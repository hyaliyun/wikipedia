He arrived at a time when the white colonists were hostile to the new French First Republic with its ideals of equality of all men, when many slaves had left the plantations and were fighting for freedom, and when the Spanish in neighboring Santo Domingo were at war with France. He started an uprising in the northern city of Cap-Fran√ßais against the commissioners who represented the Republic. After violent clashes between white supporters of Galbaud and mulattoes and newly freed slaves who supported the commissioners he was forced to flee to the United States with many of the dissident planters and their families. Early years Fran√ßois Thomas Galbaud du Fort was born on 25 September 1743 in Le Fort, Nantes. He was baptized in Notre Dame, Nantes, on 28 November 1743. His parents were Fran√ßois Galbaud Dufort and Agn√®s Dubreuil (1717‚Äì1793). His father was conseiller du roy ma√Ætre ordinaire des comptes de Bretagne. He was one of four sons and six daughters. Galbaud became a pupil in the school of artillery in 1760, was made a lieutenant in 1762, captain in 1772. He was just tall. In 1775 he married Marie-Alexis Tobin de Saint-Aubin. His wife was a Creole whose family owned considerable property in Saint- Domingue. Their three sons all later entered the army. Galbaud fought during the American Revolutionary War. After this he was stationed in the garrison at Strasbourg until the French Revolution of 1789. He was recommended for the cross of the Order of Saint Louis in 1788 on the basis of long service, the only decoration he received. He supported the revolution, and was one of the founders of the Jacobin club of Strasbourg in January 1790. Later he was in the Jacobin club in Metz. When he missed promotion in the spring of 1791 he complained of discrimination due to his revolutionary views. Galbaud became a lieutenant-colonel in 1791. He was promoted by Louis XVI to mar√©chal de camp in 1792, the last promotion made by the king. In 1792 he served under General Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez. Galbaud attempted to lead 1,500 troops to reinforce the Verdun garrison, but it surrendered before he arrived. However, he stopped the enemy in an action on the Biesme ridge, and participated in the Battle of Valmy on 20 September 1792. He was sent to negotiate a local armistice with the Prussian forces, and spoke with their commander the Duke of Brunswick, by his account giving a bold defense of France. Galbaud was noticed, and several influential proprietors of Saint-Domingue in Paris thought he would be a suitable governor for the colony. Galbaud was appointed Governor General of the Windward Islands, then on 6 February 1793 this was changed to Governor General of Saint-Domingue in place of Jean-Jacques d'Esparbes. His mother, who owned property in Saint-Domingue, died a few days later, and Galbaud was a co-heir. Under the law of 4 April 1792 this disqualified Galbaud from becoming governor. He informed the Minister of the Navy of the problem, but when he received no reply he left Brest at the start of April on the frigate Concorde and reached Cap-Fran√ßais (Cap-Ha√Øtien) on 7 May 1793. Saint-Domingue Haiti, formerly Saint-Domingue. Cap-Fran√ßais is now called Cap-Ha√Øtien Saint-Domingue was in turmoil at this time, since the white settlers were hostile to the civil commissioners L√©ger-F√©licit√© Sonthonax and √âtienne Polverel. Some of the whites wanted the monarchy restored. Meanwhile, slaves in the interior had revolted. General √âtienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux was trying with difficulty to keep the peace in Cap-Fran√ßais in the north. Galbaud should have waited to be confirmed as governor by the civil commissioners, who were in Port-au-Prince. Instead he took an oath of office on the day of his arrival and made a speech that seemed to tell the white colonists that they could count on his support. On 8 May 1793 he wrote a letter to Polv√©rel and Sonthonax announcing his arrival, but did not forward dispatches from the government that gave them instructions on the war with Spain and Britain. The commissioners arrived at Cap-Fran√ßais on 10 June 1793, where they were welcomed by the colored people but received a cold reception from the whites. They heard that Galbaud was friendly with the faction that was hostile to the commission, and did not intend to obey the commissioners. Relations between Galbaud and the commissioners were extremely strained from the start. Galbaud would not accept the \\"citizens of 4 April\\" into his entourage, or make \\"all the concubines of the city the social equals of his wife.\\" Polv√©rel and Sonthonax asked Galbaud to resign, and when he refused they dismissed him on 12 June 1793. The commissioners interviewed Galbaud, who confirmed he would not obey their orders and could show that the obstacle of his property ownership had been waived. On 13 June 1793 Polv√©rel and Sonthonax proclaimed that they had dismissed Galbaud and ordered him to embark on the Normande, sail to France and give an account of his conduct to the National Convention. A long letter has been preserved that Galbaud wrote to the National Convention from prison protesting his arrest. The commissioners held a fete on 19 June 1793 to which they invited many free women of color, either married to men of color or whites. Cap-Fran√ßais burning during the revolt The white colonists stirred up the sailors of the fleet in the Cap-Fran√ßais harbor against the commissioners. On the 20 June 1793 Galbaud proclaimed that he was resuming office and called for assistance in expelling the civil commissioners. He landed at 3:30 pm at the head of 3,000 men, who met no resistance at first. Colonel Antoine Chanlatte took command of the white and colored troops who had come to the aid of the commissioners. He was helped by Jean-Baptiste Belley, a free black who later became a member of the national convention. Street fighting ensued in which the supporters of the commissioners, although greatly outnumbered, gained the upper hand and captured Galbaud's brother and several naval officers. Fires broke out in the town. Galbaud retired with his force to the ships, but landed again at dawn on 21 June 1793 and captured the arsenal from its colored defenders. The commissioners and colored men retreated to the strong point of Haut-du-Cap. The sailors and other whites began to loot the city, ignoring Galbaud's orders. They were joined by several hundred black insurgents whom the commissioners had freed but not armed, and who joined in the destruction along with the slaves resident in the town. The freed blacks and the city slaves, led by Pierrot, Macaya and Goa, came to understand that the commissioners were on their side. Directed by the mulattoes they attacked the sailors and the whites who had joined them. After a violent struggle the whites panicked and retreated to the ships, including Galbaud, but kept control of the arsenal. The commissioners found themselves in an extremely difficult position, since they depended on the support of the black insurgents, and the Spanish were making attractive offers of emancipation if the slaves came over to their side. On 21 June 1793 they proclaimed that all blacks who would fight for them against the Spanish and other enemies would be given their freedom. This policy revived an edict the king had issued in 1784 but that had not been implemented due to resistance from the planters. The proclamation of 21 June turned out to be the turning point in the struggle, and in the broader movement to emancipate the slaves. In a council of war on 22 June 1793 Galbaud decided to destroy the guns of all the batteries that could harm the fleet, thus destroying the city's defenses against the English. It was then decided that the whole fleet would sail to the United States, and from there to France. The freed insurgents joined the white and mulatto forces loyal to the commissioners and drove the sailors out of the arsenal and the city on 22‚Äì23 June. Most of Cap Francais had been burned down by 23 June 1893. Galbaud fled to Baltimore in a fleet of 120 ships carrying 10,000 refugees. The fleet left for the United States on 24‚Äì25 June. That night Rear Admiral Joseph de Cambis regained authority over the crew of the Jupiter, where Galbaud had taken refuge, and arrested Galbaud. However, soon after reaching the United States Galbaud managed to get the crew to again revolt against Cambis, who had to leave the ship and take refuge at the French consulate. The civil commissioners returned to Cap-Fran√ßais on 4 July 1793, where they removed disloyal officials from office and replaced them by reliable men. On 10 July 1793 they wrote to the National Convention describing what had happened, and how Galbaud had left the northern province defenseless. Gilbaud and his fellow \\"agitators\\" were accused of allying themselves \\"during the federalist period, with all of the colonists, or aristocratic and royalist merchants, in our principal commercial cities.\\" On 29 August and 31 October 1793 Sonthonax and Polverel issued decrees that emancipated all slaves in the northern and southern provinces respectively. Later career When Galbaud reached Paris in the spring of 1794 he was at once thrown into Abbaye prison under suspicion of being a royalist. His wife was active in working for his release, and he was given parole after eight months. He could not rejoin the army, but found work in the office of the Committee of Public Safety. A month after Napoleon's coup of November 1799 he rejoined the army, and was assigned to Egypt, where he was accompanied by his wife. He arrived in Egypt in 1800 with the rank of brigadier-general. Galbaud died of the plague in 1801 in Cairo, Egypt.

The northern part of the district is on the high uplifted Atsbi Horst (with metamorphic rock and consolidated Palaeozoic fluvio-glacial deposits) , whereas the southern part is dominated by the Des‚Äôa forest on Antalo Limestone. In between there is the fluvial landscape of Hayqi Meshal. Particularities in the southern part of the district are soil catenas on intervening plains behind tufa dams and in a polje.  Factors contributing to soil diversity  = Climate = Annual rainfall depth is very variable with an average of around 800 mm. Most rains fall during the main rainy season, which typically extends from June to September. Mean temperature in woreda town Atsbi is 17 ¬∞C, oscillating between average daily minimum of 9.4 ¬∞C and maximum of 24.3 ¬∞C. The contrasts between day and night air temperatures are much larger than seasonal contrasts. = Geology= The following geological formations are present in the southern part: * Agula Shale * Antalo Limestone * Quaternary alluvium and freshwater tufa On the northern Atsbi Horst: * Enticho Sandstone, forming mesas and table mountains * Edaga Arbi Glacials, forming the somewhat lower, undulating plateau = Topography = As part of the Ethiopian highlands the land has undergone a rapid tectonic uplift, leading the occurrence of plateaus, valleys and gorges. = Land use = Generally speaking the level lands and intermediate slopes are occupied by cropland, while there is rangeland and shrubs on the steeper slopes. Remnant forests occur around Orthodox Christian churches, in a few inaccessible places and especially in the Des‚Äôa forest. A recent trend is the widespread planting of eucalyptus trees. = Environmental changes = Soil degradation in this district became important when humans started deforestation almost 5000 years ago. Depending on land use history, locations have been exposed in varying degrees to such land degradation.  Geomorphic regions and soil units  Given the complex geology and topography of the district, it has been organised into land systems - areas with specific and unique geomorphic and geological characteristics, characterised by a particular soil distribution along the soil catena. Soil types are classified in line with World Reference Base for Soil Resources and reference made to main characteristics that can be observed in the field. = Enticho Sandstone plateau = Typical

cover, combined with steep slopes and erosive rainfall has led to excessive soil erosion. Nutrients and organic matter were lost and soil depth was reduced. Hence, soil erosion is an important problem, which results in low crop yields and biomass production. As a response to the strong degradation and thanks to the hard labour of many people in the villages, soil conservation has been carried out on a large scale since the 1980s and especially 1980s; this has curbed rates of soil loss. Measures include the construction of infiltration trenches, stone bunds, check dams, small reservoirs such as Addi Shihu and Era as well as a major biological measure: exclosures in order to allow forest regeneration. On the other hand, it remains difficult to convince farmers to carry out measures within the farmland (in situ soil management), such as bed and furrows or zero grazing, as there is a fear for loss of income from the land. Such techniques are however very effective.  References  Category:Soil geography of Tigray (Ethiopia) ","title":"Soil in Atsbi Wenberta"},{"id":"62216597","text":"Remlinger is a surname.

Heffernan recalls that, in 1949, her family moved to work in the Jervios Ranges, far east and towards the Queensland border, where her father had gotten a job with Kurt Johannsen working on a copper mine which had been abandoned. The family stayed there for a year, until her now pregnant mother wanted to return to Alice Springs were she would have the support of family, and family midwives, for the birth. Shortly after this they then went to Yambah Station where, again, they stayed for about a year. Finally, in 1951, Heffernan's family settled, for some time, in Alice Springs where they lived at Middle Camp (on Charles Creek) and it is here where she was forced to start attending school at the former Bungalow at the Alice Springs Telegraph Station, which was by then functioning as an Aboriginal Reserve. Heffernan recalls that: \\"The old people worried that this school business didn't fit well with our culture. It didn't allow time for ceremony and teaching old ways, But nobody asked them.\\" She was allowed to go home at night. In 1953 the family were \\"as good as pushed\\" into going to live at Santa Teresa (now the Ltyentye Apurte Community) and, once there, Heffernan was forced to live separately from her family in dormitory accommodation associated with the school and was only allowed to visit her family on weekends. Heffernan finished school in the late-1950s. Following school, in Heffernan's early adulthood, she worked in the Amoonguna kitchens where she met her husband Tommy Dixon, an Anmatyerr man from Napperby Station. In the early years of their marriage, they travelled between Napperby Station and Santa Teresa.  Career  Heffernan started working in linguistics after starting as a bilingual education teacher at Santa Teresa School which inspired her to study a Diploma of Linguistics at Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education. At Batchelor she collaborated with linguist Gavan Breen and, together, they developed the Arrernte orthography. Following this, she went on the teach at the Institute for Aboriginal Development and Yipirinya School. Additionally she has worked with Margaret James on the Central Arrernte language versions of the Honey Ant Readers. In 2018, Heffernan published her autobiography, supported by Gerard Waterford and Francis Coughlan with the aim of helping young people maintain their traditions to keep Arrernte families and language strong; the book is: Gathering Sticks: lighting up small fires, and was published by IAD Press. , she lives at Hidden Valley, a town camp of Alice Springs, with her daughters.

It was the first major case of transgender discrimination in retail in Canada. The Tribunal rejected her initial complaints in 2019. Early life, education, and career Yaniv says that since she was six, she has been transgender, but was afraid to be open about it. In her teens she was treated for gender identity disorder with associated depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Yaniv attended Kwantlen Polytechnic University in Surrey, British Columbia, studying computer science. In 2008, she gained her first public attention, when she used Facebook to call for a National Sex Day on August 21. As part of the campaign, she sent out free condoms on request. She later revealed it was a viral marketing promotion. The promotion attracted over 100,000 Facebook users. Yaniv worked in call centres and tech support. That led to her creating her own business, which provided internet support to customers. She ran the business for several years under her birth name, before legally changing her first name to \\"Jessica\\", while keeping her last name. Activism Yaniv is known in the Township of Langley for her advocacy on a number of issues before Township council. She spoke on a wide range of issues including providing feminine hygiene products, asking for funding of her campaign for the Miss BC pageant title, and single-use plastics. A significant portion of her advocacy was on gender issues, such as seeking an end to segregation in physical education classes that was based on gender. She also proposed and was an advocate for the \\"all-bodies swim\\" at a Langley township public pool. The event was to be for ages 12 and up, clothing above the waist optional, and parents and caretakers would be prohibited. Human Rights Tribunal complaints In 2018, Yaniv filed discrimination complaints with the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal against multiple waxing salons alleging that they refused to provide Brazilian waxes to her because she is transgender. Yaniv's case was the first major case of transgender discrimination in retail in Canada. Yaniv was seeking as much as $15,000 in damages from each beautician. In response to the complaints, several of the estheticians said that they lacked the required training to wax male genitalia, or that they were not comfortable doing so for religious or personal reasons. Thus, for them, being transgender was not the issue, but having male genitalia was. Yaniv rejected the claim that special training in waxing male genitalia was necessary. Most of the respondents were typically working from home, were non-white, and were immigrants who did not speak English. Two of the businesses were forced to shut down due to the complaints. In October 2019, the Tribunal ruled against Yaniv and ordered her to pay $6,000 in restitution split equally among three of the service providers. The ruling was critical of Yaniv, with Devyn Cousineau stating that she \\"targeted small businesses, manufactured the conditions for a human rights complaint, and then leveraged that complaint to pursue a financial settlement from parties who were unsophisticated and unlikely to mount a proper defence.\\" The tribunal concluded that she had been financially motivated in 10 of the 13 complaints, was untruthful on the central aspect of her complaint, and had made \\"scurrilous attacks\\" on one of the respondents. Cousineau added that Yaniv was \\"motivated to punish racialized and immigrant women based on her perception that certain ethnic groups, namely South Asian and Asian communities are 'taking over' and advancing an agenda hostile to the interests of LGBTQ+ people.\\" For this reason the court ruled not only that, since none of the salons advertised waxing services for male genitals, they did not discriminate against Yaniv on the basis of her gender identity, but also rejected the complaint regarding the refusal to wax Yaniv's arms and legs. An appeal by Yaniv against the verdict was rejected in November 2019. Of Yaniv, the ruling also said: \\"Once her identity and role in these complaints was revealed, she faced a torrent of backlash and hatred, and from that point onward was representing herself in very difficult circumstances.\\" On January 7, 2020, the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms (JCCF), which had represented three of the respondents, announced it was representing another salon in an additional complaint filed by Yaniv in early October 2019. This represented the eighth complaint filed with the Tribunal by her, and Yaniv told CTV News that this time she believed case law was in her favour. The Tribunal ruled that any complaint by her would be deferred for six months due to her failure to pay fines imposed by Tribunal. In September 2020 it was announced that Yaniv had dropped the complaints against two salons. In August 2020, Yaniv filed a new civil suit for $11,800 against three of the female beauticians involved in the Tribunal case. In an email to the National Post, she said that she paid the money owed to the beauticians in the tribunal case, but they had failed to remove related liens placed against her; so, she had to sue to protect her assets. =Impact and reactions= Adrienne Smith, a BC human rights lawyer, said the case with Yaniv reversed much of the success the trans community had enjoyed with the tribunal in recent times. Smith said a major problem was that Yaniv had no legal representation, which allowed to Yaniv to make serious errors, such as making negative comments on social media during the proceedings, which a lawyer would have prevented. Smith said it showed a need for better Legal Aid funding, so there would be representation for cases like this. The Canadian Legal Information Institute (CanLII) noted that \\"those seeking to undermine the human rights regime, or to suggest that human rights have gone too far (typically in their objections to its inclusion of gender identity and gender expression), widely utilized the news stories around this case to make their point.\\" The CanLII also noted \\"This case was also notable for the public spectacle it created outside of the Tribunal. It was characterized by incredible levels of hostility\\". Arwa Mahdawi of the The Guardian criticized that fact the case has been largely covered by the right- wing media, who normally aren't concerned with the marginalized groups they show concern for in the Yaniv case. Mahdawi said that a woman who feels uncomfortable working with a penis should not be called a bigot, as Yaniv suggested, and such a claim \\"...makes a mockery of the hate crimes that are committed against trans people every day.\\" In the Toronto Star, Joanna Chiu reported that numerous transgender people had experienced a significant increase in online hate against them, as a result of coverage of the Yaniv tribunal case. Chiu said transgender advocates \\"...worry the ruling could embolden transphobia, while the public loses sight of how marginalized the community still is in Vancouver.\\" Following the filing of the complaint, Yaniv \\"has become embroiled in Twitter feuds with conservative figures, appeared on the radio show of American conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and been the subject of dozens of news articles and opinion pieces\\". Jones and several other media outlets had used Yaniv's case to rile their followers. The case garnered international attention, including a segment on Tucker Carlson's Fox News channel show. It was also cited as a factor in the Australian Liberal- National Coalition's decision to oppose a proposed gender self-identification law in Victoria, Australia and was cited by Senator Pauline Hanson in the Parliament of Australia in support of the Australian Education Legislation Amendment (Prohibiting the Indoctrination of Children) Bill 2020. Weapons charge Yaniv was arrested by the Langley RCMP detachment on August 8, 2019, after she displayed a taser in her possession in a YouTube video, that was live streamed. She had been debating with fellow YouTuber Blaire White when she allegedly displayed a prohibited weapon. Commenting on the case, police noted the weapon was not directed at anyone. When police raided her home, they seized two conducted electrical weapons. Yaniv appeared in Surrey Provincial Court on January 13, 2020 to face weapons charges. Yaniv sued the Township of Langley for $35,000 over her treatment surrounding her arrest. She said that the cells at the jail were unsanitary with bed bugs, and apparent faeces on surfaces. She said a guard failed to provide her with diabetes medication or victim services. She also said that staff refused to use correct pronouns when referring to her. According to Mathew Claxton in the Aldergrove Star, the Surrey Court registry indicates Yaniv was found guilty of a charge of possession of a prohibited weapon. Alleged online harassment =By Yaniv= According to Joseph Brean of the National Post, Yaniv has been accused by multiple people of harassment. This includes claims she used vulgar and sexualized language in online communications with underage girls. Yaniv has denied these allegations. One of the allegations, was by a girl from Washington State, who said that Yaniv made declarations of sexual interest over social media when the girl was 14 years old, allegations Yaniv has strenuously denied. The girl shared a recording of Yaniv with the National Post, where Yaniv made sexual comments using the voice of Elmo from Sesame Street. Yaniv said the recording was a joke, not sent to the girl, but to a friend. =Of Yaniv= In 2019, interactions on Twitter by Canadian feminist author Meghan Murphy and Jessica Yaniv resulted in Murphy being banned from the platform. Murphy had misgendered Yaniv by calling her a \\"him\\", in violation of Twitter's hate and harassment policy. Murphy unsuccessfully sued Twitter over the ban. Twitter also banned Lindsay Shepherd, a Canadian columnist, from its platform in 2019 as a result of interactions with Yaniv. Yaniv tweeted a comment regarding Shephard's uterus, to which Shephard replied by insulting Yaniv and referring to Yaniv as a \\"man\\". Twitter advised Shephard she had violated its rules against hateful content.

The work is now in the Gem√§ldegalerie (Painting Gallery) of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Berlin State Museums). Analysis The painting depicts two monkeys shackled to an iron ring beneath an archway. Behind them, in the background, lies the city of Antwerp. The monkeys are red-capped mangabeys and, due to Antwerp's status as a port city, were probably taken from their natural habitat by animal traders. Bruegel likely drew the symbol of two chained monkeys from Quattrocento Italian artist Gentile da Fabriano's Adoration of the Magi. In that work, two monkeys are seen similarly chained under the central arc. Simultaneously paralleling and reinventing the meaning of the monkeys in Gentile's work, Bruegel used the chained monkeys to symbolize the follies of men and how they chain themselves and each other, according to art critic Kelly Grovier. Margaret A. Sullivan of Montana State University corroborates, stating that the two monkeys are seen as a \\"small allegory\\" of \\"foolish sinners, and their imprisonment is the result of an immoderate attitude towards material wealth.\\" Specifically, Sullivan finds that the left monkey symbolizes avarice and greed while the right monkey represents prodigality. Sullivan drew these conclusions based on observations that Two Monkeys exhibits a \\"fundamental resemblance\\" to another of Bruegel's paintings, Dull Gret (Mad Meg). Exhibition To mark the 450th anniversary of Bruegel's death, Two Monkeys, along with other works, was exhibited in Bruegel - The Hand of the Master in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna from October 2, 2018‚ÄìJanuary 13, 2019. For the exhibition, the Gem√§ldegalerie performed an in-depth technical analysis of the painting from January‚ÄìAugust 2017. Examination methods included tree-ring dating; stereomicroscope investigation; and UV radiation, X-ray imaging, infrared reflectography, and X-ray fluorescence analyses. As a result, museum restorer and copyist Bertram Lorenz was able to reconstruct the painting. Related works Polish poet and Nobel Prize winner Wis≈Çawa Szymborska wrote the poem \\"Two Monkeys by Bruegel\\" describing her reaction to the painting.

Life Evans was born in Coventry in 1910. She worked for the local public library service from 1927. In 1933 she had become a fallow of the Library Association and in 1935 she was in Ann Arbor working at the library of the University of Michigan. She returned to Coventry and she was at the Public Library until 1941. From 1945 she was working in the Gold Coast as the librarian for the British Council. In 1946, John Aglionby, Bishop of Accra donated ¬£1000 of his own money to found the Ghana Library Board. She was promoted to the Gold Coast Library Board in 1949 and served in that capacity for just a year, when it was recognised by statute. She was able to start the first library service and she became the first Chief Librarian in the Gold Coast; and in time she was the first Director of Library Services. She was an advisor to UNESCO and in this capacity she advised the emerging library services in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Ghana. In 1954, she helped form the West Africa Library Association in Ghana and four years later she was the association's president. The WALA would in time create the Ghana Library Association in 1962. While in Ghana she became close friends with Erica Powell who had an unusual role as the President's private secretary and constant companion. In 1960 her MBE of 1955 was upgraded to a CBE. In 1961 Evans went on a \\"world tour\\" of libraries visiting many in Africa and other emerging countries. In 1964 she published A Tropical Library Service: The Story of Ghana's Libraries. She left her role in the Gold Coast in 1965. Since her arrival in 1945 the Gold Coast had gone from no libraries to over twenty. She had developed a library service for children and she had always planned that the service would in time not be run by the British. In 1967 she was in Libya and Ceylon for UNESCO and she remained in Ceylon until 1970 by which time she had designed the legislation that would create the Ceylon National Library Services Board. In 1975 she was invited back to Ghana to join in the celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the library service she had initiated. The 1950 Ghana Library Board Act had not only created the service but it had committed the government to support it. Ghana was said to have had the first national library service in sub-Saharan Africa which was a model for other countries. Appraisal It is conceded that Evans made substantial progress establishing a legal and organisational framework as well as a national library service with a number of libraries aimed at both adults and children. Evans spent five years in Ghana persuading everyone that they needed a \\"proper library\\" system but that definition was never defined. Evans assumed that the country needed a library system identical to the one she had seen in Britain. An alternative bottom up approach was proposed and tried by a young Ugandan named William Serwadda in Uganda. He created an alternative approach that he planned would exploit radio to deliver literacy; but he lacked the political backing that Evans enjoyed. Ghana's first President, Kwame Nkrumah, would give speeches supporting Evans, he opened libraries and he wrote an introduction for her 1964 book.

Sampan panjang was a type of Malay fast boat from the 19th century. It was used especially by the sampan-men, or \\"Orang Laut\\" (lit. \\"sea men\\"). Historically, they can be found in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. This type of boat was used by Malay people as racing boat and as transport boat. The sampan panjang appeared at the first quarter of the 19th century, and disappeared at the turn of that century. These boats proved to be superior than European boats in racing purposes; they were easy winners when racing against the European yachts of that time. Etymology The name sampan panjang comes from the Malay words sampan, meaning boat, which in turn derived from Chinese dialectal sam-pan or san-pan, and panjang, meaning long; thus, the name means \\"long boat\\". It is also called perahu panjang, since the words sampan and perahu in Malay language are synonymous. History The first record of sampan panjangs comes from Singapore Chronicle for Thursday, 15 May 1834. It describes a rowing match between 4 Malay sampans and boats from three vessels lying in the roads, which as usual was won easily by the Malays.Singapore Chronicle for Thursday, 15 May, 1834 A book by G. W. Earl from 1837 provides an early description of the sampan panjang. At that time the boat was 30 ft (9 m) long and 4 ft (1.2 m) wide. It had two masts with large lateens, loose-footed dipping lugsails. It was steered using a long, diamond-shaped paddle, which could also be used to increase speed. It carried five crewmen.Earl, G. W. 1837. The Eastern Seas, xii + 461 pp., Wm. H. Allen, London. Some years later the Sultan of Lingga acquired a fine sailing sampan panjang, ordered from Trengganu, which had a long and most successful racing career. In 1839 he challenged the fastest of the European yachts in the settlement to a race for $500 a side. The challenge was accepted by the owner of the Maggie Lauder, a well-known boat in her day. They followed the New Years Day regatta course, which then covered about 14 miles, and the Malay boat came in with the Maggie still seven miles from the finishing line. A passenger sampan panjang from about 1860: Drawn from a boat shown in Gray's engraving of the Singapore waterfront, which dated from 1861. Dr. Berncastle in 1850 describes the sampan panjang as very light boats and was elegant in shape. He notes that the sampans were propelled by paddles or lateen sails made of mats. The latter also appear in Gray's engraving of the Singapore water front, and would seem to have been in fairly general use from this period onwards, if not earlier.Berncastle, Dr. 1850. A voyage to China. 2 vols, Shobert, London. Development of the sampan panjang continued during the third quarter of the century. The lines became finer, the hull rather longer, and a bowsprit was added to set a headsail: a light rudder was also introduced in this period, and occasionally passenger boats were built with \\"counter\\" type stern or narrow transom. The sampan panjang started to decline after the first wharf of Tanjong Pagar came into operation in 1866. The opening of the Suez canal made many steamers flood the area of the sampan panjang, which resulted in the decrease of their number. Mitman (1923: p. 258) writes rather condescendingly of the maker of sampan panjang: By the last quarter of the century it was being made with hull lengths of 40 ft. (12.2 m) and over, and some example had 3 masts. Such boats were expensive to build and maintain. They required crews, with some experience, of 20-25 men for racing purposes, but the hull and yards were beyond the means of a Malay kampong which alone could have produced the men on an amateur basis. They were, in fact, suitable only for local magnates, and then all that could be done with one was to race against another sampan panjang. The size of the crew required to man them, the ease with which they shipped water and the lack of finish inside the hull, made them useless for cruising purposes.Mitman, C. W. 1923. Catalogue of the watercraft collection in the U.S. National Museum. Bull. U.S. Nat. Mus., 127, 298 pp. By the middle 1880s there were probably less than ten serviceable racing hulls afloat. In 1885 only two were entered for their class in the annual New Years Day regatta compared to 37 of the previous twenty year. According to Buckley, by 1902, only four were still in commission in Johnston's pier, and even these did not last until the beginning of the first world war. By this time the racing sampan itself had also been outmoded, and its place taken by the lighter kolek Johore, which as the Johore racing kolek remains the most prominent feature of all local regattas.Buckley, C. B. (1902). An anecdotal history of old time in Singapore. Singapore: Fraser & Neave.

Gameplay  Inspired by Agar.io, Jaws.io is a multiplayer game where the goal is pick up or eat (depending on whether the player is controlling a ship or a shark) as much as possible, in order to obtain the highest score in time-limited matches. Players would take on the role as the captain of a boat rescuing civilians of Amity Island stranded out at sea. As players sailed around picking up civilians, they were to use power-ups to combat against other boats as well as the titular Jaws. Players would also be given the opportunity to transform into Jaws for a short period in the match to wreak havoc against other opponents. The gameplay used touch controls to maneuver around in a manner similar to that of games found in the .io game genre with comparisons drawn towards Slither.io and Agar.io. The players were able to receive rewards for logging in each day, and coins collected in each play could have been used for certain shark upgrades.

It was designed by Charles Benson and built at the expense of George Bullock in 1869‚Äì70. Today the church forms part of the Five Crosses benefice. History All Saints was built as a chapel of ease to St John's in Yeovil. A church serving Yeovil Marsh and its surrounding neighbourhood had been under discussion since earlier in the 19th century, but did not come to fruition. Instead services were held at a small thatched cottage at Yeovil Marsh by Rev. Mr. James, curate of St John's, then his successor Rev. A. H. Lutman. All Saints was built at the expense of Mr. George Bullock of East Coker, the principal landowner of the Marsh district. He spent almost ¬£2,000 to acquire the site, build the church and provide an endowment of ¬£1,000 and building fund of ¬£197. Plans for the church were drawn up by Mr. Charles Benson of Yeovil and Messrs. William Pudden and Sons of East Coker hired as the builders. The foundation stone was laid in January 1869 and the Taunton Courier reported the church as \\"approaching completion\\" in September 1869. It opened in 1870 and was consecrated by the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Right Rev. Lord Arthur Hervey, on 28 August 1871. Yeovil Marsh was made its own ecclesiastical parish in March 1872. Architecture All Saints is built of local stone sourced from the quarries at Brimsmore Tree, with dressings in Hamstone and Bridgwater tiles on the roof. Designed to accommodate 160 persons, it is made up of a nave, chancel, west porch and north-east vestry. There is a small bell turret with a single bell on the west end of the roof. The church has seven windows; the east end three-light window and the west window contain stained glass. The church's flooring is largely of deal and the aisles paved with tiles from Poole Potteries. The open panelled roof is of stained pine. The original fittings include moveable benches of stained deal, a pulpit and reading desk of oak, and a font of Bath stone. The altar rail of carved oak was transferred from one of the churches in Yeovil. The church's original harmonium, made by Messrs. Price and Son, was also supplied at the expense of Mr. Bullock.

The bar is part of an Austin, Texas-based chain of nightclubs. Andrew Jankowski of Willamette Week described Barbarella as \\"a dance club with dirt- cheap drinks, themed parties running from the '50s through the '80s and an overall vibe best described as 'a straight person's idea of a gay bar.'\\" Daily Xtra described Barbarella as a \\"video/dance dive bar\\" with dance parties, disc jockeys, and queer events in its 2019 overview of \\"gay Portland\\". The venue has two dance floors and a loft. The interior features lava lamps, pinball machines, and mid-century modern furniture. There is a painting of a topless woman on one wall, as well as two \\"tributes\\" to Jane Fonda, who starred in the 1968 science fiction film Barbarella.

The site is a Scheduled monument. Location The fort occupies a strategically position on the summit of Brough Hill, between the confluence of the River Bain and River Ure. It has views across Wensleydale and may have been placed to control a pass through the Pennines between Stainmore and the Ilkley/Aire gap. File:Virosidum (Bainbridge, North Yorkshire) -.jpgThe plateau on which Virosidium was constructed File:Old roman road, now bridle path, towards Bainbridge, Yorkshire.jpgThe Roman road near Virosidium, now a bridle path History of the fort While the fort may have had an earlier phase, the visible remains date to AD 90-105\\\\. It initially had an earth and timber rampart which was rebuilt in study around AD 190. The visible outline of the defences of the fort contains an areas of 1.16 Hectares (2.8 acres). The fort platform survives to a height of 3.9 m and it is surrounded by a single ditch on the north, east and south sides, with a series of five ditches on the west. An annexe to the fort measures 99 m x 73 m. The site was abandoned between 120 and 160. The fort interior was rebuilt in the early third century by the Cohors VI Nerviorum. Rebuilding across the whole site took place in the late fourth century, with pottery evidence suggesting a late abandonment. Discovery and excavation In William Camden's 1586 Britannia the fort is referred to under the name Bracchium and this name persisted in early editions of the Ordnance Survey maps. The fort was first excavated by John Kirk and R. G. Collingwood in 1925-6, then by Droop for Liverpool University in 1928-9 and 1931. Under lease to Leeds University, further excavations were directed by William V. Wade in 1950-3 and by Brian Hartley annually from 1956 to 1969. =Finds= Five individual inscriptions have been discovered from the fort; three of these were dedicated by the Cohors VI Nerviorum, and a further two are dedicated to individual units. The small finds from the 1956-1969 excavations and a small number of those from the 1920s excavations were deposited with the Yorkshire Museum (ID - YORYM: 2016.201). Post-Roman Bainbridge There is no clear evidence of continuity into the fifth century at the fort. However, a pair of post-Roman burials were discovered in the principia. One is of an adult aged 36-45 years old and the other of a woman aged 46+ years. Radiocarbon dating of the skeletal remains dated them to the ninth or tenth centuries AD. Isotope analysis of the strontium and oxygen values of their teeth found that the woman was probably local to the Yorkshire region but that the other skeleton was from a western coastal part of Britain or continental Europe. These burials may be consistent with structural changes to the western wall of the principia and the aedes that suggest it was used as a church.

He came from a family of engineers; his father was Thomas Evans Blackwell and his grandfather was John Blackwell.  Early life  Blackwell was born at Foxhangers near Devizes, Wiltshire, on 4 February 1843. He emigrated to Canada in 1857 with his family when his father, Thomas Evans Blackwell, began employment as vice president of the Grand Trunk Railroad. Blackwell was educated at the High School of Montreal and later at McGill College.  Career  Blackwell's first employment was with the Grand Trunk Railroad under his father. He worked for the Intercolonial Railway between 1869 and 1876, supervising the company's repair shops in Moncton, New Brunswick. From 1876 he took a year's employment as resident engineer on the Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Occidental Railway, before taking the same role at the Quebec Central Railway until 1879. Blackwell next followed in his father and grandfather's footsteps by taking a role involving canals. He was employed by the Department of Railways and Canals where he worked with the Canadian Pacific Railway as well as the navigable inland waterways. Blackwell later moved to Roanoke, Virginia to superintend on the Norfolk and Western and Shenandoah Valley Railroads. From 1885 he managed the Montana division of the Union Pacific Railroad and later had engineering roles with the Central of Georgia Railway and the Toledo, St. Louis and Kansas City Railroad. In 1891 he worked for the Schoenberger Steel Company in Pittsburgh, but returned to railway engineering in 1897 to work with the receivers of the failing Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad. Blackwell's final role began in 1903, when he was employed as special assistant to the chief engineer at the Wabash Railroad. His work here was described as \\"accurate, methodical and resourceful\\". In 1874, Blackwell was elected an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers; both his father and grandfather had been members of the institution. In 1881 he was elected as a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1881.  Personal life  Blackwell married Mary Emily Margaret Chandler, known as Emily, in 1878. Chandler was the granddaughter of Edward Barron Chandler, lieutenant governor of New Brunswick. They had three sons: Thomas Edward (b. 1875), Hubert Charles (b. 1878) and John Buckland (b. 1882).

It was designed and developed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in the early 1990s in order to demonstrate the capabilities of an airborne SAR for foliage and ground penetration. However, since conducting accurate, repeatable measurements on an airborne platform was both challenging and expensive, the railSAR was built on the rooftop of a four-story building within the Army Research Laboratory compound along a 104-meter laser-leveled track. At the time, the railSAR fell into the highest category of UWB radar systems, operating across a 950 MHz-wide band from 40 MHz to 1 GHz on a pulse strength of 2.5 megawatts. It provided fully polarimetric, high resolution radar data and possessed 185% bandwidth compared to other radar systems that had less than 25% bandwidth. Applications of the railSAR technology range from military uses such as detecting landmines and stationary targets in hiding for reconnaissance purposes to commercial uses, including cable and pipe detection, oil and water table measurements, and environmental remediation.  Development  The development of the railSAR began in 1988 as part of an exploratory research program that aimed to create technology that could detect targets camouflaged or hidden by trees and foliage cover. While early efforts faced considerable challenges, advancements in analog-to-digital (A/D) converter technology, source technology, and signal-processing power allowed ARL researchers to produce a realizable system and grasp a better understanding of foliage and ground penetrating radar. Attention was focused particularly on analyzing the basic phenomenology of impulse radar, especially the propagation effects of targets, clutter, and targets embedded in clutter. The railSAR had four 4.5 ft long, linear 200-ohm TEM horn antennas, two for transmitting and two for receiving, mounted on a rotating, non-conducting frame that was anchored on a hinged plate constructed out of aluminum honeycomb and covered in anechoic foam. The two transmit antennas were linearly polarized at ¬±45 degrees, and the two receive antennas had a low noise preamp and a PIN diode receiver protector. The design of the antenna was originally produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). An additional 0.5 meters of resistively loaded parallel plate section on the radiating end of the antennas improved the return loss at the high frequencies by absorbing some of the energy at the open aperture. An impulse transmitter behind the antenna assembly served to charge the antenna as well as discharge the antenna by using a hydrogen-pressured reed capsule to form the transmitted pulse. An ARL-designed programmable gate-array-based system known as the timing and control (T&C;) circuit provided drive signals to the transmitters and the receiver protectors. It also served to effectively reduce interference from other transmitters while also making sure to minimize interference to nearby receivers. Two computers passed GPIB (General Purpose Interface Bus) commands to the two Tektronix DSA602A digital oscilloscopes to measure the time between the trigger and the A/D clock edges and store the data on magneto-optical rewritable disks. The master computer controlled the movement of the cart on which the antennas were mounted. In 1995, the design of the railSAR was incorporated into the development of the boomSAR in an effort to produce a mobile, high signal-to-noise radar. By 2016, the railSAR had been moved from the rooftop of the building to an indoor facility and had been subjected to several weight reductions and redesigns.  Operation  In general, radar systems perform foliage and ground penetration more effectively with lower frequencies, because longer wavelengths can penetrate opaque structures deeper than shorter wavelengths. But in exchange for greater penetration capabilities, the lower frequencies provide a lower image resolution. Ultra-wideband radar is able to overcome this limitation in resolution by transmitting extremely narrow pulses, hence ‚Äúimpulse,‚Äù to obtain a sufficiently wide bandwidth. However, pulse shortness comes at the cost of peak power, so much so that the peak power per frequency drops below the threshold of frequency selective receivers. While the low power makes it difficult for eavesdroppers to detect the signal, the disadvantage of this trade-off manifests as significant increases in processing cost. In order to reliably receive a UWB signal given such low power per frequency, the UWB radar system must either open itself to noise with the use of a high sampling rate receiver, incorporate signal average which lowers the data rate, or increase to high signal transmit power which presents interference to other receivers. In addition, a wider bandwidth may increase the likelihood of false alarms. However, the combination of low frequency and high resolution present in UWB radars proved to be extremely desirable for foliage and ground penetration, in which the increased bandwidth presented a distinct advantage over its costs. In an effort to attain the necessary frequencies for adequate penetration while balancing the processing costs associated with ultra- wideband, the railSAR was designed to identify mine clusters over very large areas rather than detect each individual mine hidden in the soil and foliage. The railSAR was initially constructed to look north over the north parking lot of the ARL compound as its target area, which was mainly populated by deciduous trees. The radar system required about 80 hours to collect one complete aperture of high-resolution, fully polarimetric data. Its peak power was at 500 kW with a pulse repetition frequency of 40 Hz, and the average transmitted power was about 20 mW. Creating the radar image required the railSAR to limit the Fourier processing to very small patches within the image area. Despite its use of low-frequency signals, the railSAR was capable of achieving high resolution by moving along the rail and transmitting and receiving returns in the direction perpendicular to the line of motion along the rail. During performance analysis tests, the railSAR achieved a recognition probability of 90 percent with a relatively low false-alarm rate.Closer inspection revealed that the individual false alarms were generally triggered by objects in the images rather than random noise.

Life and persecution by the Police The details of his early life are unknown but his involvement with the anarchist movement began in the early 1980s when he joined a local underground organization self-titled as the \\"Union of Anarchists\\". His first serious incident with the authorities occurred in 1987 when he is arrested along with Clearchos Smyrnaios in an apartment, after an attempt to steal a radio from a government car. In the same incident, a friend and comrade of his, Michalis Parkas, is shot dead by Special Counterterrorism forces when he went out onto the balcony to negotiate with the police. In the years that followed, after being acquitted of his first involvement in an unlawful act but radicalized by the death of his friend, he followed a steady course in his beliefs, a fact that gradually led him to isolate himself from his former comrades. In a televised appearance and a question asked by a journalist Elli Stai why he continues, while other members of the same ideological space have withdrawn, he replied that not everyone can bear the burden of state persecution. In the last few months before his death, he suffered from some psychological problems caused by his many years of activity and his frustration that seemed to be compounded by the behavior of some of his old comrades. He was a student at the University of Patras. Death There is a general haze around the circumstances surrounding his death, which occurred on July 23, 1996. While on house arrest, he travelled to the island of Serifos. When returning, Police -a Special Operations Unit, (EKAM)- raided his cabin and was found dead. He was shot and a gun was found next to him. The Greek authorities have attributed his death to suicide. The exact circumstances of his death were investigated by the Piraeus Port Authority but were never disclosed. Possibly related is the fact that the same night another anarchist testified that he was present at the shooting of police officer Nikos Vaiopoulos, a PASOK office guard, by Marinos on July 5, 1996. Legacy For Greek anarchists, he was an uncompromising symbol against capitalism, state dominance and control. In Marinos' memory are dedicated verses of Alkis Alkaios \\"Always Laughing (Isaac, Solomon and Marinos Martyrs)\\" composed by Thanos Mikroutsikos and sung by Dimitris Mitropanos.

It is visible to the naked eye, with the brightest component being an orange-hued star with an apparent visual magnitude of 5.03. The system is located at a distance of approximately 269 light years from the Sun based on parallax, and is drifting further away with radial velocities of 3‚Äì5 km/s. This system can be resolved in a telescope as a pair of stars with an angular separation of along a position angle of 272¬∞, as of 2018. They share a common motion through space and thus appear to be physically associated, with a wide projected separation of or greater. If they are bound in an orbit, the estimated period is approximately 28,000 years. The brighter member of this system is an aging giant or bright giant star with a stellar classification of K0II-III. It has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and expanded to 20 times the girth of the Sun. This is a suspected variable that has been recorded ranging in brightness from magnitude 4.98 down to 5.06. The star is radiating 173 times the luminosity of the Sun from its swollen photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,688 K. The fainter component at magnitude 6.57 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 7.33 days and an eccentricity of 0.26. The primary member of this pair is an A-type main- sequence star with a stellar classification of A9V. It is a metallic-lined Am star with 2.9 times the radius of the Sun. The star is radiating 24 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 7,476 K. It has a relatively low projected rotational velocity of under 20 km/s, and it is suspected the rotations of this binary system may be synchronized. The system is a source for X-ray emission, which is most likely coming from the secondary.

Unlike hydroelectric plants powered by water from mountain streams, it used water from Big Springs, which collected behind an earthen dam and was transported by a conduit pipe to the Fountain Green powerhouse. The powerhouse is a relatively small structure holding only two turbine units. It has a simple architectural style containing elements of Art Moderne. Two ancillary smaller brick buildings are close by; in 1988 one was in use as a garage and battery house, the other as storage.

There, water pours from a canyon wall, is captured by a small, earthen dam and diverted into a steel conduit which carries the water to the powerhouse. The plant site is not located at the mouth of a canyon, but lies in an open pasture some miles distant from the mountains. Although the plant site has a small front yard, there are few shade trees and landscaping details. About one quarter mile northwest of the plant is the foundation of the original Big Springs Electric Company hydroelectric plant. Built in 1902, this facility also used water from Big Springs. The dam at Big Springs may have also served this original hydroelectric plant, although the dam was probably rebuilt in 1922 at the time the Fountain Green facility was constructed.\\" Architecture: Modern Movement Historic function: Industry/processing/extraction Historic subfunction: Energy Facility Criteria: event, architecture/engineering With References Category:Moderne architecture in Utah Category:National Register of Historic Places in Sanpete County, Utah Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1922 ","title":"Fountain Green Hydroelectric Plant Historic District"},{"id":"62218073","text":"House at No. 17 Rua Benjamin Constant (, or Casa √† Ladeira da Cadeia, 17) is a former home and archive building in Cachoeira, Brazil. Its date of construction is unknown but is likely between the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century. The house is noted for its latticed balcony at its rear fa√ßade, which provides a view of Cachoeira, its neighboring municipality Sao Felix, and the Paragua√ßu River. The house was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1941; it now functions as the archives of the municipality of Cachoeira and may be visited. Location The House at No. 17 Rua Benjamin Constant is located on the slope above the Historic Center of Cachoeira, directly behind the Town Hall of Cachoeira (Pa√ßo Municipal) of the city, which was completed in 1712. Houses built around the town hall and its square occupied a privileged position in Cachoeira; the House at No. 17 Rua Benjamin Constant can be included in this group. The house sits on the corner of Rua Benjamin Constant and the narrow Beco do Cazuzinha. History The date of construction of this building is unknown. Its location and typology indicates a period of construction between the late 18th and early 19th centuries. No information exists on who constructed the house or its early residents. The first known resident was the Bahian musician Jos√© Joaquim de Souza Arag√£o (1819-1904), better known as Cazuzinha, who owned the house from 1900 to 1904. It was later owned by Francelino Motta, a member of the locally politically connected Motta family. The house was listed as a historic property by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1941. Francelino Motta offered to sell the house to the federal government in 1958 and requested that IPHAN carry out restoration work in 1959. It was instead sold to Pedro Angelo Jos√© Ghislandi, an engineer employed by IPHAN, in 1963. The house was jointly purchased from Ghislandi by the Federal University of Bahia, the state government of Bahia, and IPHAN in 1982 to create a regional archive; work on its adaptive reuse was completed in 1966. It became home to the municipal archives of Cachoeira in 2018. The municipal archives were moved from the Teixeira de Freitas Birthplace (Casa natal de Teixeira de Freitas) due to its state of disrepair and location close to the river, which is subject to periodic flooding. Structure The house is built on a slope, with a single story facing Rua Benjamin Constant and two stories that overlook the steep slope at rear. Various construction materials were used on the house, reflecting its renovation at different times: it is constructed partly of stone and lime and partly in wood on a stone foundation. The house was erected with a rectangular main body; a service side wing was added at a later date. The service side wing is unique to houses in Cachoeira. The front fa√ßade of the house has a main entrance door, side entrance door, and sash windows. The windows sit on simple lintels, as does the single window of the service wing. The door has tracings in stucco above and around the main entrance. A gable roof slopes from front to back and covers the balcony. The back fa√ßade of the house consists of two floors and faces a slope. The structure is noted for its covered balcony with latticed wood railing. The balcony provides a view of the city of Cachoeira, the Paragua√ßu River, and its neighboring city, S√£o F√©lix, across the river. The latticed balcony at the rear of a residence is found in two other structures Cachoeira: the Sobrado at Pra√ßa da Aclama√ß√£o, 4 and Solar Estrela; the house may be modeled after the Casa do Conde da Palma in Salvador. The back fa√ßade of the building has two doors and a straight lintel window, two columns, and masonry corner wedges. In total the house covers . The interior of the house is simple. None of its original furnishing or decor remains.

The story, set in the midst of the on-going Korean War, is considered to be one of the writer‚Äôs major works. It deals with the conflict and reconciliation between maternal and paternal grandmothers, whose sons chose different ideologies. The story mourns the pains of the war while expecting a bright future.  Title  \\"The Rainy Spell\\" is a title and the time when the story takes place. In Korea, jangma refers to a rainy season in summer, which lasts from June to July. After the period, the weather begins heating up... The rains during jangma is closely associated with how the narrative flows. Jangma starts at the beginning of the story and ends when all the conflicts are over. The rainfall is a tool showing escalating tension in the family, a metaphor for the Korean War that began in late June, and an implication that the divided Korea is not permanent but temporary .  Plot  The narrator \\"I\\" in ‚ÄúThe Rainy Spell‚Äù recalls the events that took place in his family during the Korean War in 1950. Back then his maternal uncle joins the military while his paternal uncle becomes a North Korean partisan. ‚ÄúI‚Äù, an elementary school student, unknowingly informs the whereabouts of his paternal uncle, which makes him hated by the narrator‚Äôs paternal grandmother. However, as his maternal grandmother sides with him, the relationship between his maternal and paternal grandmother gets worse. With the start of jangma, the maternal grandmother receives the death notice of her son. The following day, the maternal grandmother curses toward the mountain where partisans reportedly hide and the paternal grandmother gets angry with her. The fortune teller predicts the return of the partisan uncle and tells the day when he will return. The paternal grandmother prepares to greet him. On the day when the partisan uncle is expected to come, a big snake appears instead of him and the paternal grandmother screams and loses consciousness. When other families are in confusion, the other grandmother treats the snake like the paternal uncle and has a ceremony by plucking a few of the paternal grandmother‚Äôs hairs and burning them to lead the snake away. As the snake leaves the house, the confusion ends. The narrator‚Äôs paternal grandmother, after regaining consciousness, expressed thanks to the maternal grandmother, which leads to the reconciliation of the two. Just before her death, the paternal grandmother forgives ‚ÄúI‚Äù.  Main Themes  In ‚ÄúThe Rainy Spell‚Äù, paternal and maternal grandmothers had a good relationship but becomes in conflict because of their sons‚Äô situations. Through the family‚Äôs situation, the novel criticized the contradiction and violence of the Korean War. At the same time, it mourns those who died in the war, reconciles those who are in conflict and heals their sadness .  Style  The story of ‚ÄúThe Rainy Spell‚Äù unfolds through the first-person narrator ‚ÄúI‚Äù. ‚ÄúI‚Äù is too young to understand the conflicts in the family caused by the Korean War. However, the boy narrator eventually grows up as he experiences events that go beyond his perception. This format was widely used in works published in the 1970s by Kim Won il, Lee Dong-ha, Park Wansuh, as well as Yun Heunggil. Given that the 1970s was a period when the ideologies of the Cold War were solidified, it seems that a child narrator, who is not bound by ideology, appeared in the works to explore new prospects to overcome the division . Yun revealed that ‚ÄúThe Rainy Spell‚Äù was based on the story of the father of his friend, poet Jeong Yang. Jeong‚Äôs father disappeared just before the Korean War. It was said that a big snake came into the friend‚Äôs house on the day when a fortune teller predicted that the missing father would return . Yun also experienced the Korean War in his childhood. His mother‚Äôs side of the family lived in the house of their in-law, and his maternal uncle died during the war. Like this, ‚ÄúThe Rainy Spell‚Äù is closely related to the sensibilities of the generation who experienced the Korean War in its childhood .  Critical reception  There are largely two literary themes that Yun has continuously shown interest in. The first one is the Korean War and the country‚Äôs divided situation, and the second is the process of industrialization accelerated since the 1970s. Among them, ‚ÄúThe Rainy Spell‚Äù is a major work that deals deeply with the war and division . ‚ÄúThe Rainy Spell‚Äù is judged as a work which shows the possibility of restoring ethnic homogeneity through shamanism . Most critics agree with this idea, but opinions diverge when it comes to interpreting the ending part where the conflict between maternal and paternal grandmothers is resolved. Some criticized shamanistic behaviors that provide the cause of reconciliation in the novel while others argue that those acts can approach the source of life even though they are unrealistic . There is also an interpretation that sees ‚ÄúThe Rainy Spell‚Äù as a work focusing on the pain and sorrow of the war. From this point of view, the hostility between the two grandmothers is more of a lack of consideration than a difference of ideology or system. In addition, this interpretation believes that it is sympathy for each other, not shamanistic behaviors, which brings the reconciliation between the two grandmothers  Adaptation  The short story was adapted into a film by director Yu Hyun-mok in 1979.

Factors contributing to soil diversity  = Climate = Annual rainfall depth is very variable with an average of around 600 mm. Most rains fall during the main rainy season, which typically extends from June to September. Mean temperature in woreda town Freweyni is 18.2 ¬∞C, oscillating between average daily minimum of 10.1 ¬∞C and maximum of 25.9 ¬∞C. The contrasts between day and night air temperatures are much larger than seasonal contrasts. = Geology= From the higher to the lower locations, the following geological formations are present: * Adigrat Sandstone * Enticho Sandstone * Edaga Arbi Glacials * Precambrian metamorphic rocks = Topography = As part of the Ethiopian highlands the land has undergone a rapid tectonic uplift, leading the occurrence of mountain peaks, plateaus, valleys and gorges. = Land use = Generally speaking the level lands and intermediate slopes are occupied by cropland, while there is rangeland and shrubs on the steeper slopes. Remnant forests occur around Orthodox Christian churches and a few inaccessible places. A recent trend is the widespread planting of eucalyptus trees. = Environmental changes = Soil degradation in this district became important when humans started deforestation almost 5000 years ago. Depending on land use history, locations have been exposed in varying degrees to such land degradation.  Geomorphic regions and soil units  Given the complex geology and topography of the district, it has been organised into land systems - areas with specific and unique geomorphic and geological characteristics, characterised by a particular soil distribution along the soil catena.

Nutrients and organic matter were lost and soil depth was reduced. Hence, soil erosion is an important problem, which results in low crop yields and biomass production. As a response to the strong degradation and thanks to the hard labour of many people in the villages, soil conservation has been carried out on a large scale since the 1980s and especially 1980s; this has curbed rates of soil loss. Measures include the construction of infiltration trenches, stone bunds, check dams, small reservoirs such as Addi Abagi√®, as well as a major biological measure: exclosures in order to allow forest regeneration. On the other hand, it remains difficult to convince farmers to carry out measures within the farmland (in situ soil management), such as bed and furrows or zero grazing, as there is a fear for loss of income from the land. Such techniques are however very effective.

The district was originally known as Gilmore Township, one of five civil townships established in 1863; the name officially became \\"Ravenswood\\" in 1871, and Jackson County's townships were converted into magisterial districts in 1872.\\"Division of the County into Districts\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County, West Virginia, H.H. Hardesty & Co., New York, Toledo, and Chicago (1883).United States Census Bureau, U.S. Decennial Census, Tables of Minor Civil Divisions in West Virginia, 1870‚Äì2010. When Jackson County was redistricted in the 1990s, the area of Ravenswood District was divided between the new Northern and Western Magisterial Districts. However, the county's historic magisterial districts continue to exist in the form of tax districts, serving all of their former administrative functions except for the election of county officials.W. Va. Code ¬ß 11‚Äì3‚Äì1A. Geography Ravenswood District is one of two historic magisterial districts in the northern part of Jackson County. To the north, it is bounded by Grant District, to the east by Reedy District in Wirt County and Reedy District in Roane County; to the south by Washington, Ripley, and Union Districts, the three southern districts of Jackson County, and to the west by the northern portion of the Great Bend of the Ohio River. Across the river is Lebanon Township, in Meigs County, Ohio.United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia‚ÄìOhio, Ravenswood Quadrangle (eds. Oct. 1908, 1960, rev. 1987).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Ripley Quadrangle (eds. 1907, 1928, 1960, rev. 1975).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Liverpool Quadrangle (ed. 1994).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia‚ÄìJackson County, Sandyville Quadrangle (ed. 1960, rev. 1988).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Gay Quadrangle (ed. 1960, rev. 1987). Most of Ravenswood District is hilly, but there are bottomlands along the Ohio River and Sandy Creek. Hardesty's describes the district as containing \\"some of the best farming lands in the [s]tate; the soil on the river bottoms is sandy, while that of the hills is for the most part red clay.\\"\\"Ravenswood District\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County. =Streams= The main stream in Ravenswood District is Sandy Creek, occasionally referred to as \\"Big\\" Sandy Creek, to distinguish it from Little Sandy Creek in Grant District. The creek and its tributaries drain nearly the entire district, and empties into the Ohio River at Ravenswood. The main course divides into two forks just below Sandyville, about ten miles southeast of Ravenswood. The upper waters of the Right Fork arise in the Reedy District of Roane County, and this branch traverses the central portion of Ravenswood District from east to west. The Left Fork arises in Tucker District, Wirt County, and adjoining portions of Steele District, in Wood County, and flows through Grant District for much of its length.United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Rockport Quadrangle (ed. 1960, rev. 1975). In its upper course, the Right Fork of Sandy Creek meets with Patterson Run, Buck Run, and Hartley Run, all of which join Sandy Creek in Roane County, although the latter two flow northeast out of Ravenswood District. At Liverpool, just west of the Roane County line, Sandy meets with the Brushy Fork, flowing westward from Sandy Summit in Roane County. From Liverpool, the Right Fork turns westward, meeting with Cabin Run, Rush Run, Fallentimber Run, and Washburn Run, all coming from the north; Bear Run is a tributary of Fallentimber. The creek then meets with Coon Run, flowing from the south; at Duncan the stream is joined by Warfield Run, coming from the north, and Trap Run, from the south. Boggess Run flows southward into Sandy just below Meadowdale Church; Biglick Run flows northwest into the creek at the village of Meadowdale; then Lynncamp Run, Low Gap Run, Burgess Run, and Island Run, the last of which joins the Right Fork just below the village of Murray; Bens Run is a tributary of Lynncamp, flowing out of a hollow below Tar Hill. The Left Fork of Sandy Creek meets a number of tributaries in Grant District; just after crossing into Ravenswood District, it meets with Nesselroad Run, the majority of which is also in Grant; just above the juncture, Nesselroad is joined by another Coon Run, which lies entirely within Ravenswood District. The next tributary to join the Left Fork is Drift Run, which flows east and south out of the hills above the village of Drift Run. Just above Odaville, the creek is joined by the Turkey Fork, which flows westward out of the hills below Garfield, on the Wirt County line. Along its course, the Turkey Fork is joined by Lisez Run, Camp Run, Five Mile Run, Horner Run, the Peter Fork, and Barnes Run. Below Odaville, the Left Fork of Sandy meets with the Sarvis Fork, also flowing from the east, and the Copper Fork coming from the north; the latter flows out of the hollows in the central part of the district, where it is joined by the Squirrel Lick, then continues past the village of New Era, joining the Left Fork just above Sandyville. In its lower course, Sandy Creek is met by Beatty Run, flowing southeast out of the hills above Crow Summit; the Trace Fork, flowing northwest out of the southern part of the district; Mud Run, flowing from the south, Cherrycamp Run, from the southwest; and Wheaton Run, from the north; Bucket Run is a tributary of the Trace Fork. The Crooked Fork arises out of the hills east of Flatwoods, in Union District, then flows northeast into Ravenswood District, meeting Briar Run at Hemlock; it is then joined by the Dry Fork and Cockle Run, before joining Sandy Creek between Varner and Nuzums. At Silverton, the main branch of the creek is joined by the Straight Fork, flowing southwest out of the hills above Wilding, and Browning Run, flowing from the south. Jackson Run, Shockey Run, and Bennett Run are tributaries of the Straight Fork. Big Run joins Sandy Creek just above the beginning of the Polecat Bend. Just above Ravenswood, the creek is joined by Lick Run, flowing out of the hills east of the town. The only other streams in Ravenswood District are Turkey Run, which flows out of the hills north of Ravenswood, and joins the Ohio River just west of the town; Bar Run, a small creek that flows into the Ohio opposite the southern tip of Lebanon Township, and Cedar Run, which flows northward out of the hills below Flatwoods in Union District, and in its lower course forms part of the boundary between Union and Ravenswood Districts; Stedman Run and Pole Run, both in Ravenswood District, are tributaries of Cedar Run. =Communities= The city of Ravenswood is the only incorporated settlement in the district, and together with Ripley, one of only two in Jackson County. It is the largest city in Jackson County, and with a population estimated at 3,668 in 2018,United States Census Bureau, \\"Population and Housing Unit Estimates\\", Ravenswood city, West Virginia (retrieved 2 Nov. 2019). the largest city in on the Ohio River between Huntington and Parkersburg. The town was laid out in 1836 by the heirs of George Washington, who had surveyed and patented the land before the Revolution,\\"Ravenswood\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County. and has consistently been the most populous town in the county since West Virginia achieved statehood in 1863, except for 1950, when it was briefly surpassed by Ripley.United States Census Bureau, \\"U.S. Decennial Census\\", 1870‚Äì2010. Although there are no other incorporated towns in Ravenswood District, there are a number of unincorporated communities, spread out along the various branches of Sandy Creek. Along the main course, below the forks of Sandy, are Silverton, Nuzums, Varner, and The Y. Wilding is located at the headwaters of the Straight Fork, while Crow Summit lies on Beatty Run. Ascending the Right Fork of Sandy Creek are Murray, Jones Crossing, Meadowdale, Duncan, Le Roy, and Liverpool. Sandyville lies a short distance above the mouth of the Left Fork of Sandy, with New Era nearby at the mouth of the Copper Fork; Independence is nestled in a hollow on the south side of Copper Fork. Further up the Left Fork are Odaville and Drift Run. Garfield is on the county line, above the headwaters of the Turkey Fork. =Roads and transportation= The main road along the Ohio River in Ravenswood District is divided between West Virginia Route 2, coming north from Point Pleasant to Ravenswood, and West Virginia Route 68, continuing northward to Parkersburg. A second north-to-south route, County Road 21, known locally as \\"Parkersburg Road\\", travels through the center of the district, running from Sandyville north to Parkersburg, following the Left Fork of Sandy Creek, and southward to Ripley. The main east-west road begins as U.S. Route 33, coming from Ohio and crossing the river at Ravenswood; there it joins West Virginia 2, and continues to Silverton, where it meets Interstate 77. The road then continues eastward as \\"Old West Virginia 56\\", which joins the Parkersburg Road just south of Sandyville. From Sandyville, Liverpool Road follows the course of the Right Fork of Sandy to Liverpool, and thence into Roane County, continuing to Reedy. County Road 7, known locally as \\"Turkey Fork Road\\", follows the course of the Turkey Fork from the Parkersburg Road to Garfield, and continues to Peewee and Palestine in Wirt County. Interstate 77 runs north and south through the eastern part of the district; however, the only interchange is at Silverton. A railroad runs along the Ohio River between Point Pleasant and Parkersburg, passing through Ravenswood along the way. Formerly part of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, it is now owned by CSX Transportation. The U.S. Route 33 bridge that crosses the river at Ravenswood is the only River crossing in the county, and the only bridge over the Ohio between Mason City and the U.S. Route 50 bridge near Parkersburg. Until the twentieth century, a ferry carried passengers across the river at Ravenswood. History The Ohio river bottom at Ravenswood was first surveyed by George Washington and William Crawford in 1772. The following year, Washington patented a tract of 1,450 acres, including the future site of the town, but the Revolution and threat of Indian warfare forestalled settlement of the area for the remainder of the eighteenth century. The first European settlers in Ravenswood District arrived about 1808, when most of Jackson County was still part of Mason and Wood Counties. The site of Ravenswood and the westward portion of the district lay in Mason County, south of the line dividing Mason from Wood. The first cabin was built at the mouth of Sandy Creek by John Nesselrode, while Lawrence Lane, who arrived about the same time, built the first cabin on the north side of the creek, where the town of Ravenswood was later founded. Other pioneers of the district included William Anderson, who settled about two miles south of Sandy Creek; Eli Gandee, who settled on Sandy Creek about three miles above its mouth; James Daugherty, who settled on the river bottom near Ravenswood, and James Stanley, who settled just below the mouth of Sandy Creek. In 1820, Daniel Beatty became the district's first schoolmaster, teaching from a log cabin built on Sandy Creek two years earlier. Numerous other settlers joined these during the early decades of the nineteenth century. Lawrence Lane and William Bailey cleared forty acres at the future site of Ravenswood in 1810, hoping to establish a claim to the land, which had hitherto gone undeveloped. However, in 1812 the Washington heirs had them ejected, and had the land resurveyed and subdivided. For a number of years the lots were rented to various settlers, including Bartholomew Fleming, who established a ferry across the Ohio River by 1831, the same year that Jackson County was formed from portions of Mason, Wood, and Kanawha Counties. For many years, Fleming sold cord wood to steamboats on the Ohio River; he would later be one of the first merchants of the town of Ravenswood, and the first municipal elections were held at his house. The district's first post office was established at the site of Ravenswood in 1833, under the name of \\"Sandy\\"; Warren Reed was the first postmaster.United States Post Office Department, Record of Appointment of Postmasters, 1832‚Äì1971, NARA Microfilm Publication M841, Virginia, Fluvanna‚ÄìJefferson Counties, p. 95. In 1836, two of the Washington heirs, Henrietta Harning Fitzhugh and Lucy Fitzhugh Payne, moved to the area with their families, and began laying out lots for the site of a town. Payne intended for the town to be named \\"Ravensworth\\", but due to an engraving error in the map, it became known as \\"Ravenswood\\" instead. In 1837, Henry Fitzhugh, the husband of Henrietta Fitzhugh, built the district's first sawmill in 1837; the following year, he built the district's first grist mill as an addition to the sawmill. On July 31, 1863, shortly after West Virginia was admitted to the Union, the West Virginia Legislature passed an act requiring the division of the counties into civil townships. Section five of the bill appointed George L. Kennedy, John Johnson, Robert R. Riley, Abraham Slaughter, and George Click to establish Jackson County's townships. Gilmore, as the district was named until 1871, was one of the five original townships of Jackson County. The original purpose of the townships was to provide for local government, as well as local control over revenue and the newly-created system of free public schools. However, the rural nature of the state proved an impediment to participation in township government, and revenues fell far below expectations. In 1872, the townships were converted into magisterial districts, serving various administrative purposes, but having no governmental function.Otis K. Rice & Stephen W. Brown, West Virginia: A History, 2nd ed., University Press of Kentucky, Lexington (1993), p. 240. The names and boundaries of Jackson County's magisterial districts remained relatively unchanged from 1872 until the 1990s, when the county was redistricted in order to equalize the area and population of its magisterial districts as nearly as possible. Most of Ravenswood District was combined with Grant District to form the new Northern Magisterial District; the southwestern part of the district, south of Ravenswood, was combined with Union District and the western part of Ripley District, excluding the town of Ripley, to form the Western Magisterial District. However, redistricting in a number of counties created confusion with land and tax records, so the legislature provided for the establishment of tax districts, following the lines of the historic magisterial districts, and serving all administrative functions other than the apportionment of county officials. As a result, Ravenswood District remains an administrative unit of Jackson County, although it is no longer one of the magisterial districts.

The incident came in the wake of increased Soviet submarine activity in the Baltic Sea, with Sweden alleging that the Soviet Union had violated Sweden's territorial waters several times from 1974 ‚Äì 1981. The incident, which led to a parliamentary investigation in Sweden, resulted in increased tensions between Sweden and the Soviet Union, and the claimed intrusion of a Soviet submarine remains a contested topic.  History  = Background = Following the development of the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union, the government of Sweden adopted a stance of armed neutrality, seeking to avoid being pulled into the direct influence of either superpower. Despite this adherence to neutrality, the vast majority of Sweden's military efforts were focused on defending against armed aggression by the Soviet Union. To this end, Sweden maintained a sizable navy, and was concerned with interdicting any foreign forces that violated Swedish territorial waters in the Baltic Sea. From 1974 to 1981, a series of incidents occurred in which the Swedish Navy claimed to have detected foreign submarines near or inside Swedish territorial waters. Most notably, in 1981 an incident occurred in which Soviet submarine S-363 became grounded 10 kilometers off the coast of Karlskrona naval base; further inflaming tensions was the fact that the grounded submarine was well within Swedish territorial waters and possibly armed with nuclear weapons. The incident in 1981 led to heightened Swedish fears of Soviet infiltration of Swedish waters, a concern which was reflected in the Swedish navy's actions during the H√•rsfj√§rden incident. = The incident = In 1982, the Swedish government planned to conduct an anti-submarine warfare exercise to test the nation's ability to detect and destroy foreign submarines. This exercise was planned for September 1982, and coincided with NATO exercises in the Baltic. The complete purpose of the Swedish exercise (termed Operation NOTVARP) remains a matter of debate; some sources speculate the operation was a standard military exercise modified to respond to a false alarm, while others posit the operation was either a pre-planned attempt to entrap a foreign submarine (using unknowing American warships calling in Stockholm as bait) or an opportunistic attempt to engage a trespassing submarine. During this same time, the Swedish parliament (having been reshuffled after a series of elections) was in a state of flux, effectively leaving the nation without a government from late September to early October. On the morning of 30 September, Swedish naval units detected an unknown foreign submarine entering H√•rsfj√§rden Bay, where the Swedish Navy had established a hydrophone network and placed naval mines to interdict an intruding submarine. The detection of the submarine caused the Swedish Navy to scramble its forces, though disagreements on how the navy should proceed with the submarine situation delayed an armed response to the intrusion. Once a decision was reached, Swedish forces began to hunt for the submarine; between 1 October and 14 October, numerous sonar contacts and purported sightings (including the detection of an oil slick) prompted the Swedish Navy to drop depth charges, deploy minesweepers, order increased naval patrols, and attempt to seal off H√•rsfj√§rden Bay with a series of metal barriers. The last report of the suspect submarine dates to 14 October, though the search would continue in some capacity until 1 November.Sadurska, Roma (1984).

URL: https://www.kkrva.se/wp- content/uploads/Artiklar/103/kkrvaht_3_2010_6.pdf  Identity of the intruder  At the time of the incident, most sources indicated that the intruding submarine was from the Soviet Union‚Äîthis general consensus has continued to the present day. Most sources cite the previous Soviet infiltrations, the length of the search, the acoustic profile of the intruder (garnered from the few sonar pings detected during the incident) matching a diesel-powered submarine, and the former Soviet Navy's (and later Russian Navy's) culture of secrecy and inconsistent record keeping at the time of the incident as evidence of the intruder being a Soviet submarine.Amick, Aaron. The H√•rsfj√§rden Incident of October 1982: A Submarine is caught in Sweden's ASW trap south of Stockholm. Lecture. 8 October 2019. Other sources have speculated the submarine was present in Sweden during late September in order to track several American warships that were docked in Stockholm and to test the resolve of the-then newly-elected Swedish parliament. In the years after the incident, other sources have theorized that the submarine was from a NATO nation (likely the United States or Great Britain). Swedish professor Ola Tunander posited that a NATO submarine (either serving as an escort for American ships docked in Stockholm or attempting to test the effectiveness of Swedish anti-submarine defenses) had inadvertently found itself trapped in a Swedish defensive system and been attacked; Tunander cited descriptions of the submarine's periscope, the secretive nature of Swedish government documentation of the event, and reports of green water (British and American submarines used green-colored chemical dyes for emergency signaling) being seen near one of the submarine's suspected locations. Other sources speculate that the incident was sparked not by a submarine, but by a series of Swedish surface ships that had inadvertently triggered the navy's anti-submarine measures. = Aftermath = In the aftermath of the H√•rsfj√§rden incident, the Swedish Parliament conducted an investigation into the event and the Swedish Navy's state of preparedness. The incident led to increased Swedish military awareness, and the event has been cited as an example of how the emergency policies of nations can be tested during unexpected international incidents.

Like many patent medicines, it was advertised as a unique cure-all, but mostly contained common ingredients such as turpentine and camphor oil. Development Dr. Thomas' Eclectric Oil was created by a Dr. Samuel N. Thomas of Phelps, New York. Although it was not uncommon to name patent remedies after fabricated characters, especially doctors, contemporary directories do list a so-called \\"electric physician\\" named Samuel N. Thomas living in Phelps from approximately 1867 to 1870. The word \\"Eclectric\\" is likely a portmanteau of the words \\"electric\\" and \\"eclectic\\", alluding to a then-popular belief that electricity had curative powers. Referencing scientific-sounding concepts in product branding in this manner was a common tactic in patent medicine marketing. Dr. Thomas' Eclectric Oil became a staple in many households within the United States as well as Canada. In the United States, the medicine was sold through the Foster-Milburn company based out of Buffalo, New York. In Canada, the primary distributor was through Northrop & Lyman based in Toronto. A partnership was organized between these two companies in 1876, and often acquired products through small proprietors, including Dr. Thomas‚Äô Eclectric Oil. The name of the product was changed several times due to changes in ownership. When Foster- Milburn purchased the medicine in 1880 or 1884, the name was changed to Excelsior Eclectric Oil. In 1906, the name had to be changed to Dr. Thomas‚Äô Eclectic Oil due to the Pure Food and Drug Act which required that sellers must not have misleading information on product labels. In this case, the name was changed because electricity was not a component of the remedy.  Ownership  The first person to own and begin production of Eclectric Oil was Doctor S.N. Thomas in the 1840s. His formula was extremely popular amongst buyers when he sold it to the Excelsior Botanical Company in the 1870s. They renamed the product Excelsior Eclectric Oil while they were marketing it. Northrop & Lyman brought the marketing of the product to Canada in 1871, where they were able to make the product and sell it with their own name in Canada. Between 1880-1884, Foster, Milburn & Co. bought the product from Excelsior Eclectric Oil and renamed it back to Dr. S.N. Thomas‚Äô Eclectic Oil when they began marketing it. It was around this time that the product started being distributed nationally and internationally. A trade card began being distributed by James H.S. Aumann between 1940-1975. This card had a woman wearing Victorian clothes on the front.  Advertising  Many different forms of advertisements were created for this \\"cure-all\\" medicine. The majority of these ads could be found in Northrop & Lyman almanacs and Victorian trading cards, as well as some newspapers such as the Holland City News. Many of the Victorian trading cards, which were likely used up until 1901, portray young women in elegant dresses as well as frogs and cats. The slogan for the medicine appears to be the phrase \\"worth its weight in gold\\", which is portrayed on several of the advertisements. The popularity of Dr. Thomas's Eclectric Oil is also believed to have been spread by commercial travellers working for the company who would encourage druggists and consumers to purchase the product.  Ingredients and uses  Eclectric oil was advertised as an over the counter \\"cure all\\" medicine, containing common ingredients that are still used in many alternative medical remedies performed at home. This oil was a \\"DIY\\" for many common ailments. While the name suggests the uses of electricity and magnetic forces, leading consumers to believe it to be the new modern medicine, the ingredients in this oil were and still are fairly common. The composition of the oil contained main ingredients such as spirits of turpentine, camphor oil (commonly found in many brands of vapor rub), as well as Eucalyptus, Thyme and a variety of fish oils. (Doctor Thomas' Eclectric Oil. (2018, April 10). Some sources suggest other ingredients as well but the general formula is written on the back of the Eclectric bottle. A recipe said to be similar to Thomas's was published in \\"Fenner's complete formulary\\" (1889), with ingredients listed as Camphor, ¬Ω oz.; Oil Gaultheria, ¬Ω oz.; Oil Origanum, ¬Ω oz.; Chloroform, 1 oz.; Laudanum, 1 oz.; Oil Sassafras, 1 oz.; Oil Hemlock, 1 oz.; Oil Turpentine, 1 oz.; Balsam fir, 1 oz.; Tincture Guaiacum, 1 oz.; Tincture Catechu, 1 oz.; Alcohol, 4 pt.; Alkanet, sufficient to color.\\" (Fenner, Byron (1889).Fenner's complete formulary (7th ed.). Westfield, NY. p.1096 Because the ingredients are claimed to be natural, Eclectric oil can be used internally and topically as needed. It claims to cure toothaches, wounds, and any kind of pain within minutes of being applied. The bottle suggests consuming 15 drops to half a teaspoon mixed with sugar for ailments such as coughs and sore throat for deeper pain due to wounds or muscle aches, or saturating the area with the oil and massaging the oil in as needed for external pain.  Bottle  The bottle Foster, Milburn and Co. created for the product was in a rectangular shape with the front indented to list the product name, and the back left plain. The bottle also had flat, sloped corners. One of the shorter sides listed Foster-Milburn's name, while the other listed internal and external uses. Their most recent bottle made before the discontinuation of the product had a similar shape with a paper label. Northrop & Lyman had a bottle shape similar to the early Foster-Milburn bottles with the name and address of the company listed on the label. All four sides of the bottle were eventually embossed.

He is described as a very conservative Hindu ruler whose reign started in 1260. He was known to be disrespectful and intolerant of other faiths practised in Srihatta, such as Islam, Buddhism and certain Hindu denominations, often getting into war with neighbouring states such as Laur, Jaintia and the Khasis. Thus, he is considered to be the most tyrannical leader in Sylheti history. However, he is also noted as one of the strongest rulers in Bengal, and during his reign, Gour was described to be \\"free of enemies\\" due to other states fearing Govinda. After the arrival of Shah Jalal and the Conquest of Sylhet in 1303, Govinda left Gour and the area came under the rule of Wazir Sikandar Khan Ghazi. Background and early life Govinda spent a large proportion of his childhood in Kamakhya Temple and the Kamrup region as a whole, where he was given religious, military and magical education. It is said that Govinda Fenchu had an extraordinary birth. His father was Srinanda, the eldest son of Raja Jayananda who was the king of Brahmachal, or Southern Sylhet. Srinanda suffered from chronic rheumatism and so his younger brother, Upananda, took advantage of this by succeeding his father in the throne with the acceptance of the royal officers. Srinanda protested against this but was unsuccessful. He migrated to Kamrup where he became a sannyasi of Kamakhya Temple, leaving behind his wife and son, Govinda. It is said that here, Srinanda gained a better reputation and was even considered by some to be God of the Sea or Pura Raja. Srinanda's wife, Anna Purna was the mother of Govinda Fenchu. Anna was also said to have been a neglected wife of Raja Gai Gobind of the Jaintia Kingdom. A conflict rose between Govinda's uncle, Raja Upananda of Brahmachal, and Govinda's other uncle, Raja Govardhan of Gour, or Northern Sylhet. Govardhan's allies, the Kukis, raided Upananda's palace in the dead of the night and massacred its inmates. However, Govinda's mother, Anna Purna, was awake and babysitting thirteen royal children, including Govinda, and they all managed to escape to the jungles. They then came across Giridhari, a Bihari sannyasi, who took the children to Kamakhya Temple where they were trained into hermitage. During his time in Kamrup, Govinda was educated in Kamakhya and given military training in the Kulsia ashram on the banks of the Kulsi River (in modern-day Sualkuchi or Kulsi Reserve Forest) for the next twelve years of his life. He learnt a number of skills which he would use during his reign against his enemies such as archery and magic. He studied alongside Hiravati and Achak Narayan, the orphaned children of a dead Jalpaiguri chief and his captive wife, brought to Kamrup by their nurse Mandavi and her son Jhantu. In 1250, Govardhan would successfully defeat Upananda, thus gaining control of Northern and Southern Sylhet. Reign Raja Gour Govinda's Tila (Hill) which contains his fort, still remaining as ruins in Chowhatta. After successfully completing his education, Govinda and his twelve associates were guided by Giridhari back to Sylhet, through Puni beel, in 1260. During this time, Raja Govardhan, the king of Gour, was killed by rebels. Govinda and his accompanying sannyasis went to the temple of Hattanath (tutelary deity of Gour) before launching a surprise attack on the rebels causing them to retreat. Govardhan's wife, Apurna, then thanked the sannyasis and consented for them to rule over Gour as her son, Garuda, who was meant to be Govardhan's heir, was still a minor. Giridhari then informed the royal officers of Govinda's royal lineage, gaining their acceptance, to make his way to the throne. He then changed his name from Govinda Fenchu to Gour Govinda, after his kingdom which he had earned. Govinda appointed Mona Rai as his chief minister, replacing Govardhan's former chief minister Madan Rai. Govinda then married his childhood friend, Hiravati. In one occasion, Hiravati suffered from an illness and no one in Srihatta could help in curing her. Govinda then travelled to Rarh where he met up with a healer by the name of Chakrapani Dutta. The two men then went back to Gour and Dutta was able to cure Hiravati. Govinda, in delight, requested Dutta to live and spend the rest of his life in the Gour Kingdom. However Dutta wanted to return to Rarh. Not wanting to displease Govinda, Dutta gave his youngest son, Mahipati, to live in the kingdom. Dutta stayed for a while in Gour as Govinda's commander-in-chief. The descendants of Mahipati are now known as the Duttas of Lakhai. Govinda also made peace with King Ratan Manikya of Tripura, by gifting an elephant. He did this as a plea for the King to return Brahmachal (Southern Sylhet) back to him from the feudal governor Jaidev Rai, to which the King accepted. After the marriage of Achak Narayan to the eight- year-old princess Lalasa, Govinda gifted Narayan by appointing him as the feudal ruler of Tungachal (modern-day Habiganj District). He built forts all over his kingdom and established many military training camps with Takerghat as his naval headquarters. Govinda's army was noted as Bengal's first army which practised the skillful art of archery. He is famously known to have built a seven-storey brick tower in Penchagor which acted as his palace. The ground floor was given to his army, the first to the commander-in-chief Chakrapani Dutta, the second to Mona Rai, the third to the cabinet, and the rest for himself. The palace which was used by the past chief ministers of Gour was given by Govinda to Mona Rai. The new palace in Penchagor, named Gorduar, also remains as ruins today in Mazumdari Mahalla, Ambarkhana Bazar. It was known to his people that he practised magic which he had learnt in the mountains of Kamrup which was in close proximity to his temple. His military strategy and past victories led to him being very arrogant and boastful of his power. It is said that he would fight lions with swords. There were occasions in which he would go into war with the neighbouring petty kingdoms of Srihatta such as Laur and Jaintia. During a war with the Khasis, Govinda tied the Khasi Raja to ropes, bringing him to Gour. Govinda demanded a ransom for the release of the Khasi king which was later paid. Using Puni beel as a battlefield, Govinda was said to have \\"drowned his challengers\\". The Gour Kingdom during his reign became so powerful to such an extent that it was described to be \\"free of enemies\\". Govinda would carry on the tradition of using stones (shila) to guard the capital; from which the name of Shilhot came into existence. Govinda's kingdom bordered Bengal to the west which was ruled by the Muslim Balban dynasty. The Muslim rule led to large numbers of Bengali Hindus to migrate to Gour, which was considered a Hindu stronghold. Govinda encouraged celebrations such as Vishnu-Sankranti, Shiva-Chaturdashi- Mahashtami, Janmashtami and Utthana-Ekadashi. He also held a 45-day celebration in spring. Brahmins from the Deccan (possibly Deshastha Brahmins), also migrated to Gour and gained some authority, being favoured by Govinda for their orthodoxism. These elitist Brahmins led a movement against members of other religions in Gour. They favoured the Brahmins of Brahmachal brought over by Brahmajit. The followers of Tantric Buddhism were treated as dalits, or untouchables of the lowest social status. The Brahmins which King Kesava Deva had welcomed from Central India, were looked down upon by the Deccan Brahmins as low-class as well, in addition to the Hindu Namasudras, Kaivartas and Dasas who were viewed as poor wine-sellers and fishermen who were influenced too much by Buddhism.  Defeat  Mulnicherra, now the oldest tea garden in South Asia, is home to the Harong Hurong cave which Govinda supposedly retreated to. There was also a minority of Muslim families who migrated to Gour and Tungachal, following the short-lived Azmardan Expedition in 1254 led by the Governor of Bengal, Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Iuzbak. Burhanuddin, who lived in the village of Tultikar, sacrificed a cow for his newborn son's aqiqah or celebration of birth. Govinda, in a fury for what he saw as sacrilege due to his Hindu beliefs, had the newborn, Gulzar Alam, killed, as well as having Burhanuddin's right hand cut off.EB, Suharwardy Yemani Sylheti, Shaikhul Mashaikh Hazrat Makhdum Ghazi Shaikh Jalaluddin Mujjarad, in Hanif, N. \\"Biographical Encyclopaedia of Sufis: Central Asia and Middle East. Vol. 2\\". Sarup & Sons, 2002. p.459 Shortly after this incident, Qazi Nuruddin of Taraf, a rich cultivator, celebrated his son's marriage ceremony of his son by slaughtering a cow for them to eat. After Nuruddin was expelled from the kingdom, Burhanuddin and Nuruddin's brother, Halimuddin, travelled to lower Bengal where they addressed their issued with Sultan Shamsuddin Firoz Shah of Lakhnauti. This initiated the Muslim Conquest of Gour, consisting of two unsuccessful expeditions led by Syed Nasiruddin and Sikandar Khan Ghazi respectively. Govinda's massive war boats looked as if they were floating forts on the water according to Gulzar-i-Abrar, a Muslim account of the war. Govinda's family rejoiced and his aunt Apurna, the queen-mother and wife of the deceased Raja Govardhan, celebrated building a large 20-acre water tank in Bara Bazar, Ambarkhana which was known as Rajar Mar Dighi. Govinda's defeat was in the third battle by the joint force of Sultan's commander-in-chief Sikandar Khan Ghazi's army as well as Shah Jalal and his companions. After hearing that his commander Mona Rai was killed, he escaped with his family to Harong Hurong cave in Mulnicherra. He then went to the shrine of Grivakali, where he left his aunt, Apurna, and his cousin Garuda and cousin-in-law Shanti in the care of the priest. Following this, he took his wife, Hiravati, and son, Nirvana, with him to Kamrup. Garuda and his family, taking shelter at Grivakali shrine, then decided to head off to Tungachal. However, they were seen by Subid, a rebel of Govardhan, who informed the Muslims leading to Garuda's boat being followed by the Muslims. Out of embarrassment, Garuda committed suicide, jumping off the boat at Puni beel. The boatmen, however, continued taking Garuda's mother and wife to Tungachal, eventually finding refuge with Raja Achak Narayan. They made a vow in Tunganath Shiva temple to fast for ninety days, hoping for safety. Tungachal was eventually conquered subsequently to Gour in the Conquest of Taraf. - References Category:Rulers of Sylhet Category:14th-century Indian monarchs Category:History of Hinduism ","title":"Gour Govinda"},{"id":"62218584","text":"Chaleuria is a genus of extinct plants, found as fossils in New Brunswick, Canada.

In 1987, on the basis of her articles, books and photographs promoting international understanding and improvements to the status of women, she was awarded the UNESCO Prize for Peace Education. Deonna, who continues to write, has published 12 widely translated books. Biography Born in 1937 in Geneva, Laurence Deonna is the daughter of the economist and politician Raymond Deonna who headed the board of the former Journal de Gen√®ve and his wife Anne-Marie Vernet-Faesch. She left school before matricularing, attended art school in London and returned to Geneva to work in an art gallery. She was married for a short period between 1961 and 1963. In 1967, invited to report on the Six-Day War, she embarked on a long career as a journalist in the Middle-East, where she took a special interest in the lives of Arab women. Realizing that books offered a more lasting way than newspapers of covering countries in depth, she went on to publish many lengthy accounts of her trips abroad over the next 40 years. They were frequently illustrated with her photographs. Her works not only focus on women but reveal her firm conviction that many of the world's problems could be solved if greater concern was devoted to achieving peace. As a result, in 1989 she was awarded the UNESCO Prize for Peace Education. In Switzerland, she was a strong proponent of the 1989 (unsuccessful) referendum to abolish the Swiss army. Her role as a feminist can be seen from the central place she gives to women in all her writings.

It was the first faculty of electrical engineering in the world and offered the first course of study in electrical engineering. As of 2018, the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology is one of the largest electrical engineering departments in Germany, with 29 professorships, around 250 scientific staff and around 2,400 students in 10 study courses. The history of the department is shaped by pioneers. Among the well-known graduates are for example John Tu, Kurt Heinrich Debus and Gerhard M. Sessler.  History  180x180pxIn 1882, the electrical engineering pioneer and physicist Erasmus Kittler was appointed to the world's first chair of electrical engineering. One year later, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering was founded at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt and the world's first degree course in electrical engineering was offered. Among Kittler's first students were Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky, the inventor of three-phase electric power and three-phase motor, which lead to the Second Industrial Revolution, and Carl Hering, known for Hering's experiment.Grabinski, H.. (1997). Hering's experiment: Myths and facts. Electrical Engineering - ELECTR ENG. 80. 285-290. In 1899, the Electrotechnical Association was founded at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. Many companies emerged from this association. John F. Kennedy Space Centeralt=240x240px In 1907, Rudolf Goldschmidt developed the Goldschmidt alternator, which enabled the first radio transmission line between the USA and Germany. Later, he invented several inventions together with Albert Einstein, including hearing aids and loudspeakers. They received the patent for the construction of a loudspeaker in 1933. After Kittler retired from teaching in 1914, the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt awarded him an honorary doctorate and appointed Waldemar Petersen as his successor. Peterson established high voltage technology and invented a compensator for residual current in case of unintentional earth faults of an outer conductor, which is exhibited in the German Museum in Munich today. Later he became Director of AEG. In 1930, Hans Busch was appointed professor at the newly established Institute of Communications Engineering. He founded modern electron optics, thus laying the foundations for the electron microscope. Under the Nazi regime, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt were brought into line with the National Socialist dictatorship from 1933 to 1945. Under the impressions of the Bombing of Darmstadt in World War II one year later, the first International Conference on Engineering Education was held at TU Darmstadt, at which all participants in research and teaching committed themselves solely to peaceful purposes. In 1952, Karl K√ºpfm√ºller was appointed. He founded the system theory of electrical message transmission and thus made a significant contribution to the development of long-distance telephone traffic. In 1924 he established a relationship between the bandwidth and the duration of oscillation of signals, which later became known as K√ºpfm√ºller's uncertainty principle. From 1962 until 1974, Kurt H. Debus was the first director of the John F. Kennedy Space Center. During this time he was responsible for the launch of the Apollo program including the six moon landings Apollo 11 to Apollo 17. Apollo 13 was aborted prematurely. Under his leadership the following missions were accomplished: 1961 Alan Shepard, first American in space, 1962 John Glenn, first American to orbit the Earth, 1969 Neil Armstrong, first man on the moon and 1973 launch of the Skylab space laboratory.SA-1)alt=563x563px 180x180pxRobert Piloty, who was appointed to the field of message processing in 1964, had an great influence on the development of data technology and the establishment of computer science as an independent discipline. In 1968, Robert Piloty and Winfried Oppelt initiated the first computer science course in Germany at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering. In 1969, graduates of TH Darmstadt founded Software AG. Today it is one of the largest IT companies in Europe. Among the founders were Peter Pag√©, electrical engineering graduate, and Peter Schnell, graduate of mathematics and physics. Schnell was chairman of Software AG for many years and today, with his Software AG Foundation, is one of the largest donors in Germany. One year later, billionaire John Tu completed his electrical engineering studies. He later founded Kingston Technology. In 1971, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering was divided into three departments: Electrical Power Engineering, Communications Engineering and Control and Data Engineering. In 1975, Gerhard Sessler, the developer of the foil electret microphone, was appointed to the Chair of Electroacoustics. He developed the silicon microphone at the department in 1983. Gerhard Sessler is included in the National Hall of Fame of the USA and received the Benjamin Franklin Medal in 2010. In 1990, 1991 and 1992 the electric vehicle \\"Pinky\\" developed at TU Darmstadt won the Tour de Sol, the world championship for solar vehicles. Pinky is exhibited in the German Museum in Munich. The working group later developed into the Academic Solar Technology Group Akasol. Many companies came from Akasol, including the company of the same name Akasol AG. In 1996, the first chair for renewable energies in Germany was established at the university and is occupied by Thomas Hartkopf. Hartkopf and his team developed the energy systems of the solar houses, that won the Solar Decathlon in 2007 and 2009. In 1998, Werner Langheinrich and Ottmar Kindl developed the technology for cameras in the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). One year later, M. Anders, Egon Christian Andresen and Andreas Binder developed the linear power train of the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). In 2003, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology awarded Rolf Isermann, professor at TU Darmstadt, to the Top Ten of Emerging Technologies because his developments will have an enduring effect on the world. In 2013, Germany's first chair for bio-inspired communication systems was established at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology and in 2017, the medical engineering course was established in cooperation with the Department of Medicine of the Goethe University Frankfurt.  Research  The research profile of the etit department covers established research areas such as automation technology, microwave technology, communications technology, theoretical electrical engineering, data technology, microelectronics and electrical power engineering. In addition, there are three main areas of research in the department: = Mechatronics, Automation & Sensors = The research focus is concerned with the investigation of the control of technical processes, the characterization and application of mechatronic systems and the necessary sensor technology for the acquisition of physical quantities.

Plot Psychiatrist Dr. Gao Jing is scuba diving with a group of environmentalists attempting to bury carbon dioxide in the seabed when she is photographed by Guo Dong, the brother of her patient Xiao Kai. The photographs are shown in an exhibition and the two begin dating. Guo Dong takes Gao Jing to the Ryukyu Islands to show her the ancient underwater city of Yonaguni where he has hidden a ring that he will use to propose to his true love, but is beheaded in a mysterious accident. Xiao Kai does not believe that the body at the funeral is her brother's because there is no head and the fingerprints have worn off. She believes that her brother may still be alive and begins searching for him. She searches a shipwreck site with Guo Dong's friend Haiya Amu and finds a white-haired severed head that she believes to be her brother's. Dr. Gao has lost her memory of the events and does not know what happened to her boyfriend. Dr. Gao convinces her boss Dr. Tang to give her hypnotism therapy and drugs to recover her memory. The drugs cause her to develop a sensitivity to bright lights and loud noises. She notices the same sensitivity in her patient Simon, who says he has seen the dripping wet ghost of Guo Dong. Dr. Gao asks Simon to help her contact Guo Dong but warns her that she is being pursued by the white-haired ghost. Dr. Gao returns home to finds Xiao Kai speaking with a different accent and suspects that she is channeling the ghost of Su Zhenjing, a 24-year-old girl from Hualien. Xiao Kai asks Dr. Gao to open the canister containing the recovered head but Simon calls and warns her not to do it. Later he is severely injured when he is run over by Xiao Kai and ends up in the hospital. Dr. Gao sends Haiya Amu to check whose head is in the canister but when she returns home she finds him dead with a knife in his back. Dr. Gao throws the severed head off her balcony and is attacked by Xiao Kai, who is stopped by the police. Dr. Gao takes more of the drugs to communicate with the ghost of Guo Dong, who saves her when she almost falls down the stairs. Guo Dong's ghost explains that his oxygen tank was smashed by currents and Dr. Gao invites him to stay with her. Dr. Gao returns Haiya Amu's head to her father and has a final conversation with Guo Dong. Dr. Gao wakes up in a hospital, where she has been ever since her boyfriend's disappearance. She has no memory of the disappearance. Xiao Kai recounts how Guo Dong disappeared after saving Dr. Gao from nitrogen narcosis. A camcorder video reveals that Dr. Gao stabbed Guo Dong during her narcosis. Xiao Kai brings Dr. Gao home and cares for her. Dr. Gao dreams that Guo Done asks her to travel to Feng Lai to find him. Dr. Gao finds the tape but the stabbing has been erased. Dr. Gao travels to Feng Lai and finds Guo Dong's cabin and lost photographs. On the beach she finds the ring he meant to give her, then she walks into the ocean. In the final scene the ghosts of Gao Jin and Guo Dong are shown swimming together around the underwater city of Yonaguni.

It was founded in 2004 by an Australian couple, travel writer Stuart McDonald and journalist Samantha Brown, and operates out of Sydney. The website carries guidebook-style recommendations written by its staff and paid contributors, and is recognized as a major online travel resource for the region. History McDonald first travelled to Thailand in 1993, and repeatedly visited the region in the following years, during which he worked in Australia and self-published guidebooks to Vietnam and Thailand. He met Brown in 1997, and after travelling around Southeast Asia, the couple decided to settle in Thailand in 1998 (they have since also lived in Phnom Penh and Jakarta, before settling in Bali). McDonald taught himself web development while working in Bangkok, and, as Brown had experience as a writer and editor, they came up with the idea of an online travel guide. In 2003, McDonald borrowed AU$5,000 from his parents to fund the project, and they launched the website in 2004. The website originally featured a few locations in Thailand, but gradually expanded to cover Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Singapore by 2008, and later Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar (though it suspended its Myanmar coverage in 2018, in response to the Rohingya crisis and the sentencing of Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo). Initially catering to backpackers, its coverage later expanded to include a wide range of independent travel styles, and now includes over 8,000 reviews of accommodation options. Travelfish has seen recommendations from writers for The Telegraph, The Sunday Times, The Guardian, Business Insider, and News.com.au. The New York Times travel writer Freda Moon has called it \\"the indispensable Southeast Asia travel guide\\". Operations Travelfish Pty Ltd was registered in 2009, and is headquartered in suburban Sydney, though it maintains \\"research hubs\\" in several Southeast Asian cities. McDonald codes for and maintains the website, while Brown serves as editor-in-chief and oversees marketing. Reviews are also contributed by field researchers, who at one time comprised up to seventeen regular freelancers, though the site has since shifted toward employing several full- time staff instead. The site has policies of only doing in-person reviews and not accepting compensation from property owners. The site has gone through several methods of generating revenue. As of 2019, it carries online advertising and affiliate links (including a partnership with hotel-booking website Agoda), offers travel-planning assistance, and has a paid membership program. The subscription, introduced in 2016, includes access to downloadable PDF guides (which were previously sold individually), exclusive content (a paywall was introduced in 2018), as well as certain discounts and services. The site, which operates more like a traditional guidebook, has faced difficulties as readership shifted away towards those featuring user-generated content. In 2019, the site experienced a sharp drop in traffic following Google's redesigning of its search interface to heavily feature its own travel portal, a change McDonald criticized as unfair.

Plot Following a stint with the yakuza, a fisherman's son named Jiro returns home to his fishing village to find the boats and equipment destroyed by Gen Ashida, son of the boss of the Ashida clan, and his men as punishment for the Yamagata family working together with other fishing families. Jiro's mother does not want a yakuza staying in their village and his childhood friend Reiko explains that his father was killed. His brother Toshio confides that their father Jiro had forgiven Jiro for abandoning the village, whereupon Jiro decides to seek vengeance. Jiro fights his way into Ashida headquarters to confront the boss Ashida himself but Gen catches him whips him as punishment. Jiro's wounds are treated by his neighbors Some and Oritsu while Jiro keeps his true plans for revenge secret from his mother, claiming that he got into a drunken brawl. Reiko's father Aida, now boss of the fishermen, is told by men from the Ashida clan that they are lowering their payments for fish, even though the village is not allowed to sell to anyone else. Jiro's youngest brother Shinkichi and another young fisherman named Toshi offer to help Jiro kill Ashida. One night the fishermen waste their money on a gambling operation run by Gen's bodyguard Kumai Go but Jiro joins and wins their money back for them. The next day Kumai attempts to win his money back from Jiro but Jiro continues to beat him and uses his winnings to buy information from Kumai about the strength of the Ashida clan, learning that their only weapon is the rifle owned by Gen. During a festival, Shinkichi and Toshi steal fireworks and use them to attack Ashida but Shinkichi is shot by Gen and washes up on the shore to die in Jiro's arms. Ashida dumps the village's caught fish back into the water in order to inflate prices and refuses to let them go out fishing again, claiming that they would not catch enough to pay for the boats' fuel. Aida is beaten when he resists and Ashida wonders if they should kill Jiro to scare others away from joining forces with the Yamagata family. Gen suggests using Kumai to do it, since he doesn't mind if Kumai gets killed. Instead of sneaking up on Jiro, Kumai presents himself and challenges Jiro to a fair fight. Out of anger, Gen shoots Kumai's dog Koro to death, then shoots Kumai in the arm, preventing their duel from occurring. Jiro returns to the village and finds that Ashida's men have set it on fire but manages to rescue his mother from their burning home that she has run into in order to recover the memorials to her husband and son. Finally at their breaking point, the various families of fishermen join forces with Jiro to battle the Ashida clan. Jiro instructs them to scatter the hoodlums and take the Ashida fishing boats out to sea to catch fish to sell in their own expanded shops. Kumai tells Jiro that one of Kumai's family members was also killed and that he is switching sides, revealing a large fishing clan tattoo on his back. Ashida's men pursue Jiro's crew of five men to the beach while the other fishermen take the boats out to sea. Jiro's men surprise Ashida's men with Molotov cocktails, then overpower them with swords and pikes. Sensing defeat, Ashida pleads with Gen not to pursue them but Gen rushes in with his rifle. Kumai stops Gen from shooting Jiro and then Gen fatally shoots Kumai before realizing that he has also been fatally stabbed by Kumai. Kumai tells Jiro that he has avenged his dog Koro, then dies. Jiro prepares to kill Ashida but is unable to do it when he sees the distraught father weeping with his dead son in his arms.

The initial cut of the film was banned for its violence, generating public interest in the film that caused its edited version to become a box office success in Hong Kong. Plot Paul manufactures a bomb using a wristwatch for its timer and he and his two friends Lung and Ko set it off in a movie theater for fun, avoiding any casualties. Wan-Chu, a girl who spends her time torturing animals, sees them flee the theater and follows them but does not tell the police. After being fired from her job at a printing press for pouring ink on a coworker during an argument, she argues with her older brother Tan, the police officer assigned to investigate the bombing, and impales a cat on a fence post out of anger. She then forces her way into the group of boys by threatening to expose them to the police if they do not become her friends. She makes them discard a mouse she has tortured and in return they challenge her to place a bomb in a public restroom, which she does without hesitation. When the three boys try to ditch her, Wan-Chu plants a bomb of her own, warning them that the next one will be on their front door so that the police will search their house. Now in control of the group, she forces them to assist her in hijacking a bus full of tourists from an airport, but the bus door closes with only Wan-Chu on it. Threatening to light a bomb she is holding, she forces the guide and the tourists to strip to their underwear, then abandons them at a construction site. She finds the three boys leaving their school and pours gasoline on them. She attempts to burn them but they use one of the burning shirts against her as she flees and is nearly hit by a car, causing an argument with its foreign driver. The boys throw rocks at the car and the man chases them as Wan-Chu steals a package from his car filled with Japanese money orders and accidentally drops a written contract in an alley without noticing. The foreigner, a gun runner named Bruce, is killed with a sword by his boss Nigel for becoming exposed. Paul attempts to exchange one of the money orders at a bank but when the teller takes it to the director Paul gets scared and leaves. The youths threaten an exchange manager, demanding information on how to exchange the money orders, but he gives them a fake address. Now angered, they plant a bomb under his car but only kill his bodyguard, the former Mr. Hong Kong. Based on the survivor's testimony, the police link the attack to Paul's previous attempt to exchange the money order at the bank. Wan-Chu offers a deal to a local gang that previously harassed her and meets their leader, Uncle Hark, who works as a club DJ. Hark takes Wan-Chu and Ko to a banker who agrees to exchange 20 of the money orders into Hong Kong dollars for 30% of their amount, then Hark sends his gang to rob the two youths of the money. Wan-Chu and Ko throw the money down the stairwell to Lung, who gets trapped by the gang members in the parking garage. Lung throws the money and money orders at them and escapes when Paul, Ko and Wan-Chu throw bombs at the gang members. Wan-Chu is furious at Lung for throwing the money away and their argument leads the boys to abandon her again. Now alone, Wan-Chu is caught by Hark and his gang. As they are threatening to burn her, Tan arrives and beats up Hark but Wan-Chu refuses to press charges. Back at their apartment, Tan angrily beats her for fighting with the gang then ties her to the bars on the windows with cable ties. Back at the club, Hark makes his gang give him the money they picked up in the parking garage. A drunk foreigner sees one of the money orders among the currency and tells Nigel. Nigel's gang tortures Hark with piano wire until he tells them about Wan-Chu. Nigel's gang comes to her apartment but then Tan returns home and leads them on a chase. Nigel attempts to carry Wan-Chu away but when she struggles out of his grasp she falls and gets impaled through her head by a fence post where she earlier killed a cat in the same way. The police arrive and collect bullets lodged in the wall but also find the money orders under the mouse cage in the house, causing the chief to take Tan off the case. When Paul's face is shown on TV in connection with the bombings, the three boys pack their backpacks and hide out in a large cemetery crowded with gravestones, arguing among themselves. They later attempt to kill themselves by drinking Dettol. Paul and Lung spit it out but Ko swallows it so Paul runs to a shop to buy milk to dilute the poison and is recognized by the seller. Back in the city, Tan attacks two Mormon missionaries on the street after mistaking them for members of Nigel's gang and is brought into the office to be taken off duty for a few days. While there, he answers the telephone and is told by the milk seller that she has seen Paul at the cemetery. Tan finds Lung running to find a medic for Ko and handcuffs him to a post then chases Paul through the gravestones and catches him. Lung is found by one of Nigel's, who holds him at gunpoint and tells Tan to drop his weapon. Tan shoots the man, who shoots and kills Lung and injures Paul as he falls to his death. Nigel chases Tan down a hill, demanding to know where the contract is, then beats him unconscious. Paul grabs a gun and shoots at a gang member but only ends up shooting Lung more. The gang member hunts him through the cemetery and shoots and kills him in his hiding spot. Ko surprises the man and kills him by bashing his head with a metal pipe, then takes his machine gun and kills Nigel's remaining man. Nigel shoots the car Ko is using to escape then pulls the boy out and beats him. Ko grabs a gun from the ground and shoots Nigel twice but then runs out of bullets. Tan grabs a machine gun from the ground and shoots and kills Nigel. Ko takes the machine gun from Tan and gleefully shoots it into the cemetery as a montage of photographs from the 1967 mayhem in Hong Kong is shown. The film ends with a flashback to one of the boys' more innocent pranks when they dropped a bag of red paint onto a pedestrian.

Tsui Hark used live animals for the scenes of animal torture. The score for the film was taken from various sources including Goblin's soundtrack to George Romero's Dawn of the Dead and Jean-Michel Jarre's Oxyg√®ne. Release and censorship The film was released in Hong Kong under the English title Dangerous Encounter‚Äî1st Kind. It has also been released under the English titles Don't Play with Fire and Playing with Fire. The Hong Kong censor immediately banned the first version of the film for its violent content and forced a restructuring of the film. In the original version, the teenagers make bombs and leave them in public places, a reference to the 1967 rebellion in Hong Kong. In the revised version, the teenagers are merely introduced as hit-and-run drivers. The original ends with a montage of photographs of the mayhem of 1967. The censored version of the film has a runtime of 95 minutes, while the uncut version has a runtime of 100 minutes, though both versions contain unique material (approx. 17 minutes in the original cut, and approx. 13 minutes in the theatrical cut). The publicity generated by the initial banning of the film generated interest in the film, ensuring large audiences for the censored version that was released in Hong Kong theaters. The original uncut version has been released on DVD in France by HK Vid√©o. On this release, the footage that was originally removed from the theatrical version has been sourced from a VHS tape commissioned by director Tsui Hark during production when he was ordered to make changes to the film. The original film elements for this footage are thought to be lost. Reception The film was a success, becoming the 33rd-highest-grossing film at the Hong Kong box office in 1980. Many reviewers have noted the bleak, nihilistic nature of the film. In 1982, Peter Cowie wrote that the film is going \\"heavily for the shock-horror mould at present dominating much contemporary drama\\". In their 2014 book International Noir, Homer B. Petty and R. Barton Palmer cited the work an example of the \\"challenging works of the Hong Kong Noir Wave\\".

These beetles are a well known invasive pest, and are responsible for significant crop damage across many countries. The male to female ratio is between 1:1.26 and 1:1.46. Description =Eggs= Rice hispa eggs laid by the female beetle are usually inserted beneath the epidermis of the underside of leaves. Occasionally, the eggs are also laid on the top side of leaves. The eggs are minute, covered in a dark substance, and laid singly. Each female lays a total of between 18 and 101 eggs in their lifetime, with an average of 55. The incubation period is about four days.Acharya, S. L. P. (1967). Life history bionomics and morphology of rice hispa, Hispa armigera Oliver. Masters Thesis. Retrieved from http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/displaybitstream?handle=1/5810084179 =Larvae= The larvae, on hatching, are ~2.4mm long, dorsoventrally flattened, and pale yellow. They mine into the leaf, feeding on the green tissues and only leaving the two epidermal layers. The activity of the larvae will often leave an irregular discolored pattern on the leaf. Larvae will feed and pupate within the leaf, without needing to migrate to a fresh leaf. A fully grown larvae is ~5.5 mm long, dorsoventrally flattened, and a dull pale yellow. The larval period lasts for 7‚Äì12 days, and is followed by pupation. =Pupae= D. armigera pupae are dorsoventrally flattened, brown, and appropriately 4.9mm long. The pupal stage last for about 4 days. =Adults= Mature imago on a leaf Finally the adult beetle, known as an imago, emerges and cuts its way out of the larval tunnel and surrounding leaf. The imago is ~5mm long, and bluish black with a spiny body. The average longevity of the adult is 24 days for the female, and 16 days for the male, although some individuals have been known to live as long as 90 days. Adults have long, well-developed spines on the prothorax and elytra. Four spines project from the metanotum, and the elytra contains a row of ten spines along lateral margins, and nine dorsolateral spines. Distribution Discladispa armigera is known to be widespread in the following countries: Bangladesh, India, and Laos. Additionally, D. armigera is present, but not wide-spread in: Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Iran, Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Papua New Guinea. Mating behavior The high reproductive potential and short generation time are significant contributors to the success of this species. Adults mate for the first time after 3‚Äì7 days. Mating is a complex and precisely determined process. Precopulatory behavior, including courtship, mounting, and activation of the female last a few seconds to a few minutes. Copulation requires ~1 hour. Postcopulatory behaviors are brief. Human interaction D. armigera are known to cause significant plant damage, targeting crops such as rice, maize, and other grasses. Young plants are more susceptible to damage by the pests. The reduction of D. armigera populations in areas where crops are grown is desirable to increase crop yield. The two primary methods for population control are biological controls which utilize predators of the pest, and chemical controls which utilize insecticides. In some cases manual controls may be used. =Biological control= Several species have been explored as a biological control, including the egg parasitoid wasp Trichigramma zahiri Polaszek, the egg and larval parasitoid Neochrysocharis sp., and the larval and pupal parasitoid Scutibracon hispae. These hymenopteran species are natural parasitoids of the pre-adult stages of D. armigera. The white muscardine fungus (Beauveria bassiana) has also been tested as a biological control of the rice hispa. On adherence to the body surface, the fungal spores germinate and enter into the beetle's haemocoel, where the fungus utilizes the body tissues for food. In field tests, the application of B. bassiana spores was effective in reducing D. armigera populations. Adult rice hispa die 5‚Äì6 days after inoculation, and white mycelial growth was observed over the surface of the insect. Infected adults become adhered to leaf surfaces, and after 7‚Äì10 days the entire surface of the adults is covered by the fungus. Infected eggs have a white powdery mass around it, surrounded by a yellow halo. Infected larvae become thinner, but do not change in length. Infected pupae had white mycelial growth over their body, their size is reduced by half and they become totally deformed. =Chemical control= Multiple biopesticides have been tested on D. armigera. Larvocel, Calpaste, Azacel, Neem oil, Multineem, and dk-bioneem have all been shown to be effective at reducing D. armigera populations by as much as 96%. Conventional pesticides are also effective, reducing D. armigera populations on experimental rice paddies by as much as 100%.

Outstanding features in the soilscape are wide plains with Vertisols.  Factors contributing to soil diversity  = Climate = Annual rainfall depth is very variable with an average of around 600 mm. Most rains fall during the main rainy season, which typically extends from June to September. Mean temperature in woreda town Kwiha is 20 ¬∞C, oscillating between average daily minimum of 11.3 ¬∞C and maximum of 28.4 ¬∞C. The contrasts between day and night air temperatures are much larger than seasonal contrasts. = Geology= From the higher to the lower locations, the following geological formations are present: * Amba Aradam Formation * Agula Shale * Mekelle Dolerite * Antalo Limestone * Quaternary alluvium and freshwater tufa = Topography = As part of the Ethiopian highlands the land has undergone a rapid tectonic uplift, leading the occurrence of mountain peaks, plateaus, valleys and gorges. = Land use = Generally speaking the level lands and intermediate slopes are occupied by cropland, while there is rangeland and shrubs on the steeper slopes. Remnant forests occur around Orthodox Christian churches and a few inaccessible places. A recent trend is the widespread planting of eucalyptus trees. = Environmental changes = Soil degradation in this district became important when humans started deforestation almost 5000 years ago. Depending on land use history, locations have been exposed in varying degrees to such land degradation.  Geomorphic regions and soil units  Typical catena in the gently rolling Antalo limestone plateau Given the complex geology and topography of the district, it has been organised into land systems - areas with specific and unique geomorphic and geological characteristics, characterised by a particular soil distribution along the soil catena. Soil types are classified in line with World Reference Base for Soil Resources and reference made to main characteristics that can be observed in the field. = Gently rolling Antalo Limestone plateau, holding cliffs and valley bottoms = * Associated soil types ** shallow stony soils with a dark surface horizon overlying calcaric material (Calcaric Leptosol) (3) ** moderately deep dark stony clays with good natural fertility (Vertic Cambisol) (10) ** deep, dark cracking clays on calcaric material (Calcaric Vertisol, Calcic Vertisol) (11) * Inclusions ** Rock outcrops and very shallow soils (Lithic Leptosol) (1) ** Shallow very stony loamy soil on limestone (Skeletic Calcaric Cambisol) (5) ** Deep dark cracking clays with very good natural fertility, waterlogged during the wet season (Chromic Vertisol, Pellic Vertisol) (12) ** Brown to dark sands and silt loams on alluvium (Vertic Fluvisol, Eutric Fluvisol, Haplic Fluvisol) (30) = Gently undulating Agula shale plateau with dolerite = Typical catena on the undulating Agula shale plateau with dolerite * Dominant soil type: stony, dark cracking clays with good natural fertility (Vertic Cambisol) (10) * Associated soil types ** rock outcrops, stony and shallow soils (Lithic Leptosol) (1) ** red-brownish loamy soils with good natural fertility (Chromic Luvisol) (20) * Inclusions ** deep, dark cracking clays on calcaric material with good fertility but poor drainage (Vertisol) (11,12) = Mekelle Graben = Typical catena along the Mekelle Fault escarpment * Associated soil types ** moderately deep dark stony clays with good natural fertility (Vertic Cambisol) (10) ** deep, dark cracking clays on calcaric material (Calcaric Vertisol, Calcic Vertisol) (11) ** moderately deep, red-brownish, loamy soils with a good natural fertility (Chromic Luvisol) (20) * Inclusions ** Rock outcrops and very shallow soils on limestone (Calcaric Leptosol) (2) ** Shallow very stony loamy soil on limestone (Skeletic Calcaric Cambisol) (5) = Strongly incised Giba gorge = Typical catena in the severely incised Giba gorge Giba river near Inda Mihtsun * Dominant soil type: complex of rock outcrops, very stony and very shallow soils ((Lithic) Leptosol) (1) * Associated soil types ** shallow, stony, dark, loamy soils on calcaric material (Rendzic Leptosol) (3) ** shallow, stony to sandy loam soils on calcaric material (Calcaric Regosol and Cambisol) (21) ** brown loamy sands developed on alluvium along Giba River (Fluvisol) = Ancient river terraces = Typical catena on ancient river terraces * Associated soil types ** shallow, stony, dark, loamy soils on calcaric material (Rendzic Leptosol) (3) ** Deep, dark cracking clays with good fertility, but problems of waterlogging (Chromic and Pellic Vertisol) (12) ** moderately deep, red-brownish, loamy soils with a good natural fertility (Chromic Luvisol) (20) ** Brown to dark, silty clay loams to loamy sands developed on alluvium, with good natural fertility (Fluvisol) (30) * Inclusions ** complex of rock outcrops, very stony and very shallow soils ((Lithic) Leptosol) (1) ** shallow to very shallow, very stony, loamy soils (Skeletic/Leptic Cambisol and Regosol) (4) ** shallow, dark, stony, loamy soils on calcaric material, rich on organic matter (Calcaric Mollic Cambisol) (23) = Alluvial plains induced by tufa dams = Typical catena on Tufa dam backfill Tufa dam in Chelekwot * Dominant soil type: deep dark cracking clays with very good natural fertility, waterlogged during the wet season (Chromic Vertisol, Pellic Vertisol) (12) * Associated soil type: stony, dark cracking clays with good natural fertility (Vertic Cambisol) (10) * Inclusions ** shallow, stony, dark, loamy soils on calcaric material (Rendzic Leptosol) (3) ** shallow, very stony, silt loamy to loamy soils (Skeletic Cambisol, Leptic Cambisol, Skeletic Regosol) (4)  Soil erosion and conservation  The reduced soil protection by vegetation cover, combined with steep slopes and erosive rainfall has led to excessive soil erosion. Nutrients and organic matter were lost and soil depth was reduced. Hence, soil erosion is an important problem, which results in low crop yields and biomass production. As a response to the strong degradation and thanks to the hard labour of many people in the villages, soil conservation has been carried out on a large scale since the 1980s and especially 1980s; this has curbed rates of soil loss. Measures include the construction of infiltration trenches, stone bunds, check dams, small reservoirs such as Addi Amharay, Arato and Hiza'iti Wedi Cheber as well as a major biological measure: exclosures in order to allow forest regeneration. On the other hand, it remains difficult to convince farmers to carry out measures within the farmland (in situ soil management), such as bed and furrows or zero grazing, as there is a fear for loss of income from the land. Such techniques are however very effective.

Macdonald ordered a Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration to investigate whether restrictions should be imposed upon Chinese people in Canada. Two commissioners were appointed: the Honorable Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau, Doctor of Laws and Secretary of State of Canada; and Honorable John Hamilton Gray, Doctor of Civil Law, Judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia. In Canada, anti-Chinese sentiments were growing in the public sphere and Prime Minister Macdonald could not ignore the discrimination which called for the creation of anti- Chinese policies. The commissioners heard from fifty-one witnesses who submitted their testimonies to twenty-seven questions regarding Chinese in Canada, and what policies should or should not be implemented to restrict them. Each of these witnesses gave their accounts and the commissioners gathered their answers to draw upon for their conclusions. However, a majority of their interviews were concentrated in Victoria rather than in the countryside where Chinese men competed for jobs, and many felt that this lost credibility for the report. Although they did venture to other cities, like Nanaimo and New Westminister, but none of the voices from those cities many it into the final report. They held interviews in some locations in the states as well, notably San Francisco and Portland.  Inquiry Findings  While a majority of the witnesses gave negative testimonials about Chinese immigrants, some individuals were of the opinion that there were upsides to Chinese labor. William Babcock, a resident of San Francisco, gave a overall positive testimonial citing that Chinese labor was cheaper, and that they do not get involved with politics as they are intending to return to their own country after amassing some wealth. As well, in some jobs where there is a high turnover rate for servants, the Chinese labour force are reliable and tend to stay. Of the twenty respondents who believed that Chinese people had helped to develop the province, ten believed that they had a negative impact. Regardless of a positive or negative impact, many who felt the Chinese had impacted provincial development felt that their presence was still needed, except for three people. Each of the commissioners have their own personal reports in the commission. In the Honourable John Gray's personal report titled, \\"Respecting Chinese Immigration in British Columbia\\", he outlines the three distinct categories of public opinions on Chinese immigrants:Chapleau, Joseph-Adolphe, and John Hamilton Gray. 1885. \\"Report of the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration report and evidence.\\" Printed by order of the Commission. . . pp. CII. # \\"Of a well-meaning, but strongly prejudiced minority, whom nothing but absolute exclusion will satisfy. # \\"An intelligent minority, who conceive that no legislation whatever is necessary ‚Äì that, as in all business transactions, the rule of supply and demand will apply and the matter regulate itself in the ordinary course of events.\\" # \\"Of a large majority, who think there should be moderate restriction, based upon police, financial and sanitary principles, sustained and enforced by stringent local regulations for cleanliness and the preservation of health.‚Äù An intelligent minority, who conceive that no legislation whatever is necessary ‚Äì that, as in all business transactions, the rule of supply and demand will apply and the matter regulate itself in the ordinary course of events.Of a large majority, who think there should be moderate restriction, based upon police, financial and sanitary principles, sustained and enforced by stringent local regulations for cleanliness and the preservation of health.‚Äù  Conclusions  Despite anti-Chinese sentiments growing in Canada, Chapleau and Gray did not see Chinese immigration as a hindrance to British Columbia, instead viewing their labor as necessary. They did not suggest the outright exclusion of Chinese immigrants, rather they opted for the consideration of a $10 head tax upon arrival in Canada. With the funds collected from the head taxes, the government could invest in a health inspector to be stationed at the ports of entry to examine the health of those who entered Canada, protecting against the spread of disease. Following the Royal Commission was the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 which looked at the recommendations made by Chapleau and Gray. A head tax of $50 was set, much higher than the $10 suggested in the commission.

It was raised as a duplicate battalion by the famous London Scottish Regiment. The unit defended London during The Blitz and then served in Sicily and Italy, both in the anti-aircraft (AA) and medium artillery roles. The regiment continued in the postwar TA until amalgamated in 1955. Origin When the TA was doubled in size after the Munich Crisis the London Scottish gained enough recruits to form not one but two additional battalions; the extra battalion was formed as an AA unit. It was organised on 1 April 1939 at the London Scottish Drill Hall at 59 Buckingham Gate, Westminster, with the provisional title of 3rd Battalion, The London Scottish (97th Anti-Aircraft Regiment) and like its parent was a TA unit of the Gordon Highlanders. It consisted of Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) and 298 and 299 AA Batteries.Frederick, pp. 152, 756‚Äì60, 779.Litchfield, p. 167. World War II =Mobilisation and Phoney War= Cap Badge of the Royal Artillery (pre-1953) In June 1939, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of Anti-Aircraft Command's TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. The new regiment mobilised as part of 48 AA Brigade in 1st AA Division defending London.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. The regiment was embodied in the Royal Artillery (RA) as 97th (The London Scottish) AA Regiment, RA. While the Phoney War continued into 1940 there was little action, but AA Command's units trained hard while reinforcements and new equipment came in. 97th HAA Regiment formed a new 319 AA Bty within the regiment on 1 April 1940. On 1 June, AA units equipped with 3-inch or heavier guns, including 97th, were designated Heavy AA (HAA) regiments to distinguish them from the new Light AA (LAA) units being formed. By September 1940, 48 AA Bde controlled 28 gunsites (five still unoccupied) to the south and south-east of London as part of the London Inner Artillery Zone (IAZ). Its regiments manned a mixture of static and mobile 3.7-inch and static 4.5-inch guns, but only half the sites yet had GL Mk I gunlaying radar.Routledge, p. 388. =Battle of Britain and Blitz= Mobile 3.7-inch HAA gun preserved at Imperial War Museum Duxford. While the Luftwaffe concentrated on Royal Air Force (RAF) airfields and radar stations in south east England during the Battle of Britain, 48 AA Bde was hardly involved, but on 1 September RAF Kenley and RAF Biggin Hill on the outskirts of London were heavily bombed and next day a raid up the Thames Estuary reached the edge of the London IAZ: on both days the raids were engaged by the guns. The docks were again bombed on 7 September, one bomber stream coming in over Surrey and being engaged by 48 AA Bde. This marked a change in tactics by the Luftwaffe and from now on London became the main target, by day and night. On 9 September an afternoon raid coming in over the South Coast was heavily attacked by the RAF, but some bombers came over Surrey to London to be engaged by 48 AA Bde. By now the number of HAA guns available in the IAZ had doubled to almost 200. Between 11 and 15 September, massed daylight aids approached London, but running battles with RAF fighters broke up most of the raids before they reached the IAZ. The Battle of Britain had been won, but from now on London would be bombed continuously by night in what became known as The Blitz.Routledge, pp. 383‚Äì6.Collier, Chapter XIII.Collier, Appendix XIV.Collier, Appendix XXII.Collier, Chapter XV.Collier, Appendix XXIV.Routledge, Table LXII, p. 379‚Äì80. Manning AA positions during the Blitz was dangerous and arduous work. The HAA guns were in action night after night and often during the day as well, as the Luftwaffe directed 71 major raids against London between September 1940 and May 1941.Routledge, pp. 387‚Äì95.Collier, Appendix XXVI.Collier, Appendix XXXI. 97th HAA Regiment remained with 48 AA Bde throughout this period, and was strengthened when 376 HAA Bty was formed within the regiment on 15 October 1940.Farndale, Annex D.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396. Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/79. =Mid-war= Static 4.5-inch HAA gun and crew, 1941. The Blitz ended in mid- May 1941 when Luftwaffe units were transferred for the German invasion of Russia (Operation Barbarossa), but AA Command continued to expand. 97th HAA Regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and other ranks to 209th HAA Training Rgt at Blandford Camp to form a new 471 HAA Bty on 7 August 1941, but this battery was disbanded before being assigned to a regiment. The regiment provided another cadre to form 514 (Mixed) HAA Bty at 207th HAA Training Rgt at Devizes on 26 January 1942; this battery later joined 151st (Mixed) HAA Rgt. ('Mixed' units were those into which women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service were integrated.) By December 1941 the regiment had transferred from 48 AA Bde to the neighbouring 49 AA Bde, responsible for west and south-west London, including a number of aircraft factories. In March 1942 the regiment moved again, to 35 AA Bde covering Portsmouth in 5th AA Division. In June it switched to 5 AA Bde, which had been brought in to reinforce 5th AA Division against Luftwaffe hit-and-run attacks along the South Coast of England.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non- Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81.Routledge, pp. 401‚Äì2. However, by now 97th HAA Rgt had been earmarked for service overseas. This process began when 376 HAA Bty transferred to 131st HAA Rgt on 10 July 1942, reducing the regiment to the three-battery establishment for overseas service. It left 5 AA Bde in August, and left AA Command altogether in November, coming under War Office control with the following organisation:Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/82.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 22 November 1942, TNA file WO 212/8. * RHQ * 298, 299, 319 HAA Btys * 97 HAA Workshop Section, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) In early 1943 the regiment left for the North African theatre where it joined Eighth Army for the Allied invasion of Sicily.Joslen, pp. 466‚Äì7, 484‚Äì5. =Sicily= 97th HAA Regiment was not in the assault waves for the landings on Sicily (Operation Husky) on 10 July, but came ashore soon afterwards to reinforce 2 AA Bde in the south-east of the island, where Syracuse harbour and the captured airfields at Pachino and Cassibile were suffering dive-bombing and strafing attacks by day, and high level bombing by night and day. After the landings, Eighth Army made rapid progress up the east coast of Sicily and the follow-up AA forces began to land. 73 AA Bde HQ arrived in Augusta on 19 July, taking over responsibility for the harbour, which was also heavily attacked, while 2 AA Bde moved up the coast. 97th HAA Regiment remained with 73 AA Bde at Augusta, claiming four Category 1 'kills' and two 'probables' for 3164 rounds fired. On another occasion a Troop shot down a hostile aircraft at with 20 rounds. The regiment returned to 2 AA Bde at the end of the campaign in Sicily.Routledge, pp. 262‚Äì5; Table XLII, p. 267. =Italy= After the remaining Axis forces evacuated Sicily, Eighth Army regrouped to invade mainland Italy. The opening phase was Operation Baytown, an assault crossing of the Strait of Messina by XIII Corps supported by 2 AA Bde. Brigade HQ began reconnoitring sites to cover the operation on 18 August, the day after Messina fell, and sent forward 298 HAA Bty of 97th HAA Rgt to support XIII Corps, firing across the straits with its 3.7-inch guns in the medium artillery role. The crossing was to be made with a variety of landing craft and these required AA protection as did the assembly and embarkation points and supply dumps. 2 AA Brigade left 298/97 HAA Bty and two LAA batteries to defend these areas, while it embarked with the rest of 97th HAA Rgt and a number of other units for the landing.Routledge, pp. 269‚Äì70. Three Beach groups or 'bricks' (Nos 32‚Äì34) were allocated to control the landings, and 2 AA Bde allotted one troop (4 x 3.7-inch guns) of 97th HAA Rgt to each brick. After an extensive bombardment, XIII Corps began landing during the night of 2/3 September. There was little serious ground resistance, but enemy aircraft were active and the beaches were dive-bombed. The landing programme went smoothly, the AA batteries reached the town of Reggio Calabria on 4 September and by 5 September the brigade was fully deployed with 299/97 and 319/97 HAA Btys defending the beaches. There was only one raid of importance on Reggio, when four Focke-Wulf Fw 190s bombed the harbour and attacked the AA positions: 319/97 HAA Bty had a command post destroyed, suffering nine dead and eight wounded. XIII Corps worked cautiously and methodically through Calabria, 2 AA Bde following up to cover the small harbours and airfields, and being rejoined by 298/97 HAA Bty from Messina. In late September the brigade was warned to concentrate for a long move across Italy to defend the captured Foggia Airfield Complex. Allied shipping burns after the 2/3 December 1944 air raid on Bari. 2 AA Brigade reached Foggia and the port of Bari by 30 September, where it was reinforced. 62 AA Brigade HQ arrived on 2 October and took over responsibility for Bari, including 97th HAA Rgt, when 2 AA Bde moved on. Bari was an important supply port for Eighth Army and was targeted by the Luftwaffe. It was allocated 32 x 3.7-inch guns of 97th and 76th (Gloucestershire) HAA Rgts as well as LAA guns and searchlights, supplemented by Italian guns and searchlights. On the night of 2/3 December there was an Air raid on Bari by 88 bombers covered by clouds of 'Window' (known as D√ºppel to the Luftwaffe). Not only were the RAF and Royal Artillery radar stations blinded, but communications broke down between the two services and defensive fire only began as the first bombs fell. The guns claimed two or three bombers shot down. The bombers had been aided by the port working under full lighting, and the damage to shipping and stores was increased by the explosion of an ammunition vessel. Further attacks on 13/14 December and 31December/1 January were less successful and the raiders' casualties from AA fire were heavier (2 out of 21 and 4 out of 17 respectively).Molony, Vol V, pp. 413‚Äì4, 561.Routledge, pp. 274‚Äì5, 281. A 3.7-inch gun of 97th (London Scottish) HAA Regiment bombarding enemy positions on the Gothic Line, 2 September 1944. As the campaign progressed the Luftwaffe grew weaker and AA defence requirements diminished, freeing the versatile 3.7-inch HAA guns for other roles. They were frequently used as medium artillery in support of the ground campaign in the mountainous terrain. In the Spring of 1944 97th HAA Rgt was sent to reinforce 12 AA Bde with XIII Corps in Fifth Army for the crossing of the Rapido river and the advance up the Liri valley along Highway 6. Enemy aircraft were active, but mainly in low-level strafing and bombing, which were targets for LAA guns. The HAA guns were heavily involved in the Corps' fireplan for the crossing, and the nine HAA batteries with 12 AA Bde fired 32,875 rounds between them, some 4-gun Troops exceeding 3000 rounds. The brigade's HAA batteries were also on call for counter-mortar (CM) shoots. From the Rapido XIII Corps fought its way up Highway 6 on a narrow front and with a long 'tail'. 12 AA Brigade found itself stretched along of road and competing for road space. Each division along the column had one HAA battery assigned to its divisional artillery. After the capture of Rome on 4 June, 12 AA Bde was switched to Eighth Army on the Adriatic front.Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 76, 104‚Äì9, 166.Routledge, p. 283.'The History of HQ 12 AA Brigade 1939‚Äì1945', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 204/7254. Over the next six months the army advanced only , finally reaching the main Gothic Line positions. 97th HAA Regiment transferred back to 2 AA Bde whose units were widely distributed, some supporting XIII Corps with Fifth Army, others with X Corps and II Polish Corps under Eighth Army. The brigade's LAA regiments were deployed as infantry while its HAA regiments were now entirely committed to ground targets. During the battle of the Gothic Line each regiment fired an average of over 11,000 rounds in ground support, the tasks including counter-battery (CB), defensive fire (DF) and harassing fire (HF) shoots, but also air-burst shoots against entrenched positions, and destruction of hard targets such as buildings. The regiments suffered some casualties from retaliatory fire.2 AA Brigade, 'History of the Italian Campaign for the Period August 1944‚ÄìApril 1945', TNA file WO 204/7240.Routledge, p. 282. By late 1944 the Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious air attacks were rare. At the same time the British Army was suffering a severe manpower shortage. The result was that a number of AA units were deemed surplus and were disbanded to provide reinforcements to other arms of service. Other units remained intact but retrained as infantry for garrison duties in the rear areas. 97th HAA Regiment with 298, 299 and 319 HAA Btys was converted on 6 November 1944 into J Garrison Rgt, shortly afterwards designated 97th (London Scottish) Garrison Regiment, RA. Then on 13 February 1945 it was redesignated 610 (London Scottish) Infantry Regiment, RA, with A‚ÄìE Btys, serving in various roles until the end of the war.Farndale, Annex M.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 371‚Äì2.Routledge, Table XLIV, p. 293. 610 (London Scottish) Rgt passed into suspended animation in November‚ÄìDecember 1945 at Bari. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, 610 Regiment was reformed as 497 (London) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, at White City, Hammersmith, without any London Scottish connection. It was adopted by the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith in 1950‚Äì51 and renamed as 497 (Hammersmith) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, 474‚Äì519 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onFrederick, p. 1018. It formed part of 64 AA Brigade.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Routledge, Table LXXIV, p. 441. Watson, Territorial Army 1947. When AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955 there were wholesale mergers among its units. 497th HAA Regiment amalgamated with 452 (London) and 453/488 (London) HAA Rgts, with 497 HAA Rgt forming R (Hammersmith) Battery in the new 452 (London) HAA Rgt.Litchfield, p. 164.Frederick, p 1015. A further round of mergers on 1 May 1961 saw 452 HAA Rgt amalgamate with 264 (7th London) and 290 (City of London) Field Regiments and 353 (London) Medium Rgt to form 254 (City of London) Field Rgt, when R (Hammersmith) Bty disappeared.Litchfield, p. 150. Uniforms and insignia The regiment was allowed to retain the London Scottish cap badge and service dress (Highland pattern jacket, Hodden grey kilt and Tam O'Shanter bonnet), but in normal battledress they were badged as Royal Artillery. In 1953, following its adoption by the Borough of Hammersmith, 497 HAA Rgt was authorised to wear the coat of arms of the borough as an arm badge.

A lightning strike on July 25, 2019 was determined to be the cause. The Ikes Fire was also being utilized to fulfill its natural role within a fire-dependent ecosystem (Fire ecology) while providing for point protection of identified sensitive natural and cultural resources. Resource objectives included reducing hazardous fuels, promoting forest regeneration, improving wildlife habitat, and restoring more open forest understory. These objectives will lead to a healthier and more resilient landscape. Although the final number of firefighters and resources deployed to fight the blaze is unknown, as of August 17, 2019 they included 1 hand crew, 7 fire engines, and 1 helicopter for a total of 88 personnel. Gusty winds subsequently prevented firefighters from carrying out firing operations. Crews patrolled the perimeter on the northeast and eastern portions of the fire while other personnel continued to prep the west side of Forest Service Road 223. As of September 26, 2019, an additional two Aerial firefighting heavy-lift helicopters had been brought in to assist with the firefighting efforts. The helicopters utilized water from the Colorado River to drop on the fire to halt its spread. As of August 17, 2019 the estimated cost of the Ikes fire was estimated at around $4.6 million.

At first they gathered in either members houses or various buildings around Peoria, and in 1863 they purchased a former Presbyterian church as the first synagogue in Peoria. On October 2, 1874, new Jewish immigrants from Russia, Poland and Hungary affiliated with the Orthodox movement left Anshai Emeth to found their own congregation, named Beth Israel. After years of tensions between the two synagogues, in 1886 the two were united again, with Beth Israel selling their building and turning over their accounts to Anshai Emeth.

Career  In addition to being a journalist, Jatar has served as a lawyer and political activist. He worked closely with Caracas journalist Oscar Y√°nez, has written five books, and in the 90s he was legal advisor to the National Congress. Jatar faced extortion charges in 1991 and went to Miami, being exonerated later. According to Ana Julia Jatar, his sister, Jatar was a criminal lawyer in a case against government officials accused of corruption, and in 1989 he litigated against the secretary and lover of President Jaime Lusinchi, Blanca Ib√°√±ez. In 2007, he founded the news site Reporte Confidencial.  Detention  On 3 September 2016, Jatar was arrested by officials of the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) while on his way to a radio station in Porlamar, on Margarita Island. The arrest came a day after he published on his website, Reporte Confidencial, and social media, written and video reports about residents of Villa Rosa, in Porlamar, who welcomed President Nicol√°s Maduro with booing and cacerolazos. Maduro suddenly canceled the plans of the event in which he would inaugurate renovated apartments in the sector live on national television and the incident was reviewed by international news. Authorities said Jatar had US$25,000 in cash and accused him of planning to use them to finance an attack during the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, held on Margarita Island on 13 September of that year. Pedro Ar√©valo, a lawyer for Foro Penal, said that officials planted money on Jatar and that he was arrested in retaliation for publishing the video on his website, saying that \\"all he did was publish some videos.\\" Silvia Mart√≠nez, his wife, said he was worried because he was suffering from hypertension and was afraid that the government would imprison him on false charges. During his first hearing, on 5 September, Jatar was charged with \\"money laundering\\", facing up to 15 years in prison. His defense lawyer, Di√≥medes Potentini, declared that \\"There was no crime\\" and that the prosecution did not present any evidence. On 10 September, Jatar was transferred to the 26 de julio prison in San Juan de los Morros, in Gu√°rico state, and the prison authorities prevented him from contacting his family as part of a 30-day \\"adaptation period\\", during which he suffered from anxiety attacks, hypertension and was in the prison clinic for six days. Jatar barely saw his lawyer for the first time on 20 September, 17 days after he was arrested. On 26 September, Jatar was transferred to a prison in Cuman√°, in Sucre state, where another \\"adaptation period\\" began again, preventing him from contacting his family and denying him access to cell phones and the Internet. Braulio's wife asked the prison authorities to allow him access to a cardiologist of his choice to monitor his blood pressure and heart problems. In December, his relatives and lawyers reported that Jatar had skin cancer. His sister told the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas that the authorities had kept Jatar in solitary confinement and denied him access to sunlight, withstanding temperatures greater than 40 degrees Celsius. In April 2017, the United Nations' Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which was investigating the case, concluded that the detention was arbitrary and asked the Venezuelan government to release him. Authorities transferred the journalist to house arrest for health problems on 24 May. According to the conditions of the house arrest, Jatar had to be guarded for 24 hours by security forces, was forbidden to make public statements about his house and could only leave the house for medical reasons and with a judge's authorization. By the end of 2018, no date had been set for his trial. = Conditional release = In early April 2019, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, announced the release of Jatar and 21 other prisoners. The announcement came days after the publication of a United Nations report on human rights violations in Venezuela, which included details of the arrests and imprisonment of political dissidents. On 8 July, Jatar received and published the official notice of the criminal court on social media; Jatar is prohibited from leaving Nueva Esparta state and must appear before a court every two weeks.  Personal life  Jatar's sister Ana has spoken publicly to say that her brother sympathized with Chavismo until 2007, when \\"he realized that it was a non-democratic process\\" and a form of \\"totalitarianism\\".

He sometimes wrote under the pen-name of the Fifeshire Forester. Life He was born in 1812 in a cottage on the estate of Upper (or Over) Rankeilour House (previously known as The Mount) in the parish of Monimail in central Fife. He was the son of Alexander Bethune (d.1838), a farm labourer and weaver, and his wife Alison Christie. He was the younger brother of Alexander Bethune. In 1813 the family moved to Mains of Woodmill for a few months and then to nearby Lochend Farm near Lindores Loch in the parish of Abdie. He had no school education but was taught to read and write by his mother. His brother Alexander taught him arithmetic. Around 1822 he was apprenticed as a weaver in Collessie. He was successful at this and in 1825 set up at least two handlooms in buildings adjoining his father's cottage. However, the timing of this was unfortunate as the handloom industry was soon devastated by the widespread use of power-looms. In 1822 he was employed alongside his brother breaking rocks to create a new toll road in Fife from Lindores to Newburgh. He returned again to labouring after his weaving venture collapsed. From 1829 he worked as a labourer at Inchture estate near Perth and was promoted to overseer in 1835. He lost this job in 1838 when the estate was sold. He never regained employment and thereafter tried to make a living as a writer. Bethune died of consumption (tuberculosis) on 1 September 1839. His fame was almost entirely posthumous and largely brought about by the efforts of his brother. Bethune is thought to be buried in Abdie parish churchyard.

She was re-elected in 1998 and her tenure ended in 2003. During her terms in office, she introduced an internet-based Information Network of Arkansas, encouraged participation in elections and in the 2000 US Census, and worked towards electoral reform. She also served as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State. Background Priest was born on September 12, 1947 in Montreal, Quebec. She worked in Canada with a distributor for the American company Munsey Products before moving to Little Rock, Arkansas upon her marriage in 1974. While in Little Rock, Priest prepared taxes for H & R Block from 1976 to 1978 and worked at a real estate company she had opened from 1983 to 1986. She later was a membership director for a chamber of commerce from 1990 to 1994. During this time period, Priest started her political career as a member of the board of directors (city council) for Little Rock in 1986. For the city, she was the deputy mayor of Little Rock from 1989 to 1990 and reappointed to the board of directors in 1990. The following year, Priest became the mayor of Little Rock in January 1991 and held her mayorship until December 1992. Running as a Democrat in 1994, Priest beat Julia Hughes Jones to become the Secretary of State of Arkansas. With her win, Priest became the first woman to take office as Secretary of State of Arkansas as the result of an election. Overall, Priest was the second woman to become Arkansas's secretary of state, as Nancy J. Hall was appointed after her husband died during his office term in 1961. Priest was reelected as Arkansas's Secretary of State in 1998, defeating candidate Rose Bryant Jones. She remained as Secretary of State for Arkansas until 2003. During her years in office, Priest made information about the state government, and held in the office of the Secretary of State, more accessible. In 1995, she launched the internet-based Information Network of Arkansas, and also reduced the cost of photocopies of information held in the Secretary of State's offices from 80c per page to 25c per page. She attempted to boost the number of people voting in elections through programs such as \\"Honor a Vet with a Vote\\", designed to raise awareness \\"that voting is a precious right\\", and Mock Election, a program for high schools students which won an award offered by Time Magazine/National Association of State Boards of Education. During 2000, she visited all counties of Arkansas to encourage participation in the federal census, after estimates that around 42,000 residents of Arkansas were omitted from the 1990 US census, resulting in a loss of $280,000,000 in federal funding. Priest also served as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, and chaired a committee of the association which investigated possible election reforms at the national level, and made 15 recommendations intended to avoid the voting problems of the 2000 US presidential election. Within Arkansas, Priest also wanted to change the method of tracking ballots, so that they would no longer be linked to individual voters. However, the proposed electoral reforms foundered due to a downturn in the economy, and Priest was reported as saying, \\"Unless there's a real uprising on the part of the people in this country who will call their congressmen and senators and say, \\"Elections are important to us and democracy comes at a price, and we're willing to pay that price - do something!\\" then I'm not sure, running into budgets now, that anything's going to get done.\\" After her governmental position for Arkansas ended, Priest worked at the Downtown Little Rock Partnership from 2003 to 2015 as an executive director. In the late 2010s, Priest became a bookkeeper for a plumbing company run by her son.

Biography  Roberts was born in Liverpool on 12 June 1823 to a Welsh family. Before taking up English billiards, he worked as a carpenter. He managed the Union Club billiards room in Manchester from 1845 to 1852 after spending some time in Oldham as a billiard marker, a role that involved keeping the score of billiards matches. He then became landlord of a hotel, The Griffin. In 1847, his son John Roberts Jr. was born. Edwin Kentfield, known as Jonathan Kentfield, was the self-declared champion of billiards when Roberts challenged him for the title in 1849. Kentfield declined to play, and so Roberts styled himself as champion, a title he held unchallenged until 1870, when he lost to William Cook. Roberts embarked on a playing tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1864‚Äì65. In 1885, a meeting took place at The Sportsman's offices to consider revising the rules of billiards, chaired by a Mr A. H. Collins-Orme and attended by the majority of the prominent professional billiards players. The Billiard Association was formed, and ten players, including John Roberts Jr., and Roberts Sr., were tasked with authoring a new set of rules for English billiards. Roberts died on 27 March 1893 at Stratford, London. He was sometimes known by the nickname of \\"Liverpool Jack.\\" His highest recorded break was 346, in 1862. In his playing prime, he could reputedly beat other players who were using a standard whilst Roberts used an adapted walking-stick.

Career She was educated at St. John's Wood High School and received a 3rd class LLB from University College London in 1893.The Historical Record (1836-1912) Being a Supplement to the Calendar Completed to September 1912, p. 409, University of London, Hodder & Stoughton, 1912 She was a partner with Eliza Orme, the first woman in England to receive a law degree (also from UCL), at their law office from the mid-1880s on Chancery Lane. She was on the executive of the Women's National Liberal Association 1897-1902, a trustee of the Mary Macarthur Home, and a member of the government's Central Committee on Women‚Äôs Employment during World War I. Lawrence volunteered for the homeless on the Hampstead Distress Committee from 1905 and promoted reform of the swimming baths. In the first year that women were no longer prohibited from standing for election in the United Kingdom, following the passing of the Qualification of Women Act, Lawrence stood in a by-election in Belsize ward to Hampstead Borough Council following the resignation of C. S. Preston. The first women borough councillors, seven in England and one in Scotland, had been elected on November 1. Lawrence was elected on December 12, 1907 with a majority of 319 votes. She gained support from Orme and the Hampstead Women's Local Government Society, stressing that she was not a suffragette. A contemporary newspaper reported she was \\"strongly recommended by several members of Parliament and local aldermen and councillors\\". She was on the baths, distress, public health, and works committees. Another woman, Quaker social worker Mary E. Balkhill, was elected unopposed to Kilburn ward in Hampstead the following May. Despite support from the Hampstead Non-Political and Progressive Association, Lawrence lost the subsequent election in October 1909 by six votes. Personal life Reina was born in New York to an Anglo-Jewish family.Reina Lawrence, United States Census, 1870, via familysearch.org Her father John Moss Lawrence was an merchant and investor, and her mother Emily was from Spanish Town, Jamaica.

Lawrence was featured in an exhibition at Holborn library in Camden from December 2007 to January 2008, alongside Mary Wollstonecraft and Elizabeth Garrett Anderson. Lawrence's election was included in a 2009 government \\"Women in power\\" factsheet that left out the election of Margaret Thatcher as the first woman Prime Minister.

The Pioneers of Martins Bay The Pioneers of Martins Bay is a historical book by Mackenzie, describing her early life at Martins Bay in the 1870s and 1880s. As a child, McKenzie and her family moved from Hokitika to Jackson Bay in Westland. After that they moved to Jamestown on Lake McKerrow. The township of Jamestown flopped and the McKenzies drifted down to Martins Bay. The hardships and isolation that followed the move are innumerable. Alice grew up in these isolated and lonely conditions and grew up to write the book. The book was first published in 1947 by the Southland Historical Committee, and a revised edition was self-published in 1952.Hall-Jones, John. Martins Bay. Craig Printing Co. Ltd., Invercargill, New Zealand, 1987. Moa sighting South Island Giant Moa, Dinornis robustus (foreground) and Pachyornis elephantopus (background). McKenzie grew up in what was then New Zealand's most remote settlement Martins Bay, then part of Otago, but now part of Fiordland National Park. In 1880, as an eight-year-old, Alice had a meeting with a large bird that she believed had been a takahe for many years. But when that bird was suddenly rediscovered in the 1940s, and Alice saw what it looked like, she knew that she had seen something else. She was interviewed by the New Zealand Broadcasting Service in 1959: \\"It was lying on the sand, sunning itself. \\"I got nearer and nearer until I sat down on the sand behind it. I remember stroking its back. It had no tail. \\"It just lay there, it was quite quiet. So I put my hand underneath it and drew out one of its legs. It took no notice of me. I started to tie the flax around it, I thought I'd tie it up. \\"Then it got up and made a harsh, grunting cry and bit at me. And I ran as hard as I could over the sandhills towards the sea. I thought if I went down to the sea it mightn't follow me into the water. I never looked behind, it never came very far with me. \\"When I got home and told my father he came to have a look. But the bird was gone when he came. He saw its tracks where it had followed me from the top of the sandhills but it didn't go over them. \\"He had a foot-rule in his pocket and he measured the tracks.

The Chronicles narrate events of the lives of James I of Aragon, Bernat Desclot, Ramon Muntaner and Pere el Cerimoni√≥s. The four chronicles were written with the same purpose: to justify the political actions of the rulers as well as passing their political knowledge onto their descendants. They are among the most complete historiographical sets of documents of medieval Europe, and are valued by historians for their detailed descriptions of the social and political aspects of Catalan feudal society. The Four Great Catalan Chronicles The Four Great Catalan Chronicles are: The Chronicle of James I of Aragon (Llibre dels fets) There are two versions of this work. The first, which is titled Llibre dels fets, is written in Catalan. The second, which is titled Libre Gestarum, is written in Latin and is signed by Pere Marsili; dating from 1313. Because of the historical events that took place between the years 1272 and 1274, it is generally agreed by scholars that this chronicle was possibly written during the last years of James I's reign. Nevertheless, both versions of the chronicles recount the same facts‚Äîthe only difference between them is the literary form in which they were written. While the Catalan version is written in first person singular form, the Latin version is written in third person singular form. It is thus widely accepted that the chronicle constitutes an autobiography and can be attributed to James I; while the narrative belongs to no one but the king himself, this is not true of the text. Historical research has concluded that James' chronicle was written by different scholars in the form of oral dictation, recounting the life and most important deeds of James I. The narrative begins with his birth in 1208 and ends in the last years of his reign at an advanced stage of his life, around the year 1274. Among James' most remarkable deeds we find a highly detailed narration of the Muslim expulsion and conquest of Mallorca and Valencia. The Chronicle of Bernat Desclot (Llibre del rei en Pere d'Arag√≥) In the Chronicle of Bernat Desclot, there is no date or event mentioned that would that give researchers an idea of the exact year of its writing. However, since Bernat mentions at the end of the chronicle the conquest of Sicily in 1283, historians have agreed that the text could have been produced towards the end of Bernat's life; between 1283 and 1286. This chronicle narrates the deeds and conquests of Catalonia and the Kingdom of Arag√≥n during the Reconquista, from the crowning of Alfonso I until the reign of Peter II of Aragon. The text focuses on Pere II, Bernat's main purpose appearing to be the glorification of Pere II as king. One of the most remarkable aspects of this chronicle as a literary text is its detailed narration of medieval legends and troubadour tales. Bernat also describes in detail other singular aspects and values of the time such as the importance of the chivalric spirit, of loyalty among knights, and of the horrors of war. The Chronicle of Ramon Muntaner (Llibre de Ramon Muntaner) Ramon Muntaner wrote the lengthiest of the four Catalan Chronicles. Muntaner was born in Peralada in 1256 and died in Mallorca in 1336. This chronicle dates from the same year in which he wrote his memoirs, 1325. Apart from being the lengthiest of the four texts, this chronicle also comprises a long period in history: from James I's birth in 1208 to the crowning of Alfonso III in 1328. Between 1208 and 1328, Ramon Muntaner gives special attention to the lives of the kings who ruled during his lifetime. Although Muntaner uses other information sources such as historiographical texts as well as epic narratives, most of his chronicle is based on his own thoughts and experiences regarding the events that take place in the narrative, lending this work credibility and making it an exceptionally complete historiographical document of medieval Europe. The Chronicle of Peter IV (Llibre de Pere el Cerimoni√≥s) The Chronicle of Peter IV was written in two parts. The first part between the years 1375 and 1383, and the second part in 1386. The text is written in first person singular, with authorship of the narrative being attributed to Peter III of Aragon. The chronicle begins with the reign of Peter's father, Alfonso IV, and ends with the marriage of Peter's sons in 1370.  References  Bibliography Aguilar √Ävila, Josep Antoni.

It has the variable star designation UU Comae Berenices, while 21 Comae Berenices is the Flamsteed designation. According to R. H. Allen, English orientalist Thomas Hyde attributed the ancient title Kissƒ´n to this star, a name that comes from a climbing plant ‚Äì either bindweed or dog rose. This star has a white hue and is just visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude that fluctuates around 5.47. Based upon parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of approximately 272 light years away from the Sun. It is a single star but is a confirmed physical member of the Melotte 111 open cluster. This object has been studied extensively since 1953, producing some occasionally contradictory results such as hints of pulsational behavior or a binary companion. It is a weakly magnetic chemically peculiar star of type CP2, or Ap star, that is most likely on the main sequence. The stellar classification is A3p SrCr, where the suffix notation indicates abundance anomalies of the iron-peak element chromium, as well as strontium. This is an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum (ACV) variable, which indicates it varies in luminosity as it rotates due to spots on its surface created by a magnetic field. The range of variation has an amplitude of 0.02 magnitude and a period of just over two days. Samus et al. (2017) have it classified as a low-amplitude Delta Scuti variable, although this is disputed. The age of the Melotte 111 cluster, and therefore this star, lies in the range of 400‚Äì800 million years. The star has a projected rotational velocity of 63 km/s, with a polar inclination of 64¬∞ or greater, resulting in a rotation period of 2.05 days. Stellar evolutionary models yield a mass of around 2.3 times that of the Sun and 2.6 times the Sun's radius for this object. It is radiating 38 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 8,900 K.

She was awarded the Ir√®ne Joliot-Curie Prize in 2012 and elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2019.  Early life and education  Cavazzana was born in Venice. Her father worked on the railway and her mother was a teacher. She studied medicine in Padua, where she completed her residency at the University of Padua. She moved to Paris, where she earned her doctorate at the Paris Diderot University studying bone marrow transplants with √âlaine Gluckman at the H√¥pital Saint-Louis.  Research and career  Cavazzana joined the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in 1987, where she worked with Alain Fischer and Claude Gricelli. She was appointed to Professor of Immunology in 1994. She served as Director of the Institut national de la sant√© et de la recherche m√©dicale (INSERM) in 1994. In 2003 she was made Head of the Haematology Department and Director of Biotherapy at the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital. She established the first Clinical Investigation Center in the Assistance Publique ‚Äì H√¥pitaux de Paris, which is the only French academic department is authorised to produce cell and gene therapies. Her research considers the haematopoietic immune system and gene therapy. She has designed clinical trials based on lentiviral vector in gene therapy and pioneered the use of haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy for genetic immune and haematopoietic disorders. In 2002 Cavazzana started working with Philippe Leboulch trying to develop clinical prootocols for the treatment of anemia. Cavazzana was the first doctor to successfully treat a boy with sickle cell disease, a severe form of hereditary chronic anemia. Sickle cell disease is a blood disorder that results from an abnormality in red blood cells. It occurs due to a mutation on the HBB gene, and results in a sickle- like deformity of red blood cells. It is the most common genetic disorder in France. The first gene therapy trail of young boys with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency was performed by Cavazzana in collaboration with bluebird bio in 2000. When it was established that two of the boys developed leukaemia from the gene therapy, Cavazzana coordinated the medical efforts of biologists, virologists, clinicians and regulators to develop novel medical therapies. In 2010 she performed gene therapy on a child with beta thalassemia. Children who are born with Thalassemia Major often develop anaemia within their first years of life. Cavazzana went on to provide gene therapy to sickle cell disease in 2014 and the first patient with Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome. Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome is an immunodeficiency associated with microthrombocytopenia. The child with sickle cell disease had a restored clinical and biological phenotype within sixth months of the gene therapy. In 2017 Cavazzana was involved in re-writing the French bioethics laws, in particular, Law 2011-814. The law requires close family members to be informed when individuals are at risk of developing a genetically transmitted illness.

Jacobs or the Gerritsen Collection of Women's History) is a diverse collection of women's archival materials and feminist records covering fifteen languages and over 4,700 volumes. Acquired by the John Crerar Library of Chicago in 1903, it was subsequently sold to the University of Kansas in 1954. In the 21st century, the holdings were digitized and are now widely available through subscription to libraries worldwide. History In 1903, Aletta Jacobs, one of the first women physicians in the Netherlands and an active international suffragist, sold her collection of feminist books, magazines, and pamphlets to the John Crerar Library of Chicago. At the time she sold the records, she was ending her medical practice to devote herself to the suffrage cause. The collection bears her husband, Carel Victor Gerritsen's surname, in spite of the fact that Jacobs and Gerritsen had a premarital agreement that she would retain her own surname. She had compiled around 2,000 volumes of materials mostly focused on Dutch, French and German works, with a few early works about women in English. The works spanned the period from the 16th to the 20th century, with the majority of the materials focused on the nineteenth century. For over three decades the materials were left to languish, unavailable to scholars and still boxed. With the creation of the National Archives and Records Administration in 1934, preservation efforts increased throughout the United States and a push was started to collect unpublished source materials. The Crerar Library began adding English titles to the collection, doubling its size, and in 1954, sold it to the University of Kansas, in Lawrence. Housed in the Kenneth Spencer Research Library, curators continued adding titles to the collection through 1975. In the 1970s several publishing houses, such as Arno Press, Garland Publishers, and Source Book Press, reprinted some of the feminist works in the collection which were written in English. Microfilming of the collection began in 1974, as a way to both preserve the records and share them with other archives and libraries. It took over three years to complete filming. In the 21st century, ProQuest digitized the Gerritsen Collection, in two segments. One includes the nearly 4,000 books called the Monograph Language Series and the other section comprises around 700 periodicals and pamphlets and is referred to as the Periodical Series. The digitized product is available to subscribers. Collections One of the earliest volumes in the collection is Lodovico Dolce's Dialogo della institution delle donne (Dialogue of Women's Institutions, 1547) and translations dating to 1566 and 1726 of Agrippa von Nettesheim's arguments in favor of \\"the nobility and excellence of the female sex\\". A large portion of the collection covers the 19th century suffrage and women's rights movements, containing material on most of the pioneers of the German movement; scholarly articles analyzing socio-economic and political rights of women, as well as topics which effected women such as the family and prostitution; and popular articles on women‚Äôs rights. There were also works by and about activists like Helen Blackburn (UK), Emily Davies (UK), Charlotte Perkins Gilman (US), Ellen Key (Sweden), and Mary Wollstonecraft (UK), among many others. Periodicals dating from 1832, besides German and English titles, focus on both suffrage and anti-suffrage works from Arab countries, Australia, Austria, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, and Switzerland. There are volumes in the collection dating to the 17th century, which focus on women's legal status. Some evaluate particular legal problems, while others evaluate historical periods, or country-specific legal systems. A significant portion of the legal documents evaluate prostitution in countries like Algeria, Cuba, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Africa, and the United States. About 20% of the volumes dealing with legal status were written by women. Other parts of the collection focus on women's education and employment. These include historical surveys, research papers, and reports, and material both by and about women. The documents are largely about women in Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands and the United States. Many of the works on employment focus on job training, how-to guides for employment, unionization, as well as women‚Äôs employment in a variety of occupations. In addition to works on anthropological and sociological examinations of marital and sexual relationships, dating to the 18th century, there were books on women's roles in religion, and a large section both autobiographical and biographical works about women, mostly in Dutch, English, French, and German, though the entire collection covers works in fifteen languages.

However, the construction type and other characteristics indicate that it was built sometime in the second half of the 14th century or in the first half of the 15th century.https://ww1sites.eu/index.php?id=35&tx;_wwicaheritage_caheritage%5BcaHeritage%5D=40&tx;_wwicaheritage_caheritage%5Baction%5D=show&tx;_wwicaheritage_caheritage%5Bcontroller%5D=CaHeritage&cHash;=653a068d9153629a9b9cd8c0ee6db83e As a result It was probably built during the time of the Bosnian Kings Tvrtko II or Ostoja, and then rebuilt and expanded during the time of Stephen Thomas. The Travnik fortress was erected before the arrival of the Ottoman Turks for the purpose of defense, as the Ottomans penetrated deeper into Bosnia. Travnik itself was one of a number of fortified towns in the region built for this purpose, but was built too late to stem the Ottoman advance. In 1462 King Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá was accepted as a vassal of HungaryB√°nlaky (1929), p. 39 and thereafter refused to pay tribute to the Porte. As a consequence both Ottoman and Christian sides began war preparations.Stavrides (2001), p. 146 Sultan Mehmed II gathered an army of 150,000 soldiers in Adrianopolis and departed for the Lower Danube area in April 1463.Fessler (1867), p. 103 (a number excluding the infantry and retinues) As a part of a diversion attack, he commanded Ali Bey Mihaloƒülu to invade southern lands of the Kingdom of Hungary. The Bey crossed into Syrmia, but was pushed back by Andrew Pongr√°cz, Master of the cupbearers. He then made a flanking move to the heart of Hungary until he reached Temesv√°r, where he encountered John Pongr√°c Voivode of Transylvania and was defeated in a fierce battle.Borovszky (1898), p. 357 Meanwhile, Mehmet II had advanced on Travnik, which he besieged and took. That year the Bosnian Kingdom fell to the Ottomans. From 1463, until 1878, Travnik was under Ottoman rule, becoming part of the Sanjak of Bosnia.

The Circle serves to mentor the next generation of African women theologians throughout their academic careers in order to counter the dearth of academic theological literature by African women. The Circle has chapters in more than a dozen countries across the African continent, as well as diaspora chapters in Europe and North America.  History  The organization was formally established in 1989 at Trinity College in Legon, Ghana, with 79 founding members convened by the Ghanaian theologian Mercy Oduyoye. Oduyoye contends it informally began in 1976 when she invited female scholars of theology and religion to join the Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians. However, quota limits hindered these activities, which gave a stimulus for ultimately establishing the Circle. The official launch in 1989 was as \\"a culmination of a decade-long work and the realisation that while women were the majority in faith-based organisations, they were visibly absent in religious leadership and academic study of religion.\\" Oduyoye was working at the World Council of Churches at the time of founding. Hence, the group awarded the WCC its Appreciation of Partnership Award at its 5th pan-African conference in 2019 \\"because the WCC created the space in which the Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians was born and flourished.\\" The Circle has highlighted issues related to sexuality, including concerns around violence against women and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It has published over 30 books by group authorship and several single-author monographs written by Circle members. The Circle was also instrumental in establishing a research center for women, religion and culture in Accra, Ghana, and a women's resource center in Limurua, Kenya. According to the World Council of Churches, the Circle has \\"contributed research and writing that has added immeasurably to the ecumenical movement, particularly in the area of gender justice.\\" In July 2019, the Circle celebrated its 30th anniversary at its 5th pan-African conference at the University of Botswana in Gaborone. The four-day conference was held on the theme \\"Mother Earth, Mother Africa in Religious Imagination\\" and was attended by scholars from 17 countries. At the anniversary celebration, founder Mercy Oduyoye noted that the Circle's first meeting was held in 1980, but that it was officially launched in 1989. At the time, Oduyoye said, there was only one women serving as a representative in the synod of her church, even though 80 percent of the congregants in churches were women. Keynote speaker Puleng LenkaBula added that the work of the Circle did not only acknowledge \\"the evil of oppression in our societies, but also the injustice of colonialism of our bodies and of the earth.\\" For LenkaBula, the Circle represents \\"a contestation and a call for justice, but also a path that feminist and womanist theologians came to shape the narratives that were often muted in church and society.\\"  References   Further reading  * * Category:World Christianity Category:Christianity in Africa ","title":"Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians"},{"id":"62221851","text":"Terrell Lewis (born August 25, 1998 as Terrell Hall) is an American football outside linebacker for the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL).

Political beginning =Ideology= Rashid follows the political ideology of socialism. =The Emergency Times= Rashid's political struggle started in 2007, when he was a student in LUMS, during Lawyers' Movement, initiated by lawyers of Pakistan against the military dictatorship of Pervez Musharraf. On November 7, 2007, he along with 1,000 students of his university, gathered to protest the emergency rule imposed by Musharraf's televised emergency announcement on November 3, 2007. After his teacher's (Aasim Sajjad Akhtar) arrest, he along with other students was also got arrested during the protest. Major Pakistani news networks were not allowed to cover the student protest at LUMS, so Rashid took the initiative to start a newsletter named as ‚ÄúThe Emergency Times‚Äù (November, 2007 - June, 2008) to narrate the protests‚Äô details, to help students speak about democracy and organize against emergency rule. The newsletter described itself as ‚Äúan independent Pakistani student information initiative providing regular updates, commentary, and analysis on Pakistan‚Äôs evolving political scenario.‚Äù Politics =Awami Workers Party= Rashid is a senior and leading member of the Awami Workers Party (AWP) since the party was founded in 2012. He served as general secretary and information secretary AWP Rawalpindi-Islamabad in 2014‚Äì2015. As political worker of AWP, Rashid has been involved in struggle for the right to affordable housing and shelter in Islamabad in 2015. He organized legal and political resistance to the inhumane and illegal evictions of people from Kachi Abadi (informal settlements) driven by Capital Development Authority (CDA). While working with All Pakistan Kachi Abadi Alliance, Rashid talked about the flaws in system about rights to housing by people from informal settlements. He said, ‚ÄúUnder the Urban Shelter Program the CDA legalized a few slums and left the rest out in the lurch, because the national policy dictated that any slums setup after March 1985 were illegal. We have in our possession voter lists consisting of thousands of people living in the I-11 and other katchi abadis as far back as the 1985 General Election.‚Äù On July 30, 2015, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) along with police, local administration and rangers, demolished dwellings of ‚ÄòKatchi Abadi‚Äô (informal settlements) in sector I-11/1, Islamabad destroying dozens of houses built since last 30 years. On August 2, 2015, to stop these forceful evictions and fight for solution of this urban housing crisis in informal settlements of I-11/1, Rashid along with Aasim Sajjad Akhtar and residents from Kachi Abadi, filed a petition in the Supreme Court for the case on the right to housing. It was requested in petition that the court declare the residents of katchi abadis of the federal capital entitled to the benefits conferred under Articles 9, 10A and 25 of the Constitution.‚ÄúIt should be declared that the state is bound to provide the residents of katchi abadis shelter and other amenities as per the Constitution and the National Housing Policy 2001.‚Äù On August 26, 2015, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered the federal government and other departments to stop further demolishing of houses in katchi abadi I-11, Islamabad. In a court filing, CDA claimed it needed to demolish informal settlements as their growing Christian population would threaten the city's Muslim majority. CDA stated: ‚ÄúIt seems this pace of occupation of land by Christian community may increase‚Ä¶ removal of katchi abadies is very urgent to provide better environment to the citizen of Islamabad and to protect the beauty of Islam.‚Äù Rashid told the newspaper, ‚ÄúThe move was old-fashioned bigotry against minorities and working classes. The administrative body has no right to be making decisions about the religious demography of Islamabad.‚Äù Rashid was elected as president of Awami Workers Party Punjab unit in its third congress held on January 17, 2020 in Faisalabad. On 28 January 2020, Islamabad police arrested Rashid along with two members of the Awami Workers Party (Nawfal Saleemi and Saifullah Nasar), one member of Progressive Students Federation and 19 other protesters while they were holding a peaceful protest demanding the release of Pashtun peace activist Manzoor Pashteen, in front of the National Press Club, Islamabad. They were accused of entirely concocted charges of sedition against the state. Additional District and Sessions Judge refused to grant post-arrest bail to the 23 protesters and sent them to jail. The protesters appealed in Islamabad High Court where they were granted bail by chief justice Athar Minallah on February 3, 2020. The chief justice Athar Minallah, summoned the Islamabad City Magistrate, asking an explanation for first placing sedition charges on peaceful protesters and later turned them into terrorism charges in the first information report (FIR). On February 17, 2020, Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat told Islamabad High court that all charges against the 23 protesters had been dropped by Islamabad administration. As president AWP, Punjab, he supported Aurat Azadi March 2020 held in Islamabad. General Elections 2018 Rashid contested for the 2018 Pakistani general election on National assembly seat NA-53 in federal capital Islamabad. Out of 312142, he secured 912 votes. His electoral campaign included the agenda of ‚Äúsocial justice, democracy, gender equality, secularism and environmentally sustainable development‚Äù. Rashid vowed to revive left-wing politics by bringing back ideological strength to politics. His election manifesto focused to solve water problem, Rs. 30,000 as minimum wage with continuous increase in proportional to the price hike, allocation of 10% of the total GDP for education and free education to everyone. During the 2018 election campaign, Rashid along with his party workers, due to security concerns, were not allowed to enter Islamabad with election material, which included relevant banners but he said that Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) banners could be seen across Islamabad. According to him, this certainly strengthens the narrative that these elections are engineered and Pakistan cannot afford these allegations at this point.\\"  Student politics Rashid is strong supporter of potential of country's youth to carry out political struggles and voice their opinion against all odds by thinking and differentiating between the wrong and right and will always continue to stand for the right. Rashid, on social media expressed solidarity with the campaign organizers of Students Solidarity March, 2018 along with other notable personalities like Iqbal Lala (father of the late Mashal Khan, Bushra Gohar, Jalila Haider, Nida Kirmani, Jibran Nasir, Farooq Tariq.

On April 13, 2019, Rashid urged students and progressive people to join the Mashal March, to honor Mashal Khan who was killed by his fellow students in university campus on false accusation of blasphemy. Rashid said that the march would call for structural reform of what he described as rotten education system that produced Mashal's killers. On October 24, 2019, a large number of students, political workers and activists gathered for Student Housing Rights March (Talba Haq-e-Rihayesh March) in Islamabad, protesting against CDA for its forceful eviction of students from private hostels in Islamabad. The march was organized by Progressive Students Federation (PRSF), Student Hostelites Association (SHA), supported by Awami Workers Party (AWP). Rashid, as an organizer of the march, addressed to the occasion, \\"the broader crisis in higher education which includes funding cuts for the HEC, fee hikes, endemic and widespread harassment as evident from University of Balochistan‚Äôs case and management high handedness, which led to Inam‚Äôs death at COMSATS University Islamabad.\\" On November 29, 2019, Rashid organized and performed in the Students Solidarity March, 2019. Revolutionary Music Rashid is also a musician. His music is a mix of acoustic, classical and folk and he regularly performs revolutionary songs and poetry at political events organized by his political party.

On May 9, 2015, under the banner of Rashid's party, AWP and National Students Federation (NSF), a concert titled as Songs of Freedom-2015 was held at the Aabpara Community Centre, Islamabad to raise awareness of student politics and political rights in city's youth and to make them appreciate revolutionary music and art. As information secretary of AWP Islamabad-Rawalpindi, Rashid played guitar and sang the revolutionary songs: ‚ÄúHum dekhein gay‚Äù, ‚ÄúAaj bazaar main‚Äù along with Kalaam of Khawaja Ghulam Farid and other classical Sufi poets.

Student unions were banned by Gen Ziaul Haq in 1984 in an attempt to suppress expressions of dissent against his dictatorship. During campaign of 2018 Pakistani general election, Rashid released an official Election Campaign Song along with an explosive music video to boost popularity of AWP among Pakistanis. The song titles as ‚ÄòChehre Nahi Samaaj Ko Badlo‚Äô (Change the society, Not just faces).

Study Circles and Political Schools Rashid, along with his other party workers helps in organizing political schools and study circles to raise awareness about understanding of social, economic and political structures of inequality and oppression along with methods of organizing progressive political resistance and ideological strengthening in Pakistani people. The agenda of this initiative is to act like a modern alternative to Pakistan's age-old curriculum, focusing on a radicalized concept of ‚Äòdismantling systems of oppression‚Äô, to target the root of issues plaguing society so that, effective solutions can be designed. On September 2, 2018, the second day of political school, Rashid delivered a lecture on \`Capitalism: On the Roots of our Economic Crisis'.

The home  The location of the shooting in Orinda, California was a residential house that had been rented through Airbnb by a woman who had reportedly told the property owner that she was hosting a family reunion for 12 people, and that some guests had asthma and needed to gather at a location free of wildfire smoke. (The shooting took place during the Kincade Fire, which was burning about 85 miles north of Orinda). Due to the rental only being a one-night rental on Halloween, the owner told the renter that no parties were allowed. The owner of the 4,000-square-foot (372-square-meter) four-bedroom house told reporters that they reached out to the renter after neighbors contacted them about the party. The home was equipped with a doorbell camera which the property owner used to verify that a party was taking place that violated the rental agreement. The house reportedly last sold for $1.2 million in 2017, and was renting for $420 a night on Airbnb at the time of the party.  Incident  The shooting happened Halloween night at a party that was attended by at least 100 people. Neighbors had placed calls to police complaining about noise, shortly after 9 PM, and some officers were dispatched to the home. Additional police responded to the home after getting reports at 10:45 pm local time of gunshots being fired inside a short-term rental home, when officers arrived many of those at the party were fleeing the scene. A party- goer claimed that there was no warning to the event, and that there had been no argument or physical altercation prior to the shooting.  Victims  Four men in their twenties were killed, while a 19-year-old female died of her injuries on November 1. Several others were injured, either through gunshots or from fleeing the scene.  Investigation  The Contra Costa County Sheriff's Office crime lab has begun an investigation into the incident and the two firearms that were retrieved from the home. San Francisco Police investigated possible links between two of the victims, the Page Street Mob gang, and a quadruple homicide in 2015. The Contra Costa County Sheriff‚Äôs Department served search warrants November 14, 2019 in the morning in San Mateo, Marin City, Vallejo and Antioch in connection to the arrests of five individuals. Four of the suspects were charged with murder and conspiracy and the fifth was charged as an accessory. On November 18 all of the suspects were released as the county district attorney declined to press charges pending further investigation. Multiple law enforcement agencies have described the incident as a shootout. On November 21, 2019, the Contra Costs Sheriff's Department and Federal Agents arrested two more suspects on weapons and child endangerment charges, seizing a gun linked to this and multiple other shootings.  Response  A memorial was created outside the home, and a large memorial of flowers, photos of the individuals who died, and notes of sympathy were left at a fountain in downtown Orinda. One sign at the memorial read, \\"Your lives matter.\\" Airbnb's co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky announced a change in company policy on November 2, stating that the company would carry out a site-wide ban on \\"party houses\\" and would implement a system that would screen for and flag potential high-risk reservations. The company will also create a dedicated rapid response team, to take immediate action against users who violate the new guest policies including the potential removal of the guests or renters. Council members of the city scheduled a special hearing shortly after the shooting to discuss the incident and to determine if there was a need for possible regulations to prohibit out-of-control parties. Other concerns addressed during the meeting were rental properties, in which a short-termed ordinance banning short-term rentals was passed and property owners are now required to register with the city if they plan on renting a room or home for less than 30 days. Some residents in Orinda and the greater San Francisco Bay Area expressed frustration that reaction to the shooting focused more on Airbnb policy than on empathy for the victims. There were questions about whether the news coverage of this event, where all the victims were persons of color, was comparable to that for other mass shootings.

It was first conceived and built during the Ayyubid period (under Salah ad-Din and his successors) but was later reworked by several Mamluk sultans to expand the provision of water to the Citadel of Cairo. Although no longer functioning today, much of the aqueduct structure, including its water intake tower, still stands.  History  An 1838 illustration of the Fumm al-Khalig water intake tower. = The Ayyubid aqueduct = The Citadel of Cairo was a massive fortified complex and royal residence begun by Salah ad-Din (Saladin) in 1176 CE and most likely finished by al-Kamil at the beginning of the 13th century. The Citadel was the centerpiece of a new extensive defensive system for Cairo which included building a long wall around both Cairo and the older city of Fustat and connecting it to the Citadel. Salah ad-Din, or one of his Ayyubid successors, also developed the idea of bringing water from the Nile to the Citadel by building a canal along the top of this wall. The aqueduct started from the wall's western end near Fustat (at the shore of the Nile), where water was raised through a series of waterwheels, and ran from there to the Citadel. This project was likely carried out or finished by al-Kamil (even though the full course of the defensive wall Salah ad-Din had envisioned was never fully finished). This aqueduct system was built in addition to the famous Spiral Well built by Salah ad-Din (also known as the Bi'r Yusuf) inside the Citadel, which could provide water in times of siege in case the aqueduct was cut off. = The first Mamluk aqueduct under al-Nasir Muhammad = Qarafa cemetery region on its way to the Citadel, in 1890. During the Mamluk period, the Citadel was further developed by successive sultans into an even more elaborate complex, with more ambitious buildings. In particular, under Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad in the early 14th century the Citadel was expanded and several important palaces and monuments were built within and around it. In 1311 or 1312, al-Nasir Muhammad ordered the renovation and improvement of the Citadel's aqueduct. His predecessor and brother, Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil, was likely responsible for having already built the water intake tower but was likely killed before he could do more. Al-Nasir completed the project. The intake tower was located on the shore of the Nile in the area now known as Fumm al-Khalig, north of Fustat (or \\"Old Cairo\\" today) and further north than the Ayyubid-era wall and canal. The intake tower is hexagonal and featured four waterwheels (saaqiyyas) which raised water to the top of the tower, from where it flowed along a set of channels along the aqueduct. Along the way, al- Nasir built another tower with three more waterwheels raising the water to an even higher level, after which it continued to run along an aqueduct until it reached the foot of the citadel, at which point it was yet again raised by waterwheels in another tower. From this last tower the water then entered into the Citadel and into a reservoir known as the Bi'r al-Sa'b Sawaqi (\\"Well of the Seven Waterwheels\\"), inside the Citadel's Southern Enclosure (near the harem area) and southwest of the famous Spiral Well of Salah ad-Din. From this reservoir, water was distributed by an underground network to the rest of the buildings in the Citadel. The aqueduct itself consisted of a channel carried along the top of large stone piers and arches, which ran for about one-and-a- half kilometers due east before turning northeast, and after half a kilometer the aqueduct then joins the old canal which was constructed along the top of Salah ad-Din's city wall. This new system increased the amount of water brought to the Citadel, allowing al-Nasir Muhammad to carry out his major building projects in the Citadel, such as his mosque and the great palace known as the Qasr al-Ablaq (\\"Striped Palace\\"). = Later Mamluk restoration under al-Ghuri = In 1480, Sultan Qaytbay undertook major repairs on the aqueduct. More significantly, from 1506 to 1508 Sultan al-Ghuri embarked on a major overhaul of the aqueduct system. He expanded or rebuilt the water intake tower, increasing the number of waterwheels from 4 to 6, and placed his emblem on the tower's walls. The tall arched openings in the western sides of the tower, as seen today, are where the waterwheels were once located. At the top of the tower were other wheels which were turned by oxen to power the waterwheels below. Al-Ghuri also rebuilt many of the aqueduct's arches, and the section of aqueduct closest to the Nile is attributed to him. = The aqueduct after the Mamluk period = The aqueduct continued to be used during the Ottoman period, but fell into disuses during the French occupation of Egypt by Napoleon between 1798 and 1801 when the water intake tower was adapted for use by the French as a fort. The aqueduct system definitively stopped providing water to the Citadel in the 19th century, probably as late as 1872 when the Khalij canal was filled-up during the construction of the new \\"modern\\" Cairo under Khedive Isma'il. In the 20th century parts of the aqueduct were lost or destroyed due to disrepair and modern constructions; in particular, the final section of the aqueduct near the Citadel has disappeared.  The aqueduct in the present day  The water intake tower at Fumm el-Khalig, on the shores of the Nile. Much of the aqueduct's course, except for the section near the Citadel, can still be seen today, as can the massive hexagonal water intake tower from al-Ghuri's renovations. The monument has suffered from neglect and modern encroachments, but underwent some restoration and repairs in the 2000s. As of 2018, there are also plans to redevelop and refurbish the area around the aqueduct so as to highlight it as a heritage monument.

Climate Crystal Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.

It was in Southern Front when it was redesignated and was soon assigned to the 57th Army. It was encircled during the German counterattack in the Second Battle of Kharkov in May and its first commander was made a prisoner of war, later dying in German captivity. A cadre of the division managed to escape and was sent to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding. In July it joined the 63rd Army and took part in the attacks against the Italian 8th Army that created the bridgehead south of the Don River near Serafimovich during August. In October, now in 21st Army of Don Front, it was active in two probing attacks against the Romanian forces now containing the bridgehead which inflicted severe casualties in advance of the Soviet winter counteroffensive. At the start of that offensive the division was in 5th Tank Army, but was soon transferred to 1st Guards Army and then to the 3rd Guards Army when that was formed. It was under this Army as it advanced into the Donbass in late winter before returning to 57th Army during most of 1943, fighting through east Ukraine and across the lower Dniepr by the end of the year. After being briefly assigned to 53rd Army in December it was moved to 5th Guards Army in February, 1944 where it remained for the duration, mostly in the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps. It saw action in the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive and won its first decoration, the Order of the Red Banner, as it advanced, before being involved in the frustrating battles along the Dniestr River on the Romanian border. In late spring, 1944 the division was redeployed north becoming part of 1st Ukrainian Front and taking part in the Lvov‚ÄìSandomierz Offensive into Poland. The 14th Guards made a spectacular advance across Poland during the Vistula- Oder Offensive and was awarded the Order of Lenin for its part in the liberation of Sandomierz. On January 22, 1945 its commander suffered mortal wounds in the fighting for a bridgehead over the Oder River. In the drive on Berlin in April the division and its regiments won further honors and decorations but despite these distinctions it was disbanded in August, 1946. Formation The division was officially raised to Guards status on January 24, 1942 in recognition of its role in the first liberation of Rostov-on-Don on December 2, 1941. Its sub-units would not receive their Guards redesignations until February. The 96th had been originally formed as the 24th Rifle \\"Vinnitsa\\" Division in November, 1923 in recognition of where it was formed before being renumbered in May, 1924. In September, 1929 it added the honorific \\"in the name of Jan Fabricius\\".Fabricius, a Latvian national, was a senior commander of the Red Army in the Civil War. He was eventually awarded the Order of the Red Banner four times and died during a plane crash near Sochi on August 24, 1929. See: https://en.broadwayblogspot.com/4318-jan- fabricius-red-banner-punisher.html. When it became the 14th Guards it continued to carry these titles as parts of its official designation. In April, 1940 it had been converted to a mountain rifle division and although it is sometimes referred to as a regular rifle division from about October 1 onward in Soviet records it never officially had its designation changed prior to becoming a Guards unit.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Death\\", Soviet Mountain, Naval, NKVD, and Allied Divisions and Brigades 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. VII, Nafziger, 1995, p. 14 Its order of battle, based on the first wartime shtat (table of organization and equipment) for rifle divisions, while maintaining some of its mountain equipment (for example, 107mm mortars in place of 120mm mortars), was eventually as follows: * 36th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 43rd Mountain Rifle Regiment) * 38th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 209th Mountain Rifle Regiment) * 41st Guards Rifle Regiment (from 651st Mountain Rifle Regiment) * 33rd Guards Artillery Regiment (from 146th Mountain Artillery Regiment) * 6th Guards Antitank Battalion (from 63rd Antitank Battalion)Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", Soviet Guards Rifle and Airborne Units 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IV, Nafziger, 1995, p. 48.

Gen. Ivan Shepetov, who had led the 96th (Mountain) Rifle Division since 1940, remained in command.Glantz states that the division's (unnamed) prewar commander was killed in the Battle of Uman; David M. Glantz, Kharkov 1942, Ian Allan Publishing Ltd., Hersham, UK, 2010, p. 138. Commanders of Corps and Divisions (see Bibliography) lists Shepetov as the only wartime commander of the division's first formation. At the time it was redesignated the division was in 37th Army of Southern Front. During February it was transferred to 57th Army in the same Front which was well inside the salient created during the Barvenkovo‚ÄìLozovaya offensive which had recently ended.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, pp. 29, 48 Second Battle of Kharkov At the beginning of May 57th Army was still located in the southwest sector of the salient with its positions centered on Star Bliznetsy to the east of Lozovaya. 14th Guards constituted the Army reserve and had its main forces in the former town and one regiment in the latter. Southwestern Front launched an offensive to liberate Kharkov on May 12; Southern Front had no direct role in this even though the southern pincer of the offensive was being launched from the northwest sector of the salient. In the early going the attacking Soviet forces, Army Group Bobkin and 6th Army, made good progress in the direction of Krasnograd, reaching its outskirts by May 15. However the German Army Group South was planning its own operation to end the threat by cutting off the salient entirely; to this end it began regrouping mobile forces to its south, aiming at the 9th Army to the east of 57th Army. On the morning of May 17 the regrouping was complete and the German forces, led by the 14th and 16th Panzer Divisions, went over to the attack.Glantz, Kharkov 1942, pp. 190-91, 222, 231, 237-39 By 1700 hours the 14th Panzer had captured Barvenkovo. While 14th Guards covered the 57th Army's alternate command post at Star Bliznetsy, the main post was soon overrun. Due to the breakdown in communications the division received no orders to go into battle and remained in place all day, between 20 and 30km from the front line. Overall the German advance had torn 9th Army's defenses apart and left 57th Army in a grave position. It wasn't until the next morning that a directive was received for the division to move east and attack the left flank of the German penetration along with the 2nd Cavalry Corps. Late that day the commander of the Army, Lt. Gen. K. P. Podlas, was killed while leading some of his encircled troops, further worsening the command situation. At the same time the 14th Guards and 2nd Cavalry were fighting to contain the German attack along a line from Novo-Prigozhaia to Prigozhaia to Margaritovka. By midday on May 19 Marshal S. K. Timoshenko, commander of Southwestern Front, acknowledged that his offensive had failed and began moving the mobile forces of 6th Army against the breakthrough sector.Glantz, Kharkov 1942, pp. 240-41, 243-44, 254-58, 266 On May 20 the 14th Panzer continued its advance to the north against desperate resistance while the 16th Panzer and 60th Motorized Division struck east towards Lozovaya in an effort to encircle 57th Army. This forced 14th Guards back several kilometres but proved temporary as the German command decided to complete the encirclement of the entire salient instead. On the afternoon of May 22 14th Panzer linked up with the 44th Infantry Division of German 6th Army and this was achieved. The division began moving north in an effort to find an escape route, reaching the south end of the German corridor west of Marevka the next day. The Soviet front along the Donets was 40km away. The encircled forces formed a shock group from the 317th, 393rd and 150th Rifle Divisions, backed by cavalry and tanks, to make a breakthrough while the 14th Guards and remnants of several other divisions were to defend firmly to protect the shock group from the south and southwest. This disorganized effort began at 1000 hours on May 25 and while it made initial progress it soon ran into the 1st Mountain Division within the corridor and was badly shot up. Over the following days the main forces of the division were forced to the west and it's unknown how many of its men managed to break free. General Shepetov was severely wounded and captured near Izium after someone betrayed his location. He survived in the German Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp until May 21, 1943 when he was executed for anti-fascist agitation.Glantz, Kharkov 1942, pp. 275, 279, 282, 286-87, 291, 294, 297, 303 Operation Blue As of June 1 the remnants of 14th Guards were still in 57th Army,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 105 but required considerable rebuilding. Maj. Gen. Afanasy Gryaznov was appointed to command on the same day. By the beginning of July the division was in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in 5th Reserve Army,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 134 being brought back to strength as the German summer offensive unfolded. On July 12 the STAVKA ordered Southwestern Front to be renamed as Stalingrad Front and to have four armies incorporated into its forces, including the former 5th Reserve as 63rd Army. The orders continued: \\"Defend the eastern bank of the Don River with the 63rd Army in the sector it occupies and prevent the enemy from forcing the Don River under any circumstances.\\" The Army was to link its left flank to the 21st Army in the area of Serafimovich. It remained in this general situation at the start of August.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 186-87, 276 As the German 6th Army prepared to drive from the Don to Stalingrad the commander of Stalingrad Front, Col. Gen. A. I. Yeryomenko, issued orders on August 18/19 for a series of coordinated counterattacks by his armies to tie down German forces. 63rd Army was directed to advance from a 15km-wide sector west of the Khopyor River southwards across the Don towards Chebotarevskii, Klinovoi and Perelazovskii with 14th Guards and 197th Rifle Divisions with an immediate objective 15-20km south of the river. The attack began at dawn on August 20 and faced the Italian 2nd Infantry Division of 8th Army's XXXV Corps, which had only moved into the sector four days earlier. It gained immediate success and soon held a bridgehead 2-3km deep:Continuing their advance over the next two days the two attacking divisions were soon reinforced by 203rd Rifle Division and 21st Army's 304th Rifle Division. By then they had expanded their bridgehead to a depth of 2-10km, with 14th Guards at the deepest point, the village of Kotovsky. By the time the attack wound down on August 28 the combined Soviet assault force had carved a bridgehead 50km wide and up to 25km deep on the south bank of the Don.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 328-29, 383-89 In September Stalingrad Front was reorganized and 63rd Army was reassigned to the new Don Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 193 Between October 1 and 10 the German Army Group B moved all of Romanian 3rd Army into the defenses facing the Serafimovich bridgehead and the western end of the Kletskaya bridgehead. The commander of 3rd Army, Gen. P. Dumitrescu, sensed the threat posed by these bridgeheads and on September 24 had requested German backing to mount an offensive against them while his Army was still not completely committed. This request was turned down by the German high command, which did not want any resources diverted from the fighting in Stalingrad. In October the 14th Guards was transferred to 21st Army, now in Southwestern Front. Beginning on the night of October 13/14 the division, along with the 124th Rifle Division, began an intense probing attack against the Romanian forces which continued until the 16th, followed by another on its own overnight on October 19/20. The intention was to draw German forces away from Stalingrad but not incidentally these attacks, along with a third by 76th Rifle Division on October 24 - 27, inflicted 13,154 casualties on 3rd Army, roughly the equivalent of what the British 8th Army would suffer in the concurrent Second Battle of El Alamein.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 354, 775 =Operation Uranus= In the buildup to the Soviet counteroffensive against the German forces at Stalingrad the 14th Guards was again reassigned, now to the 5th Tank Army, which would be the main shock group of Southwestern Front. Before the main offensive began on November 19 all four of the Army's first-echelon rifle divisions conducted a reconnaissance-in-force with reinforced rifle battalions on the night of November 17/18. Overcoming Romanian forward security outposts and eliminating obstacles as they were encountered the division advanced nearly 2km into the positions of Romanian 9th Infantry Division to the southern slope of Hill 220 and the northern outskirts of State Farm (Sovkhoz) No. 3. This reconnaissance was effective in uncovering and removing minefields and other engineering works and identified many strongpoints in the main defensive line as well as weak spots.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book One, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 59, 89, 186-87 When the true offensive began the 14th Guards manned security positions in a 15km-wide sector, concealing the forward deployment of the 47th Guards and 119th Rifle Divisions into their jumping-off positions for the assault. The division had four tank destroyer regiments attached to support and protect its advance and there was a total of 138 tanks in the bridgehead in the infantry support role. It was on the Army's right (west) flank in much the same positions it had won in August. The attack began between 0848 and 0850 hours Moscow time and during the first hour the rifle divisions overcame the Romanian first defensive positions with relative ease. Following this the 14th Guards found the going much more difficult. With no armor support the division's multiple assaults were broken up by intense flanking artillery, mortar and machine gun fire from a Romanian strongpoint on Hill 228, 4km northwest of Sovkhoz No. 3. The commander of 1st Guards Army to the west attempted to assist with an attack by his 203rd Rifle Division but this failed in the face of determined resistance by the Romanian 11th Infantry Division. By now Romanian resistance was stiffening throughout 5th Tank's sector, evidence that the artillery preparation had not been as effective as planned.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book One, pp. 192-95, 201-03, 243 By noon the commander of 5th Tank, Lt. Gen. P. L. Romanenko, decided that if the offensive was to succeed he would have to commit his 1st and 26th Tank Corps. These corps stepped off at 1400 hours, east of the 14th Guards' sector, and effectively obliterated two regiments of the Romanian 14th Infantry Division. While two regiments of the division remained stalled in front of the Romanian defenses, its left-wing regiment managed to exploit the tank-assisted success of 47th Guards with an advance of up to 2km. Over the course of the next day the division continued to slowly move ahead as 9th Romanian refused its right flank to the west and 47th Guards and 8th Cavalry Corps exploited into the gap in the Romanian defenses. The Romanian resistance was so stout that Romanenko was forced to commit his reserve 159th Rifle Division to the fight. In addition a desperate counterattack by the 9th and elements of the 11th Romanian Divisions compelled Romanenko to further reinforce his flank with the 21st Cavalry Division of 8th Cavalry Corps; this reinforced Soviet grouping, supported by a handful of tanks from 1st Tank Corps, forced the two Romanian divisions to withdraw.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book One, pp. 208-11, 214, 230, 236, 244-45 On November 21, as most of Romanian 3rd Army was being encircled between 5th Tank and 21st Armies the 14th Guards, along with its reinforcements, continued to push the 9th Romanian west and southwest toward the Krivaia River. In the course of this the 21st Cavalry, many mounted on tanks, overran the headquarters of the Romanian division. Farther to the right the 14th Guards got into its stride, crushing the Romanians' right wing 12-14km east of Verkhnyi Gorbatovsky. The division encircled and captured most of a Romanian infantry regiment during the day, pursuing its remnants and liberating the village before nightfall. The next day General Romanenko was ordered to transfer the division and its supporting artillery to the 1st Guards Army effective on November 23. During the day it conducted local attacks and raids east of the Krivaia in cooperation with the 203rd and 278th Rifle Divisions, penetrating the defenses of the Romanian 9th and 11th Divisions and liberating the towns of Dubovskoi, Rubashkin, Bakhmutkin and Yagodnyi on the Krivaia, 50-55km west-southwest of Serafimovich.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book One, pp. 278-79, 308, 315 Late on the same day forces of the Southwestern and Stalingrad Fronts met and sealed the encirclement of the German forces at Stalingrad. 1st Guards Army set out to encircle and destroy the Romanian 7th and 11th Divisions on November 24, which were defending a wedge of territory between the Don and Krivaia Rivers. The 14th Guards and 203rd Divisions were tasked with attacking westward across the Krivaia on a 6km-wide sector from Gorbatovskaia to Ushakov against the 11th Romanian. At about midday the 266th Rifle Division was ordered into the boundary between the two divisions to fend off any German counterattacks that might materialize. Although most of the attack failed to develop as planned, the division, reinforced by the 266th during the day, penetrated the Romanian defenses and during the day advanced westward up to 16km. By nightfall General Gryaznov reported that his division \\"attacked the enemy along the 2nd Section State Farm - Ilin - Dulensky line and advanced from 5-16 kilometres, reaching the Konkov, Vislogubov, and Nizhnye Luchki line before being halted.\\" However, Gen. K. A. Hollidt, commander of the German XVII Army Corps, soon dispatched his 62nd and 294th Infantry Divisions with orders to reinforce the Romanians and drive the Soviet forces back across the Krivaia. The next day the 159th Rifle Division of 5th Tank Army moved to tie in closely to the left flank of 14th Guards. The German counterstroke began on November 27 and was successful; the 14th Guards was forced back across the Krivaia.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book One, pp. 395-96, 426, 432-33, 472-73 =Operation Little Saturn= As the Axis defenses along the Krivaia and Chir rivers crystalized the Soviet command was forced to reassess its plans. 1st Guards Army had been earmarked for Operation Saturn, which had been intended to destroy the entire Axis position in the Caucasus region. Now circumstances, including the sheer size of the German force encircled at Stalingrad, required a change in plans. On the morning of December 5 the 1st Guards was split with its eastern half, including 14th Guards, becoming the new 3rd Guards Army.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 20-21, 25 Several days earlier the division had been subordinated to the 14th Rifle Corps along with the 203rd Division.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 238 The operation, which would also include the 6th Army of Voronezh Front, targeted the German XVII Corps, the weakened divisions of Romanian I Corps and the bulk of Italian 8th Army.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, p. 25 The offensive began on December 16 and the 14th Guards, supported by the 114th Separate Tank Regiment and leading the 1st Guards Mechanized Corps, crashed through the defenses of the German 294th Infantry at Astskhov. Although Army Group Don recorded that the Soviet force lost 17 tanks destroyed and four damaged, it also admitted that \\"the heights from east of Kriuscha Tal [gorge] to Hill 156 are in enemy hands.\\"Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, pp. 233-35 The German division brought up reserves which stalled further advance that day, but on the 17th the 1st Guards Mechanized was committed to complete the breakthrough. This was successful, and allowed the division to re-occupy Dulensky by the end of the day. On December 18 the two Soviet units, now joined by 203rd Division, continued to attack and by the end of the day recaptured Konkov, ans well as Bokovskaya and Staryi Zemtsov, which broke the last German fortified line. Over three days the Soviet grouping had advanced 15-20km and began to pursue the German 294th and 62nd Divisions, plus the Romanian 7th and 11th, striving to complete their encirclement and destruction in the Kruzhilin area. During the day of December 19 the 14th Rifle and 1st Guards Mechanized Corps, advancing from the south, met the 197th Rifle Division advancing from the north in the Kruzhilin area, completing 3rd Guards Army's immediate task. However on the previous day and overnight the Axis managed to pull out a significant portion of its forces from the pocket and consolidate along the south bank of the Chir. The 3rd Guards commander, Lt. Gen. D. D. Lelyushenko, was ordered to immediately turn the Army's main forces to the south and organize an unremitting pursuit.Soviet General Staff, Rollback, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, Kindle ed., Part II, ch. 1 Into Ukraine On December 21 General Gryasnov took over command of the 14th Rifle Corps while remaining in command of the 14th Guards. On January 24, 1943 he was given command of the 15th Rifle Corps and handed the division over to Col. Vladimir Rusakov. By the beginning of February the 3rd Guards Army held a bridgehead over the Northern Donets River south of Voroshilovgrad from which it broke out in a drive to liberate that city.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2011, pp. 135-37 In the plan for the offensive the 14th Rifle Corps (now consisting of the 14th and 61st Guards Rifle Divisions) was not part of the Army's shock group but was instead to reach a line from Georgievskoe to Orekhova to Semeikino to guard its flank from any attack from the southwest. By February 4 the 14th Corps, supported by the 169th Tank Brigade, was operating in the area of heights 207, 202.8 and 206.9. Two days later German forces counterattacked the 61st Guards but were repelled; on February 7 a more powerful attack was made by elements of the 3rd SS Panzer Division supported by 40 tanks which broke through the Soviet front and captured Orlovka, Belo-Skelevatyi and Nizhnii and Verkhnii Gabun. This attack brought the advance on Voroshilovgrad to a halt.Soviet General Staff, Rollback, Kindle ed., Part V, ch. 1 After regrouping his Army General Lelyushenko decided to go over to a decisive offensive on the morning of February 12 to take Voroshilovgrad and subsequently carry out the Army's main task of reaching the Stalino - Ordzhonikidze area. East of the Luganchik River at 0500 hours the 61st Guards' 558th Rifle Regiment, with the 14th Guards' training battalion and two battalions of the 229th Rifle Brigade, defeated the German garrisons in Orlovka and Belo-Skelevatyi. Simultaneously Popovka was seized by the main body of the division, backed by support elements of the 14th Corps, and continued advancing, reaching the Lutugino area by the end of February 14. That morning other units of the 3rd Guards Army, chiefly the 59th Guards and 243rd Rifle Divisions and elements of 2nd Tank Corps, had cleared the city.Soviet General Staff, Rollback, Kindle ed., Part V, ch. 1 After this victory the 3rd Guards and 5th Tank Armies pressed on towards Stalino, but on February 20 the German 4th and 1st Panzer Armies began the counteroffensive that would become the Third Battle of Kharkov. While this was primarily aimed at Voronezh Front, Southwestern Front also faced attacks and the overall crisis made any further Soviet advance impossible.John Erickson, The Road to Berlin, Weidenfeld and Nicolson Ltd., London, UK, 1983, pp. 49-54 =Battle of the Dniepr= In April the 14th Guards returned to 57th Army, still in Southwestern Front, where it came under the 27th Guards Rifle Corps. In July that Corps was moved to 6th Army in the same Front. In August the division was once again assigned to 57th Army, this time to the 64th Rifle Corps; the Army was now part of Steppe Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 113, 196, 224 Under these headquarters it took part in the Poltava-Kremenchug Offensive beginning on August 26. Colonel Rusakov was replaced in command by Col. Georgii Pavlovich Slatov on September 9. On September 25 the division reached the Dniepr River and the 11th Guards Reconnaissance Company (which was now motorized) forced a crossing under German fire near the village of Pushkarevka which is now part of the city of Verkhnodniprovsk. In recognition of their gallantry, five men of the company were made Heroes of the Soviet Union on December 20.See External links =First Jassy-Kishinev Offensive= In October the division left 64th Corps to come under direct command of 57th Army in the 2nd Ukrainian (former Steppe) Front, while a month later it moved to direct Front control.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 280, 309 In December it was again reassigned, now to 53rd Army's 48th Rifle Corps in the same Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 18 At this time the division's personnel were noted as being roughly 50 percent Russian and 50 percent of several Asian nationalities.Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 595 On January 29, 1944 Colonel Slatov handed the division over to Col. Vikentii Vasilevich Skryganov; this officer would be promoted to the rank of major general on September 13. In February the 48th Corps was transferred to 5th Guards Army of the same Front and in March the 14th Guards was reassigned to 33rd Guards Rifle Corps;Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 76, 106 the division would remain in this Army for the duration of the war. During the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive the division took part in the liberation of Novoukrainka on March 17 for which it was decorated on March 29 with the Order of the Red Banner. By mid-April the 5th Guards Army was approaching the Dniestr River in the vicinity of Grigoriopol. 33rd Guards Corps (14th Guards, 9th Guards Airborne and 214th Rifle Divisions) was on the Army's right (north) flank; the Army was on the far left flank of its Front. The Army commander, Lt. Gen. Aleksey Zhadov, had already ordered the Corps to force a crossing of the Dniestr and develop its offensive towards Cimi»ôeni. The Corps faced defenses manned by the German 4th Mountain Division of XXXX Panzer Corps.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2007, pp. 89-91 The Army began crossing operations, mostly using improvised means, immediately upon reaching the east bank of April 12. The first across was a regiment of 95th Guards Rifle Division of 32nd Guards Rifle Corps. 33rd Guards Corps was intended to cross further north, closer to Gigoriopol but all three divisions were unsuccessful overnight on April 12/13. On April 13 and 14 the remainder of 32nd Guards Corps crossed into the 95th Guards' bridgehead and expanded it by capturing the village of PuhƒÉceni and the town of Speia. General Zhadov ordered 33rd Guards Corps into the bridgehead as well, which was completed by the end of April 16. The bridgehead was now about 12km wide and 8km deep and engineering efforts across the river had allowed Zhadov to move tanks and other heavy weapons into it so offensive operations could be resumed in the direction of Chi»ôinƒÉu. 33rd Guards Corps was in the northern half of the bridgehead with the 14th Guards tying in to 32nd Guards Corps to its south.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, pp. 92-95 Zhadov launched his attack at dawn on April 16 after a two-hour artillery and airstrike preparation; 14th Guards was in the second echelon. After about two hours of fighting the first echelon divisions with armor support overpowered the German 320th Infantry Division's forward security belt and by 0930 hours had torn a hole up to 2km wide and 3km deep in the German defenses. The most significant gains were made in a sector 3-6km south of the village of DelacƒÉu where the German second defensive position was breached up to 2km deep. However at 1030 hours the German forces replied with their own intense artillery fire and airstrikes and a wave of counterattacks that halted 5th Guards Army in its tracks. Further attacks at 1500 hours by 4th Mountain and 294th Infantry and 13th Panzer Divisions did considerable damage to 95th and 13th Guards Divisions. When the fighting finally died down late on April 17 both sides were thoroughly exhausted and the 5th Guards was back to its starting point. A renewed attack on the 18th, which likely had 14th Guards in the first echelon, made no progress. The bridgehead was reinforced over the following days and a new effort was mounted on April 25 and this time expanded the area of the bridgehead by about one-third; 33rd Guards Corps had advanced 8-10km by May 6. By now it was clear that no successful advance on Chi»ôinƒÉu would be made on this axis and 5th Guards was replaced in the bridgehead by 8th Guards Army while the former was redeployed to the northwest for a new assault on Ia»ôi in mid-May.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, pp. 95-100 The handover did not go smoothly as the German 6th Army launched new attacks on the bridgehead as it was happening and many of 5th Guards' rifle divisions had to withdraw under enemy fire. Ultimately the Army did not begin concentrating northeast of Ia»ôi until May 15 and did not complete the process until the first week of June. This delay, among other events, forced the STAVKA to postpone and later cancel the entire operation.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, p. 327 Meanwhile the commander of 2nd Ukrainian Front, Marshal I. S. Konev, was transferred to command of 1st Ukrainian Front on May 24. In June the 5th Guards Army was moved to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and by the beginning of July it was under command of the same Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 207, 225 The 14th Guards would remain in this Front for the duration. Into Poland and Germany About the beginning of August the personnel of the division were noted as being 25 percent Russian, 50 percent Ukrainian, 15 percent Moldovan, and 10 percent several Asian nationalities.Glantz, Colossus Reborn, p. 595 Under 1st Ukrainian Front the division took part in the Lvov‚ÄìSandomierz Offensive. In early August the 5th Guards Army entered the bridgehead over the Vistula that had been created by the 6th Guards Tank Corps near Baran√≥w Sandomierski. In September the division was moved to the 101st Rifle Corps of 38th Army in the same Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 287 It was under these commands when the bridgehead was hit by heavy German counterattacks from October 14-18. In the Draganovo and Palatsuvka region for a short time the German forces managed to encircle several Soviet divisions including the 14th Guards. During its escape the division destroyed 22 enemy guns, 40 mortars, 125 machine guns, while killing up to 2,000 German soldiers and officers and capturing another 27. During the five-day battle the division lost 770 men killed and 2,590 wounded.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, ed. and trans. D. M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishers, London, UK, 1998, pp. 168-69 Later that month the division returned to its previous corps and army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 318 1st Ukrainian Front launched its part of the Vistula-Oder Offensive on January 12, 1945. On the first day the 14th Guards broke through the entire depth of the German defenses west of Sandomierz and continued to advance through Poland for the next 11 days, covering 265km during that time, killing 1,360 German officers and men and destroying or capturing 17 tanks, 60 guns or mortars, 105 machine guns and 178 motor vehicles. On the night of January 21/22 the division crossed the Oder River off the march 16km northwest of Oppeln.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=8020. In Russian, English translation available. Retrieved November 12, 2019.

On the same date the 33rd Guards Artillery Regiment received the Order of the Red Banner and the 41st Guards Rifle was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 3rd Degree, both for their successes in the fighting for Silesia. The 33rd Guards Artillery and the 38th Guards Rifle were further granted \\"Wis≈Ça\\" as a battle honor while the 36th Guards Rifle received \\"Silesia\\" as the same. =Lower Silesian Offensive= Following the death of General Skryganov the division would be commanded by a succession of colonels: Aleksey Yakovlevich Goryachev (January 26 - March 14); Sigismund Adolfovich Losik-Savitzkii (March 15 - April 20); and Pavel Ivanovich Sikorsky (April 21 - May 11). Beginning on February 8 the 5th Guards Army took part in the Front's Lower Silesian Offensive with its main objective of encircling the German garrison of Breslau. On its sector the offensive was based on the bridgehead seized by 14th Guards in January. The German defense was based on the 269th Infantry Division with several battlegroups, five independent battalions, two panzer battalions and an NCO school. The Army's attack was led by 32nd Guards Rifle Corps and developed slowly over the first three days in large part due to the large number of fortified villages to be overcome and the ammunition shortage faced by all Soviet forces after the breakneck advance through Poland. On February 11 Marshal Konev shifted the 31st Tank Corps from 21st Army and committed it on the sector of 33rd Guards Corps the next day with the immediate objective of capturing the Bogenau area.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 424-25 On February 13 the Army's offensive developed more successfully than in the preceding days. German resistance did not abate and if anything increased as further forces entered the Breslau area but despite this the 4th Guards and 31st Tank Corps linked up with the 7th Guards Mechanized Corps of 6th Army to complete the encirclement. Konev chose to leave 6th Army to maintain the siege while the 32nd and 33rd Guards Corps of 5th Guards Army were ordered to make a decisive attack from the Magnitz area toward Koberwitz and then to the southwest. The former Corps was reinforced with the 14th Guards, whose former sector was taken over by forces from 21st Army. During the fighting on February 15 the width of the cordon between Breslau and the main German forces was increased to up to 13km. By the end of February 17 the 32nd Guards Corps had arrived in the Liegnitz area, relieving the 3rd Guards Tank Army's 9th Mechanized Corps which then undertook a forced night march which brought it to Bober River in the Lewenberg area.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, pp. 426, 428-29, 442-43 By the beginning of March the division had returned to 33rd Guards Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, p. 87 =Berlin Operation= Prior to the start of the Berlin offensive the 14th Guards was again reassigned within 5th Guards Army, now to the 34th Guards Rifle Corps where it joined the 15th and 58th Guards Rifle Divisions. The Army was deployed along the eastern bank of the Neisse River on a 13km front and planned to launch its main attack with its right wing on the 8km sector from Gross Saerchen to Muskau. 34th Guards Corps was in the first echelon with its divisions in a single echelon, but the 14th Guards was not on the attack sector. When the offensive began on April 16 the Army's main forces crossed the Neisse under the cover of massed artillery fire. The first task of 34th Guards Corps was to eliminate a German bridgehead on the eastern bank in the Muskau area. This done, the 15th and 58th Guards Divisions advanced as much as 6km into the German defenses on the west bank. Early the next day the 15th Guards helped clear the passage of the 14th Guards by advancing into the rear of the German forces it was facing.Soviet General Staff, The Berlin Operation 1945, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, Kindle ed., chs. 11, 13 By April 22 the 5th Guards Army was pursuing defeated German forces to the west, destroying rearguards and advancing 30km during the day. 14th Guards was in part responsible for securing the Army's left flank which had grown to almost 100km in length and was holding along a line from Broten to Wittichenau to Buchwalde with its front facing south. Over the next two days a German force based on elements of 17th and 4th Panzer Armies launched a counteroffensive which broke through the 52nd Army's front along its boundary with the 2nd Polish Army and continued north in the general direction of Spremberg. To counter this effort, Konev ordered Zhadov to use the 33rd Guards Corps and the 14th Guards to attack towards Losa and Ugist (north of Bautzen) and reestablish contact with the Poles. This effort brought the German attack to a halt by the end of April 24. On the next day the 58th Guards Division joined hands with the U.S. 69th Infantry Division at Torgau.Soviet General Staff, The Berlin Operation 1945, Kindle ed., ch. 16 On April 26 Zhadov ordered the 14th Guards to capture Kamenz and link up its left flank to the Polish Army. Fighting continued in this area through April 27-30 with no significant changes in the situation until the German grouping was completely worn out and went over to the defense.Soviet General Staff, The Berlin Operation 1945, Kindle ed., ch. 19 During this period the division returned to 33rd Guards Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, p. 160 From May 6-11 it took part, with the rest of 1st Ukrainian Front, in the final offensive on Prague. Postwar At the time of the German surrender the division carried the official title 14th Guards Rifle, Vinnitsa, Order of Lenin, Order of the Red Banner, in the name of Jan Fabricius Division.

Biography  Tabouret received her B.F.A. from the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris, in 2006 and studied at Cooper Union, New York, in 2005 as part of a study exchange program. Tabouret's most famous series may be her 'Makeup' (2015-ongoing) which depicts young women and girls with their faces smeared with cosmetics. The smeared makeup references a child's first attempts at painting. In 2017, Tabouret exhibited alongside Yoko Ono in the exhibit 'One Day I Broke a Mirror' at Villa De Medici. For the exhibit, she made paintings of groups of women, seated and looking forward, described as warriors, adventuresses, and conquerors.

Twice crippled by explosions he was said to be very disfigured and looked \\"prematurely aged\\". Life He was born on 7 January 1804 in a cottage on the estate of Upper (or Over) Rankeilour House in the parish of Monimail in central Fife. He was the eldest son of Alexander Bethune (d.1838), a farm labourer and weaver, and his wife Alison Christie (d.1840). He was the elder brother of John Bethune.ODNB: John Bethune In 1813 the family moved to Lochend Farm near Lindores Loch in the parish of Abdie. In 1822 he was employed alongside his brother breaking rocks to create a new toll road in Fife from Lindores to Newburgh. He returned again to labouring after his weaving venture collapsed in 1825. Mainly working in quarrying and road-building ne was blown up in a quarry explosion in 1829 and not expected to live. He recovered and returned to the same line of work. Ironically an almost identical circumstance recurred in 1832 and he was left physically disfigured and crippled by the second explosion.http://sandy1.users.50megs.com/travel-bethune-cottage.html He lost one eye and was temporarily blinded in the other. The man he was with was killed.Tales of the Scottish Peasantry -prologue In 1830 he began writing poetry and was published in local newspapers in their \\"Poets Corner\\". In 1838 he went to Edinburgh and persuaded the publisher Andrew Shortrede who had a printworks on Thistle Street, to publish \\"Tales and Sketches of Scottish Poetry\\" which proved an instant success.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1838 However, Shortrede did the better of the two as he acquired the full copyright in exchange for the price of the first 50 copies sold (probably around 50 shillings).ODNB: Alexander Bethune The family were forced to leave Lochend farm in 1839 following the death of his father. They moved slightly north to a cottage in Newburgh, Fife which is said to be built by the brothers (but this is unlikely as they needed accommodation immediately). The house is now called \\"Bethune Cottage\\". Given their financial position it is likely that (if they lived here at all) that it was in a single room. His mother died soon after the move. It is not clear if John died before or after the move. Alexander published John's poems just after his death and the sold the whole first issue of 750 copies within a few weeks.ODNB: Alexander Bethune A fan, Mrs Hill, wife of Frederick Hill, HM Inspector of Prisons, heard of his financial predicament and obtained him a job as a turnkey (prison warder) in Glasgow in 1840, but he despised the job and resigned in March 1841. In 1842 he returned to Edinburgh to agree publishing rights of his next book, \\"The Scottish Peasants Fireside\\". He avoided Shortrede and instead asked Adam Black (later the Lord Provost) of Adam And Charles Black on 27 North Bridge to publish his work.Edinburgh Post Office directory 1842 Early in 1843 he was offered the editorship of the newspaper the \\"Dumfries Standard\\" but did not live to take the post. He died of consumption (tuberculosis) (possibly contracted from John in 1839) on 13 June 1843 at Newburgh in Fife.

He was also an aviator, fencing contractor, inventor, labourer, mailman and miner and known a \\"true son of the Red Centre\\", referring to the southern desert region of the Northern Territory in Australia.  Early life  Johannsen was born at Deep Well Station, 80kms south of Alice Springs, to Gerhardt and Ottilie Johannsen. Gerhardt had emigrated from Denmark and Ottilie was of German descent and the family often experienced discrimination throughout Kurt's childhood, the period in between the two World Wars, and Gerhardt was often referred to as \\"The German\\" or \\"The Hun\\". In 1922, when Johannsen was 7, the family moved to Hermannsburg Mission Station where Gerhardt worked as the station manager; this was following the sudden death of Pastor Carl Strehlow in October 1922. The family remained there until 1924 before returning to Deep Well. However, in Deep Well, all was not well with Central Australia being in the midst of a harsh drought and both of his parents experiencing ill health, so, in 1928, the family abandoned the station and moved in to Alice Springs, which was then called Stuart.  Working life  Johannsen acquired his first driving license at 11 when living at Deep Well and, after finishing his schooling at 15 in Alice Springs, he was driving his own truck and held the government contract for sanitary and garbage services in the town; as he was underage this contract was cosigned by his father and brother-in-law Bill Petrick. In 1932 he took on an additional contract as a mail contractor for the region east of Alice Springs and the mail run extended to: Alcoota, Ambalindum, Arltunga, Claraville, Delny, MacDonald Downs, Mount Riddock, Mount Swan, Waite River and Winnecke. One story told about Johannsen around this period is that he once broke an axle when far from assistance and managed to fix it well enough to get back to town using a mulga tree and a knife. Over the following years Johannsen had many roles and was involved in many exploits before, in 1936, starting on his most remembered innovation, the 'Bitzer' Mulga Express which was designed to be able to haul more as well as handle the bad roads around Central Australia; and, in the early years, was quite an unexpected sight. Over the following years the 'Bitzer' Mulga Express was followed by the 'Bitzer' Mulga Express II and III, the 'Bitzer' Mulga Express III was able to haul an unheard of 22 tonnes. Between mail runs and driving his truck Johannsen prospected extensively and was also involved in various tourism ventures with Australian Expeditions (with Monty Embury) and Bond's Tours. During World War II Johannsen moved to Tennant Creek and opened a garage where he created a wood- gas producer that converted wood into gas to run the motor; it consumed about 1 kg of wood for every km. The post-war period was one of boom for Johannsen who was able to purchase many trucks and other mechanical items from army disposal sales and with these vehicles was able to construct the world's first road train, with three self tracking trailers, using a Diamond T980 truck. These trucks were then used for all kinds of freight but were especially useful for cattle transport which changed the way farming was done as truck transport was better for stock then droving and the cattle arrived in the yards in better condition and therefore fetched higher prices; this also meant that younger cattle could be sold.  Later life  Johannsen retired from mining and transporting in 1980 and purchased a small hobby farm in Yankalilla, South Australia. In 1992 he published his autobiography: \\"A son of 'the red centre': memoirs and anecdotes of the life of a road train pioneer and bush inventor of the Northern Territory of Australia\\". Johannsen was inducted into the Shell Rimula Wall of Fame in 2000. He passed away on 23 January 2002.

Korean Air Flight 801 Korean Air Flight 801 (KE801, KAL801) was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by Korean Air. The flight crashed on August 6, 1997, on approach to Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport, in the United States territory of Guam, killing 228 of the 254 people aboard. The aircraft crashed on Nimitz Hill in Asan, Guam, while on approach to the airport. The National Transportation Safety Board cites poor communication between the flight crew as probable cause for the crash, along with the captain‚Äôs poor decision making on the non-precision approach. Flying Tiger Line Flight 66 Flying Tiger Line Flight 66 was a scheduled international cargo flight from Singapore Changi Airport, in Changi, Singapore, to Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport in the Kowloon Peninsula via a stopover at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (now Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport), in Subang, Selangor, near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. On February 19, 1989, the FedEx-owned Boeing 747-249F-SCD crashed while on its final approach to Kuala Lumpur. The aircraft impacted a hillside 437 feet above sea level and 12 kilometers (6.5 nautical miles) from the airport, resulting in all four crew members being killed. Air New Zealand Flight 901 Air New Zealand Flight 901 (TE-901) was a scheduled Air New Zealand Antarctic sightseeing flight that operated between 1977 and 1979. The flight would leave Auckland Airport in the morning and spend a few hours flying over the Antarctic continent, before returning to Auckland in the evening via Christchurch. On 28 November 1979, the fourteenth flight of TE-901, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, registration ZK-NZP, flew into Mount Erebus on Ross Island, Antarctica, killing all 237 passengers and 20 crew on board. The accident became known as the Mount Erebus disaster. The initial investigation concluded the accident was caused by pilot error, but public outcry led to the establishment of a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the crash. The commission, presided over by Justice Peter Mahon QC, concluded that the accident was caused by a correction made to the coordinates of the flight path the night before the disaster, coupled with a failure to inform the flight crew of the change, with the result that the aircraft, instead of being directed by computer down McMurdo Sound (as the crew had been led to believe), was instead re-routed to a path toward Mount Erebus. Justice Mahon's report accused Air New Zealand of presenting \\"an orchestrated litany of lies\\" and this led to changes in senior management at the airline. The accident is New Zealand's deadliest peacetime disaster, as well as the deadliest accident in the history of Air New Zealand.

The island has also been known as Da'anshan () and the nearby Tongpan Island as Xiao'anshan (). The southern part of the island is crossed by the Tropic of Cancer. Hujing Island is the seventh largest island in Penghu (the Pescadores). The island is from Penghu Main Island. There are mountains on the eastern end (Dongshan) and western end (Sishan) of the island. Ferries run three times a day between Magong on the main island of Penghu and Hujing Island. It takes about twenty minutes to reach Hujing Island from Penghu's main island by boat. History Map of Penghu (the Pescadores) including Hujing Island (labeled as Groote Taaffel) (circa 1726) Map of Hujing Island (labeled as Kosei-t≈ç) and surrounding area (1944) Map including Hujing Island (labeled as Hu-ching hs√º (Kosei-sho) ) (1950) The island takes its current name from a tradition in which a tiger was found in a dry cave (or well) near the south end of the island. According to tradition, the Dutch built a fortress on the island which sank into the sea. No significant discoveries have been made in the area. On July 12, 1683, Qing Empire naval forces took Hujing Island and Tongpan Island in the early stages of the Battle of Penghu. A World War II-era Japanese bomb shelter built on the island survives and is accessible to the public free of charge. In January 2019, there were noted complaints about collapsing roads and slow repair times around the western mountain area of the island. In June 2019, there were a total of six students in the island's primary school. Geography The population of Hujing (Huching) village, noted for its seafood restaurants, is concentrated on the southwest end of the island.

History and Influences  Hermannsburg has a strong history with many artistic successes and it is one of the birthplaces of contemporary Aboriginal art. One of the first western artists to visit the Hermannsburg Community was Violet Teauge, who came to raise money for the Kuprilya Springs Pipeline, and she was followed soon after by Rex Battarbee who encouraged and supported Albert Namatjira, in internationally successful artist from the community, who was the beginning of the watercolour art movement in Hermannsburg. Both the Hermannsburg Potters and the Iltja Ntjarra (Many Hands) Art Centre are influenced by this movement. Pastor Albrecht, a Lutheran missionary, who worked at Hermannsburg from 1926 - 1952, actively encouraged the development of the arts industry as a means for the community to make money; especially in the 1930s when a number of tourists started visiting the community. The Hermannsburg Potters, which is women's only, are a more recent artistic incarnation in the community and it was started when, in 1990, senior law man Nashasson Ungwanaka invited an accomplished ceramicist Naomi Sharp to come and teach. The first small exhibition was held in Alice Springs in August 1991.  Technique  Aboriginal people are intrinsically linked to and inseparable from their land, and clay is an important part of this as it is a \\"part of the skin of the earth itself\\". Using this, almost sacred, clay the Hermannsburg Potters were able to create a distinctive style using the traditional hand-coil technique, and the lids support distinctive colourful sculpted animal, birds, bush tucker and aspects of community life.  Artists  Elaine Namatjira, granddaughter of Albert Namatjira, was one of the leading artists. Her work influenced her nephew, Vincent Namatjira. , senior artists at Hermannsburg Potters include: * Anita Ratara Mbitjana * Dawn Wheeler Ngala * Hayley Coulthard Pangangka * Irene Entata Mbitjana * Judith Inkamala Pungkarta * Lindy Rontji Pangangka * Rahel Ungwanaka Kngwarria * Rone Rubuntja Panangka * Sonia Davis  References  Category:Australian potters Category:Northern Territory ","title":"Hermannsburg Potters"},{"id":"62222956","text":"Angelika Gl√∂ckner (born February 5, 1962 in Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate) is a German politician (SPD) and a member of the German Bundestag since 2014.

Wat Thep Sirin Subdistrict () is a khwaeng (subdistrict) of Pom Prap Sattru Phai District, Bangkok. History Wat Thep Sirin (sometimes written as Wat Debsirin), is a royal temple named in honour of Queen Debsirindra, wife of King Mongkut (Rama IV) and mother of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V). The area originally was known as Suan Mali (‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏°‡∏∞‡∏•‡∏¥, 'jasmine garden') and \\"Rong Liang Dek\\" (‡πÇ‡∏£‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏î‡πá‡∏Å, 'child care house').

Rong Liang Dek was the first nursery in Thailand, it was founded in 1890 by Princess Saisavali Bhiromya, the royal consort of King Chulalongkorn, following the loss of her eldest daughter (Princess Nabhachara Chamrassri) at the age of five years to typhoid in 1889. She established the nursery to adopt orphans north of Suan Mali. After it opened, she named all children herself, before whose names she prefixed the word Bun ('good deed'). The nursery was demolished, but its name still appears as a soi ('alleyway') on left side of Bamrung Mueang Road called Soi Rong Liang Dek or Trok Rong Liang Dek as it is in the area of Khlong Maha Nak Subdistrict. In 1940, Suan Mali and Rong Liang Dek were merged with Wat Thep Sirin.

She was a native of Trent or possibly Arco. In a deposition taken in Bologna on 22 September 1304, Rolandino, one of the Apostles, described Margaret as from Trent and a companion of Dolcino for the past year. In 1302‚Äì1303, according to Rolandino, Dolcino had been accompanied on his preaching tour of the Trentino by Cara da Modena, a woman and fellow preacher. In Dolcino's second letter of December 1303, however, he lists the leaders of his movement in order of precedence with himself first as rector (leader) and his sister Margaret second as \\"his beloved above all\\". They are followed by the brothers Longino da Bergamo, Alberto da Cimego, Baldrico da Brescia and Federico Grampa di Novara. The same hierarchy is described as current by Rolandino in his deposition. Margaret's rise to prominence appears to have been rapid, given the presence of another woman, Cara, beside Dolcino earlier in the year. It is not know if the choice of a woman as his companion had significance to the movement or was merely coincidental. No other women leaders are known among the Apostles. The inquisitor Bernard Gui accuses Margaret of being Dolcino's concubine (amasia), but his accusation is of little worth on its own. He also calls Margaret \\"his partner in crime and heresy\\" and a \\"mischievous woman\\". He admits that Dolcino denies any physical relationship, claiming that he treated Margaret \\"in the manner of a sister in Christ, modestly and honestly\\". According to Gui, when Margaret became pregnant Dolcino claimed that she was impregnated by the Holy Spirit. Gui heightens the implausibility of Dolcino's claim by describing Margaret, in Italian in an otherwise Latin text, as \\"the beauty\\" (la bella), a description picked up by the anonymous Historia fratris Dulcini and by Benvenuto da Imola, who writes of her \\"immense beauty\\". In 1306, Pope Clement V declared a crusade against the followers of Fra Dolcino, who took refuge in the Val Sesia. On 23 March 1307, Raniero Avogadro, bishop of Vercelli, led the final attack on the New Apostles. Dolcino, Margaret and Longino were captured. They were brought to Biella on 25 March. After a secular trial by a council of wise men, according to the Historia fratris Dulcini, they were burned at the stake on the banks of the Cervo near Vercelli on 1 June 1307. Margaret was burned first before Dolcino's eyes. Gui gives a slightly different account. He has Margaret torn to pieces before Dolcino's eyes before the latter met the same fate. Their dismembered corpses were then cremated. On 31 December 1332, Margaret's brother Boninsegna, son of Oddorico da Arco, a nobleman, testified that about 28 years earlier his sister and four other young women along with several young men had joined the New Apostles and died at the stake. But two years earlier, according to Boninsegna, he had learned that she was alive and living in Vicenza under the name Maria. She had been imprisoned for three years, released by the Inquisition, married and had a fifteen-year-old son. There is no other source that mentions Margaret's survival and it is likely that the story of her escape was concocted to posthumously rehabilitate her.

Raymundo Gleyzer (September 25, 1941, Buenos Aires - missing since May 27, 1976) was an Argentine political filmmaker. He specialized in documentaries. He was disappeared as an opponent of the military dictatorship, and most likely murdered. Born into a Jewish family, Gleyzer became interested in politics and film early on. All his films he put into the service of the fight against social injustice and for the revolution. He made his first film in the backward northeast of Brazil, where he barely escaped imminent death. In the early 1970s he made a film in Mexico about the so-called \\"institutionalized revolution\\" of the PRI ruling party. The film was banned in Argentina at first, but found a lively echo in Mexico among the students. In 1973 he co- founded the Cine de la Base group, which organized demonstrations and discussions with workers (i.e. outside the cinema industry). His last major film, Los traidores (The Traitors), presents his critique of the Peronist political movement, which played an important role in Argentina in 1973. The film depicts how union leaders have allied themselves with entrepreneurs, the military and the US to maintain their personal power and enrich themselves. On May 27, 1976, Gleyzer was abducted and tortured, by a death squad of the military government that had come to power two months earlier, and never seen again. He is thus one of the tens of thousands of \\"desaparecidos\\" (disappeared) of the Argentine military dictatorship, most of which were secretly murdered. Brazilian cartoonist Carlos Latuff created a cartoon dedicated to Gleyzer and the violently \\"disappeared\\" people of Latin America.

Early life  Liddle, of Scottish descent, was born in Angaston, South Australia to Thomas and Matilda Ann Liddle.  Life in the Northern Territory  Liddle came to Alice Springs as a young man, to work at the Alice Springs Telegraph Station, in 1907. This is where he met, and married, Mary Earwaker the daughter of the blacksmith and a local Arrernte woman, in 1912. Following their marriage (during which they had four children) Liddle worked as a contractor for Gerhardt Johannsen, and constructed many of the stone buildings at Arltunga, including the Arltunga Police Station. He then started working at a number of local cattle stations including Maryvale Station, Mount Burrell, Bowson's Hole, Hamilton Downs and finally King's Creek Station before establishing his own station Angas Downs: named for his home town. Angas Downs, 300 kms southwest of Alice Springs, was first visited by Liddle in 1922 when, in dire circumstances, he found water at \\"Liddle Hills\\" and built a homestead there. He visited again in 1927 when over-landing 2000 sheep to South Australia. A formal lease was not officially granted until 1929. The Anangu name for this place is Walara. Bill Liddle had a good relationship with the Anangu and respected them and came to rely on their intimate knowledge of the land and their labour. In 1932 H.H. Finlayson stayed with Liddle at Angas Downs and, although it was his primary purpose of his expedition to study mammals he took many photographs and recordings of Aboriginal people here. In 1948 Liddle sold Angas Downs to two of his sons, Arthur and Milton Liddle. The brothers, and their Aboriginal descendants, ran sheep and then cattle until the 1990s when, following financial struggles, they sold to the Imanpa Development Association Inc. and it became the Angas Downs Indigenous Protected Area.

He began his career in gay erotic art in 1978 as illustrator and cover artist for Barazoku, the first commercially published gay magazine in Japan; he would be a regular contributor before departing the magazine in 1989. He would contribute artwork to other gay magazines throughout his career, notably , G-men, and SM-Z. Kimura would also contribute artwork to the early yaoi magazines June and Allan, making him among the first gay artists to achieve crossover success with a female audience in yaoi publications. He was a co-founding member of Studio Kaiz, along with Naoki Tatsuya and his partner Kihira Kai. Kimura's artwork was ubiquitous in gay publications in Japan in the 1970s and 1980s, with Gengoroh Tagame describing Kimura as the \\"face\\" of gay magazines in Japan. His works typically depict handsome, masculine men rendered in a homoerotic style that is frequently romantic and sensual, rather than explicitly pornographic.

He was the founder of the theory of cochlear function, and was also an advocate for Behaviourism as he argued in his book \\"The Psychology of the Other\\". During his time at the University of Missouri, he opened an experimental lab for Psychology and taught a variety of courses. His lab focused on Behavioural zeitgeist and the studies of nervous system and behaviour. Meyer eventually moved to Miami and lived there from 1932 until the late 1950s. Afterwards, he moved to Virginia to stay with his daughter until his death in 1967. Early life Max Friedrich Meyer was born in Germany in the small city of Danzig on June 14, 1873. He was the son of a goldsmith and went to school in Germany. In 1892, he went to the University of Berlin where he enrolled in theology, but he studied other subjects. He became a professor of experimental psychology and focused on the psychology of music. He married one of his students, Stella Sexton, on February 13, 1904 and had five children, Sophie, Harold, Catherine, Dorothy and Otto. Max Meyer divorced her in 1936. After his first year he switched to philosophy and met Hermann Ebbinghaus, and through that he met his mentor, Carl Stumpf. Stumpf and Meyer were interested in similar concepts relating to the psychology of music. At the University of Berlin, he worked under Carl Stumpf on psycho-acoustics for a couple of years and completed his PhD where he came up with his new theory of audition which questioned the current theories at the time. Meyer became a research associate under Stumpf after he finished his PhD in 1986. Due to a difference of opinion between Stumpf and Meyer, Meyer moved to the University of London where he worked under James Sully, and then moved to America and worked at Clark University, where he assisted G. Stanley Hall. Meyer was developing his work on cochlear function in hearing during this time. He was then finally appointed as a faculty member in 1900 at the University of Missouri. Career Meyer was the first-ever Psychology Professor hired by the University of Missouri. He opened the laboratory in experimental psychology and taught an extensive range of psychology courses during his professorship which included: Introduction to Psychology, Perception and Behaviour, Differential Psychology, General Aesthetics, Theory of Music, Advanced Psychology, Comparative Psychology, Social Psychology, Industrial Psychology and Abnormal Psychology. As of 2019, Meyer has 209 publications in three languages circulating in 2,439 library holdings around the world. =Behaviourism= Meyer was an early advocate of Behaviourism in America. In his book, The Psychology of the Other, he argues that psychology should focus on behaviour instead of the mind. Meyer did not deny the existence of consciousness like the other Behaviourists at that time, he was simply against the utilization of introspection as a scientific tool. His reasoning behind this was that he felt that it was not necessary to study the mind to understand human behaviour. He thought that one just needed to study the nervous law which oversees human behaviour to understand behaviour. Later in life Meyer taught courses about aesthetics as they had captured his attention during his undergraduate days. He went on to publish two journal articles about the topic. His work studies in the nervous system and behaviour came to the attention of John B. Watson, the father of Behaviourism. Meyer published important monographs, textbooks and journal articles in both music and psychology. =Language= Meyer also contributed to the field of language. He contends that infants learn speech sounds through impersonation. At first, audial speech sounds are a reflex in the young. They hear a sound and react by shaping a comparable sound. After some time, this impersonation stops. Acquiring speech sounds is dependent on whether or not making a similar sound is valuable to an individual or not. This loss of reflex is the reason why people cannot learn new dialects easily. In his book, fitting into the silent words, he talks about this stenograph system which he has created based on phonetics. He argued that it can be effective in deaf people for oral education. To back up his argument, he presented longitudinal studies using his system in deaf people. =Music theory= Meyer started developing his work during the year 1894 at the University of Berlin when he became a pupil to Carl Stumpf. During his time as a pupil, he was described as having a technical ingenuity that assisted Meyer in developing instruments to research music theory. During his years studying under Stumpf, he developed his theory of cochlear function. His main source of data was \\"introspective observations of difference tones, of the relative intensities of tones in a compound tone, and of the differences in relative intensity of tones sounded simultaneously and separately‚Äù. From this theory, he developed a hypothesis about \\"the anatomical and physiological properties of the ear\\" where the assumption was that \\"the inner ear is a hydraulic system, that the effective cochlear oscillations occur in the basilar membrane, that this membrane is inelastic, and that its motions passively follow the motions of the stapes\\". This received little attention until the year 1966. After having a falling out with Stumpf, he migrated to London and spent time in the psychological lab of James Sully at the University of London for 6 months. Here he worked on developing an apparatus where a deaf person could even compose, as well as worked on a theory of harmony. Meyer then travelled to America and spend time at Clark University and later the University of Missouri. Here he published a series of articles, one of them about an experiment he conducted back in Berlin which favoured the view that memory of absolute pitch can be improved with practice. This time was also very important as he published his first edition of his theory of music. In this first edition, he critiqued his predecessor Stumpf, as well as Hermann von Helmholtz, saying how he felt that their focus of the diatonic scale prevented them from developing a scientific, empirical theory of music. He also constructed a scale \\"represented by the infinite series of all composites of the powers of 2, 3, 5, and 7\\", which he believed was sufficient to study music theory. He extended his theory of music during his first year at Missouri, adding that the hearing of simultaneous tones contain two important effects: \\"the melodic relationship also heard in successive tones, and consonance\\". In 1903, Meyer conducted a study related to \\"the aesthetic effects of final tones, the intonation of musical intervals, and quartertone music\\". The findings of the study found that quartertone music in European music became more pleasant with increased familiarity (as long as it followed the ‚Äúgeneral laws of European music‚Äù). Since some quartertones were also present in Oriental music, he used these findings to support the theory that the psychological laws of music are the same all over the world, even though a good amount of this study relied on his own interpretation of certain results. Some of his final works included trying to develop tests that measured a variety of factors as well as trying to find a scientific music staff that would not require musical signs (ex. flats), but these results were never published. He also developed the musical arithmetic in 1929, which discusses the neurological implications of music perception, but this lacked reference to previous literature. Death and legacy From 1932 till 1940, Meyer lived in Miami where he continued his research and had a divorce in 1936. He later moved to Virginia and lived with his daughter until his death in 1967. The laboratory started by Meyer during 1930 would later become the Department of Psychology at the University of Missouri. His house is still preserved.

([https://web.archive.org/web/20190403013148/http://www.climate-lab- book.ac.uk/files/2018/12/wmo_stripes.png Direct link to image]) Climate communication or climate change communication is a field of environmental communication and science communication focused on facilitating the communications of the effects of anthropogenic climate change. Most climate communication focuses on bringing knowledge about and potential action for responding to scientific consensus on climate change to a broader public. The field of climate communication explores two main areas: the efficacy of existing communications strategies, and supporting the development of recommendations for improving that communication. Improving climate change communication has become the focus of several major research institutes, such as the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and Climate Outreach in the UK, as well as major international organizations, such as the IPCC and UN Climate Change Secretariat, and NGOs.  History  In her encyclopedia article in Oxford's Communications Research Encyclopedia, scholar Amy E. Chadwick describes Climate Change Communication as a new field emerging in the 1990s. Early studies were connected to other environmental communications concerns such as exploring awareness and understanding of ozone depletion. , most research in this field has been conducted in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Western European countries.  Major issues  = Barriers to understanding = Climate communications is heavily focused on methods for inviting larger scale public action to address climate change. To this end, a lot of research focuses on barriers to public understanding and action on climate change. Scholarly evidence shows that the information deficit model of communication‚Äîwhere climate change communicators assume \\"if the public only knew more about the evidence they would act\\"‚Äîdoesn't work. Instead, argumentation theory indicates that different audiences need different kinds of persuasive argumentation and communication. This is counter to many assumptions made by other fields such as psychology, environmental sociology, and risk communication. Additionally, climate denialism by organizations, such as The Heartland Institute in the United States, and individuals introduces misinformation into public discourse and understanding. There are several models for explaining why the public doesn't act once more informed. One of the theoretical models for this is the 5 Ds model created by Per Epsten Stoknes. Stokes describes 5 major barriers to creating action from climate communication: # Distance - many effects and impacts of climate change feel distant from individual lives # Doom - when framed as a disaster, the message backfires, causing Eco-anxiety # Dissonance - a disconnect between the problems (mainly the fossil fuel economy) and the things that people choose in their lives # Denial -- psychological self defense to avoid becoming overwhelmed by fear or guilt # iDentity -- disconnects created by social identities, such as conservative values, which are threatened by the changes that need to happen because of climate change. In her book Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life, Kari Norgaard's study of Bygdaby‚Äîa fictional name used for a real city in Norway‚Äîfound that non- response was much more complex than just a lack of information. In fact, too much information can do the exact opposite because people tend to neglect global warming once they realize there is no easy solution. When people understand the complexity of the issue, they can feel overwhelmed and helpless which can lead to apathy or skepticism.  Climate literacy  Though communicating the science about climate change under the premises of an Information deficit model of communication is not very effective in creating change, comfort with and literacy in the main issues and topics of climate change is important for changing public opinion and action. Several agencies and educational organizations have developed frameworks and tools for developing climate literacy, including the Climate Literacy Lab at Georgia State university, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Such resources in English have been collected by the Climate Literacy and Awareness Network. = Creating change = As of 2008, most of the environmental communications evidence for effecting individual or social change were focused on behavior changes around: household energy consumption, recycling behaviours, changing transportation behavior and buying green products. At that time, there were few examples of multi-level communications strategies for effecting change.  Behaviour change  Since much of Climate communication is focused on engaging broad public action, much of the studies are focused on effecting behavior change. Typically, effective climate communication has three parts: cognitive, affective and place based appeals. = Audience segmentation = The results of a public opinion poll by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. Yale is one of the principle research centers developing segmentation studies. Different parts of different populations respond differently to climate change communication. Academic research since 2013 has seen an increasing number of audience segmentation studies, to understand different tactics for reaching different parts of populations. Major segmentation studies include: * Segmentation of the American audiences into 6 groups: Alarmed, Concerned, Cautious, Disengaged, Doubtful and Dismissive. * Segmentation of Australians into 4 segments in 2011, and 6 segments analogous to the Six America's model. * Segmentation of German populations into 5 segments * Segmentation of Indian populations into the 6 segments * Segmentation of Singapore audiences into 3 segments = Changing rhetoric = A significant part of the research and public advocacy conversations about climate change have focused on the effectiveness of different terms used to describe \\"global warming\\".  History of global warming  = Health = Climate change exacerbates a number of existing public health issues, such as mosquito-borne disease, and introduces new public health concerns related to changing climate, such as increase in health concerns after natural disasters or increases in heat illnesses. Thus the field of health communication has long acknowledged the importance of treating climate change as a public health issue, requiring broad population behavior changes that allow societal climate change adaptation. A December 2008 article in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine recommended using two broad sets of tools to effect this change: communication and social marketing. A 2018 study, found that even with moderates and conservatives who were skeptical of the importance of climate change, exposure to information about the health impacts of climate change creates greater concern about the issues. = Media coverage = The effect of mass media and journalism on the public's attitudes towards climate change has been a significant part of communications studies. In particular, scholars have looked at how the media's tendency to cover climate change in different cultural contexts, with different audiences or political positions (for example Fox News's dismissive coverage of climate change news), and the tendency of newsrooms to cover climate change as an issue of uncertainty or debate, in order to give a sense of balance. = Popular culture = Further research has explored how popular media, like the film The Day After Tomorrow, popular documentary An Inconvenient Truth, and climate fiction change public perceptions of climate change.  Effective climate communication  Effective climate communications require audience and contextual awareness. Different organizations have published guides and frameworks based on experience in climate communications. This section documents those various guidelines. = General guidance = A 2009 handbook developed by the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions at the Earth Institute at Columbia University describes eight main principles for communications based on the psychological research about Environmental decisions: # Know your audience # Get the Audience's Attention # Translate Scientific Data into Concrete Expereinces # Beware the Overuse of Emotional Appeals # Address Scientific and Climate Uncertainties # Tap into Social Identities and Affiliates # Encourage Group Participation # Make Behavior Change Easier A strategy playbook, developed based on lessons learned from the COVID pandemic communication, was released On Road Media in the UK in 2020. The framework is focused on developing positive messages that help people feel optimistic about learning more to address climate change. This framework included six recommendations: # Make it do-able and show change is possible # Focus on the big things and how we can change them # Normalize action and change, not inaction # Connect the planet's health with our own health # Emphasis our shared responsibility for future generations # Keep it down to earth = By experts = In 2018, the IPCC published a handbook of guidance for IPCC authors about effective climate communication. It is based on extensive social studies research exploring the impact of different tactics for climate communication. The guidelines focus on six main principles: # Be a confident communicator # Talk about the real world, not abstract ideas # Connect with what matters to your audience # Tell a human story # Lead with what you know # Use the most effective visual communication = Visuals = Climate Visuals a nonprofit, published in 2020 a set of guidelines based on evidence for climate communications. They recommend that visual communications include: # Show real people # Tell new stories # Show climate change causes at scale # Show emotionally powerful impacts # Understand your audience # Show local (serious) impacts # Be careful with protest imagery. = Sustainable development = The impacts of climate change are exacerbated in low- and middle income countries; higher levels of poverty, less access to technologies, and less education, means that this audience needs different information. The Paris Agreement and IPCC both acknowledge the importance of sustainable development in addressing these differences. In 2019 nonprofit, Climate and Development Knowledge Network published a set of lessons learned and guidelines based on their experience communicating climate change in Latin America, Asia and Africa.

Meyer played a major role in the discovery of the main vein of gold on the Witwatersrand. As a field cornet, he inspected and surveyed land, giving him the opportunity to study the geological structure of the area and to search for subcrops. G.J. du Plessis found the main vein on Turffontein Farm on Meyer‚Äôs suggestion. He also founded Meyerskamp, later named Natalkamp, and co-owned the Meyer & Charlton Mine, becoming one of the first Afrikaner mining magnates. He was the first Volksraad member to represent Johannesburg, from 1887 to 1892. His main focus was the successful effort to grant Johannesburg municipality status. Second, he championed the building of the Delagoa Bay-Pretoria railway to supply the Rand‚Äôs markets for local and imported agricultural and industrial products. He realized that Delagoa Bay, closer than Durban or Cape Town, would be a better trade destination for miners, merchants, industrialists, and farmers around Johannesburg. Third, he played a role in establishing a Second Volksraad to represent Uitlander (foreigner) interests.  Background and youth  Meyer was the son of Johan George (Org) Meyer and Hester Christiana Elizabeth Mulder. Johan Meyer made the Great Trek as a young bachelor, originally a member of Hendrik Potgieter‚Äôs party, and went with them to Ohrigstad. Members of this group are held by tradition to have traveled to the site of the present Alberton South Reformed Church and buried a Voortrekker woman and child who died there where the parsonage is now. Org was probably one of the 11 men who traveled northward to find Louis Tregardt and explore the area. On his return in August 1836, he was just in time to defend the Trekkers from the Matabele at the Battle of Vegkop that October. Apparently, he then returned to Prince Albert, where he married Hester Mulder in 1840, who gave birth to Johannes Petrus (Jan) on June 26, 1842, five months before the foundation of the Prince Albert Reformed Church. In 1844, two-year-old Jan moved with his parents to Transvaal, where his father had purchased three farms: Elandsfontein (where they lived), Klipriviersberg, and Alwynspoort. The family traveled to the Karoo, and upon their return, Org built a house for a Smit who had settled in Klipriviersberg, pleased to have a neighbor in the sparsely populated area. In 1860, Smit died, after which Org sold Klipriviersberg. Jan, eighteen by then, wanted to buy it but competed with merchants who wanted a shop there since it was on the road from Vereeniging to Pretoria. The young man won with a bid of ¬£500, contributing ¬£200 of his own money but borrowing the rest from an Erasmus who went on to farm in Irene. Jan started a store there and began working as a carter. In 1855, the whole Meyer family traveled to Prince Albert, but Org died on the way back near Colesberg. The 13-year-old Jan therefore became the family breadwinner, helping them cross rivers and protecting the cattle from wild animals at night, while heavy rains robbed them of firewood. His brother had died in 1851 while crossing the Jukskei River during a storm in an ox-wagon to gather wood. The cattle and servants fled and Jan hid under the wagon. Jan Meyer married Christina Salmina Meyer (no relation), and, in 1860, they built his first house where the Alberton city hall now stands, on land purchased from his stepfather Abraham Viljoen for ¬£13. His cornfield and fruit trees were irrigated by a ditch from the Natalspruit River. Christina died giving birth to their fourth daughter on July 31, 1870. He remained there until the death of that daughter on August 29, 1871. In 1872, he remarried to the widow Stephina Petronella Botha (n√©e Strydom), with whom he moved to Klipriviersberg. They had a son and four daughters. His only formal education was at home from his widowed mother, but he showed an aptitude for public life early despite his rough upbringing.  Discovery of gold  After the discovery of gold in Barberton, Meyer came to visit and learned to identify gold-bearing ores. In the 1880s, according to tradition, Meyer found such ores on the Rand and informed the government of them. In 1884, he was assigned to survey the area to see if there were any unclaimed plots of land which could thus be claimed by the government. It took 18 months to complete, during which he found a piece of land he is said to have called Randjeslaagte. The state at the time‚Äîgiven how indebted it was‚Äîpaid field cornets very little, and the State Secretary of the South African Republic offered him the land as payment in kind when he asked for a raise. However, Volksraad was not in session, and the Secretary of State therefore said a decision would have to await its return. Meanwhile, once gold was discovered on the Rand, the South African Republic (ZAR) government decided to found a city there. There is no evidence that the State Secretary told Meyer this; Johannesburg is not named after him but after Christiaan Johannes Joubert and Johann Rissik.  Public life  The influx of immigrants to the Rand caused practical problems for landowners, many of whom fielded requests to mine on their farms. In at least one case, on F.J. Bezuidenhout‚Äôs Doornfontein Farm, one proceeded to dig without permission. Investors from Kimberley invested in farms or even bought them outright. Pretoria first assumed the rush would be short-lived, like those in Pilgrim‚Äôs Rest, Barberton, and Lydenburg. The main civil servant on the scene was Field Cornet Meyer, tasked with settling and granting mining claims, keeping the peace between owners and diggers, and generally enforcing the ZAR Constitution. With his growing responsibilities came great financial opportunities. Since the government believed the gold rush would wane, Meyer had to play the role of mining commissioner as well. On July 5, 1885 (according to some sources but more likely in 1886), he borrowed a prospector‚Äôs license and staked a claim of his own in Doornfontein as a friend of Bezuidenhout, thus co-founding the successful Meyer & Charlton Mine. Before long, the bonanza was so difficult to regulate that Meyer petitioned the government to declare open prospecting, which Pretoria agreed to in an August 4, 1886, declaration. C.J. Joubert and Rissik were sent to the area to determine which farms would be affected. They worked closely with Meyer in his various capacities. His store in Klipriviersberg was supplied by bullock cart from Kimberley and Pietermaritzburg, introducing him in the process to many from the Natal Colony. A miners‚Äô camp near his holdings was mainly populated by miners from that area as well, lending their name to that Natalkamp as well as the nearby- flowing Natalspruit.  Staking claims  The geological structure of the Rand required expensive heavy machinery to mine a claim. A lease letter from the government was needed to officially seal the owner-digger relationship and obtain the funds. The owner rented the land from the government, usually for up to ¬£5/acre/yr, receiving in return ¬£1/mo from the miners for prospecting rights in what was very much a seller‚Äôs market. On August 20, 1886, the government officially started issuing lease letters to owners and tenants. Areas between 50 and 500 acres could be granted in 50-acre lots. The 1885 Gold Law that allowed this also gave the owner the ability to reserve a tenth of their farm as their own claim before open prospecting was allowed. The government, however, reserved the right to collect 2.12% of the gold proceeds as a tax. Owners could stake another 10 claims as long as they paid the standard ¬£5/mo or less for each claim; they also specified which areas, such as gardens, fields, and the farmhouse, were off limits for mining. Mining licenses were up to ¬£20/mo. By not selling their farm, Boers gained financial windfalls.  Mining magnate  During the gold rush, people often came to Meyer as acting commissioner asking for licenses, but he refused to grant them if he visited and determined that the area did not contain gold. The miners had usually already purchased or optioned the land. Those who had bought one piece of land often opened other claims to ensure they still turned a profit amid the high demand, and fraud was common. Meyer‚Äôs partner, Charlton, thus fell into ¬£40,000 in debt, which Meyer paid off after borrowing money from the Bank of Natal. In this manner, Meyer became the sole owner of their mine west of today‚Äôs Johannesburg abattoir and north of the City Deep mine near what is now Kaserne. By 1889, there were signs that the mining industry was experiencing a slump. In several areas, the main vein was exhausted, requiring shafts to be built to reach deeper. Meyer then sold 100,000 ¬£1 shares of his mine on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Since his mine was known to be rich in gold, share prices soon climbed to ¬£10 a share. Afterwards, he sold it all and left the mining business a millionaire, using the proceeds to buy land between Hammanskraal, Warmbaths, Standerton, and the confluence of the Klip and Vaal Rivers. By the time he died in 1919, he owned 56,000 acres (around 48,000 ha). His children inherited 7,000 acres each. After the Second Boer War, he donated a parcel near Standerton to found a town for impoverished Afrikaners. The foundation of the Johannesburg Reformed Church (NGK) also owes a debt to Meyer. The decision to found a congregation there was reached during a service held by Rev. Van Warmelo at Meyer‚Äôs house.  Second Boer War  Like most Boers, Meyer was hit hard by the 1890s African rinderpest epizootic, losing many animals to it. During the Boer War, according to his grandson P.L. Meyer, he would smear the manure of known sick animals in the mouths of those who appeared to be sick as makeshift inoculation. Over 60 years old by the outbreak of war in 1899, Jan Meyer stayed home. His son Org, later a colonel, enlisted toward the end. Having lost his leg in a hunting accident, Jan had to walk with a crutch and therefore could not serve as a Boer Commando. His mansion, visible today along the highway from Germiston to Vereeniging and built in 1891, was not burned by the British Army. During the war, a series of blockhouses, visible today along that same highway, were built around Johannesburg to protect the local gold mines, among other things. Most of the farms where these were built were left untouched as well. Part of the reason for this was the British military government‚Äôs sympathies for Meyer as a city- founding mining magnate who represented Uitlander interests in Johannesburg and the Transvaal Volksraad alike. He did not support the Maritz Rebellion of 1914. However, he brought food every morning to its instigator, Gen. Christiaan de Wet, when the latter was imprisoned in Johannesburg.  Volksraad member  The election laws of the ZAR left the Afrikaners with the political power in Johannesburg despite their being in the minority. All citizens over 21 who were members of a Protestant church could vote for the Volksraad. In 1890, under pressure to serve the growing immigrant population, the government lifted the religious proscriptions and established a Second Volksraad in which immigrants could, two years after they completed their two- year naturalization process, vote after paying a ¬£5 fee. Twelve years after naturalization, they could vote for the First Volksraad. For the first year after the discovery of gold, Johannesburg was represented in the Volksraad by the member for the Heidelberg district. On November 23, 1887, the Executive Council declared the mining areas of Barberton, Komatipoort, and Steynsdorp as one district representing the Rand. With the foundation of the Second Volksraad, Johannesburg was represented by one member in each chamber. At the beginning of 1888, Meyer became the first such representative in the Volksraad, bringing his civil service and mining experience thereby to bear. He advocated primarily for granting Johannesburg municipality status, building a railway from Delagoa Bay to Pretoria, and establishing the Second Volksraad. The latter initiative was in part meant to assuage his and others‚Äô concerns that Uitlanders would dominate the First Volksraad by sheer numbers otherwise. Important priorities of foreign affairs and defense would remain the role of the First, along with the care of the aging more likely to vote there, a key priority for the son of Voortrekkers who treasured their sense of independence. His affinity for Uitlander aspirations came in part from working with so many of them, English-speaking and otherwise, and he would go on to be a founding member in 1894 of the Witwatersrand Agricultural Society (later the hosts of the annual Rand Show), where he served until his death as esteemed Deputy President. Election campaigns began as soon as the Second Volksraad was founded. H.J. Morkel, the first candidate in the field, was a fluently bilingual veteran of six years in the Kroonstad in the Orange Free State Volksraad, but had to withdraw as a non-citizen of the ZAR. This decision drew criticism from Carl Jeppe and Johannes de Meillon. The inquiry committee, including special magistrate Carl von Brandis and mining commissioner Jan Eloff, found that the vote-counters were not sworn in properly and that Jeppe had supplied voters with liquor, leading the Government to annul the results of the election. Thus, the Rand had only Meyer representing them in the First Volksraad and nobody in the Second. Four candidates stood for the by-election redo on July 29, 1891. C. L. Neethling had represented Heidelberg in 1881 in the Volksraad, but could not obtain the necessary signatures to get his name on the ballot and therefore withdrew, in part due to bad blood between him and Meyer. The Star wrote that \\"Oom Jan deserves so well of this community, he has done such yeoman's service in our cause\\", going on to recommend rejecting Neethling in the name of supporting Johannesburg and not opposing Meyer. Jeppe‚Äôs withdrawal left J. F. Celliers and De Meillon as the only candidates. Celliers won the turbulent election, though De Meillon complained to the government that his supporters were prevented from voting. The complaint was dismissed by a committee of inquiry, and Celliers became the first Johannesburg member of the Second Volksraad. By April 4, 1892, Meyer‚Äôs popularity had declined the point where only nine attended his town hall that day. In August 1892, he suffered another setback when he confused two Volksraad petitions, one from the Health Committee and one from the inhabitants of Doornfontein, causing the former to be rejected. This was seen as a betrayal, \\"and it is Jan Meyer who is the turncoat, who goes back on his promises, snubs the Board and Johannesburg generally, and stands in the way of its progress and prosperity\\". Meyer earned plaudits for the Delagoa Bay Railway, his efforts to best implement the Gold Law, and his fiery opposition to the concession system in foreign affairs. He was, however, unenthusiastic about granting the franchise to Uitlanders, seeing no chance of passing something so contrary to the opinions of the Volksraad. These views made him increasingly unpopular with the Uitlanders and with the English-language press. Although his biggest critics could not vote, Afrikaners mostly followed the Anglophone press until the late 1890s and therefore favored its choices at the ballot box. When he attracted only five to an October 24, 1892, campaign stop, he saw the writing on the wall and stood down for the January 1893 election, ending his career in the Volksraad.  Foundation of Alberton  Meyer was only partially involved with the foundation of Alberton. He owned part of Elandsfontein, while his mother owned the rest. At the height of the gold fever, an American company offered the widow ¬£75,000 for the 120 acres her husband had left her. Meyer and Bezuidenhout were the executors of her estate, and turned for advice to Bezuidenhout, who countered with an offer of ¬£85,000. To Meyer‚Äôs dismay, Bezuidenhout reacted to a telegram from De Aar in which the company agreed by raising the price to ¬£90,000. The matter was dropped, and in 1903, Gen. Hennie Alberts bought the land for ¬£22,000 and founded Alberton there.  Foundation of the Rand Easter Show  The discovery of diamonds in Kimberley and gold in Johannesburg created a great demand for food and thus a major opportunity for farmers. Before the mineral rushes, most Free State and Transvaal Boers were subsistence farmers. Each farm kept a pair of horses for transport, a few teams of oxen to pull wagons for hunting, attending communion, and trips to town to buy supplies. There were poultry, wheat and maize fields, a small kitchen garden, and a peach orchard. The mining bonanzas provided an impetus for developing cash crop agriculture and required an organized body to promote, expand, improve, and modernize agricultural production. Many agricultural societies had failed to build a nationwide profile, while the Transvaal Volksraad had been very hostile to the idea of establishing a department of agriculture. On March 18, 1894, a group of men in Johannesburg gathered to consider founding an organization to promote farming and organize fairs. They agreed to form a recruitment committee and to hold a general members‚Äô meeting in May. Meyer was present at the inaugural meeting of the Witwatersrand Agricultural Society on May 15, where an Executive Council was elected. This society would annually hold what came to be known as the Rand Easter Show or simply the Rand Show, aided in this effort by Meyer‚Äôs role as a liaison between the Society and the ZAR Executive Council. As a Volksraad member for Johannesburg and later Heidelberg, his support was crucial to obtain seed money and fair grounds for the first Rand Show, which was opened with pomp and circumstance by State President of the South African Republic Paul Kruger and a guard of honor including 50 armed citizens including Field Cornet Meyer. At the foundation meeting, Meyer was named Deputy President of the Society, a role he held off and on until his death in 1919. To Meyer, the Society played another key role: a force for improving relations between Boers and English-speakers. At some time before the Second Boer War, he resigned as Deputy President, only rejoining in March 1907. On the eve of the 1908 exhibition, he sternly advocated for continued government involvement and better advocacy for Transvaal cattle breeding. Meyer opposed the state itself competing for prizes and cups before ordinary farmers had a chance to do so. Therefore, government entries could only get certificates for the highest awards. Care was also taken to price locally bred livestock fairly. In 1910, Meyer was reelected Deputy President. The provision of refreshments proved another major problem. Meyer donated an already built teahouse for the purpose ahead of the 1915 Show. He resigned in protest in 1918, a year when no Afrikaners were elected to the Executive Council of the Society. Nevertheless, he believed that agriculture was one area where the \\"two white groups\\" could find common ground.  Death  Meyer died at the age of 77. Walking on his farm with a gun, he stumbled and accidentally shot himself in the head. He was buried on December 4, 1919, on his Klipriviersberg farm.  Sources  * Raper, Peter Edmund (2004).

Early life  Khandwala was born in 1926 to an affluent family in Burma (now, Myanmar) as the fifth of seven siblings. Her grandfather was a doctor and a lawyer. Her mother, Lilavati Chhaganlal Mehta, was the recruiting officer at the Rani of Jhansi Regiment and a part of the Indian Independence League. At the age of 17, Khandwala and her sister Neelam joined the Regiment as sepoys after hearing Bose's speech in Rangoon. She attended a private school where the popular refrain was: \\"Britain shall always rule the waves\\".  Career  Joining as a Sepoy, Khandwala soon became the Second Lieutenant at the Regiment and led 30 Ranis for two years in Rangoon (now, Yangon). Speaking about her experience with Conde Nast Traveller, she said: As a part of the Regiment, she was trained to be a soldier and a nurse. Military training included rifle and bayonet practice, handling machine guns and STEN guns, and defense and attack maneuvers. Medical training included working in general wards and operating rooms. In 1944, she worked as a nurse in a hospital located in Maymyo (now, Pyin Oo Lwin) and almost died in an air raid. After World War II, she and family was put under house-arrest for six months and later moved to Bombay (now, Mumbai) in 1946. In the initial year, she worked as a secretary in a trading firm, nurse, and a Japanese language translation but she was not much keen on desk jobs. Later, she spotted an advertisement for becoming trained tourist guides and decided to pursue it. She had learned Japanese during their occupation of Burma between 1942 and 1945. She has worked as a translator for documentaries created by Japanese television channels and many corporate. During her stint as an interpreter for a Japanese documentary, she met Dalai Lama and accompanied the King of Bhutan on a hike to Elephanta's Buddhist caves as a guide. Presently, she is an active tourist guide and popular with Japanese tourists in India. Fondly called Rama Ben, she has been a tourist guide for over 50 years. In 2019, she became a TEDx speaker.  Personal life  She got married in Bombay in 1949 and her husband died in 1982, and she has one daughter.  Recognition  In 2017, President Ram Nath Kovind felicitated Khandwala with the Best Tourist Guide Award at the National Tourism Awards. On India's 72nd Independence Day, Khandwala inaugurated and was the chief guest at the Indian Film Festival organised by the Films Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.

He founded the , an organization for laborers.  Early life and education  Suzuki was born the oldest child of Suzuki Masuji on September 4, 1885 in what is now Kurihara, Miyagi prefecture. When he was 10 years old he and his father converted to Christianity. His family began to struggle financially when Suzuki was in middle school, and by the time he reached high school he had to pay his own way through school. These circumstances and the influences of , a missionary, made him interested in social problems. He entered Tokyo Imperial University and with his upperclassman Sakuz≈ç Yoshino, he began attending the Hongo Congregational Church ministered by Ebina Danjo. Influenced by the church's democratic atmosphere and sympathizing with 's reformist ideas, Suzuki decided to become a social activist.  Career  After graduating from the university in 1909, Suzuki began working at what is now Dai Nippon printing. He got a job at the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun in 1910. He covered poverty. In 1911 he became the secretary of a Unitarian group that was headed by Abe Isoo. He also worked with a labor group. In 1912 he formed the Y≈´aikai with 14 other people, so that they could raise the status of laborers. Suzuki served as the chairman. Branches of the organization opened all over Japan, with a total of 51 by the end of 1915. In 1915 and 1916 Suzuki traveled to the United States to learn about labor unions there. While learning about labor rights and strike actions, he was inspired to push for all of the labor organizations to merge in order to obtain more bargaining power. In 1919, the Y≈´aikai renamed itself to the Nippon R≈çd≈ç S≈çd≈çmei Y≈´aikai. By 1921, the organization became simply the Nippon R≈çd≈ç S≈çd≈çmei, or the Japanese Federation of Labor. That year the group was able to convince 30,000 dock workers in Kobe to go on strike. In 1926 he helped to form the Social Democratic Party. During the 1928 Japanese general election, he was elected to the House of Representatives representing Osaka's 4th district. He was one of the eight people who were the first to be elected to the Diet without a political party affiliation. After losing his seat in 1930, he was reelected in 1936 as a member of the Shakai Taish≈´t≈ç. In 1940, Sait≈ç Takao was expelled from the Diet for making a speech questioning the \\"Holy War\\" in China. Suzuki supported him by leaving office along with several other Diet members. On March 12, 1946, Suzuki died in Sendai, Miyagi prefecture.

It will depict the life of Miguel Malvar, one of the last Filipino generals to surrender in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. The film will star Manny Pacquiao as the titular General Malvar, with Isko Moreno as Andr√©s Bonifacio and E.R. Ejercito as Emilio Aguinaldo. Producer Jose Malvar Villegas Jr. began plans for a film about General Malvar in 2000, though it was stalled due to apprehension that the American government, a close ally of the Philippines, could be offended with the work. After Rodrigo Duterte became the Philippine President in 2016 and favored a more independent foreign policy for the country, Villegas was encouraged to proceed with his plans, with Pacquiao cast as Malvar by mid-2019. Though shooting was intended to take place in Batangas, the eruption of Taal Volcano in the province forced the production to move to Bulacan. As plans for a Malvar film production became more public in late 2019, controversy arose over the production's lack of sought permission from Malvar's descendants, while the casting of Pacquiao as Malvar has been criticized. The film is intended to be submitted as an entry of the 46th Metro Manila Film Festival for a December 25, 2020 release date. Cast *Manny Pacquiao as Miguel Malvar Filipino general in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Pacquiao's casting as Malvar was announced on August 27, 2019 by Batangas Governor Hermilando \\"DoDo\\" Mandanas during a ceremony declaring him as Batangas' \\"adopted son\\". Director Jose \\"Kaka\\" Balagtas and Pacquiao have previously worked together on films such as Anak ng Kumander and Basagan ng Mukha. *Isko Moreno as Andr√©s Bonifacio In September 2019, Pacquiao expressed interest in Judy Ann Santos taking the lead female role, while Mayor Isko Moreno of Manila and ER Ejercito were also strongly considered for other roles in the film. On October 21, Moreno was officially cast as Andres Bonifacio, with his talent fee to be fully donated to the Philippine General Hospital. *E.R. Ejercito as Emilio Aguinaldo *Daniel Fernando as Emilio Jacinto *Jerico Ejercito as Gregorio del Pilar *Mark Leviste The full cast was presented at the Great Eastern Hotel's Aberdeen Court in Quezon City on December 22, 2019, with Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo in attendance. Production =Development= Producer Jose Malvar Villegas Jr.'s plans for a biographical film about General Miguel Malvar began in 2000, which at the time was stalled for an extended period due to the risk of offending the American government. However, after Rodrigo Duterte became president and advocated for a more independent foreign policy, Villegas was encouraged to proceed with his plans and committed to depicting in the film the atrocities committed during American colonization of the Philippine islands. =Filming= Malvar was directed by Jose \\"Kaka\\" Balagtas and the provincial government of Batangas had involvement in its production. According to Balagtas, filming locations for Malvar will include the Padre Pio Shrine in Santo Tomas, Batangas and the Bay Laguna, a development were the Malvar Ecumenical and Film World Center will be built. Filming for the trailer began on October 18, 2019. Villegas Jr., the head of JMV Film Production who reportedly is also a grandson of Malvar, serves as the producer of the film. Director Balagtas also doubles as the event producer. Imelda Papin, a singer and songwriter is Malvar's line producer with Florita Santos also involved as a co-producer. According to Michael Balaguer of the online news site Diaryong Tagalog, shooting locations will be moved from Batangas to the municipalities of Plaridel and Pandi in Bulacan due to the January 2020 eruption of Taal Volcano. Production was hampered once again by March, this time due to the coronavirus pandemic which has led to a lockdown of the entire Luzon area on March 17. The film is intended to be submitted to the 46th edition (2020) of the Metro Manila Film Festival, in addition to other international film festivals. Controversy The production of Malvar has received controversy for the lack of sought permission from any of the descendants of Miguel Malvar other than producer Jose Malvar Villegas Jr. and his historian brother Edberto. Gabriel Malvar, the great grandson of Miguel Malvar, questioned the casting choice for the titular general of the film saying that his grandfather have his name \\"associated with anyone in politics\\" since Pacquiao is also a incumbent senator and also noted how Pacquiao's personality will \\"dominate\\" the film which he believed would detract the audience's attention from his grandfather's life to Pacquiao.

He was featured in the 2013 BBC documentary series Kangaroo Dundee. Barns and the Kangaroo Sanctuary came to international attention when Roger, one of the earlier kangaroos that he adopted, went viral for his muscular physique.  Early Life  Barns grew up in Perth in Western Australia in the 1970s and he was a shy child who did not excel in school. Barns partially attributes this to being 6 feet (182cms) tall by his early teens. Barns left home, at the age of 17, to work as a zoo keeper in Broome; going to work at several wildlife parks before starting work as a tour guide.  Work with kangaroos  In the early 2000s, when working as a tour guide running tours between Alice Springs and Uluru, Barns came across a joey, still in its dead mother's pouch, near Curtin Springs. The kangaroo mother, who had been hit by a car, had been dead for some time and, with the help of a nurse on the tour, they managed to free the 4-month-old joey. The tour group named it Anna (later renamed Palau). This experience made Barns angry about how many vehicles had already driven past the dead mother and not thought to check that she may have a joey. He decided that it would be his mission to tell people about how to check. Following this, in 2005, Barns started the first incarnation of the Kangaroo Sanctuary, the Baby Kangaroo Rescue Centre, and many joeys started being sent to him, mostly through a combination of road accidents and hunting. in 2007 alone, 75 joeys were brought into the sanctuary and this included Roger on 24 May 2007; it was initially thought he would not survive long. In 2009, after exceeding capacity at the existing site, Barns moved on to what is now known as the Kangaroo Sanctuary, funded primarily by donation and entry fees. In 2013 Barns and the sanctuary were featured in the BBC documentary series Kangaroo Dundee, a six-part series which he followed up with the book Kangaroo Dundee (with James Knight). In 2014 he married Tahnee Passmore and they share their home with a family of joeys.

Given the complex geology and topography of the district, it has been organised into land systems - areas with specific and unique geomorphic and geological characteristics, characterised by a particular soil distribution along the soil catena. Soil types are classified in line with World Reference Base for Soil Resources and reference made to main characteristics that can be observed in the field. = Basalt plateaus = Typical catena on the Basalt plateaus * Associated soil types ** shallow, very stony, loamy soils (Leptic and Skeletic Cambisol and Regosol) (4) ** deep, very dark waterlogged during the wet season (Vertisol) (15) ** moderately deep, brown, loamy soils with a good natural fertility (Luvisol) (26) * Inclusions ** complex of rock outcrops, very stony and very shallow soils ((Lithic) Leptosol) (1) ** moderately deep, stony, dark cracking clays (Vertic Cambisol) (10) = Adigrat Sandstone cliff and footslope = Typical catena on the Adigrat Sandstone cliff and footslope * Associated soil types ** complex of rock outcrops, very stony and very shallow soils ((Lithic) Leptosol) (1) ** shallow, stony sandy loam soils (Eutric Regosol and Cambisol) (21) * Inclusions ** shallow, dry soils with very high amounts of stones (Leptic and Skeletic Cambisol and Regosol) (4) ** deep, dark cracking clays with good fertility, but problems of waterlogging (Chromic and Pellic Vertisol) (12) ** soils with stagnating water due to an abrupt textural change such as sand over clay (Haplic Planosol ) (34) = Severely incised granite near Giba mouth = Typical catena on severely incised granite near Giba mouth * Dominant soil type: rock outcrops and very shallow soils (Lithic Leptosol) (1) * Associated soil type: shallow, very stony, silt loamy to loamy soils (Skeletic Cambisol, Leptic Cambisol, Skeletic Regosol) (4) = Severely incised metamorphic sedimentary rock = Severely incised metamorphic sedimentary rock * Dominant soil type: rock outcrops and very shallow soils (Lithic Leptosol) (1) * Associated soil type: shallow, stony loam soils (Eutric Regosol and Cambisol) (21) * Inclusion: clays of floodplains with very high watertable with moderate to good natural fertility (Eutric Gleysol, Gleyic Cambisol) (33) = Soils on metamorphic volcanic rock = Typical catena on metamorphic volcanic rock * Dominant soil type: rock outcrops and very shallow soils (Lithic Leptosol) (1) * Associated soil types ** shallow, very stony, silt loamy to loamy soils (Skeletic Cambisol, Leptic Cambisol, Skeletic Regosol) (4) ** shallow, stony loam soils (Eutric Regosol and Cambisol) (21) * Inclusion: sandy clay loams to sands developed on sandy colluvium (Eutric Arenosol, Regosol, Cambisol) (24)  Soil erosion and conservation  The reduced soil protection by vegetation cover, combined with steep slopes and erosive rainfall has led to excessive soil erosion. Nutrients and organic matter were lost and soil depth was reduced. Hence, soil erosion is an important problem, which results in low crop yields and biomass production. As a response to the strong degradation and thanks to the hard labour of many people in the villages, soil conservation has been carried out on a large scale since the 1980s and especially 1980s; this has curbed rates of soil loss. Measures include the construction of infiltration trenches, stone bunds, check dams, small reservoirs such as Addi Asme'e as well as a major biological measure: exclosures in order to allow forest regeneration.

It occurred at a test flight of a new hydrogen balloon by aeronaut Henry Tracey Coxwell, for which 50,000 spectators attended. The crowd were enraged by rumours that the balloon was not the largest and newest of Coxwell's balloons and because a woman was allegedly struck by a police officer. Coxwell's balloon was damaged, upon which he caused the gas envelope to collapse and fled, under attack from the crowd. The balloon was subsequently torn to pieces and its basket burnt. The event caused considerable expense to Coxwell who had to build a replacement balloon and set back progress in scientific high-level flights.  Background  Henry Tracey Coxwell Henry Tracey Coxwell was an English aeronaut of the mid to late 19th-century. He became famous for a 5 September 1862 flight with meteorologist James Glaisher. Setting off from Wolverhampton in the West Midlands in a hydrogen balloon they reached a record altitude of . With low oxygen levels and temperatures below the pair almost died before Coxwell managed to release gas from a valve with his teeth (his hands being unusable) to lose height. The flight, which was funded by the British Association for the Advancement of Science, provided valuable data about the earth's atmosphere and Coxwell and Glaisher resolved to continue high altitude flights. Following the Wolverhampton flight and a subsequent flight on 29 September Coxwell determined that his balloon's gas envelope was too worn to carry out further flights. He constructed a new envelope which he named Britannia. It was capable of holding of gas, a more than 10% improvement over his previous envelope. The new balloon required low altitude flights for testing and to make the envelope gas-tight so Coxwell carried out a series of demonstration flights in June at Crystal Palace and Derby. Coxwell planned a further flight on 11 July 1864 from the racecourse at Victoria Park, Leicester during a fete organised by the Foresters Friendly Society. Tickets were sold and 13 passengers, including two women, were scheduled to accompany Coxwell on his flight.  Riot  The fete was attended by 50,000 people and was lightly policed (Coxwell later claimed there were only eight policemen on duty). The flight was to take place at 5.30pm from a field. The field was enclosed by a fence but there was only an insubstantial barrier surrounding the balloon. Early in the afternoon there was a disturbance when a gentleman, claiming to be an aeronaut, announced that Britannia was not Coxwell's newest and biggest balloon but an older model. This enraged the crowd who, shortly after 2pm, broke down the barrier and demanded that Coxwell take off immediately. At around this time Coxwell's passengers forced their way into the balloon basket against his instructions in such a manner that prevented him from taking off. The carpenters necessary to remove the scaffold from around the balloon were also not available. One of the passengers then announced to the crowd that Coxwell was refusing to ascend and this, combined with his bad language and gestures, enraged them. It is said that the police, who numbered only five in the immediate vicinity of the balloon, then struck a female member of the crowd on the forehead. She fell to the ground bleeding which is said to have caused further anger in the crowd. A member of the crowd threw a bottle which damaged the balloon envelope and others tore the mesh enclosing it. Coxwell threatened that unless order was restored and the crowd moved back he would let the gas out of the balloon. There was no response to this, aside from verbal abuse, and Coxwell followed through on his threat. After the envelope collapsed the crowd surged forwards and tore it to pieces. The police, led by Inspector Haynes and Sergeant Chapman, attempted to hold back the crowd but could do little more than attempt to protect Coxwell. Coxwell was attacked, amid shouts of \\"rip him up\\", \\"knock him on the head\\" and \\"finish him\\", and his clothes were torn. One man who attempted to protect him was knocked to the ground three times. Coxwell eventually found refuge at the house of the town clerk, Mr Stone, who lived nearby. Britannia was destroyed and the balloon car, used for all of Coxwell's earlier ascents (including his famous high altitude trip with Glaisher) was burnt. The metal hoop, which supported the envelope, was paraded through the streets of Leicester by the mob. One woman suffered injuries during the riot and was taken to hospital with a suspected broken back.  Aftermath  James Glaisher Coxwell laid the blame for the riot with the Leicester City Police, who he said had failed to provide a sufficient number of officers. He also stated that some of the mob wore the distinctive badge of the Foresters Society, apportioning some blame to them. The London Review of Politics, Society, Literature, Art and Science described the crowd as \\"a horde of savages as fierce and untamed as South Sea Islanders and differing very little from them except in their habitat, which was at Leicester\\" and the local residents were for some time known as \\"Balloonatics\\" due to their association with the riot. However, Leicester residents laid the blame on agitators from other cities such as Nottingham. The riot served as a demonstration of the ad hoc nature of early ballooning events and the lack of control aeronauts had over them. The destruction of Britannia curtailed the number of high-altitude flights that the BA's balloon committee had planned to make in 1864. Glaisher noted that he \\"deeply regretted that a wanton mob destroyed [Coxwell's] property and that events should have followed leading me to stop the experiments in which I was engaged\\". Coxwell soon afterwards returned to low level flights using his old balloon and, on 29 August, made such a flight from Crystal Palace with Glaisher. He constructed a new balloon, Research, even larger than Britannia had been, which flew in 1865. The new balloon was a considerable expense to Coxwell. He applied to the Foresters Society for a grant to cover his costs but their rules required a period of delay before he could be paid. The Mayor of Leicester, keen to restore the city's standing, led a campaign for public subscriptions to cover the costs. This raised some ¬£500, of which ¬£386 came from one individual ‚Äì a Mr E. S. Ellis. The riot marked the beginning of the end for Coxwell's association with Glaisher. Glaisher was associated with the London branch of the Foresters Society and supported Coxwell's application for funding. However, there was later a disagreement ‚Äì Glaisher claimed Coxwell had behaved \\"impertinently\\" towards him over the matter. Indeed, one of Glaisher's allies described the Research, as \\"ill-gotten property\\" due to the \\"way in which [Coxwell] obtained the money from Leicester\\".

Another reason is if a poor technique is used that does not deposit enough filler metal along the edges of the weld. A third reason is using an incorrect filler metal, because it will create greater temperature gradients between the center of the weld and the edges.

In 1908 she founded the \\"Deutsche T√§nzerbund\\" (loosely, \\"German Dancers' Association\\"), after which she quickly emerged as a public spokeswoman on behalf of her fellow professionals. 1908 had been the year in which the constitutional prohibition on female membership of political parties - already enforced with varying degrees of effectiveness in different parts of Germany - was formally lifted, but it was only in 1918, in the aftermath of the disastrous war, that Olga Brandt joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD. Alongside her party membership, she worked between 1918 and 1933 as an arts policy consultant (\\"kulturpolitische Referentin\\") to the \\"Genossenschaft Deutscher B√ºhnen- Angeh√∂riger\\" (GDBA / loosely \\"Co-operative of German stage performers and workers\\"). It was also in, or shortly after, 1918 that she teamed up with the actor Adolf Johannsson to set up a \\"Workers' Speech and Movement Chorus\\" (\\"Arbeiter-Sprech- und Bewegungschor\\"). Later, in 1932, she joined with Lola Rogge (and others), to form the \\"Vereinigung Tanz\\" (\\"Dance Association\\") in Hamburg. On the national stage 1932 was a year of intensifying political polarisation and deadlock: at the Hamburg State Opera Olga Brandt-Knack lost her position as lead ballerina on account of her political activities. On 26 February 1920 Olga Brandt married Andreas Knack. It was now that her name became \\"Olga Brandt-Knack\\". Andreas Knack was a physician and later became director of the Asklepios Klinik Barmbek (hospital) in the city. It is not clear how long the marriage lasted, but it was over by 1928, which was the year in which Knack married his second wife. In January 1933 the National Socialists took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one- party dictatorship. With political party membership now illegal (other than membership of the National Socialist Party), she terminated her party membership. Olga Brandt-Knack's record as an active SPD member nevertheless led to her being classified as \\"politically unreliable\\". The Hamburg State Opera was terminated her employment and she was obliged to give up the dance school she was running. She was later placed under surveillance by the security services and, on at least one occasion, briefly arrested. Unable to work professionally, she now, like her sister, took a job as a surgery appointments clerk till 1942. Between 1942 and the war's end in 1945 she moved out of the city and lived quietly with friends in the countryside. She rejoined the SPD in 1945. From 1948 she also worked as an advisor on women's issues to the Gewerkschaft Kunst (confederation of determinedly independent arts related trades unions). She was, in addition, one of those who re-founded The Falcons, a socialist youth organisation that had originated in 1904 but then been banned during the Hitler years. Between 30 October 1946 and 1 November 1953, Olga Brandt-Knack served as an SPD member of the \\"Hamburgische B√ºrgerschaft\\" (\\"Hamburg Parliament\\"). After that, till 1961, she served as deputy head of the city's police authority.

History  Annunciation by Hans Memling Hans Leo Hassler studied in Venice with Andrea Gabrieli, and was a musician for the Fugger family in Augsburg. He composed Dixit Maria as a motet for choir a cappella, setting a verse from Luke's narration of the annunciation in Latin, specifically Mary's consent to the announcement that she would bear a son. The motet is suitable for the feast of the Annunciation. He included the motet in his 1591 collection Cantiones sacrae (Sacred songs). Hassler also composed a mass on the theme Dixit Maria, the Missa super Dixit Maria. Carus-Verlag included the motet in a 2013 Chorbuch Advent, a choral collection for Advent.  Music  The motet is written for four voices, soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. The style is reminiscent of a canzona, in an ABB structure. The a section, rendering the text \\"Mary said to the angel\\", is set in imitative polyphony. The B section, repeated with a slightly modified ending, sets Mary's words, beginning in homophony.

Early career Ramsey graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1927 and earned his wings in 1930. During the 1930s, he served on the carriers Lexington and Saratoga. He was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on 1 July 1941 and became commanding officer of Fighting Squadron 2 (VF-2) aboard Lexington. During the early stages of the Pacific War, his executive officer was Lieutenant James Flatley. They both participated in the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942, although Flatley had been transferred to Fighter Squadron 42 (VF-42) just prior to the battle, and so was serving aboard the Yorktown. Coral Sea On 7 May, Lieutenant Commander Ramsey led a division of Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters escorting Douglas TBD Devastators from Torpedo Squadron 2 (VT-2) in the attack that sank the light carrier Sh≈çh≈ç. In response to the sinking of Sh≈çh≈ç, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) main carrier force launched a night strike on the US carriers composed of 15 Nakajima B5N and 12 Aichi D3A bombers. Ramsey led a group of F4F Wildcats to intercept. He set up an ambush in heavily overcast weather, which resulted in numerous losses of IJN aircraft and some of their most experienced pilots. He personally destroyed two B5N torpedo bombers, although he claimed them as Zeros. The following day, on 8 May, Lieutenant Commander Ramsey was involved in Combat Air Patrol over the US carriers. His division of F4F Wildcats spotted an approaching formation of D3A dive bombers at a higher altitude. However, they were unable to climb in time to intercept, due to the poor climb rate of F4F Wildcat and relatively high altitude difference. After the enemy dive bombers made their attack on the US carriers, he and his wingman spotted a Mitsubishi A6M Zero (which he thought was an Me 109) at a lower altitude and dived on it. They hit the Zero, but it managed to escape into a cloud. Moments later, Ramsey spotted another lone Zero, which he claimed shot down (though no Zeros were actually lost). Later career After Coral Sea, he returned to Washington, DC, where in, April 1943, he was appointed director of the flight test division at the Anacostia Naval Air Station. He later commanded the carrier Philippine Sea during the Korean War. He retired from the Navy in 1966.

It contains a single species, Tarumania walkerae, and constitutes the only genus in the family Tarumaniidae. T. walkerae is a predatory species that hunts among the leaf litter of the flooded forest floor in the Rio Negro drainage basin. Discovery and taxonomy The species first came to the attention of scientists in 2002 in the form of a poorly preserved juvenile specimen collected as part of a survey. The specimen possessed many unusual traits and could not be identified even to family level. Due to the poor preservation, no formal description was attempted until many years later, after the discovery of a living population and collection of better specimens. The genus name Tarumania was chosen after the site of first collection (the Tarum√£ Mirim River). Tarumania is a characiform, the order which includes piranhas and tetras. Due to its distinctness from all other characiformes, the describers placed it in its own family, Tarumaniidae. Based on their morphological analysis they estimated Tarumaniidae to be most likely the sister group of Erythrinidae, the trahira family, but no DNA evidence was available to confirm or deny this. Description and biology Tarumania possesses a very unusual swimbladder, divided into eleven separate compartments (as opposed to one or two in most fish) which extends along almost the entire length of the body. Its body is extremely elongated and oval-shaped, giving the fish an eel-like appearance. All specimens of Tarumania were recovered from isolated pools among the leaf-litter of the forest, where they appear to hunt invertebrates such as shrimp on the flooded forest floor. They are well adapted to swim amongst tangled undergrowth, with very mobile pelvic fins that move independently of each other and the ability to twist separately from the rest of the body. They are able to breathe air in shallow-water conditions.

Life and painting  Tjungurrayi was born near Puntujarrpa, west of Kiwirrkurra, in Central Australia. He grew up on Pintupi county, alongside the Canning Stock Route, and encountered 'no white man' until he was a young man and a helicopter flew nearby and terrified him and his family: this included his brother Tjuwi who became known as 'helicopter'. Following this Tjungurrayi and his family had many interactions with 'the white man' and there was a lot of violence and Tjungurrayi can remember many killings. Soon after this he moved to Balgo where they stayed until the establishment of the first Pintupi homelands community, Kintore, in the early 1980s; although Patrick always travelled between the two as well as to a number of other communities throughout the region where he was a labourer, building the houses that would become the community. By 1986 the labouring became too hard and he settled in Balgo and committed his time to painting with Warlayirti Artists until he moved to Kiwirrkurra where, from 1993, he painted for Papunya Tula Artisits. By the late 1990s Tgungurrayi was refining his vision and creating increasingly powerful paintings, which coincided with a decrease in the use of pigment, Colour was, however, reintroduced after the flooding and evacuation of Kiwirrkurra in 2000, immediately following this he painted the land inundated of a mythic scale with the use of colour. He has experimented and changed his style a number of times since.  Work with Purple House  Between 2007 and 2010 Tjungurrayi's kidneys started to fail and this encouraged him to once again advocate for his people and stand against the inadequate health services Central Australia and the Western Desert more specifically. This wasn't new to Tjungurrayi who had already contributed paintings to the Art Gallery of New South Wales auction in 2000 that gave Purple House its start and enabled people to receive dialysis 'on Country' (their traditional homelands/communities). He was the lead artist in the creation of the \\"Kiwirrkurra Men's Painting\\" which sold for $340,000. Despite all of Purple House's work Tjungurrayi was still unable to receive dialysis in Kiwirrkurra as Purple House was, at that time, not allowed to operate in Western Australia, and, although saddened by this he thought he would, at the very least be able to receive treatment in Kintore or Alice Springs. Instead he was told that due to high demand people not from the Northern Territory would have to travel elsewhere and he was asked to go to, and because of the intensity of treatment, essentially move to Kalgoorlie or Perth. Tjungurrayi refused and said he would \\"rather die on his own Country then be sick on somebody else's\\". Tjungurrayi grew up travelling the desert country that his ancestors had walked for thousands of years and he could not respect the artificial borders that were now defining his life. Tjungurrayi fought for his right to receive treatment more local and spoke to many people, including government agencies and he was finally able to receive treatment in Alice Springs and now, with his help, Purple House (who were previously not allowed to operate in Western Australia) have established a two chair dialysis unit at Kiwirrkurra in 2014. It is Tjungurrayi's aim to raise public and political awareness about the renal health crisis facing Aboriginal people.

He was the son of a well-known Dutch cellist Isa√§c Mossel (Rotterdam, 1870 ‚Äì Amsterdam, 1923) and pianist Jeannette Belinfante (1868-1925).Herman Openneer (1935-2017), 1993. He spent his youth with his parents in Laren in the Netherlands, where he lived on the Velthuijsenlaan.The family house on the Velthuijsenlaan 19, Laren. At a young age he was taught to play the piano. His father stimulated his love for jazz. In 1923 Mossel played as a drummer and pianist in the ‚ÄúLarensche Jazz Band‚Äù. A couple of years later he formed his own jazz band ‚ÄúThe Indian Jazz Band‚Äù. In 1931 Mossel was employed by the German violinist and bandleader Marek Weber and moved to Germany.Herman Openneer (1935-2017), 1993. Because he was Jewish, Weber was targeted by the Nazis who wanted to suppress the so called degenerate music (German: Entartete Musik), a label which had also been applied to jazz music. This was meant to isolate, discredit and ultimately ban this form of music. Towards the end of 1932 Marek left Germany and travelled via London to the United States. Mossel returned to the Netherlands. The last ten years from 1935 until 1944 Hans Mossel was considered to be among the most notable clarinetists and saxophonists performing in Europe.Herman Openneer (1935-2017), 1993. In 1935 Mossel was employed by the Dutch broadcasting company the AVRO as a bandleader for the AVRO Dance Orchestra.Avro Dance Orchestra with band leader Hans Mossel. In 1939 Mossel married Ada Elizabeth van Ollefen. They had two children. Shortly after the beginning of World War II life became very difficult for Hans Mossel. Although married to a non-Jewish woman, he was forced by the Nazis to fill bomb craters at Schiphol airport, which was used as a German military airfield called Fliegerhorst 561 and as a result regularly attacked by the Allied Forces. On 13 December 1943, 199 American planes dropped about 1600 bombs (about 400.000 kilos) on Fliegerhorst 561, after which it could no longer be used by the Germans. On the basis of a trumped-up case of sabotage Hans Mossel was deported in 1943 to the Monowitz concentration camp, which was part of the Auschwitz concentration camp in occupied Poland. Here Mossel was murdered on 4 August 1944.

He is a professor of the PLA Naval University of Engineering. He is an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and holds the military rank of rear admiral. He led the development of the electromagnetic catapult system for the Type 003 aircraft carrier and the development of electromagnetic railguns. In 2017, he was awarded the Order of August First, the highest honour of the People's Liberation Army. Biography Ma was born in April 1960 in Yangzhong, Jiangsu, China. He graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering of PLA Naval University of Engineering in Wuhan with a BS degree in 1982 and an MS degree in 1987. He earned his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University in 1996. Ma is Professor and Director of the Institute of Power Electronic Technique Application at the Naval University of Engineering. In 2001, he was elected a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) at the age of 41, making him the youngest academician of the CAE. He also serves as Vice President of the China Association for Science and Technology. Considered a top naval engineer in China, he holds the military rank of rear admiral. Ma was elected an alternate member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 2012 and the 19th Central Committee in 2017. In November 2019, he was promoted to full member at the Fourth Plenum of the 19th Central Committee.  Contributions  Ma has led the development of China's electromagnetic catapult system for launching aircraft from carriers (similar to the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System of the United States), which is more efficient than the older steam catapult system. It is expected to be deployed on the Type 003, the PLA Navy's third aircraft carrier, which would make China the second country to develop the technology, after the US. In January 2019, Chinese media reported that Ma's team had developed electromagnetic railguns capable of firing projectiles at very high velocity, with longer range and higher accuracy than traditional artillery. Military observers expect a modified version of the Type 055 destroyer to be equipped with the railgun, which would make China the first country to deploy the weapon on an actual warship. Ma is also credited for silencing noise of the PLA Navy's submarine's propulsion system thus making them less detectable on sonar. Since the late 1980s, Ma has advised more than 400 masters and doctoral students. Two of them, Xiao Fei and Wang Dong, were awarded rare peacetime First-Class Merit Awards by the PLA for their research.

This location has been the site of religious debate. It was founded by Agha Najafi Isfahani and Haj Aqa Nourollah Najafi Isfahani in 1902. The Christian missionaries and representatives of the Muslims used to discuss there. This place was one of the first centers of conversation between religions and cultures. Anjoman-e Safakhaneh is considered by some to be one of the first structured places designed for the discussion of religion. Haj Agha Nurollah Najafi, a prominent and influential cleric of Isfahan's constitution ordered its construction in the years before the Persian Constitutional Revolution in the Jolfa neighborhood of Isfahan to counter Christian propaganda against Islam at that time. Anjoman-e Safakhaneh was a safe place for scientific, rational and religious debate. It offered discussion without insult. History Christian missionaries who had traveled from Europe to India, learned Persian, and published books against Islam, came to Isfahan and began a struggle against Islam. Their leader was called Tizdal. He took up residence in the Jolfa neighborhood of Isfahan and invited scholars of Isfahan to debate. He published a book on the rejection of Islam called Janabi al-Islam. Agha Najafi Isfahani and Haj Aqa Nourollah tried to argue with them. In cooperation with Roknolmolk Shirazi, Dai-al-Islam was appointed to discuss them. While electing one person to debate Christianity's ideas and missionaries, Isfahan scholars, led by Agha Najafi Isfahani and Haj Agha Nourollah, formed a community called the Safakhaneh association in the Jolfa neighborhood. Al-Islam magazine The first issue of Al-Islam was published three months after the establishment of the Anjoman-e Safakhaneh, in September 1903. The magazine published the work of the Anjoman-e Safakhaneh. The magazine described the debate between Shia scholars and Christian missionaries. It was widely used by Muslim thinkers to confrontation Christianity and other religions. This magazine was published by the editor of Mohammad Ali Da'i al-Islam, and its publication was sent to other cities and countries such as Egypt, India, Hejaz and Ottoman Empire, even to Muslims living in Europe. They used it to prove the power of Islamic reasoning and rationality. The publication of Al-Islam at the second decade in Persian and Urdu created a new wave of coexistence and rational dialogue between Islam and other religions. Anjoman-e Safakhaneh The significance of the Safakhaneh association stems from the fact that it formed to confront the negative propaganda from Tizdal and another group of Christian preachers. Ayatollah Najafi preferred to treat them with respect and courtesy.

Basal cells are the stem cells or progenitors of the airway epithelium and can differentiate to replenish all of the epithelial cells including the ciliated cells, and secretory goblet cells. This repairs the protective functions of the epithelial barrier. Basal cells are cuboidal with a large nucleus, few organelles, and scattered microvilli. Basal cells are the first cells to be affected by exposure to cigarette smoke. Their disorganisation is seen to be responsible for the major airway changes that are characteristic of COPD. Structure Cells of the respiratory epithelium. Basal cells shown in purple, ciliated cells shown in brown, goblet cells shown in green, and submucosal gland shown in blue. Basal cells are cuboidal, with a large nucleus, few organelles, and scattered microvilli. Basal cells are attached to, and line the basement membrane. The numbers of basal cells are highest in the large airways and become increasingly decreased in the smaller airways. Their percentage in the trachea is 34%, in the large bronchi 27%, and 10% in the larger of the bronchioles. Basal cells can express a number of different receptors, notably EGFR. Basal cell derived precursors are found as intermediate cells (also known as parabasal, or indetermined cells) between the basal cells and the differentiated cells. Function Basal cells are the stem cells, or progenitors of all the cells in the respiratory epithelium. The ciliated cells and secretory cells that form the epithelial barrier, and function in mucociliary clearance, are terminally differentiated meaning that they cannot self-renew. These cells are vulnerable to damage and the basal cells can replace damaged cells by differentiation. Typically the airway epithelium turns over fairly slowly with the basal cells in a quiescent state, and just a few intermediate cells being seen. In response to damage to the differentiated cells, or to stress caused by smoking, the basal cells become active, proliferate, and form clonal patches, and the numbers of intermediate cells increase. When activated the basal cells acquire damage-associated phenotypes to enable differentiation to the particular cell type that has been damaged. The intermediate cells differentiate under the control of FOXJ1 into ciliated cells; and into secretory cells under the control of Notch signalling, and the transcription factors SPDEF and FOXA3. The regeneration of cells can be normal or in the case of smokers the regeneration may be of altered histologic phenotypes. Basal cells can also provide a defence function upregulating innate immune mediators such as RNase7, an antimicrobial protein. RNase7, mediates tissue repair, and the production of inflammatory cytokines induced either by tobacco smoke, or by microbial pattern recognition. Basal cells are the chief cells producing RNase7. This is seen as a possible defence response of basal cells to injury that would be associated with microbial attack. The response requires signalling via EGFR, which is highly expressed in basal cells. Other innate immune mediators include beta-defensin 2, and lipocalin-2; pro- inflammatory cytokines, interleukins IL6, and IL8; and chemokine CCL20. The actual recognition of microbial patterns takes place in the secretory and ciliated cells via Toll-like receptors, and this can stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of basal cells to repair the damaged tissue. =Dysfunction= SEM image of syncytial virions taken from A549 cells in the lung epithelium. Following injury to airway epithelium, the basal cells can become infected by the respiratory syncytial virus. When this happens the basal cell can be skewed to favour the differentiation of mucous-producing (secretory cells) over that of ciliated cells. The normal ratio of ciliated cells to secretory cells is 10 to 1, and this is highly controlled throughout most of the respiratory tree. When this ratio is upset in this way, the effect is of generating the mucus hyperplasia associated with a number of respiratory diseases, due to the insufficient ciliary action needed for mucociliary clearance. The release of antimicrobials may occur as a second-line defence with cell differentiation. Disruption of the tight-junction barrier is a common feature of asthma, and of smoking-related respiratory diseases. The persistent activation of the innate immune response in basal cells, may contribute to the characteristic chronic inflammation seen in these disorders. Clinical significance The hyperplasia of airway basal cells is the earliest indication of smoking-related abnormality in the lung. This is followed by shortened cilia, loss of ciliated cells, mucous cell hyperplasia, and loss of cell junctions giving a leaky epithelial barrier. With persistent stress from smoking, the basal cells become disarranged and lose their regenerative ability needed to repair the barrier. The disorganised basal cells are seen to be responsible for the major airway changes that are characteristic of COPD, and with continued stress can undergo a malignant transformation. Studies have shown that the initial development of emphysema is centred on the early changes in the airway epithelium of the small airways. Basal cells become further deranged in a smoker‚Äôs transition to clinically defined COPD. Image showing the accumulation of mucus in the airways. Basal cell dysfunction causes the overproduction and secretion of mucus, and decreased mucus clearance that leads to the characteristic features of mucus hypersecretion, and productive cough of chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mucus accumulation in COPD influences lung function, quality of life, exacerbations, hospital stays, and mortality, for the worse.

It was established in September 2018 in temporary accommodation, with the first cohort of Year 7 pupils. It is part of the Leigh Academies Trust.  Background  The Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) approved the school in January 2015, and eighteen potential sites were considered. Plans were submitted for the former Blackheath Bluecoat site, with detached playing fields in Hervey Road during July 2018. The Leigh Academies Trust runs 23 academies along the A2 corridor incorporating many larger than average secondaries. In an interview a previous chief executive, Frank Green explained the small schools model of education as a way to prevent students from dropping out, and vertical tutor groups as a way that allows students to be supported by peers a couple of years their senior. The trust creates largely autonomous schools within the school- analogous to houses in former times. In its consultation documents for the proposed school, the small school model is mentioned. The Leigh Academies Trust is an enthusiastic proponent of the IB, (International Baccalaureate) adopting the Learner Profile, and offering an IB Middle Years Programme compliant curriculum within its secondary schools.  Interim school  The school opened on a temporary site, the old army site on Shooters Hill Road in September 2018 with the first Year 7 cohort of 180 students and 45 staff. In September 2019 it moved, with Year 7 and Year 8 into custom built temporary buildings on its new site, the land of the former Blackheath Bluecoat School. It had to wait for possession until the St Mary Magdalene School, which was occupying the Bluecoats buildings moved to it≈õ permanent home on the Greenwich Peninsula. The Bluecoats building will be demolished in preparation for the new school.  Building  Bouygues were appointed as the construction partner, and designed a standards compliant, sustainable building. It will be of a standard 3-storey (75m x 45m) block design with sports- facilities in a smaller attached single storey (33m x 18m) block. Leigh divides its pupils in to colleges, similar to houses. Each college will have its own set of classrooms, open spaces, toilets and staff working areas. Pastorally the pupils are split into vertical tutor groups within those colleges. The pupils share flexible library space, the specialist teaching areas, the studio and hall By comparison with a similar building in Rainham, Kent, the main 3 storey block will have a figure eight like structure, being built around two internal courtyards or atria. One houses the school hall and activity studio and is two storeys high- the other is larger and three storeys in height and is used as the dining area. The specialist teaching areas are around the hall and the general classrooms and staff rooms are around the dining atrium. The layout of the three floors here is identical, and these floor will house each of the ¬¥small schools within a school' colleges.  Curriculum  Leigh Academy Blackheath has academy status so does not have to apply the National Curiculum. Instead it looks to the International Baccalaureate MYP programme (Middle years programme) in its two-year Key stage 3 phase. It is proposing to offer the L, A and B pathways. In common with all Leigh Academies Trust IB schools, and schools worldwide it has a philosophy that all students should: * Enjoy equal access * Develop basic skills and specialist digital skills * Develop creative thinking and problem solving throughout the learning process. It offers its students in its care * the means to reach their full potential * the challenge to work in partnership and collaboration with industry * the means to become powerful digital citizens by learning to use the technology and to use it to learn.

Early life  Kruger was born on the banks of the Katherine River at a place called Donkey Camp, the son of Franz (Frank) Kruger and Yrambul Nungarai a Mudburra woman, Kruger is one of their two children and the couple stayed together until Frank's death in 1938. No specific records were kept but it appears that Kruger was taken from his family in mid-1928, alongside his sister Gladys, as a toddler and they were placed in the Kahlin Compound in Darwin. For Yrambul this is not the first time she had had children taken away from her and, despite knowing it was useless, she still followed the children to Darwin and stood outside the gates every day until, finally, she had to return home and to her remaining children (who were not take away as their father was Mudburra). In addition to Gladys, Kruger already had two sisters a Kahlin; Ada and Alice. When Kruger was six, in September 1931, he was moved to Pine Creek Home, in Pine Creek, along with 27 other boys and, from all accounts, it was a much better place then Kahlin. However, he was separated from his sisters and would not see them again until the end of World War II. Kruger was moved again in 1933, to The Bungalow in Alice Springs, with 33 of the boys from the Pine Creek Home when it closed; he was now even further away from his family. Kruger said of The Bungalow in his book Alone on the Soaks: > \\"Anyone going out to see the Telegraph Station these days is not going to > get much of a picture of what the place looked like when I first saw it. > They've ripped down all the thrown-together tin dormitories and the other > shacks and sheds that were everywhere. There are lawns where there used to > be just bulldust and rubbish. As it's presented today you might think it was > a really nice place. Why are all of us complaining? Well in my time, it > wasn't very nice at all.

At The Bungalow classes were very large and Alec spent most of the time outside for misbehaving and he was still illiterate when he left at the age of 10. Kruger left The Bungalow at the age of 10, in 1935, when he was selected, out of a line-up by the Bloomfield's from Loves Creek Station. Kruger says that most slaves got it better then he did at there and that, despite many promises, no wages were ever paid to him.  Working life  When Kruger discovered that he had not being paid, and had little chance of being so, he ran away and enlisted in the army where he would get to fight for his country and earn good money (equal pay). Kruger was 17 but he told the recruiters that he was 18 and he was placed in the Aboriginal Unit and mostly worked loading trucks. Following the war, he reconnected with his family and spent a brief period living with them in Katherine where he had many roles across the Northern Territory before retiring at 65 in 1989.  High Court  In 1997 Kruger went to the High Court to testify that mixed-race children were systematically removed from their parents in the Northern Territory and this case, Kruger v Commonwealth, which became known as the Stolen Generation Case. In this case, the High Court rejected a challenge to the validity of legislation applying to the Northern Territory, namely the Aboriginals Ordinance 1918, between 1918‚Äì1957. In the wake of this decision the Stolen Generation Association was established in Alice Springs and Kruger was a part of the management committee.  Death  Kruger died 20 February 2015.

History  The school was founded in 2014 following a ¬£12m donation by the James Dyson Foundation to the college, being the first new engineering division at Imperial for two decades. In 2018, the school moved into the newly-christened Dyson Building on Exhibition Road. The building was once the London headquarters of the Met Office, from 1910 to 1919, with some of the original interiors and signage preserved inside the entrance from Exhibition Road. Since then it has had various other uses, including as part of the Science Museum, which adjoins the building to the south, and as a post office. The renovation of the building was undertaken by Pascall+Watson, and cost ¬£14 million.
