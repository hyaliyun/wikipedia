A week of hard-fought actions that began on 29 July and ended on 4 August resulted in the retreat of Quasdanovich's badly mauled force. The elimination of Quasdanovich's threat allowed Bonaparte to concentrate against and defeat the main Austrian army at the Battle of Castiglione on 5 August. Lonato del Garda is located near the SP 668 highway and the Brescia-Padua section of Autostrada A4 to the southwest of Lake Garda. On 29 July, the Austrians advanced out of the Alps to capture the towns of Gavardo and Sal√≤ on the west side of Lake Garda. The Austrians followed up this success by surprising and seizing the French base at Brescia on 30 July. An Austrian brigade captured Lonato del Garda on the 31st but was ejected from the town by a French counterattack after tough fighting. Also on the 31st, a French division briefly recaptured Sal√≤, rescued a small band of compatriots, and fell back. This series of combats and other battles east of Lake Garda compelled Bonaparte to raise the Siege of Mantua. Leaving only one division to observe the main Austrian army to the east, Bonaparte assembled overwhelming force and recaptured Brescia on 1 August. Quasdanovich regrouped around Gavardo on 2 August, while ordering an attack by several columns for the next day. On 3 August, one of the Austrian columns defeated a French brigade and captured Lonato for the second time. However, the French also attacked that day, capturing Sal√≤ and nearly taking Gavardo. With most of the Austrian forces placed on the defensive, Bonaparte massed against the solitary brigade in Lonato and crushed it. This disaster caused Quasdanovich to order a retreat on 4 August. In a final calamity, one withdrawing Austrian column was cut off and captured.  Background  At the end of July an Austrian army set out from Trento with the purpose of relieving the besieged fortress of Mantua. While the main army under Field Marshal Dagobert von Wurmser drove south down the upper Adige River valley to the east of Lake Garda, the Right Column under Quasdanovich struck on the west side of Lake Garda. This 18,000-strong corps consisted of four mixed (cavalry and infantry) brigades led by General-Majors Peter Karl Ott von B√°tork√©z, Heinrich XV, Prince of Reuss-Plauen, Joseph Ocskay von Ocsko, and Johann Rudolph Sporck.Fiebeger, p. 13 The Right Column also included two advanced guards, led by Obersts (colonels) Franz Joseph, Marquis de Lusignan and Johann von Klenau. Bonaparte did not believe that major Austrian forces were capable of operating in the mountains west of Lake Garda.Fiebeger, p. 10 Consequently, only General of Division Pierre Francois Sauret's 4,500-man division defended the area, with garrisons in Sal√≤ on the western shore of the lake, Gavardo on the Chiese River west of Sal√≤, and Desenzano del Garda at the southwestern corner of the lake. The French held Brescia with only three companies of infantry.  Operations See Castiglione 1796 Campaign Order of Battle for a detailed list of French and Austrian units.  West of Lake Garda  Sal√≤ and Lake Garda On 29 July, Ott's brigade attacked Sal√≤ while Ocskay's brigade moved against Gavardo. General of Brigade Jean-Baptiste Dominique Rusca was warned by a village curate of Austrian descent, but chose to disregard the information. Consequently, the Austrians took Sauret's division by surprise. The French general withdrew to Desenzano after a stiff fight in which 500 Frenchmen and two cannons were captured. At Sal√≤, General of Brigade Jean Joseph Guieu and 400 men took refuge in the Palazzo Martinengo where they were blockaded by Ocskay's soldiers.Boycott-Brown, p. 380 Receiving a report that Brescia lay open to attack, Klenau advanced in the night with two squadrons of the Wurmser Hussar Regiment # 30, one battalion of DeVins Infantry Regiment (IR) # 37, and one company of the Mahony J√§gers. The next morning, under cover of fog, he seized the city in a coup de main. The Austrians captured 600‚Äì700 able-bodied soldiers plus 2,000 more in the hospital. Among the prisoners were Colonels Jean Lannes, Joachim Murat and Fran√ßois √âtienne de Kellermann. Quasdanovich soon arrived at Brescia with the brigades of Reuss and Sporck.Boycott-Brown, p. 382 At the same time, Ott's brigade advanced south from Sal√≤ and Gavardo to reach Ponte San Marco, where the Brescia-Verona highway crosses the Chiese just west of Lonato. Ocskay's troops besieged the French soldiers trapped in Sal√≤. That night, Bonaparte determined to give up the Siege of Mantua and concentrate his main strength against Quasdanovich while subsidiary forces held Wurmser at bay.Fiebeger, p. 10.  \\"First\\" Battle of Lonato  On 31 July Ott's brigade at San Marco advanced to the east on Lonato. The Austrian general led two battalions of the Kheul Infantry Regiment Nr. 10, four companies of the Johann Jellacic Infantry Regiment Nr. 53, two companies of the Liccaner Grenz Infantry Regiment Nr. 60, and one squadron of the Erd√∂dy Hussar Regiment Nr. 11. The initial attack flushed part of General of Division Hyacinthe Francois Joseph Despinoy's division out of Lonato. As the Hussars chased the fugitives to the east, they were repulsed by two waiting French artillery batteries. General of Division Andr√© Mass√©na with General of Brigade Claude Dallemagne's brigade and Despinoy with Generals of Brigade Nicolas Bertin's and Jean Cervoni's brigades then counterattacked the town. In a tough four-hour fight, the French drove Ott's outnumbered soldiers out of Lonato and pushed them back to San Marco.Voykowitsch, First Battle of Lonato Leaving Oberst-Leutnant Anton Vogel and two battalions to hold Brescia, Quasdanovich advanced with Reuss, Sporck, Klenau, and Lusignan from Brescia to the southeast. He reached Montichiari, south of Lonato, in mid-morning and spent most of the day there. That evening, he returned to San Marco to join Ott, leaving Klenau in Montichiari. Also on 31 July, Sauret marched to Sal√≤ and defeated Ocskay in a pitched battle. The Austrians retreated to Gavardo. Having rescued Guieu and his men, Sauret returned to Desenzano, where he rendezvoused with Mass√©na and Despinoy.Boycott-Brown, pp. 385‚Äì386  1 and 2 August  On 1 August, Bonaparte assembled 12,000 men under Generals of Division Pierre Augereau and Charles Edward Jennings de Kilmaine and moved northwest from Goito toward Brescia, pushing Klenau's weak force before him. Shaken by his setbacks at Lonato and Sal√≤, Quasdanovich ordered all of his troops north to Gavardo. Bonaparte recaptured Brescia without opposition, and was soon joined there by Mass√©na and Despinoy. Klenau moved northeast toward Gavardo to join Quasdanovich.Boycott-Brown, p. 388 Vogel retreated to Caino in the mountains. On 2 August, Quasdanovich regrouped at Gavardo and sent Ocskay's brigade to reoccupy Sal√≤. With Brescia now secure, Bonaparte ordered Mass√©na to San Marco, while Augereau and Kilmaine marched back to Montichiari. Despinoy held Rezzato and Brescia where he was joined by a demi-brigade from Milan. Bonaparte directed Guieu, who replaced the injured Sauret, to march from Lonato to retake Sal√≤ the next day. Forces under Despinoy from Brescia and Dallemagne from Lonato were sent to attack Gavardo.Boycott-Brown, pp. 389‚Äì391  Battle: 3 August   Lonato  During the night, Ocskay at Sal√≤ started south along the lake road. Guieu marched north on an obscure lane, completely missing Ocskay, who reached Lonato's outskirts via Desenzano. Keeping Sporck's brigade to hold Gavardo, Quasdanovich sent Ott and Reuss south on 3 August. Ocskay's brigade attacked Lonato at dawn, defeated BG Jean Pijon's brigade, and captured its commander. Mass√©na, whose division lay between San Marco and Lonato, counterattacked the Austrians from the west at mid-day. Bonaparte directed the battle. Assaulted by the brigades of Pijon (now led by Colonel Jean-Andoche Junot) on the north, BG Claude Victor and BG Antoine Rampon in the center, and BG Jean Lorcet on the south, Ocskay's outnumbered men were driven from Lonato and pursued toward Desenzano. But Junot's men, plus the Guides and the 15th Dragoons, captured Desenzano first, freeing 150 French prisoners from Pijon's morning fight. Hemmed in by his enemies, Ocskay surrendered with the rump of his brigade. The rest scattered across the countryside. During the fighting in Desenzano, Junot suffered severe saber cuts on his head from Austrian cavalrymen.Boycott-Brown, pp. 393‚Äì394  Paitone  Moving from Rezzato, Despinoy attacked Ott piecemeal and was repulsed. After some fighting, the French general withdrew toward Brescia. Doggedly, Dallemagne moved around Ott's east flank and even reached Gavardo twice, but each time the Austrians drove him back. Dallemagne retreated to Brescia, where he reported sick. Casualties and other details of these fights are unknown. Because of the French attacks, Ott did not advance farther south than Paitone, south of Gavardo. At some time during the day, Klenau reinforced Ott. Reuss was sent cross-country to establish contact with Ocskay.Boycott-Brown, p. 392  Desenzano  With his brigade of 1,800 men, Reuss soon appeared at Desenzano, recaptured the town, and rescued a number of prisoners from Ocskay's command. After learning the fate of Ocskay's brigade and finding that Massena's victorious division was closing in on him, Reuss beat a hasty retreat back to Gavardo, harassed by the French. He lost a number of prisoners on his retreat. Others were rescued by Major Gustave Maelcamp's small Austrian flotilla on the lake.Boycott-Brown, p. 394  Sal√≤  Meanwhile, Guieu reached Sal√≤, found it unoccupied, and turned west to menace Gavardo. The French soon came upon and captured Quasdanovich's artillery park. But Sporck counterattacked and recaptured the guns. The day ended with Sporck holding the heights west of Sal√≤ while the French controlled the town. That evening, Quasdanovich ordered Ott to join him on the heights. Reuss turned up with his brigade during the night with the tidings of Ocskay's disaster. A council of war determined to retreat. Having heard nothing from Wurmser, Quasdanovich hoped to rejoin his colleague by marching around the north end of Lake Garda.Boycott-Brown, pp. 394‚Äì395  Castiglione  On the morning of 3 August, Wurmser's 4,000-man advance guard under GM Anton Lipthay lay eight kilometers to the south of Lonato near Castiglione delle Stiviere. The Austrian commander planned to move to Quasdanovich's help, but the French pre- empted him. Augereau launched an enveloping attack on Lipthay with 11,000 soldiers. Despite being greatly outnumbered, Lipthay put up a terrific fight, giving ground only grudgingly. He was, however, forced to abandon Castiglione and fall back southeast toward Solferino. Lipthay's stubborn defense allowed Wurmser time to concentrate his forces. GM Anton Sch√ºbirz marched to the sound of the guns and counterattacked Augereau's left flank near Solferino. FML Paul Davidovich formed his division in support. By the end of the day, Wurmser had the bulk of his 20,000 soldiers on hand. French losses are not known, but BG Martial Beyrand was killed, BG Jean Robert was wounded, and \\"great losses had been suffered by both sides.\\" The Austrians lost about 1,000 casualties, including GM Franz Nicoletti wounded.Boycott-Brown, pp. 396‚Äì397  Battle: 4 August  Quasdanovich issued orders to retreat north toward Lake Idro at 2:00am. In the confusion, one Austrian column found itself cut off from the rest of the corps and made a desperate march to the southeast to reach Wurmser. The Austrians marched into Lonato early in the morning, nearly capturing Bonaparte. Napoleon was at Lonato with only 1200 French against 3,000 Austrians. Napoleon informed the Austrian officer that his \\"whole army\\" was present, and that \\"if in eight minutes his division had not laid down its arms, [he] would not spare a man.\\"Roberts, p. 112Boycott-Brown, pp. 397‚Äì398 Napoleon supported this ruse by issuing orders to his aide-de-camp Berthier about grenadier and artillery units that BerthierRoberts, p. 112 knew were entirely bogus. Oberst Knorr surrendered one battalion each of De Vins IR # 37 and Erbach IR # 42, a total of 2,000 men and 3 cannons.Smith, p. 119 The Austrians only discovered once they had surrendered and been disarmed that there were no French forces nearby, and that they could have captured Napoleon with ease.Roberts, p. 112 Bonaparte sent Guieu to observe the Austrian withdrawal.  Results  In the battles on 3 and 4 August, the Austrians lost 23 cannons and at least 5,000 killed, wounded and captured. French losses were at least 2,000.Smith, p. 119. These losses do not include the fighting at Castiglione. More importantly, Quasdanovich's defeat allowed Bonaparte to mass over 30,000 men against Wurmser's 25,000, resulting in a French victory in the Battle of Castiglione on 5 August. This defeat forced Wurmser to withdraw to Trento and abandon the campaign.  See also  * Siege of Mantua (1796‚Äì1797)  References   Footnotes   Citations  * Boycott-Brown, Martin. The Road to Rivoli.

He was Lord Mayor of London in 1377, and again from 1383‚Äì5. Named a \\"worthie and puissant man of the city\\" by Richard Grafton (who wrongly termed him a draper), he became a citizen and grocer of London, and in 1372-3 purchased(46 Ed. III) from the Malmains family the estates of Mereworth, Maplescomb, and West Peckham, in Kent.The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent, Edward Hasted, i. 290, ii. 258, 264 His ties to Richard ultimately resulted in his downfall, as the anti- Richard Lords Appellant effectively took control of the government and imprisoned, exiled, or executed most of Richard's court. Despite Richard's efforts, Brembre was executed in 1388 for treason at the behest of the Lords Appellant. Becoming Lord Mayor Brembre comes from unknown origins, though he may be related to Sir Thomas Brembre (or Bramber), who served the king from 1347 to 1355. He first appears as an alderman and Sheriff of the City of London in 1372,Letter-book G, f. 293b sitting for the ward of Bread Street, in which he resided.The History of the Twelve Great Livery Companies, William Herbert, i. 328. The citizens were at this time divided into two factions, the party under John Northampton supporting John of Gaunt and John Wycliffe, while that headed by William Walworth and John Philipot supported the opposition and William Courtenay. On the fall of John of Gaunt and his partisans at the close of Edward III's reign (1377), Adam Stable, the then Lord Mayor, was deposed and replaced by Brembre, who belonged to the opposite party. He took his oath at the Tower on 29 March 1377,Annals, John Stow. and was also re-elected for the succeeding year (1377‚Äì8). His \\"Proclamacio ... ex parte ... Regis Ricardi\\" in this mayoralty (as shown by the sheriffs' names) is given in the Cottonian manuscripts.Nero, D. vi. fos. 177b‚Äì9. Political disputes In the parliament of Gloucester (1378) Thomas of Woodstock, the king's uncle, demanded Brembre's impeachment as Lord Mayor for an outrage by a citizen on one of his followers, but the matter was compromised.Memorials of London, Henry Thomas Riley. He now became for several years (at least from 1379 to 1386) one of the two collectors of customs for the port of London, with Geoffrey Chaucer for his comptroller, his accounts being still preserved.Q. R. Customs Bundle, 247 The party to which Brembre belonged had its strength among the greater companies, especially the grocers, then dominant, and the fishmongers, whose monopoly it upheld against the clamours of the populace. It was oligarchical in its aims, striving to deprive the lesser companies of any voice in the city,Commentaries on the History, Constitution, & Chartered Franchises of the City of London, George Norton and was consequently favourable to Richard's policy. At the Peasants' Revolt in 1381, Brembre, with his allies Walworth and Philipot, accompanied the king to Smithfield, and was knighted with them for his services on that occasion.Letter-book H, f. cxxxii; Jean Froissart. Chronicles, cap. 108.

Charges of corruption and tyranny On the outbreak of John Northampton's riot in February 1384, Brembre arrested and beheaded a ringleader, John Constantyn, cordwainer.Walsingham ii. 110-1. Our main knowledge of Brembre's conduct is derived from a bundle of petitions presented to parliament in October‚ÄìNovember 1386 by ten companies of the rival faction, of which two (those of the mercers and cordwainers) are printed in the Rolls of Parliament, iii. 225‚Äì7. In these he is accused of tyrannous conduct during his mayoralty of 1383‚Äì4, especially of beheading the cordwainer Constantyn for the riot in Cheapside, and of securing his re-election in 1384 by increased violence. 'Roll A 27: (i) 1383-85', Calendar of the plea and memoranda rolls of the city of London: volume 3: 1381-1412 (1932), pp. 50-83. Forbidding his opponents to take part in the election, he filled the Guildhall with armed men, who, at their approach, \\"sailleront sur eux ove g≈©nt noise, criantz tuwez, tuwez, lour pursuivantz hydousement.\\" In 1386 he secured the election of his accomplice, Nicholas Exton, who was Lord Mayor at the time of the petition, so that the mayoralty was still, it urged, \\"tenuz par conquest et maistrie.\\" While Lord Mayor (1384), Brembre had effected the ruin of his rival, John de Northampton (who had appealed in vain to John of Gaunt), by his favourite device of a charge of treason;Walsingham ii. 116. and though Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester and the opposition accused him of plottingWalsingham ii. 150. in favour of Suffolk (the chancellor), who was impeached in the parliament of 1386, and of compassing their death, he not only escaped for the time, but at the close of the year (1386) was, with Simon de Burley and others of the party of resistance, summoned by Richard into his council. Through the year 1387 he supported Richard in London in his struggle for absolute power, but was again accused by Gloucester and the opposition of inciting the mayor and citizens against them, when the former (Exton) shrank from such a plot.Walsingham ii. 165, Rolls of Parliament iii. 234 Trial and execution He was therefore among the five councillors charged with treason by the Lords Appellant on 14 November 1387, and, on the citizens refusing to rise for him, fled, but was captured (in Wales, says Jean Froissart) and imprisoned at Gloucester,Writ of 4 January 1388 in Thomas Rymer's F≈ìdera. until on 28 January 1388 he was moved to the Tower.Issue Rolls, 11 Richard II. The Merciless Parliament met on 3 February, and the five councillors were formally impeached by Gloucester and the Lords Appellant.Rolls of Parliament iii. 229‚Äì36 Brembre, who was styled \\"faulx Chivaler de Londres,\\" and who was hated by York and Gloucester,Froissart was specially charged with taking twenty-two prisoners out of Newgate and beheading them without trial at the \\"Foul Oke\\" in Kent.Rolls of Parliament iii. 231. On 17 February he was brought from the Tower to Westminster before Parliament and put on trial. He pleaded \\"guilty of nothing\\" to all charges and claimed trial by battle as a knight, but it was refused. When the king supported him, 305 people in Parliament threw down their gauntlets opposing the king. He was sentenced on 20 February and was ordered to be taken back to the Tower, whence the marshal should \\"lui treyner parmye la dite cite de Loundres, et avant tan q'as ditz Fourches [Tyburn], et ille√µqs lui pendre par le cool\\"Rolls of Parliament iii. 237‚Äì8.

First a mountain stream, the river later flows along with the river Kukhtuy in a wide valley between Yudoma and Kukhtuy Ranges to join the Kukhtuy to form the harbor of Okhotsk, a natural harbour of the Sea of Okhotsk formed by a sand spit. In 1810 the ice-choked river cut a new mouth through the spit at Novoye Ustye. The banks of the river are mostly forested. There is an important salmon run. The lower reaches of the river are navigable for small craft. In the fur hunting trade, since there are no easy portages to the Okhota, the Russians usually approached Okhotsk from the Urak or the Ulya to the west. The only main route that used the Okhota ran from the \\"corner\\" of the Yudoma over the Okhotsk Portage to the Okhota about 100 kilometres north of its mouth. There was some pasture along the river but not enough to keep many Yakutsk pack- horses over winter. Larch was cut and floated down the river for shipbuilding. Around 1750 there were 37 peasant families and from 1735 a few Yakut cattlemen.

The ships were intended to counter a perceived threat posed by Imperial Japanese aggression to the Dutch colonies in the East Indies. Dutch intelligence believed that the Imperial Japanese Navy would deploy its capital ships (aircraft carriers and battleships) against their counterparts of the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy, leaving heavy and light cruisers, along with seaplane carriers, as the largest ships available for an advance into the East Indies. As such, the 1047s were shaped by the need to be able to fight their way through a fleet composed of these ships and smaller destroyers. It was hoped that this capability would allow the battlecruisers to act as a fleet in being. After a recommendation from high-ranking Dutch naval officers that the Koninklijke Marine (Royal Netherlands Navy) be bolstered so any attacker would have to deploy a significant amount of their fleet to the East Indies, keeping it from other theaters of war, the Minister of Defense ordered the Navy to prepare designs for a two or three-member class of battlecruisers. As they had not previously designed a modern capital ship, and the only information available on modern designs came from public literature and editions of Jane's Fighting Ships, the Dutch turned to Germany. This initially bore no results, as the two sides were unable to come to terms. During this time, a preliminary plan was drawn up without foreign assistance; completed on 11 July 1939, it was missing many of the post-First World War advances in warship technology. In particular, the armor protection was completely outmoded. Germany and the Netherlands were eventually able to reach an agreement where Germany would release plans and drawings based upon their ideas for a battlecruiser, in return for a guarantee that all needed equipment would be ordered from German firms. With their assistance (mainly through NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw), a rough design was formulated by February 1940. A visit to Italy prompted a rethink of the internal layout, which led to a set of drawings dated 19 April 1940. This is the last known design produced prior to Germany's invasion and occupation of the Netherlands. Final plans for the ships were never completed, and the ships were never constructed. Background The Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 marked a period of increasing belligerence from the Japanese Empire, and as the decade progressed the Dutch grew concerned about the security of their East Indies colonies.Worth (2002), p. 218 The islands, which included Java, Sumatra, Borneo and part of New Guinea, were enormously important both politically and strategically to the Dutch, who had lived and traded there for more than three centuries. Over 500,000 settlers had moved from the Netherlands to this \\"second homeland\\",Morison (1948), pp. 281‚Äì282 and the East Indies possessed abundant valuable resources, the most important of which were the rubber plantations and oilfields;Morison (1948), p. 280 the islands were the fourth- largest exporters of oil in the world, behind the United States, Iran, and Romania.The statistics given are for 1935. The top five oil exporters in this year were, in order, the United States, with 6,958 kt, Persia (Iran), with 6,860 kt, Romania, with 6,221 kt, the Dutch East Indies, with 5,139 kt, and the Soviet Union, with 3,369 kt.

The Koninklijke Marine had only one seagoing armored ship stationed in the East Indies, the coastal- defense ship (ex-). As this ship was considered to be \\"of little remaining combat value\\", three light cruisers (, and ), a few destroyers, and a large submarine fleet were charged with the main naval defense of the islands.Noot(1980),p 244 The Dutch believed that if war broke out, Japan's capital ships would be preoccupied with the battleships of the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy, meaning that the defenses of the East Indies would need to cope only with Japan's cruisers. However, the ships were more powerful than their Dutch equivalents and Japan would also have the advantage of numbers. It was estimated that by 1944, should no new vessels be ordered, the five light cruisers of the Koninklijke Marine (two of the , which were laid down prior to the First World War, , and two of the ) could be facing 18 heavy and 27 light Japanese cruisers.Gardiner and Chesneau (1980), pp. 174, 187‚Äì191, 387‚Äì389The last , , was not completed until 30 November 1944; 44 cruisers could have been assembled to attack the East Indies in early 1943 if need be. This count also includes two Chinese light cruisers that were captured in 1937 and a planned hermaphrodite cruiser‚Äìseaplane ship (although due to the war, she was completed with a normal catapult and two planes). See and Gardiner and Chesneau (1980), pp. 191‚Äì192 These factors forced the Koninklijke Marine to bolster this force, and so the construction of three \\"super cruisers\\" capable of overpowering cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy was contemplated. The Washington Naval Treaty and London Naval Treaty limited new cruisers of their signatory nations to not more than a 10,000-ton displacement and guns, but as a relatively minor naval power the Netherlands had not been party to the treaties and was not bound by their restrictions. According to Dutch naval intelligence, the Japanese cruisers did not participate in exercises with the main fleet of battleships and fleet carriers, instead operating with seaplane carriers, so it was assumed that the battlecruisers would not have to face overwhelming carrier-based air strikes. Moreover, the presence of these powerful ships‚Äîwhose larger guns could easily out-range any escorting cruisers or destroyers‚Äîwould give the Dutch a fleet in being in the East Indies that could delay or end plans for an amphibious assault for fear that the invasion would be disrupted or the attacking fleet destroyed. Design moored at Den Helder in 1925. The main defense of the East Indies was entrusted to this ship and her fellow cruisers from the 1920s to the Second World War. In 1938, a number of high-ranking naval officers within the Koninklijke Marine gathered to discuss possible improvements to the navy. They concluded that the Dutch should have a navy strong enough to force an enemy to \\"use such a large part of his military potential that there would be an unacceptable weakening of his capabilities in other theaters\\". At this, and a note from the Chief of Naval Staff, the Minister of Defence J.C.C. van Dijk ordered the navy on to begin planning and estimating costs for two or possibly three battlecruisers.Noot (1980), p. 243 The ships formed a key part of a naval rearmament program which was generally called the \\"Dutch Battlecruiser Plan 1939\\". This was to also include the acquisition of at least two destroyers, seven submarines and several motor torpedo boats. Most of these vessels were to be deployed to the East Indies upon completion.Spek (1988), pp. 69, 71, 79 Requirements for the new battlecruiser design were laid down by the navy a day before the order from van Dijk was made; they included the ability to steam for 12 hours at 32 knots, an endurance of 4,500 nautical miles at 20 knots, a maximum of fifteen minutes for the ship to go from 20 to 30 knots, protection for the engine room that would allow the ship to take hits in that area without being slowed, a draft not to exceed 9 meters, and capacity for six weeks' worth of supplies. Desired weaponry was nine 280 mm guns in three triple turrets for the main armament, with each gun capable of firing independently, a dual-purpose secondary armament of 120 mm guns in four twin mounts, and an anti-aircraft battery of fourteen in pairs with centralized fire control. Aircraft were to be two fighters and two reconnaissance aircraft. Specific values were given for each aspect of the design's armor, which featured substantial anti-torpedo and mine protectionThis included \\"anti-torpedo bulkheads extending to double bottom\\" that were \\"able to absorb 53 cm torpedo hits\\". See: Noot (1980), p. 243 and a defense against 28 cm shells and 300 kg bombs.Specific armor values were given in Noot (1980), p. 243; the following is directly quoted from him: * Main belt from aft to forward turret: 250 mm * Remaining waterline belt: 80 mm * Main armored belt: 125 mm * Splinter deck on top of armored deck: 30 mm * Control tower: sides: 300 mm, roof: 150 mm * 28 cm turrets: barbette: 250 mm, front: 300 mm, roof: 150 mm, sides: 100 mm * 12 cm mounts: barbette: 80 mm, front: 80 mm, roof: 125 mm ** to be protected against the effect of 200 kg aircraft bombs and 14 cm shell hits Preliminary designs With no prior experience in building such large ships‚Äîas 1913 plans for 24,650-ton dreadnoughts were never brought to fruition due to the First World WarNo orders were placed nor were any plans for financing the battleships ever made, mostly due to the First World War. The ships were designed by foreign shipbuilders including Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft, Blohm & Voss, and Vickers were invited to submit designs to specifications set by the government. See: Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 366‚Äîand no significant source of information on more modern vessels‚Äîthe only material available being unclassified sources such as Jane's Fighting Ships‚Äîthe Dutch turned to foreign sources for technical assistance.Noot (1980), p. 245Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 154Gardiner and Gray (1984), pp. 363 and 366 As the Dutch lacked the design experience necessary to produce a modern warship, they hoped that the French would release plans of the (pictured) to them. Although they hoped that the French would release plans for their of 'fast battleships', they decided to focus their effort on Hitler's Germany. Informal talks had already been held in Berlin on 24‚Äì25 April 1939 where the Dutch proposed that, in return for the complete plans for the , they would order all of the necessary equipment for their construction program from Germany.Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 153 A draft design was completed without foreign assistance by the Construction Department on 11 July 1939,Noot (1980), p. 247 in Table 1 give the characteristics of this preliminary design as follows: * Displacement: 26,000 t * Draft: 7.45 m * Machinery: Eight boilers (4 √ó 2), four propellers, 160,000 shp able to push the ship at 33 kn * Endurance: 4500 nmi at 20 kn * Side belt: 250 mm tapering upwards to 150 mm and 100 mm * Side belt forward and aft: 100 mm * Main traverse bulkheads: not indicated * Main Armored deck: 125 mm * Upper deck: 15 mm * 28 cm turrets: barbette: 250 mm, front: 300 mm, roof: 130 mm, sides: 100 mm * Underwater protection: double bottom, depth of 100 mm, depth of side protection system: 700 mm, depth of main side belt: 600 mm, longitudinal anti- torpedo bulkheads: 30 mm, one on each side of the ship * Armament was the same as the preliminary and final designs * Two aircraft but it did not reflect the numerous technical developments that had entered capital ship designs after the First World War. In particular, its armor scheme was utterly obsolete, as it lacked any substantial amount of deck armor or good underwater protection; it came closer to the designs of 20 to 25 years previous than to that of a modern warship. Despite German interest in the battlecruiser project, the two sides could not agree on terms. The German delegation insisted that orders placed in their country be guaranteed, with financial compensation to be paid to German companies if the Dutch did not construct the ships. They also refused to release a complete set of plans for the Scharnhorsts. Further complicating negotiations, the Dutch Cabinet, which would have to approve any deal, did not convene during the summer of 1939. While awaiting official approval, Dutch planning went ahead. A contract with Ferrostaal A.G. Essen was drawn up, and on a list of products for purchase in Germany was submitted.Noot (1980), p. 249 gives a full list: * 37,500 tons of armor, which would be delivered between June 1940 and January 1944 (the majority of this to be delivered prior to January 1943) * 18,000 tons of construction material, to be delivered June 1940 through June 1943 (the majority of this to be delivered prior to January 1942) * Nine 28 cm triple turrets and twelve 12 cm twin mounts, to be delivered from spring to late 1943 * Ammunition for both the 28 cm and 12 cm guns, to be delivered from late 1943 through late 1944 * Six catapults, to be delivered from July 1943 through late 1944 * Propeller shafts, to be delivered from late 1941 through late 1943 * Equipment for the propulsion plant, to be delivered from 1940 through 1942 * 15,000 tons of steel for the construction of a floating dry dock, to be delivered during 1942 Two months later, talks were held in Bremen and Berlin (on 13 and 31 July, respectively) in which the Germans agreed to release plans and drawings that, although not specifically of the Scharnhorst-class, would reveal their ideas on battlecruiser design. Delivered on 21 August 1939, these showed various modern protection schemes that could be used in the new battlecruisers. On 4 October, a German admiral previously appointed as a liaison between the two navies asserted that while Germany could not guarantee punctual delivery dates, it could assure the Netherlands that it would pressure the companies to meet the contractual dates and that the Kriegsmarine would not interfere with orders from the same companies. A month later, Ferrostaal A.G. Essen was formally appointed as the Dutch proxy in most of their dealings with Germany; this appointment did not include Germaniawerft.Noot (1980), p. 249 The design of the 1047s was based on the German ; this three-view drawing depicts in December 1943. Work on armament for the new designs was contracted to Germaniawerft; the Dutch met with the company on 31 July 1939 and supplied the characteristics for the main and secondary armament. Turret armor, main armament depression and elevation (¬∞, obtained through the use of hydraulics), and the muzzle velocity for the guns () were all specified. Requirements for the secondary armament included a maximum depression of ¬∞, a maximum elevation of ¬∞, and approximate armor values for their mounts (80 mm front, 150 mm roof, 50 mm sides). The fire control arrangement was discussed on 6 November 1939 with the Dutch company NV Hazemeyer Signaal Apparatenfabriek. By this time the propulsion plant, which was to be built in the Netherlands, was taking shape. Requirements sent out in August 1939 mandated that the ships have eight boiler rooms, four sets of geared turbines, and 180,000 shp. After further improvements, Nevesbu and two German firms (Germaniawerft was responsible for the turbines and Deschimag for the boilers) began sketching preliminary plans. These were then incorporated into two different design studies, one by Nevesbu and the other by NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS). IvS was purportedly a Dutch company linking Dutch and German designers, but in reality functioned as a front company for German interests. Their design was probably based upon a set of plans drawn up by the Ship Construction Office of the German Navy and received in the Netherlands on 31 August. It did not give the propulsion machinery enough space, and it was thought that this design did not provide enough room for magazines. Nevertheless, it was taken into discussions with the Dutch, where the 11 July design was merged with it. IvS came out with one further plan on 11 March 1940, the merits of which were discussed with the Dutch in April of that year.Noot (1980), pp. 249, 253 and 258Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 155 Design studies In December 1939 the two studies produced their design proposals; both were capable of 180,000 shp and both had similar boiler capabilities, but the Dutch design was larger than the German.Noot (1980), p. 253The Dutch design took up , while the German design took up . See: Noot (1980), p. 253 Although it had the advantage of smaller size, the Dutch were concerned that the German design's power plant might not be capable of operating without problems (the Kriegsmarine did indeed face plant problems during the war). However, questions about reliability soon became moot; it was originally believed that around of the ship's length would be required for its propulsion plant, but it was discovered that no more than could be spared if the ship's ammunition was to be behind armor‚Äîand the German design needed , while the Dutch design needed . December also saw real doubts start to creep over the project, as a new Navy Minister had been appointed, and he believed that the Dutch would be better off acquiring a modern version of the old armored cruiser type. Basic characteristics were drawn up for a , standard ship that had nine guns, a belt and a deck. Even though these vessels would have been superior to any -gunned, treaty cruiser, it was felt that too many compromises would be necessary. The belt and deck armor were judged inadequate, but to achieve the same protection as the battlecruiser design would mean no armament could be fitted. The smaller design also did not feature the speed advantage over opponents that the battlecruisers had. For these reasons the Navy \\"strongly recommended against the construction of such a ship\\", and the proposal was abandoned.Noot (1980), pp. 258 and 263 The plan for three battlecruisers was authorized in February 1940; they, along with two light cruisers of the Eendracht class, would be responsible for the main sea defense of the East Indies. The new light cruisers would replace the older , which would then assume the role of gunnery training ships from grossly obsolete ships such as the protected cruiser , which had been laid down more than forty years prior. The authorization of large battlecruisers meant that a new 40,000-ton floating dock would be built and many improvements to their planned base in the East Indies, the naval yard in Soerabaya, would begin. To construct such a ship, a new building way was begun by the Netherlands Construction Company, Ltd..Gardiner and Gray (1980), p. 365Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 158 Germany's refusal to give the Dutch access to plans detailing the design of the Scharnhorsts below the waterline was a major problem. Inexperienced in designing an underwater protection scheme for a ship of this size, the Dutch were forced to turn to Italy for assistance, which allowed a delegation of engineers and naval officers to enter the country in February 1940. Although the Dutch delegation was barred from viewing technical drawings or the battleship , then under construction, possibly to ensure that the details of their Pugliese system remained a secret, they were allowed to visit , toured several shipyards, interviewed the Chief Constructor of the Italian Navy, and received additional information on the Scharnhorsts, the Italians‚ÄîGermany's ally‚Äîknowing some details of the ships.Noot (1980), p. 268 Although the issues the Dutch designers were having with a propulsion system were discussed, the delegation came away from Italy entirely uninspired by the Italians' efforts in that area. On the other hand, the visit provoked a drastic reworking of the internal subdivision of the proposed battlecruisers. The designers got rid of the previously required central longitudinal bulkhead and attempted to raise the double bottom to provide greater protection against magnetic torpedoes. Due to the requirement for a shallow draft, this modification had to be abandoned.Noot (1980), pp. 256 and 268 Last design When another delegation was sent to Germany to discuss the problems with the battlecruisers, the Dutch took their evolving design with them. Dated 19 April 1940, this was the final version prior to the invasion of the Netherlands by Germany; Design 1047 was never fully completed. The normal load displacement was now planned to be around . Although the propulsion was not yet finalized, the requirements had been re-examined in March 1940 to ascertain if 160,000 shp would be enough, taking into account that a plant that would produce 180,000 shp in tropical water would in northern regions produce ca. 200,000 shp‚Äîwarmer waters adversely affect a steam turbine's efficiency. The updated requirements also called for eight Yarrow boilers fitted in four boiler rooms, and four Parsons geared turbines in two engine rooms, to drive four propellers at either 40,000 or 45,000 shp each (40,000 in tropic water conditions, 45,000 in North Sea conditions). Length requirements for the machinery had also been altered, once in early March and again on 20 April 1940; a total length of 79.5 meters was now called for.Noot (1980), pp. 253, 256, 268 and 270Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 156‚Äì158 Armament The main guns of Scharnhorst. The turrets and guns of the 1047s would have closely resembled these. The table of characteristics provided by Lt. Jurrien S. Noot for the 19 April 1940 design does not give any armament specifics, as these likely remained unaltered from the earlier 16 February 1940 drawing. This drawing provided the following: a main armament of nine 283 mm guns, a secondary armament of twelve 120 mm dual purpose guns, and an anti-aircraft defense consisting of fourteen Bofors 40 mm guns and eight Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. Work on the main armament was contracted to Germaniawerft, which based its designs for the turrets, mountings, and guns of the 1047s on the 28 cm SK C/34 used on the Scharnhorst class. With a APC shell, the guns would have had a muzzle velocity of 900 m/s (2,950 ft/s) and a maximum range of ; 120 rounds of ammunition would have been stowed for each gun, and the rate of fire would have been about 2.5 rounds per minute. The guns would have been able to be elevated to a maximum angle of 45¬∞ and trained to 150¬∞, while the loading angle would have been about 2¬∞. Secondary armament was planned to be twelve Bofors guns in dual mounts. It is unclear whether or not these were intended to be an older version of the gun (which had been mounted as the main armament on Dutch destroyers since the 1920s) or an entirely new version, which in reality was developed in the 1940s during the chaos of the Second World War and were unavailable for warships until after the war's end. Detailed specifics such as range or rate of fire are also unknown; had the older gun been used it would in any case have been updated (including the use of dual instead of single half-shield mounts), and the more modern version did not see service until 1950, by which time it incorporated improvements from lessons learned during the war. 40 mm guns seen on the after superstructure of De Ruyter in 1939. It was planned that the 1047s would carry 14 of these weapons in dual mounts. Close-in anti-aircraft defense would have been provided by 40 mm and 20 mm guns. Arguably the best light anti-aircraft gun of the Second World War, the 40 mm Bofors was used for air defense both on land and at sea by many of the countries involved, including the Americans, British, Dutch, Japanese, and Swedish. Produced in the early 1930s, it first entered service with the Royal Netherlands Navy when the cruisers Java and Sumatra were refitted in 1934‚Äì35.Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 367 Before the Second World War, Hazemeyer, a Dutch subsidiary of the German company Siemens & Halske, had devised \\"a very advanced triaxial mounting together with a tachymetric control system\\" for the 40 mm gun. When the Netherlands fell in 1940, this was brought to the UK aboard the minesweeper Willem van der Zaan, where it was copied and put into service as the British Mark IV twin mount. The description of the proposed fire control mechanism for the 1047s, discussed on 6 November 1939, mentions that the 40 mm weapons were \\"to be controlled autonomously from the gun positions\\"; this seems to describe Hazemeyer's system, but no direct link is made in sources. The Dutch Navy had already acquired a quantity of the Hispano Suiza 20mm guns before the war for mounting in torpedo boats and other craft and 6 of these were mounted in the cruiser Jacob van Heemskerck when she made her escape to Britain in 1940. The Hispano fired similar 20 √ó 110 ammunition to the Oerlikon but had a higher rate of fire and slightly higher muzzle velocity. The Hispano Suiza was insufficiently durable for shipboard use and later became a highly successful aircraft gun.  Differences from the Scharnhorst class  Despite their superficially similar appearance, there were many differences between the Scharnhorst class and the final incarnation of the Dutch design. The 1047 was inferior in its armor protection, but in other respects was far superior: the main guns could be elevated ¬∞ higher, the anti-torpedo system was thicker, the deck protection better accommodated the ship boilers, the quadruple-screw design increased redundancy, and the design did not make use of the problematic German high-pressure power plant. In addition, the 1047s' anti- aircraft armament was far superior to the Scharnhorst class. The use of twelve dual purpose guns‚Äîable to function in both anti-surface and anti-aircraft roles‚Äîas opposed to the German division between anti-surface guns and anti- aircraft guns, was a more effective solution, as it saved needed space and weight on the ships in addition to simplifying logistics by requiring just one size of secondary ammunition. Fate With the outbreak of the Second World War, almost all design work was halted, although work on turrets and gunnery arrangements by Germaniawerft's designers continued until the German invasion of the Netherlands in May. The first 1047-class ship was scheduled to be completed in 1944, so would in any case have been too late to stop the Japanese advance into the Dutch East Indies. Due to the war, final plans for the ships were never completed, and the ships were never constructed.

Negretti is the co-founder and former executive director of ¬øOiste?, a Latino political organization that works to increase the participation of Latinos in politics and public policy making in the United States. Giovanna received the 2008 New Frontier Award by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation and the Institute of Politics at Harvard, which honors young Americans who are changing their communities ‚Äì and the country ‚Äì through their commitment to public service. She was awarded for her contribution to advocacy and grassroots activism in the Latino community. She was also selected by the Hunt Alternatives Fund for its Prime Movers program, a fellowship for new leaders. In 2010, Giovanna received an Eisenhower Fellowship. Early life Born in Puerto Rico, Negretti learned early on the use of a thick skin combined with compassion and persistence. From 1941 through 2001, her family's native island of Vieques was under US military control, its lands expropriated from the native inhabitants and used as a shooting range and dumping ground for non-conventional weapons by the US Navy. She witnessed the devastation to communities and the fragile ecological foundation of her island growing up and learned how to organize, protest and challenge authority effectively through the actions of those around her and later through her own advocacy at University. Though from humble beginnings, Negretti graduated magna cum laude from Emerson College with a bachelor's degree in fine arts and holds a master's degree in public administration from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Career In 1992 Negretti moved to Massachusetts to attend college and went on to work as senior legislative aide for State Senator Dianne Wilkerson at a time when there was no visible Latino political leadership. She has since been active in a number of political campaigns include those of President Barack Obama, Howard Dean and Deval Patrick. Noticing lack of impact by those most affected by redistricting, bilingual education, clean elections and civic participation, Negretti began working on a grassroots level to insure all citizens achieved a voice in the policies affecting them and their lives. This involved digging in and getting involved with Latinos, women and people of color and shepherding them through the political process through education, training, coaching and direct involvement. Negretti both teaches and maintains involvement. Grassroots programs she's assisted in creating, supporting or mentoring include: National Congress for Puerto Rican Rights, Massachusetts Chapter of the National Boricua Human Rights Networks. By 1997, Negretti successfully organized several rallies and demonstrations in Washington, D.C. and elsewhere, including a National Day of Solidarity with the People of Vieques in 2000. In 1999 she co-founded and became the executive director of ¬øOiste?, a US-based NGO with a mission to advance the political, social and economic standing of Latinos. Through its programs in leadership development, civic education, campaign training and advocacy, over one hundred clients have gone on to serve in government, causes and other political actions. Highlights Negretti has been profiled and quoted on mainstream media outlets nationally and internationally on matters relative to leadership, public policy, politics, and public service, is listed as one of the 100 Most Powerful Women in Boston (May 2003). In 2008, Negretti was presented the prestigious New Frontier Award by Caroline Kennedy on behalf of the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and the JFK Library Foundation. She was also honored as the 2008 Prime Mover recipient, a national program that supports leaders who engage masses of people to create a more just society. In January 2010, Negretti was selected as one of nine Eisenhower Fellows thus allowing her to expand her global work and study the impact of identity as it relates to political participation. Over the past several years Negretti has consulted with Dominican Republic President Leonel Fern√°ndez, worked with Sapientis, a non-profit organization focused on education in Puerto Rico. Additional work in South and Central America has focused on environmental issues and their impact on the local population. In the Middle East and Southeast Asia she's worked with Feminist School and Change for Equality and other activist groups dedicated to securing women's rights in Iran. In Malaysia she designed and implemented candidate training for participants attending the Women's Islamic Initiative in Spirituality and Equality Conference for the American Society for Muslim Advancement. In Europe she provided leadership training to young professionals seeking access to EU institutions, programs and funds via EU Access.

The tenth named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season, Wukong developed out of a tropical depression over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. On August 13, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the depression as a tropical storm. The storm traveled along a curving path south of Japan, absorbing the remnants of Tropical Storm Sonamu on August 15 before turning towards the west. Wukong made landfall at peak intensity late on August 17 near Miyazaki City in southern Ky≈´sh≈´. The cyclone remained over land for about 24 hours before moving out over the Sea of Japan. The storm weakened to a tropical depression before dissipating on August 21\\\\. Due to the slow movement of the storm, it produced heavy rains, peaking at 516 mm (20.3 in). Two people were killed due to rough seas produced by the storm and three others were injured. Meteorological history On August 12, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring a tropical depression located to the south of Chichi-jima island. The depression formed within a monsoonal gyre which also spawned Tropical Storm Sonamu. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 11W several hours after the JMA while the system was located about 140 km (85 mi) south of Iwo Jima. The depression gradually strengthened as it moved towards the northwest. Early on August 13, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Wukong; a name which was contributed by China. The names means \\"the king of the monkeys\\" and was featured in the novel Journey to the West. The storm slowed significantly as a ridge built eastward over Japan. On August 14, Wukong turned towards the northeast and reached its peak intensity with winds of 95 km/h (60 mph 10-minute winds) as a severe tropical storm. At the same time, the JTWC assessed Wukong to have reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 95 km/h (60 mph 1-minute winds). The next day, the storm began to accelerate due to an interaction with the nearby Tropical Storm Sonamu. Wukong absorbed the weakening Sonamu later in the day before turning towards the west. On August 16, the storm turned towards the northwest due to a weakness in the ridge near Japan. Wukong made landfall late on August 17 near Miyazaki City in southern Ky≈´sh≈´. As the storm made landfall, the JTWC assessed Wukong to have winds of 100 km/h (65 mph 1-minute winds). The cyclone slowly traveled across land, entering the Sea of Japan about 24 hours after landfall. Several hours after entering the Sea of Japan, the JMA downgraded Wukong to a tropical depression. The depression persisted for two more days before dissipating near the Russian coastline. Preparations and impact Tropical Storm Wukong intensifying on August 14 According to Japanese weather officials, heavy rain, flood, storm and high wave warnings were put into effect for all of Ky≈´sh≈´ and adjacent areas in Honsh≈´. The two largest air carriers in Japan, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, cancelled at least 36 domestic flights ahead of the storm. Several of the largest oil refineries halted oil product shipments from three refineries. Kyushu Railways postponed services on five lines, one of which crossed the entire prefecture. Long distance ferries were also shut down. Iwakuni, Yamaguchi was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness 3 and Sasebo, Nagasaki was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness Storm Watch. Wukong produced torrential rains over Japan, peaking at 516 mm (20.3 in) in Hinokage, Miyazaki Prefecture. Flooding in Ky≈´sh≈´ and the Yamaguchi Prefecture caused the evacuation of about 300 households. At least 200 residences were left without power in Ky≈´sh≈´. Two people were killed by rough seas produced by Wukong, and three others were injured in storm-related accidents. A total of seven landslides occurred, one of which damaged several homes. As the storm brushed the Korean Peninsula, it produced heavy rains, but caused no known damage.

He is a descendant of Shariff Ampatuan, grandson of Syedona Mustafa, a Sufi missionary, which propagated moderate Islam in the Upper Cotabato Valley of Southern Philippines. However rooted in spiritual and ethical traditions, the public image of the Ampatuan clan, to which Datu Zamzamin belonged, was tainted by the infamous 11/23 Massacre at Masalay, Ampatuan, Maguindanao. Authorities pointed to Andal Ampatuan Jr. a.ka. \\"Datu Unsay\\", as the culprit. Datu Unsay's brothers and father, Datu Andal Ampatuan, were detained when Martial Law briefly took effect in Maguindanao as an aftermath of the 11/23 Massacre. Datu Zamzamin have helped tone down the tension by helping convince Datu Unsay to submit to due process of law. He also provided advise to government authorities on how to handle the post-massacre situation to ease the impact on the lives of ordinary people in Maguindanao. Datu Zamzamin, a Civil Engineer by profession and the first Muslim Filipino who have attained the highest rank in the Philippine Civil Service, held various posts as Undersecretary. He once headed the premier national agency attending to Muslim Affairs where he gained prominence as a credible public servant and as a leader of Muslims in the Philippines. Datu Zamzamin became a cabinet member of President Gloria Arroyo being the Lead Convenor of the National Anti-Poverty Commission. He moved back to career positions such as Undersecretary of Agrarian Reform and Energy. In between, he was Chief Executive Officer of government corporations such as Southern Philippines Development Authority and the Strategic Investments Development Corporation. Before joining national government, Datu Zamzamin served in international organizations. In 1998, he was Programme Manager of the United Nations Multi-Donor Programme for the Southern Philippines Zone of Peace and Development. Thereafter, he served as Training Expert for the post-conflict project of the International Labour Organization to help former combatants of the Moro National Liberation Front. He represented the Philippines at the UNESCAP Committee on Poverty where he served as Chair for a one-year term. He has helped promote in Central Asian countries, the use of Community Based Monitoring System, a poverty tracking tool. In the National Elections of 2010, Datu Zamzamin tried his luck in politics having accepted the nomination of a party list for indigenous peoples but the votes garnered is short of required minimum for a seat in the House of Representatives. He is now doing a basic role as Community Leader and Development Advocate for indigenous peoples in Mindanao. True to his Sufi roots, he is a self-taught expert on Islamic Spirituality and Indigenous Muslim Traditions.

It contains Ilonggo serialized novels, short stories, poetry, serialized comics, essays, news features, entertainment news and articles, and many others. Hiligaynon is named after one of the most predominantly spoken language amongst the people of Western Visayas, Negros Occidental and Soccsksargen. Hiligaynon closed during the notorious Martial Law era, but was resurrected in 1989.Leoncio P. Deriada, Hiligaynon Literature, The National Commission for Culture and the Arts Retrieved 26 August 2013 Objective Hiligaynon magazine aims to preserve the rich culture and literature, unique traditions and colorful festivities of the Ilonggo people. History Hiligaynon magazine was first published in 1934. It promotes Ilonggo culture and arts by printing articles in the native language, thus giving non-English Ilonggo readers a better understanding of their own heritage. The birth of Hiligaynon magazine was inspired by the successes of its sister-publications Liwayway magazine, Bisaya magazine and Bannawag founded by Don Ramon Roces of Ramon Roces Publishing, Inc., who also handles the Manila Bulletin.Hiligaynon Retrieved 26 August 2013 During the Second World War, the combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth military ground forces including the local Panay guerrilla resistance fighters was fought against the Japanese Imperial forces led by General Sosaku Suzuki during the Battle for the Liberation of Panay in Western Visayas included the three provinces of Antique (now, Aklan and Antique), Capiz and Iloilo in 1945. It became an overnight sensation and later, its weekly circulation skyrocketed, reaching 60,000 in the early '60s. The first editor in the early 1930s was Abe Gonzales, who was followed by Ulisis Vadlit in the early 1940s. Later on, Francis Jamolangue became the third editor of Hiligaynon magazine in 1966. Under Jamolangue, the staff were Gorgonio Lozarito as managing editor, Pet Vael Jr, Jan Marcella, Ernesto Javellana and Nerio Jedeliz, Jr. Hans Menzi, a war veteran, had acquired Ramon Roces Publication and named it Liwayway Publishing, Inc.. Later on, Francis Jamolangue retired and Atty. Raymundo Defante, from Negros Occidental took the editorship. Then Pet Vael Jr. followed when Defante resigned. However, for no publicly explained reason, Hiligaynon magazine ceased publication in 1973, a year after Martial Law was declared, depriving the Ilonggo people of their cultural and entertainment magazine. At that time, circulation was at its peak, reaching 70,000 copies weekly - printed in full color. In 1992, after 20 years, Hiligaynon magazine was revived when Don Emilio Yap took ownership of Liwayway Publishing, Inc. The revival editor was Quin Baterna with the following staff members: Gaudencio Golez, associate editor; Bebot Daquita, literary editor; Joe Galiza, managing editor, Rex Hidalgo, feature and movie editor; and John Hingco, staff member. After working as editor of the magazine for several months, Quin Baterna transferred the responsibility of editorship to Gaudencio Golez to concentrate on his realty business. When Golez died due to a serious illness, Nerio Jedeliz Jr. assumed editorship and is presently at the magazine's helm. Popular writer The birth of Hiligaynon magazine paved way to discovering prolific Ilonggo writers like Conrado Norada, who later became governor of Iloilo, and Ramon Muzones, who also became an Iloilo city councilor. They wrote romantic novels and inspiring short stories.

It succeeded the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL. The UCLCHM was founded in 2011,Terminal diagnosis for UCL‚Äôs history of medicine centre and from September 2011, it took over some of the former staff of the Wellcome Trust Centre at UCL, including four emeritus academic staff, six teaching staff, and associated staff in a number of other UCL departments. The Centre was based in the UCL Medical Sciences Building in the main UCL campus on Gower Street in the Bloomsbury area of Central London, close to the British Library and University College Hospital. History In 1966, the Wellcome Trust funded the establishment at UCL of a Sub-Department in the History of Medicine, headed by Edwin Clarke, within UCL's Department of Anatomy. The UCL staff also had office space at the Wellcome Library in Euston Road, and academic librarians participated in the teaching and research functions of the UCL department. These cross-institutional arrangements were formalized in 1976 with the creation of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine, the academic staff at the library becoming honorary lecturers at UCL. The Wellcome Institute was closed in 1999, being replaced by a new Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL on the one hand, and the Wellcome Trust Library for the History and Understanding of Medicine on the other, that continued to be a private library owned by the Wellcome Trust. In February 2010 the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL was the first history unit in the world to be nominated for centre collaborative status with the World Health Organization. In April 2010 it was announced that the Wellcome Trust would not be renewing its grant for the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL, and that it would be closed within two years. On 15 March 2011 it was announced that a new research and teaching centre would be launched as the UCL Centre for the History of Medicine for the 2011/2012 academic year, no longer being a flagship Centre funded by the Wellcome Trust. It was announced that the new UCL Centre would relocate from the Wellcome Building on Euston Road to UCL's Medical Sciences Building on Gower Street and that its research focus would be the history of neurosciences and related fields. Closure The UCL Centre for the History of Medicine was wound down and closed during the 2013-2014 academic session. The teaching programmes were transferred to the administration of the UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies. No further students were accepted after the 2013-2014 academic year and Prof. Jacyna has retired from UCL.

Sigurdur Helgason is credited with pioneering the \\"hippie airline\\", Loftlei√∞ir, that made low-cost air travel to Europe possible for generations of Americans  Biography  Born July 20, 1921, in the Icelandic capital, Reykjav√≠k, Sigurdur Helgason came to the United States in his 20s and graduated with a business degree from Columbia University in New York in 1947. He then returned to Iceland, where he managed a cement company. In 1953, Helgason joined the board of Loftlei√∞ir, a small airline that had been formed by three pilots nine years earlier. At the time International Air Transport Association (IATA) controlled its members' fares. As a non-member, Loftlei√∞ir, or Icelandic in English, (as the company was then known) was able to significantly undercut other transatlantic carriers' pricing, and it began service from New York to Luxembourg in 1955. According to Gudjon Arngrimsson, Icelandair's current Vice President for Corporate Communication, Helgason was a \\"very key player\\" in the strategy. Helgason managed the American operations of the company from 1961 to 1973. At that point Loftlei√∞ir was merged with Flugf√©lag Akureyrar to form Icelandair and he returned to Reykjavik to become its CEO. He stepped down as chief executive in 1984, assuming the position of chairman until retirement in 1991. He then lived In Iceland, Mustique, and New York City. Helgason's main interest after retirement were fly fishing and the International House of New York. He leased many rivers across Iceland including the Hofsa. As a member of the International House of New York, he served on the board of directors, where he won the Harry Edmonds Award Helgason died aged 87 in Mustique, the Grenadines, where he spent winters.

The long track hosts both Solo and Sidecar speedway. History In 1968, 1937 Speedway World Champion Jack Milne and motorcycle enthusiast Harry Oxley teamed up to promote motorcycle racing at the Orange County Fairgrounds (OC Fair & Event Center). Interest in motorcycle speedway racing was minimal for the first two years, but the sport soon enjoyed a rapid increase in popularity. When Costa Mesa Speedway opened its doors in the summer of 1969, it was at the height of the surfer craze in Southern California; skateboarding, BMX and motocross were becoming popular with the state's middle class. As such, races at the Costa Mesa Speedway became standing room only at the weekly events by 1971. Top riders including World Champions with 13 titles between them Ivan Mauger (6 times) and Barry Briggs (4 times) from New Zealand and Ole Olson (3 time WC) from Denmark soon made the trip over to challenge the new American speedway riders. In 1981, Orange County native Bruce Penhall won his first Speedway World Championship at the famous Wembley Stadium in England, becoming the first American to do so since Jack Milne in 1937 (Milne had led an American 1-2-3 in 1937, defeating Wilbur Lamoreaux and his younger brother Cordy Milne). Penhall would repeat as World Champion in 1982 when he won at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the only time the World Final was ever held outside of England or Europe before the advent of the Speedway Grand Prix series in 1995. Two other Orange County natives finished in high places in the 1982 World Final, with Dennis Sigalos finishing in third place and Kelly Moran finishing fourth. The popularity of the sport in North America peaked in the late 1970s and remained strong through the end of the century; it has waned somewhat since then. It has remained popular enough to spawn smaller tracks in California, among them tracks in Auburn, Industry and Victorville. European teams closely monitor the talent at these tracks and many riders are recruited by such teams. Costa Mesa Speedway has enjoyed a host of track announcers over the years including Bruce Flanders, current announcer Terry Clanton and Motorcycle Hall of Fame inductee Larry Huffman, well known in Southern California radio markets for his \\"high- powered\\" motorsports advertising.

The geometric designs in Islamic art are often built on combinations of repeated squares and circles, which may be overlapped and interlaced, as can arabesques (with which they are often combined), to form intricate and complex patterns, including a wide variety of tessellations. These may constitute the entire decoration, may form a framework for floral or calligraphic embellishments, or may retreat into the background around other motifs. The complexity and variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and lozenges in the ninth century, through a variety of 6- to 13-point patterns by the 13th century, and finally to include also 14- and 16-point stars in the sixteenth century. Geometric patterns occur in a variety of forms in Islamic art and architecture including kilim carpets, Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, muqarnas decorative vaulting, jali pierced stone screens, ceramics, leather, stained glass, woodwork, and metalwork. Interest in Islamic geometric patterns is increasing in the West, both among craftsmen and artists including M. C. Escher in the twentieth century, and among mathematicians and physicists including Peter J. Lu and Paul Steinhardt who controversially claimed in 2007 that tilings at the Darb-e Imam shrine in Isfahan could generate quasi-periodic patterns like Penrose tilings.  Background  Islamic decoration Islamic art mostly avoids figurative images to avoid becoming objects of worship. This aniconism in Islamic culture caused artists to explore non-figural art, and created a general aesthetic shift toward mathematically-based decoration. The Islamic geometric patterns derived from simpler designs used in earlier cultures: Greek, Roman, and Sasanian. They are one of three forms of Islamic decoration, the others being the arabesque based on curving and branching plant forms, and Islamic calligraphy; all three are frequently used together. Purpose Authors such as Keith Critchlow argue that Islamic patterns are created to lead the viewer to an understanding of the underlying reality, rather than being mere decoration, as writers interested only in pattern sometimes imply. In Islamic culture, the patterns are believed to be the bridge to the spiritual realm, the instrument to purify the mind and the soul. David Wade states that \\"Much of the art of Islam, whether in architecture, ceramics, textiles or books, is the art of decoration ‚Äì which is to say, of transformation.\\" Wade argues that the aim is to transfigure, turning mosques \\"into lightness and pattern\\", while \\"the decorated pages of a Qur‚Äôan can become windows onto the infinite.\\" Against this, Doris Behrens-Abouseif states in her book Beauty in Arabic Culture that a \\"major difference\\" between the philosophical thinking of Medieval Europe and the Islamic world is exactly that the concepts of the good and the beautiful are separated in Arabic culture. She argues that beauty, whether in poetry or in the visual arts, was enjoyed \\"for its own sake, without commitment to religious or moral criteria\\".

A recurring motif is the 8-pointed star, often seen in Islamic tilework; it is made of two squares, one rotated 45 degrees with respect to the other. The fourth basic shape is the polygon, including pentagons and octagons. All of these can be combined and reworked to form complicated patterns with a variety of symmetries including reflections and rotations. Such patterns can be seen as mathematical tessellations, which can extend indefinitely and thus suggest infinity. They are constructed on grids that require only ruler and compass to draw. Artist and educator Roman Verostko argues that such constructions are in effect algorithms, making Islamic geometric patterns forerunners of modern algorithmic art. The circle symbolizes unity and diversity in nature, and many Islamic patterns are drawn starting with a circle. For example, the decoration of the 15th-century mosque in Yazd, Persia is based on a circle, divided into six by six circles drawn around it, all touching at its centre and each touching its two neighbours' centres to form a regular hexagon. On this basis is constructed a six-pointed star surrounded by six smaller irregular hexagons to form a tessellating star pattern. This forms the basic design which is outlined in white on the wall of the mosque. That design, however, is overlaid with an intersecting tracery in blue around tiles of other colours, forming an elaborate pattern that partially conceals the original and underlying design. A similar design forms the logo of the Mohammed Ali Research Center. The logo's construction is demonstrated in an animation on the MOHA website. One of the early Western students of Islamic patterns, Ernest Hanbury Hankin, defined a \\"geometrical arabesque\\" as a pattern formed \\"with the help of construction lines consisting of polygons in contact.\\" He observed that many different combinations of polygons can be used as long as the residual spaces between the polygons are reasonably symmetrical. For example, a grid of octagons in contact has squares (of the same side as the octagons) as the residual spaces. Every octagon is the basis for an 8-point star, as seen at Akbar's tomb, Sikandra (1605‚Äì1613). Hankin considered the \\"skill of the Arabian artists in discovering suitable combinations of polygons .. almost astounding.\\" He further records that if a star occurs in a corner, exactly one quarter of it should be shown; if along an edge, exactly one half of it. The Topkapƒ± Scroll, made in Timurid dynasty Iran in the late-15th century or beginning of the 16th century, contains 114 patterns including coloured designs for girih tilings and muqarnas quarter or semidomes. (subscription required) The mathematical properties of the decorative tile and stucco patterns of the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain have been extensively studied. Some authors have claimed on dubious grounds to have found most or all of the 17 wallpaper groups there. Moroccan geometric woodwork from the makes use of only 5 wallpaper groups, mainly p4mm and c2mm, with p6mm and p2mm occasionally and p4gm rarely; it is claimed that the \\"Hasba\\" (measure) method of construction, which starts with n-fold rosettes, can however generate all 17 groups.

These date from 836 in the Great Mosque of Kairouan, Tunisia, and since then have spread all across the Islamic world.  Middle stage  Middle stage patterns on geometric borders around a alt=Middle stage Islamic patterns The next development, marking the middle stage of Islamic geometric pattern usage, was of 6- and 8-point stars, which appear in 879 at the Ibn Tulun Mosque, Cairo, and then became widespread. A wider variety of patterns were used from the 11th century. Abstract 6- and 8-point shapes appear in the Tower of Kharaqan at Qazvin, Persia in 1067, and the Al-Juyushi Mosque, Egypt in 1085, again becoming widespread from there, though 6-point patterns are rare in Turkey. In 1086, 7- and 10-point girih patterns (with heptagons, 5- and 6-pointed stars, triangles and irregular hexagons) appear in the Jameh Mosque of Isfahan. 10-point girih became widespread in the Islamic world, except in the Spanish Al-Andalus. Soon afterwards, sweeping 9-, 11-, and 13-point girih patterns were used in the Barsian Mosque, also in Persia, in 1098; these, like 7-point geometrical patterns, are rarely used outside Persia and central Asia. Finally, marking the end of the middle stage, 8- and 12-point girih rosette patterns appear in the Al√¢eddin Mosque at Konya, Turkey in 1220, and in the Abbasid palace in Baghdad in 1230, going on to become widespread across the Islamic world.  Late stage  Late stage: geometric, vegetal, and calligraphic patterns around the Mihrab at the alt=Elaborate late stage Islamic woodwork The beginning of the late stage is marked by the use of simple 16-point patterns at the Hasan Sadaqah mausoleum in Cairo in 1321, and in the Alhambra in Spain in 1338‚Äì1390. These patterns are rarely found outside these two regions. More elaborate combined 16-point geometrical patterns are found in the Sultan Hasan complex in Cairo in 1363, but rarely elsewhere. Finally, 14-point patterns appear in the Jama Masjid at Fatehpur Sikri in India in 1571‚Äì1596, but in few other places.  Artforms  Several artforms in different parts of the Islamic world make use of geometric patterns. These include ceramics, girih strapwork, jali pierced stone screens, kilim rugs, leather, metalwork, muqarnas vaulting, shakaba stained glass, woodwork, and zellige tiling.  Ceramics  Ceramics lend themselves to circular motifs, whether radial or tangential. Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower petals, while circular bands can run around a bowl or jug. Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the Ayyubid period, 13th century. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 petals lend themselves to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited to the shape of the vessel they were making. Thus an unglazed earthenware water flask from Aleppo in the shape of a vertical circle (with handles and neck above) is decorated with a ring of moulded braiding around an Arabic inscription with a small 8-petalled flower at the centre.  Girih tilings and woodwork  Girih are elaborate interlacing patterns formed of five standardized shapes. The style is used in Persian Islamic architecture and also in decorative woodwork. Girih designs are traditionally made in different media including cut brickwork, stucco, and mosaic faience tilework. In woodwork, especially in the Safavid period, it could be applied either as lattice frames, left plain or inset with panels such as of coloured glass; or as mosaic panels used to decorate walls and ceilings, whether sacred or secular. In architecture, girih forms decorative interlaced strapwork surfaces from the 15th century to the 20th century. Most designs are based on a partially hidden geometric grid which provides a regular array of points; this is made into a pattern using 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotational symmetries which can fill the plane. The visible pattern superimposed on the grid is also geometric, with 6-, 8-, 10- and 12-pointed stars and a variety of convex polygons, joined by straps which typically seem to weave over and under each other. The visible pattern does not coincide with the underlying construction lines of the tiling. The visible patterns and the underlying tiling represent a bridge linking the invisible to the visible, analogous to the \\"epistemological quest\\" in Islamic culture, the search for the nature of knowledge.  Jali  Mosque of Ibn Tulun: window with girih- style 10-point stars (at rear), with floral roundels in hexagons forming a frieze at front Jali are pierced stone screens with regularly repeating patterns. They are characteristic of Indo-Islamic architecture, for example in the Mughal dynasty buildings at Fatehpur Sikri and the Taj Mahal. The geometric designs combine polygons such as octagons and pentagons with other shapes such as 5- and 8-pointed stars. The patterns emphasized symmetries and suggested infinity by repetition. Jali functioned as windows or room dividers, providing privacy but allowing in air and light. Jali forms a prominent element of the architecture of India. The use of perforated walls has declined with modern building standards and the need for security. Modern, simplified jali walls, for example made with pre-moulded clay or cement blocks, have been popularised by the architect Laurie Baker. Pierced windows in girih style are sometimes found elsewhere in the Islamic world, such as in windows of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo.  Kilim  geometric motifs such as the Wolf's Mouth (Kurt A«ßzi), to protect the flocks against wolves, are often woven into tribal kilims. A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), whether for household use or a prayer mat. The pattern is made by winding the weft threads back over the warp threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt A«ßzi, Kurt ƒ∞zi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.  Leather  Islamic leather is often embossed with patterns similar to those already described. Leather book covers, starting with the Quran where figurative artwork was excluded, were decorated with a combination of kufic script, medallions and geometric patterns, typically bordered by geometric braiding.  Metalwork  Metal artefacts share the same geometric designs that are used in other forms of Islamic art. However, in the view of Hamilton Gibb, the emphasis differs: geometric patterns tend to be used for borders, and if they are in the main decorative area they are most often used in combination with other motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal motifs, or calligraphic script. Geometric designs in Islamic metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other motifs, or they can form the background pattern. Even where metal objects such as bowls and dishes do not seem to have geometric decoration, still the designs, such as arabesques, are often set in octagonal compartments or arranged in concentric bands around the object. Both closed designs (which do not repeat) and open or repetitive patterns are used. Patterns such as interlaced six-pointed stars were especially popular from the 12th century. Eva Baer notes that while this design was essentially simple, it was elaborated by metalworkers into intricate patterns interlaced with arabesques, sometimes organised around further basic Islamic patterns, such as the hexagonal pattern of six overlapping circles.  Muqarnas  Muqarnas are elaborately carved ceilings to semi-domes, often used in mosques. They are typically made of stucco (and thus do not have a structural function), but can also be of wood, brick, and stone. They are characteristic of Islamic architecture of the Middle Ages from Spain and Morocco in the west to Persia in the east. Architecturally they form multiple tiers of squinches, diminishing in size as they rise. They are often elaborately decorated.  Stained glass  Geometrically patterned stained glass is used in a variety of settings in Islamic architecture. It is found in the surviving summer residence of the Palace of Shaki Khans, Azerbaijan, constructed in 1797. Patterns in the \\"shabaka\\" windows include 6-, 8-, and 12-point stars. These wood-framed decorative windows are distinctive features of the palace's architecture. Shabaka are still constructed the traditional way in Sheki in the 21st century. Traditions of stained glass set in wooden frames (not lead as in Europe) survive in workshops in Iran as well as Azerbaijan. Glazed windows set in stucco arranged in girih-like patterns are found both in Turkey and the Arab lands; a late example, without the traditional balance of design elements, was made in Tunisia for the International Colonial Exhibition in Amsterdam in 1883. The old city of Sana'a in Yemen has stained glass windows in its tall buildings. Zellige Zellige (, zeliij) is geometric tilework with glazed terracotta tiles set into plaster, forming colourful mosaic patterns including regular and semiregular tessellations. The tradition is characteristic of Morocco, but is also found in Moorish Spain. Zellige is used to decorate mosques, public buildings and wealthy private houses.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has among other relevant holdings 124 mediaeval (1000‚Äì1400 A.D.) objects bearing Islamic geometric patterns, including a pair of Egyptian minbar (pulpit) doors almost 2 m. high in rosewood and mulberry inlaid with ivory and ebony; and an entire mihrab (prayer niche) from Isfahan, decorated with polychrome mosaic, and weighing over 2,000 kg. Wooden box inlaid with ivory with zellige-like geometrical motifs. Italy (Florence or Venice) 15th century. Islamic decoration and craftsmanship had a significant influence on Western art when Venetian merchants brought goods of many types back to Italy from the 14th century onwards. The Dutch artist M. C. Escher was inspired by the Alhambra's intricate decorative designs to study the mathematics of tessellation, transforming his style and influencing the rest of his artistic career. In his own words it was \\"the richest source of inspiration I have ever tapped.\\" which cites Cultural organisations such as the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and the Institute for Advanced Study run events on geometric patterns and related aspects of Islamic art. In 2013 the Istanbul Center of Design and the Ensar Foundation ran what they claimed was the first ever symposium of Islamic Arts and Geometric Patterns, in Istanbul. The panel included the experts on Islamic geometric pattern Carol Bier, Jay Bonner, Eric Broug, Hacali Necefoƒülu and Reza Sarhangi. In Britain, The Prince's School of Traditional Arts runs a range of courses in Islamic art including geometry, calligraphy, and arabesque (vegetal forms), tile-making, and plaster carving. Seljuk princes at Kharaghan, Qazvin province, Iran, covered with many different brick patterns like those that inspired Ahmad Rafsanjani to create auxetic materials Computer graphics and computer-aided manufacturing make it possible to design and produce Islamic geometric patterns effectively and economically. Craig S. Kaplan explains and illustrates in his Ph.D. thesis how Islamic star patterns can be generated algorithmically. Two physicists, Peter J. Lu and Paul Steinhardt, attracted controversy in 2007 by claiming that girih designs such as that used on the Darb-e Imam shrine in Isfahan were able to create quasi-periodic tilings resembling those discovered by Roger Penrose in 1973. They showed that rather than the traditional ruler and compass construction, it was possible to create girih designs using a set of five \\"girih tiles\\", all equilateral polygons, secondarily decorated with lines (for the strapwork). In 2016, Ahmad Rafsanjani described the use of Islamic geometric patterns from tomb towers in Iran to create auxetic materials from perforated rubber sheets. These are stable in either a contracted or an expanded state, and can switch between the two, which might be useful for surgical stents or for spacecraft components. When a conventional material is stretched along one axis, it contracts along other axes (at right angles to the stretch). But auxetic materials expand at right angles to the pull. The internal structure that enables this unusual behaviour is inspired by two of the 70 Islamic patterns that Rafsanjani noted on the tomb towers.

Company Information S1 is one of the many affiliated companies in the giant Hokuto Corporation group. Hokuto distributes the studio's videos via retail sales and online through its DMM website. The Public Relations representative for the studio is Megumi Yamane (Â±±Ê†πÊÑõÁæé). The studio's website, s1s1s1.com, has been online since June 30, 2004 and their first videos were released in November 2004 starring AV Idols Sora Aoi and Alice Ogura along with the simultaneous debut of eight new actresses: MEW, Mami Hayasaki, Kaya Yonekura, Chihiro Hara, Kanan Kawai, Akane Mochida, Rin Hino and Misato Shiraishi. All Japanese adult videos are censored by applying a mosaic over the genital areas but in late 2004, S1 was the first company to replace the old analog mosaics with a new thinner digital mosaic they named . In celebration of its 5th anniversary, S1 organized a special puroresu event with All Japan Pro Wrestling, which was held on January 22, 2010 at Korakuen Hall. The main bout of the event, named the Akiho Yoshizawa Cup after the popular idol of the studio, featured several prominent wrestlers such as Keiji Mutoh, Masakatsu Funaki, TARU, and Ryota Hama. S1 began producing videos in Blu-ray format as early as September 2009 with The Raped Female Teacher 2 starring Akiho Yoshizawa. By late 2011, the S1 catalog of Blu-ray releases numbered 53 videos. S1 became the first Japanese AV studio to produce works in 3D format in June 2010. The first, 3D x Mika Kayama, starring Mika Kayama, was released on June 7 and the second, 3D x Yuma Asami, starring Yuma Asami, came out on June 19. Shooting in 3D was a new experience for the studio and required actors to move more slowly and new lighting arrangements. Production took three months, about three times longer than the usual AV. The release of the 3D videos coincided with the introduction of 3D televisions by Sony and Panasonic and the titles were expected to boost sales of the new TVs. S1 and other AV studios were also looking for a way to increase lagging sales and intended to produce several more 3D titles for 2010. Videos and codes S1 released its first 11 videos on November 11, 2004 labeled with the production codes ONED-001 to ONED-011. The company continued using the ONED series of production codes, releasing as many as 30-40 videos per month, until ONED-999 appeared on June 19, 2008 when it switched to a new code series starting with SOE-001. Compilation videos which re-mix previously released material use production codes of the type starting with ONSD-001. In addition, S1 videos intended \\"for rental only\\" carry different codes. Original videos are labeled 5ONE-xxx or 5SOE-xxx and compilation videos follow the scheme 5ONS-xxx, where the \\"xxx\\" portion corresponds to the 3 digits of the same \\"for sale\\" videos. Popularity and awards In the 2006 and 2007 AV Open contests based on video sales, the S1 entry took the First Place Award in both years. The S1 nominated video in the 2008 AV Grand Prix (based on sales and fan votes), won the GrandPrix Stage Highest Award and also the award for Best Package Design as well as the Press Award and the Dealer Award. At the 2007 Vegas Night awards, the S1 video Hyper-Risky Mosaic Mihiro won for Best Title and the top 4 places in the Best Actress category were taken by S1 actresses with Akiho Yoshizawa taking 1st Place. The studio also dominated the 2009 AV GrandPrix Awards winning the top GrandPrix Award in addition to taking the DVD Sales Award, the Retailers Award, Best Package Design Award, and the Best Featured Actress Video Award for Double Risky Mosaic, Rio & Yuma.

It was released on March 24, 2009.  Background  According to Deacon: \\"Spiderman of the Rings was very carefree and youthful ‚Äì sort of partying for the sake of partying. This record is less about a party and more about a celebration.\\" In an interview broadcast on NPR's Talk of the Nation on April 22, 2009, Deacon stated that the word 'Bromst' had no meaning other than being the title of the album. In an interview with The A.V. Club, Deacon discusses the composition and lyrical content of the album: \\"The music itself is very much about cycles, time, and what happens after life, becoming a ghost and stuff like that‚Ä¶ The lyrical content is about the future. I think there is going to be a large paradigm shift in a few years, and it could either be to a new age of enlightenment and unity... or it could be a return to a dark age of kings and mass, open oppression followed by a die-off of human culture.\\"  Recording process  While many of the sounds in Bromst are computer generated, much of it was recorded using live instruments. The album was produced by Chester Gwazda and tracked mainly in Baltimore and was mixed at SnowGhost Studio in Whitefish, Montana. For a few of the tracks on Bromst, Deacon uses a player piano. The piano had to be re-wired so that each line was tracked individually, so the piano could keep up with what Deacon composed, which engineer Brett Allen claims to be impossibly fast to play on one piano. Live On December 11, 2008, Deacon performed many of the songs from Bromst with an ensemble of live performers at the Masonic Temple in Brooklyn, New York. The lineup of the ensemble was: Percussion: * Eric Beach (So Percussion) * Denny Bowen (Double Dagger, Roomrunner, Smart Growth) * Jeremy Hyman (Ponytail, Ultimate Reality) * Kevin O'Meara (Videohippos, Ultimate Reality) * Rich O'Meara (ko'mm) * Josh Quillen (So Percussion) * Adam Sliwinski (So Percussion) * Jason Treuting (So Percussion) * Max Eilbacher (Needle Gun, Teeth Mountain) Synthesizers, keyboards, and electronics: * Benny Boeldt (Adventure) * William Cashion (Future Islands) * Dan Deacon * Chester Gwazda (Nuclear Power Pants) * Gerrit Welmers (Future Islands) Guitars: * Matt Papiach (Ecstatic Sunshine, White Williams) * Ken Seeno (Ponytail) Deacon embarked on a North American tour in the spring of 2009 where he performed with a 14-piece band, similar to the one above.

Leisurecorp also has major shareholdings in Island Global Yachting, Troon Golf, GPS Industries, and Snowmass, Colorado. History In November 2007, Leisurecorp agreed a major partnership deal with the PGA European Tour. The highlight of the deal saw the creation of the season ending Dubai World Championship, held annually on the Earth Course at Jumeirah Golf Estates. The US$10 million prize fund makes it the world‚Äôs richest golf tournament. In addition, the European Tour Order of Merit was rebranded as the Race to Dubai, with an additional US$10 million bonus fund, and the top 60 players qualifying for the season finale. The PGA European Tour‚Äôs International Headquarters were also moved to Jumeirah Golf Estates in 2009, and from the 2010 season, the European Tour schedule will open and close at Leisurecorp venues, starting with the South African Open at Pearl Valley and finishing with the Dubai World Championship. There are also plans for the European Open, a regular tour event, to be moved and make Turnberry its permanent home, although there are reports that this could affect the venues place on the Open Championship rota.

Feline cystitis means \\"inflammation of the bladder in cats\\". The term idiopathic means unknown cause, meaning the direct cause of feline cystitis is unknown; however, certain behaviours have been known to aggravate the illness once it has been initiated. It can affect both males and females of any breed of cat. It is more commonly found in female cats; however, when males do exhibit cystitis, it is usually more dangerous.Cannon, Martha. \\"Feline Medicine a practical guide for veterinary nurses and technicians\\". Feline Medicine Elsevier Sciences Despite the shared terminology, cases of feline idiopathic cystitis, as opposed to human cystitis episodes, are sterile. In other words they do not involve a primary bacterial infection. If the inflammation of the feline bladder is due to an infection, it is no longer considered idiopathic (as a cause has been identified) and it is classed as a feline urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs in cats under the age of 10 years old are very rarely encountered and whilst other specific reasons for the inflammation may be identified, in most cases it will not have an known cause and remains idiopathic.https://www.purina.co.uk/cats/health- and-nutrition/symptoms-to-watch-out-for/urinary-tract-health In cats over 10 years of age, UTIs are much more common and idiopathic cases are much less frequently observed. On the other hand, FIC does show several similarities to an analogous disease in humans called bladder pain syndrome. Signs and symptoms Feline idiopathic cystitis begins as an acute non-obstructive episode and in most cases is self-limiting, resolving itself in around a week. In a smaller number of cases, it can escalate into an obstructive episode which can be life-threatening for a male cat. Non-obstructive FIC In the case of non-obstructive FIC, the underlying inflammatory process has begun but the disease has not progressed to the extent that it prevents urination (ie there is no obstruction of the urethra). The cat‚Äôs lower urinary tract is inflamed and the urethral passage may have narrowed due to swelling but it remains open and he can urinate, albeit in discomfort. Clinical signs apparent during an acute episode include: * Frequent trips to the litter box coupled with straining as a result of an urge to void urinary waste which is irritating the inflamed bladder wall. * Small volumes of urine usually produced. * Sensation of incomplete voiding even once bladder is emptied. * Blood may be present in the urineSands, David. \\"Cats 500 questions answered\\" Cat Questions Barnes and Noble due to glomerulation or possibly Hunner's ulcers. * Odorous urine could be exhibited. * Irritability in personality. * Lack of interest in normal activities. * Hiding in a dark, quiet location (hiding is part of the cat's stress coping mechanism). * Experiencing pain or vocalising when urinating. This may result in the cat avoiding urination due to the pain of excretion which in turn could lead to urine remaining stagnant and concentrated, further irritating the inflamed bladder wall and promoting bladder distension. Concentrated urine also encourages ¬ß crystal formation, aggravating the risk of ¬ß mechanical obstruction (see below). Note that since cats are adept at hiding their pain, vocalising, crying or any other audible cue may not always be observed. * Loss of appetite and/or refusal to drink due to pain. * Adopting unusual postures to cope with the pain. * Urinating in places other than the litter box as the cat associates the pain of urination with the litter box. * Licking/over-grooming in the genital area. * Lying on cold surfaces, such as tile floors or in showers (the cold surfaces help ease pain). Obstructive FIC (‚Äúthe blocked cat‚Äù) If the acute flare-up of non- obstructive FIC has not resolved itself, it can progress to an obstructive episode, where the male urethra can become partially or fully blocked (female cats with their larger urethra do not as a rule block in this way). The following clinical signs can then be seen in addition to many of those listed above: * In the case of full obstruction, unproductive and painful straining with either no urine passed at all or a just few drops produced (\\"spotting\\"), despite frequent trips to the litter box. * Urinary retention due to incomplete voiding as a result of the obstruction which causes bladder distension (the bladder will feel large and tense). * In the case of partial obstruction, involuntary leaking of urine due to overflow incontinence. In the case of full obstruction, paradoxical incontinence may be observed when drops of urine leak past the obstruction due to pressure building up in the distended bladder. * Increased pain caused by a) stagnant urine collecting in the bladder and aggravating underlying inflammation and b) the increasing distension of the bladder. * Increased agitation and restlessness. * Possible vomiting. * Eventual lethargy and listlessness if a fully obstructive episode progresses unchecked and causes risk to life. A full obstruction is a medical emergency and must be relieved by a vet immediately. Partial obstructions should also be investigated as soon as possible as they are unlikely to resolve themselves and will most likely escalate to full obstruction. Early interventions lead to better prognoses. Differential diagnosis of obstructive and non-obstructive cases Symptoms can be confusing as similar clinical signs appear in both obstructive and non-obstructive cases which is problematic as the former is an emergency and the latter is not. For example, a cat suffering from any type of cystitis episode will strain to pass urine and can appear restless. Whilst straining does not necessarily mean a cat is \\"blocked\\", in a small number of serious cases it does. Usually in a non- obstructive case, small amounts of urine will still be passed but where there is an obstruction, no urine at all (or isolated \\"spots\\") will be produced, despite frequent visits to the litter box. However where a cat's urination pattern can not be observed accurately (for example he voids outside or uses non-clumping litter), the position will not be clear. A vet will therefore distinguish between obstructive and non-obstructive cases by checking first if the bladder is distended (ie full of urine) and then palpating it to see if it empties without difficulty. If the bladder cannot be manually expressed (ie emptied) easily to produce a free-flowing, continuous stream of urine, a potential obstruction will be suspected and further diagnostics (urinalysis, ultrasound and x-rays) will usually be undertaken as part of the clinical investigation. Pathophysiology Feline idiopathic cystitis is above all an inflammatory process. Whilst the specific cause is unknown, it appears to be associated with complex interactions among the nervous system, adrenal glands, and urinary bladder. Environment also appears to play a role in the pathophysiology and, in some cases, is associated with clinical signs related to the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, integumentary, and immune systems. Non-obstructive episodes of FIC All flare-ups of FIC begin as non-obstructive incidents involving acute inflammation of the lower urinary tract but where the cat is still able to urinate. The majority of cases remain non-obstructive without escalation into blockage and usually resolve themselves within 7 days with or without treatment.  Causes  The direct cause of feline idiopathic cystitis is unknown. It is a diagnosis of exclusion which means other possible urinary diseases which could cause bladder inflammation (eg feline urinary tract infections or urolithiasis) are ruled out. Research is still being pursued for the causes of cystitis in cats; however, they have found many correlations. Cats who are neutered or spayed too early have experienced a higher incidence of feline cystitis. Age is also a risk factor with younger/middle-aged cats (ie those less than 10 years old) more likely to be pre-disposed to the illness. Cats fed a dry food diet are also at risk due to the lower levels of hydration in those felines compared to those eating wet food (this comparison takes into account moisture from all sources ie food intake and drinking water). Factors that may be associated with an increased likelihood of developing feline cystitis include: *Increased body weight *Stress from house moving or other changes of routine *Stress from having conflicts with other cats or other pets *Stress from boredom or inactivity *Being kept strictly indoors Treatment of an acute episode First and foremost, the cat must be kept well hydrated with wet food/soups/broth/increased water intake. This keeps the urine dilute, reducing pain and inflammation, as well as encouraging urination to keep the bladder clear of debris thereby reducing the risk of a ¬ß mechanical blockage (dry food must therefore be avoided). Since the underlying process is inflammation of the bladder, one of the most frequent pharmacological treatments is to administer anti-inflammatory medication. NSAIDs such as meloxicam or robenacoxib are commonly prescribed to control this (provided there are no renal or gastric contraindications). The condition is intensely painful and analgesia is essential to reduce discomfort and control further stress (which could in turn trigger further inflammation). In the case of a male cat, spasmolytics such as prazosin in combination with dantrolene may also be prescribed to control painful urethral spasms and prevent the risk of a ¬ß functional blockage. As the condition is thought to be stress related, calming supplements such as tryptophan or alpha-casozepine are often added to food. Oral supplements to reinstate the protective glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer of the bladder (often deficient in cats suffering from FIC) may also be considered. The veterinarian may also use a urine sample from the cat to carry out urinalysis to test for the ¬ß presence of crystals which could aggravate the condition (see below).Pawprints and Purr Incorporated. \\"Feline Cystitis\\". Feline Cystitis Within a week most cats should improve spontaneously as the inflammation subsides. However, it is essential to monitor urine output (and compare it to moisture intake) throughout the day, every day, to watch for incipient signs of blocking until the inflammation subsides and the cat returns to good health.  Obstructive episodes of FIC   Causes  Obstructive episodes occur in the rarer instances when the initial, ¬ß non- obstructive attack (see above) is not self-limiting and escalates into partial or full block of the urethra so that voiding of urine is impeded or altogether impossible. Obstruction occurs almost exclusively in male cats due to their long, narrow urethra. There are two reasons why a cat may obstruct (\\"block\\"): = Functional blockage = The block can be functional which occurs when a severe muscle spasm of the urethra occurs to close it shut and the cat is unable to relax himself again to regain normal function. It is intensely painful and is triggered by the underlying inflammation, itself suspected to be caused by the stress of the condition. Effectively the cat involuntarily \\"blocks himself\\". = Mechanical blockage = A mechanical block occurs when actual physical particles obstruct the urethra. A urethral plug forms from bladder \\"sediment\\" (or \\"debris\\") which is composed of material generated from the underlying bladder inflammation (ie red blood cells, white blood cells, mucus from the bladder lining, protein) which instead of being excreted naturally, collect to form a soft toothpaste-like material called \\"matrix\\" which blocks the urethra. Matrix on its own can form a urethral plug (in which case it is called a \\"mucus plug\\") but if ¬ß crystals are present in the bladder (see below), they can coalesce with soft matrix to form a hardened urethral plug. The most common type of urethral plug (over 80%) are of this latter type ie struvite-crystalline plugs. = Interaction between functional and mechanical blockage in FIC = Both functional and mechanical blocks can negatively interact to fully obstruct the cat rapidly. In a multifactorial example, the underlying inflammation can narrow the urethral opening as well as provoking spasming to cause the walls of the urethra to close shut around a urethral plug forming in it. = The role of crystals in obstructive FIC = Crystalluria is the presence of microscopic crystals in feline urine. These are most often struvite precipitates but other minerals such as calcium oxalate crystals are also found, albeit less frequently. Urinary crystals are not necessarily an abnormal finding and can be seen both in cats who are healthy and those who are suffering from a urinary tract illness. Provided they are processed efficiently by the feline urinary system, they are unremarkable. As struvite crystals tend to form in concentrated, alkaline urine, they are unlikely to accumulate to a problematic degree in the healthy, well hydrated cat which is fed a high quality meat or fish diet. This is because: * the high moisture intake will keep urine dilute, causing crystals to dissolve, as well encouraging frequent urination to keep the bladder clear of any crystalline build-up and; * a high quality animal protein diet should of itself naturally keep the urine mildly acidic (ideally a pH of around 6.5) which again encourages struvite dissolution (note that if excessive acidity develops for any reason, it could lead to formation of calcium oxalate crystals). In cases of FIC however, the affected cat is not healthy. He is unwell and his urinary system is not functioning properly, and therefore he may struggle to clear crystals from the bladder as a result of the syndrome. The inflammation, particularly in a full or partial obstructive episode, may encourage urinary retention and incomplete voiding. This causes the urine to continually collect in the bladder and become concentrated (as it becomes stagnant) and concentrated urine encourages crystal formation. Lack of hydration and a dry food diet exacerbates this process. Large amounts of struvite crystals can also aggravate the discomfort of an FIC attack. Due to their sharp edges, they can chafe an already inflamed bladder lining causing more pain and increased bleeding. And whilst crystals (as opposed to uroliths) do not alone cause a urethral obstruction, they aggravate the risk of it since they are usually one of the components of a urethral plug which is responsible for ¬ß mechanical blockage in obstructive episodes (see above). The nature and extent of crystal formation, together with urine pH, can be ascertained with a urinalysis to determine if the there any areas of possible concern.  Treatment of an acute episode  Veterinary attention is essential if urine does not pass at all as the bladder could rupture and there is risk of death within 72 hours. The vet will usually attempt to relieve the blockage with a catheter, to drain the backed-up urine and flush the bladder out of any sediment and/or crystals. This is an invasive, delicate procedure which will require either heavy sedation or general anaesthetic. The cat may then be hospitalised with the catheter in place and hydration administered intravenously to encourage healthy urination and good kidney function for up to 3 days. While the catheter is in place, intravesical instillation (which is also used to treat human interstitial cystitis) may also be administered to repair the compromised bladder lining. When the catheter is removed, the cat must be able to show he can urinate with good function before he can be discharged. With this proviso, he can return home and the anti-inflammatory and anti-spasm medication indicated for non-obstructive cases will be prescribed, as well as oral supplements to calm the cat and replenish the protective bladder lining (see above). Even after the cat is unblocked, the underlying inflammatory syndrome will continue for some days at home (particularly since the catheter itself will have irritated the urethra). Therefore some of the clinical signs for non-obstructive FIC may still be apparent post-discharge until the inflammation subsides and cat has fully recovered (eg frequent voiding, blood in urine, possible leaking due to tenderness). However medication should alleviate the severity and discomfort as well as assisting recovery. The owner must focus above all on good hydration and frequent urination to keep the bladder clear. Wet prescription diets may also be recommended but if the cat refuses this any high quality, high moisture, high animal protein wet food may be administered. A urinary acidifier (eg DL-Methionine or Vitamin C) may be added to the latter to prevent struvite crystal formation but as animal protein is already acidic, it is not strictly necessary. In any case, excessive acidification should be balanced against the risk that it could irritate the inflamed bladder wall (possibly triggering recrudescence ie a further acute attack), as well as encouraging calcium oxalate crystal formation. An acidifier should never be added to prescription urinary food as this has already been acidified. Dry food of any sort (including prescription dry food) must be avoided. Environmental modification to reduce stress, itself suspected to be one of the principal causes of FIC, must also be considered (see below) as the risk of re-blocking is highest within the first week after catheterisation.  Ongoing management of FIC   Importance of hydration  Since feline idiopathic cystitis is commonly known to reoccur, ongoing precautions need to be taken to avoid relapse. Prescription diet cat food may be recommended by a veterinarian to reduce the likelihood of struvite crystal formation which if allowed to accumulate in significant quantities can be problematic. However it is not essential in the absence of urolithiasis and the most important preventative measure is to improve moisture intake in the cat. Good hydration is essential for good urinary tract health. It militates against inflammation but in addition the well hydrated cat is unlikely to degenerate into full blockage, as he will produce large amounts of urine which will flush out any bladder sediment and/or crystals before it can accumulate. Crystals in any case are unlikely to form to a problematic degree in the dilute, mildly acidic urine produced by a cat eating a quality wet, animal protein diet. As domestic cats are descended from their desert-inhabiting ancestors, they instinctively seek moisture from their prey. High quality wet food is the most natural way therefore to hydrate a cat. The nutritional profile of such food will include a high meat content, high levels of moisture, minimal fillers and minimal carbohydrate content (since cats cannot digest carbohydrates efficiently, this could cause digestive inflammation, thus stressing an already weakened immune system). A quality wet food diet will be more effective than dry food, even when moisture intake from drinking water is taken into account. Cats at risk of urinary disease must therefore avoid dry food as much as possible.  Environmental modification  Together with hydration, improvements to the cat's environment have been shown to prevent relapses. Reducing stress and encouraging natural feline behaviour (particularly for indoor cats) is essential. Supervised, outdoor visits will encourage sensory stimulation and defeat boredom which could lead to stress. Play with owners, indoor cat-safe plants (eg cat grass or cat thyme) can again replicate a natural environment indoors. Cats move vertically as well as horizontally so cat trees and high- level hiding places encourage natural movement. Safe, quiet sleeping areas (such as an igloo bed) will allow a cat to retreat to safety if anxious. Acoustic startlement (eg loud noises from washing machines, vacuum cleaners, building work) should be minimised, at least in a period of convalescence, to ensure the cat is not frightened by environmental disturbance. Litter tray availability and hygiene is essential. Easy, unfettered access to clean litter boxes (with litter than can identify any unusual urinary behaviour such as clumping litter) is essential if the cat cannot void outside (cats voiding outdoors do not show a high incidence of relapse). Since aggression between other cats or pets is also a major source of stress, facial pheromone treatments or spatial separation between unco-operative pets may need to be considered.

A native of St. Landry Parish in South Louisiana, he maintained his legal office for many years in Opelousas. In his last year in office, Dupr√©, by then an elderly deaf man, spoke out against the Long intra-party challenger, Dudley LeBlanc of Abbeville through the Long newspaper, the Louisiana Progress. Biography Dupr√© was born into an established French-American family, the son of Lucius Jacques Dupr√© (1822‚Äì1869) and the former Caroline Victoire Vanhille (1826‚Äì1896). His great- grandfather, Jacques Dupr√©, was a pioneer of St. Landry Parish who served as a National Republican governor of Louisiana from 1830 to 1831 and in the Louisiana State Senate during the 1830s and 1840s. Gilbert was only ten when his father, Lucius, who was a law graduate of the University of Virginia and a member of the former Confederate Congress, died. There was no money for Gilbert's education; so he was self-educated in the law while he worked first in the office of the St. Landry Parish clerk of court. He was admitted to the bar in 1880 and established his law office in Opelousas. In 1887, Dupr√© was a member of the Louisiana state militia and was on active duty at the time of a riot in Morgan City in St. Mary Parish. He was a member of the Masonic lodge, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, and the Roman Catholic Church. From 1888 to 1992 and again from 1913, to fill the seat vacated by A. H. Garland, who left the state, until 1932, Dupr√© was a Democratic member of the Louisiana House of Representatives. He served as a state district court judge by election from 1896 to 1900 and by appointment in 1914. He was elected judge in 1916, 1920, and 1924, while he also served in the part-time legislative post. Such dual office-holding is no longer permitted. Judge Dupr√©, as he was long known, was a member of the Louisiana Constitutional Convention of 1921. In his second stint in the legislature, his successors included his son-in- law, Felix Octave Pavy, a prominent St. Landry Parish physician and an uncle by marriage of Dr. Carl Weiss, the assassin of U.S. Senator Huey Pierce Long, Jr. The editor of the former New Orleans Item referred to Representative Dupr√©'s steadfast opposition to tax increases: > There was a statesman in Tennessee who attributed his popularity to the fact > that he had never voted for a tax or against an appropriation. We might > almost say of Judge Dupr√© that we do not recall his ever having voted for a > tax increase, salary increase, or for an increased appropriation. The > position of the twelfth man in opposition to eleven stubborn jurors is one > which the judge is not afraid to take in a world which loves to have > unanimous action and where kickers are generally made uncomfortable.Quoted > in Henry E. Chambers, A History of Louisiana, (vol. 2) (Chicago and New York > City: The American Historical Society, Inc., 1925), pp. 378-379 In 1881, Dupr√© married Julia B. Estilette (1860‚Äì1944) of Opelousas, the daughter of his law partner, E. D. Estilette. She was born in New Haven, Connecticut, where her father was attending Yale University. E. D. Estilette was a judge and in 1876 the Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives. The couple had four children, including twin daughters, a son, and a third daughter. He was a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. Dupr√© outlived his wife by two years. They are interred along with other family members at the Myrtle Grove Cemetery in Opelousas. To retaliate against Dupr√©, Long had a hole drilled in the roof directly above Dupre's office in the Old Louisiana State Capitol to punish Dupr√© for the lawmaker's opposition to a new capitol building. When he demanded that Governor Huey Long repair the problem at once, Long said that he would do so only if Dupr√© would vote for the planned new Louisiana State Capitol building, to be built in skyscraper format. When Dupr√© refused to commit his vote, Long told him, \\"Die, damn you, in the faith!\\"Huey Pierce Long, Jr., Every Man a King: The Autobiography of Huey P.

She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 10 February 2009. Goldsmith did not have to audition for the role of Cassandra and was instead chosen by the producers for the role. The actress began filming her first scenes at the end of September 2008. She was initially contracted for six weeks, but this was extended after she impressed the producers with her performance. Goldsmith filmed her final scenes in January 2009 and Cassandra's departure was aired on 29 April 2009. Cassandra is the ex-wife of Matt Freedman (Benjamin Mitchell) and mother of Donna (Margot Robbie), Tegan (Chelsea Jones) and Simon Freedman (Mauricio Merino, Jr.). Goldsmith described Cassandra as a troublemaker, a femme fatale and insanely selfish, while Digital Spy's Darren Rowe called her \\"seductive and troublesome\\". Rather than being their parent, Cassandra acts like a jealous sister towards her children and Goldsmith revealed that she is not a maternal person. She had Donna when she was young and often resented her, while Tegan was her partner in crime. Cassandra moves to Ramsay Street to find herself a wealthy man and sets her sights on Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). Casting On 7 September 2008, Fiona Byrne from the Herald Sun revealed that Goldsmith had been cast as Cassandra Freedman, mother of Donna Freedman played by Margot Robbie. The actress stated \\"I have been cast as a bit of a yummy mummy, which is great because I am 46 and I am a mother and I love that I am getting a meaty role instead of being cast as a plain old boring mum.\\" Goldsmith did not have to audition for the role, instead she was specifically chosen for it by the Neighbours producers'. She explained \\"They actually offered me the role - it was not an audition situation. It was lovely to be asked and that they think I can nail this character.\\" Goldsmith was initially contracted to the show for six weeks and she began filming her first scenes at the end of the month. She made her first screen appearance as Cassandra on 10 February 2009. In November, Byrne announced that the Neighbours producers had been so impressed with Goldsmith's performance as Cassandra, that they extended her contract with the show by a further six weeks. Goldsmith commented that she was \\"so happy\\" to be working on Neighbours. The actress completed filming on her three-month stint in January 2009. Goldsmith told Byrne's colleague, Luke Dennehy, that working on the serial had helped distract her from the breakdown of a relationship. She also stated that she had had \\"the time of her life\\", never guessing that she would have loved it so much. Goldsmith made her final appearance as Cassandra on 29 April 2009. Development Characterisation Shortly before making her first screen appearance, Goldsmith revealed that she accepted the role of Cassandra because she thought \\"the character sounded really quirky and out-there and it seemed like lots of fun.\\" The actress called Cassandra \\"pretty fun\\" and \\"a risk taker\\". She thought she might be classified as a troublemaker and a femme fatale, before revealing that there would be some comedy in the role too. Darren Rowe from Digital Spy described Cassandra as \\"seductive and troublesome\\", while a writer for Yahoo!7 called her a cougar. Goldsmith later branded her character \\"a real piece of work\\", before adding \\"Cassandra's a vixen, she's manipulative, she's vulnerable. She only sees the world through her eyes, and what she can get from every situation. She's insanely selfish... but so much fun!\\" A Sunday Mercury reporter thought Cassandra was \\"glamorous\\" and \\"not exactly a woman in need\\". Goldsmith said that Cassandra's flair for the dramatic earned her a mixed response from the neighbours, who she found to be boring. The actress added that Cassandra was ready to \\"spice things up\\" around the place. When asked by a TV Week columnist if Cassandra had \\"a fabulous and rather naughty wardrobe\\", Goldsmith replied that while it is not really naughty, Cassandra does tend to dress like she would have done when she was in her twenties. She often wears a lot of revealing outfits, which do not \\"leave a lot of room for loose change.\\" Family Margot Robbie portrayed Cassandra's daughter, Donna. Cassandra is the mother of Donna, Tegan (Chelsea Jones) and Simon Freedman (Mauricio Merino, Jr.). When she arrived in Ramsay Street she was going through a \\"nightmare divorce\\" with Matt Freedman (Benjamin Mitchell). A Holy Soap writer stated that Cassandra acted like \\"a jealous big sister\\" towards her children, rather than being their parent. Goldsmith elaborated on this further during an interview with Inside Soap's Jason Herbison, saying that \\"Sass isn't a maternal person and has never been able to connect with her kids\\". She explained that Cassandra was very young when she had Donna and did not have the maturity to deal with motherhood. She often resented Donna and eventually saw her as a threat. Over the years, Cassandra has hurt Donna so much that her daughter has \\"almost become immune\\" to her mother's behaviour. Goldsmith noted that Tegan, Cassandra's youngest daughter, is her partner in crime. Paul Robinson Goldsmith explained to Herbison that Cassandra chose to move to Ramsay Street after learning that there was a Salvation Army house for families in need available. She believed that her family fit the bill. However, the real reason she came to town was to find herself a man and she set her sights on wealthy resident, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). Cassandra used her \\"feminine wiles\\" to make him fall for her. When Paul's former girlfriend, Rebecca Napier (Jane Hall), played an April Fool's Day prank on her, Cassandra vowed revenge and framed her rival for selling alcohol to minors. However, Cassandra underestimated Paul's loyalty to Rebecca and decided to get revenge on him too, by accusing him of stalking her. The neighbours were left unsure as to whether Paul was guilty or not when Cassandra filed a harassment charge with the police. Rebecca defended him and Donna decided to try to find out the truth by moving in with her mother. Cassandra's lie was eventually exposed and she was \\"forced to make a grovelling apology.\\" Storylines Cassandra arrives in Erinsborough and goes to Charlie's bar, where she bumps into Paul Robinson, who mistakes her for a prostitute. Cassandra tells him that she is a receptionist, but that does not mean she has to dress like one. She then heads to Ramsay Street, to move into the Salvation Army owned refuge at Number 24. Cassandra's daughter, Donna, is shocked to see her mother. and begs her not to ruin anything for her, as she has grown fond of the neighbours. Cassandra follows Donna back to her house and runs into Paul again. She allows her daughter to stay where she is, but vows that they will sort their issues out. It is soon revealed that Cassandra had sent her youngest children, Tegan and Simon, ahead to check out the residents of Ramsay Street. When she spots Paul on the street, Cassandra deliberately traps her dress in her car door and then strips to her underwear. She later kisses Paul, who allows himself to be seduced by her. Cassandra tries unsuccessfully to get Paul to give her an advertising sales job at his newspaper, but she finds herself a job at the hospital as a receptionist. Cassandra sees Paul's friend, Samantha Fitzgerald (Simone Buchanan), as a threat and decides to read her hospital file. She learns that Sam has bipolar disorder and decides to confront her, but Sam blurts out that she had no idea that her ex-husband was not the father of her baby. Sam realises her mistake too late and Cassandra uses the information to blackmail her. Cassandra tells Sam to talk to Donna and convince her to give her mother a chance. When Donna has an argument with her boyfriend, Ringo Brown (Sam Clark), Cassandra invites him to stay the night with her. Donna becomes upset with her mother and when she realises that Paul and Sam are on her side, Donna is forced to move in with her family. Cassandra arranges a date with Paul, but she is furious when he stands her up. She argues with Sam and accidentally reveals the truth about her baby to Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner), leaving her without a reason to blackmail her anymore. Cassandra later learns that Simon glued Paul's doors shut to stop him going on the date and potentially breaking her heart. Cassandra gets herself invited to Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine) and Daniel Fitzgerald's (Brett Tucker) wedding, knowing that Paul will be there. She steals the wedding outfits from the dry cleaners and then offers to help make some new dresses. During the reception, Paul's daughter, Elle (Pippa Black), locks Cassandra in a storeroom to give Paul some time with Rebecca Napier. Believing that Paul is slipping away from her, Cassandra calls Rebecca's ex- boyfriend, Andrew Simpson (Peter Flanigan), and tells him how much Rebecca misses him. Andrew and Rebecca get back together, while Cassandra comforts Paul. She begins causing problems for her children, especially Tegan. Cassandra encourages her daughter to shorten her school skirt to attract the boys, but it backfires when Tegan is bullied by Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan). Cassandra is angry when Tegan alters her skirts back, but Tegan stands up to her and reveals that hates dressing like her mother. Cassandra finds Kyle helping Tegan with her chemistry project and starts flirting with him, angering Tegan once more. Cassandra learns that Simon stole an iPod and becomes annoyed that her children are rebelling. When Tegan goes to Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon) for fashion advice, Cassandra insults her and is thrown out by Bridget's mother. Cassandra accidentally purchases a fake scratchcard meant for someone else and believes that she has won $20,000. After Rebecca tells her the truth, Cassandra thinks she is behind the prank and decides to get revenge on her. She asks Tegan to order her an alcoholic drink at the bar, making sure that Rebecca thinks that she will come and collect it. Tegan picks the drink up and Cassandra announces that Rebecca has sold alcohol to a minor, before threatening to call the police. However, not many people believe her and Paul turns against her. Simon and Tegan becomes fed up with their mother and leave to stay with their grandmother. Cassandra seeks revenge on Paul and claims that he has been harassing her. Cassandra begins receiving threatening notes and after a silent phone call, she becomes scared. She later makes a public apology for her actions. Cassandra also tries to be nice to the neighbours and encourages Donna to audition for the school play. But she becomes jealous of her daughter's success and makes sure she ruins her second audition. Cassandra learns that Donna is her stalker and reports her to the police, despite Elle asking her not to. Cassandra tries to make things right with Donna by offering to help make costumes for the play. However, she mocks her daughter during a rehearsal and accuses Daniel of coming on to her when she sees him comforting her. The Ramsay Street residents later decide to get rid of Cassandra. She is fired from her job for being late, barred from Charlie's and Harold's Store by Elle and reported to the Salvation Army for not needing their house. Cassandra realises that she has been defeated and decides to leave, but not before telling Donna that a guy named Nick is actually her father and not the man who raised her. Cassandra then packs her bags and drives out of the street, knocking over everyone's bins as she goes. Reception For her portrayal of Cassandra, Goldsmith was nominated for \\"Best Bitch\\" at the 2009 Inside Soap Awards. John Burfitt from TV Soap named Cassandra one of Neighbours' \\"greatest bitches\\". He stated that she was \\"The meanest mum and toughest tart ever in Ramsay Street\\" and nicknamed her \\"Cyclone Cass.\\" A writer for Holy Soap said Cassandra's most memorable moment was \\"When she accidentally-on-purpose got her dress caught in her car door, allowing her to strip down to her undies.\\" A Daily Record reporter hoped that Cassandra would be run out of town as way of justice for her bad deeds. They added \\"We know you need villains to spice the drama up a bit ‚Äì but she's something else. Cass is manipulative, spiteful and downright nasty. In fact, she gives women a bad name.\\" A writer for the Sunday Mercury thought Cassandra was \\"one of the most annoying characters Ramsay Street has ever seen\\", while a Western Mail reporter called her the \\"mother from hell.\\" A Sunday Mail reporter commented that Cassandra had turned out to be \\"one of the most irritating characters ever to grace Ramsay Street.\\" Tim Elliott, writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, was positive towards the character. He stated that most viewers were trying to avoid suburban reality and wanted melodrama, which \\"resident bitch\\" Cassandra provided. He added \\"When not washing her car in spray-on jeans, Cassandra is delivering bottles of chilled champagne to distressed neighbour Paul. Everyone hates Cassandra, perhaps because she is a single mother (boo!) but also because she is a single mother who is having fun (double boo!). All the other characters - footy jock Ringo, Donna and responsible Rebecca - are way too real and suburban for me.\\" Gordon Farrer from The Age branded Cassandra a \\"yummy mummy.\\" Cassandra came third in an Inside Soap poll to find out which Neighbours character readers would miss most following their departure. Cassandra received 10% of the vote.

Krishna, two leading artists in the field. The film is significant because it is considered to be the first of its kind in the Carnatic music world.  Concept  Margazhi Raagam was conceptualised by Jayendra Panchapakesan a pioneer of the South Indian ad film making industry. The film follows a 'concert' format, with the artistes performing on a stage, but uses video styles to give the audience a multi-directional view of the stage and set. On the official website, Jayendra says: \\"For over four years, I have been living with the idea of giving Carnatic music an evocative new appeal in terms of presentation. Finally, the technology became available to give this dream the right shape. Margazhi Raagam brings together two things that are close to my heart ‚Äì music and cinema! I am sure that classical music and cinema will see the benefit of this initiative, as will artistes and music lovers.\\" Along with him a number of leading technicians have participated in the creation of this film. Some of whom are H. Sridhar - Audiography, P.C. Sreeram - Cinematography, Rajeevan - Art Direction, and Satissh Kurosowa - Editing which has awed South Indian audiences and is set to release in theatres across the globe in the months to follow.  Technology  Margazhi Raagam is significant for the fact that it uses the digital capture quality of the Red One camera and high-quality, uncompressed, six track surround sound to deliver audio clarity and audio mixing finesse that carnatic music audiences have not experienced in a live concert so far. The film is also expected to be released in Blu-ray, DVD and Audio CD formats in the near future.  Experience  The experience offered by this film is the first of its kind. Viewers have mentioned that they were overcome with emotion while watching the film.Viewer comments on the official website  References   External links  * * Margazhi Raagam Review * Business world review of Margazhi Raagam * Screen India review of Margazhi Raagam Category:Carnatic music Category:Indian classical music Category:Indian films ","title":"Margazhi Raagam"},{"id":"21573918","text":"Santa Clara Valley Medical Center (abbreviated SCVMC; locally known as Valley Medical Center, Valley Medical, or simply \\"Valley\\") is a 731-bed tertiary referral hospital in Santa Clara County, California.

The campus and hospital were founded at its present location in 1876 by Dr. Benjamin Cory, the Director of Public Health. Founded as the County Hospital, it was the first organized hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area. The current campus continues to sit at the very same spot where the original hospital was constructed in the 19th century. This has led to issues with construction on site with the February 2012 unearthing of an 1870-1920s pauper's grave site. Trauma and emergency care Santa Clara Valley Medical Center is one of five adult level one trauma centers in Northern California, along with Stanford University Medical Center in northwestern Santa Clara County, San Francisco General Hospital in San Francisco, Highland Hospital (Alameda County) in Oakland, and UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento.

History Fairfield Materials Management was founded in 2003 by a small group of ecological activists, horticulturists and social entrepreneurs.http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about.html Fairfield Materials Management was initiated by Val Rawlinson (Director) after she became involved in an East Manchester anti-incineration campaign in 1996. The incinerator was not built, but Lucy Danger and Val Rawlinson realised that they had to show Manchester that environmental and social alternatives were available and working successfully throughout the United Kingdom and so Fairfield Composting was established by Val who began promoting home composting and supplying compost bins. and Lucy set up EMERGE Recycling recruiting Val as a director. Val also recognised the need for a commercial sized composting system for New Smithfield Market and choose a Vertical Composting Unit (VCU) system as the preferred technology; Emma Smith was recruited as a waste auditor in November 2001 to undertake a waste composition analysis of Smithfield Market's waste. Chris Walsh joined the team and between 2001 and 2003 the group secured several hundred thousand pounds through grants and loans, designed the site, obtaining planning permission and a waste management licence.http://www.communitycompost.org/hotrotters/fmm.htm In 2003 Fairfield began operating and initially diverted waste from four market traders, taking in green waste from Manchester City Council and producing compost. In 2004 a further two composting units were added and in 2005 a final three units were added to the system. This enabled Fairfield to process all of the market's fruit and vegetable waste through the in-situ technology.http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about/history.html Whilst remaining a director of Fairfield Val set up Debdale Eco Centre(DEC) and with Emma's help secured funding to promote home composting. WRAP funding later enabled DEC to run a project supplying low cost compost bins which achieved high home composting levels. When Manchester City Council working in partnership with BIFFA introduced the Green Bin home composting levels were reduced negating the work undertaken by Val. Val retired from DEC aged 70 in 2010 but continues as a Director of Fairfield The business became sustainable through the efforts of Ian Trippier who was recruited as office manager bringing his vast experience of social enterprises and business acumen to the organisation.

It is located approximately north of Barrows and west of Dawson Bay which is the northwest part of Lake Winnipegosis, and east of the Saskatchewan border. In 1901, the Red Deer Lumber Company opened a sawmill on the south shore of the lake, and built a rail spur to connect the mill to the Canadian Northern Railway line to the south. The company also created two settlements to serve the mill: the community of Red Deer Lake was built near the mill on the lakeshore, and the community of Barrows was built at the railway junction. The sawmill closed in 1926. The lake is situated almost entirely in the northwest corner of Manitoba's Census Division No. 19, although its northernmost reaches extend into the southwest corner of Division No. 21. The area is heavily forested, and in the years since the Red Deer Lumber Company's mill closed, the area has hosted a number of other logging companies and smaller sawmills as well. Fishing is common and fisheries in the lake and Dawson Bay process catch from Red Deer Lake. There is also coal exploration in the area as well, targeting the Mannville Formation.http://www.infomine.com/index/properties/RED_DEER_LAKE_COAL.htmlRobert Charles Wallace (1919). Mining and mineral prospects in northern Manitoba. p. 38. Red Deer River The Red Deer River arises in east central Saskatchewan and flows east through Red Deer Lake into Dawson Bay of Lake Winnipegosis. To the north of its basin is that of the Saskatchewan River and to the southwest that of the upper Assiniboine River and to the southeast that of the Swan River (Manitoba-Saskatchewan) Fort Red Deer River Fort Red Deer River or Fort Rivi√®re la Biche was a North West Company trading post on the Red Deer River near the town of Hudson Bay, Saskatchewan. It was founded in 1794 by Hugh McGillis, and its date of closure is uncertain. Losey places it at the mouth of the Etomami River at the town ballpark where there is a provincial marker ( in the Hudson Bay Regional Park).Elizabeth Browne Losey (1999). Let Them be Remembered: The Story of the Fur Trade Forts. p. 211. In 1774, Matthew Cocking described two trading posts on the Red Deer River. The Lower Settlement was located on a flat just upriver of the lake, while the Upper Settlement was located 60 miles upriver of the lake. The Upper Settlement likely became Fort Red Deer River. Ruins from both settlements were found by J.B. Tyrrell in 1889. Alexander Mackenzie considered this fort to be one of the three chief trading posts of the Lake Manitoba district. The trading post sat at the approximate intersection of the Assiniboine tribes to the south, and the Swampy Cree tribes to the north.

New Family Organization is Israel‚Äôs leading family rights advocates and triggered precedents for legal equality for women, common-law, same-sex and interfaith families. Rights promoted by New Family Organization include the right to live in a recognized partnership (marriage or common- law), to have children (through natural conception, adoption or via reproductive technologies), to will and inherit assets, and to dissolve a partnership, without discrimination based on faith, nationality, sexual orientation, or status. Founding New Family Organization was established by Irit Rosenblum, an Israeli advocate and legal innovator. Rosenblum advocates a human right to establish a family regardless of gender, religion, nationality, sexual orientation and legal status. Rosenblum is an outspoken proponent of common-law partnership over legal marriage and for the right to use assisted reproductive technologies.High Court of Justice 2458/01 Rosenblum is a member of the Israeli Bar Association and served as a presiding judge in the police disciplinary court. Through her work with New Family, she has challenged Israeli family law. This included gaining recognition for same-sex families, issuing common-law marriage IDs which are recognized in official government bodies, the Biological Will Initiative, and promoting parenthood through reproductive technologies  Constituency  New Family‚Äôs constituency includes people who are vulnerable to infringements on rights due to family status, such as people who can not legally marry in Israel, immigrants,https://www1.jafi.org.il/papers/2002/april/jpapr10.htm interfaith and bi-national families, common-law couples, single parents, same-sex couples, people whose family status disadvantages them for adoption or for reproductive services, foreign citizens, refugees, religiously ‚Äòforbidden‚Äô unions, people deemed ‚Äòineligible‚Äô for marriage by religious law,http://www.ameinu.net/perspectives/israel.php?articleid=147 children deemed ‚Äòillegitimate‚Äô by religious law, people who do not meet the religious definition of any faith, or meet the definition of two faiths, and more. Rights promoted by New Family include the right to marry, to have children, to access adoption services and reproductive technology, register children and spouses, to bequeath and inherit assets and to dissolve a partnershiphttp://www.buzzle.com/editorials/10-15-2004-60499.asp without discrimination based on faith, origin, nationality, sexual orientation, or status.  Legal Innovations  A central aspect of New Family‚Äôs work is innovating legal solutions that circumvent or mitigate infringements on rights in marriage and divorce by creating civil alternatives to religious authorities who have exclusive jurisdiction over family status in Israel. New Family pioneered contractual marriage and Domestic Partnership Cards,http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1198517290440&pagename;=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull which confer legal status and rights equal to married couples on couples that cannot legally marry or do not wish to marry according to the required orthodox religious rites. Domestic Partnership Cards have been issued to thousands of couples and recognized by government authorities.  Biological Wills  New Family promotes a new legal concept of biological wills which specify whether or not an individuals‚Äô reproductive material may be used after their death, who may use it, how long it may be preserved, how many children may be created with it, and legal status of any resulting children. Biological wills apply property law to biological matter and assume that human reproductive material is property that can be willed and inherited like other assets. Biological wills ensure that a person‚Äôs wishes for a biological legacy are legally binding. New Family founded the world‚Äôs only Biological Will Bank, and is the only known organization drafting and storing biological wills.http://www.newfamily.org.il/rec/190-Biological-Will/ In the landmark 2006 Keivan Cohen case, the parents of a 20-year-old soldier killed in action won the right to use the sperm retrieved after his death for posthumous reproduction after proving in court that it was his explicit wish to father children. The case, which was reported in media from around the world, was unique, both because Cohen had not left his wish in writing, and because the woman that would carry his child was not known to him during lifetime. Since then, court attitude in Israel has been changed to require written consent for posthumous reproduction.  Activities  The New Family Organization runs a family rights information hotline, provides legal consultation and aid, litigates legal precedents in family rights, advocates legislation and policy for equal rights for all families,http://www.newfamily.org.il/cat/9-◊î◊¶◊¢◊ï◊™- ◊ó◊ï◊ß-/ publishes family rights guidebooks,http://www.newfamily.org.il/cat/8-◊û◊ì◊®◊ô◊õ◊ô-◊ñ◊õ◊ï◊ô◊ï◊™-◊ï◊°◊§◊®◊ô◊ù conducts research and data analysis, raises public consciousness of family rights, and more.

He played representative level rugby union (RU) for South Africa, and at provincial level for Western Province as a wing, i.e. number 11 or 14, and representative rugby league (RL) for Rugby League XIII, and at club level for St Helens and Wakefield Trinity (Heritage ‚Ññ 669) as a , i.e. number 2 or 5. Playing career International honours Jan Prinsloo won caps for South Africa (RU) while at Western Province against France on Saturday 26 July 1958, and against France on Saturday 16 August 1958, and represented Rugby League XIII (RL). Club career Jan Prinsloo was signed by St. Helens on 14 October 1958, he scored his first try for St. Helens as part of a two-try d√©but against Rochdale Hornets on Saturday 8 November 1958. During the 1958‚Äì59 season Prinsloo scored hat-tricks against Salford and Blackpool Borough for a season total of 27-tries from 31 games. Prinsloo played a vital part in finishing dazzling moves for many a St. Helens victory including the sensational 1959 Championship Final win by 44 points to 22 over a great Hunslet side where Prinsloo exhibited a fabulous touchline dash rounded off with his trademark 'swallow dive' over the tryline. During the 1959‚Äì60 season Prinsloo scored 4-tries against Liverpool City and a hat-trick of tries against Hull FC, finishing the season with 29-tries from 38 matches. The following year brought more success with a hat-trick of tries against Workington Town, his last match for St. Helens was against Warrington on Saturday 7 January 1961. The transferring of both Prinsloo to Wakefield Trinity and Frank Carlton to Wigan paved the way for a ¬£11,000 World Record transfer to bring Mick Sullivan to Knowsley Road. Prinsloo had the daunting task of wearing the St. Helens number five jersey at the same time as Tom van Vollenhoven was setting the whole game on fire on the other wing. His record and strike-rate demonstrates what a fine finisher Prinsloo was in rugby league. He made his d√©but for Wakefield Trinity during February 1961, and he played his last match for Wakefield Trinity during the 1962‚Äì63 season. County Cup Final appearances Jan Prinsloo played , i.e. number 5, in St. Helens 4-5 defeat by Warrington in the 1959 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1959‚Äì60 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 31 October 1959, and played in the 15-9 victory over Swinton in the 1960 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1960‚Äì61 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 29 October 1960 in front of a crowd of over 31,000.

The essay, inspired by Freeman's experiences in a 1960s women's liberation group,Alice Echols, Ellen Willis, Daring to be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967‚Äì1975, University of Minnesota Press, 67, 1989 , reflected on the experiments of the feminist movement in resisting the idea of leaders and even discarding any structure or division of labor. As Hilary Wainwright wrote in Z Magazine, Freeman described how \\"this apparent lack of structure too often disguised an informal, unacknowledged and unaccountable leadership that was all the more pernicious because its very existence was denied\\". As a solution, Freeman suggests formalizing the existing hierarchies in the group and subjecting them to democratic control. The phrase has been used to describe one problem in organizing (the other being \\"rigidity of structure\\", according to ecofeminist Starhawk).Starhawk, \\"Power and Anarchy\\", The Awakened Woman, August 19, 2004 In 2008 Community Development Journal reviewed the article as a \\"classic text\\" which editors felt had influenced the practice of community development.Rosie Meade, \\"Classic Texts: no. 11, Jo Freeman. The Tyranny of Structurelessness\\" (c. 1972), Community Development Journal, Oxford Unity Press, December 9, 2008. That year a John F. Kennedy School of Government course used the paper in a course on leadership.(PAL-101) \\"Exercising Leadership: Mobilizing Group Resources\\" General Course Information, John F. Kennedy School of Government, Fall 2008.  Publication history  The essay originated as a speech given to the Southern Female Rights Union at a conference in Beulah, Mississippi in May 1970. Freeman has stated that it was transcribed in 1971 for the feminist magazine Notes from the Third Year (whose editors chose not to publish it) and submitted to several women's liberation movement publications, only one of which sought her permission to publish it. Other outlets published it without asking for permission. It was first officially published in the journal The Second Wave in 1972. It was issued in pamphlet form by Agitprop in 1972, and later by the Organisation of Revolutionary Anarchists, Leeds Group, United Kingdom. In 1973 the author published different versions in the Berkeley Journal of Sociology and in Ms. magazine. It was also published in Radical Feminism by Anne Koedt, Ellen Levine, and Anita Rapone.Anne Koedt, Ellen Levine, and Anita Rapone, Radical Feminism, Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Co.. 1975, 282‚Äì288. Later printings included that of the Anarchist Workers' Association (Kingston Group), and in 1984 in a pamphlet called Untying the Knot: Feminism, Anarchism & Organisation jointly published by Dark Star Press and Rebel Press (printed by Aldgate Press).  Criticism  Some anarchists have objected to Freeman's analysis because it also has been applied to some anarchist organizing. Howard J. Ehrlich discussed the negative impact of the article on anarchist organizing in Reinventing Anarchy, Again.Howard J. Ehrlich, Reinventing Anarchy, Again, AK Press, 1996, 178-179 , In 1974 Cathy Levine wrote a rejoinder titled \\"The Tyranny of Tyranny\\" which was initially published in the journal Black Rose. In a review of Freeman's essay for Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed, the anarchist Jason McQuinn inveighed against the essay as an \\"incomprehensibly unreal and illogical stab at sociology by a paranoid schizophrenic\\"] and noted its popularity among leftist and platformist anarchists.

Name The name of the settlement was changed from Tabor to Tabor nad Kne≈æakom in 1955.Spremembe naselij 1948‚Äì95. 1996. Database. Ljubljana: Geografski in≈°titut ZRC SAZU, DZS.

The name originates from the time of Turkish invasions, when it was used as a shelter from Turkish soldiers. At that time, tabor meant 'shelter' and the word silen used to mean 'strong'. There are also some unofficial names, such as ≈†ilentabor nad Zagorjem. Aerial view of St. Martin's Church  History  ≈†ilentabor Castle from the seventeenth century, drawn by Johann Weikhard von Valvasor There are some finds that show there were two hillforts from the Iron Age (around the eighth century BC) along the ridge, which were later used by the Romans: ≈†ilentabor and Gradi≈°ƒçe. The first one was more than 300 m in diameter. In the Middle Ages, a castle was built. One of the only records from that time mentioning ≈†ilentabor Castle was The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola by Johann Weikhard von Valvasor. The castle was finished in 1471 and it was mostly used as a shelter from Turkish soldiers and thieves for people from the both sides of the hill. The castle was then burned down by the rebels around 1635. Then, in 1700, the castle burned down again when it was hit by a lightning and then demolished by the French in Napoleonic wars 100 years later. The end of the castle was also described by Miroslav Vilhar (1818‚Äì1871) in his work Silni Tabor. The village used to have eleven houses, but now it has only seven houses, of which four are inhabited.  Sights  Castle ≈†ilentabor Castle was a 15th-century castle, of which only few ruins are visible today. Archaeological excavations have revealed the remains of a medieval defence structure and yielded numerous artifacts, confirming construction and life within the castle complex from the 15th to 17th centuries, as mentioned in historical sources.Acta Carstologica 34(3), 2005 It had more than fifty granaries. A model of a castle can be found in the Pivka Park of Military History. Church The local church, built south of the settlement, is dedicated to Saint Martin and belongs to the Parish of Zagorje.Koper Diocese list of churches It stands on its own nearby hill called St. Martin at an elevation of 723 m. It has a chancel with Gothic elements and frescoes from 1464, which are in the Istrian-Karst artistic style. During the Baroque period, it was expanded. It can be seen from the outside, but to see the inside visitors have to make prior arrangements with Ivana Lenarƒçiƒç, a local guide. The church is surrounded by a small cemetery. According to some records, there were two vaults; in one lies Bishop Andrej Jakob de Raunach, who lived in a nearby castle. Records also say it was its own parish with a monastery below it. There is still a mass every Sunday after St. Martin's Day (11 November).  Sinkhole pond  According to the story, once a castle cook threw a beehive onto the Turkish soldiers to repel them and save the castle. The people then made the pond to thank the bees.

Life He was the eldest child of the Royalist Bishop of Ely Matthew Wren and Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Cutler of Ipswich, and therefore cousin of Sir Christopher Wren. He was educated at both Peterhouse, Cambridge and the University of Oxford, graduating M.A. at Oxford on 9 September 1661. He was secretary to Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, from 1660 to 1667, M.P. for St. Michael (1661 to 1672), and secretary to James, Duke of York (1667 to 1672). He was fatally injured accompanying the duke at the Battle of Solebay in 1672 and died on his return to Greenwich. He was buried with his father at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge. He was one of the council of the Royal Society named in Charles II's original charter, dated 15 July 1662,Thomas Sprat, History of the Royal Society, 1667, p. 55. and was a prominent member of the Society.

It is above sea-level and its surface area is . It is at the northerly base of the Zugspitze ( above sea level and 3.5 km to the south), Germany's highest mountain. The lake lies within the municipality of Grainau and is privately-owned.  Hydrology  The northeast corner of the Eibsee is known as the Untersee. With an area of 4.8 hectares, and 26 meters depth, it is almost completely separated from the main part of the lake, the Weitsee (172 hectares) by a 50-meter-wide and only 0.5-meter-deep narrow point. A hiking trail leads over a small bridge at this narrow point along the north bank of the Eibsee. The deepest point of the entire lake, at 34.5 meters, is only about 90 meters from the southeastern shore (across from the nearby Frillensee). The completely-separated small neighboring lakes include the Frillensee in the south (not to be confused with the larger Frillensee near Inzell), and Braxensee, Steingringpriel, Steinsee, Froschsee, and Drachenseelein in the north.  Geomorphology  Due to its location below the Zugspitze and the clear, green-tinted water, the lake is considered one of the most beautiful lakes in the Bavarian Alps. It was formed when the Isar Loisach glacier withdrew at the end of the W√ºrm glaciation and left a depression that filled with water. Between 1700 BCE and 1400 BCE, a landslide with an area of 13 square kilometers and a volume of 350 million cubic meters crossed the central and eastern part of the lake. The estimated energy released during this landslide event with an average fall height of 1400 meters corresponds to approximately 2.9 megatons of TNT (approximately 220 Hiroshima bombs). This resulted in a major modification of the morphological shape of the Eibsee valley. The shape of today's lake with its 29 hollows and 8 islands was created. It is one of the rare cases in which islands and shallows of a lake are geologically much younger than the lake basin itself. [http://www.umweltgeol- he.de/WerdenfelserGeotope.Wetterstein.Eibseebergsturz. Depiction of the landslide on the Eibsee, website of the environmental geologist Hubert Engelbrecht, accessed on November 25, 2013 Around 8 submarine crests have depths of less than 3 meters. The only noteworthy inflows above ground are the Kotbach, which flows into the northwest tip of the lake, and the Weiterbach in the south. The lake is a 'blind lake', since there is no above-ground drain and water can only drain off or seep away underground, due to the location of the pool. It is believed that the source area of the Kreppbach (locality Rohrlaine), which is located almost 2 km northeast, is fed underground by Eibsee waters.  Name  The name can be traced back to the yew, which used to be found in large numbers around the lake. Today it can only be found sporadically at the lake and only occurs in the protected forest near the lake.  Fishing  During the fishing season from May 1 to October 31, pike, brown trout, rainbow trout, Coregonus, carp, tench and Leuciscinae are mainly fished by amateur anglers.  Transport  There is a good view of the lake from the Zugspitze cable car and from the Bavarian Zugspitze Railway, both of which lead up to the Zugspitze. As of June 2017, trains from Munich to Garmisch-Partenkirchen leave roughly once an hour and the trip takes about an hour and a half.

Landolt, Electrochemical and materials aspects of tribocorrosion systems, J. Physics D: Appl. Phys. 39, 1-7 (2006) The name tribocorrosion expresses the underlying disciplines of tribology and corrosion. Tribology is concerned with the study of friction, lubrication and wear (its name comes from the Greek \\"tribo\\" meaning to rub) and corrosion is concerned with the chemical and electrochemical interactions between a material, normally a metal, and its environment. As a field of research tribocorrosion is relatively new, but tribocorrosion phenomena have been around ever since machines and installations are being used. Tribocorrosion on stainless steel shaft Wear is a mechanical material degradation process occurring on rubbing or impacting surfaces, while corrosion involves chemical or electrochemical reactions of the material. Corrosion may accelerate wear and wear may accelerate corrosion.S. W. Watson, F. J. Friedersdorf, B. W. Madsen, S. D. Cramer, Wear 181-183, (1995) 476-484 One then speaks of corrosion accelerated wear or wear accelerated corrosion. Both these phenomena, as well as fretting corrosion (which results from small amplitude oscillations between contacting surfaces) fall into the broader category of tribocorrosion. Erosion-corrosion is another tribocorrosion phenomenon involving mechanical and chemical effects: impacting particles or fluids erode a solid surface by abrasion, chipping or fatigue while simultaneously the surface corrodes.K. Sasaki, G.T. Burstein, Philosophical Magazine Letters, 80 (2000) 489-493 Phenomena in different engineering fields Tribocorrosion occurs in many engineering fields. It reduces the life-time of pipes, valves and pumps, of waste incinerators, of mining equipment or of medical implants, and it can affect the safety of nuclear reactors or of transport systems. On the other hand, tribocorrosion phenomena can also be applied to good use, for example in the chemical-mechanical planarization of wafers in the electronics industry S. Tagella, A.K. Skder, A. Kumar,J. Electrochem. Soc. 151 (2004) G205 or in metal grinding and cutting in presence of aqueous emulsions. Keeping this in mind, we may define tribocorrosion in a more general way independently of the notion of usefulness or damage or of the particular type of mechanical interaction: Tribocorrosion concerns the irreversible transformation of materials or of their function as a result of simultaneous mechanical and chemical/electrochemical interactions between surfaces in relative motion. Biotribocorrosion Biotribocorrosion covers the science of surface transformations resulting from the interactions of mechanical loading and chemical/electrochemical reactions that occur between elements of a tribological system exposed to biological environments.Y.Yan, Biotribocorrosion ‚Äì an appraisal of the time dependence of wear and corrosion interactions Part II: Surface analysis. Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics. 39(2006) p.3206-3212 It has been studied for artificial joint prostheses. It is important to understand material degradation processes for joint implants to achieve longer service life and better safety issues for such devices. Passive metals While tribocorrosion phenomena may affect many materials, they are most critical for metals, especially the normally corrosion resistant so-called passive metals. The vast majority of corrosion resistant metals and alloys used in engineering (stainless steels, titanium, aluminium etc.) fall into this category. These metals are thermodynamically unstable in the presence of oxygen or water and they derive their corrosion resistance from the presence at the surface of a thin oxide film, called the passive film, which acts as a protective barrier between the metal and its environment.D. Landolt, Corrosion and Surface Chemistry of Metals, EPFL Press, Lausanne, Switzerland, 2007, p. 227-274. Passive films are usually just a few atomic layers thick. Nevertheless, they can provide excellent corrosion protection because if damaged accidentally they spontaneously self-heal by metal oxidation. However, when a metal surface is subjected to severe rubbing or to a stream of impacting particles the passive film damage becomes continuous and extensive. The self-healing process may no longer be effective and in addition it requires a high rate of metal oxidation. In other words, the underlying metal will strongly corrode before the protective passive film is reformed, if at all. In such a case, the total material loss due to tribocorrosion will be much higher than the sum of wear and corrosion one would measure in experiments with the same metal where only wear or only corrosion takes place. The example illustrates the fact that the rate of tribocorrosion is not simply the addition of the rate of wear and the rate of corrosion but it is strongly affected by synergistic and antagonistic effects between mechanical and chemical mechanisms. To study such effects in the laboratory, one most often uses mechanical wear testing rigs which are equipped with an electrochemical cell.S. Mischler, P. Ponthiaux, Wear (journal), 248 (2001) 211-225 This permits one to control independently the mechanical and chemical parameters. For example, by imposing a given potential to the rubbing metal one can simulate the oxidation potential of the environment and in addition, under certain conditions, the current flow is a measure of the instantaneous corrosion rate. Volume loss due to electrochemical dissolution can be measured by Faraday's laws of electrolysis and subtracted from total volume loss in tribocorrosion so the sum of mechanical wear loss and the synergies can be calculated.D. Landolt, S. Mischler, Tribocorrosion of Passive Metals and Coatings, Woodhead, Oxford, 2011 For a deeper understanding tribocorrosion experiments are supplemented by detailed microscopic and analytical studies of the contacting surfaces. At high temperatures, the more rapid generation of oxide due to a combination of temperature and tribological action during sliding wear can generate potentially wear resistant oxide layers known as 'glazes'. Under such circumstances, tribocorrosion can be used potentially in a beneficial way.

W. Spear of Enfield in North London, later supplementary sets like a Farmyard version were introduced. They were designed in the same scale as '0' gauge model railways (1:48 scale). The preference for 'HO' scale railways and the easy to use Lego type plastic toys saw it disappear by the mid-1960s. Its popularity suffered due to its complexity and dated pre-war Metroland style houses. The sets comprised baseboards, terracotta bricks and lintels, plastic door and window frames, card doors and roofing. The bricks were about 1 inch long in scale proportion to regular house bricks. Building plans were accurate architect's blue prints. A limited amount of internal accessories (furniture and fittings), for bathrooms, bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms and even studies (offices), are available in 1:48 scale from some Doll's House accessory suppliers in UK and the USA - though most of these are similar enough to have originated in the same factory. Buildings were constructed on allegedly waterproof waxed card bases. The bricks etc. were stuck together with a mortar made from a mixture of flour and chalk powder. It required a great amount of skill to erect buildings accurately, very time-consuming and beyond the patience of most of the children it was aimed at (8 to 14 years). Especially so in cold houses (as most British homes then were) it would take several days for the building to 'set'. Reusing the components involved a process of dunking the entire model in a large bowl of warm water. After the model fell apart the bricks and plaster pieces required lengthy rinsing to remove all organic traces to prevent mould growing on them. When well made, models were very realistic and many high road estate agents (realtors) would place a model or two in their shop windows.

Kyphosus sectatrix, the Bermuda chub, Pacific drummer, beaked chub, grey drummer, Pacific chub or white chub, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a sea chub from the family Kyphosidae. This species is found in tropical and subtropical coastal waters worldwide. It has had a confused taxonomic history dating back to Linnaeus's naming of the species in 1758. Description Kyphosus sectatrix has an elliptical body which is almost circular when looked at from the side, with a head than slopes from over the eye to the snout, making the fish appear to be beaked or snouted. It lacks an obvious bulge on its forehead and it has a small, horizontal mouth which opens at the front. . There is a regular row of incisorform J shaped teeth with rounded tips which are set close together in the jaws which have their bases set horizontally creating something like a bony plate with radial striations within the mouth. Ctenoid scales cover most of the body apart from the snout. The dorsal fin is continuous, and has its origin quite far to the rear of the head but is till longer than the anal fin. The dorsal fin contains 11 spines and 11-12 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 11 soft rays. The caudal fin is emarginate but not deeply so. The lateral line has 63-81 scales of which 50-62 have pores. This species may attain a maximum total length of but a total length of around is mor common, the maximum weight attained is . The colour of this species can be variable, normally it is greenish to bronze dorsally fading to pale greyish on the flanks and to silvery ventrally. There are faint gold horizontal lines on the body and there is frequently a white or silvery streak on the cheek below the eye, and a narrow pale stripe below the dorsal fin base. Sometimes individuals which are bright yellow in colour occur and these often have blotches or patches of black along with areas of paler yellow or whitish colour. The juveniles are grey and have white or pale spots on their bodies and fins. Distribution Kyphosus sectatrix has a circumglobal distribution and is found in the warmer areas of all the world's oceans. In the eastern Atlantic Ocean it has been recorded from St Helena and Ascension Island the Azores, the Canary Islands, it has been reported from the Algarve in Portugal and there are records from the Mediterranean. In the western Atlantic it is found off Bermuda, in the Sargasso Sea, in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. It has been recorded from the Trinidade Islands of Brazil. It is thought likely that it occurs along the coast of northwest Africa and as far north as Portugal. In the Indian Ocean it has been recorded from R√©union and Indonesia but likely is far more widespread and probably occurs along the eastern African coast into the Red Sea and along the southern Asian coast. In the western Pacific it has been recorded from southern Japan to the Coral Sea and northern New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands, along the eastern coast of Australia from Heron Island, Queensland to Ulladulla, New South Wales and in the Tasman Sea from Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island. It extends across the Pacific through Polynesia to Hawaii] and at least as far east as the Revillagigedo Islands. Habitat and biology Kyphosus sectatrix forms schools, often mixed with other related species, on shallow reefs, frequently these are observed in the surge zone but it also occurs above algal reefs and in seagrass beds, over sandy and rocky substrates, and reef flats. Juveniles commonly shelter among floating rafts of Sargassum and this allows them to disperse over vast distances. This is an omnivorous species which feeds mostly on benthic algae and also on as well as on small crabs and molluscs. Off the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago in the southeast Atlantic it has been observed feeding on the faeces and vomit of spinner dolphins (Stenella spp) and this feeding off mammalian waste has been suggested to be simple behavioural change from feeding on plankton to picking out drifting particles of waste. When feeding on algae they appear to prefer brown algae. Taxonomy Kyphosus sectatrix was first formally described and named as Perca saltatrix by Linnaeus in 1758 but changed it to Perca sectatrix in 1766 as he had intended to base the name on Mark Catesby's previous name for the \\"rudderfish\\" Perca marina sectatrix and the uses of salatatrix had been a lapsus. Given the circumglobal distribution of this species and the difficulty of identification a number of names have been assigned to populations around the world which have since been shown by morphological and molecular studies to be junior synonyms of K. sectatrix. These include Kyphosus pacificus which was described in 2004 as distinct from Kyphosus bigibbus in the Pacific but the workers did not compare K. pacificus with any specimens from the Atlantic. Another synonym is K. lutescens from the Revillagigedo Islands which was named by David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert in 1889 and based on yellow specimens taken there but this taxon is also probably a junior synonym of K. sectatrix.

During World War I, he was an adviser to the Minister of Food and advocated the establishment of a Ministry of Health. Life Saleeby was born in Sussex, the son of Elias G. Saleeby. His father died whilst he was young and his mother moved to 3 Malta Terrace in Stockbridge, Edinburgh.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1895 He was educated at the Royal High School in Edinburgh. At Edinburgh University, he took First Class Honours and was an Ettles Scholar and Scott Scholar in Obstetrics. In 1904, he received his Doctor of Medicine degree. He was a resident at the Maternity Hospital and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, and briefly at the York City Dispensary. In 1906 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Alexander Russell Simpson, Sir Thomas Clouston, Sir William Turner and Daniel John Cunningham. He became a prolific freelance writer and journalist, with strong views on many subjects. He became known in particular as an advocate of eugenics: in 1907 he was influential in launching the Eugenics Education Society, and in 1909 he published (in New York) Parenthood and Race Culture. He was a contributor to the first edition of Arthur Mee's The Children's Encyclop√¶dia. Like Mee, he was a keen temperance reformer. Saleeby's contributions to the Encyclopedia were explicitly racialist: he saw mankind as the pinnacle of evolution, and white men as superior to other men, based on \\"craniometry\\". He predicted the use of atomic power, \\"perhaps not for hundreds of years\\". He favoured the education of women, but primarily so they should become better mothers. In Woman and Womanhood (1912), he wrote: \\"Women, being constructed by Nature, as individuals, for her racial ends, are happier and more beautiful, live longer and more beautiful lives, when they follow, as mothers or foster-mothers the role of motherhood\\". Yet, at this time when the suffragette movement was at its peak, he also wrote that he could see no good reason against the vote for women: \\"I believe in the vote; I believe it will be eugenic\\". During World War I, he was an adviser to the Minister of Food and argued in favour of the establishment of a Ministry of Health. Later, he moved away from eugenics, and did not publish any further writings on this subject after 1921‚Äîthough he continued to write on health matters in particular. He also campaigned for clean air and the benefits of sunlight, founding The Sunlight League in 1924. Although the Sunlight League did not overtly promote nudism Saleeby did confide to friends that the idea behind it was to stimulate the nudist movement. Saleeby founded a nudist club in Britain in the 1920s exhorting the nudist lifestyle in his book Sunlight and Health. He died on 9 December 1940 from heart failure at Apple Tree, Aldbury, near Tring. Cancer research Saleeby was a proponent of the trophoblastic theory of cancer first proposed by embryologist John Beard. He authored the book The Conquest of Cancer, in 1908. Family He married Monica Meynell, daughter of Alice Meynell and Wilfrid Meynell, in June 1903. They had two daughters, Mary and Cordelia. In 1910, his marriage fell apart after his wife had a nervous breakdown. During this time, their daughter Mary, was sent to live with Viola Meynell. D.H. Lawrence was living at her family's cottage in Sussex. He became Mary's tutor. In 1930 he married Muriel Gordon Billings.

Life Thomas Weldon was born at 3 Bryanston Mansions, York Street, Marylebone, London, in 1896. After an education at Tonbridge School, he won a scholarship to read Literae humaniores at Magdalen College, Oxford, which he postponed to become an officer in the Royal Field Artillery in 1915. He spent World War I in France and Belgium, rising to acting captain, being wounded and winning the Military Cross and bar. He finally went up to Oxford in 1919, graduating with a first class degree in 1921. Weldon was elected a fellow and philosophy tutor at his college two years later, getting to know C. S. Lewis. He then served as Rhodes travelling fellow in 1930. During World War II, he was a temporary civil servant in London from 1939 to 1942, then Personal Staff Officer to \\"Bomber Harris\\" in RAF Bomber Command at High Wycombe from 1942 to 1945. His final duties there involved justifying Harris's controversial bombing strategy to politicians and the public. His death in 1958 was attributed by college rumour to suicide but was in fact due to a cerebral haemorrhage.Additional biographical information found in T.D. Weldon, The Vocabulary of Politics (Penguin, 1960) Characterization of teaching style In a review in the London Review of Books of a newly published work by Niall Ferguson, R. W. Johnson said that it amounted to a tutorial: \\"The idea is to teach the young to think and argue, and the real past masters at it (Harry Weldon was always held up as an example to me) were those who first argued undergraduates out of their received opinions, then turned around after a time and argued them out of their new-found radicalism, leaving them mystified as to what they believed and suspended in a free-floating state of cleverness.\\" Works *Introduction to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1945; 2nd ed., 1958) *States and Morals (1946) *The Vocabulary of Politics (1953) References * *R.W.

Desiring to improve his diction he spent long nights exercising his voice with extracts of the Penal Code. In 1962, at age 21, he played Estragon in Waiting for Godot at the \\"Piccolo Teatro\\" of Naples.\\"En m√©moire de Vittorio Mezzogiorno by Saverio Ferragina In 1966‚Äì1967, he joined the troupe of Eduardo De Filippo and obtained his university diploma. In 1969, he met actress Cecilia Sacchi.The Magic Baton: Toscanini's Life for Music, √©ditions Kessinger LLC, 2007 Their collaboration quickly turned to a romantic relationship and they were married on 14 October 1972.

The Mahabharata in English was back on the road in 1988: Zurich, Los Angeles, New York, Perth, Adelaide, Copenhagen, Glasgow, and finally Tokyo. In 1989, the movie adaptation was produced. In all, Mezzogiorno has played Arjuna for 6 years on 4 continents. In 1990, Vittorio Mezzogiorno returned to Italy and settled in Milan.

Pinky and her husband Ra√∫l Lavi√©, 1964 Lidia Elsa Satragno (born November 11, 1935) is an entertainer and politician in Argentina, where she's popularly known as Pinky. Life and times Lidia Elsa Satragno was born in the western Buenos Aires suburb of San Justo in 1935. She debuted on Argentine television in a 1956 vinegar advertisement and, by 1957, appeared on as many as 22 television ads on any given day. This success led to her own talk show on Argentine Public Television, Buenos D√≠as Pinky, during which she was invited as a guest of honor by German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. The show also earned renown for its screenwriter, Mar√≠a Elena Walsh, and helped pave the way for women in Argentine television, generally. Cast by noted period piece Director Leopoldo Torre Nilsson in La ca√≠da (The Fall) in 1959, in 1961 she was offered a co- anchorship in news anchorman Bernardo Neustadt's Nosotros (Us), becoming the first Argentine woman on television so honored. Co-hosting Incomunicados with Neustadt in 1963, the show became memorable for an interview held with Arturo Frondizi, the first granted by a former President on Argentine television. Her work with Neustadt and introduction to the world of politics led to a friendship with a young UCR strategist, Rodolfo Terragno, that she maintains to the present day. Pinky hosted or co-hosted a number of other talk and variety shows during the 1960s and 1970s, the most successful of which were Femin√≠sima, El pueblo quiere saber (People Want to Know), Pinky y la noticia (Pinky and the News) and La d√©cada del '60. She set time aside for other projects, as well, cast by Argentine and Mexican directors in a number of film roles in the 1960s. One of her interview guests in 1962, a rising figure in Argentine tango named Ra√∫l Lavi√©, had recently been separated and quickly developed a relationship with the avuncular hostess; the two were married in 1965. Enjoying a stellar career, she soon became known as \\"Ms. Television\\" in Argentina, though her private life entered a difficult phase. She and Lavi√© had two sons, but soon grew apart and were separated and reunited a number of times before parting ways in 1974, something Pinky has attributed to infidelity on his part.Clar√≠n She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1970, but recovered a few years later. Pinky was among the stars on hand to inaugurate Argentine color television broadcasting in 1978 but soon fell out of favor with the prevailing dictatorship, however, after agreeing to interview Norma Aleandro, a renowned actress and dissident. This led her to turn to Argentina's vibrant theatre scene, where she accepted leading roles in local productions of Two Women, The Vagina Monologues and The Prisoner of Second Avenue, among others. Pinky produced a successful Buenos Aires presentation of Annie, as well. Her decision to cohost a 1982 television fundraiser devoted to the ongoing Falklands War cost the hostess professional clout following the advent of democracy in 1983, whose victorious UCR she supported, ironically. Continuing to host a number of radio and television shows, she relocated to Azul, where she hosted the nationally-broadcast La d√©cada del '80. Pinky became officially affiliated to the struggling, centrist Radical Civic Union following that party's 1995 election of Rodolfo Terragno as its President and, in 1999, she ran on the UCR-led Alliance for Mayor of La Matanza County, the most populous district in the Province of Buenos Aires. Claiming victory after early returns on election night put her narrowly ahead, she was forced to concede defeat later in the evening after a complete tally gave the Justicialist (Peronist) Party candidate, Alberto Balestrini, a narrow edge. Buenos Aires Mayor Enrique Olivera named her Secretary of Social Policy Promotion for the city in 2000, where she earned plaudits for her efforts against domestic violence. She returned to television to host Pinky y la conversaci√≥n in 2001 and was awarded the prestigious Mart√≠n Fierro Award for Broadcasting Excellence in 2006. Having appeared for over 30,000 hours on Argentine television, she announced her intention to run for a seat in the Argentine Lower House of Congress to represent the San Justo area she was raised in and continued to live in. Running on the center-right Republican Proposal ticket founded by businessman (and current Buenos Aires Mayor) Mauricio Macri, Pinky was elected to Congress in October 2007. Her two sons, Leonardo and Gast√≥n Satragno, formed Ultratango in 2003, a musical group performing in the Nuevo tango genre. Following the 2009 mid-term elections, and at 74 years of age, Pinky became the dean of the Lower House of Congress, presiding over the December 4 session that elected the body's new leadership.

They conducted Nazi security warfare in the rear of the advancing German troops and took part in the Holocaust. The unit also filled gaps in the front line when called upon in emergencies. In 1944, the brigade was used as the cadre in the formation of the SS Division Horst Wessel. Invasion of the Soviet Union The 1 SS Infantry Brigade (mot) was formed from concentration camp guards, on 21 April 1941, from men of the SS-Totenkopfverb√§nde (concentration camp guards). It received the designation of the 1st SS Infantry Brigade (motorised) on 20 September 1941. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa) in June 1941, the brigade was stationed in Krak√≥w, Poland awaiting its full complement of men and materials. On 23 July the unit moved east into the occupied territories and between July and August 1941, mopping up dispersed Red Army units in the rear of Army Group South. On 9 August, the brigade was north of Zhitomir and was asked to cover the northern flank of the 6th Army in the Pinsk Marshes. The brigade next operated behind the XVII Army Corps and on 23 August, crossed the Dnieper River. During the remainder of the year and until late 1942 the unit was assigned to the Reich Security Main Office, which also had the SS Cavalry Brigade and the 2nd SS Infantry Brigade under command.Hannes Heer, War of Extermination, p.136 In the autumn of 1941, the brigade actively took part in the Holocaust as part of Einsatzgruppe C and took part in the liquidation of the Jewish population of the Soviet Union, forming firing parties when required. The three brigades were responsible for the murder of tens of thousands of the population by the end of 1941, and they destroyed at least one village st Bia≈Çystok for no apparent reason as they had not been engaged from it. On 12 December 1941, the brigade was placed under the command of the 56th Infantry Division on the orders of Army Group Center when a gap appeared in the front line of the 2nd Army in the area of Tula, Yelets Liwny. On 28 December 1941, the unit was placed under the command of LV Army Corps. 1942 The brigade spent the winter in fighting defensive battles in the front line, then received new orders. They were again to form a rear-area security unit. From January to August they took part in security and defensive duties around the area of Kursk and a new commander, Karl Fischer von Treuenfeld, arrived in July. The unit remained in the Kursk area until 11 August when it was sent to the Minsk area. On 11 October, the brigade was in the Wydriza sector in Central Russia (where Erich von dem Bach-Zelewsky was the SS and Police Leader). It took part in the Operation Karlsbad (11 September to 23 October); also participating were the SS-Sturmbrigade Dirlewanger, SS Schuma Battalion 255 and the 1st Battalion, L√©gion des Volontaires Fran√ßais. By the end of it the brigade had recorded the killing of 1051 civilians and alleged partisans for the loss of 24 dead and 65 wounded. The brigade next took part in the Operation Freda (5 to 9 November), together with the SS-Sturmbrigade Dirlewanger near Borissov. The reported casualties from the operation were light with 2 men killed and 10 missing compared to several hundred dead \\"partisans\\", most likely civilians. The unit was next used in another security action, Operation N√ºrnberg (19 to 25 November), with Police Kampfgruppe von Gottberg. The operation took place between Gleboki and Wilna. The operation was under the command of Brigadef√ºhrer Curt von Gottberg with SS Polizei Regiment 14, two Schuma battalions and a town Gendarmerie unit in support of the 1 SS Infantry Brigade.

At the end of 1942 they were involved in the Battle of Velikiye Luki when the Soviet forces encircled the town of Velikiye Luki. The 83rd Infantry Division which was trapped in the pocket and was destroyed. The 1 SS Infantry Brigade, along with Frikorps Danmark, who had participated in the attempts to break the encirclement under Kampfgruppe Chevallerie had suffered heavy casualties in the process. 1943 In 1943 the brigade came under the command of the LIX Corps in the 3rd Panzer Army. On 4 February they were located at Podluschje. They took part in Operation Kugelblitz (22 February to 8 March) attached to the 201st Sicherungs Division. Operation Kugelblitz was an anti Belarusian partisans sweep in the area of Witebsk Gorodok Gurki and Senniza Lake. They also took part in the followup Operation Donnerkeil (31 March to 2 April) the second operation was ordered by the 3rd Panzer Army. In May 1943, the brigade formed a cadre for the 3 Estonian SS Volunteer Brigade and on 7 July it was sent to Borrissov on another security sweep. They participated in Operation Hermann (7 July) with various other units under the command of Generalmajor of Polizei von Gottberg. On 1 August, the brigade took part in the security and depopulation operation in the area Jeremicze-Starzyna-Rudnja-Kupinsk. The goal was to murder or deport the local population and seize livestock and agricultural supplies. They were again moved into the front line in September to reinforce the 25th Panzergrenadier Division, which was fighting in the Smolensk-Gomel sector. Smolensk was abandoned on 24 September and the brigade reported that during the fighting they had lost 215 killed in action, 1172 wounded and 77 missing. On 12 November, the brigade units were redesignated the former SS Infantry Regiment 8 and SS Infantry Regiment 10 now became known as the SS Grenadier Regiment 39 and SS Grenadier Regiment 40. To counter the Soviet offensive on 10 November the Brigade formed SS Kampfgruppe Trabandt which came under the command of the 36th Infantry Division. They fought at the Rogatschew bridgehead until they were transferred to the bridgehead at Stassewka on 2 December. 1 SS Infantry Brigade January 1944, Standartenf√ºhrer Wilhelm Trabandt in the front row In December, the brigade took part in Operation Nikolaus which started on 20 December and formed the 9th Army's southern pincer group attacking towards the 2nd Army alongside the 16th Panzer Division, 258th Infantry Division, 134th Infantry Divisions and Cavalry Regiment Mitte. The counterattack filled the gap between the 2nd and 9th Army's which had been created by the Soviet push towards Bobruisk in November that year. The attack was succeeded and the gap was closed on 22 December. At the end of December 1943 the Brigade was ordered to move to East Prussia. After they reached the troop training grounds Stablack near K√∂nigsberg they were reformed. 1944 The 1 SS Infantry Brigade (mot) was disbanded on 24 January 1944 when it was used to form the 18th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Horst Wessel. War crimes The brigade took an active part in the killing of the Jewish population assisting the Einsatzgruppen, in the town of Ushomir where it took part in the killing of all male Jews. Untersturmf√ºhrer Max T√§ubner commanded a workshop detail in the brigade and was tried by an SS court in May 1943, along with four other Waffen-SS men, for unauthorized and sadistic killings of a large number of Jews in 1941 and for taking photos of the killings showing them to wife and friends. In the indictment, the SS court states \\"The accused allowed his men to act with such vicious brutality that they conducted themselves under his command like a savage horde\\". The case against four other defendants under T√§ubner's command was dismissed by the judge Standartenf√ºhrer Dr. Reinecke. The photos and negatives were later ordered to be destroyed.Goldsworthy, Valhalla's Warriors: A history of the Waffen-SS on the Eastern Front 1941‚Äì1944 T√§ubner, who had been given a sentence of 10 years, was pardoned in January 1945 and released from prison.Klee, Dressen, and Riess, eds, The Good Old Days: The Holocaust as Seen by Its Perpetrators and Bystanders, p. 205-207. In another version of this trial cited in Mazower, Mark (2008) Hitler's Empire, pg 409 Taubner is convicted of disregarding secrecy provisions surrounding the exterminations, expelled from the SS, deprived of his civil rights and sentenced to ten years imprisonment, for behavior that was \\"unworthy of an honorable and decent German man.\\" Vasyl Valdeman, a Jewish resident of Ostroh reported: \\"We knew something would be done to us here. When we saw people hit and driven along here with spades, even small children realised why people were carrying the spades.\\" One of the members of the 1st SS Infantry Brigade at the time was Hans Friedrich. He claims not to recall exactly which actions he took part in that summer, but he does admit to participating in killings like the one in Ostrog. \\"They were so utterly shocked and timid, you could do with them what you wanted.'\\" Vasyl Valdeman: \\"Kids were crying, the sick were crying, the elderly were praying to God. Not on their knees but seated or lying down. It was very tough to go through it all, hearing all this wailing and crying. Then they had everyone get up and said 'Go', and as soon as people started moving, they selected people for shooting, for execution.\\" The selected Ukrainian Jews were taken out to this spot and a pit was dug. In scenes which were repeated right across the areas of the Soviet Union occupied by the Nazis, men, women and children were ordered to strip and prepare to die. The killings went on into the evening. Vasyl Valdeman and his mother managed to escape and hide in a nearby village. But the SS killed his father, grandfather and two uncles. Vasyl Valdeman: \\"That's how it was‚Äîthe first execution‚Äîthe most horrible one. It wasn't the last one. There were three more large executions after that with 2000 to 3000 people shot at every one of them. More people were executed afterwards in smaller scale ones and this is how the Jewish community of Ostrog was annihilated.\\" Casualties Between formation in 1941 and January 1944 the Brigade reported the following casualties, from an establishment of 6,271 officers and men: *Killed 20 officers, 306 NCOs and other ranks *Wounded 38 officers, 805 NCOs and other ranks *Missing 4 officers, 119 NCOs and other ranksMunoz Forgotten Legions Commanders *Brigadef√ºhrer Karl Demelhuber, (24 April 1941 ‚Äì 25 June 1941) *Oberf√ºhrer Richard Herrmann, (25 June 1941 ‚Äì 27 December 1941) *Brigadef√ºhrer Wilhelm Hartenstein (27 December 1941 ‚Äì November 1942) *Obergruppenf√ºhrer Erich von dem Bach-Zelewsky (December 1942) *Brigadef√ºhrer Wilhelm Harenstein (December 1942 ‚Äì May 1943) *Brigadef√ºhrer Karl Herrmann (31 July 1943 ‚Äì October 1943) *Sturmbannf√ºhrer Wilhelm Trabandt (18 October 1943 ‚Äì 24 Jan 1944) Footnotes Bibliography *Terry Goldsworthy, Valhalla's Warriors: A history of the Waffen-SS on the Eastern Front 1941‚Äì1945 *Hannes Heer & Klaus Naumann (eds.), War of Extermination: The German Military in World War II 1941‚Äì1944, Berghahn Books, 2000, *Ernst Klee, Willi Dressen, Volker Riess ‚Äì The Good Old Days: The Holocaust as Seen by Its Perpetrators SS01 Category:Security units of Nazi Germany established in 1941 0*01 Category:Security units of Nazi Germany disestablished in 1944 ","title":"1st SS Infantry Brigade"},{"id":"21574855","text":"Michael Darlow (born 13 June 1934) is a British television producer, director and writer. After starting as an actor, his first short film was seen by documentary film maker John Grierson and shown on TV and at the 1960 Edinburgh Film Festival. Darlow's documentary, drama and arts programmes have won international awards including BAFTAs, an Emmy, and Gold at the New York Television Festival. His works include The World At War episode Genocide, The Barretts of Wimpole Street, Johnny Cash at San Quentin and Bomber Harris. He is a Fellow of the Royal Television Society. Early life and education Darlow was born in Wolverhampton, where his father was the deputy town clerk and his mother was a socialist and feminist organizer. When Darlow was a child, his father became town clerk of West Bromwich. During the war, Darlow, his younger brother, and their mother were evacuated to Little Marlow in Buckinghamshire. He has said that it was while attending a pantomime in Little Marlow that he began to be ‚Äúsmitten‚Äù by the theatre. Later, as a student at a preparatory school in Bishop‚Äôs Stortford, he belonged to the school‚Äôs Dramatic Society and was involved in student productions. Through his mother he met Esme Church, who ran an acting and liberal arts school in Bradford, largely for working-class students from northern England. Although he passed an audition for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, he decided to attend Church‚Äôs school instead, which had a ‚Äúsocialist feeling‚Äù that he appreciated. While there, he developed anger over social inequality in the UK.Michael Darlow; History Preoject; Military service Following his graduation from Church‚Äôs school, Darlow performed his National Service by serving as a radar officer in the Royal Air Force. During his time in the RAF, he learned a good deal about electronics, which would prove useful in his TV career.Michael Darlow; History Preoject; Show-business career After completing his military service, Darlow began work as a theatre actor. He appeared on television for the first time on New Year‚Äôs Day 1959, in a drama on BBC1. His first line of dialogue on TV was improvised because the actress in the scene went up on her line. He went on to act in several TV programs during the late 1950s and early 1960s.Michael Darlow; History Preoject; In 1959, he began acting in the West End production of the play The World of Suzie Wong, ultimately appearing in more than 800 performances. As a side activity, Darlow helped found a small company of actors who put on new plays on Sunday nights. The group was partly subsidized by the author C. P. Snow. It was there that he began to work as a professional theatre director. He wrote and directed a documentary film entitled All These People (1960) about the history of the city of Reading and then another, The Holloway Road, about that thoroughfare in London. Both were shown at Edinburgh Film Festival. During the early 1960s, he acted for about a year in the West End production of Bonne Suppe, a play starring Coral Browne. His first work as a TV director was for the BBC in Bristol, where he answered to John Boorman. He worked as a researcher on a documentary history of the trade-union movement. He went on to work at Granada TV, where he was the associate producer of Ten Days that Shook the World, a 1967 documentary marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Russian Revolution. It was the first television collaboration between Britain and the Soviet Union. After several long visits to the Soviet Union, he decided to do a TV documentary about the Siege of Leningrad during World War II. It ended up being a three-part 1968 series about three cities under siege. In addition to Leningrad, it covered the London Blitz and the destruction of Berlin at the end of World War II. Darlow served as director and producer on all three parts. He went on to direct Johnny Cash at San Quentin, a 1969 documentary. He later recalled that a Johnny Cash concert in San Diego ‚Äúfelt like a neo-Nazi racist rally.‚Äù After filming the Cash documentary, he parted ways with Granada Films owing to creative differences, although he would later work again with the company on individual projects. In the 1960s he also directed episodes of the TV series Coronation Street. During the early 1970s he directed The Hero of My Life, a TV movie about Charles Dickens, as well as TV documentaries about filmmakers Denis Mitchell and Fran√ßois Truffaut and the painter J. M. W. Turner. Darlow also directed a stage production of Look Back in Anger at the Derby Playhouse.Michael Darlow; History Preoject; He directed two episodes of the comprehensive 26-part documentary series The World at War (1974), narrated by Laurence Olivier and produced by Thames Television. Darlow‚Äôs episodes covered the occupation of the Netherlands and the Holocaust. For the latter episode he interviewed former Nazis as well as Holocaust victims. He shot over six hours of film, and since there was too much to include in a single episode of The World at War, much of the extra footage was used for two other projects. One of them was Secretary to Hitler (1974), a 23-minute documentary short in which Darlow interviewed Hitler‚Äôs private secretary Traudl Junge. The other project was aired in 1975 as the miniseries The Final Solution. He went on to make the TV movie Hazlitt in Love (1977). In 1979, he directed the TV miniseries Crime and Punishment, starring John Hurt, and the TV movie Suez 1956, about British Prime Minister Anthony Eden and the Suez crisis of 1956. Between 1979 and 1990 he directed a number of TV plays for the BBC, ITV, and Granada, including Little Eyolf, The Master Builder, and The Winslow Boy, while also continuing to direct TV documentaries and music programs. He also directed the six-part TV miniseries Merlin of the Crystal Cave (1991), the TV movies Bomber Harris (1989) and A Bright New Hope for Mankind (1993), and programs for the TV documentary series The Works and Forty Minutes. Books In connection with a television program he directed about Oman, he and Richard Fawkes co-wrote The Last Corner of Arabia, a non-fiction book about that country. After compiling the BBC‚Äôs video obituary for the playwright Terence Rattigan, Darlow wrote a biography of Rattigan.Michael Darlow; History Preoject; Other professional activities During much of his career he was active in efforts to reform the British Film Institute and the BBC. When the possibility of a fourth TV channel was raised, in addition to the two BBC channels and the one ITV channel, he was involved in the successful attempt to prevent ITV from taking control of it. This campaign led to the formation of Channel 4.Michael Darlow; History Preoject; Personal life He considers himself a member of the ‚Äúprogressive left.‚ÄùMichael Darlow; History Project; Honors and awards Darlow was nominated for BAFTA Awards for Best Single Play (Suez 1956, 1979), for Best Factual Programme (The Final Solution, 1979; The World at War, 1973), and for Best Single Drama (Bomber Harris, 1989).

He was one of the most popular fight announcers from the turn of the 20th century up until the 1930s. In his near 50-year career, Humphreys was estimated to have announced over 20,000 boxing matches and officiated many of the top prize fights of the era as the longtime official ring announcer at the old Madison Square Garden from 1925 up to his death in 1936. Biography Joseph Edward Humphreys was born in New York City on October 17, 1872. He grew up at 54 Oliver Street in the Lower East Side, not far from the birthplace of future Governor of New York Alfred E. Smith, and who later was a childhood friend. His father died when he was 11 years old and became a newsboy to help support his family. During his years as a newsboy, he was known as a \\"lusty-lunged youngster\\" whose voice led him to obtain a position at the New York Produce Exchange as a broker's page. To make some extra money, Humphreys also began singing in clubs, smokers and benefits. At age 15, he was a bartender and later became a mascot of the old Nonpareil Athletic Club where he was originally introduced to boxing. It was while performing at Gus Maisch's Little Casino in 1888, a popular establishment near New Bowery, that he agreed to be a last minute replacement as the night's official ring announcer when the regular man was unable to appear. Humphreys became an instant success and became a full-time announcer.\\"Joe Humphreys, 63, Sports Figure, Dies; Boxing Announcer 43 Years, He Officiated at Famous Championship Fights. Began Work As Newsboy; Boyhood Chum of Ex-Gov. Smith, He Was Singer Before Voice Won Him Chance in Ring\\". _New York Times._ 11 July 1936 By the early 20th century, Humphreys had become the single most popular boxing announcer in the New York-area. Harry Grayson, boxing writer for the New York World-Telegram once wrote, \\"Joe Humphreys had voice, presence, personality, tact, and razorblade Irish wit\\". He was particularly known for his distinctive and colorful announcing style, mannerisms and catchphrases, most notably, \\"the win-ah and new champion!\\" when announcing a title change. He was also able to silence noisy and unruly crowds by shouting \\"Quiet please!\\" following with a \\"mollifying spread of his arms\\". In August 1910, he and actor Raymond Hitchcock purchased the original Chinese Theatre in Chinatown, Manhattan and turned it into the first movie theatre in the area. The movie house failed to catch on in the Chinese-American community, partly due to the ongoing Tong wars, and they eventually sold the property to the New York Rescue Society for use as a mission.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 286, 289) He also developed both close friendships and friendly rivalries with fellow announcers Tim Hurst and Charles J. Harvey, outlasting Harvey when he retired from announcing to become secretary of the New York Boxing Commission following the passage of the Frawley Law in 1911 and eventually became a manager. When Tex Rickard began promoting boxing at the old Madison Square Garden in 1925, Humphreys was hired as official ring announcer and was present at many of the top prize fights held at the venue including Jack Dempsey's bouts against Georges Carpentier, Luis Firpo and Gene Tunney. He was a major fan of Gene Tunney and Jack Dempsey, regarding the latter as \\"the most devastating fighter ever to step in the ring\\". He often claimed that Dempsey's bout against Firpo was \\"the most exciting he had ever witnessed\\". Humphreys was also highly skilled at using current events during his performances. For example, during the Jack Sharkey vs. Jim Maloney on May 20, 1927, he asked the crowd of 40,000 at Yankee Stadium to stand and observe a moment of silence for Charles Lindbergh who had left earlier that day on his transatlantic flight from New York to Paris.Mosley, Leonard. Lindbergh: A Biography. Courier Dover Publications, 2000. (pg. 104) Humphreys also became involved behind the scenes and was associated with Sam H. Harris in the management of then world bantamweight and featherweight champion Terry McGovern. Upon his request, his granddaughter Terry was named in McGovern's honor. In 1929, he publicly stated that he intended to remain an announcer for 50 years. He was never known to take any special care for his voice, save chewing on a cough drop or when his throat became dry, and was opposed to using microphones when they were first introduced at Madison Square Garden. Humphreys suffered a serious stroke in June, 1933 which sidelined him for only two months. He resumed his role August 17th of that year at Madison square garden. He made a few remarks to an enthusiastic crowd. At the third meeting between Barney Ross and Jimmy McLarnin in 1935, he was unable to enter the ring and had to do his introductory announcements from ringside. However, he was so ill that he was unable to attend the championship bout between Max Baer and James J. Braddock on June 13, 1935 and missed the first major fight in his career. He spent a month in the hospital and made his in-ring return at Yankee Stadium, welcomed by the 95,000 fans in attendance, to announce Max Baer-Joe Louis fight on September 24, 1935. Humphreys continued working at Madison Square Garden during the 1935-36 season, but announced only the main events. Although he lived most of his life in New York City, where he exclusively performed during his career, Humphreys spent his later years in Red Bank, New Jersey and New Rochelle, New York. In late-June 1936, Humphreys fell seriously ill and was confined to his home in Fair Haven, New Jersey for three weeks. On the morning of July 10, he apparently collapsed from heat and was unable to speak coherently. Falling into a coma at around 2:00 pm, he died an hour and a half later. His son and daughter-in-law, as well as his grand daughter Terry, were at his bedside at the time of his death. In 1997, Humphreys was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame as a \\"non-participant\\". References Further reading *Durso, Joseph.

The degree is postgraduate, and usually incorporates a thesis or research component. Programs may be offered jointly by the business school and the economics department. The nature of the degree differs by university. Generally, the degree is largely theoretical, and prepares graduates for research positions, for doctoral study in economics, or for roles in applied economics.MS in Applied Financial Economics, John Cook School of Business, Saint Louis University Some are positioned as professional degrees, preparing graduates for careers in investment banking and finance,Financial Economics MSc, University of Leicester and are comparable to the Master of Science in Finance, though with an increased weighting towards economic theory. In some cases, programs are substantially quantitative and are largely akin to a Master of Quantitative Finance. Closely related degrees include the \\"Master of Finance and Economics\\" and the \\"Master of Economics with a specialization in Finance\\".Master of Economics with a specialisation in Financial Economics, Macquarie University Recently, undergraduate degrees in the discipline are offered.e.g.: Kent ; City London; UC Riverside; Leicester; Toronto; UMBC. The degree is gaining in recognition: Oxford's Financial Economics MSc MSc in Financial Economics, Oxford University. is the fourth ranked worldwide amongst all Masters in Finance programs (Pre-experience).FT Rankings: Masters in Finance Pre-experience 2012Note though that Financial Economics programs are not necessarily comparable with generalist programs in finance. Structure Masters in Financial Economics are usually one to one and a half years in duration, and typically include a thesis or research component. The programs require a bachelor's degree prior to admission, but do not (usually) require an undergraduate major in finance or economics; a typical requirement is exposure to (multivariable) calculus and differential equations, statistics and probability theory, and linear algebra. Many programs include a review of these topics as an admission- or preliminary course.Manchester's \\"Pre-Session\\" Mathematics & Statistics MA in Financial Economics, IDC Herzliya Mathematics and Statistics for MA and MFE Students, University of Toronto The curriculum is distributed between theory, applications, and modelling, with the emphasis on each differing by university and program, as above. * The theory component centres on decision making under uncertainty in the context of the financial markets, and the resultant economic and financial models.Outline for ‚ÄòFinancial Economics‚Äô, Royal Holloway, University of London The degree essentially explores how rational investors would apply decision theory to the problem of investment. Investment under \\"certainty\\" is initially considered (Fisher separation theorem, \\"theory of investment value\\", Modigliani-Miller theorem). \\"Choice under uncertainty\\" is then introduced, and the twin assumptions of rationality and market efficiency lead to modern portfolio theory and the CAPM, and to the Black‚ÄìScholes theory for option pricing. Where the program emphasizes economics, the curriculum is extended: it explores phenomena where these assumptions do not hold (noise trading, market microstructure, behavioural finance) and it discusses models which are further generalised (arbitrage pricing theory, continuous time finance / Martingale pricing) or extended (Multi-factor models, models of the short rate, Intertemporal CAPM, Black‚ÄìLitterman model). Coursework here is often titled \\"Asset pricing\\" and \\"Corporate finance theory\\". Economics focused programs (often) separately cover microeconomics and /or decision theory as foundational topics. * Application of the economic principles includes asset allocation and valuation, and covers specific financial instruments ‚Äî such as fixed income, equities, derivatives, foreign exchange ‚Äî and their portfolios. The aim here is twofold: firstly, to complement the theory; secondly, providing graduates with practical market knowledge. In the economics-focused degrees, this coverage may (will) be of secondary importance, while in the professional degrees it is a major component, and often includes separate course work in (practical) corporate finance, portfolio management and financial risk management. Macroeconomics is also usually included; often though, as opposed to covering macroeconomic theory in general, the topics are applied and / or finance related with a focus on modelling and forecasting the relationships between asset classes and their expected returns.See for example: Macroeconomics for Financial Markets, University College Cork; MSc in Financial Economics, Oxford University; MSc in Financial Economics , Cardiff University. * The modelling curriculum complements both of the above. The theory is augmented via the study of econometrics, financial time series and statistical modelling, with a focus on the empirical and statistical testing of economic theory,Birkbeck Financial Economics (MSc) and on developing and documenting new econometric models. Students are taught to model using statistical packages such as SAS and EViews. The applications are reinforced through the computer based implementation of the more complex problems (often including numeric methods for option pricing, Value at risk, constructing efficient portfolios and yield curve modeling). Here, though, the focus is typically on the concept as opposed to the modelling, per se, and may therefore be limited to the spreadsheet environment: Computational finance is the domain of specialized degrees, although some Financial Economics programs do emphasize mathematical modelling and programming. Comparison with other qualifications :See also Outline of finance #Education. There is some overlap with programs in financial engineering, computational finance and mathematical finance; see Master of Quantitative Finance (MQF). These degrees aim to train practitioners and \\"quants\\" ‚Äî i.e. specialists in derivatives, fixed income and risk analysis ‚Äî as opposed to economists, and their curricula are therefore weighted toward stochastic calculus, numerical methods, simulation techniques and programming, and are quantitative (well) beyond the level of the Financial Economics degree. Entrance requirements are similarly more mathematical. On the other hand, coverage of financial and economic theory, and econometrics, while significant, is comparatively secondary.Resolution to Establish a Program Leading to the Master of Science In Financial Economics, Columbia University Senate As mentioned, some Financial Economics programs are substantially quantitative; these differ little from the MQF. The overlap with general finance degrees, such as a Master of Science in Finance (MSF) or an M.B.A. in finance, is further limited, particularly where the Financial Economics program is theory oriented. These degrees are focused on financial management, corporate finance and investment management, and are practice oriented with limited exposure to the underlying economic theory. Since these courses train graduates in the use of the models developed in Financial Economics, the theory is (sometimes) covered in the context of a (basic) understanding of model assumptions. Similar comments apply to professional certifications such as the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation. The Master of Finance (M.Fin.) and M.Sc. Finance, as opposed to the MSF, have a significant theory component (as well as quantitative component), and largely overlap with the master's in Financial Economics.

The bluespotted trevally is distributed through the tropical east Indian and west Pacific Oceans, ranging from Taiwan in the north to Australia in the south. It is an inshore species, found in sandy, muddy and seagrass environments, often in large bays. The bluespotted trevally is distinguished by dark blue spots on its upper body, as well as a number of more detailed anatomical features. It is a benthopelagic predator, taking a variety of crustaceans including crabs and prawns as a juvenile, before shifting to a more fish-dominated diet as an adult. It is one of the most common predators in the Gulf of Carpentaria of northern Australia, and is considered the most important predator of commercially important prawn species. Sexual maturity is reached at 110 mm in length and one year of age, with spawning occurring year round with a peak in spring. Growth is estimated to be 82.2 mm per year for both sexes, reaching a maximum known length of 66 cm. Bluespotted trevally are commonly taken as bycatch in prawn fisheries, however are of little commercial value and often discarded. They are occasionally taken by anglers on lures and baits, but are considered mediocre table fare. Taxonomy and naming The bluespotted trevally is classified within the genus Caranx, one of a number of groups known as the jacks or trevallies. Caranx itself is part of the larger jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, part of the order Carangiformes. The species was first scientifically described by the Australian zoologists Haynes Gibbes Alleyne and Sir William John Macleay based on a specimen collected off Cape Grenville, Queensland, which was later designated to be the holotype. They named the species Caranx bucculentus, with the specific epithet meaning 'with full cheeks' in Latin, referring to the species' wide mouth gape. In the original volume of Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales in which the species was described, the specific name is spelled as bucculantus in the legend, but is considered to be a typographical error and ignored. The species placement in Caranx has never been challenged and no attempts have been made to independently rename the species, making it one of the few members of Caranx to have no synonyms. The commonly used name of 'bluespotted trevally' is in reference to the fishes' body markings, with 'wide-mouthed trevally' also infrequently used. Description The short, sharply curved front section of the lateral line and blue spots distinguish the species The bluespotted trevally is a moderately large fish, growing to a known maximum length of 66 cm. It has a body shape characteristic of many of the larger species of Caranx, possessing a strongly compressed, oblong form with the dorsal profile, particularly anteriorly, much more convex than the ventral profile. The dorsal fin is in two distinct sections, the first consisting of eight spines while the second has one spine and 18 or 19 soft rays. The anal fin consists of two detached spines anteriorly followed by one spine and 15 to 17 soft rays, while the pelvic fin has 1 spine followed by 18 soft rays. The species lateral line is very strongly curved over a short length, becoming straight before the origin of the second dorsal fin, with this straight section over 2.5 times the length of the curved section. The curved section contain 40 to 50 scales while the straight section contains no scales, but 33 to 39 strong scutes. The breast is naked ventrally, with this area extending to behind the origin of the pelvic fins and diagonally to the base of pectoral fins. The eyes have a moderately well-developed posterior adipose eyelid which usually extends to the posterior edge of the pupil. The upper jaw contains an outer row of strong canines and an inner band of villiform teeth, while the lower jaw has only a single band of conical teeth. The species has 26 to 31 gill rakers in total and 24 vertebrae. The bluespotted trevally is a pale olive green above, fading to a more silvery white below, with adults having numerous small blue spots on the upper half of their bodies. The upper end of the opercle has a large dark spot, with a black spot also present at the upper base of the pectoral fins. All the fins are yellow green. Distribution and habitat The bluespotted trevally inhabits the tropical waters of the East Indian-West Pacific Ocean, and is restricted to a smaller range than most of its relatives. The species range extends from the waters of the South China Sea around Taiwan and Borneo south through eastern Indonesia and the Arafura Sea around Papua New Guinea. The species is commonly found off northern Australia, especially the Gulf of Carpentaria, but is occasionally seen as far south as Gladstone, Queensland. The bluespotted trevally is an inshore fish, generally inhabiting coastal waters throughout its range. The species is known to inhabit shallow bays over sand, mud, and rarely seagrass bottoms, as well as slightly deeper waters in bays. Extensive sampling across the Gulf of Carpentaria indicates the maximum biomass for the species occurs at around 28.1 m depth, indicating the species preferentially inhabits substrate of this depth. Biology A bluespotted trevally taken from northern Queensland Considerable research has been conducted on the bluespotted trevally in comparison to most other Indo-Pacific carangids, with this being partly due to the discovery of its abundance and importance in northern Australian shallow water ecosystems. It is one of the top ten most abundant secondary consumers in the system and the most important predator of commercially important prawn species. Successive sampling periods over a period between 1986 and 1991 found no systematic seasonal variations in the species abundance, although interannual variations in numbers occurred. The species also appears to undergo diel vertical migrations as evidenced by markedly decreased catches in demersal night trawls, possibly in response to prey movement. Bluespotted trevally are predatory fish, consuming a range of crustaceans and fish. Studies in the Gulf of Carpentaria and in particular, Albatross Bay, indicate the species is most common over known prawn grounds. A shift in diet happens with age, with young fish less than 275 mm in length taking penaeids, brachyurans, other crustaceans, echinoderms, and molluscs, while larger fish take mostly small fish. The smaller trevally tend to forage during the day, taking species of small noncommercial species of prawns, while the larger fish took larger, commercially important species at night. Experimental studies indicate the species has low success foraging in seagrass beds and over soft strata where penaeids burrow during the day, but increased efficiency during the night when the prawns emerge to forage. There appears to be little seasonal variation in diet. Bluespotted trevally reach sexual maturity at around 110 mm in length, usually after their first year of life. This is much earlier than other members of the genus, which attain similar lengths and reach maturity in their second or third years of life. The species spawns year round in the Gulf of Carpentaria with a peak in spring, with between 18,000 and 650,000 eggs released during spawning. The bluespotted trevally grows at a rate of around 82.2 mm per year. Intensive feeding experiments indicate the species can increase its weight by 3.7% and 2.7% of its body weight per day when fed prawns and pilchards, respectively. Relationship to humans Despite the large populations of bluespotted trevally, particularly in northern Australia, no major fishery is based around the species. They are taken by trawls and hook-and-line methods throughout their range, but form a considerable proportion of some prawn-trawler bycatches. Despite this, they are generally considered of no worth due to their mediocre reputation as table fish, as well as the possibility of ciguatera poisoning from larger specimens. Bluespotted trevally are occasionally caught by recreational fishermen on various baits and lures, and are considered to a good sport fish, but tend to be overshadowed by giant trevally and bluefin trevally in reputation.

Background The lottery, which was a national equivalent of earlier localised lotteries in support of hospital services, had a jackpot of ¬£200,000, and even progressed as far as the issuing of tickets and a prize draw in May 1988. The scheme was approved by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in April 1988, and it was estimated that a single draw could have raised up to ¬£500,000 for the NHS.Peter Sharp (journalist), report on ITN News at Ten, May 1988 Cancellation Although the National Health Lottery scheme was based upon earlier localised lotteries designed to generate funds for health services, by becoming national in scope, the scheme contravened the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976. The scheme was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions by the Gaming Board of Great Britain on 16 May 1988, halting the lottery before the first winner could be announced.Written Answers (Commons) HC Debate 7 June 1988 vol 134 c447W, Hansard The Attorney-General, Sir Patrick Mayhew reported in the House of Commons in July 1988 that letters were written on 23 and 24 May to the company responsible for running the lottery indicating that the director would request police inquiries if the lottery draw took place. The issue later appeared at Prime Minister's Questions on 27 October 1988: > Mr. Janner: \\"Does the Prime Minister recall recently endorsing a lottery > intended to benefit the grossly under-resourced National Health Service and > then having to remove her endorsement when the lottery turned out to be > illegal?

The origin and history of the name \\"Chemjong\\" comes from the era of Lasahang (LashaHang) which was during the 7th century AD.History of Limbuwan The fifth king of Lasahang dynasty was King Chemjong Hang. He was born in Chempojong palace in Ilam, where his mother was living. When he was born his mother had to keep him away from everyone, fearing that Chief Pathong Hang's people would come and murder him. She told him that his father's enemy would destroy him if they were to find out his true identity. He grew up to be a wise and strong individual. His mother having told him of his late father's followers in the northern part of Limbuwan, he made his way there and forged alliances with the chiefs. He made a surprise attack while everyone at Hellang palace was celebrating the marriage of one of the district chiefs. After capturing Hellang palace, he revealed his identity to all those present and they accepted him as the true ruler and heir of the late King Wedo Hang. Since he had no real name and that he was born in the old palace of Chempojong, the assembled chiefs decided to name him Chemjong Hang, which became his name. He once again tried to unite all of Limbuwan and succeeded in extending from present-day Panchthar, Illam, Dhankuta, Sunsari, Morang and Jhapa. Back in those days Morang composed of the lower terai lands of Sunsari, Morang and Jhapa, while northern Limbuwan was still in fragments. Ancient history The Ten Kings of Limbus came together to formally declare all the ten kingdoms between the Arun River and Teesta River to be called \\"Yakthung Laaje\\". The ten rulers, their kingdoms and their forts: *1. Samlupi Samba Hang, King of Tambar and his capital Tambar Yiok. *2. Sisiyen Shering Hang, King of Mewa and Maiwa kingdoms and his capital Meringden Yiok. *3. Thoktokso Angbo Hang, King of Athraya and his capital Pomajong. *4. Thindolung Khokya Hang, King of Yangwarok and his capital Hastapojong Yiok *5. Yengaso Papo Hang, King of Panthar and his capital at Yashok and Pheden (Phe meaning \\"plain\\", den meaning \\"place\\"). *6. Shengsengum Phedap Hang, King of Phedap and his capital at Poklabung. *7. Mung Tai Chi Emay Hang, King of Ilam and his capital at Phakphok. *8. Soiyak Ladho Chemjong Hang, King of Bodhey (Choubise) and his capital at Shanguri Yiok. *9. Tappeso Perung Hang, King of Thala and his capital at Thala Yiok. *10. Taklung Khewa Hang, King of Chethar and his capital at Chamling Chimling Yiok. Rise of King Morang After a brief period, King Mawrong Hang came to prominence and took over Terai lands of Chethar, Bodhey, Panthar and Ilam (present day Jhapa, Morang Sunsari and Dhankuta). He named his Kingdom Morang after his name and rose to power. He subdued all the Ten Limbu Kings of Limbuwan and became their overlord. He died without any male heir and King Uba Hang took over as supreme ruler of Limbuwan in 849 AD- 865 AD. He made many religious and social reforms in Limbuwan. Uba Hang's worthy son Mabo Hang succeeded him in 865 AD and ruled till 880 AD. Uba hang kept on with the reforms his father had started. Uba Hang was succeeded by his son Muda Hang. Muda Hang was a weak ruler so the local chiefs started ruling their areas independently. Muda Hang was succeeded by his son Wedo Hang, by this time Limbuwan was in chaos and every principality was ruling independently and fighting with each other. King Wedo hang was murdered and his son Chemjonghang succeeded. Rise of King Sirijonga He subdued all the independent rulers and took over as the new supreme ruler of Limbuwan. He built two big forts in Phedap (present day Terhathum district) and Chainpur (present day Sankhuwasabha district). The remains of the structure still stand today. One of legacy was that he brought all the Limbus under the same writing system in Limbu script. He also brought feudal reform in Limbuwan and divided Limbuwan into new boundaries and districts. Eventually after the establishment of Namgyal dynasty in Sikkim and under the Lho-Mehn-Tsong Tsum, a treaty between the Bhutia, Lepcha and Limbu people of the Sikkim area, Limbuwan lost the area between Kunchenjunga range (present day eastern border of Nepal) and Teesta River to the Bhutia Kings of Sikkim. Since then Limbuwan comprises all the area between Arun River and Koshi River in the west to Kunchenjunga Mountains and Mechi River in the east. In the beginning of the 15th century, the descendants of King Sirijonga became weak and Limbuwan again fell into chaos and anarchy. At the time Lowland Limbuwan Kingdom of Morang was ruled by King Sangla Ing. Sangla Ing declared independence and became the first independent ruler of Morang in a century. His son Pungla Ing adopted Hinduism and changed his name into Aamar Raya Ing. He was succeeded by his descendants, who also bore Hindu names. Kirti Narayan Raya Ing, Aap Narayan Raya Ing, Jarai Narayan Raya Ing, Ding Narayan Raya Ing, and Bijay Narayan Raya Ing. King Bijay Narayan Raya Sanlga Ing built a new town in the middle of Varatappa and Shangori fort and named it Bijaypur after him. He had no issue and died without an heir. Bijaypur town was founded in 1584 AD and is currently located next to Dharan, Sunsari District. Bijaypur town remained the capital of Morang Kingdom and Limbuwan region until the Gorkha Limbuwan War in 1774 AD. It was the most powerful and influential of all the Kingdoms in Limbuwan region and was able to establish its hegemony among all the other Limbu rulers. But in 1609 AD Kirant King Lo hang Sen of Sen dynasty captured Morang and ruled it for seven generations. King of Phedap Murray Hang was made the chief minister of Morong. He stayed in Bijaypur and the King of Morong made his post hereditary. Murray Hang was given a Hindu name and he became Bidya Chandra Raya . His descendants remained Chief Ministers of Morong until Buddhi Karna Raya . Buddhi Karna Raya succeeded the last Sen King of Morang Kama Datta sen and sat in the throne of Bijaypur Palace in 1769 AD.

The judges were again Raymond Blanc, Sarah Willingham and David Moore. Nine couples competed for the chance to open their own restaurant, this time backed by all three judges. Filming for the third series, which is based in Bristol, began on 12 June. In what were apparently cost-cutting measures, the format was changed from previous series. There was only one episode each week, no challenge, and the restaurants were not allocated until the third week. Only six couples were given a restaurant to run. In a departure from the previous series there was much less emphasis on cooking skills, or actual performance during the series with a greater focus on the couples' concepts for their restaurants, as shown by JJ and James's win despite the former's lack of cooking skills and abysmal performance in the majority of tasks. The Restaurant was made by BBC Vision Productions. In July 2010 the BBC announced that the show has ended. Contestants * JJ Goodman and James Hopkins (1st), partners in life, business parthers and the winkers in The London Cocktail Club in Covent Garden, from London. * Chris Hackett and Nathan Gooding (2nd), from Kent and London. * Rebecca and Stephen (3rd), a married couple from London. * Daisy and Nadine (4th), from Herefordshire and London. * Barney and Badger (5th), two former soldiers from Essex and Kent. * Frances and Lucy (6th), former Cheltenham Ladies' College pupils. * Janet and Sean Duffy (7th), florists from Windsor, were eliminated without being given a restaurant. * Sarah and Joe (8th), a mother and son team from Devon, were eliminated without being given a restaurant. * Natalie and Sandy (9th), a mother and daughter team from Yorkshire, were eliminated without being given a restaurant, on safety grounds. Episodes Week One *Task: The Pitch ‚Äî In 3 groups of three, create a signature dish that was either a starter, main or dessert for their restaurant. While presenting their dish to the judges they also had to pitch their concept for a restaurant. *Eliminated: *::Natalie and Sandy were eliminated mid-show for dangerous use of knives, lack of organisation, and a mousse that failed to set. *::Sarah and Joe were eliminated at the end of the show for not having a clear vision for their restaurant, despite Sarah cooking one of the better dishes of all the contestants. Week Two *Task: The Chain ‚Äî The seven couples left in the competition must run three leading chain restaurants in Bristol. ::*Pizza Express at Harbourside : Janet and Sean, Daisy and Nadine; ::*Yo Sushi at Cabot Circus : Barney and Badger, Frances and Lucy, Rebecca and Stephen; and ::*Tampopo at Cabot Circus : Chris and Nathan, JJ and James. *Eliminated: Janet and Sean were eliminated for falling behind so far in evening service that they closed without having served a large proportion of the customers seated in their restaurant. Week Three *Task: Opening Night ‚Äî the remaining couples are given their restaurants and must demonstrate their concepts. *Restaurants Drawn: ::* Barney and Badger - Barrington & Badger's at The Muset on Clifton Road in Clifton. ::* Chris and Nathan - Rags to Riches at the Walrus and Carpenter on Hensman's Hill. ::* Daisy and Nadine - D'Soiree at the site of One30 on Cheltenham Road in Stokes Croft. ::* JJ and James - The Summer House on the site of the former Deasons on Whiteladies Road. ::* Frances and Lucy - The Cheeky Pig at The Olive Shed on Princes Wharf. ::* Rebecca and Stephen - The Front Room at the former Howards Restaurant on Avon Crescent. *Restaurant of the week: Barney and Badger - Barrington & Badger's *Eliminated: Frances and Lucy were eliminated because the judges felt they did not possess the skills to successfully run a restaurant and were unlikely to develop them over the remaining weeks of the competition; \\"I felt ‚Äî it was too much for you,too much too take on, too much to learn, that the industry is too tough for you; you're not prepared yet ‚Äî I wish you all the best.\\" said Blanc. Week Four *Task: The Seasonal Ingredient ‚Äî The five remaining couples must make dishes to sell at a local farmers market using only fresh, local and seasonal produce. Their dishes must showcase the best produce and promote their restaurant concepts. They were then delivered gifts of freshly caught rabbit and pigeon with which to create dishes for their restaurants. *Restaurant of the week: Rebecca and Stephen - The Front Room *Eliminated: Barney and Badger did not attend the farmer's market challenge. In reviewing this with Blanc, Badger effectively quit when he admitted that he was \\"not going to be able to give 100%\\". \\"Their service was excellent, and their monition present; but the problem is they want different things ‚Äî so I closed their restaurant\\" said Blanc. Week Five *Task: The Cake ‚Äî During a heatwave in Bristol, the four remaining couples serve afternoon tea to over 130 guests at a tea dance. They then had to run a function for high-profile guests with exacting specifications, including a cake, as well as their normal service. *Restaurant of the week: none *Eliminated: Daisy and Nadine, as Blanc felt that their concept had been lost. Week Six *Task: The Singles ‚Äî The remaining couples offer a romantic takeaway dinner for two, followed by a singles night. *Restaurant of the week: none *Eliminated: none Week Seven *Task: The Demo ‚Äî The three remaining couples must stage a cookery masterclass in their restaurants. *Restaurant of the week: none *Eliminated: Rebecca and Stephen ‚Äî The judges felt that they would not be reliable partners under the pressure of business.

The falls are accessible via the National Pass Walking Trail and the Overcliff/Undercliff Walk. The total height of the waterfall is . Features and description Near the falls, there is a rocky knoll that has a large number of grinding grooves created by rubbing stone implements on the rock to shape and sharpen them. These marks have been determined to be signs of early human habitation nearby. In February 2013, following a period of high rainfall, the Wentworth Falls was reported as looking \\"spectacular\\" with torrents of water flowing. Incidents and accidents 27-year-old Paul Marshall, an English tourist from Leicester, fell 76 metres (250 ft) off the waterfall and died while paddling in a rock pool in December 2000. Another English tourist, 20-year-old Josh Furber from Runcorn, slipped on rocks and died in January 2013 after falling 100 metres (330 ft) off the waterfall. Access A picnic area, accessible via a sealed road from the Great Western Highway, is located a short distance from the town of Wentworth Falls, with parking for cars and larger vehicles. A view of the top of the falls is easily accessible from the Wentworth Falls Lookout which is accessed by a slightly sloping concrete path (wheelchair accessible) from the car park area. Stop first at the Jamison Lookout for views over the Jamison Valley. There are two access points which lead down well-formed steps to Princes Lookout from where you can see most of the first two sections of the falls before they disappear into the valley below. A good way to do this walk to Princes Lookout is to walk out to the Wentworth Falls Lookout and then take the steps leading down to the falls, about an eight-minute walk. When returning take the left fork when you come to the meeting of two stairways, this will bring you back to the main pathway at the top near the Jamison Lookout. Other easy and challenging walking trails loop from the picnic area and follow the Jamison Creek south to the top of Wentworth Falls where scenic views over the expansive Jamison Valley to the south can be enjoyed. A trail follows the creek as it cascades down several waterfalls; with a further trail leading down into the valley floor.  Arriving by train Accessed via the Blue Mountains Line from the Wentworth Falls railway station, the easiest way to reach the Blue Mountains National Park is to walk the Charles Darwin Walk. This walk follows Jamison Creek along a track that provides access to waterfalls and birdwatching. The walk is one way (45 minutes to one hour and 15 minutes) and starts from Wilson Park (10 minutes from the railway station).

The Phone itself also has a 4 GB SanDisk Class 2 microSD Card (SDHC) inside. The T-Mobile myTouch 3G Fender LE comes with the same accessories except for the headphone adapter, and the microSD card that is included has a 16 GB capacity.  Vodafone  The Vodafone HTC Magic comes bundled with a pair of headphones, wall charger, USB cable and documentation. The phone comes with a 2 GB microSD card.

Unlike the T-Mobile model, it does not come with an extUSB headphone adapter. The HTC Magic was one of the first smartphones to be offered by Rogers.  Software stack  HTC Magic runs the Android operating system and comes pre-installed with a WebKit-based browser. Other pre-installed software enables access to various Google services, including Gmail, Google search, Google Maps, Google Talk and YouTube. Like in HTC Dream, the Android Market application, which allows users to download new software applications from third-party developers, as well as providing publicly viewable ratings and comments, is also included with the device. Versions of HTC Magic for the Indian market do not have Google apps and Android Market access.Indian version of HTC Magic lacks Google apps and Market access.HTC Magic (Indian version) - expectations and facts There also are several non-official versions of Android released for the Magic, such as CyanogenMod firmware, which offers enhanced performance and additional features.  Software upgrades  Most carriers have upgraded this phone to Android OS 2.2 Froyo, including T-Mobile and Vodafone. One exception is Rogers in Canada which has not upgraded the phone past Android 2.1, and NTT Docomo in Japan, which has not upgraded the phone past Android 1.6. Another is Proximus in Belgium and HTC in Taiwan, which has released no updates to the Android 1.5 firmware.  Hardware  * Two different hardware platforms exist for this phone; they need different boot images and wireless LAN kernel modules: **The PVT32A, with a Qualcomm MSM7200A ARM11 processor, and 288 MB RAM. **The PVT32B, with a Qualcomm MSM7201A ARM11 processor, and 192 MB RAM. The only models that use the 32B platform are the original T-Mobile myTouch 3G (v1.2 of this phone, released in Feb 2010, switched to the 32A), the Vodafone Magic in some countries, the Google Ion developer phone, and the NTT DoCoMo HT-03A. * Three different 3G radio configurations exist for this phone (listed in the order in which they were released): **The T-Mobile and Google models support AWS (band IV) and IMT (band I), so they are compatible with the 3G networks of T-Mobile and WIND Canada, and some carriers in Europe and Asia. **The 'world' version of this phone supports IMT (band I) and GSM (band VIII), so it is compatible with 3G networks in Europe, Asia, and Brazil. **The Rogers Canada version of this phone support PCS (band II) and CLR (band V) so it is compatible with the 3G networks of AT&T; in the U.S., and with Rogers, Fido (Rogers), Bell, and Telus in Canada. (All of these support the same four standard 2G GSM frequencies, so they can be used without 3G on most GSM networks anywhere in the world.) *The PVT32B HTC Magic lacks a 3.5mm TRS jack for headphones and requires an adapter - this was sometimes bundled with the phone. *Some PVT32A models (such as the Fender T-Mobile myTouch 3G and the T-Mobile myTouch 3G 1.2 in the US) added a built-in headphone jack on top of the phone. *This phone has a hearing aid compatibility rating of M4. * Display: 3.2 inch (8.1 cm) thin-film transistor (TFT) LCD flat glass touch- sensitive HVGA screen with 480 X 320 pixel resolution. The capacitive touchscreen makes it impossible to use a standard stylus. Users can interact to display or move content with a finger touch, tapping or touch-drag motion. The touchscreen hardware is capable of multitouch gestures, but until more recently, official releases of Android (v1.0 to v1.6) available for the Magic had this functionality disabled at the kernel level. Users had to patch the supplied version of Android or download a hacked version or update to Android 2.0 or later to make use of the multi-touch screen. However, an upgrade to Android 2.2 is now officially available. * CPU: The MSM7200A (PVT32A) or MSM7201A (PVT32B) is an ARM-based, dual-core CPU/GPU from Qualcomm and contains many built-in features, including 3G and a GPU capable of up to 4 million triangles/sec. It has hardware acceleration for Java, but this does not accelerate execution of Android applications, as they are targeted to the Dalvik virtual machine, not the Java virtual machine. * Keyboard The HTC Magic does not have a physical keyboard. Text input is done through an on-screen keyboard. The keyboard can be set to provide haptic and sound feedback when keys are pressed. The HTC Magic has a built in accelerometer which rotates the keyboard between portrait and landscape view automatically based on the orientation of the phone. The HTC Magic also has a number of physical back-lit buttons: **Send (green): Launches the dialer to call a number, or accepts an incoming call, or hold to launch the voice dialer. **Home: Returns to the android home screen, or hold to open up a list of recently used applications. **Menu: Opens up the menu of the active application, or hold to open up the keyboard. **Back: Exits out of the keyboard, or returns to the prior application, or prior page in the web browser. **Search: Launches a search function in the active application, or hold to launch voice search. **End (red): Ends a call if there is a call currently active, or puts the phone into sleep mode, or hold to power off the phone. **Trackball: Backlit Trackball navigates between menus or scroll through a line of text, press down to select the highlighted item. ** The HTC Magic also has an LED indicator which flashes for missed calls, text messages, or lights up orange when charging, or green when charging is 90% or higher. There is also a Volume Rocker on the left side of the phone. There is no physical dedicated camera button. * Camera: The HTC Magic has a 3.2-megapixel camera with autofocus functionality. * Video: The HTC Magic can play H.264, streaming, 3GPP, MPEG4, and 3GP files. There is no light (\\"flash\\") for the camera in low light conditions. Video recording and uploading to YouTube is available as of Android 1.5, recording resolution 352x288 H.263 3GP, mono sound @ 8 kHz. * Storage: The HTC Magic has a microSD card slot. It has been confirmed to work with capacities up to 16 GB, and may work with larger cards. When the USB cable is connected to a computer, this computer can access the card without removing it from the HTC Magic. The phone can access media files arranged in folders, but the folders must be created from a third-party file management application or from a computer. * Battery: The HTC Magic has a user-replaceable, 3.7V, 1340mAh rechargeable lithium ion battery, which is advertised to offer up to 600 hours of standby power. * Location: The HTC Magic has a built in GPS receiver for location functionality including free turn-by-turn GPS (Google Maps Navigation, originally only in the United States, now also available in the United Kingdom). It can also use cell towers and wifi hotspots to help determine its location. The HTC Magic has a built in digital Compass to help determine its orientation. * Case: Three different colors are available for the myTouch 3G: Black (Gray Trim), Merlot (Black Trim), and White (Silver Trim). The Google Ion version of the HTC Magic is black with a dark blue trim and silver buttons. The Vodafone HTC Magic is white with a silver trim. * Connectivity: The HTC Magic supports WiFi, 3G UMTS and HSPA, EDGE, and GPRS networks. The myTouch 3G supports AT&T;'s network, but only on 2G/EDGE.  Successors marketed by T-Mobile USA  T-Mobile USA released the myTouch 3G Slide June 2, 2010 in the United States. The myTouch 3G Slide runs Android 2.2 Froyo and has a 3.4-inch touch screen and a 5-megapixel auto focus camera with LED flash. T-Mobile USA released the myTouch 4G November 3, 2010 in the United States. The myTouch 4G runs Android 2.2 Froyo. The myTouch4G features a 3.8-inch touch screen, a 5-megapixel auto-focus rear camera with LED flash, a front-facing VGA camera for video chat and can be used as a Wi-Fi Hotspot for up to 4 devices. The myTouch 4G supports T-Mobile's 4G HSPA+ network.

The Kalpasar Project envisages building a 30 km dam across the Gulf of Khambat in India for establishing a huge fresh water coastal reservoir for irrigation, drinking and industrial purposes. The project with 30 km sea dam will have the capacity to store 10,000 million cubic meters fresh water, equating to 25% of Gujarat‚Äôs average annual rainwater flow, from the rivers of Saurashtra region namely Narmada, Mahi, Dhadhar, Sabarmati, Limbdi-Bhagovo, and two other minor rivers. A 10 lane road link will also be set up over the dam, greatly reducing the distance between Saurashtra and South Gujarat. The project, which will create world's largest freshwater lake in marine environment, will cost INR90,000 crore or US$12.75 billion (2015-16 estimates with 8% annual inflation) excluding the cost of tidal power plant. Project entails construction of the main \\"Kalpasar dam\\" across Gulf of Khambat and another Bhadbhut barrage on Narmada river, as well as a canal connecting the two. Spending began in earnest in 2004, and by 2018 INR 250 crore has been spent on various feasibility studies and surveys. By July 2019, 25 of the 43 feasibility studies for the ecological, environmental, social and financial impact, etc were complete; 8 more were underway; remaining 10 surveys will take 3 to 5 years to complete i.e. by 2021-23. Detailed Project Report (DPR) was intended to be completed by the end of 2018. The project, if found feasible, will take at least 20 years (by 2035-38) to complete including 3 to 5 years pre-construction feasibility studies which are presently underway, and further 12 to 15 years of construction thereafter which has not commenced yet. As of 2018, no environmental or other clearances have been obtained for the Kalpasar dam. Meanwhile the construction of the Bhadhut barrage, which is a smaller component of the project, will commence from 2020. More than 30,000 MCM of water from Narmada river alone flows out annually into the sea due to the lack of storage capacity and dams, thus experts have been calling for a review of Gujarat's Water Policy to expedite the Kalpasar project. Background  Etymology  Kalpasar means a lake that fulfills all the wishes (‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™+‡§∏‡§∞). The construction of the word is similar to ‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡§µ‡•É‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑, the Hindu mythological ‚ÄòKalpa Vriksha‚Äô (Devanagari: ‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡§µ‡•É‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑) ‚Äì wishing tree. History The Gulf of Khambhat was identified as a promising site for tidal power generation by UNDP Expert, Mr. Eric Wilson in the year 1975. Successive governments were then presented in details the possibility of a project, aptly named Kalpasar Project by its visionary Dr. Anil Kane, who conceptualised it in 80s as a feasible project. In 1988‚Äì89 a reconnaissance report was prepared for the dam across the Gulf of Khambhat. The report concluded that, assuming sound foundation conditions, the closure of the Gulf was technically feasible. Studies are still going on and the length of the proposed dam is reduced and the tidal power component is dropped. The cost of project is estimated at 90,000 crore (as of 2017). It is reported that the project may take 20 years to complete if found feasible and approved.  Project details   Objectives  Kalpasar aims at the creation of a fresh water coastal reservoir in the Gulf of Khambhat by the construction of a dam connecting the east and west bank of the Gulf. In the reservoir the runoff from Sabarmati, Mahi, Dhadar and Narmada will be stored, together with the waters from the Saurashtra rivers discharging into the Gulf of Khambhat. The stored waters are to be used for irrigation, domestic and industrial water requirements in the Saurashtra region. Kalpasar is considered the evident solution for solving on the short as well as on the long term the threatening drinking and irrigation water problems in Saurashtra. Once the Gulf is closed, water levels within the reservoir can be controlled while the tidal fluctuation outside the reservoir continues and, hence, can be harnessed for the generation of tidal energy. In addition to fresh water storage and tidal power generation, Kalpasar also aims at land reclamation, transportation improvements and fisheries development. In accordance with this project, a mega fresh water reservoir will be constructed on the upstream side of the dam by impounding the surplus waters of numerous rivers. This project, will resolve four vital problems of the State of Gujarat which are water, electrical power, road-rail transport and development of ports. Scope and cost =Abandoned original plan and scope= Map of old proposal scope with larger 64 km long Kalpasar dam and tidal power plant, no longer valid. The original plan envisaged a larger dam along with a tidal power plant. A state government release said the Rs 55,000 crore (US$11.7 billion) project, to be completed by 2020, will have a vast fresh water reservoir with gross storage of 16,791 million cubic metres of water, 64 km long dam across the Gulf of Khambhat connecting Ghogha in Bhavnagar with Hansot in Bharuch District, reducing the distance between the two by 225 km. It will have tidal power generation house with an installed capacity of 5,880 MW. Another estimate was given by the Government in October 2010 which stated the proposed dam to be built just north of Bhavnagar in the west to Alandar in Dahej on the east. In 2017, the revised project plan reduced the size of lake with only 30 km sea dam instead of original plan of 64 km long dam. = Revised and reduced current scope = Map of the new and revised scope of the proposed project with newly proposed 1.7 km long Bhadbhut barrage, a smaller 30 km long Kalpasar dam, and tidal power plant descoped/dropped. In 2017 the scope and size of the dam project was reduced, instead of a longer Kalpasar dam across the Gulf of, it will now have a shorter Kalpasar dam across the Gulf of Khambat along with another Bhadbhut barrage on Narmada river and a canal connecting these two. The Tidal power project has been dropped from the scope, which could be taken up as a separate project. * Kalpasar dam: The size of Kalpasar dam has been reduced by shifting the alignment towards north, from Kala Talav village in Bhavnagar district to Aladar village north of Port of Dahej in Bharuch district. * Bhadbhut barrage: Since the alignment of \\"Kalpasar dam\\" has been moved further north, the Narmada river will not flow directly into the Kalpasar dam. Instead Narmada's water will be diverted to Kalpasar dam by constructing another 1.7 km long causeway-cum-weir barrage of 600 million cubic meter storage capacity 25 km upstream of Narmada's mouth before it enters the sea near Bhadbhut in Bharuch district.Gujarat protests waterway body‚Äôs plan to repurpose Badhbhut barrage, Times of India, 11 February 2019.‚ÄòBhadbhut barrage only solution to salinity ingress in Narmada, Times of India, 22 April 2018. This barrage help prevent saltwater intrusion in Narmada river. * Bhadbhut-Kalpasar canal: To transfer the water of narmada river from \\"Bhadbhut barrage\\" to \\"Kalpasar dam\\", a new 30 km long canal with one lac cusecs watr carrying capacity will be constructed from \\"Bhadbhut barrage\\" to \\"Kalpasar dam\\". * Kalpasar irrigation command and channels: Various canals and channels will be built in the Saurashtra to irrigate the farms from \\"Kalpasar dam\\".Current/new alignment map  Issues  Narmada river one of the 111 waterways in India which facilitate the water transport in India, the currently design of Bhadhut barrage by the Gujarat government would allow only lower capacity class III ships where as the union water transport ministry notification envisages higher capacity class IV ships, consequently union government has asked Gujarat government to upgrade the design of the barrage and shipping locks to facilitate the navigation of larger class IV ships. There are other ecological and environmental issues to be addressed as part of various feasibility studies being undertaken.

The reservoir is located on a granite plateau approximately above sea level, and consists of a body of water with a capacity of . This water supplies the domestic drinking water for the city of Colorado Springs, and because of this fact, access to the area was briefly limited after the September 11 attacks on the United States. The area today is a popular recreation area for boaters, mountain bikers, and hikers. Planning for construction of the reservoir began in the 1960s in recognition of the growing population of south-central Colorado and its increasing need for drinking water. In 1967, the city of Colorado Springs voted that the planned reservoir would eventually be opened for public recreation after construction of the necessary facilities. In 1969, the reservoir's dam was built, stretching long and high. Five years after its completion, the dam was completely filled and opened to the public as a recreation area. The reservoir has been stocked with fish by the Colorado Division of Wildlife, which continues to do so today. Rampart Reservoir closed on June 23, 2012 due to the Waldo Canyon fire. The reservoir was reopened for limited access (no boats) on Friday, May 24, 2013. The Rampart Range Reservoir in Pike National forest offers fabulous views of Pikes Peak and other surrounding mountain ranges. The water is pristine and visibility to the bottom is crystal clear. The fishing is typically excellent with many species of trout including record size Lake trout. After many years of drought conditions and the devastating Waldo Canyon Fire, the lake is again filled to capacity as of 2015. Camping and camp fires are not allowed in the reservoir area and shore. Only electric or unpowered water craft are allowed. The wildlife to be seen include bears, mountain lions, snowshoe hares, and eagles which can almost always be viewed. There is no swimming allowed. The City of Colorado Springs manages the dam and the access to the north dam shore and has started to deny access to the north shore and is currently in the initial stages of a class action lawsuit by fishermen, boaters, hikers, and bicyclists who wish to use the area. The dry land encompassing the lake is Pike National Forest and open to public access 24 hours a day and seven days a week. There is excellent snow-shoe hiking on numerous trails throughout the region. Always beware of rapidly changing weather conditions around the reservoir and surrounding skies. The weather can change to rain, hail, low temperatures, extremely dangerous lightning, and even tornados in one hour from a clear blue sky.

He was also charged with being a member of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), an Islamic terrorist organization. All these allegations were proven wrong. He was arrested in February 2009 along with five others, charged with these crimes and prosecuted, but was acquitted after being given benefit of doubt. The late Shahid Azmi was his lawyer and fought his case pro bono. Faheem Ansari was discharged by court in May 2010, a few months after Shahid Azmi's death by gunmen in February 2010.He was released after 12 years of detention because of a case, in which he was acquitted because of lack of evidence. Background Ansari's family was originally from Uttar Pradesh, but he was born and raised in Mumbai. He is married to Yasmin, with whom he has a daughter, Iqra. He joined the Lashkar e Toiba in 2003 while working in Dubai. In 2007, he returned to Mumbai and stayed there for about three months. Though his parents and brothers were residing in the Goregaon suburb of the city, he made no attempt to contact them during his entire stay. He first stayed at a guest house in Grant Road, but after a few weeks rented a small accommodation. Ansari had initially planned on renting an accommodation in Colaba, but due to the high rent there, decided to settle at Grant Road. The Mumbai police alleged that Ansari did a reconnaissance of several prominent Mumbai landmarks, including the Mumbai Stock Exchange, the Mumbai police headquarters at Crawford Market, the Maharashtra police headquarters at Colaba, the Mahalakshmi Temple and the Siddhivinayak temple. Ansari went to the Taj Hotel and Oberoi Trident as a tourist and shot video footage of the interiors. He also videotaped the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Nariman House, and hand-drew the maps of all the 26/11 targets. In December 2007, Ansari travelled to Kathmandu, where he met and handed over the material to his associate, Sabahuddin Shaikh. He then travelled on a Pakistani passport to Karachi and gave the maps to an LET member named Muzammil. Arrest On 10 February 2008, Uttar Pradesh police arrested Ansari along with five others. These included Pakistani nationals Romez alias \\"Amar Singh\\" and Sehwez alias \\"Ajay Malhotra\\" and Indian nationals Sohel, Sawauddin (or Sabauddin) Sanju and Baba Jung Bahadur. He was arrested for his involvement with an attack on a Central Reserve Police Force camp in Rampur on 31 December 2007, in which 7 paramilitary personnel and 1 civilian were killed. The interrogation revealed that Ansari had performed reconnaissance over twelve places in Mumbai, including government, police, transportation, tourist and financial sites over the course of two months. However, Ansari later alleged that the Mumbai police conveniently made him a scapegoat and deliberately falsified evidence against him. Alleged role in the Mumbai attacks and acquittal On 31 December 2008, Ansari, along with Sabauddin Shaikh, was formally accused of aiding the November 2008 attackers in Mumbai. The interrogation of Ajmal Kasab and of Ansari, revealed that none of the attackers had been in the city before the attacks, and acted solely on intelligence provided by Ansari. On 11 February 2010, his lawyer Shahid Azmi was murdered in what was suspected by authorities to be a professional contract killing. On 3 May 2010, Ansari and the co- accused Sabauddin Shaikh were acquitted of any complicity in the attacks. In the acquittal, the Judge blasted the Mumbai police for the case it made against him and Sabauddin Shaikh. They were shifted from Arthur Road Jail to Uttar Pradesh to stand trial in connection with the CRPF camp attack at Rampur in 2007. Sexual harassment Advocate Ejaz Naqvi, the lawyer for Ansari, presented in court an allegation that a female FBI agent had removed all of Ansari's clothes and showed him pornographic films. Naqvi also requested that Ansari be taken for a medical examination. The court asked the Crime Branch to investigate and report by 26 February 2009, and ordered the medical examination. Ansari had earlier questioned the right of FBI agents to interrogate him. See also Citations fahim anvar attack mumbai- boss groups References *.

In February 1977 the Lower Saxony cabinet designated finally the Gorleben salt dome as a single location for the repository and waste disposal center. The choice of Gorleben was the work of a project group which investigated 140 salt domes within a few months. Of these 140 salt domes only four were proposed: Lichtenhorst, Wahn, Maria Gl√ºck (H√∂fer) and Gorleben. Of these, Gorleben was chosen. The selection criteria were among others, land use, population density, radiation and repository geology. Geoscientific arguments played only a small role. For example, the salt dome H√∂fer (Maria Gl√ºck) is too small for a repository but reached the last round of selection. The ultimate decision for Gorleben according to the former Lower Saxony Prime Minister Ernst Albrecht was mainly for structural reasons for the economic development of the zone.Albrecht, E.:Interview mit dem nieders√§chsischen Ministerpr√§sidenten Ernst Albrecht √ºber Atomstrom, Wiederaufarbeitung und Entsorgung.- Bonner Energie-Report, 4. Jg, Nr. 10 vom 6. Juni 1983, S. 18-21, Bonn. 1.5 billion Euro's of research has been conducted in the period 1979-2000 at Gorleben.Where Should Germany Store Its Nuclear Waste? On hindsight it became clear that the original and methodologically correct approach, to investigate three potentially suitable salt domes in parallel and a comparative assessment of the results were abandoned by the choice for Gorleben. Security-oriented geoscientific arguments were ignored in the evaluation of Gorleben.Albrecht, I. et al.: Studie zur Entwicklung von Grundlagen f√ºr ein Verfahren zur Auswahl von Endlagerstandorten und Beurteilung ihrer Langzeitsicherheit, Abschlussbericht, im Auftrag des Nieders√§chsischen Umweltministeriums, November 1994, Hannover The lack of transparency and accountability for the decision for Gorleben is still one of the reasons why the opposition to the location is so vehement. Surface exploration The surface exploration of the Gorleben site began in April 1979 and lasted until 1983. The investigation covered drilling 44 boreholes in the salt table, geophysical investigations, including reflection seismic measurements, hydro-geological studies, approximately 500 outcrop- and groundwaterlevel drillings, four deep boreholes to approximately at the edges of the salt stock, two shaft boreholes to approximately depth to confirm the starting points of the selected slot, a seismic networkstation to monitor earthquake activity as well as numerous other studies. The exploration results and their evaluation were carried out in two reports by the Physikalisch- Technische Bundesanstalt (1983) and the Bundesamt f√ºr Strahlenschutz (1990) and are summarized below. It says (PTB 1983): \\"An initial assessment of the capping mass in terms of its barrier function for potential contaminated ground water shows that the occurring clay sediments in the central areas of the salt stock Gorleben lack the indication that it can function as a permanent barrier to prevent contamination of the biosphere.Physikalisch- Technische Bundesanstalt: Zusammenfassender Zwischenbericht √ºber bisherige Ergebnisse der Standortuntersuchung in Gorleben. Mai 1983, Braunschweig.\\" This assessment still applies today and is supplemented by other negative site characteristics, such as anticipatory selective subrosion and the short time that is needed for the groundwater from the salt dome to reach the biosphere. The expectations that one of the capping masses could be used as a barrier were not fulfilled.Appel, D. & Kreusch, J.: Das Mehrbarrierensystem bei der Endlagerung radioaktiver Abf√§lle in einem Salzstock. Studie im Auftrag von Greenpeace e.V. Deutschland, 2006, Hannover. After that there was a change in safety philosophy: the importance of the capping mass as a barrier against the spread of radionuclides has been withdrawn and in return the salt dome alone is used as the crucial barrier. Based on this modification of the safety philosophy the underground exploration started. Underground exploration The drilling for shaft 1 started in 1986 and in October 1996 the punch line was created between shafts 1 and 2 on the sole. The main objective of the underground exploration is the detection of rocksalts like top anhydrite which are required for the final storage. The exploration area 1 is largely open and under investigation. Comprehensive geoscientific investigations as well as geotechnical measurements and experiments were done. The results so far can be classified according to the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR 1998) as follows: * In the border zone between the core and the southern salt dome flank are heavily deformed layers and their thickness is reduced. Areas of missing top anhydrite and accompanying layers. The top anhydrite is decomposed into individual plates. Larger isolated solutions and gas reserves are possible in the top anhydrite layers. * Between the core zone and the northern salt dome flank the border zones are laid in folds, and the layers involved are still largely in its original sedimentary form. The topanhydrite is broken, but not decomposed into individual layers. *Core zone of the salt stocks with top salt: Here is a simple solution without solutions and gas reserves. * In the boreholes located in areas near the border area of Zechstein 2/Zechstein 3 intensive folding of the layers with high reduction of thickness occurs. In the border region Sta√üfurt to Zechstein 3 are partially disorders healed by secondary rock salts. Limited solution and gas can occur in the disturbed areas but without connections to the salt levels. The Gorleben moratorium In the agreement between the federal government and electric utility companies on June 14, 2000 in addition to the nuclear power phase-out a moratorium on the planned repository Gorleben was agreed on. After the agreement the exploration of Gorleben to clarify conceptual and safety issues was suspended for at least three years with a maximum of ten years.

Focus is placed on machine learning control and model-based nonlinear control using reduced-order modelling and nonlinear (attractor) closures. Currently investigated configurations include wakes, mixing layers, jets, combustor mixing and aerodynamic flows around cars and airplanes. Another main area is thermodynamic formalisms for turbulence modeling. Life He received his degree as diplom physicist from the Georg-August- University, G√∂ttingen, in 1989. He stayed on to receive his physics doctorate in 1992 under Helmut Eckelmann. In the sequel, he had positions at the Max- Planck-Institut f√ºr Str√∂mungsforschung, G√∂ttingen, the German Aerospace Center, G√∂ttingen, the G√∂ttingen University, and the United Technologies Research Center (East Hartford, CT, USA) before he joined the Berlin Institute of Technology. There, Professor Noack has headed the group \\"Reduced-Order Modelling for Flow Control\\" at the School V \\"Transport and Machine Systems\\". Currently, he is Director of Research CNRS at Laboratoire d'Informatique pour la M√©canique et les Sciences de l'Ing√©nieur (LIMSI), Paris-Saclay, France and Professor at the Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig, Germany, Honorary Professor at the Berlin University of Technology and Visiting Professor at the Harbin Institute of Technology, China. Scientific work Focus of Noack's work are physical theories and mathematical methods for turbulence control. One direction is the development of control-oriented nonlinear models and associated control design building on the Galerkin method, originally proposed by Boris Galerkin. He proposed the first mathematical Galerkin model for the two- and three-dimensional cylinder wake from Hilbert space considerations. Subsequent works employ the proper orthogonal decomposition and propose numerous enablers accounting for the pressure term, subscale turbulence and departures from the training set. He has distilled three major facets of nonlinearity in dynamical least-order models: * The role of the base flow in saturation of fluctuation level building on J. T. Stuart's mean field theory and generalizing the Landau model for a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. * The interaction of two coherent structures at different frequencies via the base flow leading to coupled Landau oscillators. * A statistical closure for the energy cascade of broadband dynamics via a finite time non-equilibrium thermodynamics (FTT) framework. The associated control laws can be derived from energy considerations and have been applied to streamlined and bluff bodies. Recently, Noack works on implementing the powerful methods of machine learning in turbulence control. Major breakthroughs are learning the control law in real-world experiments with Machine learning control (MLC) and an automated learning the control-oriented dynamical gray-box model from experimental data. Supplementary projects include data visualization, phenomenological models, vortex models and entropy-based optimization in addition to a spectrum of model-free and model-based control approaches. The breadth of this research builds on a network of cross disciplinary collaborations at his affiliations in Paris-Saclay, Berlin, Braunschweig, Shenzhen and international teams.

One could swim (or in the winter walk over the ice) up to the buoys. Alexander Haus Alexander house stands on the north-western side of the lake. The home was constructed in 1927 by Dr. Alfred Alexander on land leased from Otto von Wollank, with the intention of building a weekend house. The home was photographed by Lotte Jacobi the following year. On the advent of World War II the family fled Nazi Germany in 1936 to England. From 1937-1952, the home was occupied by composter Will Meisel and actress Eliza Illiard. The first member of the Alexander family to return to the home was Dr. Afred's son, Hanns Alexander in 1946. Hanns was notable was capturing Rudolf H√∂ss. From 1952-2003, the K√ºhne and Fuhrmann families resided in the home.

The larval form (called chiggers) feeds on rodents, but also occasionally humans and other large mammals. They are related to the harvest mites of the North America and Europe. Originally, rodents were thought to be the main reservoir for O. tsutsugamushi and the mites were merely vectors of infection: that is, the mites only transferred the contagion from the rodents to humans. However, the mites are now known to only feed once in their lifetimes, which means that transmission from rodent to human via the mites is impossible (for it to have been possible, the mite would have to feed at least twice, once on the infected rodent and again on the human who would then be infected). Instead, the bacterium persists in the mites through transovarial transmission, where infected mites transmit the infection to their unborn offspring. Leptotrombidium mites are therefore both vector and reservoir for O. tsutsugamushi. The infection predominantly affects female mites, and does not appear to otherwise harm the mites.  Life history  The larvae are pale orange in colour and feed on liquified skin tissue, not blood, as their mouth parts (chelicerae) are too short to reach the blood vessels. They have three pairs of legs. The larvae most commonly target rodents, but also attach to humans. For humans, the bite is painless, but pain commonly develops only after the larvae detach from the skin, leaving red papules that may then develop into an eschar. The larval stage lasts for 1 to 2 weeks. After feeding, the larvae drop to the ground and become nymphs. Nymphs are brick-red in colour and have four pairs of legs. The nymphal stage lasts for 1 to 3 weeks. Nymphs mature into adults which have four pairs of legs, the first pair being the largest. They are harmless to humans. In the postlarval stage, they are not parasitic and feed on plant materials. Females lay eggs singly, which hatch in about a week. Lifespan of the adult is about 6 months. Taxonomy * L. akamushi is endemic to Japan and is the reservoir for the Kato serotype of O. tsutsugamushi; * L. deliense is the main vector in the south of China and in Thailand; it is also endemic to Litchfield Park, in the Northern Territory, Australia, where is carries the Litchfield serotype. * L. pallidum is endemic to Japan and is the reservoir for Karp and Gilliam serotypes; * L. scutellare is endemic to Japan and is the reservoir for Kawasaki and Kuroki serotypes.

They are considered by the government of Vietnam to be a subgroup of the Hmong people and therefore not one of the 54 recognized ethnicities in Vietnam. However, the Mieu reject this and see themselves as a distinct ethnicity. Origin and 'Loss of Country' According to Mieu folk songs (tu siv) the Mieu people descended from immigrants from southern China. They are said to have had their own kingdom in Liuzhou, near Guilin in Guangxi. They rose up in arms to the invasion, oppression, and exploitation they faced from the Manchus and Han Chinese. When a large force was sent to destroy this resistance, the Mieu fled to Vietnam. Language Like Hmong dialects, the Mieu language is also a member of Miao languages. It is officially classified as a Hmong dialect by Vietnamese linguists. However, they are neither intelligible with Hmong nor Xong, due to significant difference in vocabulary and accent. Their language might be a member of Hmu (Qiandong Miao, gheis Hmub - hveb Qeef dongb), most possibly the Southern Qiandong Miao [hms] language. The Mieu were mainly monolingual until around 1954. During this time they had little contact with other ethnic groups except for some Mieu men who went to markets. Especially since 1968, when many Mieu were resettled to foothills to practice wet rice cultivation, more of them became fluent in Tay. When the resources of the central state to reach out to mountainous areas and the ethnic minorities there increased, Vietnamese became more dominant. The Mieu do not have any writing system. The proposed Hmong script was rejected as not suitable for Mieu language. The Chinese Qiandong Miao Latin Alphabet might be suitable to them, which is based on Northern Qiandong Miao [hea]. Na Mieu is the sole non-Hmong Miao-speaking people outside China. Music Tu Siv, Mieu folk songs, are used to pass on knowledge of history. The most notable one is Siv Pax Quan (Loss of Country). It is sung during weddings, new year celebrations, when entering a new house, and so on.

He competed for Romania at the 1984, 1988, 1992 and 1996 Olympics and won a gold, a silver and a bronze medal. He won the world title in 1984, 1986 and 1990 and European title in 1985 and 1986 and set world records in the snatch in 1986 and 1993. Between 1991 and 1996, he lived in Australia and competed for it internationally. In 2006, he was elected member of the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame. Biography Vlad was born in a family of three brothers and one sister in a village of Piscu in Gala»õi County. His mother was a housewife and father worked for the national railway carrier CƒÉile Ferate Rom√¢ne; he did not do any particular sport, but was a strong man weighing 100 kg at 172 cm height. After completing a school in Gala»õi, Vlad moved to Bucharest. Between 1991 and 1996, Vlad lived in Australia and competed for it at the 1994 Commonwealth Games and two world championships during this time. In 1996, he returned to Romania, but still has strong ties to Australia visiting regularly as his two children continue to live there. Nicu is married to the former rower Cristina Vlad. Nicu took up weightlifting in 1978 and retired after the 1996 Olympics to become a national coach. In 2001, he was elected president of the Romanian Weightlifting Federation, and in 2004 vice president of the Romanian Olympic Committee. He also served as first vice president of the International Weightlifting Federation. Romanian deadlift Owing to Vlad, the flat-backed, semi-stiff legged barbell lift (with a form similar to a deadlift) came to be known as the Romanian deadlift. He was seen by some American lifters doing the deadlifts in the Olympic training hall prior to either winning a medal, setting a world record or both. Since he is Romanian, the exercise got dubbed the Romanian deadlift, and that is the name most people know the exercise by. As the exercise does not involve lifting the weight off the ground, it is not technically a deadlift, but rather a powerful compound accessory movement that strengthens the same muscles.

It was adapted from Lucy M. Boston's children's novel The Chimneys of Green Knowe (1958). The film was shot in Athelhampton Hall, Dorset. Plot Set in England, this ghostly, haunting story spans two worlds, over a century apart. Near the end of World War II, teen-aged Tolly (Alex Etel) goes to spend Christmas at his grandmother's large country estate, Green Knowe. Tolly's soldier father has been reported missing in action while his mother remains in London awaiting more information. His grandmother, Mrs. Oldknow (Maggie Smith), disapproved of her son's marriage, considering his wife a commoner. Mrs. Oldknow is financially strapped and faced with selling Green Knowe. On Tolly's first night at Green Knowe, he sees and hears a ghostly young girl and adolescent boy. Soon after, he discovers that he magically time travels between the present and the early 19th century in the old manor house. Certain people in that time period can see and communicate with him, while he remains invisible to others. Susan, the blind daughter of Lord Thomas Oldknow, is the ghostly figure that Tolly first saw. She can speak to Tolly both in her time and his. He learns that his grandmother also sees the ancestral ghosts. Susan leads him on an adventure that unlocks family secrets laid buried for generations. Exciting events include a terrible fire, a tale of stolen jewels, and threats of a servant being sold into a press gang. Although Green Knowe is saved, Tolly's father is a casualty of the war. Mrs. Oldknow finally welcomes Tolly's mother into the family. Tolly is comforted when his father's ghost appears, assuring him everything will be all right.

It lies within the county of Vorpommern-R√ºgen in the state of Mecklenburg- Vorpommern. It has an elevation of 1.1 metres above sea level and its surface area is 1.18 km¬≤. It is part of the Schmachter See and Fangerien Nature Reserve. View from the promenade The lake has its origins in the Ice Age. At the end of the glacial period there was an ice front here. Today the lake has an area of about 118 hectares. Before about 14,000 years ago the lake, which was then still part of the Baltic Sea, had a depth of up to 15 metres. About 5,000 years ago the waterbody was cut off from the Baltic by the bar of the Schmale Heide. Its only link to the Baltic is the drainage ditch of the Ahlbeck stream. As a result of natural silting-up processes it is today a shallow lake. In the centre it has a depth of only one to two metres. In addition the lake has lost a lot of its former area. Originally it purportedly reached as far south as Nistelitz. The name of the lake comes from the settlement of Schmacht to the southwest, but which no longer lies on the lake shore. The Ahlbeck, which drains the lake into the Baltic Sea, was canalised in the 1950s. The mouth of the pipe or ditch is located on the beach of Binzer Strand and is marked by an information sign. A variety of animal and plant species live on the lake and, including 40 species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. For example, the bittern reed warbler greylag goose, goosander, smew white-tailed eagle and osprey occur here. The shores of the lake are mainly covered in beech woods. At the foot of the slopes are seepage springs. Close to the lake are alder carrs and marshes. The shore itself is mainly fringed by reeds and quaking bog vegetation. At the northern end the lake is the village of Binz. Here, there is a promenade and the \\"Park of Senses\\" (Park der Sinne).  Restoration project  Southern shore For many years effluents were discharged into the lake from a since-closed sewage farm. In addition, fertiliser chemicals entered it as a result of agriculture. The lake thus suffered from eutrophication to such an extent that by 1990 the ecology had become unstable. It had caused heavy silting. As part of a project sponsored by the municipality of Binz and the East R√ºgen Rural Conservation Association (Landschaftspflegeverband Ostr√ºgen), 300,000 cubic metres of lake mud will be removed. In addition, phosphorus will be removed from 1.45 million cubic metres of sea water. After completion of the project, a nutrient-poor, macrophyte-dominated freshwater lake will be created. In the course of renovation in 2008 piping for the canalised Ahlbeck stream was replaced. A total of 450 metres of iron pipe was laid from the Schmachter See to the seabed of the Baltic.

A popular recreation spot, it has been referred to as the \\"jewel\\" of Wesel. Auesee was built from one of the largest gravel excavation sites in North Rhine- Westphalia.  Terrain  The lake has a surface area of . Within the lake there are distinct areas of shallow water with depths up to , while its deepest point is . The main lake basin is stable, and the banks are fixed. A peninsula stretching into the lake from the southeast divides the waters into a north-east and a south-west basin, both of which are connected to the north basin. As an artificial lake, Auesee has no inflow or outflow, and is fed exclusively by groundwater.  History  The formation of Auesee was initiated as a partnership between the municipality of Wesel and the excavating company H√ºlskens & Co. Negotiations began in 1959, and resulted in an agreement that the company would remove gravel from the site to use in their gravel pit, and the city would fill in the resulting pit to form a bathing lake. The project broke ground in May 1963 and excavation continued until 1993. The beach was first opened on a provisional basis in 1970, and proved to be an immediate success. Construction on the jetty and slipway for recreational boating began in 1971, and these areas were opened to the public in 1980.  Flora and fauna  wintertime Although it is an artificial lake, Auesee is well-integrated into its natural surroundings, providing a habitat for local plants and animals. The shores of Auesee are partially lined with a dense stand of riparian woodland. In some areas there are sparse beds of reeds. The underwater vegetation is richly developed. The shoreline is densely populated up to depths of with starry stonewort, or Nitellopsis obtusa. In the shallower areas, major species include Myriophyllum spicatum, Elodea nuttallii, Potamogeton lucens, and Potamogeton perfoliatus, as well as numerous other species of pondweed. There is very little phytoplankton in Auesee. Only diatoms and cryptophyceae occur regularly. Rhodomonas minuta, Gymnodinium helveticum, and some species of genus Cyclotella occur temporarily in larger numbers. The lake has been stocked with various types of fish, which have established breeding populations. Among those found in the lake are carp, pike, pike-perch, perch, tench, eels, and white fish like common roach and bream. Many waterfowl have taken up residence on the lake and the peninsula. Most commonly found are Eurasian coots, Mallard ducks, herons, pochards, and mute swans. A protected island for bird nesting, as well as floating nesting grounds within the lake, have been provided to encourage these species to settle at the lake.  Recreation  Auesee is a popular lake for recreation, with many different possible activities both in and out of the water. As a bathing lake, Auesee has a large sandy beach for swimming, sunbathing, and beach volleyball. The DLRG operates a lifeguard station on weekends and holidays. Auesee is also popular with divers, and in 2000, a yacht called The Poiseidon was sunk into the lake for divers to explore. The lake water is tested once a month during swimming season in accordance with the 2006 European Union Bathing Waters Directive, and may be closed down temporarily if harmful bacteria are found. The lake sports a slipway and a jetty for small pleasure craft. There are also lighted paths around the lake for walking, running, and cycling.

Location  The lake is located in the Horn-Lehe district of Bremen, north of B√ºrgerpark (the main city park) and the Stadtwald (city forest) between Technologiepark Bremen (Bremen Technology Park) and Bundesautobahn 27 in the north.  Features and usage  On the northeastern shore is the so-called \\"Uni- Wildnis\\", a nature reserve, a nude beach and, somewhat further west, the camping ground \\"HanseCamping Bremen\\". To the southeast, on the shore closest to the university, lies a grassy recreational area with a sand beach that is open to the public for swimming. There are occasional concerts and open air events in this area. The western end of the lake is currently used by windsurfers, anglers and divers. A water-skiing facility being planned in 2005 and 2007 caused a dispute. A citizens' initiative and a majority of the City Advisory Council on one side were in opposition to the Ministry for Interior and Sport (the potential operator) on the other side. Several investors plan to build hotels or wellness facilities against the will of the local residents on the north-eastern part of the lake. In summer, the water often develops an algae buildup, so the lake must occasionally be closed to swimmers.  History  The lake and the nature reserve were created by sand extraction during the development of the A 27 motorway and the construction of the university.  Public transport access  The bus stops of Wetterungsweg, Campingplatz, and Stadtwaldsee on bus line 28 of the Bremer Stra√üenbahn AG are all near the northwest shore of the lake.

It was used by the Red Army as a lazaret immediately after the war, and then as a fertilizer depot. In the beginning of the 1980s the church underwent a minor restoration, and began to function as the concert hall of the Kaliningrad Philharmonic. This made possible the installation of a new organ, which with its 44 registers and 3,600 pipes became a favourite of even the best organists of the Saint Petersburg music academy. The clock of the Kreuzkirche church was placed in the tower. The Kaliningrad authorities have refused to return the church to the Catholic community.

Origin That resistance started to organize under the inspiration of Consul General Aleksander Kawa≈Çkowski alias Justyn, in agreement with the Polish government in exile in London, helped by an emissary Czes≈Çaw Bitner. POWN Monika Resistance network Polish Resistance in France during WWII The organization was founded on 6 September 1941, in collaboration with the French Resistance. Its mission was intelligence, sabotage, writing and distribution of underground newspapers in Polish, and burning pro-Nazi German literature, such as newspapers, or biographies of supporters of fascism. The ability to parachute consisted of 60 bases in 20 reception in the south, 41 in the North and Center, according to messages sent by the French section of the BBC. Officers, weapons, radio equipment, and explosives were thus parachuted. The night of 22 to 23 July 1943, when Colonel Daniel Zdrojewski was dropped, marks the birth of the POWN - Polska Organizacja Walki o Niepodleg≈Ço≈õƒá - Polish Organization for the Struggle for Independence. In 1943, the Organization had 4000 members. Activities Colonel Zdrojewski was Chief of the Polish Military Operations in France. He was in close contact with General Marie- Pierre Koenig, commander in chief of the Forces Fran√ßaises de l'Int√©rieur (FFI). The relationship between the French and Poles, fighting a common enemy, were very friendly. There were Polish companies in the resistance, as part of FFI. The Organization's sophisticated sections included transport and delivery of equipment and men parachuted to their places of destination. Women and young Scouts incumbent liaison missions, intelligence, transport of underground newspapers, leaflets and so on. Intelligence units have sent information on 182 launchers V1 flying bombs and V2 which 162 were bombed by Allied aircraft. The mission of the Sabotage section was to destroy telephone lines and power lines, to draw up barricades on roads, destroy or move telephone poles. Their mission was also to cause or facilitate the desertion of forcibly enlisted Poles from the German army (Wehrmacht) or the Organization Todt, leading to 15 000 deserting the Wehrmacht and 10 000 the Organization Todt. General Eisenhower felt that the activities of the Resistance was a contribution equivalent to 8 military divisions. The Polish units openly fought the Wehrmacht. The battalion \\"Lw√≥w\\" fought in Cantal and Corr√®ze, \\"Warsaw\\" battalion was engaged in the operations of the Is√®re and the Alps (see Emile Garabiol). In July 1944 one month before the liberation of the Is√®re, the Polish students of the Lyc√©e of Villard-de-Lans took part in combat against the Germans alongside the French resistance on the plateau of the Vercors. Of the 27 Poles, mostly aged 16 to 19 years, 11 died, as did 2 teachers and the doctor of the school. Units of the POWN fought alongside FFI in the Departments of the C√¥te-d'Or, Jura and Sa√¥ne et Loire. When the contact was established between the Conseil National de la R√©sistance (CNR) and POWN the battle groups headed by Colonel Zdrojewski were attached to the movement of FFI on the basis of an agreement with Lyon on 28 May 1944 between the General Chaban-Delmas, Chief Military Provisional Government of the Republic of France and General Zdrojewski. Other Polish resistance groups in France POWN was not the only Polish group involved in the Resistance in France. Other resistance groups were similar to those issued by the French Communist Party as the Polish immigrant labor, the MOI. She maintained a correspondence with Fred (Alias Jacques Duclos). The group members of the Polish language MOI were mostly former soldiers of the International Brigades in Spain, Jaros≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski Brigade (about 3000 men). The arrival of the POWN in the mining area of Nord Pas de Calais, led to a confrontation between supporters of the Polish government in exile in London and the MOI of the CPF. Poles were also members in the Youth Battalions. They would later become members of the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP) after the attack on the USSR by the armies of Hitler in June 1941. Other units made of foreign Jews were active, with the identity or name \\"Jews born in Poland.\\" In 1944, they began to train Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN) who supported the policy of communism Poland, it was opposed to the POWN under the command of the Polish government in exile in London. Members of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS; a mainstream political party in Poland prior to the war) had created two underground organizations in the Department du Nord Pas de Calais early in 1941, the Organization and S Orzel Bialy (White Eagle). Both organizations were designed to inform the Poles in France on military developments and spread the idea of resistance to the Germans.

It is intended for anyone travelling through Europe. Pictograms and colour-coded maps of Europe show at a glance where the weather in the next 24 till 48 hours might be, or soon become, dangerous. The level of risk is colour-coded, based on likely damage, disruption and danger. Thanks to the use of similar and easy pictograms and colour-coding everyone can instantly understand the weather messages, whichever country is involved and whatever language is spoken. Gales, torrential rain, snow and ice, thunder and lightning, fog and extreme temperatures are all indicated, as well as weather conditions that could lead to increased risk, such as storm surges and high waves, forest fires and avalanches. Behind the pictograms there is a link to the current warnings. More detailed information is given on the WebPages of the co-operating weather services. These are easy to visit by clicking on the country and then on the logo of the weather service. Colours explained There are four colours to point out the weather conditions in a certain European country: green, yellow, orange and red. * Green If a country is coloured green, then there‚Äôs nothing to worry about. * Yellow This means potential danger. The weather is unlikely to be extreme but care is called for in activities that are dependent on the weather. * Orange Danger. There is severe weather that may cause damage or accidents. The weather brings risks. It is wise to be careful and keep abreast of the latest developments in the weather. Take heed of advice given by the authorities. * Red Great danger from extremely severe weather. Major damage and accidents are likely, in many cases with threat to life and limb, over a wide area. It‚Äôs wise to be extremely careful, pay constant attention to bulletins and obey the instructions and advice given by the authorities. There may be exceptional measures taken. Especially for people who are colour-blind, the site has a greyscale map which translates the warning colours in different greyscales. Member countries Meteoalarm.eu is developed by EUMETNET, the network of public European weather services who are members of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The weather service of Austria (Zentral Anstalt f√ºr Meteorologie und Geodynamik) is the responsible member for this project and does the technical realisation. The Dutch public weather service KNMI (Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut) gave close support. This project is officially called the European Multiservice Meteorological Awareness Project or EMMA-project. The member countries of www.meteoalarm.eu are: Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Republic of Moldova, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. Award The EMMA-project received in October 2008 the EMS (European Meteorological Society) Outreach & Communication Award for the website www.meteoalarm.eu. The panel thought that this project was an excellent example of putting a bridge between weather services, science and society. Usage and future developments The daily access rates reach 12 million per day during warning situations. In the future the website will be expanding. Probably more countries will be participating. It is foreseen to connect with information providers and to disseminate weather warnings through SMS and email. A feedback feature with the possibility to present photographs from users might be a further step.

Plot Two relationships in North London simultaneously draw to a close. Jed, a journalist is living with his long-term girlfriend, Cheryl, with the couple regularly seeing Jed's best friend Marcus and his girlfriend, Sophie. Compared to Marcus and Sophie, Jed and Cheryl's relationship is tired and dysfunctional which Jed tries to put right by suggesting marriage. When he asks her, Cheryl turns him down because of the lack of romantic chemistry in their relationship. In the meantime, Jed is preparing to interview the pretentious French film writer/director, Thierry Grimandi. Grimandi, who lives and works on the basis that he considers himself lucky \\"firstly because I am French, secondly because I make movies, and thirdly because I understand love\\" is shown regularly to give us the benefit of his advice. Jed and Cheryl turn to a relationship counseller but when asked if he loves Cheryl, Jed can't bring himself to say \\"Yes\\", and instead covers up by saying of course, he \\"loves her TO BITS\\". Cheryl is unimpressed as Jed cannot declare his love without adding a qualification, and as they begin to drift apart, she rediscovers the pleasures of being more independent. Jed looks to his friend, Marcus for help and for advice from Grimandi who tries to school him in the French philosophy of love. The scenes as Jed travels around London on his bicycle cleverly give the city an appearance of Paris. In the meantime, Marcus meets an old girlfriend, keen on travel, rediscovering his youth and finding that the flame between them burns as brightly as ever. He resolves to leave Sophie and go away with his old flame. Jed has long liked Sophie without realising that he was falling in love with her and even when Marcus and his new love leave London on the Eurostar to Paris, Jed lacks the courage to tell Sophie of his true feelings, even though she is aware of them herself. We see Jed undertaking the on-stage interview with Thierry Grimandi, for which he has been preparing and only then does he begin to understand his own feelings as he listens to the film director's pontifications. Jed rushes off to see Sophie, who greets him warmly, whilst we see Cheryl enjoying her new independence. We are left to assume that all live happily ever after....... Reception The film received an overall positive rating on the Rotten Tomatoes film review site, achieving 53% positive reviews.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/french_film/ Reviews to the film were mixed, but many were negative.

In 1901, the American malacologist Henry Augustus Pilsbry commented that the adult shell of Anostoma is \\"so bizarre that in the total absence of information upon its life history, no useful theory can be formulated to account for its peculiarities.\\" A very similar shell is found in the genus Ringicella Gray, 1847, which was previously considered to be merely a subgenus within Anostoma, but it is now considered to be a genus in its own right.  How the shell is carried  Drawing of juvenile shell of Anostoma depressum. A colored drawing of an adult shell of Anostoma depressum This is one of the most peculiar genera of land snails. The prominent feature of an upturned aperture (causing the adult snail to carry the shell spire down) is reflected in its scientific name Anostoma: ano, means up, or backwards, and stoma means mouth, from the Greek. In this genus, the adult snails carry the shell completely upside down, with the umbilicus uppermost, and the spire facing downwards. To make this extraordinary feat possible, the mature aperture of the shell is aligned in the same plane as the rather low spire of the shell. It appears that in juveniles, the shell is carried with the widest diameter vertically aligned, in other words, with the keel of the shell pointing up.Heath H. 1914. The anatomy of two Brazilian land-shells, Anostoma depressum and Tomigerus clausus. Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 65: 688-692, plate 31 [1913].  Shell description  The width of adult shells varies from 23 to 45 mm. Thomas Wyatt (1838)Thomas Wyatt. 1838. A Manual of Conchology: According to the System Laid Down by Lamarck, with the Late Improvements by De Blainville Exemplified and Arranged for the Use of Students. Harper & brothers, page 109. wrote about Anostoma: \\"An extraordinary shell, sometimes called the antique lamp from its form. Shell orbicular, the spire convex and obtuse; aperture round, toothed within, grinning, turned upward to the spire; margin reflected.\\" The shell of Anostoma is heliciform, biconvex, solid, the axis hollow, but imperforate in the adult stage. The shell is composed of few whorls, the last straightened, turning toward the margin and upward. Before the last half whorl is formed, the shell is umbilicate, and judging by the growth-lines, the juvenile and subadult shell is carried with the equatorial plane nearly vertical. However, as the last half whorl starts to form, the direction of growth changes: it tilts to the right, not to the left as in the Helicidae, and subsequently that half whorl grows up across the base of the shell. The final aperture in the adult is slightly above the keel or widest diameter of the shell. aperture of an adult shell of Anostoma. Sut = sutural fold SP = suprapalatal fold UP = upper palatal fold LP = lower platal fold B = basal fold C = columellar lamella IP = infraparietal lamella P = parietal lamella A = angular lamella The apex of the shell is smooth and somewhat flattened.Pilsbry H. A. 1901. in Tryon G. W. & Pilsbry H. A. 1901-1902 - Oriental Bulimoid Helicidae. Odontostominae. Cerionidae Volume 14. Manual of Conchology. Second series: Pulmonata. page 25‚Äì28 and 109‚Äì114. The peristome is expanded and reflexed. The semicircular aperture is turned upward, obstructed by numerous lamellae and folds. In the aperture of Anostoma, the primitive condition of the parietal armature remains, the angular, parietal and infraparietal lamellae being all present and separate. In Anostoma the parietal lamella is the longest while in other Odontostomini the infraparietal lamella is the longest. The \\"teeth\\" of the aperture are entirely homologous with those of Odontostomus. The similar genus Ringicella has an additional feature on its shell: the angular lamella and upper suprapalatal fold are concrescent and form a perforation in the lip at its upper end.  Anatomy  Pilsbry described the anatomy of what is now known as Ringicella ringens. At the time that species was described as an Anostoma, and Pilsbry (who was very thorough) did not make any comments that implied that there was any difference between the anatomy of that species and that of any of the other Anostoma species he examined. Thus, see Ringicella#Anatomy. Anatomy of Anostoma depressum was examined by Harold Heath in 1914.  Distribution  This genus of snails occurs in Brazil.

Radula The jaw and teeth are as they are in Macrodontes. The radula of Ringicella (and also Macrodontes) is rather aberrant for Bulimulinae: the central and lateral teeth have no side cusps, the marginals have an ectocone; the basal plate is short.Pilsbry H. A. 1901. in Tryon G. W. & Pilsbry H. A. 1901-1902 - Oriental Bulimoid Helicidae. Odontostominae. Cerionidae Volume 14. Manual of Conchology. Second series: Pulmonata. page 25‚Äì28 and 109‚Äì114. The article incorporates public domain texts from this reference. The jaw is smooth, arcuate. The teeth are as in the terrestrial Holopoda (see taxonomy of Holopoda) generally, the centrals and laterals with single broad cusps, marginals short, with the ectocone developed. Genitalia The genitalia are essentially similar to those of Odontostomus. The genitalia are exceedingly lengthened in Ringicella. The genitalia are of the haplogonous type, the long slender penis passing into a long vas deferens, upon which the penis retractor muscle is inserted; the duct of the globular spermatheca is extremely long. The elongation of the whole genital system is greater than in Helicoid snails generally, and doubtless correlated with the unusual length of the last whorl. Araujo (1963)J. L. de Barros Araujo 1963.

Central nervous system The cerebral ganglia are more separated than usual in the Holopoda. The cerebral ganglia are connected by a short narrow commissure; the suboesophageal ganglia are as usual in the Bulimulinae. Distribution This genus of snails occurs in Brazil. Pilsbry (1901) mentioned Ringicella carinatum as also occurring in Colombia, in high forests of the Magdalena river basin at 1830 m (6000 feet) above sea level, but Vera Ardila (2008) considers the presence of the species in Colombia to be doubtful.M√≥nica Luc√≠a Vera Ardila. 2008.

In May 1599 he led a Dutch and Zeeland fleet which set out to blockade the Iberian coast as part of the Eighty Years' War. En route they attacked the Spanish possession of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, but this was heavily defended and the attack was unsuccessful. It then moved to attack Spanish possessions in West Africa around Sao Tom√©, where Van der Does died, either of wounds received at Las Palmas or of malaria.

At an elevation of 35 m, its surface area is 4.7 ha. History During the Bronze Age - more than 3,000 years ago - clay was mined in the area of loam in order to produce pots and jars. Starting in 1840 the K√ºhnsche brickyard was extended by a clay and cement products factory. Following the bankruptcy of 1880, the factory building of 1883 was up until the 1960s as a day-and-garden \\"Seeschlo√ü\\" used with dance hall and bowling alley. Today, no traces of the factory are found. Another brickyard was built 1854th. It was modern and bigger and had a more effective ring oven which can have up to 12,000 burnt bricks daily. The brickyard was in operation until 1924. The 72 m high chimney was blown in 1932. A time to plant belonging building still stands in the Beneke Dorff Road 115, which is named after the former mill owners. Famous buildings, which were built from the bricks of the local brickworks, are the Red City Hall and the City Hall Reinickendorfer. By 1912, a lake was eventually created by the slow flow of groundwater. It was 30 to 40 m deep. Other witnessed the two flooded former clay pits (about 50 √ó 50 √ó 50 m and 150 m). They are located west, 500 meters away. Several surrounding street names also reminiscent of the clay mining. Geography The lake is located in L√ºbars, a locality belonging to the Berliner borough of Reinickendorf. The shape of the lake resembles a trapezoid (geometry) from the well S√ºds√ºdostufer 300 m long, which is followed by the east at a right angle, a 150 m long beach and under which a 200 m long beach faces parallel. In the north-north-east is a well 200 m long beach, the final oblique side of the \\"trapezoid\\". In the southern part of the bank overgrown with reeds and trees, steep and inaccessible and can not be swum. In the northern part, the banks are flat and occupied by 1926 built pool L√ºbars (lido L√ºbars). There are lawn, kept sandy beach and a few artificially fixed portions. The managed pool has basic facilities to bars, beach chair rentals and various sports and play facilities and the designated naturist area. The lake is accessible only through the pool. There is an inflow about 75 meters away and about 4 to 5 acre lake Hermsdorfer. This in turn flows through the Tegeler Fliess, which ultimately results in Lake Tegel.

The ¬´African Universal Orthodox-Catholic Church¬ª was organized by the charismatic African Bresi-Ando, but he and his followers vaguely knew the meaning of the term ¬´orthodoxy¬ª, and tried to find the true church. In 1972, Godfried Mantey and Kwame Joseph Labi, two of the church's youth leaders, read ¬´The Orthodox Church¬ª by Timothy (KALLISTOS) Ware which strengthened their church's religious quest. Two years later, Mantey and Labi met personally with representatives of the Eastern Orthodox world, and on 15 January 1978, Metropolitan Irineos, Metropolitan of Accra and All West Africa, (within the Patriarchate of Alexandria), made his first visit to the faithful of Ghana. By September 1982, the organization was officially admitted into the Eastern Orthodox communion within the Patriarchal Throne of Alexandria and All Africa. Now there is active missionary work, led by a resident archbishop. Thousands of Eastern Orthodox Christians from among the local population are served by 23 priests.

From the time he arrived in America until 1944, he lived in a refugee home sponsored by the Zeirei Agudah at 616 Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Rosenberger's father had a clothing store in Austria and he was interested in fabrics from a very early age.Wool: The Fabric of History, article: Rosenberger was approached by Moshe Neuman to find out how to best check garments for shatnes, a biblically forbidden mixture of wool and linen according to Jewish law. Rosenberger sought out garment dealers in both Williamsburg and the Lower East Side of Manhattan but found that there was both little knowledge and little interest in this area of Jewish law. Armed with a passion, Rosenberger enrolled in Manhattan's Textile High School in order to learn all he could about linen. He coupled this with taking menial jobs in the garment industry in order to find the many uses that linen had in clothing manufacturing. He also searched the New York Public Library for information on testing for the presence of linen, but found that all current tests were either too slow or too expensive for him to employ with any hopes of encouraging others to accept his recommendations. He still had to overcome the hurdle of convincing the Orthodox Jewish community of the importance of checking for shatnes. Rosenberger was often booted out of synagogues and assembly halls with derision by the public who did not believe him to be genuine. Rosenberger introduced a method of sample testing, which enabled one to certify a garment to be free of having shatnes, without thoroughly testing the garment. This included the ability to use unskilled persons across the United States of America who were coined with the term \\"sample testers\\", as they were able to take samples and send them to Rosenberger to verify them as being free of shatnez even though they were relatively untrained. With the later introduction of garments being imported from abroad with diverse and unsystematic standards, the \\"sample testing system\\" together with these \\"sample testers\\" has virtually disappeared. Educating the public Things changed when Rosenberger met Mike Tress, who was in charge of Orthodox Youth Magazine. Tress was impressed with Rosenberger's willingness and offered him free advertising space in the magazine, along with free use of the office phones and copy machine. Rosenberger taught himself to type so as to be able to produce posters and other forms of reading material about the importance of checking for shatnes. Tress also introduced Rosenberger to Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein, spiritual leader of the West Side Institutional Synagogue, who had many congregants involved in the garment industry, including Alex Levy, owner of Crawford Clothes. Goldstein convinced Levy to lend Rosenberger $250 for advertising space in The Jewish Morning Journal. The advertisements states that free shatnes checking would be available at Crawford Clothes. Although only five customers came to have their garments checked that first week, Crawford Clothes' competitors feared that customers would see them as not providing the same level of service at Crawford. They sought out Rosenberger and arranged for him to check their customers' merchandise as well, and when people saw that the clothiers could no longer guarantee their clothes were free of shatnes, Rosenberger's dream was realized; people became very interested in making sure that their clothing should not contain shatnes. Goldstein used his connections to network Rosenberger with the most influential Orthodox Jewish organizations of the time, such as the Agudas Israel and the National Council of Young Israel. Goldstein also penned a letter of endorsement in 1941 under the auspices of the Orthodox Union addressed to hundreds of congregational rabbis stressing the importance of informing their congregants of the need to have their garments checked for shatnes. Rosenberger died on the 7th day of the Jewish lunar month of Cheshvan. Williamsburg shatnes laboratory and beyond The Williamsburg shatnes lab at 203 Lee Avenue on the corner of Heyward Street. The upper sign states \\"Shatnes Laboratory of Mitzvot\\" and the phone number. In 1941, Rosenberger opened the first shatnes laboratory in North America in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. In his later years, Rosenberger had various assistants at his laboratory among them Yoel Schockett and Aron Drebin, who both later opened laboratories of their own. Schockett currently leads a shatnes laboratory in Lakewood, New Jersey and Drebin currently leads a shatnes laboratory in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn.

Historically, the baiting of wolves was more in the context of training dogs for wolf hunting than public entertainment. Wolves would sometimes be caught, either at the end of hunts, or in set traps, and would be set upon by the dogs, usually as a way of helping them master their fear of the animal. When training young or inexperienced dogs, the wolf would be hamstrung. Accounts as to how wolves react to being attacked by dogs vary, though John James Audubon wrote that young wolves generally show submissive behaviour, while older wolves fight savagely. Sculpture of a Dogue de Bordeaux fighting a wolf from the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle One of the earliest recorded incidents of wolf-baiting occurred during one of the Roman civil wars. The Dacians, hoping to take advantage of Rome's division, pressed their chieftain Scorlyo to launch an offensive. Scorlyo brought several dogs to the city square, which immediately began fighting one another. However, a captured wolf was brought in, to which the dogs ceased their fighting and attacked it. By this, Scorlyo intended to teach his people that whatever war a nation had within itself, it would always stand firm in attacking an outsider.The Book of Deeds of Arms and of Chivalry, by Christine, Sumner Willard, Charity Cannon Willard, translated by Sumner Willard, published by Penn State Press, 1999, However, wolves can be extremely dangerous opponents for dogs, even when outnumbered. Louis XIII of France once acquired an old wolf and set his best dogs on it three at a time. The wolf managed to kill twelve of them without sustaining any serious injury.An Introduction to the Field Sports of France: Being a Practical View of Hunting, Shooting and Fishing, on the Continent, by Roderic O'Connor published by J. Murray, 1846 The fighting styles of wolves and dogs differ significantly; while dogs typically limit themselves to attacking the head, neck and shoulder, wolves will make greater use of body blocks, and attack the extremities of their opponents.Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training: Adaptation and learning, By Steven R. Lindsay, Edition: illustrated, Published by Wiley- Blackwell, 2000, , , 410 pages Theodore Roosevelt once wrote that he considered a large mastiff a match for a wolf only if the latter was a young or undersized Texas wolf, though he conceded that even if the dog was the heavier of the two, its teeth and claws would be very much smaller, weaker and its hide less tough.

Retrieved 2011-09-11. Taxonomy In 1911, Paul Miller discovered the remains of various dissorophid bones in New Mexico that were attributed to a new species, Aspidosaurus novomexicanus. The skull closely resembled that of a specimen of Cacops aspidephorus found in Texas but the arrangement of ridges in the otic region was different. The teeth found were slender and conical and all of an approximately equal size. The vertebral column, pelvis and limb bones were also similar but the new specimen was distinguished from Cacops by the armour, the single row of vertical plates that were originally attached to the neural spines of the vertebrae. A. novomexicanus was later attributed to the genus Broiliellus. More recently, \\"A.\\" novomexicanus has been removed from Broiliellus and classified as a closer relative of Cacops. The original specimen is now housed in the University of California Museum of Paleontology and is referred to as the \\"Rio Arriba taxon\\" because of its uncertain phylogenetic placement.

Steen (1934)'s original species name Asaphestera platyris was retained for a skull which has been re-evlatuated as the earliest known synapsid. The type species of Asaphestera is Asaphestera platyris, named by Steen (1934) based on three skulls.

According to Dawson's species name, they renamed Asaphestera platyris to Asaphestera intermedia. Mann et al. (2020) re-evaluated purported Joggins microsaurs and found several unusual results. One of the skulls assigned the name Asaphestera platyris by Steen appeared to be a valid taxon, but instead of a microsaur it was the oldest known synapsid, possibly an eothyridid. Dawson's \\"Hylerpeton\\" intermedium was determined to be an indeterminate tetrapod and a nomen dubium. Additional Asaphestera material was named as a new genus of microsaur, Steenerpeton.

It contains a single species, Arizonerpeton wellsi. It lived in what is now the Swisshelm Mountains of modern-day Arizona, United States. This locality belongs to the Black Prince Limestone Formation, which is dated to the middle Pennsylvanian subperiod of the Carboniferous era.  Description  Arizonerpeton is known exclusively from a collection of unusual vertebrae collected by Robert Wells, the namesake of its specific name. These vertebrae can be designated as belonging to the order Nectridea, a collection of long-tailed tetrapods (amphibians in the broad sense) also including the famous \\"boomerang-headed\\" Diplocaulus. Like other nectrideans, Arizonerpeton's vertebrae had a single main body (a pleurocentrum) fused to a plate-like neural spine jutting out of the top. The flared rims of the front and rear surfaces of the pleurocentum possesses small structures which would have formed tongue-and-groove articulations with other vertebrae. The \\"tongue\\" projected forward from the front rim while the \\"groove\\" was present between two projections on the rear rim. The only definitive feature classifying this genus as a nectridean lies in the fact that there are also two pairs of joint plates (zygapophyses) on each end of the vertebrae. The vertebrae are amphicoelous (hourglass-shaped) from the side, but not strongly so, and are covered in small pits. On the side of each vertebra, an extension known as a transverse process juts out perpendicularly, although also occasionally with a very slight upward angle. The most unusual feature of these vertebrae lie in the fact that the neural spines are bifurcated. This means that a tall gap is present between the front and rear portions of each neural spine, effectively making it seem like there are two neural spines joined at the base. Vertebrae which are believed to have been part of the sacral (hip) region have shorter neural spines than those of the back, and are sightly titled backwards. Less extreme neural spine bifurcation is also known in the early diplocaulid Diceratosaurus and some specimens of the urocordylid Ctenerpeton, two other nectrideans. In addition, the pitted vertebrae are somewhat similar to those of diplocaulids. However, the deep neural spine bifurcation and \\"tongue-and-groove\\" articulations possessed by Arizonerpeton are unknown in any other nectridean groups. As a result, Arizonerpeton is usually treated as a member of Nectridea incertae sedis.

It is known from two specimens from the Late Carboniferous Cutler Formation of north-central New Mexico in the southwestern United States. The genus name derives from two Greek roots, ankos (\\"mountain glen or valley\\") and nastes (\\"inhabitant\\"), which refers to the type locality of El Cobre Canyon where the specimens were found. The species name derives from the Latin word vesperus (\\"western\\"). The more complete specimen, the holotype, is a partial skull with articulated mandibles and a substantial amount of the postcranial skeleton. The less complete specimen, the paratype, consists only of the right margin of the skull with an articulated mandible.  Anatomy  When originally described, only three other trematopid taxa were recognized: Acheloma, Actiobates, and \\"Trematops\\" (now a synonym of Acheloma); Ecolsonia, which is now considered a trematopid by most workers, had recently been re- described as a dissorophid on the basis of new material. Berman et al. suggested two autapomorphies: (1) an internal naris that is half as wide as it is long; and (2) a dense covering of non-overlapping scales or osteoderms in the dorsal trunk region. They further differentiated Anconastes from Acheloma and \\"Trematops\\" by several features: (1) large orbit with a width equal to 1/3 the midline length of the skull; (2) a short suborbital bar with a maxilla entering the orbital margin; (3) pointed snout without prominent dorsomedial expansion of the postparietals; (4) nasals, frontals, and parietals of subequal length; (5) parietals approximately three times the length of the postparietals; (6) frontals not extending beyond the anterior margin of the orbit; (7) large interpterygoid vacuities; (8) an open basicranial joint; and (9) absence of an internarial opening or bone. They differentiated Anconastes from Actiobates by the presence of a quadratojugal contributing substantially to the ventral margin of the otic notch. More recent review work has refined the diagnostic features to a handful of the original features proposed by Berman et al. with the study of additional trematopid material and the description of new taxa.

It is known from several skulls and some postcranial material found from the Argana Formation in Morocco, which dates back to the Late Triassic.

Although the related latiscopid Latiscopus disjunctus possesses exoccipitals that are underplated (a feature that suggests that it is a member of the family Trematosauridae) Almasaurus is not considered to be a trematosaurid because it lacks such underplating. Almasaurus was considered to be a capitosaurian by Warren & Black (1985) because it shared several characters with the group, including a deeply notched squamosal and a lacrimal flexure, while supposedly exhibiting none of the characters associated with trematosaurians. However, more recent studies have concluded that Almasaurus is either a temnospondyl more basal than the clade formed from the dichotomy between Capitosauria and Trematosauria or that the genus is closely related to the trematosaurian family Metoposauridae, perhaps being a sister taxon of it.

The taxon is based on a single specimen represented by a partial skull and associated postcranial skeleton that is currently deposited at the University of Kansas Natural History Museum.

The type and only species is Acherontiscus caledoniae, named by paleontologist Robert Carroll in 1969. Members of this genus have an unusual combination of features which makes their placement within amphibian-grade tetrapods uncertain. They possess multi-bone vertebrae similar to those of embolomeres, but also a skull similar to lepospondyls. The only known specimen of Acherontiscus possessed an elongated body similar to that of a snake or eel. No limbs were preserved, and evidence for their presence in close relatives of Acherontiscus is dubious at best. Phylogenetic analyses created by Marcello Ruta and other paleontologists in the 2000s indicate that Acherontiscus is part of Adelospondyli, closely related to other snake-like animals such as Adelogyrinus and Dolichopareias. Adelospondyls are traditionally placed within the group Lepospondyli due to their fused vertebrae (although Acherontiscus is an exception among adelospondyls). Some analyses published since 2007 have argued that adelospondyls such as Acherontiscus may not actually be lepospondyls, instead being close relatives or members of the family Colosteidae. This would indicate that they evolved prior to the split between the tetrapod lineage that leads to reptiles (Reptiliomorpha) and the one that leads to modern amphibians (Batrachomorpha). Members of this genus were probably aquatic animals that were able to swim using snake-like movements.  Discovery  Acherontiscus is known only from a single skeleton, RSM 1967/13/1, which is housed at the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh. Although it is known that this specimen was discovered in 1964, additional information on the location of its discovery is not known. However, the rock slab in which it was preserved is a type known as coal shale, similar to that of early Carboniferous (Mississippian)-era ironstone from Burghlee in Midlothian. The slab also includes remains of tiny crustaceans known as ostracods, as well as pollen spores. The ostracods were identified as the late Paleozoic genus Carbonita, although different scientists studying the slabs disagree on the precise species of Carbonita. The pollen spores correspond to species of plants which lived approximately between the late Vis√©an and middle Namurian (Serpukhovian) ages of the Carboniferous. Skeletal diagram showing preserved bones of the Acherontiscus holotype. Limbs are not depicted in this interpretation. This holotype skeleton was mostly complete, but poorly preserved. The skull was flattened and some of the surface was eroded, while the vertebrae were mostly missing, with only detailed impressions remaining. By dissolving away remaining fragments with hydrochloric acid casting these impressions in silicone rubber, the preparators of the specimen were able to more easily describe it. The specimen received a formal description and name as the species Acherontiscus caledoniae courtesy of Robert Carroll in 1969. The generic name Acherontiscus is a reference to Acheron, a river which in Greek mythology flowed into the underworld as a tributary of the river Styx. This naming convention is an homage to Edward Drinker Cope's affection for naming snake-like lepospondyls after infernal rivers, such as Phlegethontia (named after Phlegethon) and Cocytinus (named after Cocytus). The specific name, caledoniae, references Caledonia, the Latin name for Scotland.  Description  Acherontiscus was serpentine in general body shape, with an elongated body and relatively small head in comparison. It may have been completely legless due to a lack of preserved limb bones. Although this hypothesis seems probable, Acherontiscus probably had limbed ancestors considering that it possessed a well-developed dermal shoulder girdle. It was small in size; the only known specimen was about 14 centimeters (5.5 inches) long. However, it may have been slightly longer considering that part of the tail is believed to be missing.  Skull  The skull is robust, with small orbits (eye holes) set towards the front of the head. Although erosion and overlap makes it difficult to distinguish individual bones of the skull, certain ones can be identified. The tip of the snout contained tiny external nares (nostril holes) preceded by premaxillary bones and followed by unusually small lacrimal and nasal bones. In order to accommodate for the small size of the nasals, the frontals and adjacent prefrontal bones are elongated, occupying the length of almost the entire upper side of the snout. Diagrams and CT scans of the skull The part of the skull behind the eyes is composed of several bones which were difficult to interpret due to crushing and differing hypotheses about their arrangement and naming. Perhaps the least controversial were the jugal and postorbital bones, which were found by most paleontologists who studied the specimen. Some authors, such as Carroll (1969), Carroll & Kuhn (1998), and Ruta et al. (2003) identified a postfrontal bone in front of the postorbital, but CT data from Clack et al. (2019) argued that this bone was actually the postorbital, which was followed by a supratemporal bone. Above those bones were a pair of parietals which overlooked much longer bones that reached the rear face of the skull. These bones included the squamosal and quadratojugal bones (near the jaw), and possibly one or more additional bones. The rear edge of the skull was smoothly convex, with no unusual embayments such as the otic notch of temnospondyls and other \\"labyrinthodonts\\". The bones at the rear part of the head are covered with shallow pits, while bones located further forward are smoother. Certain bones near the orbits possessed sensory grooves known as lateral lines. The skull of Acherontiscus was generally similar to that of microsaurs such as Microbrachis and Cardiocephalus. Some have argued that this similarity is enhanced further due to how possibly only a single bone formed the temporal region of the skull (between the bones of the rear skull roof and those of the jaw area). Most other early tetrapods have two to three distinct bones in that area: the supratemporals, tabular bones, and sometimes the intertemporals. Prior to the 1970s, most studies of microsaurs often considered the single bone they retain to be the supratemporal (including in the original 1969 description of Acherontiscus). However, many studies since then identified it as the tabular bone. According to Andrews & Carroll (1991), adelospondyls possess an even more extreme reduction in the number of skull bones in this area. Their tabular bones fuse to the squamosal bones under them, creating a bone termed a 'squamosotabular'. Although the original description of Acherontiscus depicted the squamosal as separate from the tabular, Ruta et. al. (2003) interpreted the skull differently. According to their interpretation, Acherontiscus also possessed the fused squamosotabular of adelogyrinids, supporting its status as an adelospondyl. A 2010 dissertation by David Marjanoviƒá claimed that the squamosotabular of adelospondyls was simply a typical squamosal bone, with the tabular being completely lost. On the other hand, Clack et al. (2019) once again found multiple bones above the squamosal in Acherontiscus, namely a large postparietal (or a pair of postparietals) edged by small tabulars. The lower jaw was deep yet tapered towards the front, and contained at least 18 preserved teeth. Four teeth near the back of the jaw were large, blunt, and ridged, while most of the rest were much smaller. The upper jaw's teeth were smaller and more numerous, with at least 32 shared between the maxilla and premaxilla. Some teeth near the rear of the maxilla were somewhat enlarged. The differing numbers of upper and lower jaw teeth is also observed in colosteids. However, Acherontiscus' teeth lacked the maze-like internal folding of enamel which gave \\"labyrinthodonts\\" (including colosteids) their name. Bones of the hyoid apparatus have also been found near the skull.  Vertebrae  This diagram shows the distribution of different vertebrae types among various stegocephalian groups. Acherontiscus, despite being part of Stem Tetrapoda, has vertebrae resembling those of the group Embolomeri Acherontiscus possessed an unorthodox feature compared to most lepospondyls. In most lepospondyls, each vertebra is composed of a single complex bone. However, Acherontiscus has vertebrae with multiple separate bony components. The main body (centrum) of each vertebral segment is formed by two of these bones, an intercentrum (at the front) and pleurocentrum (at the back), with an additional third bone, the plate-like neural spine, jutting out of the top of each intercentrum. This condition was much more similar to that of embolomeres than lepospondyls. More than 32 composite vertebrae were preserved. Extrapolating from missing chunks of the spine, it was likely that Acherontiscus had up to 64 vertebrae in total. The intercentra and pleurocentra are similar in size and shape, with the pleurocentra being slightly longer rostrocaudally (in the head-to-tail orientation) in most situations. The intercentra also have facets which would have connected to double-headed ribs. The first few neck vertebrae are presumably missing, making it impossible to determine the exact nature of the skull joint. The first preserved vertebra is a relative short pleurocentrum, rather than a complex skull joint vertebra such as an atlas or axis. The rest of the vertebrae in the neck area are crescent-shaped and tube-like, although by the 5th preserved vertebrae at least the pleurocentra have transitioned into enclosed cylinders, each perforated by a hole for the spinal cord. The intercentra transitioned more slowly, as no intercentra between the 6th (which was crescent-shaped) and the 25th (cylindrical) vertebrae were visible from the front. Neural spines preserved from the hip region (around vertebra 30) are low and set far back on their respective vertebrae, although they are also preserved displaced from them. This indicates that they were also separate bones from the intercentra and pleurocentra. The centra elements are covered with a small number of large and deep pits, although in the tail region (around vertebra 40) these pits become shallower. The two centra elements also become basically equal in size in this part of the spine. The few tail vertebrae that are preserved also possess haemal arches, loosely-attached spiny structures jutting out the bottom of the intercentra.  Other bones  No bones of either the front or hind limbs were preserved in the holotype of Acherontiscus. In addition, bones of the endochondral shoulder girdle (i.e. the scapulae and coracoids) are also missing. However, a well-developed dermal shoulder girdle (consisting of clavicles and an interclavicle) is preserved, indicating that the ancestors of Acherontiscus possessed forelimbs. In 1969 Carroll considered it unlikely that Acherontiscus would not have possessed limbs considering the size of the shoulder girdle, with the missing bones perhaps becoming misplaced through the processes by which the animal died and became fossilized. However, by 1998 he considered it equally plausible that the animal was completely legless, with the dermal girdle retained as a relic of an earlier ancestor. The dermal shoulder girdle is represented by a plate- like interclavicle (which would have been at the center of a living animal's chest) as well as two clavicle bones branching up from it. The simple and oval-shaped interclavicle is bisected by a low ridge and covered in grooves. The clavicle bones are thick and rounded at their base but taper as they extend outwards (and upwards in the case of a living animal). No conclusive evidence of a pelvic girdle or hindlimbs have been found, although Carroll (1969) considered that a few bone fragments around the 26th to 31st vertebrae may have been leg bones. As a whole, the lack of known limb and endochondral material yet the retention of a dermal shoulder girdle is a condition similar to that of the other family of adelospondyls, the adelogyrinids. Although forelimbs were supposedly found in various adelogyrinids in the late 1960s, Andrews & Carroll (1991) found that all cases of forelimb bones in adelogyrinids were actually misinterpretations. For example, putative forelimbs discovered in Adelogyrinus and Palaeomolgophis by Brough & Brough (1967) were respectively re-identified as hyoid bones and ribs. Carroll (1967) also claimed that forelimbs were present in Adelospondylus, but these were found to be hyoids as in Adelogyrinus. A few small, elongated scales have been preserved among the bones of the Acherontiscus skeleton. These scales show some similarities to those of microsaurs, but also towards other tetrapods such as the dvinosaurian temnospondyl Trimerorhachis.  Classification   Taxonomic uncertainty  The classification of Acherontiscus has gone through much revision in the past, as it shows a mixture of characteristics from various groups of non-amniote tetrapods (amphibians in the broad definition of the term). Traditionally, ancient amphibians have been classified into two groups: labyrinthodonts and lepospondyls. Labyrinthodonts can be characterized by their maze-like tooth enamel, the presence of multiple bones forming each vertebral segment, and a generally crocodile-like appearance. Modern analyses have concluded that the order \\"Labyrinthodontia\\" is composed of various groups of non-amniote stegocephalians scattered within and near the tetrapod family tree. Such groups include stem-tetrapods such as Ichthyostega, as well as the diverse groups Embolomeri and Temnospondyli, the latter of which probably including modern lissamphibians such as frogs and salamanders. Lepospondyls, on the other hand, generally had single-bone vertebrae and often possessed long bodies and reduced (or even absent) limbs. Between 1969 and 2003, many paleontologists could not place Acherontiscus into any group with absolute certainty. In some ways Acherontiscus resembled lepospondyls. For example, its eel-like and potentially legless body was similar to members of the groups Lysorophia, A√Østopoda, and Adelospondyli, while its skull and teeth closely resembled those of several microsaurs such as Microbrachis. However, the presence of multiple bones of near-equal size composing each vertebra was more similar to the condition in labyrinthodonts, specifically members of the group Embolomeri. Carroll's 1969 description of Acherontiscus refused to place the genus into a particular subclass and order. Since then, some additional information has assisted classification of Acherontiscus. A review of microsaurs by Carroll and Gaskill in 1978 found that the genus did not have enough specific features to justify inclusion in that group. For example, Acherontiscus possesses lateral line canals (which are unknown in microsaurs), and did not preserve (or possess) the characteristic atlas bone of microsaurs. Similarly, Wellstead's 1991 review of lysorophians rejected any placement of Acherontiscus within the group, as its skull and pectoral girdle were quite different from the condition in lysorophians, which had highly modified skulls and practically no bony elements in their shoulder region.  Ruta et al. (2003): Acherontiscus as an adelospondyl (within Lepospondyli)  adelogyrinids such as this genus, Adelospondylus. Ruta et al. (2003) considers Acherontiscus and adelogyrinids to be members of the group Lepospondyli Acherontiscus was finally placed in a specific broader group by Ruta et al. (2003)'s study on early tetrapods. They argued that the Acherontiscus specimen was a young or neotenic member of the group Adelospondyli. The authors of this study re-examined the specimen, providing new interpretations of the crushed skull bones, such as the presence of a squamosotabular and a postorbital which did not contact the orbit. The short nasal bones, long frontal bones, presence of lateral lines, and eyes set far forward on the skull were combined with the new interpretations to construct Acherontiscus as having a skull very similar to that of adelospondyls. The snake-like body, highly reduced or absent limbs, and large pectoral girdle were also general features supporting the placement of Acherontiscus among the adelospondyls. The only feature with the potential to endanger this classification is the embolomere-like vertebrae of Acherontiscus, which contrast with the vertebrae of adelogyrinids (with only a single main bone in the centra). However, new data has shown that several other early lepospondyls did not possess single-bone vertebrae. For example, the early a√Østopod Lethiscus still retained separate intercentra and pleurocentra, and a few early microsaurs such as Trihecaton possessed small intercentra to complement their large pleurocentra. Lepospondyls are typically grouped together based on their single-bone (lepospondylous) vertebrae, but the fact that many lepospondyl groups evolved these vertebrae independently casts doubt onto the validity of the group. Animals like Acherontiscus, Lethiscus, and Trihecaton show that Lepospondyli, rather than being a traditional monophyletic group with a single ancestor, may in fact be a polyphyletic collection of unrelated tetrapods and stem-tetrapods, with different groups having ancestry in different locations on the stegocephalian family tree. Vallin & Laurin (2004) considered adelospondyls to be closely related to a√Østopods due to their similar body types and the fact that they are among the oldest known lepospondyls. However, this study did not feature or discuss Acherontiscus. The following cladogram is a portion of the strict consensus tree of Ruta et al. (2003), showing Lepospondyli as monophyletic and Acherontiscus as a member of Adelospondyli. The strict consensus tree of this analysis is the average result of 64 most parsimonious trees (MPT). An MPT is a family tree with the fewest possible number of evolutionary 'steps' where sampled anatomical traits are acquired, lost, and reacquired. Under the principle of Occam's razor, an MPT is the most accurate family tree as it assumes that evolutionary paths are not more complex than they need to be. When more than one MPT is found by the phylogenetic software (for example, this study has 64, each at 1375 steps), a strict consensus tree has to be created. A strict consensus tree is a compromise between MPTs which retains the broad shape of every MPT while not being specific enough to closely resemble a single one. This lack of specificity can sometimes result in a polytomy, where a branch of taxa are collapsed into a multi-pronged group due to MPTs disagreeing on the group's structure.  Hook (1983), Ruta & Coates (2007): Acherontiscus as an adelospondyl (near Colosteidae)  colosteids such as this genus, Greererpeton If Lepospondyli is indeed polyphyletic, then its constituents must find new locations on the family tree of stegocephalians. Although every MPT from Ruta et al. (2003) found adelospondyls (including Acherontiscus) to be within a monophyletic Lepospondyli, several other family trees found by the analysis offered an alternate position. A tree 1380 steps long (only 5 steps longer than the MPTs) placed adelospondyls far away from other lepospondyls, instead placing them as the sister group to colosteids, a group of long-bodied stem-tetrapods only slightly more advanced than Icthyostega-grade stegocephalians. Studies on data distribution within this alternate result indicate that it was only barely inferior to the traditional position of adelospondyls within Lepospondyli. This result intrigued the authors, and a follow-up review by Ruta & Coates in 2007 found that adelospondyls were close to colosteids even in their MPTs, indicating that this position was significantly more likely than a position within Lepospondyli. These studies were not the first to suggest a close relation between Acherontiscus and Colosteidae. In 1983, Robert Hook observed several shared characteristics between adelospondyls and colsteids in his redescription of Colosteus. He noted that both colosteids and adelospondyls possessed a prefrontal bone which contacted the front edge of the orbit, and a postorbital bone which contacted the parietal near the back of the head. In addition, he noted that both groups combined traditionally \\"labyrinthodont\\" features (such as the presence of lateral lines) with \\"lepospondyl\\" features (such as the lack of otic notches). However, Hook's hypothesis did not receive further discussion until Ruta et al. (2003) and Ruta & Coates (2007). Phylogenetic studies performed since Ruta & Coates (2007) have generally supported this hypothesis. The following cladogram is the strict consensus tree of 9 MPTs found in the reweighted analysis of Ruta & Coates (2007). The reweighted analysis is similar to a typical phylogenetic analysis, but certain transitions involve different numbers of steps due to different evolutionary traits being weighted. The weighting of traits relates to how consistent the traits appear among the tetrapod family tree. Traits which are prone to being convergently evolved are emphasized less during \\"steps\\" in the family trees, while traits that are unique to only a few groups are emphasized more: One particular study which heavily discussed the relations of Acherontiscus and other adelospondyls was a 2016 study on how time sampling can alter phylogenetic trees. This study, Bernardi et al. (2016), noted that specializations in advanced amphibians may pollute the relations of more basal taxa when all of them are placed in a single phylogenetic analysis. In order to test this possibility, the study separated prehistoric stegocephalians into five groups depending on their age: Devonian (D), Mississippian (M), Pennsylvanian (P), Permian (R), and Mesozoic (Z). Acherontiscus and other adelospondyls were placed within the \\"M\\" group. Next, the study constructed five separate datasets focusing on taxa from each group, as well as four more datasets which progressively incorporated more groups (from \\"D+M\\" to \\"D+M+P+R+Z\\"). Each of these nine datasets was an altered version of the dataset used by Ruta & Coates (2007), except with certain parameters changed and traits only being scored if they were informative to the relations of any taxa within each dataset. These nine datasets were termed \\"re-analyzed trees\\" In addition, Bernardi et al. (2016) used the Ruta & Coates (2007) dataset to construct another group of datasets. However, these additional datasets (termed \\"pruned trees\\") did not undergo the changed parameters and traits of the \\"re-analyzed trees\\". Instead, they followed exactly the same methods as Ruta & Coates (2007), with the only difference being that taxa were excluded (\\"pruned\\") based on time period. The \\"pruned trees\\" used the same nine grouping protocol as the \\"re-analyzed trees\\". When this eighteen-part analysis was finally undertaken, a few interesting results were gathered. Acherontiscus and the other adelospondyls were found to be close to the colosteids in almost all of the sets they were included in. However, a few sets had different results. The \\"D+M re-analyzed tree\\" also included Lethiscus among the adelospondyls and colosteids, rather than the a√Østopods as usually believed. The \\"D+M+P re-analyzed tree\\" placed adelospondyls away from colosteids, instead back with lepospondyls as previous hypotheses have argued for. However, this was the only set which included this result. The seventeen other sets used in this analysis agreed that adelospondyls were stem-tetrapods close to Colosteidae. Nevertheless, this reinterpretation is not supported by every analysis since Ruta & Coates (2007). Marjanovic & Laurin (2019) revised some scores and methodology used by Ruta & Coates (2007), including removing their reweighting protocol. They found that Acherontiscus and the rest of the adelospondyls shifted back into a monophyletic Lepospondyli, where they were usually positioned near urocordylids and aistopods. Clack et al. (2019) found an unusual combination of both of these hypotheses, by placing Acherontiscus and other adelospondyls as stem-tetrapods in a clade also containing colosteids, urocordylids, aistopods (which have recently been reconsider as stem-tetrapods too), and occasionally Tulerpeton. Their result also placed the recently discovered stem-tetrapod Aytonerpeton within Adelospondyli as the sister taxon to Acherontiscus.  Paleobiology  Due to the presence of lateral lines, Acherontiscus individuals are inferred to be aquatic animals. Carroll (1969) also noted that even if limbs were present in life, their lack of preservation would indicate that they had very little bone material. This also supports the hypothesis that Acherontiscus lived practically their entire lives in water. The long body and embolomerous vertebrae would have facilitated side-to-side \\"snake-like\\" swimming. As with other adelospondyls, the large hyoid apparatus of Acherontiscus suggest that they possessed gills, although such gills were probably internal like those of fish rather than external like those of neotenic salamanders. Noting the large, blunt, and ridged teeth of the lower jaw, Clack et al. (2019) argued that Acherontiscus was durophagous, meaning that it fed on hard-shelled invertebrates. Some of its prey items could have included aquatic molluscs and crustaceans, especially ostracods, which were common in the rock slab which preserved the specimen. The deep jaw also supports this hypothesis since it would have given Acherontiscus a strong bite. Acherontiscus is the oldest known tetrapod with heterodont dentition (i.e. teeth of different shapes and sizes), predating the next oldest (the Early Permian captorhinid Opisthodontosaurus) by about 50 million years.

CAPA also manages several other venues in Columbus including the Ohio, the Palace, and the Lincoln Theatres. History Design Great Southern Hotel and Theatre building Between 1889 and 1893 a series of fires destroyed five downtown Columbus theaters. As a result, a group of businessmen decided to develop a new hotel and theater with modern construction and safety features on the southern edge of downtown. The building was called \\"The Great Southern Fireproof Hotel and Opera House\\", and was designed by the local architectural firm of Dauben, Krumm, and Riebel. Construction began in 1894. Both the theater and the hotel were constructed of \\"fireproof\\" tile, brick, iron, steel, and concrete. The theater's auditorium design was progressive for its day and was reminiscent of Louis H. Sullivan's 1891 Schiller Theatre in Chicago. From the proscenium opening, a series of concentric arches dotted with incandescent electric lights radiate into the house, resulting in superior lighting and excellent acoustics. Built to be self-sufficient, the theater, one of the first commercial buildings in Columbus to use electricity, generated its own power. Additionally, the building had three wells in the basement, from which it produced its own water supply. The theatre currently seats 933 and is an intimate \\"jewel box\\" type theater with two balconies. In 1982, the Southern Theatre and its associated hotel were added to the National Register of Historic Places. Use The Great Southern Theatre originally hosted theatrical touring productions. Sarah Bernhardt was just one of the famous performers to play the theater in its first two decades. In the 1910s and 1920s the theater, now called the Southern, featured first run silent films and live vaudeville. From the 1930s on, the Southern was a popular home for second-run double features. In the 1970s the theater briefly returned to first run fare as the Towne Cinema, showing black exploitation movies. Throughout the 1970s the Southern also hosted a weekly live Country Music Jamboree, sponsored by local radio station WMNI. The theater closed in 1979 and in 1986 was acquired by CAPA. After sitting empty for nearly two decades, the Southern was completely restored by CAPA in 1997-98 during an extensive 14-month rebuilding process. The newly restored Southern Theatre reopened on September 26, 1998.The Southern Theatre is a featured on many of Columbus's Architectural tours.

The settlements are located on either side of a ridge with Vikadal in between. Indre √Ölvik has been heavily industrialised since the early 1900s, when Bj√∏lvefossen A/S was established. The village lies along the √Ölvik bay on the northern shore of the Hardangerfjord. √Ölvik Church is located in the village. The village has a population (2019) of 487 and a population density of .  History  The name \\"√Ölvik\\" is probably derived from Old Norse word «´lr which means \\"alder\\" and the word vik which means \\"bay\\".Brekke (ed.), side 368. The settlement here dates back at least to 600-700 BC, as documented by bronze artifacts found in the Vikedal area.Brekke (ed.), p369. In medieval times, √Ölvik belonged to the estates of Norheim in Norheimsund.Brekke (ed.),p371. The foundations for Indre √Ölvik as an industrial district were laid in 1905, when Bj√∏lvefossen A/S was incorporated to exploit the Bj√∏lvo waterfalls for hydroelectric energy.Martin Byrkjeland:'Spelet om Bj√∏lvefossen' [The game about Bj√∏lvefossen] in (Foss√•skaret and Stor√•s), pp18-19. In 1907, the village still had only 74 inhabitants, as little activity took place until Bj√∏lvefossen A/S was sold to Elektrokemisk A/S in 1913. After this, construction of the Bj√∏lvefossen hydroelectric plant commenced. The construction was however stalled due to concession disputes, as it was claimed that the work on the plant had begun before Norwegian escheat laws had been put in force in 1907. The disputes were solved in 1916 and both the plant and factories were completed by 1919, producing calcium carbide for a brief time. The village's population briefly rose by 500 workers, but most left shortly thereafter, as financial problems and an accident destroying the pipelines that supplied water from the hydroelectric reservoir brought production to a halt. This forced Bj√∏lvefossen A/S to default on large loans.Martin Byrkjeland:'Spelet om Bj√∏lvefossen' [The game about Bj√∏lvefossen] in (Foss√•skaret and Stor√•s), pp27-32. Large-scale production was only resumed in 1928, when, after the pledgees had established contact with C. Tennant's Sons & Co., Bj√∏lvefossen A/S was given major sales contracts for ferrosilicon to the British steel industry, in an effort to open a price war with the European ferrosilicon syndicate.Martin Byrkjeland:'Spelet om Bj√∏lvefossen' [The game about Bj√∏lvefossen] in (Foss√•skaret and Stor√•s), pp36-40. Production was briefly hit by the Great depression, but quickly rebounded and a production line for ferrochrome was established in 1934, the same year that the company saw its first profit.Martin Byrkjeland:'Spelet om Bj√∏lvefossen' [The game about Bj√∏lvefossen] in (Foss√•skaret and Stor√•s), p40. √Ölvik gained a road connection to Bergen in 1937, when the Fyksesund Bridge was opened.Brekke (ed.), p88. Nearly all of the village's infrastructure was owned by Bj√∏lvefossen A/S for a long time, to a great extent making it a company town, and it was a separate regulatory area until 1965.'Her p√• stedet' [In this place] in (Foss√•skaret and Stor√•s), p152. In the 1950s several new furnaces for production of ferrochrome and ferrosilicon were installed.J√∏rund Falnes:'De lunefulle ovnene' [The capricious furnaces] in (Foss√•skaret and Stor√•s), p94. During the 1960s, Bj√∏lvefossen struggled to remain competitive, yet was able to invest in new production facilities on both production lines. In the 1970s, however, new technology in steel production reduced demand for the low-carbon ferrochrome that was produced. Government environmental regulations also put pressure on the production economy. Employment at the plant thus peaked at about 600 in this decade,Eva-Marie Tveit:'Et mykere verk' [A softer plant] in (Foss√•skaret and Stor√•s), p127. before ferrochrome production was discontinued on the old production line in 1979 and on the new in 1983.J√∏rund Falnes:'De lunefulle ovnene' [The capricious furnaces] in (Foss√•skaret and Stor√•s), p94-95. Ferrosilicon production was prioritised to comply with environmental standards, furnaces were rebuilt to a closed type, making it possible to recycle excess heat in a steam turbine and to remove all dust from the discharge fumes. The dust, silica slurry, was found to be a saleable product.J√∏rund Falnes:'De lunefulle ovnene' [The capricious furnaces] in (Foss√•skaret and Stor√•s), p96. The 1970s saw the entrance of women into production positions at the plant. Before this, the female population of √Ölvik was mostly engaged in housekeeping, although some positions were open to women in cleaning and clerk jobs, besides public services. The first women begun work in the packing facilities, and relatively few took positions at the furnaces.Eva-Marie Tveit:'Et mykere verk' [A softer plant] in (Foss√•skaret and Stor√•s), p124-25. In 2001, the owner, Elkem decided to lay off 100 of 245 workers at Bj√∏lvefossen A/S. Natural geography √Ölvik is situated on the northern side of the Hardangerfjord, facing the deepest stretch of the fjord.Helland-Hansen (ed.), p64 √Ölvik is divided by a ridge into two main settlements, Indre √Ölvik and Ytre √Ölvik. The name √Ölvik denotes the two settlements as a unit. View of Indre √Ölvik from the west. Bj√∏lvefossen A/S in the foreground. The bedrock in the √Ölvik area consists mainly of gabbro and granite from the Bergsdal field.Helland-Hansen (ed.), pp2-3 The vegetation at sea level is sarmatic mixed forest, rich in alm. Mountainous forests are found at higher altitudes.Helland-Hansen (ed.), pp140 and 570-571 The village has several populations of the orchid sword-leaved helleborine and a natural reserve containing an especially large population of taxus baccata. Economy The former Bj√∏lvefossen A/S is the village's main employer, it has historically dominated to such an extent that the village has been referred to as the most typical monotown in Norway.'Nytt fellesskap i ny type samfunn' in (Foss√•skaret and Stor√•s), p46. It is now a subsidiary of Elkem, Elkem Bj√∏lvefossen, which in turn is owned by China National Bluestar. In 2006 it was decided to move ferrosilicon production to Elkem Iceland, and at that time the plant had a staff of about 160. Elkem has since announced that the old production will be replaced by a process recycling waste from aluminium production, which will require a staff of about 60. However, as of March 2012, production was still running at full capacity, and hiring new staff was being discussed. Nye Bj√∏lvo hydroelectric power plant. The original building is seen in the background. Bj√∏lvo kraftverk, the hydroelectric plant originally built to power industrial production was returned to state ownership by escheat in 1964, and is now owned by Statkraft. The current, modernised plant, Nye Bj√∏lvo, was completed in 2006 and at that time had the highest free-fall pressure shaft of any European hydroelectric plant, at more than 600 m. It has a yearly output of about 390 GWh. The plant exploits the reservoir Bj√∏lsegr√∏vatnet, which has a regulated surface at 850‚Äì879 meters above sea level. The municipality of Kvam runs the following public services in √Ölvik: a kindergarten, a school covering the 1st through 7th grades, a medical office and a care home. Cultural life and heritage The √Ölvik Industrial Worker's Museum documents the village's labour heritage through the exposition of two restored worker's apartments typical to the 1920s and 50s, and is housed in an original neo-classical building.(Foss√•skaret and Stor√•s) In a cooperation between Elkem Bj√∏lvefossen and Kvam municipality, an artist's collective was established in one of Bj√∏lvefossen's buildings. This arrangement has now expired, and its future is unclear. In a project developed in cooperation with the Bergen Academy of Art and Design, a co-localised caf√© and library was established in 2010. The village has a wealth of volunteer organisations, among them √Ölvik Rock, which stages a Rock Festival each September. After the completion of Nye Bj√∏lvo hydroelectric plant, the old funicular became obsolete. It was originally built for construction and maintenance access to the original pipes leading water from the hydroelectric reservoir to the plant, and had a maximal inclination of 61 degrees along its 1500-meter course. It was discussed whether it could be conserved as part of the region's cultural heritage and run as a tourist attraction, but this proposal failed.

It is known from one species, Broomistega putterilli, which was named in 2000. Fossils are known from the Early Triassic Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone of the Beaufort Group in the Karoo Basin of present-day South Africa, a region that had been an enclave of Gondwana. Specimens of B. putterilli were once thought to represent young individuals of another larger rhinesuchid such as Uranocentrodon, but the species is now regarded as a paedomorphic taxon, possessing the features of juvenile rhinesuchids into adulthood. In 2013, a well-preserved skeleton of Broomistega was discovered alongside the skeleton of the cynodont Thrinaxodon (a mammal relative) in a cast of a burrow. The individual probably entered the burrow while the cynodont was in a state of aestivation (dormancy), and afterwards a flash flood filled the burrow with sediment to preserve both bodies together. Paleobiology Broomistega is the only rhinesuchid known from the Triassic Period. Its presence in the Early Triassic indicates that rhinesuchids survived the Permo-Triassic Mass Extinction about 252 million years ago. However, compared to the diversity of rhinesuchids that existed in the Permian Period, Broomistega is a very rare component of the Early Triassic Karoo fauna. It may have been the last surviving representative of the group, making it a relict taxon. Association with Thrinaxodon Thrinaxodon and Broomistega found in the same burrow synchrotron imaging. The most complete skeleton of Broomistega, specimen BP/1/7200, was discovered in the sandstone cast of a burrow (BP/1/5558) after the cast was scanned at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in 2013. The cast was first found in the Karoo Basin of South Africa by paleontologist James Kitching in 1975, but was left unprepared for many years. Part of a skull of a cynodont was exposed on the surface of the cast, allowing Kitching to attribute it to the genus Thrinaxodon. Only after the synchrotron scanning was the Broomistega skeleton found. All bones are preserved except for a few phalanges of the right hind foot, and nearly all of the bones are articulated as they were in life. The skeletons do not show evidence of stiffening due to rigor mortis after death, but are pressed against the sides of the burrow as the animals would have been when alive. The skeleton of BP/1/7200 is preserved belly-up, resting on the right side of the Thrinaxodon skeleton. This position was probably the result of the individual being pushed on top of the Thrinaxodon by floodwater entering the burrow. Broomistega is not thought to have been a burrowing animal and was instead semiaquatic. The Thrinaxodon individual preserved in BP/1/5558 was probably the original occupant of the burrow, and the Broomistega individual probably entered the burrow later. The joints of BP/1/7200 are not well developed, indicating that the individual was a juvenile with large amounts of cartilage in its skeleton. Several ribs on the right side of the skeleton are broken, indicating that the individual was severely injured before entering the burrow, probably by being crushed. The animal was still alive when it entered the burrow because the rib fractures show evidence of healing, but the injury probably impacted its ability to breathe and to move about. Two holes are present on the skull roof of BP/1/7200. Although they resemble bite marks, they do not match with the teeth of the Thrinaxodon specimen. The presence of two different species of large vertebrates in the same burrow is unusual. Modern examples of this association are usually the result of predator-prey interactions (for example, a predator storing the body of its prey in the burrow) or mutualistic relationships whereby the original occupant gains protection from predators by the presence of the second inhabitant. However, the benefit of cohabitation usually only works when there are multiple burrows, casting doubt on the possibility that the Thrinaxodon was benefiting from the presence of the Broomistega. Because the Broomistega skeleton lacks any sign of damage caused by the Thrinaxodon, the two were probably not predator and prey. The most likely explanation for the association as of 2013 is that the Thrinaxodon tolerated the Broomistega or was unable to remove it, possibly because it was aestivating. As is the case with many modern amphibians, the Broomistega probably entered the burrow to seek temporary shelter. During the Early Triassic the Karoo Basin was seasonally arid, so the Thrinaxodon may have been aestivating to conserve energy during a time when resource availability was low and the normally aquatic Broomistega may have entered to burrow to escape the hot and dry conditions of its environment.

Broiliellus is most closely related to the genus Dissorophus, and both have been placed in the subfamily Dissorophinae. Broiliellus is known from five species from the Early Permian: the type species is Broiliellus texensis, and the other species are Broiliellus brevis, Broiliellus olsoni, Broiliellus arroyoensis, and Broiliellus reiszi. An additional species, Broiliellus novomexicanus, which was originally named Aspidosaurus novomexicanus, is now thought to fall outside the genus as a member of the subfamily Eucacopinae.  History of study  Broiliellus was first named by American paleontologist S.W. Williston in 1914 based on two nearly complete skulls in articulation with postcranial material from the early Permian of Texas; this species was given the name Broiliellus texensis, the genus name being for the German paleontologist Ferdinand Broili, and the species name being for the geographic provenance. The holotype is currently reposited in the Field Museum. A second species, Broiliellus brevis, from the Archer City bonebed in Texas was named in 1964 by Canadian paleontologist Robert Carroll; the holotype of this species is currently reposited in the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Two more species were named in 1967 by American paleontologist Robert DeMar, Broiliellus olsoni and Broiliellus arroyoensis, both from Texas. The most recent species to be described was Broiliellus reiszi in 2013 by Canadian paleontologist Robert Holmes and colleagues. Phylogeny The phylogenetic analysis of Schoch (2012) found that Broiliellus was most closely related to Dissorophus. However, the three species of Broiliellus did not form their own clade, but rather a polytomy (unresolved evolutionary relationship) with Dissorophus. Holmes et al. (2013) named a new species of Broiliellus, Broiliellus reiszi. They performed two phylogenetic analyses using the data matrix of Schoch (2012). This analysis yielded more resolved topology and a monophyletic Broiliellus.

It was found in Carboniferous coal from mines near the community of Kounov in the Czech Republic. Known only from a crushed skull, shoulder girdle bones, and scales, the known remains of this genus were very similar to those of Asaphestera, a more complete microsaur with a lizard-like appearance. However, this genus differs from Asaphestera due to its heavily sculptured skull, thin ventral plate of the clavicles, and a larger number of fangs on the roof of the mouth. For many years the type and only known species, Boii crassidens, was considered to be a species of Sparodus, until 1966 when Robert Carroll assigned it to its own genus.  History  The specimen now designated as Boii crassidens was first described by Antonin Friƒç, one of the most notable paleontologists in the late 19th century region of Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic). Friƒç made many contributions to knowledge of Carboniferous tetrapods during his lifetime, including a particular article published in \\"Sitzungsberichte der k√∂niglichen B√∂hmischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften in Prague\\", the most notable bohemian scientific journal of its day. The article, which was published in 1876 within volume 1875 of the journal, was a list of Carboniferous animals he and his associates recently discovered at gaskohle (bituminous coal) mines near the localities of N√Ω≈ôany and Kounov√°. His list included short preliminary descriptions for many new genera and species of tetrapods, including Microbrachis, Branchiosaurus, Hyloplesion (at that time called Stelliosaurus), and Sparodus. Most of the \\"Saurier\\" (reptiles, amphibians, or other tetrapods) he discussed in the article hailed from the N√Ω≈ôany mines, with only two diagnostic examples found within the Kounov√° mines. One of these was a supposed amphibian he designated as \\"Labyrinthodon\\" shwarzenbergii, which is now known to not be an amphibian at all, but rather an early synapsid named Macromerion. The other specimen, which is now known as Boii crassidens, he named Batrachocephalus crassidens. This specimen consisted of a crushed skull, preserved on a slab and counterslab of coal. Jaw bones, scales, and shoulder girdle elements were preserved on the slabs as well. It is currently held at the National Museum in Prague, with the designation ƒåGH 83. This article was only a preliminary review of the creatures Friƒç and his associates discovered. A more elaborate description was published in 1883 as part of a personal monograph focusing solely on the creatures discovered at these mines. This description renamed Batrachocephalus crassidens to Sparodus crassidens, as the genus name 'Batrachocephalus' was already taken by Batrachocephalus mino, an Indonesian species of catfish. Friƒç also assigned an isolated maxilla (upper jaw bone) with designation ƒåGH 124 to this species, although it was quite a bit larger than the maxilla of the crushed skull. In a 1966 review of microsaurs published by Robert Carroll, \\"Sparodus\\" crassidens was not found to be a member of the genus Sparodus. Instead, it was considered a close relative of the genus Asaphestera, within a family of early microsaurs known as the Tuditanidae. This prompted Carroll to create a new genus name for the specimens previously considered to belong to \\"Sparodus\\" crassidens. The new name he found was Boii crassidens, named after the Boii tribe which inhabited the area of Bohemia during the time of the Roman Republic.  Description   Skull  The jaws and neck of Boii illustrated by Friƒç (1883) from impressions The crushed skull was pressed between two plates of coal which preserved the outer impressions of bones on both the underside and upper side of the specimen. Although not all of the bones were preserved, the outer impressions helped to reconstruct the structure of these missing bones. The impressions were used to reconstruct the skull and lower jaws, while the skull itself (which preserved the palate better than the impressions) was removed and encased in Canada balsam. The skull was initially believed to have been stout, approximately as long as it was wide. This 'frog-like' skull is responsible for the original genus name \\"Batrachocephalus\\", which is Greek for \\"frog head\\". However, later reconstructions from Robert Carroll have interpreted this wide shape as a result of the crushing the skull experienced, with the skull actually being narrow and somewhat triangular, more similar in shape to that of a lizard rather than a frog. The structure of the skull is practically identical to that of the related genus Asaphestera in terms of how the different bones of the skull connect to each other. In addition, the orbits (eye holes) are roughly midway down the length of the skull in both. Unlike the skull of Asaphestera, which is fairly smooth, the skull of Boii is covered with numerous grooves and ridges which radiate from the middle of their respective bones. The maxillary and premaxillary bones forming the edge of the snout contained many conical teeth, about 30 per each side of the upper jaw. This is fewer than Asaphestera, but more than the eponymous tuditanid Tuditanus. These marginal (edge) teeth in general are slightly larger towards the front of the skull, although only to a small extent. The palate (roof of the mouth) also possesses teeth. The palatine bones, positioned right next to the maxillae, possess a fair number of teeth. The most notable assortment of palatal teeth are a bundle of large fangs preserved midway down the skull. Large palatal fangs are also shared by Sparodus, explaining how Boii crassidens was once considered to be part of that genus. Friƒç (1883) considered these fangs to have grown out of the vomers (from the front of the skull) or possibly the parasphenoid (from the back of the skull), but Carroll (1966) reconstructed the fangs as being part of the long pterygoid bones, which were originally reported as being toothless. This is consistent with the relationship between Boii and Asaphestera, as the latter possessed two fangs along the outer edge of each pterygoid about midway down the skull. The dentaries (main bones of the lower jaws) are also preserved and covered with teeth similar to those of the upper jaws. A row of small pits run from the symphysis (chin) along the upper portion of the outer face of the bones. This characteristic is also shared by Asaphestera.  Other bones  Some bones of the shoulder girdle are known. A pair of V-shaped bones are preserved behind the skull, which Friƒç (1883) identified as coracoids. However, research by Carroll has indicated that microsaurs did not possess coracoid bones, and that the bones identified by Friƒç were actually clavicles. Clavicles possess two blade-like regions pointing away from each other at right angles when seen from the front. The lower regions point inwards and laying along the chest and the upper regions point upwards along the sides of the body. The lower regions (a.k.a. ventral plates) of Boii's clavicles are very thin, like those of a reptile. This notably contrasts with those of Asaphestera, which had massive arrow-shaped ventral plates. As typical for many tetrapods, Boii also possessed an interclavicle which was positioned behind the clavicles at the center of the chest. However, the only remnant of this bone in the specimen is a large yet indistinct impression. A single arm bone was also present on the specimen, although paleontologists disagree whether it was a humerus (according to Friƒç, 1883) or a radius or ulna (according to Carroll, 1966). Boii possessed large scales, as preserved in the only known specimen. The scales of the back of the animal were tile-like with rounded corners. They tightly overlapped in alternating rows, and each possessed a bulging rear edge. The scales of the belly of the animal were also overlapping. However, these belly scales were wider than the back scales, and their rows were stacked so frequently that only a small portion of each individual scale is visible.  Classification  In life, Boii may have been similar in appearance to members of this genus, Tuditanus Friƒç (1883) considered Boii crassidens to be a member of the family Branchiosauridae, along with other species of Sparodus. Branchiosaurids, a group of small gilled temnospondyls, are now believed to be only distant relatives of Sparodus and Boii. In 1894, John William Dawson listed the three Sparodus species as microsaurs rather than branchiosaurids. He did not explicitly note each individual species (instead clumping them as \\"Sparodus sp.\\"), because he was unsure whether they were all valid members of the same genus. Dawson's suspicions were rectified in 1966, when Carroll split Boii crassidens off of Sparodus. The skull structure of Boii was very similar to that Asaphestera (which itself was similar to Tuditanus), so he placed Boii along with Asaphestera in Tuditanidae. Tuditanids were basal microsaurs, which did not evolve the unusual adaptations of more advanced families of microsaurs. They were terrestrial, lizard-like creatures with well-developed legs and jaw joints set about as far back as the neck joint. Although Boii crassidens was quite old by microsaur standards, it is one of the last known species of tuditanids. Carroll (1966) supposed that it was possible that it descended from Asaphestera, one of the earliest known microsaurs to have evolved.

At an elevation of , its surface area is . History A Slavic fortification stood at the mouth of the Rhin on the northern shore. In the 12th century, the German settlement of Ruppin (now called Altruppin) was established next to it. A few decades later, Neuruppin was established on the southwest shore. A mill was built in Altfriesack, between the Ruppiner See and the B√ºtzsee next to the Slavic settlement of Wustrau. The latter is probably the oldest settlement on the lake. Around the lake are other villages, which mostly now belong to the municipality of Neuruppin. Wustrau and Altfriesack now form one division in the municipality of Fehrbellin. Economic and strategic importance The lake was strategically important as it was the center of the Slavic area. It was also of economic importance due to its fisheries and for transportation. The building of the Ruppiner Canal in 1788 increased its importance, as it was then connected to the Havel and thereby with Berlin. Since 1898, a railroad causeway on the Kremmen‚ÄìWittstock line has cut the lake in two, 2.5 km from the north shore running east and west. Today, the Ruppiner See is the reservoir for the wetlands known as the Rhinluch. Until the beginning of May, water is held there from the spring runoff. It is then released over the locks in Alt Friesack to prevent the wetlands from drying out. The management of this runoff has the potential for political conflict.

Although it was first classified as a reptile, Batropetes is now known to be a genus of microsaur amphibians. Batropetes lived during the Sakmarian stage of the Early Permian. Fossils attributable to the type species B. fritschi have been collected from the town of Freital in Saxony, Germany, near the city of Dresden. Additional material has been found from the Saar-Nahe Basin in southwestern Germany and has been assigned to three additional species: B. niederkirchensis, B. palatinus, and B. appelensis. Description Fossil Batropetes is small and short-bodied for a microsaur. Its average total body length was about . The orbits are large and the skull is short. Batropetes possesses scales on its underside that are similar to those of reptiles. Batropetes is distinguished from Carrolla, another brachystelechid microsaur, by the presence of three cusps on the premaxillary and anterior dentary teeth. In Carrolla, there are only two cusps. Additional diagnostic features seen in Batropetes include a supraoccipital bone that is not fused to the otic capsule, the presence of a retroarticular process (a projection at the back of the lower jaw), and two proximal bones in the tarsus. Classification The first known material now attributed to the genus Batropetes was originally referred to the genus Hyloplesion in 1882. Several specimens from Freital were described under the name Hyloplesion Fritschi as small non-labyrinthodonts. Three years later, the specimens originally referred to as Hyloplesion Fritschi were reassigned by Carl Hermann Credner to the genus Hylonomus under the name Hylonomus fritschia. Newly discovered specimens of other forms from the same locality led Credner to believe that two taxa existed. He named one, an amphibian, Hylonomus geinitzi, and the other, a reptile, Petrobates truncatus. Later preparation of the material examined by Credner through a technique of removing the soft bone from the surrounding matrix mechanically and casting the cavities in liquid latex has revealed more anatomical detail suggesting that three taxa were present in Freital, not two. A specimen previously referred to Petrobates truncatus was first considered by Robert L. Carroll and Pamela Gaskill in 1978 to be a microsaur rather than a reptile. It was considered distinct from Petrobates, then considered a captorhinomorph, based only on the structure of the atlas. Of the three species represented in Frietal, Hylonomus geinitzi, as described by Credner, has since been reassigned to the microsaur genus Saxonerpeton, and Petrobates truncatus was designated as Batropetes truncatus by Carroll and Gaskill in 1971. Carroll and Gaskill still referred to B. truncatus as a captorhinomorph reptile. Carroll and Gaskill described a new microsaur in 1978 from Frietal, which they called Brachystelechus fritschi. It was noted that the skull of Brachystelechus bore a striking resemblance to that of Batropetes, which was considered to be unrelated. It differed from Batropetes in that it possessed an internarial bone which was not seen in known specimens of Batropetes. A newly discovered specimen of microsaur from the Saar-Nahe district in southwestern Germany has confirmed that Brachystelechus and Batropetes represent the same species. The characters that previously distinguished the two genera from one another are all found in one specimen, known as SMNS 55884, housed in the Staatliches Museum f√ºr Naturkunde Stuttgart. This a complete specimen preserved in ventral view and consisting of a part and counterpart. The skull roof was examined by excavating the matrix from the top of the block and exposing more anatomical features. The occipital condyle in SMNS 55884, not noticeable in the specimen of Brachystelechus, clearly indicates that it is a microsaur rather than a captorhinomorph reptile. An interfrontal bone is seen in material once referred to Brachystelechus but not in any material known from specimens previously attributed to Batropetes. This may be a result of poor preservation, or perhaps intraspecific variation. The parietals of the specimen are wide and the skull is short, both of which are features that associate it with the North American genera Carrolla and Quasicaecilia. On the basis of these and other similarities, Carroll, who described the new material in 1991, constructed a new microbrachomorph family called the Brachystelechidae to include Batropetes, Carrolla, and Quasicaecilia. A 2013 study of Batropetes erected a new species, Batropetes niederkirchensis, for specimen SMNS 55884. SMNS 55884 was noted to differ from the type specimen of B. fritschi in the number of presacral vertebrae, the width between the eye sockets, the shape of the prefrontal, postorbital, and scapulocoracoid bones, and the position of the obturator foramen in the hips. Two additional species, B. appelensis and B. palatinus, were named in 2015 on the basis of new material found from the Saar-Nahe Basin. Notes 1.

At an elevation of 30 m, its surface area is . The Elfrather lake, popularly known as E for short-sea, is located in the north east of the city of Krefeld on the border of the Elfrath district. The lake was created from a disused gravel pit, which has been filled with groundwater. The degradation was made in the Lower Rhine because of the low water level with typical wetness reduction construction of a dredger. The gravel was taken up in the 1970s for the construction of the A57 Highway, which was set up for the gravel pit as a place of central material supply. After the completion of the lake from the 1970s, it was expanded to its today's recreational area with many spacious lawns. The lake is now Elfrather primarily a long race track. Swimming in the lake is actually banned because of boat traffic. There is a swimming lake next to the regatta course created specifically.

The type species is Cryobatrachus kitchingi. It is known from a partial skull and an imprint of the skull roof, both found in the Fremouw Formation of the Transantarctic Mountains at about 85¬∞ south latitude and described in 1974. Many small bone fragments have also been identified, although they cannot be attributed with certainty to C. kitchingi. Cryobatrachus has been classified in the family Lydekkerinidae, as it is similar in appearance to the genus Lydekkerina from South Africa. Because only a small number of features distinguish it from other lydekkerinids, Cryobatrachus kitchingi has more recently been considered a nomen dubium, meaning that its distinction from other better-known species may be unwarranted. Discovery and specimens James Kitching, the discoverer of Cryobatrachus and the namesake of its type species, C. kitchingi Fossils of Cryobatrachus were first found by South African paleontologist James Kitching in the austral summer of 1971‚Äì72 as part of an expedition headed by the Institute for Polar Studies at Ohio State University, now known as the Byrd Polar Research Center. Paleontologists Edwin Harris Colbert of the American Museum of Natural History and John Cosgriff of Wayne State University described these fossils in 1974, positing the new genus and species Cryobatrachus kitchingi with the specific name honoring Kitching. All specimens were uncovered from the lower part of the Fremouw Formation, which dates back to the Early Triassic. The holotype specimen, cataloged as AMNH 9503, is a partial skull with the ventral surface of the dermal bones present. The palate and braincase are not preserved. An additional paratype specimen called AMNH 9556 includes an impression of the skull roof, but no preserved bones. AMNH 9503 was found on Kitching Ridge (which is also named after James Kitching) near Shackleton Glacier, and AMNH 9556 was found on Mount Kenyon near McGregor Glacier. Two crushed skulls from Kitching Ridge were also considered possible specimens of Cryobatrachus, as was part of an upper jaw from Halfmoon Bluff (which is on the opposite side of Shackleton Glacier as Kitching Ridge). Colbert and Cosgriff tentatively attributed six smaller fragments from Coalsack Bluff to Cryobatrachus, including parts of lower jaw, the clavicle, and the interclavicle. Fifteen other Coalsack Bluff fragments, attributed as possible remains of Cryobatrachus based on their small size alone, were described. These bones included parts of the legs, hips, vertebrae, and skull. A 1977-78 expedition found a bone fragment on Collinson Ridge and an interclavicle on Shenk Peak southeast of the paratype locality on Mount Kenyon, both of which were referred to Cryobatrachus in 1984. Description While most temnospondyls are characterized by features on the upper surface of the skull roof or the palate, only the underside of the skull roof is exposed in the holotype of Cryobatrachus. This part of the skull is not very well known in other temnospondyls, since it is normally hidden by the palate. The rock encasing the upper surface of the holotype skull was not removed because of time constraints during the 1971-72 expedition and fear that the specimen might be damaged. Cryobatrachus is most similar in appearance to the temnospondyl Lydekkerina from South Africa, and to several other temnospondyls in the family Lydekkerinidae such as Limnoiketes. In all of these temnospondyls, the eye sockets are closer to the tip of the snout than they are to the back of the skull. The skull of Cryobatrachus is about long, smaller than those of Lydekkerina, which are normally long. Unlike Lydekkerina, Cryobatrachus has a slightly oval-shaped skull that is widest near its middle rather than at the very back. The eye sockets are spaced closer together than they are in Lydekkerina. The parietal foramen, a small hole at the top of the skull behind the eyes, is oval-shaped rather than circular as in most other temnospondyls. A space in the squamosal bone called the otic notch extends far into the skull, as in other lydekkerinids and a similar group of Triassic temnospondyls called rhinesuchids. However, the notch in Cryobatrachus is unusual in that it is crescent- rather than oval-shaped and that it ends in a sharp point rather than a rounded margin. Cryobatrachus can be distinguished from another group of Triassic temnospondyls called capitosaurians in that its quadratojugal bones (which make up the back of the upper jaws) end at the level of the tabular horns (which project from the back of the skull roof). In most capitosaurians, the quadratojugals extend past the tabular horns. As is the case in other lydekkerinids, Cryobatrachus lacks the deep grooves on the skull that support a lateral line sensory system in other temnospondyls. The paratype specimen of Cryobatrachus shows that the upper surface of the skull was covered in small pits, with only a shallow groove running between the eye sockets. The lack of a lateral line system in Cryobatrachus and other lydekkerinids is usually taken as evidence that they spent most of their time on land, since lateral lines are typically only present in aquatic animals that use them to detect vibrations in water.

The original generic name of this frog was Cordicephalus Nevo (1968); however, this generic name turned out to be preoccupied by a cestode genus Cordicephalus Wardle, McLeod & Stewart (1947), which remains nomenclaturally available in spite of being considered a junior synonym of the diphyllobothriid genus Pyramicocephalus. Mahony (2019) coined a replacement name Nevobatrachus. Fossils of N. gracilis were found in a lacustrine deposit in Makhtesh Ramon called \\"Amphibian Hill\\" and it is believed they lived during the Lower Cretaceous. When first described by Eviatar Nevo of the University of Haifa (in 1968) the genus Cordicephalus was thought to contain two species, C. gracilis and C. longicostatus. Since then it was redescribed and it was determined that N. gracilis was the only species in the genus. Etymology The original genus' name derives from the Latin cordi (cor meaning heart) and cephalus (meaning head). The name comes from the heart-like shape of its skull. The species name, gracilis, comes from the Latin for slender. The replacement generic name is derived from the surname of Eviatar Nevo and from batrachus, a Greek word for a frog. Description Like its close relatives, N. gracilis was fairly small, about in length. It had a flat skull which was almost as wide as it was long, features usually found in aquatic animals. Other features that support that view that N. gracilis had a mainly aquatic lifestyle is its short axial column as well as large foot bones which may imply extensive webbing.

It would have reached about 1 m (3.2 ft) in length.http://www.palaeocritti.com/by- group/colosteoidea/colosteus It was originally described by John Strong Newberry in 1856 as a new species of the palaeonisciform fish genus Pygopterus. In 1869, Edward Drinker Cope erected a new genus of \\"batrachian\\", Colosteus, containing the species C. crassicutatus, C. foveatus, and C. marshii, based on Linton material lent to him by Newberry. Cope later realized that the holotype of his Colosteus crassicutatus was also the holotype of Newberry's earlier Pygopterus scutellatus, and combined the two as Colosteus scutellatus. Colosteus foveatus was later determined to be a junior synonym of Isodectes obtusus, and Colosteus marshii was given its own genus, Ptyonius  References  Category:Extinct animals of the United States Category:Carboniferous tetrapods of North America Category:Fossil taxa described in 1871 Category:Taxa named by Edward Drinker Cope ","title":"Colosteus"},{"id":"21577060","text":"Coloraderpeton is an extinct genus of a√Østopod lepospondyl within the family Oestocephalidae.

It was named in 1986 by American paleontologists Wann Langston and Everett Olson. The type species, Carrolla craddocki, is the only known species.  History of study  Carrolla was named for the type species by Langston & Olson (1986) for a single, complete skull collected from the early Permian of Archer County, Texas; the specimen is reposited at the Texas Memorial Museum in Austin. They immediately recognized the similarity to 'Brachystelechus,' the eponymous genus from Europe; this genus was subsequently synonymized with Batropetes, traditionally considered a reptile but which had taxonomic precedent. Numerous features were cited as evidence for an ability to burrow, which was considered rare among 'microsaurs' at the time, and several shared features with modern amphibians were noted, although some of these have been subsequently disproven. Maddin et al. (2011) provided a detailed re-description of the holotype based on CT data; this study was one of the first to explore 'microsaur' anatomy using tomographic methods. These authors provided substantial new information on the internal anatomy, particularly the braincase, and recovered support for close affinities of brachystelechids and caecilians in the longstanding debate over the origin of modern amphibians. Mann et al. (2019) reported the first postcrania of the taxon based on a small block that was catalogued with the holotype skull but never described; the authors indicate that correspondence with K.W. Craddock, who found the holotype, corroborates that the postcrania block was recovered in association with the skull. The authors also validated Glienke's (2015) previous cursory interpretation of at least some of the teeth as tricuspid, a feature found in some other brachystelechids.  Anatomy  The most recent diagnosis was provided by Maddin et al. (2011) and includes features such as a short, wide skull with a well-ossified anterior braincase. Some of the diagnostic features have been shown to be shared with other taxa following similar CT analyses of additional 'microsaurs'; more recent work on other brachystelechids including Glienke (2015) and Pardo et al. (2015) have provided additional features that separate those taxa from Carrolla. For example, both Quasicaecilia and Carrolla share extensively ossified posterior braincases and anterior braincases, but the morphology of some features, such as the element termed the 'presphenoid' by Pardo et al. differs between them. The presence of bicuspid teeth was reported by Langston & Olson, a feature of great interest because it has traditionally been considered to be a feature linking them to modern amphibians, the only living tetrapods with bicuspid teeth, but subsequent workers identified tricuspidity in the holotype.

It is situated on the northeastern Carpathians, along the upper Tisa River; it covers the Maramure»ô Depression and the surrounding Carpathian mountains. Alternatively, the term Maramure»ô is also used for the Maramure»ô County of Romania, which contains the southern section of the historical region. Name in other languages Alternative names for Maramure»ô include (Marmaroshchyna), (Maramoro≈°), (Marmarosh), , , , and . Geography Maramure»ô is a valley enclosed by mountains Oa»ô, Gut√¢i, »öible»ô and Rodnei (northern section of the Inner Eastern Carpathians) to the west and south, Maramure»ô Mountains and central section of the Outer Eastern Carpathians to the east and north, with a thin opening at Khust. Several dozen small mountain rivers and creeks flow into the river Tisa. It is forested and not easily accessible. The limits of the region are between the parallels of 47¬∞33' N and 40¬∞02' N and the meridians of 23¬∞15' E and 25¬∞03' E. Maramure»ô represents one of the largest depressions in the Carpathians, covering an area of about 10,000 km¬≤. Its length from Khust to Prislop Pass is about 150 km and width from North to South is up to 80 km. The main mountain passes linking Maramure»ô with the neighboring regions are high and in the past were hardly accessible in the winter. Prislop Pass (1,414 m high) links the region in the east towards Moldavia, Dealul »òtefƒÉni»õei (1,254 m) in the south towards Transylvania, Pintea Pass (987 m) towards Baia Mare, and FƒÉrgƒÉu (587 m) in the west towards Oa»ô Country, while Frasini Pass (Yasinia; 931 m) links the region in the north to Galicia. The mountains surrounding this region occupy more than half of the area. A few peaks reach above 2,000 m, such as Pietrosul (2,303 m) in the Rodnei Mountains to the south and Hov√¢rla (2,061 m) in Muntele Negru (Cernahora) to the north. The heavy forested mountains sustain many protected species of plants, such as yew (Taxus baccata), larch (Larix decidua), Swiss pine (Pinus cembra), edelweiss (Leontopodium alpinum); and animals, such as lynx (Lynx lynx), chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), alpine marmot (Marmota marmota), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), and capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus). The last wisent from present-day Romania territory, a symbol of Maramure≈ü, was hunted to extinction in 1852. Lostri≈£a, a local variety of salmon, still live in the mountain rivers. Several protected areas have been created in Maramure»ô. Rodnei Mountains National Park was designated in 1930, Maramure»ô Mountains Natural Park in 2004, and there are many other caves, gorges, cliff formations, and lakes which are officially-protected areas. History Marmaroscher Comitat on the map of the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, 1780-84. The present-day borders of Romania are projected to the historical map. M√°ramaros County (Hungarian: M√°ramaros v√°rmegye; Romanian: Comitatul Maramure≈ü; Ukrainian: –ö–æ–º—ñ—Ç–∞—Ç –ú–∞—Ä–∞–º–∞—Ä–æ—à), 1905 In ancient times, this area was settled by Celts, Dacians, Sarmatians and Germanic peoples. In the first century BC, it was part of the Dacian Kingdom under Burebista, while in the early Middle Ages, it was ruled by the Hunnic Empire, the Kingdom of the Gepids, the Kingdom of the Avars, the White Croatia and the Kievan Rus'. The territory was part of the Kingdom of Hungary from the 11th century and was nominally divided between the Gyep≈± border region, comitatus of Szatm√°r and comitatus of Borsova. Later, the whole region was included into the comitatus of M√°ramaros. Initially, the inhabitants of the region were allowed to preserve their native political organization, the Voevodates, which formed many small autonomous areas. The King long struggled to convince the Voivodes to accept the title of Count, with the implied losing independence in political and financial matters. During the Middle Ages, the people in many mountain villages, where each family by definition had a considerable domain, were called name≈üi, meaning free peasants taking pride in their family (the origin of the word is disputed, in the Kingdom of Hungary, free people possessing land were called \\"nemes\\" in Hungarian, in Romanian neam means extended family). In the 16th century, medieval Kingdom of Hungary was invaded and destroyed by the Ottoman Empire, and area came under administration of the semi-independent Ottoman Principality of Transylvania and later (in the end of the 17th century) under administration of the Habsburg Monarchy (later known as the Austrian Empire). During Habsburg administration, region was firstly part of the Habsburg Principality of Transylvania, but was later (in 1732) included into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. In 1867, the Austrian Empire was transformed into the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary and the region was included into the Transleithania or Hungarian part of the Monarchy. After the First World War, the region was divided between Romania and Czechoslovakia at the territory of Hutsul Republic,Hutsul coup. The Ukrainian Week. November 14, 2010 while in 1940 the whole area became part of Hungary again and was controlled during World War II until 1944. After World War II, the southern section remained within the Romanian borders and is now part of Maramure»ô County; the northern section was incorporated into the Soviet Union and is now part of Zakarpattia Oblast of independent Ukraine. People In the southern area, the majority of the population are Romanians. There are also some Hungarians, Rusyns (Ukrainians), Zipser Germans, Jews, and Roma. In the northern area, the majority are Ruthenes, with smaller Romanian, Hungarian and German communities. In the northern area most people speak the Ruthene language, while in the southern area most speak Romanian, which is why the region was split into two parts. Since the 1940s there have been villages cut in two by the state border. There are some villages in the north (within Ukraine) that have a sizeable Romanian population, as well as some villages in Romania that have a sizeable Ukrainian population.
