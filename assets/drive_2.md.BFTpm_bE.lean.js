They were created by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank and first appeared in Action Comics #859 (January, 2008) as enemies of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Fictional team history The Justice League of Earth is a group of super-powered humans living on 31st Century Earth. They all auditioned for the Legion of Super-Heroes, but were rejected due to their powers being judged to be ineffective in battle. However, it was later revealed that they were actually rejected as telepathic probing revealed deep-rooted psychosis issues that would have made them potential threats. Over the time their powers mutated turning them all into considerable threats. These individuals fell under the sway of Earth-Man and his xenophobic claims that Superman was a native of Earth who worked hard to protect the planet from alien threats, in which purportedly one of Superman's greatest achievements is protecting the planet from the dreaded Martian Manhunter.Action Comics #859. DC Comics. The Justice League of Earth spread their ideals of distrust and hatred against aliens across Earth and were able to successfully convince the planet's inhabitants into believing them, resulting in the planet falling under the dictatorship of Earth-Man, seceding from the United Planets, and a massive persecution of aliens among Earth's people. The Legion of Super-Heroes were also branded as fugitives for perpetuating the \\"lies\\" of Superman's true origins in which the Justice League of Earth was tasked into hunting them down. The Justice League of Earth captured many Legion members and this allowed them to have their powers absorbed by Earth-Man, and he used the Legionnaire Sun Boy to turn many of the suns in the galaxy red. The Legion was being hunted by Earth-Man and his villainous cohorts, who had dubbed themselves the \\"Justice League of Earth\\". After telling the Legionnaires that Brainiac 5 sent him here, Superman, Dawnstar, Colossal Boy, and Wildfire head to his likely location: an alien holding camp. Superman and the others encounter two more Legionnaires: Night Girl and Shadow Lass, who lead them to an improvised underground headquarters from which over ten thousand extraterrestrials have escaped to their home planets. Timber Wolf and Lightning Lass are revealed to be running the interstellar \\"underground railroad\\". After a short reunion, Superman and his Legionnaire friends are discovered by Earth-Man and are attacked by the Justice League of Earth. Wildfire, Dawnstar, Colossal Boy, and Superman manage to escape through a warp-gate to Colu, where they crash land, and are attacked by the seemingly brainwashed residents. After blacking out, Superman awakens and is confronted by Brainiac 5, who reveals that his dictatorship of the planet is fabricated as a way to keep Colu, which is the strategic beachhead of a proposed United Planets attack on Earth, from completing their plans.Action Comics #860. DC Comics. On Earth, Chameleon Girl sneaks into the Justice League's headquarters. She discovers that they captured Sun Boy and placed him into a machine that uses his powers to tint the sun red. Superman, Brainiac 5, and Colossal Boy find the other Legionnaires and the crystal data tablet containing the false claims regarding Superman's origins.Action Comics #861. DC Comics. Earth-Man reveals himself, steals Colossal Boy's power, and proceeds to attack Superman, gloating about how he has forever ruined Superman's name. Superman takes the fight outside the station and pushes Earth-Man into outer space. Meanwhile, the attack force of the United Planets waits for the signal to attack Earth.Action Comics #862. DC Comics. Brainiac 5 manages to free Sun Boy from the machine. Once he returns to consciousness, Earth's sun once again emits yellow rays, restoring Superman's powers. The Man of Steel is then able to face Earth-Man on equal footing, convincing Earth's people of the truth of his origins in the process. With the Legion's help, Superman is able to subdue Earth-Man. With the Justice League of Earth defeated, the Legion set about rebuilding and making plans to find their lost teammates. Before leaving for his era, Superman tells the Legion to let him know when they need his help. The Justice League of Earth were defeated and imprisoned on the prison planet Takron-Galtos.Action Comics #863. DC Comics.

Digestion involves the breakdown of food into smaller and smaller components, until they can be absorbed and assimilated into the body. The process of digestion has three stages. The first stage is the cephalic phase of digestion which begins with gastric secretions in response to the sight and smell of food. This stage includes the mechanical breakdown of food by chewing, and the chemical breakdown by digestive enzymes, that takes place in the mouth. Saliva contains digestive enzymes called amylase, and lingual lipase, secreted by the salivary glands and serous glands on the tongue. The enzymes start to break down the food in the mouth. Chewing, in which the food is mixed with saliva, begins the mechanical process of digestion. This produces a bolus which can be swallowed down the esophagus to enter the stomach. In the stomach the gastric phase of digestion takes place. The food is further broken down by mixing with gastric acid until it passes into the duodenum, in the third intestinal phase of digestion, where it is mixed with a number of enzymes produced by the pancreas. Digestion is helped by the chewing of food carried out by the muscles of mastication, the tongue, and the teeth, and also by the contractions of peristalsis, and segmentation. Gastric acid, and the production of mucus in the stomach, are essential for the continuation of digestion. Peristalsis is the rhythmic contraction of muscles that begins in the esophagus and continues along the wall of the stomach and the rest of the gastrointestinal tract. This initially results in the production of chyme which when fully broken down in the small intestine is absorbed as chyle into the lymphatic system. Most of the digestion of food takes place in the small intestine. Water and some minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon of the large intestine. The waste products of digestion (feces) are defecated from the anus via the rectum. Components Adult digestive systemThere are several organs and other components involved in the digestion of food. The organs known as the accessory digestive organs are the liver, gall bladder and pancreas. Other components include the mouth, salivary glands, tongue, teeth and epiglottis. The largest structure of the digestive system is the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). This starts at the mouth and ends at the anus, covering a distance of about nine (9) metres. The largest part of the GI tract is the colon or large intestine. Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste matter is stored prior to defecation. Most of the digestion of food takes place in the small intestine which is the longest part of the GI tract. A major digestive organ is the stomach. Within its mucosa are millions of embedded gastric glands. Their secretions are vital to the functioning of the organ. There are many specialised cells of the GI tract. These include the various cells of the gastric glands, taste cells, pancreatic duct cells, enterocytes and microfold cells. Some parts of the digestive system are also part of the excretory system, including the large intestine. =Mouth= 3D Medical Illustration Explaining Oral Digestive System The mouth is the first part of the upper gastrointestinal tract and is equipped with several structures that begin the first processes of digestion. These include salivary glands, teeth and the tongue. The mouth consists of two regions; the vestibule and the oral cavity proper. The vestibule is the area between the teeth, lips and cheeks, and the rest is the oral cavity proper. Most of the oral cavity is lined with oral mucosa, a mucous membrane that produces a lubricating mucus, of which only a small amount is needed. Mucous membranes vary in structure in the different regions of the body but they all produce a lubricating mucus, which is either secreted by surface cells or more usually by underlying glands. The mucous membrane in the mouth continues as the thin mucosa which lines the bases of the teeth. The main component of mucus is a glycoprotein called mucin and the type secreted varies according to the region involved. Mucin is viscous, clear, and clinging. Underlying the mucous membrane in the mouth is a thin layer of smooth muscle tissue and the loose connection to the membrane gives it its great elasticity. It covers the cheeks, inner surfaces of the lips, and floor of the mouth, and the mucin produced is highly protective against tooth decay. The roof of the mouth is termed the palate and it separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity. The palate is hard at the front of the mouth since the overlying mucosa is covering a plate of bone; it is softer and more pliable at the back being made of muscle and connective tissue, and it can move to swallow food and liquids. The soft palate ends at the uvula.Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2007, page 321 The surface of the hard palate allows for the pressure needed in eating food, to leave the nasal passage clear. The opening between the lips is termed the oral fissure, and the opening into the throat is called the fauces. At either side of the soft palate are the palatoglossus muscles which also reach into regions of the tongue. These muscles raise the back of the tongue and also close both sides of the fauces to enable food to be swallowed. Mucus helps in the mastication of food in its ability to soften and collect the food in the formation of the bolus. Salivary glands The main salivary glands There are three pairs of main salivary glands and between 800 and 1,000 minor salivary glands, all of which mainly serve the digestive process, and also play an important role in the maintenance of dental health and general mouth lubrication, without which speech would be impossible.Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 275-276 The main glands are all exocrine glands, secreting via ducts. All of these glands terminate in the mouth. The largest of these are the parotid glands‚Äîtheir secretion is mainly serous. The next pair are underneath the jaw, the submandibular glands, these produce both serous fluid and mucus. The serous fluid is produced by serous glands in these salivary glands which also produce lingual lipase. They produce about 70% of the oral cavity saliva. The third pair are the sublingual glands located underneath the tongue and their secretion is mainly mucous with a small percentage of saliva. Within the oral mucosa, and also on the tongue, palates, and floor of the mouth, are the minor salivary glands; their secretions are mainly mucous and they are innervated by the facial nerve (CN7).Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck, Fehrenbach and Herring, Elsevier, 2012, p. 157 The glands also secrete amylase a first stage in the breakdown of food acting on the carbohydrate in the food to transform the starch content into maltose. There are other serous glands on the surface of the tongue that encircle taste buds on the back part of the tongue and these also produce lingual lipase. Lipase is a digestive enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of lipids (fats). These glands are termed Von Ebner's glands which have also been shown to have another function in the secretion of histatins which offer an early defense (outside of the immune system) against microbes in food, when it makes contact with these glands on the tongue tissue. Sensory information can stimulate the secretion of saliva providing the necessary fluid for the tongue to work with and also to ease swallowing of the food. =Saliva= Saliva moistens and softens food, and along with the chewing action of the teeth, transforms the food into a smooth bolus. The bolus is further helped by the lubrication provided by the saliva in its passage from the mouth into the esophagus. Also of importance is the presence in saliva of the digestive enzymes amylase and lipase. Amylase starts to work on the starch in carbohydrates, breaking it down into the simple sugars of maltose and dextrose that can be further broken down in the small intestine. Saliva in the mouth can account for 30% of this initial starch digestion. Lipase starts to work on breaking down fats. Lipase is further produced in the pancreas where it is released to continue this digestion of fats. The presence of salivary lipase is of prime importance in young babies whose pancreatic lipase has yet to be developed. As well as its role in supplying digestive enzymes, saliva has a cleansing action for the teeth and mouth. It also has an immunological role in supplying antibodies to the system, such as immunoglobulin A. This is seen to be key in preventing infections of the salivary glands, importantly that of parotitis. Saliva also contains a glycoprotein called haptocorrin which is a binding protein to vitamin B12. It binds with the vitamin in order to carry it safely through the acidic content of the stomach. When it reaches the duodenum, pancreatic enzymes break down the glycoprotein and free the vitamin which then binds with intrinsic factor. Tongue 240pxFood enters the mouth where the first stage in the digestive process takes place, with the action of the tongue and the secretion of saliva. The tongue is a fleshy and muscular sensory organ, and the very first sensory information is received via the taste buds in the papillae on its surface. If the taste is agreeable, the tongue will go into action, manipulating the food in the mouth which stimulates the secretion of saliva from the salivary glands. The liquid quality of the saliva will help in the softening of the food and its enzyme content will start to break down the food whilst it is still in the mouth. The first part of the food to be broken down is the starch of carbohydrates (by the enzyme amylase in the saliva). The tongue is attached to the floor of the mouth by a ligamentous band called the frenum and this gives it great mobility for the manipulation of food (and speech); the range of manipulation is optimally controlled by the action of several muscles and limited in its external range by the stretch of the frenum. The tongue's two sets of muscles, are four intrinsic muscles that originate in the tongue and are involved with its shaping, and four extrinsic muscles originating in bone that are involved with its movement. =Taste= Cross section of circumvallate papilla showing arrangement of nerves and taste buds Taste is a form of chemoreception that takes place in the specialised taste receptors, contained in structures called taste buds in the mouth. Taste buds are mainly on the upper surface (dorsum) of the tongue. The function of taste perception is vital to help prevent harmful or rotten foods from being consumed. There are also taste buds on the epiglottis and upper part of the esophagus. The taste buds are innervated by a branch of the facial nerve the chorda tympani, and the glossopharyngeal nerve. Taste messages are sent via these cranial nerves to the brain. The brain can distinguish between the chemical qualities of the food. The five basic tastes are referred to as those of saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness, and umami. The detection of saltiness and sourness enables the control of salt and acid balance. The detection of bitterness warns of poisons‚Äîmany of a plant's defences are of poisonous compounds that are bitter. Sweetness guides to those foods that will supply energy; the initial breakdown of the energy-giving carbohydrates by salivary amylase creates the taste of sweetness since simple sugars are the first result. The taste of umami is thought to signal protein-rich food. Sour tastes are acidic which is often found in bad food. The brain has to decide very quickly whether the food should be eaten or not. It was the findings in 1991, describing the first olfactory receptors that helped to prompt the research into taste. The olfactory receptors are located on cell surfaces in the nose which bind to chemicals enabling the detection of smells. It is assumed that signals from taste receptors work together with those from the nose, to form an idea of complex food flavours. Teeth Teeth are complex structures made of materials specific to them. They are made of a bone-like material called dentin, which is covered by the hardest tissue in the body‚Äîenamel. Teeth have different shapes to deal with different aspects of mastication employed in tearing and chewing pieces of food into smaller and smaller pieces. This results in a much larger surface area for the action of digestive enzymes. The teeth are named after their particular roles in the process of mastication‚Äîincisors are used for cutting or biting off pieces of food; canines, are used for tearing, premolars and molars are used for chewing and grinding. Mastication of the food with the help of saliva and mucus results in the formation of a soft bolus which can then be swallowed to make its way down the upper gastrointestinal tract to the stomach. The digestive enzymes in saliva also help in keeping the teeth clean by breaking down any lodged food particles. Epiglottis 200px The epiglottis is a flap of elastic cartilage attached to the entrance of the larynx. It is covered with a mucous membrane and there are taste buds on its lingual surface which faces into the mouth. Its laryngeal surface faces into the larynx. The epiglottis functions to guard the entrance of the glottis, the opening between the vocal folds. It is normally pointed upward during breathing with its underside functioning as part of the pharynx, but during swallowing, the epiglottis folds down to a more horizontal position, with its upper side functioning as part of the pharynx. In this manner it prevents food from going into the trachea and instead directs it to the esophagus, which is behind. During swallowing, the backward motion of the tongue forces the epiglottis over the glottis' opening to prevent any food that is being swallowed from entering the larynx which leads to the lungs; the larynx is also pulled upwards to assist this process. Stimulation of the larynx by ingested matter produces a strong cough reflex in order to protect the lungs. =Pharynx= The pharynx is a part of the conducting zone of the respiratory system and also a part of the digestive system. It is the part of the throat immediately behind the nasal cavity at the back of the mouth and above the esophagus and larynx. The pharynx is made up of three parts. The lower two parts‚Äîthe oropharynx and the laryngopharynx are involved in the digestive system. The laryngopharynx connects to the esophagus and it serves as a passageway for both air and food. Air enters the larynx anteriorly but anything swallowed has priority and the passage of air is temporarily blocked. The pharynx is innervated by the pharyngeal plexus of the vagus nerve. Muscles in the pharynx push the food into the esophagus. The pharynx joins the esophagus at the oesophageal inlet which is located behind the cricoid cartilage. =Esophagus= The esophagus, commonly known as the foodpipe or gullet, consists of a muscular tube through which food passes from the pharynx to the stomach. The esophagus is continuous with the laryngopharynx. It passes through the posterior mediastinum in the thorax and enters the stomach through a hole in the thoracic diaphragm‚Äîthe esophageal hiatus, at the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra (T10). Its length averages 25 cm, varying with an individual's height. It is divided into cervical, thoracic and abdominal parts. The pharynx joins the esophagus at the esophageal inlet which is behind the cricoid cartilage. At rest the esophagus is closed at both ends, by the upper and lower esophageal sphincters. The opening of the upper sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex so that food is allowed through. The sphincter also serves to prevent back flow from the esophagus into the pharynx. The esophagus has a mucous membrane and the epithelium which has a protective function is continuously replaced due to the volume of food that passes inside the esophagus. During swallowing, food passes from the mouth through the pharynx into the esophagus. The epiglottis folds down to a more horizontal position to direct the food into the esophagus, and away from the trachea. Once in the esophagus, the bolus travels down to the stomach via rhythmic contraction and relaxation of muscles known as peristalsis. The lower esophageal sphincter is a muscular sphincter surrounding the lower part of the esophagus. The gastroesophageal junction between the esophagus and the stomach is controlled by the lower esophageal sphincter, which remains constricted at all times other than during swallowing and vomiting to prevent the contents of the stomach from entering the esophagus. As the esophagus does not have the same protection from acid as the stomach, any failure of this sphincter can lead to heartburn. =Diaphragm= The diaphragm is an important part of the body's digestive system. The muscular diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity where most of the digestive organs are located. The suspensory muscle attaches the ascending duodenum to the diaphragm. This muscle is thought to be of help in the digestive system in that its attachment offers a wider angle to the duodenojejunal flexure for the easier passage of digesting material. The diaphragm also attaches to, and anchors the liver at its bare area. The esophagus enters the abdomen through a hole in the diaphragm at the level of T10. =Stomach= Areas of the stomach The stomach is a major organ of the gastrointestinal tract and digestive system. It is a consistently J-shaped organ joined to the esophagus at its upper end and to the duodenum at its lower end. Gastric acid (informally gastric juice), produced in the stomach plays a vital role in the digestive process, and mainly contains hydrochloric acid and sodium chloride. A peptide hormone, gastrin, produced by G cells in the gastric glands, stimulates the production of gastric juice which activates the digestive enzymes. Pepsinogen is a precursor enzyme (zymogen) produced by the gastric chief cells, and gastric acid activates this to the enzyme pepsin which begins the digestion of proteins. As these two chemicals would damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by innumerable gastric glands in the stomach, to provide a slimy protective layer against the damaging effects of the chemicals on the inner layers of the stomach. At the same time that protein is being digested, mechanical churning occurs through the action of peristalsis, waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes. Gastric lipase secreted by the chief cells in the fundic glands in the gastric mucosa of the stomach, is an acidic lipase, in contrast with the alkaline pancreatic lipase. This breaks down fats to some degree though is not as efficient as the pancreatic lipase. The pylorus, the lowest section of the stomach which attaches to the duodenum via the pyloric canal, contains countless glands which secrete digestive enzymes including gastrin. After an hour or two, a thick semi-liquid called chyme is produced. When the pyloric sphincter, or valve opens, chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes further with digestive enzymes from the pancreas, and then passes through the small intestine, where digestion continues. When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood. 95% of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine. Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon of the large intestine, where the environment is slightly acidic. Some vitamins, such as biotin and vitamin K produced by bacteria in the gut flora of the colon are also absorbed. The parietal cells in the fundus of the stomach, produce a glycoprotein called intrinsic factor which is essential for the absorption of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin), is carried to, and through the stomach, bound to a glycoprotein secreted by the salivary glands - transcobalamin I also called haptocorrin, which protects the acid-sensitive vitamin from the acidic stomach contents. Once in the more neutral duodenum, pancreatic enzymes break down the protective glycoprotein. The freed vitamin B12 then binds to intrinsic factor which is then absorbed by the enterocytes in the ileum. The stomach is a distensible organ and can normally expand to hold about one litre of food. This expansion is enabled by a series of gastric folds in the inner walls of the stomach. The stomach of a newborn baby will only be able to expand to retain about 30 ml. =Spleen= The spleen is the largest lymphoid organ in the body but has other functions. It breaks down both red and white blood cells that are spent. This is why it is sometimes known as the 'graveyard of red blood cells'. A product of this digestion is the pigment bilirubin, which is sent to the liver and secreted in the bile. Another product is iron, which is used in the formation of new blood cells in the bone marrow. Medicine treats the spleen solely as belonging to the lymphatic system, though it is acknowledged that the full range of its important functions is not yet understood. =Liver= Liver and gall bladder The liver is the second largest organ (after the skin) and is an accessory digestive gland which plays a role in the body's metabolism. The liver has many functions some of which are important to digestion. The liver can detoxify various metabolites; synthesise proteins and produce biochemicals needed for digestion. It regulates the storage of glycogen which it can form from glucose (glycogenesis). The liver can also synthesise glucose from certain amino acids. Its digestive functions are largely involved with the breaking down of carbohydrates. It also maintains protein metabolism in its synthesis and degradation. In lipid metabolism it synthesises cholesterol. Fats are also produced in the process of lipogenesis. The liver synthesises the bulk of lipoproteins. The liver is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen and below the diaphragm to which it is attached at one part, the bare area of the liver. This is to the right of the stomach and it overlies the gall bladder. The liver synthesises bile acids and lecithin to promote the digestion of fat. Bile Bile produced by the liver is made up of water (97%), bile salts, mucus and pigments, 1% fats and inorganic salts. Bilirubin is its major pigment. Bile acts partly as a surfactant which lowers the surface tension between either two liquids or a solid and a liquid and helps to emulsify the fats in the chyme. Food fat is dispersed by the action of bile into smaller units called micelles. The breaking down into micelles creates a much larger surface area for the pancreatic enzyme, lipase to work on. Lipase digests the triglycerides which are broken down into two fatty acids and a monoglyceride. These are then absorbed by villi on the intestinal wall. If fats are not absorbed in this way in the small intestine problems can arise later in the large intestine which is not equipped to absorb fats. Bile also helps in the absorption of vitamin K from the diet. Bile is collected and delivered through the common hepatic duct. This duct joins with the cystic duct to connect in a common bile duct with the gallbladder. Bile is stored in the gallbladder for release when food is discharged into the duodenum and also after a few hours.Black's Medical Dictionary 39th Ed.1999 Gallbladder Gallbladder shown in green below the liver The gallbladder is a hollow part of the biliary tract that sits just beneath the liver, with the gallbladder body resting in a small depression.Drake, Richard L.; Vogl, Wayne; Tibbitts, Adam W.M. Mitchell; illustrations by Richard; Richardson, Paul (2005). Gray's anatomy for students. Philadelphia: Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone. p. 287. . It is a small organ where the bile produced by the liver is stored, before being released into the small intestine. Bile flows from the liver through the bile ducts and into the gall bladder for storage. The bile is released in response to cholecystokinin (CCK) a peptide hormone released from the duodenum. The production of CCK (by endocrine cells of the duodenum) is stimulated by the presence of fat in the duodenum. It is divided into three sections, a fundus, body and neck. The neck tapers and connects to the biliary tract via the cystic duct, which then joins the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. At this junction is a mucosal fold called Hartmann's pouch, where gallstones commonly get stuck. The muscular layer of the body is of smooth muscle tissue that helps the gallbladder contract, so that it can discharge its bile into the bile duct. The gallbladder needs to store bile in a natural, semi-liquid form at all times. Hydrogen ions secreted from the inner lining of the gallbladder keep the bile acidic enough to prevent hardening. To dilute the bile, water and electrolytes from the digestion system are added. Also, salts attach themselves to cholesterol molecules in the bile to keep them from crystallising. If there is too much cholesterol or bilirubin in the bile, or if the gallbladder doesn't empty properly the systems can fail. This is how gallstones form when a small piece of calcium gets coated with either cholesterol or bilirubin and the bile crystallises and forms a gallstone. The main purpose of the gallbladder is to store and release bile, or gall. Bile is released into the small intestine in order to help in the digestion of fats by breaking down larger molecules into smaller ones. After the fat is absorbed, the bile is also absorbed and transported back to the liver for reuse. =Pancreas= Pancreas, duodenum and bile duct Action of digestive hormones The pancreas is a major organ functioning as an accessory digestive gland in the digestive system. It is both an endocrine gland and an exocrine gland. The endocrine part secretes insulin when the blood sugar becomes high; insulin moves glucose from the blood into the muscles and other tissues for use as energy. The endocrine part releases glucagon when the blood sugar is low; glucagon allows stored sugar to be broken down into glucose by the liver in order to re-balance the sugar levels. The pancreas produces and releases important digestive enzymes in the pancreatic juice that it delivers to the duodenum. The pancreas lies below and at the back of the stomach. It connects to the duodenum via the pancreatic duct which it joins near to the bile duct's connection where both the bile and pancreatic juice can act on the chyme that is released from the stomach into the duodenum. Aqueous pancreatic secretions from pancreatic duct cells contain bicarbonate ions which are alkaline and help with the bile to neutralise the acidic chyme that is churned out by the stomach. The pancreas is also the main source of enzymes for the digestion of fats and proteins. Some of these are released in response to the production of CKK in the duodenum. (The enzymes that digest polysaccharides, by contrast, are primarily produced by the walls of the intestines.) The cells are filled with secretory granules containing the precursor digestive enzymes. The major proteases, the pancreatic enzymes which work on proteins, are trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. Elastase is also produced. Smaller amounts of lipase and amylase are secreted. The pancreas also secretes phospholipase A2, lysophospholipase, and cholesterol esterase. The precursor zymogens, are inactive variants of the enzymes; which avoids the onset of pancreatitis caused by autodegradation. Once released in the intestine, the enzyme enteropeptidase present in the intestinal mucosa activates trypsinogen by cleaving it to form trypsin; further cleavage results in chymotripsin. =Lower gastrointestinal tract= The lower gastrointestinal tract (GI), includes the small intestine and all of the large intestine. The intestine is also called the bowel or the gut. The lower GI starts at the pyloric sphincter of the stomach and finishes at the anus. The small intestine is subdivided into the duodenum, the jejunum and the ileum. The cecum marks the division between the small and large intestine. The large intestine includes the rectum and anal canal. Small intestine Duodenum Partially digested food starts to arrive in the small intestine as semi-liquid chyme, one hour after it is eaten. The stomach is half empty after an average of 1.2 hours. After four or five hours the stomach has emptied. In the small intestine, the pH becomes crucial; it needs to be finely balanced in order to activate digestive enzymes. The chyme is very acidic, with a low pH, having been released from the stomach and needs to be made much more alkaline. This is achieved in the duodenum by the addition of bile from the gall bladder combined with the bicarbonate secretions from the pancreatic duct and also from secretions of bicarbonate-rich mucus from duodenal glands known as Brunner's glands. The chyme arrives in the intestines having been released from the stomach through the opening of the pyloric sphincter. The resulting alkaline fluid mix neutralises the gastric acid which would damage the lining of the intestine. The mucus component lubricates the walls of the intestine. When the digested food particles are reduced enough in size and composition, they can be absorbed by the intestinal wall and carried to the bloodstream. The first receptacle for this chyme is the duodenal bulb. From here it passes into the first of the three sections of the small intestine, the duodenum. (The next section is the jejunum and the third is the ileum). The duodenum is the first and shortest section of the small intestine. It is a hollow, jointed C-shaped tube connecting the stomach to the jejunum. It starts at the duodenal bulb and ends at the suspensory muscle of duodenum. The attachment of the suspensory muscle to the diaphragm is thought to help the passage of food by making a wider angle at its attachment. Most food digestion takes place in the small intestine. Segmentation contractions act to mix and move the chyme more slowly in the small intestine allowing more time for absorption (and these continue in the large intestine). In the duodenum, pancreatic lipase is secreted together with a co-enzyme, colipase to further digest the fat content of the chyme. From this breakdown, smaller particles of emulsified fats called chylomicrons are produced. There are also digestive cells called enterocytes lining the intestines (the majority being in the small intestine). They are unusual cells in that they have villi on their surface which in turn have innumerable microvilli on their surface. All these villi make for a greater surface area, not only for the absorption of chyme but also for its further digestion by large numbers of digestive enzymes present on the microvilli. The chylomicrons are small enough to pass through the enterocyte villi and into their lymph capillaries called lacteals. A milky fluid called chyle, consisting mainly of the emulsified fats of the chylomicrons, results from the absorbed mix with the lymph in the lacteals. Chyle is then transported through the lymphatic system to the rest of the body. The suspensory muscle marks the end of the duodenum and the division between the upper gastrointestinal tract and the lower GI tract. The digestive tract continues as the jejunum which continues as the ileum. The jejunum, the midsection of the small intestine contains circular folds, flaps of doubled mucosal membrane which partially encircle and sometimes completely encircle the lumen of the intestine. These folds together with villi serve to increase the surface area of the jejunum enabling an increased absorption of digested sugars, amino acids and fatty acids into the bloodstream. The circular folds also slow the passage of food giving more time for nutrients to be absorbed. The last part of the small intestine is the ileum. This also contains villi and vitamin B12; bile acids and any residue nutrients are absorbed here. When the chyme is exhausted of its nutrients the remaining waste material changes into the semi-solids called feces, which pass to the large intestine, where bacteria in the gut flora further break down residual proteins and starches. Transit time through the small intestine is an average of 4 hours. Half of the food residues of a meal have emptied from the small intestine by an average of 5.4 hours after ingestion. Emptying of the small intestine is complete after an average of 8.6 hours. Cecum Cecum and beginning of ascending colon The cecum is a pouch marking the division between the small intestine and the large intestine. It lies below the ileocecal valve in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen. The cecum receives chyme from the last part of the small intestine, the ileum, and connects to the ascending colon of the large intestine. At this junction there is a sphincter or valve, the ileocecal valve which slows the passage of chyme from the ileum, allowing further digestion. It is also the site of the appendix attachment. Large intestine Lower GI tract - 3) Small intestine; 5) Cecum; 6) Large intestine In the large intestine, the passage of the digesting food in the colon is a lot slower, taking from 30 to 40 hours until it is removed by defecation. The colon mainly serves as a site for the fermentation of digestible matter by the gut flora. The time taken varies considerably between individuals. The remaining semi- solid waste is termed feces and is removed by the coordinated contractions of the intestinal walls, termed peristalsis, which propels the excreta forward to reach the rectum and exit via defecation from the anus. The wall has an outer layer of longitudinal muscles, the taeniae coli, and an inner layer of circular muscles. The circular muscle keeps the material moving forward and also prevents any back flow of waste. Also of help in the action of peristalsis is the basal electrical rhythm that determines the frequency of contractions. The taeniae coli can be seen and are responsible for the bulges (haustra) present in the colon. Most parts of the GI tract are covered with serous membranes and have a mesentery. Other more muscular parts are lined with adventitia. Blood supply Arteries and veins around the pancreas and spleen The digestive system is supplied by the celiac artery. The celiac artery is the first major branch from the abdominal aorta, and is the only major artery that nourishes the digestive organs. There are three main divisions ‚Äì the left gastric artery, the common hepatic artery and the splenic artery. The celiac artery supplies the liver, stomach, spleen and the upper 1/3 of the duodenum (to the sphincter of Oddi) and the pancreas with oxygenated blood. Most of the blood is returned to the liver via the portal venous system for further processing and detoxification before returning to the systemic circulation via the hepatic veins. The next branch from the abdominal aorta is the superior mesenteric artery, which supplies the regions of the digestive tract derived from the midgut, which includes the distal 2/3 of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, appendix, ascending colon, and the proximal 2/3 of the transverse colon. The final branch which is important for the digestive system is the inferior mesenteric artery, which supplies the regions of the digestive tract derived from the hindgut, which includes the distal 1/3 of the transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, and the anus above the pectinate line. Blood flow to the digestive tract reaches its maximum 20-40 minutes after a meal and lasts for 1.5-2 hours. Nerve supply Dietary life rules, Japan, Edo period. The enteric nervous system consists of some one hundred million neurons that are embedded in the peritoneum, the lining of the gastrointestinal tract extending from the esophagus to the anus. These neurons are collected into two plexuses - the myenteric (or Auerbach's) plexus that lies between the longitudinal and the smooth muscle layers, and the submucosal (or Meissner's) plexus that lies between the circular smooth muscle layer and the mucosa.Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, Vol. 194: Sensory Nerves, Brendan J. Canning, Domenico Spina. Springer. Page 341. Parasympathetic innervation to the ascending colon is supplied by the vagus nerve. Sympathetic innervation is supplied by the splanchnic nerves that join the celiac ganglia. Most of the digestive tract is innervated by the two large celiac ganglia, with the upper part of each ganglion joined by the greater splanchnic nerve and the lower parts joined by the lesser splanchnic nerve. It is from these ganglia that many of the gastric plexuses arise. Development Early in embryonic development, the embryo has three germ layers and abuts a yolk sac. During the second week of development, the embryo grows and begins to surround and envelop portions of this sac. The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract. Sections of this foregut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. During the fourth week of development, the stomach rotates. The stomach, originally lying in the midline of the embryo, rotates so that its body is on the left. This rotation also affects the part of the gastrointestinal tube immediately below the stomach, which will go on to become the duodenum. By the end of the fourth week, the developing duodenum begins to spout a small outpouching on its right side, the hepatic diverticulum, which will go on to become the biliary tree. Just below this is a second outpouching, known as the cystic diverticulum, that will eventually develop into the gallbladder. Clinical significance Each part of the digestive system is subject to a wide range of disorders many of which can be congenital. Mouth diseases can also be caused by pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi and as a side effect of some medications. Mouth diseases include tongue diseases and salivary gland diseases. A common gum disease in the mouth is gingivitis which is caused by bacteria in plaque. The most common viral infection of the mouth is gingivostomatitis caused by herpes simplex. A common fungal infection is candidiasis commonly known as thrush which affects the mucous membranes of the mouth. There are a number of esophageal diseases such as the development of Schatzki rings that can restrict the passageway, causing difficulties in swallowing. They can also completely block the esophagus. Stomach diseases are often chronic conditions and include gastroparesis, gastritis, and peptic ulcers. A number of problems including malnutrition and anemia can arise from malabsorption, the abnormal absorption of nutrients in the GI tract. Malabsorption can have many causes ranging from infection, to enzyme deficiencies such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It can also arise as a result of other gastrointestinal diseases such as coeliac disease. Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine. This can cause vitamin deficiencies due to the improper absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. The small intestine can also be obstructed by a volvulus, a loop of intestine that becomes twisted enclosing its attached mesentery. This can cause mesenteric ischemia if severe enough. A common disorder of the bowel is diverticulitis. Diverticula are small pouches that can form inside the bowel wall, which can become inflamed to give diverticulitis. This disease can have complications if an inflamed diverticulum bursts and infection sets in. Any infection can spread further to the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) and cause potentially fatal peritonitis. Crohn's disease is a common chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which can affect any part of the GI tract, but it mostly starts in the terminal ileum. Ulcerative colitis an ulcerative form of colitis, is the other major inflammatory bowel disease which is restricted to the colon and rectum. Both of these IBDs can give an increased risk of the development of colorectal cancer. Ulcerative coliltis is the most common of the IBDs Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common of the functional gastrointestinal disorders. These are idiopathic disorders that the Rome process has helped to define.Thompson WG, Longstreth GL, Drossman DA et al. (2000). Functional Bowel Disorders. In: Drossman DA, Corazziari E, Talley NJ et al. (eds.), Rome II: The Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders. Diagnosis, Pathophysiology and Treatment. A Multinational Consensus. Lawrence, KS: Allen Press. . Giardiasis is a disease of the small intestine caused by a protist parasite Giardia lamblia. This does not spread but remains confined to the lumen of the small intestine.Harrison's Internal Medicine, Harrison's Online Chapter 199 Protozoal intestinal infections and trochomoniasis It can often be asymptomatic, but as often can be indicated by a variety of symptoms. Giardiasis is the most common pathogenic parasitic infection in humans. There are diagnostic tools mostly involving the ingestion of barium sulphate to investigate disorders of the GI tract. These are known as upper gastrointestinal series that enable imaging of the pharynx, larynx, oesophagous, stomach and small intestine and lower gastrointestinal series for imaging of the colon. =In pregnancy= Gestation can predispose for certain digestive disorders.

The encounter was between an English armed merchant fleet of five ships of the Levant Company in convoy under Edward Wilkinson and a fleet of eleven Spanish and Maltese galleys under Don Pedro de Leyva. The English managed to repel all the attacks and returned home unmolested.Bicheno p. 223Braudel p. 1188 Although minor the battle had significant consequences in testing English firepower of which was to be used against the Spanish armada two years later when England was under threat of invasion.Pastor pg. 45Mattingly p. 98 Background The Company of Merchants of the Levant (or the Turkey Company) had been trading in the Mediterranean since 1580 after a successful petition to Queen Elizabeth I. They had established \\"factories\\" in Aleppo (its headquarters), as well as Constantinople, Alexandria, and Smyrna. After the Treaty of Nonsuch in 1585 and the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots in February 1587, Philip II of Spain decided that it was time to invade England and war was declared.Elton (1906), p81. As a result, the Levant company armed their ships as part of an investment by the English crown.Epstein p. 27 Philip II's maritime force lay within the Straits of Gibraltar where two squadrons of galleys were cruising under Giovanni Andrea Doria. Further in was the Sicilian squadron, composed of Spanish and Maltese galleys, under Captain-General Don Pedro de Leyva (who had replaced Don Alonso Martinez de Leyva the previous year). Both Doria and Leyva had orders to intercept any English merchant fleets which would have to sail through them.Fern√°ndez Duro, Ces√°reo: Armada espa√±ola desde la uni√≥n de los reinos de Castilla y de Arag√≥n. Vol. II. Instituto de Historia y Cultura Naval, p. 458. Five of the Levant company's ships left London in November 1585 - the 300 ton galleon Merchant Royal (being head of the fleet) under 'acting Admiral' Edward Wilkinson and the William and John were bound for Tripoli and the Toby for Constantinople. The Susan and the 300 ton armed merchant galleon Edward Bonaventure were bound for Venice. After completing their trading ventures, the ships met at Zante (Zakynthos) and after provisioning for the voyage home they set out together.Edward De Vere Newsletter - The Oxford Authorship Site - Voyages of Exploration (Article 2). Encounter On 13 July 1586, near the island of Pantelleria, between Tunis and Sicily, they soon sighted a number of ships that turned out to be galleys, eleven in all supported by two frigates. Wilkinson ordered the ships to venture close to the coast of the island so that they could not be surrounded and then ordered the ships ready for action. The sakarins, culverins, and demi culverins would show how well they fared since in ship-to-ship combat they had yet to be tested at sea in English service. A Spanish galley of the 16th century The Spanish admiral Don Pedro de Leyva closed in but did not attack instead sending a messenger aboard the Merchant Royal; they asked what they were doing and where they had come from. The English explained that trade had bought them to Turkey and were returning home to England. De Leyva then demanded to acknowledge their duty and obedience to the Spanish king but this was flatly refused by Wilkinson. After more demands were refused De Leyva then sent an ultimatum they would, 'either be sunk or be escorted into port' but he was rebuffed once more and the two fleets prepared for battle. =Battle= The admiral's galley fired the first shot which was responded by a culverin from the Merchant Royal and the action began. Each English ship matched itself with two Spanish galleys and fighting became bitter, the Spanish attempted to board which was the galleys principal military function. The English however kept up a steady rate of fire from their recently applied twenty pounder culverins (of which there were four in each ship) and twelve pounder demi-culverins (ten in each ship) as well as short-range perriers which had an effect in terms of accuracy and long-range damage infliction. English Galleon Edward Bonaventure The Spanish and Maltese galleys could not get in close enough range of the English ships to use their big fifty pounder guns, mounted in the waste line without being seriously damaged. One galley did get in close enough to bravely fire off two shots which caused the only English casualties; in the Susan before being forced off by her guns. William and John was very nearly a casualty after briefly touching the bottom in the shallows as they were hugging the shoreline but the wind was strong enough to carry it forward to safety. Soon de Leyva realized the attack was producing far more harm to his galleys and frigates and hardly any on the English. Even de Leyva's flag galley had sustained heavy damage and soon it warped from the fight, and after a few hours more fighting the rest of the Spanish ships had repeated the same feat. Most of them had sustained some form of damage and some were fighting to stay afloat, while the English edging away from the coast still in convoy formation, headed West. Aftermath The battle, which had lasted nearly five hours, had ended and the galleys withdrew immediately to the nearest port in Sicily for repairs. In order to get keep his flagship afloat, Leyva had to lash three of his seriously damaged galleys together, including his own in order to keep them from sinking. After fending off the Spanish attack, the English counted the costs but found very little, they had only two killed and fifteen wounded principally from the Susan and there was no serious damage to any of their ships. They put into Algiers for supplies, and then successfully ran the gauntlet of a second group of Spanish galleys which was waiting for them in the Gibraltar straits. No fight took place here as the English sailed through with the help of a heavy mist; as the galleys saw them they tried to catch up, but it was too late. The English returned home safely and news of the battle soon reached Cairo where the Company men were in conference on agreeing trade there, they received the news with alarm but were ecstatic with the results. Learning from the battle they agreed to use exactly the same military strategy for every Levant Company trading mission. The Levant company now knew what to do when entering hostile waters most notably in the Strait of Gibraltar. Here in 1590 an attempt was made by the Spanish on the same company ships but were repelled and again nearly a year later, that led to the same outcome. As a result of the battle the Royal Navy found heavy use of the Levant company ships. In terms of fighting it was a huge test for the future of the fighting ship of the line and the 'death knell' of the war galley.

How the interest rate channel works  While the central bank controls short term nominal interest rates with the federal funds rate, the overall economy is primarily affected by the long-term real interest rates charged by commercial banks to their customers. The interest rate channel focuses on how changes in the central bank‚Äôs policy rate affect various commercial interest rates including forex. The interest rate channel posits that an increase in the short-term nominal interest rate leads first to an increase in longer-term nominal interest rates. This is described by the expectation hypothesis of the term structure. In turn, this affects the real interest rate and the cost of capital, because prices are assumed to be sticky in the short-run. So an important aspect of this mechanism is the emphasis on the real, rather than the nominal, interest rate, which affects consumer and business decisions. Accordingly, a decline in the long-term real interest rate reduces both the cost of borrowing, and the money paid on interest-bearing deposits, therefore encouraging household spending on durable goods as well as investments by corporations. This rise in investments and durable good purchases boosts the level of aggregate demand and employment. This transmission mechanism is characterized by the following diagram of monetary expansion: M‚Üë ‚áí ir‚Üì ‚áí I‚Üë ‚áí Y‚Üë Where M‚Üë represents an expansionary monetary policy which leads to a decrease in the real interest rate (ir‚Üì), which in turn lowers the cost of capital. This causes a rise in investment spending and consumer durable expenditure I‚Üë, thereby leading to a rise in aggregate demand and an increase in output Y‚Üë.  Monetary policy implications  The interest rate channel plays a key role in the transmission of monetary impulses to the real economy. The central bank of a major country is, in principle, able to trigger expansionary and restrictive effects in the real economy, by varying the federal funds rate and hence the short-term nominal interest rate. However, it is difficult to explain how, with this channel, a central bank might target a relatively stable and low inflation rate of a longer time period. Although changes in the central bank‚Äôs policy interest rate can affect commercial interest rates quite quickly, there can be a significant lag before those changes influence spending and saving decisions, in turn having an impact on overall output.  Taylor rule  Taylor has a study on the interest rate channel, and he shows that there is strong empirical evidence for significant interest rate effects on consumer expenditure and investments, making the interest-rate monetary transmission mechanism strong. The Taylor Rule describes the central bank interest rate as a function of inflation, and a measure of economic activity. More precisely, the target federal funds rate equals the long term real interest rate, plus the current inflation rate, plus coefficients multiplied by the deviations between real and target inflation and the deviations between real and potential output. This rule can serve as a device for policy decisions when the goal of the central bank is to achieve price stability. For example, when the inflation rate exceeds its target, the rule recommends an increase in the interest rate.  Criticisms  Despite the Taylor rule, some researchers, Bernanke and Gertler for example, had difficulty in their empirical studies identifying significant effects of interest rate through the costs of capital. Another issue economists have is with the assumption that monetary policy has its strongest influence on short- term interest rates, such as the federal funds rate. Since this rate is an overnight rate, monetary policy has a relatively weaker impact on the real long-term rate and hence on the purchases of durable assets. Finally, this mechanism neglects the credit business of the banking system. This shortcoming provided the stimulus for other transmission mechanisms of monetary policy, especially the credit channel. This channel should not be seen as a separate, free-standing alternative to the interest rate mechanism, but rather as a set of factors that strengthen and transmit the interest rate effects.

The film had its world premiere on March 9, 2014, at South by Southwest and stars Nick Damici as a blind war veteran that becomes the victim of a werewolf attack. Synopsis Will moves his father, Ambrose McKinley, a fiercely independent, yet blind Vietnam War veteran and his seeing eye dog German Shepherd into a retirement community at the edge of a forest. Willful and adamant that he can live on his own, Ambrose and Will are clearly not on the best of terms. He meets three neighbor women, Gloria, Anna, and Victoria, who while at first admire Ambrose, are quickly put off by his attitude. He meets his neighbor Delores, who shares the duplex with him. That night, during a full moon, something breaks into Delores' kitchen and brutally slashes her to death. Ambrose hears the commotion and is also attacked by a massive werewolf. His dog comes to his defense as Ambrose struggles to find his gun. He deters the creature, but his dog is mortally wounded. The next day, the police find him cradling his dog, and despite the destruction and his claims of the attack, it is shrugged off as an animal attack. Suspecting a werewolf is responsible for the murders and mysterious disappearances of other park residents who wander into the woods, Ambrose mounts a defense. He buys an immaculate tombstone for his dog and begins to slowly dig a grave for him. Meeting with the local congregation, Ambrose, who could hear a rasping in the werewolf's breathing, monitors the people around him for similar issues. He encounters Gloria's husband, who is encased in an iron lung, but Gloria suspects Ambrose of trying to kill her husband when he accidentally disconnects the machine; she throws him out. His suspicions fall on the church's pastor, Father Roger Smith, who has developed a wheeze after years of chain smoking. He suggests Ambrose visit the church, prompting him to take a local shuttle from his house, where he meets another suspect, James Griffin, who is a friend of Smith's and has a similar wheeze from asthma. Uncomfortable with Ambrose's habits and lifestyle, the three women convince James to privately transport Ambrose. Ambrose goes to a gun shop and convinces the owner to create silver bullets. Ambrose learns that James had also previously purchased silver ammunition. The tombstone arrives, and Ambrose puts it in his back yard, still digging the grave. Complaints of this and the smell of his dog's decomposition gets Ambrose observed by the police, who become concerned for his well being. Despite this, Ambrose convinces them not to interfere. On the day of the next full moon, Ambrose finally finishes the grave and lays his dog to rest. Meanwhile, James meticulously begins to visit with the congregation, violently biting Gloria, Anne, Victoria, and Victoria's husband Bennet, cursing them to become werewolves. Ambrose visits Gloria, but finds her missing and her husband viciously decapitated; he runs home to arm himself. James confesses to Father Smith that he is a werewolf, but Smith does not believe him until he transforms. When he flees, the wolf viciously mauls him. Back at his home, Ambrose calls and leaves his son a voicemail, revealing that he had lost his deceased wife's ring, and he had not sold it, as Will suspected. He apologizes and says his goodbyes, as he believes he will not survive the night. Using his keen hearing, Ambrose dispatches the werewolves descending on his property with his weapons and a series of booby traps. He kills the four new werewolves but is bitten by James. In the struggle, they battle into Ambrose's back yard, where Ambrose finally kills James and calmly sits down on his porch. Will, having heard his father's final words, rushes to his house. He sees the bodies of werewolves, half-turned back into their human forms, before discovering Ambrose dead, having purposefully overdosed on his medication before the battle had even begun to ensure that he will not live as a werewolf. Later, Will and his wife stand at his father's military funeral at dusk, where Will accepts the tri-folded flag and gives it to his wife. He then takes out his father's rifle, takes aim at the rising moon, and fires.

Nick Damici was confirmed to be leading the film in February 2013, and filming began in Hudson Valley, New York in June of the same year. Damici had some difficulty portraying a blind man, as he stated that you \\"can't just blindfold yourself to learn because it doesn‚Äôt work that way. Even when you‚Äôre blindfolded you‚Äôre seeing more than a blind person sees. I just had to do it looking peripherally and trusting Adrian that it came off okay.\\" The film's biggest challenge came from the werewolf transformation scene, as Bogliano noted that \\"[not even] the producers knew if it was going to work until we finally finished.\\" Fessenden, who produced and had a cameo, brought on special effects artist Robert Kurtzman. Fessenden said Kurtzman agreed to do the film because he has a soft spot for werewolves. Reception The film received mixed reviews. Shock Till You Drop gave Late Phases a lukewarm review, commenting that while it was \\"occasionally thrilling\\" it was \\"obviously going for the Bubba Ho-Tep vibe\\" but didn't have the \\"ominpresent quirkiness and energy Bubba Ho-Tep carried.\\" Twitch Film panned the film overall, as they felt that it was \\"a concept that looks like it absolutely should have worked on paper, but ends up becoming a cautionary tale about what happens when you put too much stock in your wolf rather than your sheep.\\" Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting gave the film five skulls out of five, stating that the film is \\"a tale of hardcore werewolf violence, a tangible father/son relationship, redemption, and a whole lotta heart. It‚Äôs funny, brash, and exciting, but knows when to pull back and let the emotion sink in. Simply put, it‚Äôs a masterpiece of the werewolf genre because of what it accomplishes on top of the scares, which is deliver a truly emotional, heartfelt story of a father and son.\\" Release The film was selected to screen in April 2014 at the Stanley Film Festival. The home release was March 10, 2015, on video on demand, digital download and on Blu- ray and DVD by Dark Sky Films. The film is currently available to be streamed on Netflix as of January 2018.

Berndt Rieger: Der Fahrdienstleiter des Todes. Franz Novak, der transportexperte Eichmanns. Eine Biographie, Norderstedt 2001, S.127f) was an Austrian SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer. Novak was Adolf Eichmann's railroad and transportation timetable expert; he coordinated the railroad deportation of European Jews to concentration and extermination camps. Biography Franz Novak left school in 1928 and began an apprenticeship in printing in Wolfsberg. He printed the Unterk√§rntner Nachrichten, an anti-semitic local newspaper, close to the Greater German People's Party. In October 1929, he became a member of the Hitler Youth. In April 1933, he joined the SA, a month after joining the Nazi Party. After the party was banned in Austria in July 1933, he joined illegally and became chief of the Wolfsberg section of the NSBO and SA leader. He participated in the coup against Engelbert Dollfuss in July 1934. After its failure, he fled to Yugoslavia and then went to Germany and joined the Austrian Legion. After the Anschluss in 1938, he moved to Vienna and became the deputy of Adolf Eichmann in the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna, although he received his orders directly from Rolf G√ºnther. Novak also became a member of the SS; on 1 December 1938 he was promoted to SS-Untersturmf√ºhrer. =World War II= In July 1939, he participated in the opening of the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Prague, where his immediate superior was SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Hans G√ºnther. At the beginning of 1940, Eichmann brought Novak with him to the RSHA in Berlin and put him in his new office, the Eichmannreferat, on \\"Jewish matters and evacuations\\". His immediate superior was once again Rolf G√ºnther. Novak handled the technical problems of organizing deportation trains \\"resettling\\" Poles and Jews from the incorporated territories to the General Government in 1940-41; he requisitioned railcars from Deutsche Reichsbahn for deportation and coordinated with it the hours of passages of these trains in coordination with the SS, police and concentration camp officials. Novak worked closely with the SiPo (Security Police); it was his job to inform each regional and district office of the SiPo of the date and quota (usually 1,000 people) of the train that the SiPo was to fill with Jewish deportees.Christopher Browning. The Origins of the Final Solution : The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 - March 1942 (With contributions by J√ºrgen Matth√§us), Lincoln : University of Nebraska Press, 2004. pp. 381-383 Novak also worked closely with other leaders of the \\"Jewish question\\" in other countries, such as Theodor Dannecker, Alois Brunner and Dieter Wisliceny. He was then part of the Eichmann-Kommando in Budapest which, from 15 March to 9 July 1944, led 476,000 Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz. Novak deported 6,000 to 12,000 people every day. Most of the deportees were killed immediately after their arrival at Auschwitz. By the end of the war, Novak had organized at least 260 trains from Germany, Austria and the Protectorate, at least 147 from Hungary, 87 from the Netherlands, 76 from France, 63 from Slovakia, 27 from Belgium, 23 from Greece, 11 from Italy, 7 from Bulgaria and 6 from Croatia ‚Äî more than 707 from western and southern Europe. =Post- war= In 1945, Franz Novak disappeared under a false name. After the War Crimes Act and Verbotsgesetz 1947 (Prohibition Act 1947) had been repealed in 1957, Novak resumed his real name. In the course of investigations of the Adolf Eichmann case, the prosecutor of Frankfurt issued arrest warrants in 1961 against Eichmann's former employees, including Novak. Novak was arrested on 20 January 1961 in Vienna at his place of work, managing a print shop. During interrogation, he denied responsibility for the deportation of Jews. He said at his trial in 1964: \\"For me, Auschwitz was just a train station.\\" Ella Lingens-Reiner, Hermann Langbein and Franz Danimann testified against him. On 17 December 1964, the jury did not convict for aiding and abetting murder, but sentenced him to eight years in prison only because of Article 87 of the Austrian penal code known as the \\"Railroad Acts\\", committing the criminal offense of intentionally compromising the integrity of the passengers during transport by not providing adequate water, food and toilet facilities. The conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court of Austria due to a technicality, and a retrial was ordered. On 6 September 1966, at his second trial, the jury ruled that Novak acted under superior orders, and he was acquitted. The Supreme Court again overturned this ruling and ordered a third trial. Novak was found guilty on 18 December 1969 and sentenced him to nine years of imprisonment, but the verdict was appealed, during which time Novak was allowed to live freely. On 13 April 1972, the Supreme Court sentenced him to seven years in prison under Article 87. However, Novak, who had been dismissed in 1966 after five years in custody, was told that the remainder of his sentence no longer had to be completed. He was granted a pardon by Austrian President Rudolf Kirchschl√§ger. Simon Wiesenthal later calculated that Novak spent three minutes and twenty seconds in custody for each victim whom he sent to his or her death at Auschwitz.

All four of the victims were either partially or completely skeletonized; they were believed to have died between 1977 and 1981. In 2017, investigators announced that Terrence \\"Terry\\" Peder Rasmussen, who used multiple aliases including Robert \\"Bob\\" Evans, was the most likely suspect. His identity was confirmed via DNA from a son from his first marriage. He was also confirmed, via DNA, to be the father of the 2-to-4-year-old girl who was one of the Bear Brook victims. He is believed to be responsible for several other murders, including that of Denise Beaudin, his known girlfriend, who disappeared in 1981. Under a different alias, Curtis Kimball, he was convicted and sentenced for the murder in 2002 of his then-wife. He died in prison in 2010.https://abcnews.go.com/US/jane-doe-child-case-uncovered-serial-killer- identified/story?id=69648434 In 2019, the three biologically related females were identified as mother, Marlyse Elizabeth Honeychurch, and her two daughters (of different biological fathers) Marie Elizabeth Vaughn, and Sarah Lynn McWaters, last seen in November 1978. The middle child, identified as Rasmussen's daughter, currently remains unidentified. Based on the date they disappeared, available documents and Rasmussen's activities, the victims most likely died between 1978 and 1981. Discovery On November 10, 1985, a hunter found a metal 55-gallon drum near the site of a burned-down store at Bear Brook State Park in Allenstown, New Hampshire. Inside were the bodies of an adult female and young girl, wrapped in plastic (possibly a garbage bag). Autopsies determined both had died of blunt trauma. The two were buried in an Allenstown cemetery with a tombstone that read: \\"Here lies the mortal remains known only to God of a woman aged 23-33 and a girl child aged 8-10. Their slain bodies were found on November 10th, 1985, in Bear Brook State Park. May their souls find peace in God‚Äôs loving care.\\" On May 9, 2000, the remains of two young girls were found near the first discovery site. These bodies were also in a metal 55-gallon drum. The cause of death for these children was also blunt force trauma. Examination Reconstructions of the victims by Carl Koppelman. The child pictured at the far right is currently unidentified. The adult, later identified as Honeychurch, was determined to be Caucasian with possible Native American ancestry. Her age at the time of death was estimated to be 23 to 33. She had curly or wavy brown hair and was between and in height. Her teeth showed significant dental work, including multiple fillings and three extractions. The three girls were thought to also have some Native American heritage; they had light or European-American complexions. The girl found with the adult female, later identified as Vaughn, was between 5 and 11 years old. She had symptoms of pneumonia, a crooked front tooth and a diastema (space between her top teeth), two earrings in each ear, and was between and tall. Her hair was wavy and light brown; she had no dental fillings. The middle child, currently unidentified, also had a gap between her front teeth and died at an age between 2 and 4. She had brown hair and was about tall. She had an overbite, which was probably noticeable. She also may have suffered from anemia. DNA proved this child was fathered by Terry Peder Rasmussen. In February 2020, it was announced that DNA analysis suggested the child was primarily Caucasian, with slight Asian, African, and Native American heritage. The organization later released an updated version of the child's facial reconstruction. The youngest girl, later identified as McWaters, was estimated to be 1 to 3 years old, had long blond or light brown hair, was between and tall, and also had a gap between her front teeth. Investigation In the early days of the investigation, authorities publicized the case in the United States and some parts of Canada. At least ten possible identities were ruled out. Despite hundreds of leads, the bodies were not identified. In June 2013, new versions of the victims' facial reconstructions were created by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. These versions incorporated their dental information, showing how their teeth could have affected the appearance of their faces. The reconstructions were created in black and white, as their skin tones and eye colors could not be determined. In November 2015, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children released a third set of reconstructions of the four victims at a news conference at the New Hampshire State Attorney General's office. =DNA and isotopic evidence= In 2014, police announced that DNA profiling had revealed through MtDNA that the woman, and oldest and youngest girls were maternally related. This means that the woman could have been the girls' mother, aunt, or older sister. In 2015, the woman was identified as the mother of the two girls. Other forensic information showed that the woman and children lived together in the Northeastern United States between two weeks and three months before their deaths. Investigators have concluded the woman and two of the children lived in the area where their bodies were found. Advanced forensic testing showed the 2-to-4-year-old girl (since identified as Rasmussen's daughter) probably spent most of her childhood in either the upper Northeast or upper Midwest, perhaps Wisconsin. In 2019, however, it is stated that the nonrelated child most likely originated from Arizona, Texas, California or Oregon, although additional locations cannot be excluded. =Later developments= Terry Peder Rasmussen pictured in 2002 after his arrest for the murder of Eunsoon Jun In January 2017, it was announced that Denise Beaudin, who had been missing since 1981, was connected to the murders. Beaudin disappeared from Manchester, New Hampshire, along with her young daughter and then-boyfriend Robert \\"Bob\\" Evans. She was not reported missing until 2016, when her daughter resurfaced alive and well in California after there was more publicity about the murders and Beaudin's disappearance. The daughter is keeping her name private. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children subsequently announced that an unidentified man, known by the alias \\"Robert Evans,\\" was found through DNA to be the father of the middle child (who was not related to the three other victims). He had abandoned another young girl \\"Lisa\\" at a camp ground, and she was found to not be his daughter. Her DNA confirmed that one of the Bear Brook girls was also Evans/Rasmussen's daughter. Authorities believed that Evans was the killer of the four Bear Brook victims, but did not elaborate. Authorities said in 2008 that the Bear Brook woman was not Beaudin. They also said that \\"Robert Evans\\" was a pseudonym and that the man's legal identity was unknown. In 2015 they said that the adult woman at Bear Brook had been identified as the mother of two of the girls. Evans died in prison in December 2010. He had been convicted and sentenced as Evans for the 2002 murder and dismemberment of his wife at the time, Eunsoon Jun, a chemist in California. In June 2017, police released a video of a police interview of Evans in hopes of finding his true identity. Two months later, Robert Evans was confirmed as Terrence \\"Terry\\" Peder Rasmussen, through Y-DNA testing from a DNA sample contributed by one of his sons from what is believed to be his first marriage. Born in 1943, Rasmussen was a native of Denver, Colorado. He married in 1969, had four children, and lived in Phoenix, Arizona, and Redwood City, California. His wife left him between 1973 and 1974 and his family last saw him around Christmas 1974. One of his sons from this marriage provided the DNA sample that confirmed Rasmussen as Evans in June 2017. The senior Rasmussen, known as the Chameleon killer, is believed to have used \\"at least five different aliases in a decades-long run of crimes across the country, including at least five homicides, and likely more.\\" =Identifications= On June 6, 2019, New Hampshire investigators held a press conference regarding the case and revealed the identities of three of the victims. Marlyse Elizabeth Honeychurch (b. 1954) was the mother of Marie Elizabeth Vaughn (b. 1971) and Sarah Lynn McWaters (b. 1977), all of whom went missing from La Puente, California, around Thanksgiving 1978, while she was dating Rasmussen. Honeychurch had an argument with her mother and left the residence, never contacting her relatives again. Honeychurch may have adopted the alias name \\"Elizabeth Evans\\" to use in legal documents during May 1980. It is believed that all four victims were murdered before 1981, as Rasmussen was known to have left New Hampshire after this time. Sarah's younger half brother, who had never met her, created a post in 1999 on the Ancestry.com website in efforts to locate her. She was born in Hawaiian Gardens, California, when her father was in the Marines. Similar posts also aided in the identifications of the victims. Marlyse had previously married Marie's father in June 1971 and divorced by 1974. She married Sarah's father in September 1974, and the two were separated by the time she was known to be dating Rasmussen. The children both went through periods where they were in the custody of their fathers, but Marlyse would later regain guardianship. By October 1978, Sarah's father was seeing another woman and Sarah was presumably in the care of her mother. Honeychurch and Vaughn's funeral was held in November 2019 in Allenstown, during which they were given a new headstone bearing their names. In attendance were members of Honeychurch's family and Rasmussen's daughter from his first marriage. Sarah was laid to rest in Connecticut, closer to her father's family. The fourth victim's identity is not yet known, but investigators stated that through advanced DNA testing they could confirm the child was Rasmussen's. They have so far been unable to identify who the mother of the child is and whether or not she may still be alive. In February 2020, a new rendering of the fourth victim was released by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children and New Hampshire State Police.

Early life  Giannis Alafouzos was born in 1957 and is the son of businessman, shipowner and newspaper publisher Aristeidis Alafouzos. He graduated from the University of Oxford with a degree in Economics and History. During his student years, he was an athlete, in particular the 100m sprint. He is a sailor with significant international distinctions. He is married and has three children.  Shipping  In the early 1980s, after completing his postgraduate studies, Giannis Alafouzos followed in the steps of his father's career in shipping and worked towards the expansion of his family's shipping company, Glafki (Hellas) Maritime Company. He served as managing director of Kyklades Maritime Corporation, a company operating a modern tanker fleet, and also founded the shipping company Ermis Maritime Corporation. Today he continues his successful career in maritime business. Presently, Kyklades Maritime Corporation is expanding its fleet with two newbuildings currently under construction in Japan.  Media  Giannis Alafouzos is the president and managing director of SKAI media group. In 1989, he bought the radio news station SKAI 100.3 and then founded the TV station of the same name. Today, the media group includes the TV station SKAI, 3 radio stations, SKAI 100.3, Melodia 99.2 and SPORT FM 94.6 and various new portals such as skaikairos.gr and sport-fm.gr. He is also the publisher of the daily morning newspaper, Kathimerini.  Philanthropy  Giannis Alafouzos supports many environmental programs and philanthropic activities, organizing and promoting these through the SKAI media outlets and his non-profit organization Oloi Mazi Boroume (English translation: Together We Can). Under his management, Skai Group and Skai Perivallon (English translation: Skai Environment) have organized many actions to clean territories in Greece and recycling. SKAI, along with Kathimerini and WWF Hellas established the \\"Parnitha Observatory\\", an action to inform people about the restoration of the burned areas. Since the beginning of 2010, Oloi Mazi Boroume has acted as an ongoing social campaign focused on raising public awareness and organizing events to support several causes and groups (organizing concerts to raise funds for the poor, collecting clothes, food and medicine, setting up soup kitchens around Greece and other similar activities). Oloi Mazi Boroume, as in almost all of his nationwide philanthropic operations, works in close collaboration with the Greek Orthodox Church, aiming to help victims of the Greek financial crisis. Giannis Alafouzos is among the business leaders who signed the initiative of the Prince of Wales known as Bali Communiqu√© calling for a comprehensive legally binding United Nations framework to tackle climate change.  Panathinaikos F.C.  In May 2012, Giannis Alafouzos, together with players and fans of the football team Panathinaikos F.C., founded the association Panathinaikos Alliance 2012 which took a majority stake in the football club. In September 2012 he was elected president of Panathinaikos F.C. by the members of the Alliance in order to advance the reorganization and consolidation of the association. In 2017, he retired as the chairman of Panathinaikos F.C., but remained a member of the board of directors. During his chairmanship, Panathinaikos won the Greek Cup and he was honored by the president of the veteran soccer players, Vasilis Konstantinou, for his contribution to Panathinaikos. Controversy and conflicts On 10 August 2016, the Greek Prosecutor for Financial Crimes, Panagiotis Athanasiou, ordered the freezing of Alafouzos' property and bank accounts, after an investigation by the Greek Center for the Audit of High-Income Taxpayers (KEFOMEP) concluded that certain amounts were not reflected in his tax returns.http://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/601898/desmeuthike-i- periousia-tou-gianni-alafouzou-apo-to-kefomep/ Eventually, Alafouzos proceeded to pay the amount due, certified by KEFOMEP, and his property was released. Alafouzos stated that he welcomed the audit and that he would assist in the process with any available information. In 2016, SKAI TV journalist Kyriakos Thomaidis and Giannis Alafouzos, being the managing director of SKAI, were sued for violating the Privacy Act regarding the 2015 Greek football scandal but were cleared of all charges. Giannis Alafouzos has come up against much opposition in his efforts to reveal corruption in Greek football.

The company started in Los Angeles in 2009, and has since expanded throughout Southern California, Phoenix, San Antonio and Austin. Overview The Grilled Cheese Truck The Grilled Cheese Truck started as a joint venture between Dave Danhi (a Los Angeles-based chef) and Michele Grant (chef and entrepreneur). Danhi devised the idea when he competed in the 7th Annual Grilled Cheese Invitational, a grilled cheese competition that takes place every Spring in Los Angeles, California. As he left the competition and saw the food trucks lined up outside, as well as the interest in grilled cheese from the competition, he got the idea to open the \\"grilled cheese food truck\\". After several discussions with Grant, they decided to open up a gourmet grilled cheese truck together in Los Angeles. Referencing both of their culinary backgrounds, the tag line for the truck is: ‚ÄúChef driven Grilled Cheese, ‚Äòcause that‚Äôs how we roll...‚Äù The Grilled Cheese Truck has been awarded accolades including \\"10 Best Grilled Cheese Trucks\\" and one of the \\"Top 10 Sandwiches in LA\\". Grant, Danhi and the truck have had television appearances on The Price is Right, Unwrapped, House of Food, Be Our Guest, The Rachael Ray Show, The Joan and Melissa Show, and The Cooking Channel. Danhi's grilled cheese recipes have appeared in talk shows, magazines, blogs and cookbooks. History and business activity 2009 - 2012: In 2009, The Grilled Cheese Truck was launched in Los Angeles by hollywood chef and entrepreneur Michele Grant and celebrity chef Dave Danhi. The company got its start with only one truck, but from the very beginning was a huge hit in the burgeoning Los Angeles Gourmet Food Truck scene. Within six months Grant and Danhi had added a second truck and were expanding not just their physical reach within the greater Los Angeles area, but their social media reach as well. By the third anniversary of the truck‚Äôs opening, it had well upwards of 170,000 followers via Twitter and Facebook spanning the entire globe. The Grilled Cheese Truck had become a go to destination for tourists visiting Los Angeles, with several couples ‚Äúmeeting their match‚Äù while waiting in line to buy food from the truck. During this time, according to Mr. Danhi who co-owned the business, the trucks generated gross revenues of $12,000 to $15,000 per week ($624,000 to $780,000 on an annualized basis) and net cash flow of $112,000 to $156,000 on an annualized basis. At the time of the completion of sale of The Grilled Cheese Truck to TRIG Acquisition at the end of October 2012, the company was on target to earn 1.4 million dollars in revenue by the end of the year. 2012 - 2016: On October 18, 2012, TRIG Acquisition 1, Inc., a Delaware Form 10 company, acquired The Grilled Cheese Truck brand. The company subsequently changed its name to The Grilled Cheese Truck, followed by another name change to American Patriot Brands (APB). In 2012, when Grant left the company, the company merged with TRIG Acquisition 1, Inc., forming Grilled Cheese Truck, Inc. This merger helped to expand the company to other markets and they have plans to become the first publicly traded food truck. The company also enlisted General Wesley Clark (USA, Ret.) to help bring The Grilled Cheese Truck national. His primary focus is to help promote, identify, train, support and help franchise return service veterans with their own Grilled Cheese Trucks. APB never completed its franchise filings with the Federal Trade Commission or the State of California. At its peak, APB operated 10 trucks, eight of which were company-owned and two of which were licensed. APB did not disclose any per truck financial information in its SEC filings. During the period that the eight company-owned trucks operated, the company generated $3,650,021 in revenue and a net loss of $7,712,208, as disclosed in its last 10-K filing for the period ending December 31, 2014. APB is not current in its SEC filings as of January 18, 2017. 2016‚ÄìJuly 2020: Big Cheese, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on September 16, 2016. On October 4, 2016, it acquired the Grilled Cheese Truck brand with the attendant trademarks pursuant to an Intellectual Property Rights Purchase agreement with Dave Danhi, founder. Danhi had reacquired the rights on September 23, 2016 from APB, which had originally acquired the rights from Danhi. APB had re- positioned itself in the cannabis business, which created the opportunity for Danhi to reacquire the brand. July 2020: On July 14, 2020 over social media, Danhi announced via social media that The Grilled Cheese Truck was to permanently close by the end of the month.  Crowdfunding Endeavors  Big Cheese Inc., owner of The Grilled Cheese Truck brand, filed a Form-C on January 18, 2017 to raise capital through JOBS Act securities regulations on Microventures. The Grilled Cheese Truck successfully closed the first ever Reg CF equity crowdfunding campaign by a food truck on Microventures with 332 investors investing $199,186 on April 1, 2017.

It typically took place during the first weekend of March, and attracted Welsh ex-pats and Welsh descendants from all over the United States. Activities included Welsh and other Celtic music, genealogy, food and drink, Welsh language classes, cultural exhibits, Welsh authors, crafts, and children's activities. The festival was founded by Lorin Morgan-Richards, produced by the Welsh League of Southern California, and was one of the largest Welsh festivals in America. Past headling acts included Siobhan Owen, Meinir Gwilym, and Poxy Boggards.http://www.walesworldwide.org/2015/02/st-davids-day-festival-returns- to-hollywood/ History The West Coast Eisteddfod, the first Welsh festival in Los Angeles since 1925, took place September 23‚Äì25, 2011, attracting over 2,000 attendees. The event was coordinated by A Raven Above Press and the Meriweather Lewis Memorial Eisteddfod Foundation. In December 2012, the Los Angeles Welsh Presbyterian Church, a major cultural landmark that served the Welsh community for over 100 years, closed its doors. With the success of the festival and untimely closure of the church, Lorin Morgan-Richards of A Raven Above Press began re-building the festival to ensure the Welsh community had a cultural presence. In 2013, coinciding with the Los Angeles St. David‚Äôs Day Festival, Richard Burton received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The induction, supported by a Western Mail campaign, included appearances by Michael Sheen, Ioan Gruffudd, and Richard Burton‚Äôs family. The 2013 event featuring Siobhan Owen was captured on film in Do Ye the Little Things in Life: St. David's Day Festival-National Day of Wales 2013.http://fr.fulltv.tv/do-ye-the-little-things-in-life-st-david-s-day- festival-national-day-of-wales-2013-2013.html Following the 2014 event, Lorin Morgan-Richards called on active members of the community to form the Welsh League of Southern California to build on what had been achieved. While Richards stepped aside, Peter Anthony Freeman was elected President and spoke of the importance of the event: ‚ÄúThe celebration of Saint David‚Äôs is more than commemorating the life of an ancient monk. This is a celebration and a reminder of where we come from. One of the greatest features of America is that it does not ask us to abandon our culture, rather we are asked to contribute our culture, so that the whole may become greater than the sum of the parts.‚Äùhttp://www.british-weekly.com/?p=16709 On October 10, 2015, the WLSC with involvement by Marco Marenghi held several meetups including their second Gymanfa Ganu at the Los Angeles Welsh Presbyterian Church featuring soprano Cherie Hill and poet Hilary Wyn Williams (mother of Thomas Dekker). The St. David's Day Festival meanwhile was held at the Mayflower Club in North Hollywood for both 2015 and 2016.http://www.meetup.com/LA_Brits_Meetup/events/229156726/ In the fall of 2016, it was announced an informal breakup of the league as Peter Anthony Freeman resigned from his position to retire in Wales.

In 2005, tapes related to interrogations carried out at a black interrogation center in Thailand were destroyed by the CIA. Mr. Jose Rodriguez, former CIA clandestine branch chief, who ordered the destruction of the tapes, has said through his attorney that he based his decision on legal advice from CIA lawyers Steven Hermes and Robert Eatinger. The information received from Hermes and Eatinger did not explicitly endorse the tape destruction, but claimed there was \\"no legal impediment\\" to disposing of them.  2014 CIA-SSCI dispute  On 11 March 2014, Senator Feinstein gave a speech on the floor of the Senate, addressing Eatinger by title, not by name. In the speech Feinstein said that the CIA had launched two investigations of SSCI staff involved in analysis of the Panetta review, while SSCI staff were producing a document addressing CIA torture activities in which Eatinger himself was involved. Feinstein said the two investigations, launched at the behest of Eatinger, amounted to an attempt at \\"intimidation\\". Feinstein stated that, ::There is no legitimate reason to allege to the Justice Department that Senate staff may have committed a crime. I view the acting general counsel's referral as a potential effort to intimidate this staff‚Äîand I am not taking it lightly. ::I should note that for most, if not all, of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, the now acting general counsel was a lawyer in the CIA's Counterterrorism Center‚Äîthe unit within which the CIA managed and carried out this program. ::From mid-2004 until the official termination of the detention and interrogation program in January 2009, he was the unit's chief lawyer.

Barjatya under the banner of Rajshri Productions. It features Rajeev Khandelwal in the title role of Samrat. The film was initially scheduled for release on 1 May 2014 release but was released ahead of schedule on 25 April 2014. Plot Dimpy Singh (Madalsa Sharma), approaches Samrat Tilakdhari (Rajeev Khandelwal), a private investigator, with a strange case. Their garden was ruined for unknown, but apparently natural reasons; leading horticulturists have examined the fading plants but they have not been able to identify the probable reason. Further, her father's favorite horse died prematurely; once again the cause is unknown. Furthermore, the health of Dimpy's father Mahendra Pratap Singh (Girish Karnad), otherwise a strong and balanced man, has deteriorated. These possibly related problems prompt Samrat's curiosity. Samrat along with his assistant friend, Chakradhar Pandey (Gopal Datt), visits the huge estate of Mahendra Pratap Singh. As he starts investigating, he discovers many mysterious facts. The story progresses when a murder takes place in the house, which leads to a series of events, complicating things for Samrat. Every character around seems to be hiding something. Then Anuj is found killed. Dimpy is stuck in a brakeless car when Samrat saves her life. Doubt hovers around Mrs. Dave as Samrat learns she is a college friend of Mahendra Pratap. But she is innocent as she played pranks on Mahendra just as a sweet revenge for his college days. She reveals a college secret to Samrat: She had broken her legs due to a small prank played by Mahendra in their college days. And she proves her innocence. Samrat then focuses on other characters. Sanjay is the killer. He is son of Mahendra Pratap's first wife and wanted to revenge his father as he holds his father responsible for his mother's death.

Strangely, when the director of the film narrated Rajeev Khandelwal the script, he did not narrate the entire script, but did it only till the climax scene. The director Kaushik Ghatak told Rajeev that he would tell him the climax only if he came on board. Once Rajeev agreed to do the film, Kaushik kept his promise of narrating the climax to him, but, to his surprise, Rajeev did not want to hear it and requested him not to. Telling us his reasons for doing that, Rajeev said, \\"The script had been so gripping that I decided to play Samrat in my head, trying to actually solve the case while shooting the film.\\".  Reception  Official theatrical trailer was released on 18 March 2014 at a suburban multiplex in Mumbai. The trailer received mixed reviews. One review said: Rajeev Khandelwal the main protagonist for Samrat & Co. very happily copies Benedict Cumberbatch, the British actor portraying the character of Sherlock Holmes in the hit series by the same name. Rajeev is desperately trying to be cool and stylish, something that does not come naturally to him and does not look good on him.http://businessofcinema.com/trailers- video-2/trailer-review-samrat-co-hollywood- rip/137431http://www.india.com/showbiz/rajeev-khandelwals-samrat-co-looks-rip- off-of-sherlock-25326/ Another review said: \\"The industry and fans by large, have found the trailer gripping and true to its claims of the film being ‚Äòdilchasp‚Äô and intriguing.

First staged by the Canadian Opera Company, the opera premiered October 13, 2018 at the Four Seasons Centre in Toronto, directed by Peter Hinton. Background and development Marble bust of Hadrian at the Palazzo dei Conservatori Hadrian is Wainwright's second opera, following Prima Donna, which premiered at the Manchester International Festival in 2009. Wainwright was inspired by Marguerite Yourcenar's Memoirs of Hadrian (1951) and began composing Hadrian before Prima Donna. However, lacking the confidence to \\"navigate all the emotional possibilities\\" that Hadrian would require, he concentrated his efforts on Prima Donna as his first opera production. On March 21, 2018, Cincinnati Opera and CCM Opera's joint Opera Fusion: New Works program presented excerpts from Hadrian and answered questions about the upcoming production. A dress rehearsal was performed on October 11, 2018. Description The opera in four acts focuses on Hadrian's relationship with Antinous, who has drowned. According to Wainwright and MacIvor, \\"You've got everything. A big chorus, lots of characters, the Nile... a love story... a political story... all the elements of traditional grand opera.\\" MacIvor has also said of the opera: \\"The mystery of why Hadrian's remarkable love for Antinous ‚Äì underlined by his bottomless grief ‚Äì has not been celebrated widely as a model of eros points to a fear of same-sex love that has changed little from his age to ours.

In 1991, motivated by Rivest's DESX construction, Even and Mansour proposed a much simpler scheme (the \\"two-key Even‚ÄìMansour scheme\\"), which they suggested was perhaps the simplest possible block cipher: XOR the plaintext with a prewhitening key, apply a publicly known unkeyed permutation (in practice, a pseudorandom permutation) to the result, and then XOR a postwhitening key to the permuted result to produce the final ciphertext.Joan Daemen, Laboratorium Esat. \\"Limitations of the Even‚ÄìMansour Construction\\". 1992.

Orr Dunkelman, Nathan Keller, and Adi Shamir later proved it was possible to simplify the Even‚ÄìMansour scheme even further and still retain the same provable security, producing the \\"single-key Even‚ÄìMansour scheme\\": XOR the plaintext with the key, apply a publicly known unkeyed permutation to the result, and then XOR the same key to the permuted result to produce the final ciphertext.

It was demolished in 1920 and the property redeveloped for the then owner's department store business.  History  The first Boyd's Opera House in Omaha was built in 1881 at 15th and Farnam Streets by James E. Boyd. In addition to serving as Nebraska's governor and Omaha's mayor, Boyd was a successful railroad and real estate developer. One of the first celebrities to appear at the original Boyd's was Oscar Wilde in 1882. After the original Boyd Opera House burned twelve years later, Boyd built his new 2,000-seat theater and opera house at 17th and Harney Streets. The new five story theater was constructed on an iron framework with a pressed red brick exterior. There was retail space on the street level, and office space within the interior. The total cost of construction and furnishings was $250,000. The Boyd Theater's stage was 78 feet wide, 40 feet deep and 60 feet high. The curtain drops were 26 feet by 46 feet. The proscenium was modeled after an ornate arch in the Taj Mahal. The theater was decorated in tones of sage green and soft tones of olive to complement the electric lighting throughout. There were 17 full sets of scenery when the theater opened on September 3, 1891. The first play presented on the house's stage was Alabama, with Thomas F. Boyd as the theater's manager. One particularly elaborate production of Henry V required the theater to accommodate 10 train cars of armour, 200 trunks of costumes, 167 professional actors and 21 full sets. Once local actors were added to the production, the cast ultimately rose to 300. The Boyd Theater was capable of handling even productions of this size. Some of the most prominent actors of the time appeared on the Boyd Theater's stage. English Shakespearean actors Sir Henry Irving and Dame Ellen Terry appeared twice in Omaha. The first time was April 20 and 21, 1900 with the productions of Merchant of Venice, Nance Oldfield and The Bells. Their second appearances occurred on December 31, 1901 and January 1, 1902. Other toasted performers to grace Boyd Theater's stage included: Otis Skinner, E. H. Sothern, John Drew, Walker Whiteside, Robert B. Mantell Joseph Jefferson, Leslie Carter, Julia Marlowe, Ethel Barrymore and Maude Adams. A man bled to death in the wings of the Boyd Theater during one performance, with no one in the audience the wiser. A song and dance man, Jim Mulligan, died after being stabbed by Arthur Sprague, a stage manager, after making an offensive comment about Mrs. Sprague. Sarah Bernhardt in La Tosca, circa 1887 In 1905, Sarah Bernhardt appeared on the Boyd Theater stage in La Tosca. Bernhardt traveled with her own custom railway car. Also traveling with her on the train was her own carriage, a team of black horses, and a French coachman and hostler. The entire city knew when Bernhardt was in town. Omaha-born pianist Frances Nash, who would later marry Edwin Watson, friend and senior advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, often performed at Boyd's Theater. The man primarily responsible for the quality and the variety of the shows appearing on the Boyd Theater's stage was William J. Burgess. Burgess had been involved in theaters since the age of 12. He initially came to Omaha to manage the Grand Opera House and later managed the original Boyd Theater. When the Creighton Orpheum Theater opened, he served as its manager for two years. Once that theater joined the Orpheum Circuit, he took over the management of the second Boyd Theater and set about making it the premier live theater venue in Omaha. He introduced the first mail-order tickets in town and strived to book the premier acts. He even opened an acting school for fledgling dramatists. But even Burgess's efforts could not sway the audiences changing tastes towards motion pictures and the rising costs of mounting a live stage production. In 1914, Boyd's Theater was sold to the Burgess-Nash Company for $231,000. Initially they continued to manage it as a theater, but as the competition from talking movies increased, the company eventually closed the theater. The last performance in the theater was on February 2, 1920. It was demolished in 1920 and the property redeveloped for their department store business. Currently, the property houses the Omaha Public Power District's downtown office.

He is noted for his front-running style and has won seven of his thirteen races. After beginning his racing career on the amateur point-to-point circuit he became the dominant National Hunt Flat performer in Britain and Ireland in 2012, winning the Champion Bumper and the Champion INH Flat Race. In the following season he was campaigned in novice hurdle races and won two more Grade I races, the Deloitte Novice Hurdle in Ireland and Supreme Novices' Hurdle in England. In his first season over steeplechase fences he won one minor race and finished second in the Arkle Challenge Trophy and in the following year he added win in the Clonmel Oil Chase and Red Mills Chase. Background Champagne Fever is a grey gelding bred in Ireland by John P. Cahill and John Walsh. He was sired by Stowaway, who won the Gordon Stakes and the Great Voltigeur Stakes in 1997. Stowaway has made some impact as a National Hunt stallion, also siring Hidden Cyclone, winner of four Graded races in Ireland. Champagne Fever's dam Forever Bubbles was unraced. As a three-year-old gelding, Champagne Fever was sent to the Tattersalls Ireland sale in June 2010 and was bought for ‚Ç¨17,500 by Michael O'Mara. He was subsequently acquired by Rich and Sussanah Ricci and sent into training with Willie Mullins in County Carlow. Racing career =2011/2012 National Hunt season: National Hunt Flat races= Before competing under National Hunt rules, Champagne Fever made an appearance on the amateur point- to-point circuit winning over three miles at the Quakerstown meeting on 24 April 2011. When the 2011/2012 National Hunt season began, Champagne Fever was campaigned in National Hunt Flat races, also known as \\"bumpers\\" starting at Leopardstown Racecourse on 26 December when he was ridden by his trainer's son Patrick Mullins and finished second to Thomas Edison. Mullins was again in the saddle when Champagne Fever reappeared in a bumper at Fairyhouse in January. He started the 1/4 favourite and led from the start to win \\"comfortably\\" by thirteen lengths. On 14 March Champagne Fever started a 16/1 outsider for the Grade I Champion Bumper at the Cheltenham Festival. Mullins sent him into the lead after a furlong and held off several challengers to win by one and a quarter lengths from the favourite New Year's Eve. The New One and Jezki finished sixth and eighth respectively. After the race, Mullins said that \\"Champagne Fever has a huge cruising speed and that is where we went wrong with him first time out. Last time we made all and we decided to do the same today\\". In the following month, Champagne Fever started 11/4 favourite for the Grade I Champion INH Flat Race at the Punchestown Festival. As at Cheltenham, he led throughout the race, and after being challenged on the final turn, he drew away to win by seven and a half lengths from Melodic Rendezvous. Mullin described the winner as \\"a super horse. He just gallops all day, he obviously stays well, he jumps well so he's one we're really looking forward to. He has huge ability and I have considered going straight over fences with him. We could do what we did with Florida Pearl\\". =2012/2013 National Hunt season: Novice hurdles= In the 2012/2013 National Hunt season Champagne Fever was campaigned in novice hurdle races. He made his debut over obstacles at Cork Racecourse on 18 November and led from the start to win easily by five lengths at odds of 1/8. The gelding was ridden by Ruby Walsh for the first time when he started 11/8 favourite for the Grade I Royal Bond Novice Hurdle at Fairyhouse in December. As usual, he attempted to lead from the start but was overtaken at the last hurdle and beaten one and a half lengths by Jezki. In the Grade II Slaney Novice Hurdle at Naas Racecourse in January he started 1/4 favourite but ran poorly and finished third, forty lengths behind the winner Rule The World. Champagne Fever returned to winning form in the Grade I Deloitte Novice Hurdle at Leopardstown in February. Ridden by Paul Townend, he ran in his customary style, leading throughout the race and winning by one and three quarter lengths from Bright New Dawn at odds of 2/1. The gelding returned to the Cheltenham Festival for the Grade I Supreme Novices' Hurdle on 12 March 2013 and started second favourite alongside Jezki at odds of 5/1 behind the A. P. McCoy-ridden favourite My Tent Or Yours. Ridden by Walsh, he led for most of the race before being overtaken at the final hurdle. He \\"rallied gamely\\" to regain the lead on the run-in and won by half a length from My Tent Or Yours, with Jezki two and a quarter lengths back in third. Walsh said \\"I knew AP was coming to me and I could hear the crowd roar but he jumped like a stag and he stuck his neck out and went away again\\". Champagne Fever ended his season in the Evening Herald Champion Novice Hurdle at Punchestown in April. He started favourite but was overtaken at the last and finished third behind Jezki and Ted Veale. =2013/2014 National Hunt season: Novice chases= In December 2013, Champagne made his first appearance in a steeplechase when he started 4/7 favourite for a novice event at Punchestown. He led from the start and survived two jumping errors to win by four lengths from Corbally Ghost. On 26 December, the grey started 8/15 favourite for the Grade I Racing Post Novice Chase at Leopardstown. He disputed the lead for much of the race but after a bad mistake at the second last he finished third behind Defy Logic and Trifolium. Champagne Fever made his third appearance at the Cheltenham Festival on 11 March when he started 11/4 joint favourite with Trifolium for the Arkle Challenge Trophy in a field which also included the 2012 Champion Hurdle winner Rock On Ruby. He took the lead at the first fence and maintained his advantage until the final strides, in which he was caught and beaten a head by the 33/1 outsider Western Warhorse. On his final appearance of the season, the gelding started 5/4 favourite for the Ryanair Novice Chase at Punchestown but finished sixth of the seven runners behind the British-trained six-year-old God's Own. =2014/2015 National Hunt season: Steeplechases= On his first appearance against more experienced chasers, Champagne Fever started 8/11 favourite against six opponents in the Clonmel Oil Chase over two and a half miles on 13 November. Ridden by Paul Townend, he was among the leaders from the start and went clear of his rivals at the second last to win by six lengths from Alderwood with Sizing Europe twelve and a half lengths back in sixth place. Townend said that the winner \\"jumped like a buck\\" whilst Mullins expressed himself \\"delighted\\" at the performance and added that \\"the ultimate aim is the Gold Cup\\". The elding was then sent to England for the King George VI Chase over three miles on 26 December. Starting the 9/2 second favourite, he tracked the leader Silviniaco Conti until the last fence but faded in the closing stages to finish fourth of the eight finishers. On his return to Ireland he started odds-on favourite for the Kinloch Brae Chase at Thurles, but fell at the last fence when disputing the lead with the eventual winner Don Cossack. In the Red Mills Chase on 14 February, Champagne Fever started 8/15 favourite against four opponents. He took the lead at the ninth of the fourteen fences, opened up a clear advantage, and was eased down by Paul Townend in the closing stages to win by four and a quarter lengths. The gelding was sent to England in March to contest the Queen Mother Champion Chase, but failed to recover from being bitten on the lip by a stablemate on the flight from Ireland and was unable to take part in the race. In April he traveled to Aintree Racecourse for the first time and started joint-favourite for the Melling Chase. He tracked the leaders before moving forward at the fourth last but made a mistake at the next and finished fourth, more than thirty lengths behind the winner Don Cossack. For the third season in succession, Champagne Fever failed to produce his best form at the Punchestown Festival, finishing fifth behind his stablemate Felix Yonger in the Punchestown Champion Chase. =2016/2017 National Hunt season: Steeplechases= Champagne Fever did not race in the 2015/16 season. He made his first appearance for 576 days when he ran in the Listed Boomerang Animal Bedding and Boomerang Horse & Country Store Chase over 2 miles and 6 furlongs at Thurles on 24 November 2016. He was sent off 11/8 second favourite in the betting behind Wounder Warrior. Champagne Fever, ridden as usual by Ruby Walsh, won by a head from the 2014 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, Lord Windermere. Willie Mullins stated after the race \\"He always runs well on his first run back and we'll probably look for a similar race over two and a half miles\\".

They disbanded in 2009 after completing a trilogy of concept albums‚Äî Owsla (2006), Elil (2007), and Inl√© (2009) ‚Äî inspired by the mythology of the 1972 novel Watership Down.  Biography  Originally from Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, the quintet was formed with the intention of recording a trilogy of albums, entitled The Warren of Snares, based on an interpretation of the mythology present within the 1972 novel Watership Down by Richard Adams. The trilogy is composed of the albums Owsla, Elil and Inl√©, co-produced by several labels. In the novel, Efrafa is a rabbit colony ruled by a dictator, who oppresses rebels through his elite police, the Owsla. In the context of the bands concept, Owsla represents the populace around which the story revolves, the Efrafa representing humanity. In the clutches of a theocratic dictatorship, their society is on the brink of collapse. With the encroachment of the Efrafa, an invasive species, this dictatorship turns to blind faith, obedience and punishment for answers. The story records the uprising by those who defy the word of rule and religion, culminating in not only the dethronement of their leader, but a futile charge against the Efrafa. The band presents their political and social ideology, which includes references to animal rights (they all are vegans) and deeply held atheism; they also attack humanity's destructive habits, while analysing their relationship with religion and fight against tyranny. Among their influences, the band cites Agalloch, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, His Hero Is Gone and Neurosis. The trilogy is cyclical and runs in reverse; with Owsla representing the climax and eventual rebirth of the story. This is signified by a passage of cello which bookends the trilogy - representing the eventual rise and fall of empires and our inability to learn from past mistakes. The band's first album, Owsla, came out in 2006, alternating the D-beat of emo crust with the melancholic melody of post-rock, along with some post metal influences. The album title is a word in lapine language that in the novel corresponds to the elite warriors of the warren, who very often take advantage of their position by abusing their power over other rabbits. In the context of the record, the Owsla is a name bestowed upon all by their despotic leader, in a cynical move to give his people a false sense of empowerment. This record documents the final charge against the Efrafa. The second album, Elil (in lapine language, \\"enemy\\"), released the following year, is divided into 3 songs, all of them over 20 minutes. The music moves through post rock/ post metal passages and a slower more brooding melodic crust, expressing a bleak melancholy atmosphere, progressively taking inspiration from doom metal. The concept continues with a view of the psychology of those within a society fighting religious oppression, both internal and external. The last release, Inl√©, came out in 2009. The doom metal frame that was only an influence in the previous works of the band, becomes the predominant genre, creating sonic images of emotion and desolation. The black cover and the album title, featuring Inl√©, the black rabbit of death, anticipating the atmosphere of this work divided into 7 melancholic and gloomy tracks. Stylistically, the doom metal and post-rock are the main reference points and replace the speed of D-beat hardcore with introspective melody. The story begins with this record, a society on the brink of self-destruction, a maniacal ruler wielding theocratic ideology, oppressing and abusing, offering nothing in the face of a much greater threat, the encroachment of humanity upon their land. After releasing this album the band parted ways, as their only goal was to release this trilogy. Their discography was later published in a boxset called The Warren of Snares Trilogy. Their last concert was in Brighton, on 5 December 2009.Fall of Efrafa  MySpace.com Singer Alex CF later formed a number of concept bands, including Momentum, Light bearer, Anopheli, Archivist and Morrow. Guitarists Steve McCusker and Neil Kingsbury went on to start Brighton-based drone rock band Blackstorm (2007-2014) with Kingsbury going on to play in Orange Goblin as an additional live guitarist in 2013 and for the 20th Anniversary shows for Desertfest in 2015 then bass for Earthtone9 in 2016 to 2018. In addition to the trilogy they have also produced 3 EP's: a split with Down to Agony (2007), Tharn (a collaboration with Paper Aeroplane) (2008) and The Burial (2009), and a DVD with footage of their only U.S. tour, their final show at Westhill Hall in Brighton, UK on 5 December 2009, and photographs and artwork (non-audio).

Hastings, Statistician and Developer of the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings Algorithm Early life and education He received his B.A. in applied mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1953, and then worked from 1955 to 1959 for the Toronto company H.S. Gellman & Co. Hastings received his M.A. in 1958, and his Ph.D. in 1962, both from the University of Toronto's department of mathematics (which included statistics at that time). His Ph.D. thesis title was \\"Invariant Fiducial Distributions\\". His Ph.D. supervisor was initially Don Fraser and later Geoffrey Watson.

His works include bibliographies on Indian encyclopedias, on manuals and gazetteers of India, and on the Portuguese in India. He also authored other scholarly works, plays and novels, as well as his own memoirs.  Life  = India = Henry Cedric Scholberg was born in Darjeeling, British India, on May 29, 1921 and grew up speaking Hindi before he could speak English. Bearing the same first name as his father, Henry Caesar Scholberg, he was known as Cedric from childhood until the 1950s. His parents were patriotic Methodist missionaries from the United States, working at a time of considerable turmoil during the campaign for Indian independence. His childhood experiences, and in particular the acts of Mahatma Gandhi, influenced his pacifist tendencies: Todd Tucker says that as a child Scholberg \\"personally witnessed how nonviolent tactics could bring about concrete political change. The experience would stay with him his entire life.\\" Scholberg attended Woodstock School, a Presbyterian boarding school in Mussoorie that commonly took the children of missionaries. He found it to be a miserable experience at times. In a naive gesture, reflecting the commonplace antipathy towards British governance in India and despite his pacifism, he was among a group of schoolboys who executed the Nazi salute on being told by their headmaster of the beginnings of World War II; Germany was opposed to Britain and that was sufficient justification in their minds. = United States = After finishing at Woodstock in 1939, Scholberg left his parents in India, sailing on the to enroll at the University of Illinois, close to where his sister lived. His attendance enabled him to avoid military conscription until 1943 when he graduated with a B.A. in History. At that time, he registered as a conscientious objector, much to the annoyance of his parents. As an objector, Scholberg was ordered to join the Civilian Public Service (CPS), through which he became one of the test subjects in the Minnesota Starvation Experiment from 1944. This was his first experience of the University of Minnesota, having previously had CPS postings in a conservation camp at Lagro, Indiana, and a mental institution in Maryland. He saw the Experiment as a relief from his work in mental health, which was increasingly giving him concern about his own mental state, and as a sacrifice befitting that being made by those of his countrymen who were engaged in the war. He later said that When he underwent a psychological assessment for acceptance on the Experiment, based on the then new Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory method, it was determined that he had psychotic tendencies, including depression, hypochondria and hysteria. He became one of the 36 selected test subjects, another of whom was Jasper \\"Jay\\" Garner, who by chance happened to have been at Woodstock School with Scholberg as an eight-year-old. Scholberg enrolled in graduate-level courses to learn French while he was involved in the year-long experiment, having soon exhausted the possibilities of the beginners' classes that were offered by a fellow test subject, the Princeton University graduate Sam Legg. During the course of the experiment, his weight dropped from to . In 1954, Scholberg was awarded a B.S. in Social Sciences from the University of Minnesota. He added an M.A. in Library Science from the same university in 1962. After some time spent as a librarian and athletics coach at Columbia Heights High School in Minnesota, Scholberg returned to the University of Minnesota in 1961 as the first director of the Ames Library of South Asia, whose collection had recently been donated to the university by Charles Leslie Ames. A series of promotions through the academic ranks led to him becoming a full professor in 1979. He became a professor emeritus when he retired in 1986, at which time he also relinquished his position as director of the library. During his time in office, the library's collections grew from 25,000 items to over 105,000. Scholberg died on August 4, 2012, in New Brighton, Minnesota, six years after suffering head injuries in a cycling accident. Among his caregivers at the nursing home were people from Nepal, who gave him much pleasure by speaking to him in Hindi, the tongue that he always considered to be his first language. His wife of 61 years, Phyllis, survived him. The couple had three children.  Works  = Academic = Scholberg said of researching archives and living abroad in the pursuit of academic knowledge that \\"If you're not enjoying it, you are not doing it right.\\" He traveled to over 40 countries, often with his family, and had extended periods of residence in India (1964 and 1976) and Paris (1967 and 1969). He spent four years researching The District Gazetteers of British India: A Bibliography, which was tied in with a large-scale attempt by the International Documentation Company to publish on microfilm the censuses, gazetteers and reports of the British colonial period. It was that company which published his work in 1970. He noted that there were around 1300 gazetteers produced by the British in India between 1822 and 1947, when the country gained independence. Intended for administrative use as well as for the general public, they can only loosely be described as systematic and they were not all published by government bodies. The methods, styles, and formats of compilation varied even within districts. His bibliography, which included brief histories of how their compilation evolved and attempts to identify the myriad of authors and editors, is arranged by province or its administrative equivalent and, according to a review by N. Gerald Barrier, \\"surmounts substantial organisational problems\\" and is a \\"painstaking study\\". Barrier was critical of some aspects of the work, citing as examples the omission of a substantially revised gazetteer for Amritsar and also the lack of information relating to pagination or publication, other than date. Barrier also notes that the completeness of the work was marred because Scholberg may not have had access to S. B. Chaudhuri's History of the Gazetteers, which had been published in 1965. Scholberg's Bibliographie des Fran√ßais dans l'Inde was published in 1973 by the Historical Society of Pondicherry. His co-author was Emmanuel Divien. In 1982, Promilla published a bibliography of Goa and the Portuguese in India, being the collaborative work of Scholberg, Archana Kakodker, and Carmo Azevedo. This represented eight years' of work, identified sources in over 80 locations, in numerous languages, and included unpublished doctoral theses and material dating as far back as the 16th century. More than of travel was necessary for its compilation. John Villiers noted in a review that Scholberg had already demonstrated \\"ample evidence of his abilities as a bibliographer\\" and that this bibliography included various papers written by experts on aspects of Indo-Portuguese historiography. Scholberg's work on India encyclopedias - The Encyclopedias of India - was published by Promilla in 1986 and was described by a reviewer, Ruth Bowden, as an \\"encyclopedia of encyclopedias\\". It detailed 47 such works, produced between around the tenth- century AD and the 20th century. These comprised various languages, including one in Assamese, six in Bengali, three in Gujarati, four in Hindi, three in Kannada, four in Malayalam, six in Marathi, five in Oriya, one in Punjabi, six in Sanskrit, two in Tamil, four in Telegu, and two in Urdu.

Description The Ledrinae are mostly green or brown with a flattened body and tibiae. The ocelli are located near the crown and the forewings have a dense network of veins. Tribes and Genera The subfamily contains around 500 species which are divided into 5 to 7 tribes depending on the taxonomy followed. A 2009 revision treats the subfamily as having five tribes. The Afrorubrini are found only in southern Africa with 2 genera; the Hespenedrini has a single genus in Chile; Rubrini with a single genus in Australia; and two larger tribes that have a more widespread distribution, especially the Ledrini.

Vela, who served as the Mayor of Brownsville from 1999 until 2003, was the city's first female mayor. She remains the only woman to hold the mayoral office to date. Vela was married to the late United States federal judge Filemon Vela Sr., while her three children include U.S. Rep. Filemon Vela Jr. (D-Texas). Early life and education Vela was born Blanca Sanchez in Harlingen, Texas, on May 27, 1936. Her parents, Luis M. Sanchez and Maria R. \\"Cuca\\" Sanchez, were Mexican immigrants who moved to the United States from Linares, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Zacatecas, respectively, when both were teenagers. They first met each other in Harlingen. Her father worked for the Missouri Pacific Railroad while her mother worked as a homemaker. Blanca Sanchez, who was the eldest of her parents' nine children, was raised in Harlingen. She married her husband, Filemon Vela, Sr., in 1962. He was later appointed a U.S. federal judge on the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The couple had three children: Filemon Vela, Jr., Rafael (Ralph), and Sylvia. Vela began her college career by taking the bus from Harlingen to Brownsville to attend Texas Southmost College, a community college. She later earned both her bachelor's degree and a master's degree. Career =Public service= Prior to her election as mayor in 1999, Vela served on the Brownsville Public Utilities Board (PUB), including a stint as the board's chairperson from 1995 until July 1998. She and Betty Dodd co-founded of the Brownsville Public Library Foundation in 1994. Blanca Vela also became the first woman to hold a seat on the Brownsville National Bank's board of directors. =Mayor of Brownsville= Vela announced her candidacy for Mayor on August 28, 1998, as a challenger to incumbent Mayor Henry Gonzalez, who was seeking re-election for a third term. She defeated Gonzalez in the city's mayoral election on May 1, 1999. Vela garnered 3,003 votes (56%), while Gonzalez placed second with 2,379 votes (44%). On January 7, 2003, Mayor Blanca Vela announced that she would not seek re-election for a second term in a speech in front of the Market Square fountain. Her departure set off a competitive 2003 mayoral campaign between city commissioner Eddie Trevi√±o and former Mayor Henry Gonzalez. Trevi√±o and Gonzalez placed first and second (out of four candidates) in the election held on May 3, 2003, which qualified them for the runoff. In the runoff election held on June 7, 2003, Trevi√±o won 4,377 votes (64.13%), defeating Gonzalez, who earned 2,448 votes (35.86%) to succeed Vela as mayor. Vela left office on June 10, 2003. Vela issued as statement thanking her family and the citizens of the city as her last act in office. In a speech following his oath of office on the same day, her successor, Mayor Eddie Trevi√±o Jr., thanked Vela for her service as his first act as mayor. Vela's official portrait, which was hung in commission chambers, was also unveiled on June 10. Vela died of natural causes at her home in Brownsville on February 16, 2014, at the age of 78. She was survived by her three children, Sylvia, Ralph, and U.S. Congressman Filemon Vela Jr. Her husband, Judge Filemon Vela, Sr., died on April 13, 2004.

It was aired on March 12, 2014. The episode was written by Megan Ganz and directed by Jim Hensz. As the episode's title suggests, the theme of the episode is sharing experiences with the children of others and the importance of removing oneself from his or her comfort zone. Plot Cam (Eric Stonestreet) and Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) take Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Alex (Ariel Winter) to a modern art museum. Cam has studied the exhibit at home so he will be prepared for the day but when they get there he finds out that the subject he had studied was temporary, making him feel the dumbest of the group. He tries to find a way to leave and he finally admits the truth to Mitch and leaves in the middle of the tour. Mitch follows him a little later and then Manny. Alex is the last to give up. They decide to take a meal but after Alex accidentally spreads mustard on her shirt, Cam decides to compare her to Kandinsky which leads his niece to attack him with mustard. Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) and Claire (Julie Bowen) take Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) to buy a flower dress for her daddies' wedding. They take her to a store with classic dresses but Lily wants to wear a princess dress she saw in another store. While being there, Claire tells Gloria that she did not wear a wedding dress at her wedding and Gloria makes her try one on. Claire tries on a dress and while the two women talk about it, Lily disappears and they start searching for her in the entire Mall. They find her wearing the princess dress she had seen earlier and they decide to call Cam and Mitch to ask them if they are fine with Lily not wearing a classic flower dress because Lily looks so happy with the princess one. Phil (Ty Burrell) offers to help Andy (Adam DeVine) make a special gift to his girlfriend. They go to Phil's house and set up a scenery with green screen so Phil can shoot Andy saying and doing special things and then, with computer programs, add the necessary background. Haley (Sarah Hyland) is there watching them while waiting for her date to pick her up and thinks that what they do is stupid but she ends up helping them in one of the scenes. Her date is revealed to be mean and does not apologize for being late. Haley dumps him and changes her mind about Andy saying that he is sweet but she freaks out as Alex notices that he is somewhat like Phil. Jay (Ed O'Neill) gets to spend the day with Luke (Nolan Gould) and tries to teach him how to use tools and do some basic woodworking.

Joshua Alston from The A.V. Club gave a B+ rating to the episode, saying that although it probably had potential to be funnier, it was still a solid episode of television. \\"‚ÄúOther People‚Äôs Children‚Äù is a Modern Family episode that makes me suspect this show has been better and more consistent than many people, myself included, give it credit for.

Life  In 1838, he was already an apprentice draftsman at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. From 1839 to 1844, he was a student of Gustave Wappers. He took a study trip through Germany and Italy in 1852. Two years later, he was appointed to a position as a painting instructor at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp). His notable students included Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Alo√Øs Boudry, Gerard Portielje, Henri Van Dyck and Piet Verhaert. In 1861, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Leopold and in 1869 became a Knight in the Order of St.Michael. In 1875, he was diagnosed with meningitis. The following year, he died in Mechelen, where he had gone for treatment.  Work  Van Lerius painted mythological and biblical scenes as well as portraits and genre pictures. Much of his work is didactic in nature. In 1852 Queen Victoria bought his painting \\"Premier N√©\\" (First Born), depicting a young couple with a baby. It is still on display at Windsor Castle. Perhaps his best-known work is \\"Lady Godiva\\", which was shown at the Antwerp Triennial Salon in 1870. It was purchased by London art dealer Henry Graves.

It is found in Australia. It is sometimes known as the craypot stinkhorn or basket stinkhorn, a reference to the unique appearance of the fruiting bodies which consist of vivid red, wrinkled arms that branch and connect to form a cage-like structure reminiscent to that of the related species Clathrus ruber. This fungus is saprobic and makes frequent appearances on garden mulch as a result. Like all stinkhorns, the fruit body of C. pusillus begins as an egg-like structure. The eggs of C. pusillus are typically off-white, with a red/purple tinge and a faint latticed pattern on the surface. They are anchored to the substrate by one or more root-like rhizomorphs: thickened mycelial strands. The membrane of the \\"egg\\" soon ruptures, releasing the rapidly expanding mature receptacle, which can reach a height of around 15 cm. The interior of the cage is covered by an unevenly distributed glebal slime, which contains the fungal spores. This slime is olive-green in colour and has a foul smell, which attracts insects that distribute the fungus' spores to a suitable location.

She outlived all of her siblings, her brothers Edward (general merchant), Sir David Baxter, 1st Baronet, John, and William (who worked in their father's textile business), and her sister Eleanor. Notable achievements Mary Ann Baxter was the co-founder of University College, Dundee, the forerunner of the University of Dundee and also, with her brother, Sir David Baxter (1793-1872) of the Technical Institute of Dundee which opened in 1888 and led to the founding of Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design. The Deed of endowment and trust in the University archives, signed in 1881 when Mary Ann Baxter would have been 80 years old, lists the donation of ¬£120,000 for the creation of an institution of higher education in Dundee from Miss Mary Ann Baxter of Balgavies assisted by her relative, Dr John Boyd Baxter, Esq., LL.D., an alumnus of St Andrews and Procurator Fiscal of Forfarshire who contributed nearly ¬£20,000. The deed stated that the college should promote \\"the education of persons of both sexes and the study of Science, Literature and the Fine Arts\\". Mary Ann Baxter's insistence on the education of women meant that the college's alumni include the social reformer Mary Lily Walker and Scotland's first female professor, Margaret Fairlie.

Biography Guy graduated from the University of Illinois circa 1929, earned his master's degree from the University of Missouri in 1934, and received his PhD in 1940 from the University of Illinois. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Guy enlisted into the United States Army Air Corps in January 1942.Guys War Amy Smith. (2012). He was first sent to an air base in San Antonio, Texas. Soon after, he was shipped overseas, eventually ending up in India, where he worked on building the Ledo Road. Ledo Road was considered one of the toughest jobs during the war by General Lewis A. Pick, because of the physical labor and harsh conditions of the landscape.The Ledo Road Carl Warren Weidenburner. (2014). The road served as a land supply route to China, via the Burma Road. Upon returning from his service to the US military, Guy was hired to work for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In 1946, Guy worked as a soil correlator for the Soil Conservation Service in Iowa, and in 1952 he was made Director of Soil Survey Investigations. As part of his duties, he traveled the world studying and describing soils for the U.S. government. While working for the USDA, Guy was tasked with developing a method for classifying soils. He produced the 1st of seven iterations of what would eventually become a soil taxonomy system used worldwide. Creating a way to classify soils was important because soils are a valuable global resource that we needed to better understand in order to utilize and improve upon. Guy collaborated with European soil scientists in developing Soil Taxonomy. For this and other research publications, Guy received international recognition for his outstanding efforts in soil science. For his contributions to pedology, Guy received many honors and awards. These include the Department of Agriculture's Distinguished Service Award in 1962, and the Soil Research Award from the American Society of Agronomy in 1964. He was awarded a Doctor of Science degree by the University of Ghent (Belgium) in 1968. Guy retired from the Soil Conservation Service in 1973.

History The original Jarrow club were formed in 1894 after Jarrow Rangers folded.Jarrow Donmouth Having initially been accepted into the Tyneside League, the new club successfully applied to join the Northern Alliance for the 1894‚Äì95 season.Northern Alliance 1890‚Äì1915 Non-League Matters Their first match on 22 August was a friendly against Bill Quay Albion, with Jarrow winning 3‚Äì0. The club were Northern Alliance runners-up in 1897‚Äì98 and won the league the following season, also reaching the first round of the FA Cup; drawn away to First Division club Everton, they lost 3‚Äì1. In 1899‚Äì1900 they reached the first round again, losing 2‚Äì0 at home to Millwall Athletic in front of a crowd that reached 8,000. The season also saw them win the Durham Challenge Cup, beating Sunderland 'A' 1‚Äì0 in the final. Having turned amateur in 1901, Jarrow left the Northern Alliance at the end of the 1901‚Äì02 season and subsequently disbanded. Although the club was reformed and rejoined the Northern Alliance in 1903, they resigned from the league in March 1909 with their record expunged. At the start of the following season a club named Jarrow Croft joined the North Eastern League.North Eastern League 1906‚Äì1933 Non-League Matters Croft had previously played in the South Shields Junior League and the Northern Amateur League, before winning the Newcastle Amateur League in 1909‚Äì10. The club were renamed Jarrow in 1912, and for the first two years of World War I they played in the North Eastern League‚ÄìTyneside Combination. After the war the club were renamed Palmers Jarrow, before reverting to simply Jarrow in March 1920. They finished bottom of the North Eastern League in 1923‚Äì24, and moved to Campbell Park in Hebburn the following season; plans to rename themselves Jarrow and Hebburn were dropped after the Durham FA refused permission. In 1930‚Äì31 another FA Cup first round appearance ended in a 1‚Äì0 defeat at Third Division North club Crewe Alexandra. Jarrow won the Durham Challenge Cup for a second time in 1932‚Äì33, beating Spennymoor United 2‚Äì1 in the final. They retained the trophy the following season with a 1‚Äì0 win over Cockfield in the final and were also North Eastern League runners-up.North Eastern League 1933‚Äì1964 Non-League Matters The loss of their Campbell Park ground to the army in March 1939 led to the club resigning from the league at the end of the 1938‚Äì39 season. After World War II Jarrow rejoined the Northern Alliance, but they withdrew from the league during the 1948‚Äì49 season after 23 matches.Northern Alliance 1919‚Äì1960 Non-League Matters They dropped into the Northern Combination and subsequently disappeared.

First released in South Korea on May 28, 2014, it is a successor to 2013's LG G2. Inheriting design elements from the G2, such as its thin screen bezels and rear-mounted power and volume buttons, the G3 is distinguished primarily by being the first smartphone from a major manufacturer to incorporate a 1440p display, and its inclusion of an infrared hybrid autofocus system for its camera. LG also touted the device's plastic \\"metallic skin\\"‚Äîdesigned to give the device a higher quality appearance, and a \\"simpler\\" user interface with an integrated intelligent personal assistant system. The battery can be quickly changed by the user, allowing charged spare batteries to be carried. The G3 received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the overall appearance, performance, and software of the device. LG was panned for using a faux metallic plastic instead of an actual metal material for its exterior. The 1440p display was also considered bleeding edge technology, citing poor brightness levels, high battery power consumption and the use of artificial sharpening. 10 million units of the G3 were sold in the device's first 11 months on sale.  Development  = Exterior = One of the major goals of the G3 was to provide a simpler overall experience than other smartphones; Jong-Seok Park, president of LG's mobile division, argued that \\"the smartest innovation in a fast-evolving smartphone market is creating harmony between advanced technology and a simplified user experience.\\" While developing the G3, LG designers produced at least 300 different design prototypes, with various button layouts, materials, and finishes. The company aimed to address criticisms faced by the G2's design‚Äîwhose \\"glossy\\" plastic chassis was panned for having a plain appearance and for attracting finger smudges. The finishing of the G3 was designed to look and feel like brushed metal, whilst resisting smudging and scratching, and not feeling cold to touch. While LG considered using the \\"self-healing\\" coating from the G Flex, LG's vice president of mobile design Chul Bae Lee stated that they could not use it without making the phone glossy. The rear buttons of the G2 were retained, but with a more circular shape that is separated from the camera area; the new design is intended to prevent users from accidentally smudging the camera lens when using the buttons. The thin bezels of the G3, along with its curved shape, are intended to help improve grip and make the device feel smaller than it actually is, given its screen size. = Battery optimizations = While the G3's battery has the same capacity as the G2, a subtly-curved \\"arc battery\\" had to be designed so it could fit under the G3's curved rear cover. To achieve battery life comparable to other \\"1080p flagship\\" devices‚Äîespecially given the significantly higher resolution of its screen, several optimization measures are implemented in the G3's software. These include capping the frame rate rendered when the screen is displaying static content, and underclocking the processor when the device is not running processor-intensive applications. With these optimizations, LG demonstrated that the G3 could play video for six and a half hours at full screen brightness on a single charge. = Laser auto focus = The laser autofocus system uses a component originally designed for LG robotic vacuums. The G3 incorporates a \\"laser autofocus\\" system, being among the first smartphones to incorporate such a feature. Based on technology that was being researched for the LG Roboking robotic vacuum cleaner line, but ultimately left unused, the system uses a cone-shaped infrared beam to map the depth and position of objects; this data can be combined with traditional autofocus mechanisms, and face detection capabilities. LG claimed that this system gave the G3 the fastest autofocus time of any smartphone, 276 milliseconds. Other recent phones, such as the HTC One (M8) and Samsung Galaxy S5, had boasted autofocus times of 300 milliseconds. The introduction of the laser into the G3's feature set occurred late in development, and the majority of the mockups were not designed to compensate for its presence, requiring additional tweaks to the phone's shape.  Specifications  = Hardware =  Exterior  The G3's exterior incorporates a scratch-resistant \\"metallic skin\\"‚Äîconsisting of polycarbonate finished to look and feel like brushed metal; despite being branded as \\"metallic\\", the G3's exterior does not use actual metal. The finishing is intended primarily to improve grip, and to make the rear casing less susceptible to fingerprint smudging. The G3 is available in black, white, gold, burgundy, and violet color finishes. Design elements from the G2 are retained by the G3, such as its rear-mounted volume and power buttons. In comparison to the G2, the buttons were given a flatter design with a new, rounded shape.  Display  The G3 features a , 1440p quad HD IPS LCD display‚Äîthe first major \\"global\\" smartphone to use such a display. As with the G2, the G3 was designed with minimal screen bezels to ensure a compact form.  Storage and chipsets  The G3 features a 2.5 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 system-on-chip; variants with 16 GB of internal storage have 2 GB of RAM, while variants with 32 GB of internal storage have 3 GB of RAM.  Battery  The G3 includes a 3,000mAh battery. Unlike with the predecessor LG G2, the G3's rear cover is removable, allowing the battery to be replaced, and storage to be expanded up to 200 GB with currently-available microSD cards.  Cameras  The G3's 13-megapixel rear-facing camera uses the Sony Exmor RS IMX135 image sensor model, includes optical image stabilization and a dual-tone flash, along with a hybrid autofocus system. The time-of-flight camera system, also known as ‚Äúlaser autofocus‚Äù, uses a thin infrared laser beam to calculate the distance between the camera and its subject. In situations where data from the infrared autofocus is unreliable, the camera falls back on contrast autofocus. LG touted that the hybrid system gave the G3 the then fastest focus time of then any smartphone, and that the infrared autofocus would also be beneficial in low-light situations. The LG G3 is the first mobile phone that is able to record optically stabilized 2160p (4K) video.  Wireless charging  The G3 natively supports Qi wireless charging, except on models sold in Korea and the United States due to restrictions imposed by carriers. Wireless charging is only available on models sold in these regions if the QuickCircle case accessory is installed.  Connectivity  802.11ac WiFi is supported, as is satellite navigation using GPS and GLONASS satellites. There are different models for different regions, with appropriate telephone bands, some models also having FM radio support. = Software = The LG G3 shipped with Android 4.4 \\"KitKat\\" and LG's proprietary user interface and software suite G UI. The G3's user interface was revised with a flatter visual appearance than the G2, \\"mature\\" color schemes, new icons and the use of Roboto as the default font. New software features introduced by the G3 include the intelligent personal assistant \\"Smart Notice\\"‚Äîwhich presents context-sensitive notifications and suggestions using natural language, the fitness tracker LG Health, an updated \\"Smart Keyboard\\" with adjustable key height and the ability to analyze the user's typing habits to personalize its behavior, remote device locking and wiping, and \\"Content Lock\\"‚Äîthe ability to store files in a secure, private area, either in internal storage or on the SD card. The G3's camera software also received a revised user interface; by default, most options are hidden, and photos can be taken by merely tapping on the subject in the viewfinder. The G3 also offers the background defocus tool \\"Magic Focus\\", and a gesture-activated self-timer mode for the front-facing camera. On November 9, 2014, LG announced that the G3 would receive an update to Android 5.0 \\"Lollipop\\". The update was first released in Poland and South Korea in November 2014. The availability and release dates of the update in other markets, such as Europe and North America, varied. The update re-styles the interface to adhere to Material design language and other changes introduced by Lollipop. It also adds syncing of periodic heart rate readings by G Watch R smartwatches with the LG Health app. In December 2015, LG began to release an update to Android 6.0 \\"Marshmallow\\". As of 2020, all variants of LG G3 are still supported by LineageOS and is upgradeable to Android 10 = Accessories = LG G3 Quick Circle Case Prior to the unveiling of the G3 itself, LG unveiled the device's QuickCircle Case accessory. A successor to the QuickWindow Case produced for the G2, the case consists of a flip cover with a circular window near the top. A glow effect around the rim of the window is used to signify notifications, and a number of apps‚Äîincluding the camera, music player, and phone‚Äîcan be used from a special circular interface without opening the phone. The case also enables the use of wireless charging on G3 models sold in Korea and the United States. In February 2015, LG introduced a virtual reality headset shell for the phone known as VR for G3. Compatible with the Google Cardboard ecosystem, it was distributed as a free accessory alongside G3 devices sold in South Korea following its release..  Reception  The G3 was met with positive reception from critics. The G3's plastic rear cover was praised for being less susceptible to fingerprint smudging than the G2 ‚Äî however, LG was criticized for using an imitation metal finish rather than actual metal. In comparison to smartphones explicitly marketed as phablets, such as the Galaxy Note series, the G3 was considered to be more \\"comfortable\\" and phone-like for its size due to its compact form and smooth exterior. The high-end hardware of the G3 was also noted, with Engadget describing its specifications as being \\"[like] an Android fan's wishlist\\", but that from a usability standpoint, the screen's size would \\"[definitely] be a stretch for some people\\". The revised appearance of the G3's user interface was praised for having a cleaner look and feel than previous iterations, although The Verge did acknowledge that more Android OEMs were standardizing the appearance of their interface designs to closer resemble the design used by Google's \\"stock\\" distribution of the Android operating system. The G3's display was praised for having good color reproduction, brightness, and viewing angles, with Engadget noting that its 1440p sample content \\"[looked] pin-sharp and beautifully recreated.\\" However, critics were mixed on whether the display provided any sufficient advantages or difference in quality over a 1080p display for everyday use, also given that content optimized for the resolution was not yet readily available. Ars Technica showed concern over the display's potential effects on battery usage, and argued that the Samsung Galaxy S5 had a better contrast ratio and was easier to see outdoors. Mobile Syrup regarded the G3's display quality as inferior to the preceding G2, noting the lower maximum brightness (including the G3's software-based screen dimming algorithms), reduced viewing angles and color richness, due to sacrifices that LG made to maintain the G3's battery life. Anandtech was also mixed, noting that the G3's display produced \\"obviously oversaturated colors in almost every situation\\", had a weaker backlight than the G2, and used a software edge enhancement system that resulted in noticeable visual artifacts. While asserting that the 1440p display affected battery life, it was noted that in comparison to its competitors, the G3's battery life was still \\"firmly above what we've seen from 2013 (Snapdragon 600) flagships\\". In its first eleven months on sale, nearly 10 million units of the G3 were sold.

The well known attributes of T. rex (its jaws, legs and overall body design) are often interpreted to be indicative of either a predatory or scavenging lifestyle, and as such the biomechanics, feeding strategies and diet of Tyrannosaurus have been subject to much research and debate. Feeding Bust in Naturhistorischen Museum Wien Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus rex is known to have been carnivorous due primarily to the shape of the teeth. A study conducted by Miriam Reichel of the University of Alberta found that the tyrannosaurs' dissimilar teeth had different uses depending on their size, placement, serrated edge and angle in the mouth. While the teeth at the front were specially designed for gripping and pulling, the teeth at the side of the jaw were meant to puncture and the teeth at the back were specialized to both slice pieces from its prey and force it to its throat. She also proposed that the banana-shaped teeth of Tyrannosaurus rex were designed to withstand the strain of violently struggling prey which would otherwise snap teeth that were sharp, flat and knife-like. In a study made by Stephan Lautenschlager and colleagues comparing Tyrannosaurus to fellow theropods Allosaurus and Erlikosaurus, it was calculated that Tyrannosaurus was capable of a maximum jaw gape of around 80 degrees; this enormous jaw gape was a necessary adaptation for a wide range of jaw angles to power the creature's strong bite. A study by Emily J. Rayfield from the University of Bristol further supported that Tyrannosaurus used the puncture and pull feeding strategy, where the Tyrannosaurus would startle its prey with a powerful bite and then drag its teeth back through its prey's flesh and bone. The study found that Tyrannosaurus had a bony skull that was well-adapted to withstand biting and shearing forces, with strong nasal bones that helped it withstand compression and shearing stresses and lacrimal bones that enabled the skull to withstand a variety of stresses. Her study also found that the maxilla jugal sutures found in Tyrannosaurus cheeks acted as shock absorbers. These joints had soft tissue that absorbed some of the stresses encountered when biting. This traded some of the skull's durability in return for enabling it to better protect the surrounding bones from damage when biting. The study also found that the skull redirected much of the strain from biting to the Tyrannosaurus skull's robust nasal bones. In his 2013 lecture, Thomas R. Holtz Jr. stated that fused nasal bones and the presence of incisors were some of the unique traits of Tyrannosaurus and its relatives. He stated that most reptiles do not have incisors, having teeth at the front of the jaw that are similar to those in the rest of the jaw, and suggested that these incisors were used to scrape the meat from bones. He also stated that Tyrannosaurus teeth were different from previous theropods because they were thick from side to side, and while the teeth of many other theropods had roots just as long as the crown, the teeth of Tyrannosaurus had roots that were twice as long as the crowns. He further states that the teeth of Tyrannosaurus didn't look like they were for cutting, but instead looked like they were for pulverizing, crushing and piercing. In 2012, a study of the jaws of Tyrannosaurus by biomechanical expert Karl Bates of the University of Liverpool and paleontologist Peter Falkingham of the Royal Veterinary College, London, and Brown University was published in Biology Letters. Bates and Falkingham used computer modeling to reconstruct Tyrannosauruss skull and relevant jaw musculature based on anatomical research on crocodilians and birds. From these reconstructions, it was estimated that Tyrannosaurus was likely capable of exerting a bite force of between 35,000 to 57,000 newtons (7,860‚Äì12,800 pounds, or 3.93‚Äì6.4 short tons), around ten times as great as the strongest alligator bite. However, other, heavier predators, such as the crocodilian Deinosuchus and the giant shark Megalodon, surpassed this bite in strength, having bite forces of 11.5 short tons and 20.5 short tons, respectively. The study also revealed that a juvenile Tyrannosaurus had a bite force of no more than 880 pounds of force, or 3,914.43 newtons, and that the bite became more powerful as the animal matured. This also supports the theory that juvenile Tyrannosaurus hunted different prey in a form of niche partitioning so as to avoid competition with the adults Additionally, research done by Greg Erikson and Paul Gignac et al and published in the journal Scientific Reports indicates that Tyrannosaurus could bite down with around 8,000 pounds of force when feeding, exerting a pressure of 431,000 pounds per square inch with their teeth. This adaptation allowed Tyrannosaurus to drive open cracks present in bone during repetitive, mammal-like biting and produce high-pressure fracture arcades, leading to catastrophic explosions of some bones and allowing the theropod to fully exploit the carcasses of other dinosaurs such as hadrosaurs and ceratopsians, giving it access to the mineral salts and marrow within bone that other carnivores in the same environment could not take advantage of. Studies published in 2019 on hadrosaur vertebrae from the Hell Creek Formation that were punctured by the teeth of what appears to be a late-stage juvenile Tyrannosaurus indicate that despite lacking the bone-crushing adaptations of the adults, young individuals were still capable of using the same bone-puncturing feeding technique as their adult counterparts. Scavenging The debate about whether Tyrannosaurus was an active predator or a pure scavenger, however, is as old as the debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosauruss close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have speculated that it was a predator; like modern large predators it would readily scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity. Paleontologist Jack Horner has been a major advocate of the idea that Tyrannosaurus was exclusively a scavenger and did not engage in active hunting at all, though Horner himself has claimed that he never published this idea in the peer reviewed scientific literature and used it mainly as a tool to teach a popular audience, particularly children, the dangers of making assumptions in science (such as assuming T. rex was a hunter) without using evidence.Novella, S. \\"Interview with Jack Horner.\\" The Skeptics Guide to the Universe. 14-OCT-2011. Accessed 24-OCT-2011, http://media.libsyn.com/media/skepticsguide/skepticast2009-10-14.mp3 Nevertheless, Horner presented several arguments in the popular literature to support the pure scavenger hypothesis: Cast of the braincase at the Australian Museum, Sydney * Tyrannosaur arms are short when compared to other known predators. Horner argues that the arms were too short to make the necessary gripping force to hold on to prey.The king of killers or fearsome freeloader? It is one of the big questions currently in palaeontology. Other paleontologists such as Thomas Holtz Jr. and James Farlow, however, gave examples of animals that do not use their forelimbs to hunt such as wolves, seriemas and secretarybirds. Holtz later stated that the use of forelimbs are not the only viable way of prey capture giving examples of modern predators such as canids and hyaenids (hyenas). He also cited other extinct animals such as the Diatryma (also known as Gastornis) and Phorusrhacids. Gregory S. Paul cited thylacines as another example. * Tyrannosaurs had large olfactory bulbs, suggesting a highly developed sense of smell which could sniff out carcasses over great distances, as modern vultures do. Because vultures are primarily scavengers, it has been suggested that such a highly developed sense of smell may imply that tyrannosaurs were as well. However, Farlow and Holtz have noted that a good sense of smell could also be used to detect live prey as well as for behaviors unrelated to food acquisition. Darla K. Zelenitsky, Francois Therrien and Yoshitsugu Kobayashi also discussed the Tyrannosauruss sense of smell in their 2009 study and stated that it was not an indication of a particular feeding strategy the animal was using (predator versus scavenger), but indicate that tyrannosaurids such as Tyrannosaurus were active during low light conditions and may have used their sense of smell to search for food and navigate through large home ranges. In a 2013 lecture, Holtz. also noted that like Tyrannosaurus, wolves and raptors such as Velociraptor also had a good sense of smell. Others have argued that the primary scavenger hypothesis is implausible because the only modern pure scavengers are large gliding birds, which use their keen senses and energy-efficient gliding to cover vast areas economically. However, researchers from Glasgow concluded that an ecosystem as productive as the current Serengeti would provide sufficient carrion for a large theropod scavenger, although the theropod might have had to be cold- blooded in order to get more calories from carrion than it spent on foraging (see Metabolism of dinosaurs). They also suggested that modern ecosystems like Serengeti have no large terrestrial scavengers because gliding birds now do the job much more efficiently, while large theropods did not face competition for the scavenger ecological niche from gliding birds. However, further research by the same scientists found that the evolution of a terrestrial obligate scavenger was unlikely (read more on Ruxton & Houson's 2004 study below). * Tyrannosaur teeth could crush bone, and therefore could extract as much food (bone marrow) as possible from carcass remnants, usually the least nutritious parts. Karen Chin and colleagues have found bone fragments in coprolites (fossilized feces) that they attribute to tyrannosaurs, but point out that a tyrannosaur's teeth were not well adapted to systematically chewing bone like hyenas do to extract marrow. Summary at Gregory Paul also wrote that a bone-crushing bite would also have been advantageous to a predator; providing the extreme bite force to kill prey and later consume it efficiently. Other paleontologists would also find similarities between Tyrannosaurus teeth and those of other predators. Farlow and Holtz pointed out that like Tyrannosaurus, orcas and crocodiles also had broad-based teeth. Holtz noted the similarities between Tyrannosaurus teeth and those of hyaenids, but further added that all hyaenids are known to kill prey, with the largest (Crocuta crocuta) obtaining most of its food through this means. He also notes that hyaenids mainly crunch bone with their molars and premolars. Holtz also pointed out that felids also developed thickened teeth as adaptations to resist contact with bone during prey capture or dispatch as well as during feeding. * Since at least some of Tyrannosauruss potential prey could move quickly, evidence that it walked instead of ran could indicate that it was a scavenger. On the other hand, recent analyses suggest that Tyrannosaurus, while slower than large modern terrestrial predators, may well have been fast enough to prey on large hadrosaurs and ceratopsians. Other evidence suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye-sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned so that the eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Horner also pointed out that the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision. It is not obvious why natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators. The damage to the tail vertebrae of this Edmontosaurus annectens skeleton (on display at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science) indicates that it may have been bitten by a Tyrannosaurus Furthermore, fossil evidence of tyrannosaur attacks on other dinosaurs have been discovered. A pair of hadrosaur caudal (tail) vertebrae found in 2007 was described by David Burnham et al in 2013 has the tip of an adult Tyrannosaurus tooth embedded in the bone, with evidence of new bone growth that wrapped around the tooth. Burnham and his colleagues suggest that this Edmontosaur had also survived a tyrannosaur attack and that this was further proof that Tyrannosaurus were predators.Subbaraman, Nidhi(2013, July 16).

The fact that the damage seems to have healed suggests that the Edmontosaurus survived a tyrannosaur's attack on a living target, i.e. the tyrannosaur had attempted active predation; however, the damage is ambiguous and not directly attributable to Tyrannosaurus. Another Edmontosaur specimen that is suspected to have survived a tyrannosaur attack had also been previously identified by Bruce Rothschild and Robert DePalma in an article published in the journal \\"Cretaceous Research\\".

It is not known what the exact nature of the interaction was, though: either animal could have been the aggressor. Since the Triceratops wounds healed, it is most likely that the Triceratops survived the encounter and managed to overcome the Tyrannosaurus. Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimated that in a battle against a bull Triceratops, the Triceratops had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the Tyrannosaurus using its sharp horns.Dodson, Peter, The Horned Dinosaurs, Princeton Press. p.19 Tyrannosaurus tooth marks on bones of various herbivores Various studies have also taken into account the ecosystem that Tyrannosaurus lived in. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. Top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics that only small dromaeosaurs and troodontids remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators. However, a study published in 2011 by Chris Carbone, Samuel T. Turvey and Jon Bielby found that Tyrannosaurus would have been unable to compete as an obligate scavenger against smaller theropods and it would have been necessary for it to primarily hunt large prey. In addition, a study by Graeme D. Ruxton and David C. Houson in 2004 found that vertebrates would need to be large bodied and capable of soaring flight to be obligate scavengers. This study also suggested the evolution of a terrestrial obligate scavenger was unlikely even with the absence of birds because for terrestrial carnivores there is a lack of strong selection pressure towards becoming an exclusive scavenger. The study further adds that it may always be more advantageous for terrestrial carnivores to be able to retain the flexibility of obtaining food through hunting and scavenging. A census study of the Hell Creek Formation published by John Horner, Mark B. Goodwin and Nathan Myhrvold in 2011 found that because of their relative abundance, tyrannosaurs were more like hyenas: opportunistic feeders that dined on more than just live prey and a specific group of dinosaurs. Brian Switek, however, held that this research did not overturn Tyrannosauruss image as a predator, noting that research has found that spotted hyenas obtained a majority of their food from hunting; scavenging as little as 5% in some locations. He also noted that the census is an imperfect depiction of the area's ecology since various biases in collecting and preservation may have affected the results. For example, Tyrannosaurus may have regularly destroyed the skeletons of Edmontosaurus which it preyed upon. Horner, Goodwin and Myhrvold's study, according to Switek, actually shows what most palaeontologists believe; that Tyrannosaurus was an opportunistic carnivore; an animal that both hunted and scavenged. However, the energetic importance of scavenging in Tyrannosaurus may have been mainly restricted to juvenile individuals as a recent study has shown that multi-ton theropods would have gained little energy from scavenging after accounting for the energy expended from foraging. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger like most large carnivores. David Hone of Queen Mary, University of London, for example, wrote in his blog that answering that it was either predator or scavenger in various papers has been unsatisfactory because it was most likely both. Switek also wrote that Tyrannosaurus was undoubtedly a predator and a scavenger, and that researchers have objected to the idea that Tyrannosaurus was an obligate scavenger and that there have only been a few studies to directly support the idea of Tyrannosaurus as an obligate scavenger. John Hutchinson, writing in his blog state that most scientists agree that Tyrannosaurus switched between being a predator and scavenger; not turning down a meal either dead or alive.  Hunting strategies  Edmontosaurus and a cast of the \\"Wankelrex\\" specimen, Houston Museum of Natural Science Various proposals have been made regarding the ways Tyrannosaurus may have hunted. Though adult tyrannosaurs are often depicted in art and other media as frequently attacking other giant dinosaurs, research suggests this type of behavior would have been rare. As with other carnivorous dinosaurs and modern carnivores in general, Tyrannosaurus probably preferred to target small prey animals, including juveniles of larger dinosaur species. A 2010 analysis by Hone & Rauhut suggested that this may partially explain the general lack of small and juvenile dinosaur skeletons in the fossil record. Tyrannosaurids like Tyrannosaurus appear to have been specialized to crush and likely ingest the bones of their prey, and predation of juvenile dinosaurs would therefore have left fewer skeletons to fossilize. Some studies also suggest that Tyrannosaurus preferred different prey at different stages of its life. In K. T. Bates and P. L. Falkingham's 2012 study, they found that there was a great disparity between the bite force of adult and juvenile Tyrannosaurus. According to the study, Tyrannosaurus only gained their powerful bite forces during their adulthood. This, according to the pair, suggest a difference in feeding ecologies between juveniles and adults; that the animals may have fed on different prey items at different stages of their lives. They propose that the powerful bite forces of adults may have allowed them to act as large prey specialists and thereby alleviate competition with younger tyrannosaurs. The juveniles according to the scientists were long-legged runners, but had relatively shallow skulls that were incapable of anchoring the muscles necessary to generate an adult Tyrannosauruss bite force. However, when the animals grew their jaw muscles grew exponentially to the point that these muscles were huge even for animals of their size. The scientists suggest that juveniles chased after small prey while adults had the power to prey on megaherbivores such as Edmontosaurus and Triceratops. The scientists call this phenomenon as resource partitioning which would have given Tyrannosaurus a large evolutionary advantage. Horner, Goodwin and Myhrvold's 2011 census makes a similar proposition, proposing that adult Tyrannosaurus may not have directly competed with juveniles if the possibility of scavenging increased with size as they aged. The University of Maryland's Thomas R. Holtz Jr. has proposed that Tyrannosaurus attacked prey like canids and hyaenids do; seizing and killing prey with the jaws, with limited use of the forelimbs for capture and dispatch. Holtz pointed out that Tyrannosaurus had stout, strong teeth and a bony palate; both of which would have enabled Tyrannosaurus to resist greater twisting loads and occasional bone contact than allosaurids or other typical theropods. Holtz elaborated that the incrassate (thickened) teeth of Tyrannosaurus were mechanically stronger than those of other theropods, with deep roots to withstand lateral forces during predation or feeding with a greater torsional component. Furthermore, Tyrannosaurus had a solidly built bony secondary palate found at the roof of its mouth that would also have strengthened it against torsional loads, a similar adaptation to that of crocodiles but uncommon amongst other theropods. In a lecture in 2013, Thomas Holtz Jr. would point out that torsion is encountered when biting into struggling prey and Tyrannosaurus resistance to torsional loads showed that it used a 'puncture and pull' method as opposed to the 'bite and slice' of many other theropods. He would also elaborate that like many reptiles, many dinosaurs did not have a hard palate. Tyrannosaurus, however, had a hard palate, just like mammals and crocodiles. Holtz along with James O. Farlow would also support freelance researcher Gregory S. Paul's suggestion that Tyrannosaurus could have used hit-and-run attacks on its prey. Denversaurus and the \\"Wyrex\\" specimen, Houston Museum of Natural Science Gregory S. Paul has suggested that Tyrannosaurus was a high-risk predator that also attacked massive and dangerous prey; citing this as a reason tyrannosaurs died young. He would indicate that the fossil evidence of animals that surviving tyrannosaur attacks show that these animals were at least healthy enough to heal from their injuries; even suggesting the possibility that some of them may have been able to kill the attacker. Paul wrote that Triceratops were probably Tyrannosauruss most challenging and dangerous prey; with horns and parrot like beaks that they could use for defence. and that Tyrannosaurus did not attack horned animals such as Triceratops head-on because that would have maximized the danger while lessening the chance of success. Instead Tyrannosaurus would attack these prey from behind, attempting to bite either the thigh or the caudofemoralis muscle to disable its prey. The Tyrannosaurus would have done this through either ambushing or trying to intimidate the horned animals into trying to run away which would have then exposed these animals to attack. Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops at Los Angeles Natural History Museum David A. Krauss and John M. Robinson proposed that Tyrannosaurus could have used a hunting strategy similar in concept to \\"cow tipping\\" against Triceratops, where the Tyrannosaurus would ambush and knock the Triceratops over to fall on its side. This strategy, according to the Krauss and Robinson could explain the unique characteristics of Tyrannosaurus. Tyrannosauruss small, yet strong arms could have been adapted to grasp onto the back of Triceratops while pushing with its pectoral region, its large clawed feet would have given it better traction, its large head could have been used to tip the Triceratops over and its large mouth and bone piercing teeth would have made bites to the side more efficient and deadly. When the Triceratops had fallen over to its side, Tyrannosaurus would then bitten it at the rib cage; killing it. Krauss and Robinson backed up their proposal through physical analyses; finding that Tyrannosaurus moving at moderate speed could have generated enough force to topple Triceratops and would have only taken 2‚Äì3 seconds. Their study suggested that a Tyrannosaurus impacting the Triceratops at a conservative estimated speed of 7.5 meters per second would have enabled it to topple Triceratops without injuring itself, though there could be some variance depending on the sizes of the animals (Tyrannosaurus could have attacked a smaller Triceratops). Furthermore, their study noted that Triceratops would have experienced some difficulty quickly getting back up from being toppled on to its side. According to the study, modern day analogues of Triceratops such as rhinoceros, camels and large bovids, experience the same kind of difficulty, taking 3‚Äì10 seconds to recover. But Triceratops may have experienced more difficulty due to its frill. According to the study, Tyrannosaurus arms were adapted for this strategy, pushing the prey with its chest while gripping it with its arms reduced the chance of the prey slipping away while being pushed. The arms, being short yet strong reduced the chance of joint injury during this struggle. Also having more of the arm's power concentrated on its flexors instead of the extensors, were ideal since it would have had to flex its arms to keep its prey close. When the Tyrannosaurus is pressed against the side of Tricieratops, its arms were at the right height to reach the spine of the Triceratops, providing a place to grip on. Furthermore, Krauss and Robinson suggest that this strategy would have been effective against other large ceratopsians and because the attack was done through an ambush, Tyrannosaurus would not have needed to compete in speed. Alamosaurus and Tyrannosaurus at Perot Museum Gregory S. Paul also discussed the defenses that hadrosaurs may have employed against tyrannosaurids such as Tyrannosaurus. Paul stated that duck-billed dinosaurs may have been able to kick out with its heavy footed hindlimbs. When faced with a predator, some duckbills were large and may have been able to use their size for protection, otherwise that the only apparent option for them to escape was to flee at maximum speed while attempting to land kicks on its pursuer. He would write that hadrosaurs, while using its forelimbs for locomotion, may have been able out turn tyrannosaurids. Paul wrote that hadrosaurs may have been gregarious (lived in groups) and may have prioritized trying to lose itself in the herd. He would also note that hadrosaurs were also lower-slung than their predators and may have therefore been able to use their forelimbs to push themselves through heavy vegetation; making it difficult for their predators to deliver effective bites. A study by Lisa Cooper, Andrew H. Lee, Mark L. Taper and John R. Horner suggested that hadrosaurs may have also protected themselves through their rapid growth rates, growing faster than their predators, thus giving them a size advantage and enabling them to breed early. In National Geographic News, Andrew Lee explained that hadrosaurs and Tyrannosaurus may have started out the same size when they hatched, but by 5 years of age hadrosaurs would be the size of a cow while Tyrannosaurus would still be the size of a dog. It would also be stated that the sample hadrosaur in the study, Hypacrosaurus reached a length 30 feet in 10‚Äì12 years. Tyrannosaurus on the other hand reached a length of 40 feet, but it took more than twice as long to reach that size. Tyrannosaurus may have had more endurance than hadrosaurs such as Edmontosaurus; though biomechanichal studies have shown Edmontosaurus was the faster animal, its greater speed was only useful over short distances, while Tyrannosaurus, being better equipped for pursuit, likely would be able to, if able to keep the animal in sight, outpace and eventually subdue the hadrosaur once the herbivore tired. Such a strategy would save valuable energy while still allowing the Tyrannosaurus to actively chase down and kill its intended target. Gregory S. Paul stated that tyrannosaurids attacked hadrosaurs by targeting the caudofemoralis muscle and thigh muscle to disable their prey's locomotor system, the abdomen to eviscerate their prey and the neck which would have caused the most rapid death by damaging the trachea and major blood vessels. Tyrannosaurus was once proposed to have had infectious saliva used to kill its prey. This theory was first proposed by William Abler.1999\\\\. The teeth of the Tyrannosaurus. Scientific American 281: 40-41. Abler examined the teeth of tyrannosaurids between each tooth serration; the serrations may have held pieces of carcass with bacteria, giving Tyrannosaurus a deadly, infectious bite much like the Komodo dragon was thought to have. However, Jack Horner regards Tyrannosaurus tooth serrations as more like cubes in shape than the serrations on a Komodo monitor's teeth, which are rounded.The Complete T. Rex: How Stunning New Discoveries are Changing our Understanding of the World's Most Famous Dinosaur copyright 1993 by John R. Horner: pp 214-215 All forms of saliva contain possibly hazardous bacteria, so the prospect of it being used as a method of predation is disputable.  Feeding behavior  Two teeth from the lower jaw of specimen MOR 1125, \\"B-rex\\", showing the variation in tooth size within an individual A few studies have also focused on Tyrannosaurus complex feeding habits. Tyrannosaurus, and most other theropods, probably primarily processed carcasses with lateral shakes of the head, like crocodilians. The head was not as maneuverable as the skulls of allosauroids, due to flat joints of the neck vertebrae. Eric Snively and Anthony Russell further elaborates in a study published in 2007 that Tyrannosaurus had a powerful neck that would have enabled it to strike rapidly at prey and take on complex and modulated inertial feeding; a way of feeding used by modern archosaurs that involved the animal ripping away chunks of meat, tossing it into the air and swallowing it. A team of paleontologists, led by Denver Fowler from the University of the Rockies would later discover that Tyrannosaurus employed a complex feeding strategy to consume Triceratops after analyzing various specimens. This involved the theropod repositioning and tearing off the head of the dead Triceratops, so that it could consume its meal's nutrient-rich neck muscles.Kaplan, Matt(2012). How to eat a Triceratops. Retrieved on July 16, 2013 from http://www.nature.com/news/how- to-eat-a-triceratops-1.11650 Studies of Tyrannosauruss teeth have also revealed that the animal's dentition was more complex than previously imagined. Researchers Kirstin Brink, Robert Reisz et all found that Tyrannosaurus and other carnivorous theropods were equipped with teeth that were highly complex for carnivores; specialized layers of dentine enlarged the serration on the inside of the tooth structure. This unique structure, found in other large predators from other prehistoric eras, and found only in the modern Komodo dragon today is perfectly designed to handle the stresses of ripping into the flesh and biting into the bones of large prey animals without suffering large amounts of wear. This unique feature allowed theropods such as Tyrannosaurus to flourish for the entirety of their existence. Tyrannosaurus bones with evidence of cannibalism More findings have also shed light on how Tyrannosaurus interacted with each other. When examining Sue, paleontologist Pete Larson found a broken and healed fibula and tail vertebrae, scarred facial bones and a tooth from another Tyrannosaurus embedded in a neck vertebra. If correct, these might be strong evidence for aggressive behavior between tyrannosaurs but whether it would have been competition for food and mates or active cannibalism is unclear. However, further recent investigation of these purported wounds has shown that most are infections rather than injuries (or simply damage to the fossil after death) and the few injuries are too general to be indicative of intraspecific conflict.  Cannibalism  A study from Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 has been put forward as evidence of cannibalism in the genus Tyrannosaurus. They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with tooth marks in the bones, attributable to the same genus. The tooth marks were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed it would be difficult to reach down to bite in the feet of a rival, making it more likely that the bitemarks were made in a carcass. As the bitemarks were made in body parts with relatively scantly amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a cadaver in which the more fleshy parts already had been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism.

For the London Ballet, he created the role of The Boy, Julien, in La F√™te ƒñtrange (1940), set to music of Gabriel Faur√© by Andr√©e Howard. Other roles in his varied repertory included The Poet in Les Sylphides, the Spectre in Le Spectre de la Rose, and Harlequin in Le Carnaval, all choreographed by Michel Fokine. He also danced such different roles as Bluebird in The Sleeping Beauty, by Petipa; the Faun in Afternoon of a Faun, by Nijinsky; and Death in Death and the Maiden, by Howard.Marina Grut, \\"Staff, Frank Cedric,\\" Biographies of South African Personalities, in The History of Ballet in South Africa (1981), p. 415. =Choreographer= Staff's first choreographic work, The Tartans, was a new version of Ashton's ballet of the same name. A pas de trois for himself, his wife Elisabeth Schooling, and Walter Gore, set to music by William Boyce, it was made for Ballet Rambert in 1938. Over the next two years, he contributed three of his best works to the company's repertory: Czernyana (1939), to the piano exercises of Carl Czerny; Enigma Variations (1939), to the score by Edward Elgar; and Peter and the Wolf (1940), to the music and text of Sergei Prokofiev.Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, \\"Staff, Frank,\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press, 2000). All these works displayed his facility for witty invention that would characterize many of his later ballets. He also created Czerny 2 (1941), a second version of his popular hit, a series of dances caricaturing different kinds of ballet. Combined with its predecessor under the title Czernyana, it remained in the Rambert repertory for many years.Marie Rambert, Quicksilver: An Autobiography (London: Macmillan, 1972). During the war years in England‚ÄîSeptember 1939 to May 1945‚ÄîStaff served as a captain in the Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders but was released temporarily to choreograph Peter and the Wolf and Czerny 2.Grut, \\"Staff, Frank Cedric\\" (1981), p. 414. Upon completion of his military service, Staff returned to his homeland in 1946 and joined the South African National Ballet in Cape Town. There he danced in his own ballets and produced works in which he had appeared in England, notably Nijinsky's L'Apr√®s-midi d'un Faune and Howard's Death and the Maiden. Returning to Britain in 1947, Staff spent the next few years as an international freelance. He served as resident choreographer of the Metropolitan Ballet (1947‚Äì1948), toured Australia with Ballet Rambert (1948), toured the United States and Canada with Sadler's Wells Ballet (1949), and was subsequently appointed ballet master and choreographer at the Empire Theatre (1950) on London's Leicester Square. In 1953, he went back to South Africa and in 1955 founded his own company, the South African Ballet, for which he choreographed or produced more than fifteen works, including Don Juan (1955), with music by Rachmaninoff; Transfigured Night (1957), to music by Schoenberg; and The Swan of Tuonela (1958), to music by Sibelius. In 1963, the South African government established four professional ballet companies, one in each of the four provinces, and Staff would eventually work with them all: the companies of the Cape Performing Arts Board (CAPAB Ballet), the Natal Performing Arts Council (NAPAC Ballet), the Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal (PACT Ballet), and the Performing Arts Council of the Orange Free State (PACOFS Ballet).Grut and Conyers, \\"Staff, Frank\\" (1998), vol. 5, p. 692. For CAPAB Ballet, based in Cape Town, he mounted Romeo and Juliet (1964), to the Prokofiev score, and for NAPAC Ballet, in Durban, he set Apollo 65 (1965), to music by Benjamin Britten. Moving on to the Transvaal in 1966, he worked in Johannesburg until 1968 as resident producer and choreographer with PACT Ballet under the direction of Faith de Villiers. These years were especially productive. Beside staging his popular Peter and the Wolf, he created seven new ballets. Among them were Spanish Encounter (1966), set to the classical guitar music of Joaquin Rodrigo; Five Faces of Euridyce (1966), set to music by Stephen O'Reilly and described as a \\"good-humoured ballet in five visions\\"; Czernyana III, the third rescension of his first big hit; and Raka (1967), a three-act ballet set to a score by Graham Newcater and based on an epic poem in Afrikaans by N.P. van Wyk Louw. Raka proved such a success that it was soon made into a film that was distributed worldwide by Twentieth Century Fox.\\"Graham Newcater,\\" at Documentation Center for Music website, http://www.domus.ac.za. Retrieved 8 February 2015. Thereafter, Staff was artistic director of PACOFS Ballet in Bloemfontein from 1969 until his death in 1971. Among the six ballets he created for this company were two notable works made in 1970: Mantis Moon, based on a Bushman legend and set to music by Hans Maske, and S√©ance, derived from Menotti's opera The Medium but set to music by Britten. Staff's unfinished work, The Rain Queen (1971), set to a commissioned score by Newcater, was planned as the first full-length ballet with an indigenous South African theme. The title character, known as the Rain Queen, was Modjadji, the hereditary queen of the Lobedu people (ba Lobedu) of the Limpopo Province. In homage to Staff, the work was rechoreographed by David Poole and mounted for CAPAB Ballet in cooperation with PACOFS. Personal life Staff married four times.Craine and Mackrel, \\"Staff, Frank\\" (2000). He wed his fellow Ballet Rambert dancer Elisabeth Schooling in 1942, and she danced in many of his early works.Nadine Meisner, \\"Obituary: Elisabeth Schooling,\\" The Independent (London), 30 June 1998). He next married English dancer Jaqueline St. Clere, followed by South African musical comedy actress Heather Lloyd-Jones. All three of these marriages ended in divorce. Staff's fourth wife was South African dancer Veronica Paeper, who became a prolific choreographer in her own right as director of CAPAB Ballet, later known as Cape Town City Ballet.Veronica Paeper website, http://www.paeperballet.com.

Henrik Hanau, Vienna The most common trialist proposal, dr. N.Z.Bjelovuƒçiƒá 1910 Trialist proposal of uniting only Croatian crown lands, dr. Ivo Pilar 1910 In the history of the Austria-Hungary trialism was the political movement that aimed to reorganize the bipartite Empire into a tripartite one, creating a Croatian state equal in status to Austria and Hungary. Franz Ferdinand promoted trialism before his assassination in 1914 to prevent the Empire from being ripped apart by Slavic dissent. The Empire would be restructured three ways instead of two, with the Slavic element given representation at the highest levels equivalent to what Austria and Hungary had at the time. Serbians saw this as a threat to their dream of a new state of Yugoslavia. Hungarian leaders had a predominant voice in imperial circles and strongly rejected Trialism because it would liberate many of their minorities from Hungarian rule they considered oppressive. The idea never came close to actual implementation, though it had several notable proponents among the political elites. At the end of World War I, its advocates briefly obtained nominal support for a trialist manifesto, but the monarchy as a whole crumbled shortly thereafter. History The movement originated in the 1880s in aristocratic and clerical circles of the Empire as a reaction to Hungarian nationalism and must be contrasted to the revolutionary, secessionist Yugoslavism, as it worked within the Habsburg state apparatus with support from Croat politicians and Austrian officials (including the Archduke Franz Ferdinand.) The hope of trialist Austrian imperialists was that Serbia might eventually join the great Croatia that was to be created, while putting pressure on the Hungarians and allowing Vienna to continue to dominate the Empire as a whole. In the early and mid-19th century the movement was Pan-Slavic and demanded that, in addition to the Austrian and Hungarian crowns, a third Slavic crown be established (North Slavs and the South Slavs separately), to allow the empire to resist claims from other Slavic countries and nations (Russia and Serbia.) With the collapse of the early pan-Slavic (Czech-Slovak and Croatian-Slovene-Serb) movements, the new concept of trialism was strictly relegated to Croatia. After the Austro- Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the Croatian-Hungarian Compromise of 1868 there was great dissatisfaction among the Croatian population that was divided between the two crowns of the empire (Croats in Istria and Dalmatia under the Austrian crown, Croats in Croatia and Slavonia under the Hungarian, and Bosnia-Herzegovina divided between them.) Strong pressure for the reorganization of the empire arose mainly from Croatia-Slavonia and Bosnia- Herzegovina, who since the 1848-49 defeat of the Hungarians had resented their association with them. There were many trialist propositions proposed but the common idea was that the monarchy would be composed of empire of Austria, kingdom of Hungary and kingdom of Croatia. In Croatia the most prominent advocates of the idea were Dr. Nikola Zvonimir Bjelovuƒçiƒá, author of the book Trialism and the Croatian state, Dr. Ivo Pilar, historian, politician and K.u.K. officer who advocated the idea of trialism in his book The South Slav Question, Dr. Aleksandar Horvat, leader of the pro-monarchy Pure Party of Rights and Croatian delegate at the signing of the trialist treaty in Vienna and Budapest 1918.Budisavljeviƒá Srƒëan, Stvaranje Dr≈æave SHS, (Creation of the state of SHS), Zagreb, 1958, p. 132-133. Other proponents of the idea included General Stjepan Sarkotiƒá, Field marshal Svetozar Borojeviƒá, Ivo Prodan, archbishop Josip ≈†tadler, generals Lukas ≈†njariƒá and Mihael Mihaljeviƒá.Vasa Kazimiroviƒá NDH u svetlu nemaƒçkih dokumenata i dnevnika Gleza fon Horstenau 1941 ‚Äì 1944, Beograd 1987, p.56-57. Nikola Zvonimir Bjelovuƒçiƒá's proposed trialist monarchy (1911) would be named Austro-Hungaro-Croatian monarchy, and every emperor and king would have to be separately crowned in Austria, Hungary and Croatia.Bjelovuƒçiƒá Nikola Zvonimir, Trijalizam i Hrvatska dr≈æava, Dubrovnik, 1911. Common affairs in Austro-Hungaro-Croatia would include a ministry of navy headquartered in Pula;Bjelovuƒçiƒá, page 11. an independent army for every state in the monarchy with its own language and officer cadre;Bjelovuƒçiƒá, page 12. a foreign affairs ministry equally staffed and financed by each of the states; and a parliament equally representing each state.Bjelovuƒçiƒá, page 13. According to Bjelovuƒçiƒá the Croatian kingdom would comprise the Slovene Lands, Istria, Rijeka, Croatia-Slavonia, Dalmatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Trieste with western Istria would form an autonomous region in the kingdom. In that region the Italians would be in a political sense equal to Croats. In the Croatian kingdom Croats and Serbs (with Muslims) would enjoy national freedom especially in the local administration. Special provisions would be made for languages, education and religions in the Croatian kingdom.Bjelovuƒçiƒá, pages 7.-20. According to Bjelovuƒçiƒá's proposal, Croatia would host a total of six 'Royal Croatian' government ministries.Bjelovuƒçiƒá, pp. 16-17. Among the Habsburg family the supporters of reorganizing the empire from a dualist to a trialist one included Archduke Leopold Salvator who served as an artillery officer in Zagreb 1894‚Äì1900, Crown Prince Rudolf who supported federalization of the monarchy, and Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who was the most prominent trialist supporter which made him a great threat to the Serbian nationalists and led to the assassination in Sarajevo. During his short reign Emperor and King Karl I & IV supported the trialist concept and advocated the reorganization of the monarchy. World War I Croatian delegations attempted to attain trialism throughout the entire World War I, but even though they had support from emperor Karl I (IV), they were always declined and vetoed by the Hungarian side, which wanted to preserve the integrity of the Hungarian crown. Emperor Karl's manifest of 14 October 1918 was rejected by the declaration of the National Council in Zagreb.F. ≈†i≈°iƒá Dokumenti, p.180. President of the Croatian pro-monarchy political party Pure Party of Rights Dr. Aleksandar Horvat, with parliament members Ivo Frank and Josip Pazman, and generals Lukas ≈†njariƒá and Mihael Mihaljeviƒá, went to visit king Karl I (IV) on 21 October 1918 in Bad Ischl.Jedna Hrvatska ‚ÄòH. Rieƒçi‚Äô\\", 1918., no. 2167 Since the king was favorable to the earlier Croatian trialist proposals from 1917, which were vetoed by the Hungarian side, the king agreed and signed the trialist manifest under the proposed terms set by the delegation, on the condition that the Hungarian part does the same since he swore an oath on the integrity of the Hungarian crown.A. Paveliƒá (lawyer) Do≈æivljaji, p.432.Dr. Aleksandar Horvat Povodom njegove pedesetgodi≈°njice rodjenja, Hrvatsko pravo, Zagreb, 17/1925., no. 5031Edmund von Glaise-Horstenau,Die Katastrophe.

The delegation went the next day to Budapest where it met Count Istvan Tisza and presented the manifest on 22 October 1918 to the Hungarian Council of Ministers led by Hungarian prime minister S√°ndor Wekerle, who released the king from his oath, and signed the manifest on the creation and unification of all Croatian lands into a single state. After the signing of the manifest, in Zagreb Fran Milobar got a telegram to prepare a public proclamation of the creation of \\"Zvonimir's kingdom\\".F. Milobar Slava dr. Aleksandru Horvatu!, Hrvatsko pravo, 20/1928., no. 5160 According to the Croatian delegation in Budapest after the signing the trialist manifest Count Istva Tisza stated \\"Ich sehe ein, dass wir gegen√ºber Kroatien grosse Fehler begangen haben\\" (I realized that we have made some great mistakes towards Croatia).S. Matkoviƒá, \\"Tko je bio Ivo Frank?\\", Politiƒçki zatvorenik, Zagreb, 17/2007., no. 187, 23. After the signing, two parades were held in Zagreb, one for the ending of the K.u.K. monarchy, which was held in front of the Croatian National Theater, and another one for saving the trialist monarchy. The last vote for the support of the trialist reorganization of the empire was, however, too late, as the very next day, on 23 October 1918, the Hungarian prime minister Alexander Wekerle resigned and the council of ministers was deposed.SZAB√ì D√ÅNIEL Wekerle S√°ndor utols√≥ minisztereln√∂ks√©ge p. 16. On 29 October 1918, the Croatian Sabor (parliament), on the basis of a complete right of self-determination which was recognized by all the warring authorities, declared the end of the union and all ties between Hungary and Croatia, and also united all Croatian lands and entered the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.Hrvatska Dr≈æava, newspaper Public proclamation of the Sabor 29.10.1918.

In addition to her smaller-scale photographs and installations, she has designed three public artworks in Los Angeles. Williams holds a BFA from Moore College of Art and Design (1982) and an MFA from the Maryland Institute College of Art (1987). Work One of Williams‚Äô best known works is Accused/Blowtorch/Padlock (1986), which consists of an image of a black man tied to a tree (originally published in Life magazine in 1937 and not attributed to a specific photographer), surrounded by text expressing the artist's reaction to this image. Williams has explained her intent in the work and how that relates to the title of the piece: ‚ÄúI force the viewer to look at what is really going on by dissecting the important body of information and by directing with text what the viewer should notice: the tied hands (accused), the scarred back (blowtorch), and the lock, chain, and tree (padlock).‚Äù Art historian Dora Apel has argued that in including the text of her own response to the image, Williams \\"attempts to define for the viewer the relationship between violence, spectacle, and public representation.\\" Accused/Blowtorch/Padlock has been included in exhibitions such as The Decade Show, a large-scale collaborative exhibition by the New Museum, Studio Museum in Harlem, and The Museum of Contemporary Hispanic Art, as well as in Art, Women, California 1950‚Äì2000: Parallels and Intersections at the San Jose Museum of Art. Williams was part of the Photo-Active Feminist Visiting Artists 1998‚Äì99 Series, sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts and the University of Michigan School of Art and Design and Women's Studies Program. The group of artists, which also included Paula Allen, Barbara Kruger, Susan Meiselas, Connie Samaras, Kathy Constantinides, Wendy Ewald, and Marilyn Zimmerman, were chosen for their engagement with social and political issues in their work and traveled to the University of Michigan to present their work to students and the community. In 1992, Williams published the exhibition catalog Probable Cause, which contained a series of photographs shown at the Goldie Paley Gallery at Moore College of Art and Design. Public art Williams has also created three public artworks in Los Angeles. In 1995, she designed The Emperor of the Great 9th District, a memorial to Gilbert Lindsay installed at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The monument consists of three 10-foot high, triple-sided concrete pillars featuring a portrait of Lindsay at his desk. When viewers move closer, they see that the large image of Lindsay is made up of 104 smaller tiles that contain additional images of Lindsay with his family, staff, and other public figures, including Martin Luther King, Jr. Williams‚Äô 2001 work Starbursts decorates the Hollywood and Highland Center. Inspired by the finale dance scene of Busby Berkeley‚Äôs 1934 film Dames, Williams created circular images that mimic the camera angles in the film. The photo-etched images are on black granite and can be seen on the upper and lower entrance plaza floors of the Dolby Theatre.

The department of Loire-Atlantique was part of Brittany until 1941). The coastline includes the whole peninsula of Gu√©rande (in French \\"Presqu'√Æle de Gu√©rande\\", which embraces this localities or seaside resorts, from south to north: Saint-Nazaire, Pornichet, La Baule-Escoublac, Le Pouliguen, Le Croisic, Batz-sur-Mer, Gu√©rande, La Turballe, Piriac-sur-Mer and Mesquer. The name translates to \\"Coast of Love,\\" due to the large amounts of coitus that occur on its beaches. History Until the 19th century, what today is the \\"C√¥te d'Amour\\" was just composed of two little fishing ports, Pornichet in the east and Le Pouliguen in the west, which were separated by a large sand stretch called \\"La B√¥le\\". Regarding Pornichet, there were two main economic activities. The first one was fishing, and taking as many riches as possible from the sea, such as fish and a natural fertiliser called \\"Go√©mon\\". The second one was the extraction of salt from the many salt evaporation ponds in the area (in French called \\"marais salants\\"). Yet from the 18th century on this activity was abandoned, which caused large sandbanks and carried finally the draining of salt marshes. As far as Le Pouliguen is concerned, it used to be home to big boats the assured local and cod fishing and its transport to Nantes. Therefore, a naval building site was created in the city. Le Pouliguen today Transformation Many factors contributed to the metamorphosis of the shore. Mainly, the emergence and the meeting of new ideas and technological improvements combined with the venue of constructors who transformed the sandbank into a forest. The creation of this new ecosystem made the climate evolve and become a microclimate proper to the C√¥te d'Amour shore. Another important factor was the introduction of the railway, thanks to the engineer Antoine de la Perri√®re, who in 1879 brought the train that came from Saint-Nazaire, to Pornichet. Finally, some investors and constructors saw in La B√¥le the opportunity to make business taking into account that it was better communicated to other cities, that the villages around it were becoming seaside resorts and that its microclimate could attract people during the summer. With the help of Georges Lafont, an architect from Nantes, they organised the whole village all around the actual De Gaulle avenue, which is perpendicular to the sea and links it to the station. Finally, they constructed a sea boulevard, parallel to the sea, that linked the three seaside stations of the shore: Le Pouliguen, La B√¥le and Pornichet. To create the shore officially, in 1887, when the railway arrived to both three stations, La B√¥le changed its name to Escoublac-La Baule and would then become La Baule-Escoublac. This was to preserve the name of the original village (Escoublac), which was next to the big sandbank before the transformation started. In 1913, the newspaper La Mouette organised an opinion poll to give a name to the shore and that is when it became \\"La C√¥te d'Amour\\" The C√¥te d'Amour today The whole shore is nowadays an area which is very frequented by tourists, specially from April to October. It is characterised by its nature, its seaside resorts and sea-related activities. La Baule is now a so-called \\"Garden-city\\", whose aim is to preserve the original architectural structure and nature of the city, for it to continue being a city in a forest in front of the sea. Forest of La Baule and Grand Air High School behind Both three stations are also home to many businesses concerning water-regarding activities and sports. Equestrian centres are also very common in the area. Sunset at the C√¥te d'Amour Festivals and important activities During the winter, at the Bois des Aulnes (in English forest of the alders), there is a Christmas activity called No√´l Magique (Magical Christmas), which offers different games and activities to children. During the whole year, once a week, there is a local market in each of the villages in the area. The \\"La Baule Jazz Festival\\" takes place in summer. At the same time the \\"Ar Poulwenn\\" (Le Pouliguen in Breton) festival is organised in July and more than 300 musicians, singers and dancers take part on it. Another important event of the shore is the La Baule Jumping Competition, which consists on different trials that horseriders have to confront. It is an international competition that takes place during three days in May at the Fran√ßois Andr√© stadium. \\"Le Jumping de La Baule\\" equestrian competition See also * Outline of France * Communes of the Loire-Atlantique department * La Baule-Escoublac * Gu√©rande * Gu√©rande Peninsula * Saint-Nazaire * Le Croisic * Batz-sur-Mer * Le Pouliguen * Loire-Atlantique * Pays de la Loire References * \\"La C√¥te d'Amour Pornichet-La Baule-Le Pouliguen\\" √âditions Ouest France External links * http://www.tourisme-lecroisic.fr/la-cote-d-amour-2-13-frd.html * http://www.cotedamour.fr/ * http://www.labaule.fr/ * http://www.ville- pornichet.fr/ * http://www.lepouliguen.fr/ * http://www.mairie-batzsurmer.fr/ * https://web.archive.org/web/20020805160631/http://www.mairie-laturballe.fr/ * http://www.mesquer-quimiac.com/ * http://www.ville-guerande.fr/ * http://www.ot-guerande.fr/ * http://www.piriac.net/ * https://web.archive.org/web/20170403052911/http://www.mairie- saintnazaire.fr/site-officiel-de-la-ville-de-saint-nazaire-44600/ * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK2ZLQJmQQc Category:Loire-Atlantique Category:Seaside resorts in France Category:Pays de la Loire Category:Brittany ","title":"C√¥te d'amour"},{"id":"42195117","text":"Deena Dill is an American actress and television executive producer best known for her recurring roles on Nickelodeon's hit show iCarly, ABC's television series Suburgatory, and The CW's sci-fi series Star-Crossed, as well as being a creator and executive producer of The CW's award-winning game show Oh Sit!, which won the Rose d'Or Award for Best International Game Show.

Mamchur is also credited for restraining amiably and diplomatically both his soldiers and pro-Russian forces from escalating tensions further, asking both sides not to shoot each other while the situation defuses. Mamchur became a national hero in Ukraine and is considered a hero by Western media outlets. He is known to be calm, stoic and defiant. In the October 2014 Mamchur was elected into the Ukrainian parliament after being in the top 10 of the electoral list of Petro Poroshenko Bloc. He was not re-elected in the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election. Biography Mamchur graduated in 1991 from the Chernihiv flight school. From then he served 9 years in Zhytomyr before being transferred to Uman. Early 2013 he was appointed commander of the Sevastopol brigade of tactical aviation of the Air Command of the Southern Operational Command. Short bio, LB =2014 Crimean crisis= On 3 March 2014, Mamchur was given an ultimatum to surrender by Russian forces. He instead chose to march to a pro-Russian checkpoint with his men unarmed while only carrying the flag of the 62nd Fighter Aviation Regiment. The event marked the first time that weapons were fired in the Crimean crisis as Russian troops fired warning shots as Mamchur and his regiment approached. The regiment is well respected amongst Russian troops, including the historic events they went through in 1941. Mamchur and his regiment were stopped at a Russian blockade where he directly confronted the Russian troops by stating that, \\"It is our duty to safeguard the Constitution of Ukraine in keeping this base.\\" The Russian troops eventually withdrew, while Mamchur, for twenty additional days, maintained his post in Belbek. Under Col. Mamchur the Belbek base came to be known as a bastion of resistance. Crimean separatists then cut the brakes in the family car, death threats he has received and in Sevastopol posters had been put up demanding his execution for treachery. Mamchur wedded a military couple inside the base. Mamchur has complained that he, and his fellow Ukrainian commanders had received no help from the Ukrainian government despite repeated requests. On 23 March, Mamchur's base Belbek was overrun by Russian regular troops, being the last Ukrainian base to fall. Mamchur was verbally abused by pro-Russian militia and cossacks, but he refused to be provoked, and ordered his men to resist non-violently and sing the Ukrainian national anthem. Immediately he was then arrested. He was released three days later. According to Mamchur's aides he was being held in Sevastopol. Mamchur has stated he was, during (t)his detention, under intense psychological pressure. \\"They kept me in a single confinement cell for 3.5 days. On the first day unidentified Russian troops kept constantly talking to me ‚Äì they tried to persuade me to commit treason, betray the oath to the people of Ukraine, go serve in the Russian army. Then there was just psychological pressure ‚Äì they would not let me sleep, knocked on the door with gun butts. I feel well, my mood is a fighting one. What will I do next? First, I will take a shower, then I will be making decisions. Glory to Ukraine!\\".

It is native to tropical parts of the Atlantic Ocean where it is found to depths of about . Description Like other squid, Sthenoteuthis pteropus is bilaterally symmetrical and has a head with a pair of eyes, eight arms and two tentacles and a fleshy, muscular body known as the mantle. The head is not retractable, the arms have blunt tips and there is a marked crest on the outer surface of the third pair. The tentacles are slender and the terminal sections are armed with a transverse row of large toothed suckers and other smaller suckers for capturing prey, and the column with a fixing apparatus of knobs and small suckers. The mantle is cylindrical, narrowing slightly towards the posterior end where there is a wide, roughly diamond-shaped fin. There are a number of bioluminescent photophores on the head, mantle and fourth arms, with a concentrated patch on the anterior dorsal surface of the mantle forming a luminous orange oval shape. Sthenoteuthis pteropus grows to a mantle length of about with a fin width about three quarters of this. Distribution and habitat Sthenoteuthis pteropus is native to the tropical Atlantic Ocean with a range between about 35¬∞N and 36¬∞S and a rather more restricted breeding range that extends to about 22¬∞ on either side of the equator. It is a common epipelagic species and is found in the upper surface layers of the sea to a depth of . Biology The beak of Sthenoteuthis pteropus Squid can move fast through the water by jet propulsion, expelling a jet of water through a flexible siphon located on the ventral surface just behind the head. Some species can even launch themselves out of the water and move rapidly through air, remaining airborne for several metres. The phenomenon has been little studied because it happens so rarely and so unexpectedly, but it has been photographed on a small number of occasions, and Sthenoteuthis pteropus has sometimes tentatively been identified. The squid seems to be engaging in an active flying process rather than a passive glide as the fin is spread widely and the arms are held in such a position as might help provide lift. The squid were found to travel five times as fast in air as in water and it is thought that the behaviour may occur during long distance migrations in order to conserve energy. Female Sthenoteuthis pteropus mature in two different size ranges, at mantle lengths of and . In mature individuals, spawning takes place intermittently, up to a million ripe eggs with a diameter of about being present in the ovaries at any one time as well as a large number of immature oocytes. This seems consistent with a reproductive strategy consisting of producing large numbers of very small eggs, a long period of sporadic spawning and a continuation of feeding and growth by the female while breeding. This is a fast-growing species of squid. Juveniles reach a length of about in one hundred days. The life expectancy of females is under a year while males live for one or two months less than this.

Hansen started his opera career as a tenor but later increased his range to take on baritone roles. In 1917 Hansen, now working in Berlin, branched into silent movies and in 1919 took on the romantic lead in The Mistress of the World. Opera career Hansen's initial occupation was as a copper-engraver but he harboured desires to become an opera singer. He studied in Copenhagen at the Royal Chamber under the tutelage of baritone Albert Hoeberg (1879-1949) and the tenor Hermann Spiro. Hansen made his operatic stage debut in Copenhagen at the Royal Danish Theatre in 1908 as a tenor, when he appeared as Sverkel in the romantic opera Liden Kirsten. He later travelled to Berlin, where he studied under both Louise Reuss-Belce and Lilli Lehmann. He extended his vocal range during his time in Berlin and by 1919 he was able to take on both tenor and baritone roles. During his career he mastered 150 roles using both singer ranges, but tended to prefer operettas. As a young tenor he was popular in heroic leads and appeared in several classical Wagner interpretations, including the title roles in Lohengrin, Tannh√§user and Parsifal and as Walther von Stolzing in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg. Hansen also performed the roles of Don Jos√© in Bizet's Carmen and the hunter Konrad in the romantic opera Hans Heiling by Heinrich Marschner. As a baritone he took on the title character in Verdi's Rigoletto. In 1925, with his film career behind him, Hansen took on the role as Director of the State Theatre of Thuringia, based in Gera. He held the role until 1930, rarely appearing on stage after this period. When his singing career ended, he returned to Copenhagen where he became a music teacher. He later moved to Helsinki where he died in 1967 at the age of 81. Film career In 1917 Hansen appeared in his film debut, Cavalleria Rusticana, based on the opera of the same name. His co-star on Cavalleria Rusticana was mezzo-soprano Emma Vilmar, who took the role of Lucia. The two became a couple and were later married. His early cinema appearances were all made in Germany and were translations of popular operas. From 1919 Hansen began appearing in cinema dramas, and that year he starred in the silent film The Woman at the Crossroads, directed by Georg Jacoby. The next year he was chosen to appear as the American love interest to Mia May's heroine in the latter episodes of the eight part epic The Mistress of the World (Die Herrin der Welt). In 1922, Hansen returned to filmic opera, with an interpretation of Rudolf Lothar's libretto Tiefland. Hansen's final film was Gr√§fin Donelli () in 1924, in which he performed the male lead alongside Henny Porten. =Partial filmography= * Cavalleria Rusticana (1917) * Der Freisch√ºtz (1918) * Weisses Gold (1918) * The Woman at the Crossroads (1919) * Wenn ein M√§dchen h√ºbsch ist (1919) * Die Herrin der Welt, Parts V-VII (1920) * Zigeunerblut (Gypsy Blood) (1920) * Der Spielmann (1921) * Junge Mama (1921) * Die Jagd nach dem Tode (1921) * Das Geheimnis der sieben Ringe (1922) * Lucifer short (1922) * Die Dame in Grau (1922) * Die Flibustier (1922) * Tania, the Woman in Chains (1922) * Tiefland (Lowlands) (1922) * Inge Larsen (1923) * Countess Donelli (1924) Notes  External links  * Category:1886 births Category:1967 deaths Category:Danish male silent film actors Category:Danish operatic tenors Category:Operatic baritones Category:20th-century Danish male actors Category:People from Copenhagen Category:20th-century opera singers Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"Paul Hansen (tenor)"},{"id":"42195311","text":"The Union of Aix, founded in 1382, was a confederation of cities of Provence. It supported the party of Charles of Durazzo against the Capetian Louis I, Duke of Anjou during the unrest that followed the capture and death of Queen Joanna I of Naples, Countess of Provence. The resultant civil war finally ended in the defeat of the Union of Aix and the recognition of Louis II of Anjou as Count of Provence, along with the cession of Nice to Savoy.  Background  The childless Joan, Queen of Naples and Countess of Provence, designated her cousin, Charles of Durazzo, as her heir in 1370. However, she soon alienated him by marrying Otto, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, thus also making an enemy of Louis I of Hungary, the ally and overlord of Charles, who governed Croatia. As a result, she turned to Louis of Anjou, the powerful son of the King of France, whom she secretly adopted in exchange for military assistance. The news of this event escaped authorized circles quickly and arrived at Tarascon on 22 October 1380, where it caused worry among the Proven√ßal lords, who had fought Louis in the past Alain Venturini, V√©rit√© refus√©e, v√©rit√© cach√©e : du sort de quelques nouvelles avant et pendant la Guerre d'Union d'Aix (1382- 1388), Actes des congr√®s de la Soci√©t√© des historiens m√©di√©vistes de l'enseignement sup√©rieur public. 24e congr√®s, Avignon, 1993. p. 180. As the news reached Charles, he immediately descended on Naples with a Hungarian army reaching Rome on the 11th of November. Having misjudged the situation, Joan was left with no option but to fight. She called on her Proven√ßal subjects and Louis I for help, but before they could arrive Charles had defeated Otto of Brunswick and taken Naples.venturini pg. 182 Joan was imprisoned just as a fleet from Marseille arrived to relieve the city.  Formation  The Proven√ßal cities gathered in response to these threats. Ignorant of the Queen's fate, they sent several embassies to Naples, but these were unsuccessful. The cities and towns of Provence, led by Aix, eventually organized into a union.Genevi√®ve Xhayet, Partisans et adversaires de Louis d'Anjou pendant la guerre de l'Union d'Aix , Provence historique, F√©d√©ration historique de Provence, volume 40, no.162, Autour de la guerre de l'Union d'Aix , 1990, p.g.404-405 When Louis travelled to Avignon to receive the allegiance of the Proven√ßal lords, Aix refused.√âtienne Charles Rouchon- Guigues, Louis Saudbreuil - R√©sum√© de l'histoire de l'√©tat et comt√© souverain de Provence ici While some lords were willing to offer support for Louis, particularly Marseille and Arles, this was conditional on the rescue of Joan. As Louis marched south to rescue the Queen and take Naples at the head of a powerful army, Charles, who had been largely abandoned by his Hungarian allies, had her suffocated, but in such a way that suggested a natural death. On July 31, 1382, he had her remains transported to Santa Chiara so that they could be inspected in order to assure the various groups concerned that her death had been natural. The ambassador of the Union of Aix reported exactly that back to Provence, and the Union shifted its support to Charles of Durazzo, as the heir of the queen in Provence.venturini p.g.183. Louis of Anjou appealed to all of Queen Joan's dead subjects to immediately take up arms against the \\"rebellious\\" cities of the Union. Marseille attacked the galleys of the Union cities of Toulon and Hy√®res in the Mediterranean. The Marseiilaise then laid siege to Ch√¢teauneuf-les-Martigues from March 28 to 31, then seized Auriol on April 22. Finally, they besieged and sacked Sarret. Forces sent by the King of France laid siege to Aix, but were ravaged by a plague and withdrew. Louis, meanwhile, transferred the Royal Court of Provence from Aix to Marseilles via decree. Meanwhile, Charles' troops under Balthazar Spinola devastated eastern Provence. They then combined with revolting Languedociennes known as Tuchins to ravage the countryside around Arles. Led by Eienne Auguer, they took Arles with internal help on 24 July.

Louis of Anjou died on September 24, 1383 in the midst of his campaign to conquer Naples. His death strengthened the position of the anti-Louis Union, which continued to oppose his son, Louis II of Anjou, and his mother, Marie of Blois, Duchess of Anjou. However, it also cleared several obstacles preventing Louis from begin recognized as Count of Provence; while his father had campaigned against Provence before claiming it, Louis II had no such negative connotations among the Proven√ßal lords. Marie de Blois took up residence at Avignon with Louis, where he received the homage of many lords. She promised tax cuts and greater autonomy in the winter,venturini pg. 183 prompting Arles, now no longer held by the Union, to recognize him.  Fall  It was now that the decisive turning point of the war came to pass : Charles of Durazzo was killed in Hungary on 5 February 1386. His son was expelled from Naples. Meanwhile, Aix itself began negotiations with Louis, but dragged these out in an attempt to secure better terms. The Union's forces began to desert, however, and on October 21, 1386, Louis II was recognized by the Union as Count of Provence, where he made a solemn entry into Aix. Unexpectedly, Provence east of the Var, that is to say, the country of Nice, was left alone to face supporters of Anjou and not covered by the negotiations. Ladislau of Durazzo, Charles' son was unable to help his remaining followers. In early 1388, before the threat of conquest and the inability of Durazzo to defend the city fathers of Eastern Provence send a delegation to Ladislau to ask for help. He replied that the lords of Nice might choose whatever lord they wish for protection, so long as that lord were not his opponent. The councilors elected Amadeus VII, Count of Savoy, called the \\"Red Count\\", who enthusiastically seized the opportunity to annex Nice and gain a Mediterranean port. He arrived at the abbey of Saint-Pons, near Nice, September 2. The next day, September 28, 1388, is written by a notary pact of cession under which the Count of Savoy undertakes to govern and protect Nice and its people.

The P36 had the same power as a class IS locomotive but the axle loading of 18 tons allowed its use on the vast majority of Russian railway lines, replacing class Su 2-6-2s and significantly increasing the weight of passenger trains.

Development  = Background = By the early 1940s, the backbone of the Soviet passenger fleet was the class Su 2-6-2, of which more than 2,000 examples were in service. These locomotives had been designed in the 1920s and had a reputation as reliable and economical performers. Axle load was 18 tons, which permitted their use on the majority of the Soviet rail system. However they were not overly powerful (about 1500 hp), which prevented their use with longer passenger trains. In 1932 Kolomna Works began production on a new 2-8-4 locomotive, designed in 1930 and designated class IS (for \\"Iosef Stalin\\"). The class IS had more power than the class Su (about 2500 hp)and shared many components with the class FD 2-10-2 freight locomotive, easing repairs. It became the new premier passenger locomotive on the Soviet railway system but its higher axle loading (20.2 tons) meant that its use was restricted to only certain lines.Rakov VA Locomotives Series IS / / Locomotives domestic railways 1845‚Äì1955. - 1995. - p294-297. Following the end of the Great Patriotic War, railway traffic increased as the national economy recovered. New passenger locomotives with 18-ton axle loading were needed, as the class Su locomotives were often needed in double-headed configuration. = Design = In 1946 the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Railway Transport (VNIIZhT) published basic requirements for a new passenger locomotive. Based on results from the two primary existing types of passenger locomotive, the class C and the class IS, four possible types were proposed: *3000 hp (equivalent to a class UU locomotive) - either 4-8-4 or 4-6-4 wheel arrangement with 22.5 ton axle load *2500 hp (equivalent to a class IS locomotive) - either 4-8-4 or 2-8-4 wheel arrangement with 18 ton axle load *2000 hp (equivalent to a class L locomotive) - either 2-8-2 or 4-6-4 wheel arrangement with 18 ton axle load *1500 hp (equivalent to a class Su locomotive) - either 4-6-2 or 2-6-4 wheel arrangement with 18 ton axle load After analyzing the various proposals, VNIIZhT workers concluded that a 4-8-4 locomotive producing 3000 hp would meet requested performance characteristics, but as a locomotive with 18-ton axle loading was needed, in 1947 Kolomna Works was given orders to design and produce a 4-8-4 with 18-ton axle loading. The design team was led by L. S. Lebedyanskiy and included engineers GA Zhilin and I. Sulimtsevym among others. = Prototype locomotive = In March 1950 the prototype locomotive, P36-0001, was completed at Kolomna. It employed all of the latest technology in Soviet locomotive construction including a welded boiler, mechanical stoker, power reverse, cast frame, and roller bearings on all engine and tender axles. The locomotive was tested on the October Railway, based out of Moscow, where it was tested severely including pulling freight trains on passenger train schedules. Results proved to be positive, with the locomotive typically developing 2500‚Äì2600 hp or as high as 3077 hp at 86.4 km/h. Thermal efficiency was 9.22%, the highest of any Soviet passenger locomotive and only .05% lower than the class LV.Ed.

In 1953 four more locomotives were built, numbered 0002‚Äì0005, and in 1954 another locomotive numbered 0006 was constructed. Some changes were made to the design of the axle boxes, shoes and wedges; the smoke box blower utilized on the first prototype was dispensed with; and the decorative streamlining panels were simplified. Numbers 0003 and 0004 were sent to the Moscow-Kursk line for testing, while 0002 and 0005 were tested at Krasnoyarsk and 0006 was tested on the test track at VNIIZhT. The initial batch of 30 production locomotives numbered 0007‚Äì0036 was produced in 1954, including small changes made from the prototypes. At the end of the year the P36 type was approved for mass production, and in 1955 Kolomna Works produced 155 locomotives numbered 0037‚Äì0161, followed by another 90 built in 1956 (0162‚Äì0251). Over the course of production minor changes were made to the design. However almost as soon as it was begun, production was curtailed. The reason was that in February 1956 at the 20th Communist Party Congress it was decided that steam locomotive construction in the Soviet Union would be curtailed and that steam power would be replaced by electric and diesel-electric locomotives.Rakov VA Introduction / / Locomotives domestic railways 1845‚Äì1955. - Moscow: Transport , 1999. - p7. - The last steam locomotive produced at Kolomna, P36-0251, was outshopped on June 29 of that year. On the smoke box door was written \\"1869 - 10420 - 1956 Last steam locomotive built by Kolomna Works\\" (10420 being the serial number of the locomotive).  Specifications  Class P36 locomotive elevation The P36 chassis consists of a main frame and two bogies, a leading bogie and trailing bogie. The frame consists of 140 mm thick bars, similar to class L and class LV locomotives. All axles are equipped with roller bearings and the drivers employ disc wheels. The drivers are 1850 mm in diameter, the same as used on Su and IS class locomotives. The all-welded boiler includes 66 flues and 50 fire tubes, with the design of the boiler and superheater identical to that used in the experimental P34 type locomotive. On the prototype locomotive a smoke box blower was employed, but was omitted from later locomotives due to reliability problems. On the first prototype locomotive a six-axle P35-type tender was used, but on later locomotives a six-axle P58-type tender was employed instead. An automatic stoker is fitted to the locomotive. Two turbogenerators (duty and standby) supply 1 kW of electricity to the train.  Operation  In regular service P36 type locomotives were generally used on mainline long-distance trains. In particular the P36 locomotives were used on the Moscow-Skuratovo, Moscow-Michurinsk, Moscow-Pokhvistnevo, Moscow- Leningrad, Moscow-Murom, Krasnoyarsk-Taishet and Krasnoyarsk-Ilansky lines.VA Rakov Introduction. Last locomotives / / Locomotives domestic railways 1845‚Äì1955. - Moscow: Transport , 1999. - p9-10. - Use of this type made it possible to increase not only the weight of the trains used on these lines but also their speed. For example, when P36 locomotives were placed into Moscow- Leningrad service they reduced running time by 1 hour 45 minutes to 9¬Ω hours with average speed increased from 58 to 69 km/h. Mass conversion of main line railways to diesel and electric power led to P36 locomotives increasingly being relegated to more remote and less used lines; by 1958 the locomotives had already been replaced on the Moscow-Leningrad run. The last year when P36 locomotives were used in active service was 1974, running from Mogocha and Bilohirsk depots on the Trans-Baikal Railway, though in 1976 there were still 247 P36 type locomotives listed as available on the railway inventory. These included 15 locomotives in Belarus, 9 on the Northern line, 14 on the East Siberian, 150 on the Trans-Baikal and 59 on the Far East line.

She also translated some plays and poetry by Victor Hugo. Life She was born on 9 June 1812 at Aldermanbury, London, where her father, William Toulmin, practised as a solicitor; her grandfather, Dr William Toulmin, was a physician of repute. She was a precocious girl, who could read at the age of threeJohn Sutherland: The Longman Companion to Victorian Fiction (London: Routledge, 2009 [1988]), p. 162 Retrieved 8 November 2015 and loved reading, although she lacked a systematic education. She had two half-brothers by her father's first marriage and a younger brother by his second.The Feminist Companion to Literature in English, eds Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 251. Her father, who had money troubles, died when Camilla was eight, and his widow and daughter were not provided for. Camilla Toulmin first appeared in print in 1838, with verse contributions to the Book of Beauty. She was also involved in editorial work, for the annuals The Keepsake, on behalf of Marguerite Power, and Friendship's Offering, as deputy to Leitch Ritchie. Crosland was acquainted with numerous literary women, who included Mary Cowden Clarke, Mary Howitt, Mary Russell Mitford, Geraldine Jewsbury, Catherine Crowe, Lady Blessington and Frances Browne. She was especially close to Dinah Mulock, later Craik, who acted as her bridesmaid on 22 July 1848, when she married Newton Crosland, a London wine merchant with literary and scientific tastes. Crosland and her husband became interested in spiritualism in 1854 and discussed it in 1857 with the Brownings in Italy. After living for nearly 38 years in Blackheath, Camilla Crosland moved in 1886 to 29 Ondine Road, East Dulwich, where she died on 16 February 1895. A memorial window has been placed to her memory in St Alban's Cathedral. Works Crosland contributed work in many genres ‚Äì poems, stories illustrating the condition of the poor, essays, and biographical and historical sketches ‚Äì to periodicals such as The People's Journal, The London Journal, Bentley's Miscellany, the Old Monthly Magazine, The Illustrated London News, Douglas Jerrold's Magazine, Ainsworth's Magazine, and to annuals. For more than 50 years she was a regular contributor to Chambers's Journal, and at the time of her death she was its writer of longest standing. Crosland published Light in the Valley: My Experiences of Spiritualism (1857), which has been described as a \\"credulous record\\" and was received badly by the public. In 1865 she published a three-volume novel, Mrs. Blake; in 1871 the Diamond Wedding, and other Poems; and in 1873 a second novel, Hubert Freeth's Prosperity. Among her later productions were translations of Victor Hugo's plays, Hernani and Ruy Blas, with some of his poems, which appeared in Bohn's Library.\\"The Oubliettes\\", a poem by Camilla Dufour Crosland based on Victor Hugo, describing an offence against the modesty of a sleeping woman, can be read here: Retrieved 8 November 2015.

Khavinson has oversighted over 200 Ph.D. and Doctorate theses from many different countries.  Field of work  During 1973 - 2013 V. Kh. Khavinson et al., extracted from various organs over 20 complexes of physiologically active peptides, as well as 15 others synthesized from amino acids, (di-, tri-, tetrapeptides), all being covered by patents in many countries including the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, Japan, Korea, Israel, etc. After many years of experimental and clinical studies, six medicinal peptide preparations were permitted for medical use in the USSR, Russia, and afterward in the CIS countries. They were primarily to be used by the military medical service. These are ‚ÄòThymalin‚Äô- a preparation of the thymus, being a cellular immunity regulator; ‚ÄòEpithalamin‚Äô- a preparation from the pineal gland - regulator of the endocrine system, which restores melatonin, (with no analogues worldwide) ‚ÄòCortexin‚Äô- a preparation from the cerebral cortex, brain function regulator; ‚ÄòProstatilen‚Äô or ‚ÄòSamprost‚Äô or ‚ÄòVitaprost‚Äô- a preparation from the prostate gland, regulator of prostate function; ‚ÄòRetinalamin‚Äô- a preparation from the retina, partially restores functions of the retina in case of laser lesions and degenerative diseases, has no analogues worldwide; ‚ÄòThymogen‚Äô ‚Äì a dipeptide EW, being first extracted from ‚ÄòThymalin‚Äô, then synthesized from amino acids, regulates immunity . These medicinal peptide preparations were first used to restore immune functions of the brain, endocrine system, retina, etc. in military personnel exposed to high radiation, (during accidents at nuclear reactors), or to combat the action of toxic substances (including organophosphate compounds), combat traumas, as well as to prevent acute respiratory infections and flu. They were also used to treat laser retinal lesions in experimental animals exposed to a combat laser. All other peptide preparations, (natural and synthetic) are at different stages of studying in patients with different diseases. Among the important advantages of all designed peptide preparations is that they lack any toxic, allergic or adverse effects, this has been proven both in experimental and clinical studies. The main objective of studies for the recent decade was fundamental research devoted to the role that small peptides play in the evolution and development of living matter. It was crucial for understanding the mechanism of the action of peptides and evidencing their safety and effectiveness, whilst designing new medicinal preparations, dietary supplements, cosmetics and veterinary preparations.

His unique style of playing led him to be popularly known as Jhimmy the Hawaiian, or simply Jhimmy. Born in Brazzaville to a Congolese father and a mother from the Ubangi-Shari territory of Central African Republic, Zacharie Elenga initially had plans for the priesthood, but it is said that he had a fiery temperament and he was likely expelled from seminary by the priests. Subsequently he found employment, as a stenographer with the firm Solbena, a workshop that manufactured shirts, and was owned by Greek brothers Gabriel and Moussa Benathar. The Benathar brothers were proprietors of a number of businesses in the Belgian Congo and fortuitously they decided to launch the Opika recording company in challenge to the monopolistic Ngoma record label. In 1947, Elenga had been living in the Usoke Street area near Leopoldville‚Äôs city center, and it was there that he met Paul Mwanga. The two formed a musical collaboration named, ‚ÄúGroupe Jhimmy na Mwanga‚Äù (The Jhimmy and Mwanga Group), with Elenga playing rhythm guitar and Mwanga contributing vocals. The Benathar brothers had found ready stars in the Zacharie Elenga and Paul Mwanga duo, and they were signed almost as soon as Opika‚Äôs doors opened in 1949. Elenga had a unique way of stringing his guitar, choosing to replace the D string with a second E string, and picking the notes with his thumb and forefinger in a style that he called, ‚ÄúHawaiian.‚Äù Further, Zacharie Elenga named himself after American country legend Jimmy Rodgers, who he admired, but spelling Jhimmy with an ‚Äúh.‚Äù Hence he came to be known amongst his fans as Jhimmy the Hawaiian. While at Opika, Jhimmy joined a quintet including Paul Mwanga on vocals, Georges Doula, Albert Yamba-Yamba, and Francois ‚ÄòGobi‚Äô Boyimbo on guitars, and Etienne ‚ÄòBaskis‚Äô Diluvila on percussion. In his first recording at Opika, ‚ÄúOndruwe,‚Äù Jhimmy introduced the foxtrot to the Congolese public. This record with the song ‚ÄúHenriette‚Äù on the reverse side, featured Paul Mwana‚Äôs fine voice singing solo, but it was Jhimmy‚Äôs innovative playing style and advanced, harmonious composition that had substantial influence on other performers of the time. Between the years of 1950 and 1952 Jhimmy saw great success in his musical career, with popular fame reaching as far west as Gabon. He was even featured in a short film of the time, which was shown in Europe, called Jhimmy Chante (Jhimmy sings). In 1952, Jhimmy collaborated on some recordings with another Opika performer named Joseph Kabaselle, but these were to be the swan songs of his career and shortly after this he slipped into obscurity, never to record again.

The bill passed in the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. Background Sandia Pueblo is a federally recognized tribe of Native American Pueblo people inhabiting a reservation of the same name in the eastern Rio Grande Rift of central New Mexico. It is bounded by the city of Albuquerque to the south and by the foothills of the Sandia Mountains, a landform the people hold sacred and which was central to the traditional economy and remains important in the spiritual life of the community, to the east. A forested area known as the bosque surrounds the rest of the reservation, and serves as a source of firewood and wild game. A resident population of 4,414 was reported as of the 2000 census. Two communities located on its territory are Pueblo of Sandia Village and part (population 3,235) of the town of Bernalillo. A federally recognized tribe, Sandia Pueblo is one of 19 of New Mexico's Native American pueblos. The land that would be conveyed to the Sandia Pueblo is considered to have important spiritual and cultural meaning to the tribe. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Sandia Pueblo Settlement Technical Amendment Act would amend the T'uf Shur Bien Preservation Trust Area Act to require the Secretary of Agriculture, upon the receipt of certain consideration and at the request of the Sandia Pueblo of New Mexico and the Secretary of the Interior, to transfer certain National Forest land to the Secretary of the Interior to be held in trust for the Pueblo, provided a land exchange with the Pueblo required by that Act is not completed within 90 days of this Act's enactment. The bill would require that National Forest land to be preserved as open space in its natural state. The bill would also require the Pueblo to transfer to the Secretary, in exchange for such land, the Pueblo's La Luz tract and an amount equal to the difference between the value of: (1) the National Forest land as open space in its natural state, and (2) the La Luz tract and the compensation owed to the Pueblo by the Secretary for the right-of-way and conservation easement on its Piedra Lisa tract. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on October 30, 2013. This is a public domain source. S. 611 would require the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer certain lands in the Sandia Mountain Wilderness and Cibola National Forest in New Mexico to the United States Department of the Interior to be held in trust for the Pueblo of Sandia. In exchange for the specified National Forest lands, the legislation would require the Secretary of the Interior to transfer certain lands and easements held in trust for the Pueblo of Sandia to the Forest Service. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing S. 611 would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Based on information provided by the Forest Service, CBO estimates that the cost of administering the land transfers would be minimal. Enacting S. 611 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. S. 611 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would benefit the Pueblo of Sandia. Procedural history The Sandia Pueblo Settlement Technical Amendment Act was introduced into the United States Senate on March 19, 2013 by Sen. Tom Udall (D, NM). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. It was reported on January 28, 2014 alongside Senate Report 113-136. The bill passed in the Senate on March 12, 2014 by unanimous consent. On May 28, 2014, the United States House of Representatives voted to pass the bill in a voice vote. On June 9, 2014, President Barack Obama signed the bill into law, becoming .

The number 451 is a commonly misconceived as a reference to Ray Bradbury's 1953 dystopian novel Fahrenheit 451, in which books are outlawed. 451 provides more information than HTTP 403, which is often used for the same purpose. This status code is standardized in RFC 7725. Examples of situations where an HTTP 451 error code could be displayed include web pages deemed a danger to national security, or web pages deemed to violate copyright, privacy, blasphemy laws, or any other law or court order. The RFC is specific that a 451 response does not indicate whether the resource exists but requests for it have been blocked, if the resource has been removed for legal reasons and no longer exists, or even if the resource has never existed, but any discussion of its topic has been legally forbidden (see injunction). Some sites have previously returned HTTP 404 (missing) or similar if they are not legally permitted to disclose that the resource has been removed. It is used in England by some Internet service providers utilising the Internet Watch Foundation blacklist, returning a 404 message or another error message instead of showing a message indicating the site is blocked. The status code was formally proposed in 2013 by Tim Bray, following earlier informal proposals by Chris Applegate in 2008 and Terence Eden in 2012. It was approved by the IETF on December 18, 2015. It was published as RFC 7725 in February 2016. HTTP 451 was mentioned by the BBC's From Our Own Correspondent programme, as an indication of the effects of sanctions on Sudan and the inability to access Airbnb, the App Store, or other Western web services. After introduction of the GDPR in EEA many websites located outside EEA started to serve HTTP 451 instead of trying to comply with this new privacy law.  Usage  When an entity intercepts the request and returns status 451, it should include a \\"Link\\" HTTP header field whose value is a URI reference identifying itself. The \\"Link\\" header field must then have a \\"rel\\" parameter whose value is \\"blocked-by\\". This is intended to identify the entity implementing the blocking (an ISP, DNS provider, caching system, etc.), not the legal authority mandating the block. At an IETF hackathon, participants used a web crawler to discover that several implementations misunderstood this header and gave the legal authority instead.  Example  An American website unavailable in Europe because of the General Data Protection Regulation. HTTP/1.1 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons Link: ; rel=\\"blocked-by\\" Content-Type: text/html # Unavailable For Legal Reasons This request may not be serviced in the Roman Province of Judea due to the Lex Julia Majestatis, which disallows access to resources hosted on servers deemed to be operated by the People's Front of Judea.

Herman Wouk's novel was loosely based on the life of Thomas Wolfe, as written in the 1962 novel of the same name. Plot summary Youngblood Hawke is a Kentucky truck driver who moves to New York City with dreams of becoming a hot-shot writer. Almost immediately he meets editor Jeanne Green. She sees great promise in Hawke's writing and falls for the handsome Kentuckian while helping him put together his first book deal. His first novel is moderately successful, but is soon transformed into a Broadway play by a has-been stage actress. Jeanne discovers that Youngblood has an effect on a great many women, so she takes a new job at a new publishing company. Soon after, Hawke's second novel is heralded and he becomes the toast of the town. He then has an affair with a married socialite. His third novel bombs and is also panned by critics. Hawke's financial state declines and he has to move back to Kentucky. While in Kentucky working on his next book, he contracts pneumonia just before realizing that Jeanne was his true ideal woman. Cast Production In September 1962, Warner Bros announced that Delmer Daves would write, produce and direct a feature film based on the novel. Daves had previously made A Summer Place, Parrish, Susan Slade and Rome Adventure for the studio, all of which had starred Troy Donahue.MOVIE TO BE MADE BY PUBLICITY FIRM: Arthur Jacobs Plans to Use Own Stars for 'Louisa' By EUGENE ARCHER. New York Times 4 Sep 1962: 39. Daves spent time deciding which part of the novel he wanted to film. He decided to start with Hawke's rise while driving a truck and end with his recovery in hospital from a near death. The original script took six weeks to write. It was 140 pages in fine print which would have run six to seven hours. He then cut the script down after looking at various locations. The lead role was originally offered to Warren Beatty who demanded a fee of $200,000 plus script and cast approval. George Peppard, Stuart Whitman and Terence Stamp were also discussed.Warren Beatty May Lose 'Hawke' Role: Actor's Demands Revealed; Poitier Will Do 'Long Ships' Hopper, Hedda.

Though a small percentage of total consumption, its many waterways provide for a higher than average hydroelectric generation capacity. A higher than average solar exposure has recently begun to be taken advantage of in the state, with three solar photovoltaic generation facilities going online in 2016 and more under construction. Wind power potential is modest in Arkansas and the state has no utility-scale wind generation facilities. A network of 17 regional cooperatives, four investor-owned companies, and a number of municipal providers generate and deliver electricity to Arkansas customers. Five utilities deliver natural gas. Regulation The Arkansas Public Service Commission oversees all four of the state's natural gas utilities and 24 of its electric utilities. The commission lacks authority over 15 municipal providers. Policy Property assessed clean energy (PACE) Arkansas enacted property assessed clean energy (PACE) legislation in 2013. The law enables bonds to be issued in voluntarily created energy improvement districts that are then used to fund low-interest loans for renewable energy or efficiency upgrades. Cities Fayetteville and North Little Rock have since formed local energy improvement districts. Net metering Net metering rules in the state were first established by the Arkansas Public Service Commission in 2002 and were expanded in 2007. Energy generated by renewable systems up to 25 kilowatts for residential customers and up to 300 kilowatts for nonresidential is eligible. Under the law, utilities grant customers credits for excess energy fed to the grid. Unused credits at the end of a billing year are usable in the next billing year up to the customer's four-month average use in the previous year. Any additional credits are forfeited to the utility. Efficiency The American Council for an Energy- Efficient Economy ranked Arkansas 31st among the most energy-efficient states in 2017, down from 27th in 2016. Arkansas ranked 17th among fellow states in 2014 for overall per capita energy consumption. Electricity Arkansas consumed 48,194 million kilowatt hours in 2010. In 2012, the state exported 131 trillion more BTUs of electricity than it imported. =Rates= The average per-kilowatt-hour electricity rate in Arkansas was $0.08 in 2014, the fourth-lowest in the country. Rates by sector in 2014 were $0.10 for residential, $0.06 for industrial, and $0.08 for commercial. =Generation= Net generation by fuel source.U.S. Energy Information Administration, Electric Power Monthly, February In 2014, Arkansas had 14,754 megawatts of net summer generating capacity and generated 62 million megawatt hours. Generation facilities providing public power in the state include: * five coal-fired plants * 20 hydroelectric installations, including one pumped storage facility * 10 natural gas-fired plants * seven dual-fuel natural gas/petroleum-fired plants * six photovolatic solar facilities * two landfill gas facilities * one nuclear power plant * one petroleum-fired plant The state is home to the John W. Turk Jr. Coal Plant, which came online in 2012 as the first sustained ultra-supercritical coal-fired power plant in the United States. Arkansas total electric industry generation in megawatt hours by fuel type, 1990‚Äì2012. Emissions In 2014, Arkansas' power industry released 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, 66,524 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, and 33,229 metric tons of nitrogen oxides. In 2013, Arkansas ranked 30th in the most energy-related carbon dioxide emissions and 16th-highest for per capita energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. Solar power A 2010 report by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance estimated Arkansas could generate 19 percent of its 2007 energy need solely from rooftop solar photovoltaics. Three utility-scale solar photovoltaic generation facilities began operating in Arkansas in 2016: * The state's first utility-scale solar facility, a 12-megawatt farm in East Camden serving an Aerojet Rocketdyne manufacturing facility. Excess energy from the farm is sold to the public electrical grid. * A 1-megawatt farm in Springdale operated by the Ozarks Electric Cooperative * A 0.5-megawatt farm in Van Buren operated by the Arkansas Valley Electric Cooperative In 2017, the 81-megawatt Stuttgart Solar Energy Center began operating in Stuttgart. Two solar photovoltaic facilities are in progress: * The 100-megawatt Chicot Solar Project will be the state's largest solar facility upon completion. * A 6.5-megawatt facility is planned to open in 2018 in Clarksville. A 1.2-megawatt array for a L'Or√©al manufacturing facility in North Little Rock is scheduled to be operational in mid-2017. Notable small-scale solar power installations include rooftop photovoltaics on the Fayetteville Public Library and the Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock. Wind power The U.S. Department of Energy estimates the state has 9,200 megawatts of potential wind power capacity at 80 meters. Arkansas is one of 9 U.S. states and the District of Columbia without utility- scale wind power. Other renewables Arkansas is 14th among states with the most installed hydroelectric generating capacity and 16th with the most generation from biomass. In 2011, hydroelectric installations generated 2,992 million kilowatt hours, while 1,668 million kilowatt hours were generated from biomass, mostly from wood products. =Providers= Arkansas' electric providers include four investor- owned utilities and a number of municipal and regional cooperative providers. Generation and transmission cooperative Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation provides wholesale energy to 17 regional member cooperatives in the state. Natural gas Natural gas extraction from Arkansas' Fayetteville Shale, 2000‚Äì2013. =Rates= In 2015, average natural gas rates per thousand cubic feet were $11.58 for residential, $8.43 for commercial, and $6.91 for industrial customers. =Production= The Fayetteville Shale, a narrow Mississippian age geological formation that runs across the center of the state, accounts for nearly all of Arkansas natural gas production. Proven reserves of dry natural gas in the state were estimated at 12,789 billion cubic feet in 2014. Marketed natural gas production in Arkansas more than doubled from 2008 to 2010. In 2014, natural gas production amounted to 1.12 million cubic feet, ranking it eighth-highest among fellow states. Arkansas accounted for 4.1 percent of U.S. production of marketed natural gas in 2014. Fracking More than 1,000 minor earthquakes in 2010 and 2011 in Greenbrier led to the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission to close several hydraulic fracturing wells. Scientists at the University of Memphis and the Arkansas Geological Survey determined the quakes were likely caused by underground fracking wastewater disposal. Local residents filed five lawsuits in federal court against Chesapeake Operating Inc and BHP Billiton. =Providers= Petroleum =Production= Oil drilling began in south Arkansas in 1920 with the Hunter No. 1 well installed in Ouachita County. Commercial oil production began in 1921 with the S.T. Busey well in Union County near El Dorado. Proven petroleum reserves in the state were estimated at 55 million barrels in 2012, revised up from 40 million barrels in 2011.

Only one was built. Design and development In the 1960s, Andr√© Merville was president of the Boulogne- based company Helice G. Merville, which had been the chief supplier of wooden propellers for French aircraft since the end of World War I. He sought to broaden the firm's product range by producing both light aircraft and gliders. The SM.31 high- performance sailplane was a development of their S.30 (sometimes written SM.30). It is a wood-framed aircraft, covered with a mixture of plywood and fabric. Its wing was built around a single spar with ply covering from the spar around the leading edge and fabric aft. The smooth ply skin covers just over half the chord, matching the approximate distance over which the ideal NACA airfoil 654421 maintains laminar flow; the rest is fabric-covered, though the covering of the plain ailerons is a ply and fabric mixture. In plan the wing has a rectangular centre section reaching out to about 60% of the span. Its square tipped outer sections have a swept leading edge, giving them a 6¬∞ sweep at quarter chord and a taper ratio of 65%. The ailerons are each in two parts, operating differentially and occupying about 63% of the span; the rest of the trailing edge is filled with lift-increasing Fowler flaps. There are Schempp-Hirth type air brakes on the inner section at 57% chord. The wings are shoulder mounted with a dihedral of 2.5¬∞. The fuselage of the SM.31 is ply covered over wooden frames and stringers. In section it is ovoid, deep and narrow in the single-seat cockpit area ahead of the wings. Its single-piece, blown perspex canopy occupies most of this forward region. It has a rounded profile which curves upwards into the upper fuselage line just ahead of the wing and is side opening. Aft, the fuselage tapers slowly to the tail, where the straight tapered tailplane and elevators are mounted on top. The fin is faired into the fuselage at its root but elsewhere the vertical tail is straight tapered and flat topped. The rudder, hinged behind the elevator trailing edge and extending down to the keel, is not balanced. All the fixed tail surfaces are ply covered, with fabric covered control surfaces. The SM.31 lands on a semi-recessed, unsprung monowheel, fitted with brakes and assisted by a fixed skid which stretches from nose the under the wing trailing edge together with a tail bumper protecting the rudder. The SM.31's first flight was made on 11 January 1960. The sole example still exists, though neither airworthy nor on display. Whether it is F-CCHN in the Ailes Ancienne collection in Toulouse or F-CBYK at the Mus√©e R√©gional de l'Air at Angers is not certain; one is probably the SM.30 and the other the SM.31.

It was launched by minister Paulo Renato Souza through the Secretariat for Development, Innovation and Educational Evaluation (SEDIAE) on an experimental basis on September 4, 1995 in two schools of Teresina, Piau√≠. Its first nationwide broadcast occurred on March 4, 1996. On May 27, 1996, the Ministry of Education of Brazil extinguished SEDIAE and created the Secretariat for Distance Education (SEED) to assign TV Escola. Aimed to teachers, it was created to support them as an educational tool, and both to supplement their own training, and for use in their teaching practices. The oldest of two Federal programs created to support technological innovation in Brazil, TV Escola also distributes television sets, videocassette recorders, and satellite dishes to schools.

It is designed to give students the skills to progress to any university or higher educational institution.Decreto del Presidente della Repubblica 89/2010 - Regolamento di revisione dei licei. Available here. Retrieved 14 December 2011. Students can attend the liceo linguistico after successfully completing middle school (scuola media). The curriculum is devised by the Ministry of Education, and emphasises the link between the multiculturalism and language learning. It covers a complete and widespread range of disciplines.Decreto del Presidente della Repubblica 89/2010, Appendix F - Regolamento di revisione dei licei, Allegato F. Available here. Retrieved 14 December 2011. Students typically study for five years, and attend the school from the age of 14 to 19. At the end of the fifth year all students sit for the esame di Stato, a final examination which gives access to every university course. A student attending a liceo is called liceale, although the more generic terms studente (male) and studentessa (female) are also in common use. Teachers are known as professore (male) or professoressa (female). Subjects During five years, students learn three foreign languages (including English) and acquire a rich humanistic and scientific culture. At the end of the final year, the language proficiency of students is minimum B2. This is the weekly schedule of liceo linguistico in 5 years: *Italian language and literature - Four hours during 5 years *Latin language and literature - Two hours in the first and second year *English language and literature - Four hours in the first and second year, then three hours in the last three years *Second foreign language and literature - Three hours in the first and second year, then four hours in the last three years *Third foreign language and literature - Three hours in the first and second year, then four hours in the last three years *History and Geography - Three hours in the first and second year *History - Two hours in the last three years *Philosophy - Two hours in the last three years *Mathematics and Computer science - Three hours in the first and second year *Mathematics - Two hours in the last three years *Biology, Chemistry and Earth science - Two hours during 5 years *Physics - Two hours in the last three years *History of Art - Two hours in the last three years *Physical education - Two hours during 5 years *Religious education or other activity - One hour during 5 years Final exam According to the law, students of the liceo linguistico must sit several written tests alongside a final interdisciplinary oral test. The first written exam is the Italian one, in which the student has to choose one text to analyse between three main categories: a poetic text, an argumentative essay or a contemporary essay. The second written test includes two texts in two languages (English obligatory + another language) to analyse and two essays to write. Finally, there is an oral exam, in which the candidate is tested in several subjects. EsaBac If students study French language and literature in an EsaBac course, at the end of high school they must take a French history and French literature exam. Once passed, the student receive the Esame di Stato (the final exam in Italy) and the Baccalaur√©at (the final exam in France). The language proficiency of students that attain that exam is minimum B2. University After Liceo Linguistico, a student can enter any university faculty (from foreign languages to philosophy, mathematics, physics, medicine, chemistry, etc.). As well as in other licei in Italy, academic preparation is performed from the first to the last year.

Capacity is limited by the crimp seen slightly below the 10-round witness hole, for compliance with the high-capacity magazine ban in Massachusetts. A high-capacity magazine ban is a law which bans or otherwise restricts high-capacity magazines, detachable firearm magazines that can hold more than a certain number of rounds of ammunition. For example, in the United States, the now-expired Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 included limits regarding magazines that could hold more than ten rounds. Eight U.S. states, and a number of local governments, ban or regulate magazines that they have legally defined as high- capacity. The majority of states (42) do not ban or regulate any magazines on the basis of capacity. States that do have large capacity magazine bans or restrictions typically do not apply to firearms with fixed magazines whose capacity would otherwise exceed the large capacity threshold. The federal ban which was in effect from 1994 to 2004 defined a magazine capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition as a large capacity ammunition feeding device. Likewise, the state of California defines a large capacity magazine as \\"any ammunition feeding device with a capacity to accept more than 10 rounds.\\" Such devices are commonly called high-capacity magazines. Among states with bans, the maximum capacity is 10 to 20 rounds. Several municipalities, such as New York City, restrict magazine capacity to 5 rounds for rifles and shotguns. The state of New York previously limited magazine capacity to 7 rounds, but a District Court ruled this ban to be excessive and could not \\"survive intermediate scrutiny\\". Most pistols sold in the U.S. are made and sold with magazines holding between 10 and 17 rounds. In November 2013, the National Rifle Association sued the city of San Francisco over an ordinance banning possession of magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds. In March 2014, the Supreme Court refused to halt a similar ban by the city of Sunnyvale, California. In March 2019, a United States District court in California declared magazine restrictions to be a violation of the Second Amendment and issued an injunction against the state's enforcement of the 10-round maximum capacity magazine. Duncan v. Becerra This would be upheld in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on August 14, 2020. Magazine bans by country =Canada= With the passage of Bill C-17 in 1993 under Prime Minister Kim Campbell (in response to the 1989 Ecole Polytechnique Massacre), magazines designed for use in semi-automatic centrefire rifles and semi-automatic shotguns became limited to five rounds, and magazines designed for use in handguns are limited to 10 rounds. Magazines designed for use in semi-automatic rimfire rifles, as well as manually operated long guns, are exempt from the magazine capacity restrictions. In recent years, there has been a growing trend of ways to legally work around the magazine capacity restrictions. Numerous semi- automatic centrefire rifles also happen to accept handgun magazines, thereby legally increasing magazine capacity. Numerous rifle and handgun magazines designed for a particular caliber also happen to fit an over-the-limit number of smaller caliber rounds, also legally increasing magazine capacity. =United Kingdom= There is no ban, restriction or other additional legal requirements on the possession, purchase, sale or import of high capacity magazines in the UK that are designed for use in rifles, shotguns and pistols. However, since January 1989 all semi automatic rifles (other then those chambered for .22 rimfire cartridges) and since February 1998 all semi automatic pistols have been generally prohibited for possession by the general public without a section 5 firearms licence due to legislation enacted after the 1987 Hungerford Massacre on semi automatic rifles and after the 1996 Dunblane Massacre on semi automatic pistols. Before those respective dates a member of the public could own them on a standard section 1 firearms licence. This means that even though high capacity magazines are legal, they can only be legally used on semi automatic rifles owned by citizens with a section 1 firearms licence if they are chambered to fire .22 rimfire cartridges only. Additionally though long barreled pistols (pistols with a barrel length of at least 12 inches) can still be owned on a section 1 firearms licence as the legislation on pistols passed in February 1998 only affected firearms with a barrel length of less than 12 inches meaning that long barreled pistols are in effect regulated along the same lines as .22 rimfire semi automatic rifles meaning that long barreled pistols can utilize high capacity magazines, though only chambered to .22 rimfire cartridges like semi automatic rifles. Revolvers are not classed as semi automatic under UK law and thus can be owned in any caliber, however they must still have a barrel length of at least 12 inches like semi automatic rifles and pistols if owned on a section 1 firearms licence. As for bolt action, straight pull, lever release and any other manually loading rifles they can be owned in any caliber however and utilize high capacity magazines also. As for shotguns there is legislation on all lever action, pump action and semi automatic shotguns that restricts them to holding a maximum of 3 cartridges at any one time if they are held on a section 2 shotgun licence. However shotguns with an unlimited capacity can be held on the more strict section 1 firearms licence if an applicant provides a 'good reason' to the chief officer of their local police force as to why they need a shotgun with a capacity over 3 shots, typically a 'good reason' would be for example those hunting or controlling dangerous animals (such as wild boar/hogs) or those who need to control large numbers of pests at once (such as herds of rabbits). More can be found here Firearms policy in the United Kingdom. =United States= Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 William B. Ruger, a founder of Sturm, Ruger & Co., is often ascribed with providing the impetus for high capacity magazine restrictions. Ruger proposed that instead of banning firearms, Congress should outlaw magazines holding more than 15 rounds. ‚ÄúNo honest man needs more than 10 rounds in any gun,‚Äù Ruger told Tom Brokaw of NBC News in 1992. On March 30, 1989, Ruger sent a letter to every member of the US Congress stating: > \\"The best way to address the firepower concern is therefore not to try to > outlaw or license many millions of older and perfectly legitimate firearms > (which would be a licensing effort of staggering proportions) but to > prohibit the possession of high capacity magazines. By a simple, complete > and unequivocal ban on large capacity magazines, all the difficulty of > defining 'assault rifle' and 'semi-automatic rifles' is eliminated. The > large capacity magazine itself, separate or attached to the firearm, becomes > the prohibited item. A single amendment to Federal firearms laws could > effectively implement these objectives.\\" William B. Ruger The Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 included a ban on magazines capable of holding more than ten rounds of ammunition. The Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, commonly called the assault weapons ban (AWB), was enacted in September 1994. The ban, including its ban on magazines capable of holding more than ten rounds of ammunition, became defunct (expired) in September 2004 per a sunset provision. Attempts to renew the ban have failed on the federal level. State high-capacity magazine bans As of April 2019, Washington, D.C. and nine U.S. states have high-capacity magazine restrictions or bans. * *Colorado (on in-state sales of magazines with a capacity of 16 rounds or greater) *Connecticut *Hawaii (on handguns only) *Maryland (on in-state sales of magazines with a capacity of 11 rounds or greater) *Massachusetts *New Jersey *New York *Vermont (10 round magazine limit on rifles and a 15 round limit on handguns) In Virginia, high-capacity magazines, which are defined as being over 20 rounds for a semi-automatic, centerfire rifle or pistol, and 7 shells for a shotgun, are not in and of themselves banned, but using one in combination with a firearm changes its status to an \\"assault firearm\\" which is prohibited for foreign nationals without permanent resident to possess,http://www.roanoke.com/news/crime/montgomery_county/former-virginia- tech-student-was-allowed-to-have-gun- but/article_47983e3e-6501-56aa-b328-b61f7e4989df.html as well as requiring a license to carry in certain counties and cities.

Cuomo, 804 F.3d 242 (2d Cir. 2015) In December 2013, the National Rifle Association (NRA), representing five residents of Sunnyvale, California, filed a lawsuit to stop enforcement of the city's ban on possession of magazines able to hold more than 10 rounds, in a case known as Fyock v. Sunnyvale. In March 2014, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy rejected a request to block enforcement of the law pending appeals. In March 2015 the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the magazine capacity restriction, ruling that it does not violate the Second Amendment.Mintz, Howard (March 4, 2015). \\"Gun Rights Showdown: Sunnyvale Restrictions Upheld by Appeals Court\\", San Jose Mercury News. Retrieved March 7, 2015. Eugene Volokh, constitutional scholar, says that a Federal District Court judge was correct to decide that a local high- capacity magazine ban was constitutional, comparing limits on magazine capacity to limits on free speech. In March of 2019, a Federal District Court judge struck down California's high-capacity magazine ban, noting that \\"[u]nder the simple test of Heller, California's ¬ß 32310 directly infringes Second Amendment rights\\". The decision was suspended after six days, pending further litigation. On August 14th, 2020, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that held California‚Äôs ban on so-called ‚Äúlarge-capacity magazines‚Äù (LCMs) violates the Second Amendment, in a 2-1 decision. Public opinion In 2012 62% of Americans favored banning the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines, according to a Gallup poll with a margin of error of +/- 4%. In 2017 65% of American adults supported banning high-capacity magazines, according to a Pew Research Center survey with an error attributable to sampling of +/- 2.8% at the 95% level of confidence. In late February early March 2018, after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, 63% of American adults supported a ban on the sale and possession of high-capacity or extended ammunition magazines, according to a CNN poll with a margin of error of +/- 3.7%. 73% of American adults supported banning high-capacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, according to an NPR/Ipsos poll with a margin of error of +/- 3.5%. 70% of registered voters supported banning high- capacity magazines, according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll with a margin of error +/- 2%. Hunting Some jurisdictions apply magazine limits to hunters. For example, Maine and Oregon have a 5-cartridge limit on auto- loading firearms for hunting. Impact A 2004 study examining the effects of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban in effect from 1994 to 2004 which included a prohibition on sales of magazines with over ten rounds. The study found that, while the ban was effective at reducing crimes committed with assault weapons, the ban was not associated with a reduction in firearm homicides or the lethality of gun crimes in general. The authors suggest this may be due to the concurrent rise in use of non-banned semiautomatic weapons with large capacity magazines. The authors note that high-capacity magazines have a greater potential for affecting gun crime as compared to assault weapons due to the fact that high-capacity magazines are used in firearms not classified as assault weapons. The authors further note, \\"However, it is not clear how often the ability to fire more than 10 shots without reloading (the current magazine capacity limit) affects the outcomes of gun attacks.\\" Overall the authors reported that \\"there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury, as we might have expected had the ban reduced crimes with both AWs and LCMs.\\" The authors speculated that \\"Nonetheless, reducing crimes with AWs and especially LCMs could have nontrivial effects on gunshot victimizations. As a general matter, hit rates tend to be low in gunfire incidents, so having more shots to fire rapidly can increase the likelihood that offenders hit their targets, and perhaps bystanders as well.\\" A 2018 Rand Corporation review concluded that effects of a ban on LCMs pertaining to firearm homicides in general were uncertain as the studies examined in the review were inconclusive in demonstrating a significant effect.https://www.rand.org/research/gun- policy/analysis/ban-assault-weapons/violent-crime.html A 2019 study found that mass shootings (defined as those resulting in six or more fatalities) involving high-capacity magazines \\"resulted in a 62% higher mean average death toll\\" than mass shootings in which high-capacity magazines were not used. States which had banned high-capacity magazines had a substantially lower incidence of mass shootings, as well as far fewer fatalities in mass shootings.

Early life Eric Walter was born in Saint-Mand√©, France, in 1950. He went to the Hector Berlioz school Vincennes (near Paris) where he obtained a scientific baccalaureat in 1968. He received the Doctorat d‚Äô√âtat degree in control theory from the University of Paris Sud, France, in 1980. Between 1973 and 1976, he was assistant professor at the Pierre et Marie Curie University, Paris. Then he entered the CNRS institute as a researcher. Career During his Ph.D. thesis, Eric Walter studied the notion of identifiability which makes it possible to understand from the structure of a parametric system if an estimation procedure can provide some estimates for the parameter vector once the measurements have been collected. Later, with Luc Pronzato and H√©l√®ne Piet Lahanier, he worked with bounded-error estimation methods using Monte-Carlo techniques and with linear tools (ellipsoids or polytopes). In 1995, with Luc Jaulin, Olivier Didrit and Michel Kieffer, he introduced the use of interval techniques to solve the problem of set inversion with some application to guaranteed nonlinear estimation. Up to May 2014, he was Directeur de Recherche at CNRS (the French national center for scientific research). His research interests revolve around parameter estimation in a bounded-error context with outliers and its application to chemical engineering, chemistry, control, image processing, medicine pharmacokinetics, and robotics. He was head of the 'Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst√®mes' for 2002-2009.

Left: the Haardt; centre: the Weinstra√üe hills; right: the Rhine Plain The Weinstra√üe, also referred to as the Middle Haardt (Mittelhardt), is a region within the Palatinate in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate that was named after the German Wine Road or Deutsche Weinstra√üe.  Geography  In a geological sense the Weinstra√üe is an altitudinal belt (H√∂henstufe) that is just under 150 metres high in the centre. It is part of the South German Scarplands and forms a hilly zone, about 85 kilometres long and 10 to 15 kilometres wide, that separates the Upper Rhine Plain from the mountains of the Palatine Forest. Its eastern edge is formed by the Haardt with its highest point, the Kalmit (673 m). The German Wine Road runs longitudinally through the region.  Climate  Favourable thermals cause warm air to climb up the slopes at night, whilst cold air flows down onto the plain, so that on the vine-covered hillsides of the Weinstra√üe there is a low risk of frost at the time when the vines flower in spring. Thanks to these favourable climatic conditions, fig and almond trees are also grown here in the open as are kiwi fruits and lemons.  Economy  The Weinstra√üe is the largest part of the Palatine wine region. The main sources of income are wine growing and tourism, which are often marketed together. The wine-growing districts of the Weinstra√üe are described in the article on the Palatine wine region.  Transport  The Bundesstra√üe 271 federal road runs along the northern part of the Weinstra√üe,whilst the southern part is crossed by the B 38 federal road and A 65 motorway. Two railways cross the area: the line from Landau to Neustadt (formerly the Palatine Maximilian Railway) and the Neustadt to Monsheim line (formerly the Palatine Northern Railway). Train services on both run to the Rheinland-Pfalz-Takt timetable system.

He was briefly Minister of Finance towards the end of 1848. Early years Ariste Jacques Trouv√©-Chauvel was born in La Suze-sur-Sarthe, Sarthe, on 8 November 1805 (17 Brumaire year XIV). He was the son of Ren√© Trouv√© (1781-1850) and Anne-Magdeleine-Louise Dorizon (1783-1845). His family came from Fill√©, on the Sarthe River, about south of Le Mans. They became merchants and then tanners at La Suze. Trouv√©-Chauvel studied at the School of Commerce in Paris. He worked for a merchant in Le Havre from 1826 to 1830, and then spent three years in manufacturing companies in England, Scotland and Ireland. When he returned to France he had become a believer in economic liberalism. In 1833 he set up business in Le Mans as a wholesale dealer in linen, muslin and lace. He was associated with a wholesale lace merchant, Louis-Fran√ßois Chauvel, whose daughter he married in 1834. He soon expanded his operations to discounting letter of exchange and settling commercial trades, a common practice at the time when there were no banks in the provinces to provide these services. Banker and politician Trouv√©- Chauvel became an alderman of Le Mans in 1833 and General Counsel of the Sarthe in 1839. He became an ally of Fran√ßois Sevin, and on 9 August 1838 co- signed with Sevin a proposal for a Commercial, Industrial and Agricultural Bank of Sarthe. However, given their republican views they could not win government approval for a public limited company. The minister recommended that they create a society that could not issue shares, and they accepted this restriction, in 1840 creating a Caisse commerciale industrielle et agricole de la Sarthe. The name Caisse was chosen rather than Banque to avoid regulation by the Banque de France, which wanted to restrict competition. The same year they opened branches in Sabl√©, La Fl√®che and Paris. Over the next few years Trouv√©-Chauvel also launched enterprises such as an insurance company, mills and a barge company. In 1840 Trouv√©-Chauvel was appointed mayor of Le Mans, despite his Republican views. He gave a speech during a visit to the town by Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours that criticized the Orleans regime. He was dismissed along with all the other council members. A few days later he was reelected as councilor and soon after as deputy mayor. Second Republic politician Caricature by Honor√© Daumier, December 1848. The caption reads in part \\"Rigid guardian of the Republic, citizen Trouve-Chauvel is never separated from the treasure when he goes to the National Assembly. It is true that it is very easy to carry on his shoulder...\\". Trouv√©-Chauvel was returned as Mayor of Le Mans after the February Revolution of 1848, and was named General Commissioner of the Republic in the departments of Maine-et-Loire and Mayenne. The revolution had aggravated the economic crisis that began in 1847, and the Caisse de la Sarthe found itself in serious difficulty. Trouv√©-Chauvel managed to organize a mutual credit association of the bankers of Sarthe, Orne, Mayenne and Maine-et-Loire, which became a National Discount Counter that began to operate on 15 May 1848. By this time Trouv√©-Chauvel was absorbed in political issues and could spare no time for the banking business. On 23 April 1848 Trouv√©-Chauvel was elected to the Constituent Assembly as representative of Sarthe, sitting with the more moderate Republicans. He was Prefect of Police in Paris from 18 May 1848 to 19 July 1948. He backed up General Louis-Eug√®ne Cavaignac during the June Days Uprising from June 23 to 26. On 19 July 1948 he was appointed Prefect of the Seine. He was replaced as Prefect of Police by Fran√ßois Joseph Ducoux. On 25 October 1848 Trouv√©-Chauvel was appointed Minister of Finance in the cabinet of General Cavaignac, holding office until the cabinet was dissolved on 20 December 1848. He was not reelected to the legislature after the election of Prince Louis Napoleon Bonaparte to the Presidency. Later years In January 1849 the Caisse de la Sarthe was placed in liquidation. Trouv√©-Chauvel was appointed liquidator of the Caisse, but his political opponents determined to destroy him. He and the other Republicans were routed in the legislative elections of 13 May 1849. In December 1850 Trouv√©-Chauvel was dismissed from his position as liquidator of the Caisse de la Sarthe. When the coup of 2 December 1851 was announced, a false rumor was spread in Le Mans of the failure of the Caisse de la Sarthe. On the morning on 5 December 1851 he took up arms with the workers of his tannery at La Suze, but when the success of the coup was confirmed he fled the country. He took refuge in Jersey, then London and finally Brussels. There he found Victor Hugo and made plans to launch a liberal periodical, but the project was abandoned due to lack of funds. Trouv√©-Chauvel was granted a special amnesty on 6 August 1854. Around 1858-60 he was the Paris agent for English bankers engaged in speculations in French railways in Algeria. Ariste Jacques Trouv√©-Chauvel died in the 17th arrondissement of Paris on 14 October 1883. He was aged 77.

Founding According to North Korean sources, the origins of the Workers' Party of Korea can be traced to the Down-with-Imperialism Union, which was supposedly founded on October 17, 1926 and led by Kim Il-sung, then 14 years old. It is described in these sources as \\"the first genuine revolutionary communist organization in Korea.\\"Kim Il-sung. Works Vol. I. Pyongyang: Foreign Languages Publishing House. 1980. p. 467. The Workers' Party of North Korea was formed on 29 August 1946 from a merger between the Communist Party of North Korea and the New Democratic Party of Korea.Kim Il- sung. Works Vol. 2. Pyongyang: Foreign Languages Publishing House. 1980. p. 327. On June 30, 1949, the Workers Party of North Korea and the Workers' Party of South Korea merged, forming the Workers' Party of Korea, at a congress in Pyongyang. Both parties traced their origins to the Communist Party of Korea. Kim Il-sung of the Workers Party of North Korea became the party Chairman and Pak Hon-yong, who had been leader of the Workers Party of South Korea as well as the earlier Communist Party of Korea, and Ho Ka-i, . becoming deputy chairmen. There were a total of ten members of the first DPRK Politiburo. The other members were Yi Sung-yop, Kim Sam-yong, Kim Chaek, Kim Tu-bong, Pal Il-u, and Pak Chong-ae. Most were later purged by Kim Il-sung. However, official North Korean sources consider October 10, 1945 as the 'Party Foundation Day', citing a founding meeting of the founded under Soviet guidance. Foreign historians, however, dispute that date and claim that the meeting was in fact held on October 13. The party considers itself as a direct continuation of the North Korea Bureau and the Workers Party of North Korea, considering the two congresses of the Workers Party of North Korea as its own. This version of events can be seen as a move to downplay the importance of the communists from South Korea, who were purged in the 1950s. The first five years of the WPK's rule were dominated by the Korean War. By October 1950, United Nations forces had occupied most of the DPRK and the WPK leadership had to flee to China. Many believe that if it had not been for Chinese intervention, the Korean communists would have been militarily defeated at that point. But in November, Chinese forces entered the war and threw the U.N. forces back, retaking Pyongyang in December and Seoul in January 1951. In March U.N. forces retook Seoul, and the front was stabilised along what eventually became the permanent \\"Armistice Line\\" of 1953. The WPK was able to re-establish its rule north of this line. Education of new state apparatus In preparing to build the party-state according to the tradition in other states of the communist bloc, Kim Il-sung quoted Joseph Stalin's statement that \\"cadres decide everything\\", and thrust the cadre policy into the forefront of issues needing attention.Sheila Fitzpatrick, \\"The Cultural Front: Power and Culture in Revolutionary Russia\\" The first problem was that trained workers were in extraordinarily short supply. Kim himself realized the severity of this problem, saying in June 1946 that \\"If we have about 500 trained cadres, then we can dispatch one hundred to each of the five provinces to solve the shortage problem. But, we do not have such trained cadres\\".Kim Il sung, \\"The Central Party School is a Communist University for the Education of Party Cadres, June 3, 1946\\", in \\"Collected Works of Kim Il-sung\\", 1979. Accordingly, he started to establish schools for the educating of bureaucrats who would be appointed to the party military and cabinet. In February 1946, Pyongyang Institute opened its doors to students who would soon become relatively high-ranking military leaders, and three months later, the Training Institute for Security Officers and the Central Party School began educating military officers and party cadres respectively.Kim Il-sung 's military thought, Institute for North Korean Studies, Seoul, 1978, p.223 Factions As the Workers' Party of Korea, and its two founding parties, had emerged through a series of mergers, it contained various competing factions. At the time of its foundation, the party was made up of four factions, the Soviet Koreans faction, the Domestic faction, the Yanan (or Chinese) faction and the Guerrilla faction. * The Soviet Koreans, led first by Alexei Ivanovich Hegay and then by Pak Chang Ok were made up of waves of ethnic Koreans who were born or raised in Russia after their families moved there starting in the 1870s. Some of them had returned to Korea covertly as Communist operatives in the twenties and thirties but most were members of the Red Army or civilians who were stationed in North Korea following World War II to help the Red Army establish a Soviet satellite. Many came as translators or as Russian language instructors. * The Domestic faction, led by Pak Hon-yong were Korean Communists who never left the country but engaged in a struggle against the Japanese occupation. Many members of the domestic faction had spent time in Japanese military prisons as a result of their activities. They were the ones who agitated that the Korean People's Army take the lead in national reunification through military means. * The Yanan faction, led first by Mu Chong and then by Kim Tu-bong and Choe Chang-ik, were those Korean exiles who had lived in China's Shaanxi province and joined the Communist Party of China whose regional headquarters were at Yan'an. They had formed their own party, the North-Chinese League for the Independence of Korea, and when they returned to North Korea from exile they formed the New People's Party which merged with the North Korean Bureau to form the Workers Party of North Korea. Many members of the Yanan faction had fought in the Chinese 8th and New 4th Armies and thus had close relations with Mao Zedong. * The Guerrilla faction, led by Kim Il- sung, was made up of former Korean guerillas who had been active in Manchuria after it was occupied by Japan in 1931. Many in this group ended up fleeing Manchuria, as their armed resistance was suppressed, and moved to the Soviet Union where many of them, including Kim, were drafted into the Red Army. Once the WPK was created there was a virtual parity between the four factions with the Yanan, Soviet and Domestic factions each having four representatives on the Politburo with the Guerrilla faction having three. In the early years of the party, Kim Il-sung was the acknowledged leader, but he did not yet have absolute power, since it was necessary to balance off the interests of the various factions. To eliminate any threats to his position, he first moved against individual leaders who were potential rivals. He drove from power Alexei Ivanovich Hegay (also known as H≈è Ka-i), leader of the Soviet faction, first demoting him during the Korean War in 1951 and then using him as a scapegoat for slow repairs of a water reservoir bombed by the Americans to drive him from power (and to an alleged suicide) in 1953. In part, it was possible for Kim to do this because the intervention of \\"Chinese People's Volunteers\\" in the war reduced the influence of both the USSR and the Soviet faction and allowed Kim Il-sung the room he needed to dispose of his main rival. Kim Il-sung also attacked the leadership of the Yanan faction. When the North Koreans were driven to the Chinese border, Kim Il-sung needed a scapegoat to explain the military disaster and blamed Mu Chong, a leader of the Yanan faction and also a leader of the North Korean military. Mu Chong and a number of other military leaders were expelled from the party and Mu was forced to return to China where he spent the rest of his life. Kim Il-sung also removed Pak Il-u, the Minister of the Interior and reputedly the personal representative of Mao Zedong. The sacking of Hegay, Mu and Pak reduced the influence of the Chinese and Soviet factions, but Kim Il-sung could not yet launch an all out assault on these factions because he would risk the intervention of Moscow and Beijing when he was still dependent on their support. Purge of the \\"Domestic faction\\" As the Korean War drew to a close, Kim Il-sung first moved against the Domestic faction. While the Soviet faction had the sponsorship of the Soviet Union, and the Yanan faction was backed by China, the Domestic faction had no external sponsor who would come to their aid, and was therefore in the weakest position. With the end of the Korean War, the usefulness of the Domestic faction in running guerilla and spy networks in South Korea came to an end. Former leaders of the Workers Party of South Korea were attacked at a December 1952 Central Committee meeting. In early 1953, rumours were spread that the \\"southerners\\" had been planning a coup. This led to the arrest and removal from power of Pak Hon-yong (who was foreign minister at the time) and Yi Sung Yop the minister of \\"state control\\" who was charged with \\"spying on behalf of the United States\\". In August 1953, following the signing of the armistice that suspended the Korean War, Yi and eleven other leaders of the domestic faction were subjected to a show trial on charges of planning a military coup and sentenced to death. In 1955, Pak Hon- yong, the former leader of the WPSK and deputy chairman of the WPK, was put on trial on charges of having been a US agent since 1939, sabotage, assassination, and planning a coup. He was sentenced to death, although it is unclear if he was shot immediately or if his execution occurred some time in 1956. The trials of Yi and Pak were accompanied by the arrest of other members and activists of the former SWPK, with defendants being executed or sent to forced labour in the countryside. The domestic faction was virtually wiped out, though a few individual members who had personally allied themselves to Kim Il-sung remained in positions of influence for several more years. The \\"August Incident\\" and aftermath Kim Il-sung sent out preliminary signals in late 1955 and early 1956 that he was preparing to move against the Yanan and Soviet factions. The Twentieth Party Congress of the Soviet Communist Party was a bombshell with Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech denouncing Joseph Stalin and the inauguration of destalinisation. Throughout the Soviet bloc domestic Communist parties inaugurated campaigns against personality cults and the general secretaries who modelled themselves after Stalin were deposed throughout Eastern Europe. Kim Il-sung was summoned to Moscow for six weeks in the summer of 1956 in order to receive a dressing down from Khrushchev, who wished to bring North Korea in line with the new orthodoxy. During Kim Il- sung's absence, Pak Chang Ok (the new leader of the Soviet faction after the suicide of Ho Ka Ai), Choe Chang Ik, and other leading members of the Yanan faction devised a plan to attack Kim Il-sung at the next plenum of the Central Committee and criticise him for not \\"correcting\\" his leadership methods, developing a personality cult, distorting the \\"Leninist principle of collective leadership\\" his \\"distortions of socialist legality\\" (i.e. using arbitrary arrest and executions) and use other Khrushchev-era criticisms of Stalinism against Kim Il-sung's leadership. Kim Il-sung became aware of the plan upon his return from Moscow and responded by delaying the plenum by almost a month and using the additional time to prepare by bribing and coercing Central Committee members and planning a stage-managed response. When the plenum finally opened on August 30 Choe Chang-ik made a speech attacking Kim Il-sung for concentrating the power of the party and the state in his own hands as well as criticising the party line on industrialisation which ignored widespread starvation among the North Korean people. Yun Kong Hum attacked Kim Il-sung for creating a \\"police regime\\". Kim Il-sung's supporters heckled and berated the speakers rendering them almost inaudible and destroying their ability to persuade members. Kim Il-sung's supporters accused the opposition of being \\"anti-Party\\" and moved to expel Yun from the party. Kim Il-sung, in response, neutralised the attack on him by promising to inaugurate changes and moderate the regime, promises which were never kept. The majority in the committee voted to support Kim Il-sung and also voted in favour of repressing the opposition, expelling Choe and Pak from the Central Committee. Several leaders of the Yunan faction fled to China to escape the purges that followed the August plenum, while supporters of the Soviet faction and Yanan faction were rounded up. Though Kim Tu Bong, the leader of the Yanan faction and nominal President of North Korea, was not directly involved in the attempt on Kim, he was ultimately purged in 1958, accused of being the \\"mastermind\\" of the plot. Kim Tu Bong \\"disappeared\\" after his removal from power, and likely was either executed or died in prison. In September 1956, a joint Soviet- Chinese delegation went to Pyongyang to \\"instruct\\" Kim Il-sung to cease any purge and reinstate the leaders of the Yanan and Soviet factions. A second plenum of the Central Committee, held on September 23, 1956, officially pardoned the leaders of the August opposition attempt and rehabilitated them, but in 1957 the purges resumed, and, by 1958, the Yanan faction had ceased to exist. Members of the Soviet faction, meanwhile, facing increased harassment, decided to return to the Soviet Union in increasing numbers. By 1961, the only faction left was Kim Il-sung's own guerrilla faction, along with members who had joined the WPK under Kim Il-sung's leadership and were loyal to him. In the 1961 Central Committee, there were only two members of the Soviet faction, three members of the Yanan faction and three members of the Domestic faction left out of a total Central Committee membership of 68. These individuals were personally loyal to Kim Il-sung and were trusted by him; however, by the late 1960s, even these individuals were almost all purged. One likely reason for the failure of the Soviet and Yanan factions to depose Kim Il-sung was the nationalist view by younger members of the party who had joined since 1950 that the members of these factions were \\"foreigners\\" influenced by alien powers while Kim Il-sung was seen as a true Korean. According to Kim Il-sung‚Äôs biographer, Dae sook suh: \\"His (Kim‚Äôs) long struggle to consolidate power was complete... There were no longer any factions to challenge his position, and, for the first time, no foreign armed forces were occupying the North\\".Suh, Kim Il-Sung The Sino-Soviet Split Until the 1960s, the regime in the DPRK was seen as an orthodox Communist one-party state, with power residing in the Communist Party. All industry was nationalised and all agriculture was collectivised on the Soviet model, and the party controlled this command economy at every level. All other political organisation was suppressed and civil society was extinguished. A pervasive political police apparatus suppressed all dissent. Even at this stage, there was a personality cult of Kim Il-sung, but it was usually assumed in the West that the DPRK was a Soviet satellite like Poland or East Germany though, in reality, this had stopped being the case after 1956. The Sino-Soviet split helped Kim Il-sung take the Workers' Party of Korea on an independent path between Moscow and Beijing. The party and Kim Il-sung in particular were wary of de-stalinization and of Khrushchev's reforms. In the late 1950s, the DPRK began to increasingly emulate the People's Republic of China (PRC), launching its own version of the Great Leap Forward calling it the Chollima movement. The press did not mention the Sino-Soviet split at first. In 1961, Kim Il-sung signed a treaty of friendship and mutual cooperation with Zhou Enlai and then proceeded to sign a similar treaty with the Soviet Union. After 1962 and particularly after the Twenty-Second CPSU Party Congress in which Soviet leaders criticised Chinese leaders, the WPK began to side openly with the PRC not only on issues such as the personality cult and anti-revisionism but also against Khrushchev's theory of peaceful coexistence. Editorials began to appear in the press openly criticising the Soviet position and defending the Chinese and obliquely attacking Khrushchev. The WPK supported the PRC during its conflict with India in 1962 and denounced the USSR's \\"capitulation\\" in the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Soviet Union responded by cutting off all aid to the DPRK, seriously damaging North Korea's industry and military capability. PRC did not have the resources to replace the Soviet aid and, after 1965, was embroiled in the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. Events in PRC shocked the WPK leadership and caused it to distance itself from PRC and criticise Mao's \\"dogmatism\\" and recklessness, even accusing the Chinese of adopting the \\"Trotskyist theory of permanent revolution\\", a serious heresy in the Communist world. The Chinese Red Guards began to attack Kim Il-sung and Korean domestic and foreign policy. After 1965, North Korea took a neutral stand in the Sino-Soviet conflict, backing away from its previous uncritical support of PRC. Although Kim Il- sung's regime emulated some of the slogans of the Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution, Kim Il-sung remained wary of Chinese domination and never applied anything like the Cultural Revolution in North Korea. In the same year, DPRK forces captured the U.S.S. Pueblo, an American spy ship, showing that Kim Il- sung was running his own version of the Cold War, independent of Soviet or Chinese tutelage. Juche and Kim Il-sung as supreme leader Party headquarters in Kim Il-sung Square, Pyongyang After 1956, Kim Il-sung was no longer a Soviet puppet and the DPRK moved away from being a Soviet satellite or \\"people's democracy\\". Nor did he trust the Chinese due to their suspected support of the Yanan faction's move against Kim Il-sung. Rather, he pursued an independent policy and initiated his Juche program of national self-reliance in order to diminish the influence of the USSR and China over domestic North Korean affairs. The program was officially launched in June 1966 (after the state visit of the Soviet Foreign Minister) as the program of national self- determination and Communist and Workers' Parties' non-interference. By the late 1960s, the North Korean media was hailing the Juche ideology as being superior to Leninism and other foreign ideologies and \\"burning loyalty\\" to the \\"Great Leader\\" became a major ideological theme (the term \\"Great Leader\\" was first used in the early 1960s) and took the Stalinistic practice of the personality cult to new levels. With the removal of the other factions, Kim Il-sung became the supreme leader of the DPRK. By 1960, Kim Il-sung had purged virtually all the members of the Yanan, Domestic, and Soviet factions through show trials, intimidation, and encouraging Soviet Koreans to return to the USSR, leaving the party to be dominated by his \\"guerrilla comrades\\" as well as young technocrats who had joined the party after its founding and were loyal to Kim Il-sung. In 1972, the DPRK adopted a new constitution, under which an executive presidency was created, and Kim Il-sung became President as well as the WPK's General Secretary. Thereafter, Kim Il-sung's personality cult reached heights that made even Stalin and Mao appear modest by comparison. Kim Il-sung was credited with personal direction of every supposed achievement of the regime, his biography was rewritten to make him the founder and leader of the WPK from its inception, and a new ideology of Kim Il-sung's creation, Juche or self-reliance, replaced Marxism‚ÄìLeninism as the regime's official ideology. All other WPK leaders remained completely anonymous, although Kim Il-sung's power in fact depended on the control of the Korean People's Army and the security forces by his loyal agent, Defence Minister Oh Jin-wu. Kim Jong-il explains in Socialism of Our Country is Socialism of Our Style as the Embodiment of the Juche Idea, a speech made to the central committee of the WPK on December 27, 1990, the divorce with Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. \\"We could not literally accept the Marxist theory which had been advanced on the premises of the socio-historic conditions of the developed European capitalist countries, or the Leninist theory presented in the situation of Russia where capitalism was developed to the second grade. We had had to find a solution to every problem arising in the revolution ... from the standpoint of Juche\\". The practical effect of Juche was to seal the DPRK off from virtually all foreign trade, except to a limited extent with China and the Soviet Union. But, the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping in China after 1978 meant that trade with the undeveloped centrally-planned economy of the DPRK held decreasing interest for China, while the fall of communism in the Soviet Union in 1991 completed the DPRK's isolation. This, added to the continuing high level of expenditure on armaments, led to a steadily mounting economic crisis from the 1980s onwards. The rise of Kim Jong-il Kim Jong-il had been groomed to become his father's successor for a long time. In 1964, he was appointed Central Committee member, then promoted to Politburo member and designated successor to Kim Il-sung in 1974 by a Central Committee plenum. After Kim Jong-il assumed the position of party secretary in charge of organization and propaganda in September 1973, his involvement in party affairs enhanced their organizational strength and discipline. With his elevated position in the party, Kim Jong-il rigidly implemented two policies: an enhancement of the role of full-time party cadres in local and administrative units and a strengthening of party-life criticism in every unit of the workplace as well as in the party. This establishment of a strong disciplinary tradition in the party contributed to the maintenance of social control. It has become an important foundation for the persistence of the existing authority structure centered on the father and the son.Byoung-Lo Philo Kim, Two Koreas in Development: A comparative study of Principles and strategies of Capitalist and Communist Third World Development, pp.120-130 In 1980, the WPK Congress elevated Kim Jong-il to senior positions and publicized his status as heir apparent. Until then, it seemed likely that Kim's successor would be either Oh Jin-wu or Prime Minister Kim Il (not related to Kim Il-sung). In fact, it seems that Kim Il-sung had always planned that his son would succeed him, and had been advancing him within the Army (the real source of power in the DPRK) since 1974. Kim Il was removed from office in 1976 and died in 1984, and Oh remained loyal to the Kim family. Well before Kim Il-sung's death in 1994, Kim Jong-il had become the day-to-day ruler of the country, and had promoted his own followers to key positions in the Army. Kim Jong-il's accession was followed by a round of purges in the WPK, in which some of his father's old followers were removed from office. =The 6th Party Congress and the party's decline= WPK congresses and plenums became less and less frequent, and their deliberations less and less substantive. Part of the reason for the ‚Äúsubservience‚Äù of the delegates appears to be the significant turnover between congresses: between 41 and 72 percent of the members of Central Committees selected at each party congress were new to their positions.Adrian Buzo, The Guerilla Dynasty: Politics and Leadership in North Korea, Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1999, p.31, Table 2.1 Despite the almighty status and power of the WPK, it has never functioned according to regulations, a fact that became even worse after Kim Il-Sung's death. A party congress has not been held since the sixth party congress in 1980. According to the Party Rules, a party congress is supposed to be held every five years. The plenum of the Central Committee has not been held since the 21st Plenum in December 1993. The plenum, which has the right to elect the General Secretary, was not held even when Kim Jong-il became the party's general secretary in October 1997. Instead Kim Jong-il was endorsed by both the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission on ground of petitions and letters from lower organizations. For the first time in the history of Workers' Party of Korea, a plenum also was not held before the first session of newly elected SPAs. It is also suspected that Secretariat has not held a meeting since Kim Il-sung's death, while the last known Politburo meeting before 2010 was held in 1994. In the wake of the revision of the constitution in 1998, making the National Defense Commission the highest state body, there had been a dramatic reshuffling of the official leadership rankings. The elevation of the NDC to preeminent status placed Kim‚Äôs unique stamp on the North Korean regime through the creation of a quasi-wartime crisis management system. = 2007‚Äì2010 = The Party was given new prominence starting from 2007‚Äì2008: in 2007, the Administration Department was re-established with Chang Song-taek as director, and in 2009 Choe Yong-rim was appointed chief secretary of the Pyongyang Party Committee filling a 9-year vacancy. In 2009, South Korea‚Äôs government released the latest constitution of North Korea which codified the prevailing ideology of party and government. It omitted all mention of communism. A press representative also explained to South Korean officials that communism is not considered viable \\"as long as U.S. imperialism exists\\".Brian R. Myers: ‚ÄúThe Constitution of Kim Jong Il.‚Äù Wall Street Journal. 1 October 2009. (Accessed 20 December 2012) =The 2010 Party Conference= On 26 June 2010, the Party Politburo called the 3rd Party Conference for early September; after an unexplained delay, the Conference was held on 28 September; it re-elected Kim Jong-il as Party General Secretary, renewed the Party Central Committee with Kim Jong-il's son Kim Jong-un as member, and adopted new Party Rules which eliminated the clause that a party congress must be convened every 5 years, increased the power of the Central Military Commission, and inserted a praise to Kim Jong-il in the preface.Ken E. Gause, North Korea Under Kim Chong-il. Power, Politics and Prospects for Change. August 2010 Pyongyang propaganda proclaims \\"Greet the conference of the Workers' Party of Korea as an auspicious event which will shine forever in the history of our party and country!\\" On 28 September 2010, a Central Committee plenum (the first after 17 years) was held as well, renewing central authorities and appointing Kim Jong- un a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission. On 6 June 2011, North Korean press publicized a Politburo enlarged meeting, the first of this kind since the 1980s. The meeting was almost entirely focused on Kim Jong-il's recent visit to the People's Republic of China, adding further speculation on China's endorsement of Kim Jong-il's succession as well as signalling the DPRK's increasing interest for Chinese economic reforms. =The rise of Kim Jong-un= After Kim Jong-il died on 17 December 2011, North Korean elites moved to consolidate Kim Jong-un's position. He was declared to be in charge of the country as soon as the official report on Kim Jong-il's death was published on 19 December. On 26 December 2011, the official newspaper Rodong Sinmun hailed him as supreme leader of the party and the state. On 30 December, a meeting of the Politburo officially appointed him Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, after he was allegedly nominated for the position by Kim Jong-il himself in October 2011 (the anniversary of Kim Jong-il's assumption of general-secretaryship). Despite being not even a Politburo member, Kim Jong-un was nevertheless proclaimed to the unofficial position of supreme leader of the Workers' Party of Korea. Key posts as general secretary, chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Chairman of the National Defence Commission, as well as two seats in the five-member Politburo Presidium, remained vacant. After celebrations for Kim Jong-il's 70th anniversary (during which he was elevated to the rank of Taewonsu, usually translated as Grand Marshal or Generalissimo), on 18 February the Politburo announced the convening of the 4th Party Conference for mid-April 2012 (near the 100th birth anniversary of Kim Il-sung) \\"to glorify the sacred revolutionary life and feats of Kim Jong Il for all ages and accomplish the Juche cause, the Songun revolutionary cause, rallied close around Kim Jong Un.\\"DPRK's ruling party to convene conference in April Participants in the provincial party conferences endorsed the election of Kim Jong-un as a delegate to the 4th Party Conference. According to KCNA, provincial party conferences were held in Jagang, South Hwanghae, North Pyongan, and Kangwon and a city party conference was held in Rason (Rajin-Sonbong is one of three province-level cities). On 26 March 2012, Kim was elected a delegate to the 4th Party Conference by the party organization of the Korean People‚Äôs Army. At the 4th Party Conference on 11 April, Kim Jong-il was declared to be the Eternal General Secretary and Kim Jong-un was elected to the newly created post of First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, as well as Politburo Presidium member. The Conference also proclaimed Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism \\"as the only guiding idea of the party\\".4th Party Conference of WPK Held, Rodong Sinmun, 12 April 2012.

Afterwards at a rest camp, they meet again, fall in love, and are secretly married. Plot After the United States enters World War I in 1917, Wyoming native Jim Baker (Gary Cooper) and his fellow engineer Jersey (Regis Toomey) join the Army and are sent to France with the Engineer Corps. On the battlefield, Baker rescues Patricia Hunter (June Collyer), an American society girl who wanders onto the battlefield. Having worked for the Ambulance Corps, Hunter went AWOL to escape the boredom of her job. After rescuing her from enemy fire, Baker reprimands her for her actions. Later at a rest camp, Baker and Hunter see much of each other, fall in love, and are secretly married. Sometime later, Jim is sent back to the front. When Hunter reads about Baker's death, she opens a family chateau to entertain servicemen and try to forget the man she loves. When Jim arrives at the chateau, having only been wounded, he sees her apparent gaity and misunderstands her feelings. When he encourages her to return with him to Wyoming, she refuses, and he decides to return to the front. On Armistice Day, Baker finds her waiting for him in the town where they were married.

After farming in Alabama, he started work in Dallas, Texas as a bookkeeper for Brunswick Records, until that company was taken over by the American Record Corporation in 1931. He worked closely with ARC executive Art Satherley (who had also been born in England), and increasingly worked in A&R;, discovering new talent to record. In 1936, a regional talent scout, Ernie Oertle, introduced Law and Satherley to blues musician Robert Johnson. Law recorded Johnson in San Antonio and Dallas in 1936 and 1937, at the only two sessions that the musician ever recorded. The following year, 1938, Law recorded country musician Bob Wills on the song \\"San Antonio Rose\\", which became his signature song.

However, he soon returned to country music, and in 1945 took charge of all Columbia's recordings east of Texas, with Satherley taking responsibility for those to the west. After Satherley's retirement in 1952, Law took over national responsibility for Columbia's country music division, initially recording mainly at Jim Beck's studio in Dallas. He recruited singers Carl Smith, Lefty Frizzell, Little Jimmy Dickens, Johnny Horton, Marty Robbins and Johnny Cash, to the label, and, after Beck's death in 1956, recorded mainly at Owen Bradley's Quonset Hut Studio in Nashville, which later became Columbia's Studio B. Law's productions in the late 1950s and early 1960s included Johnny Horton's \\"The Battle of New Orleans\\", Marty Robbins' \\"El Paso\\", and Jimmy Dean's \\"Big Bad John\\", all of which topped the US pop chart and helped bring country music to a wider audience.\\"Don Law Dies At Age 80: Key Nashville Executive\\", Billboard, 8 January 1983, p. 82 Frank Hoffmann (ed.), Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound, Routledge, 2004, p. 1191 He also produced most of Johnny Cash's recordings during the period.

The first two series of the show aired on BBC Three in 2012 and 2014, featuring Paul McCaffrey, Joel Dommett, Marek Larwood, and Roisin Conaty. In April 2015, Channel 5 and Comedy Central announced a new series starring Lee Griffiths, Matt Ralph, Paul Biggin, and David Moon, replacing the previous four comedians. Matt Edmondson is the narrator. Format Before every challenge, the guys explain where they are, what the challenge is, and what will happen if they fail. There is a mic placed on the cast member performing the prank. There are also hidden cameras near the area to capture the action. The location in which the challenge takes place is usually a public area such as a park, shopping centre, or store. The criteria of each challenge are the same for each of the jokers competing in the round. If the joker cannot complete their task, they get a Thumbs-Down. At the end of the episode, the joker(s) with the most thumbs down is punished, and the punishments are usually more embarrassing, humiliating, disgusting, painful or scary than any of the challenges. Punishments cannot be refused, or the joker will be kicked off the show. Episodes Before every challenge, there is a hidden camera and mic placed on the cast-member performing the prank.

The company's products are produced at two manufacturing plants Koloss in Moscow region, and Detchinsky Vegetable Concentrates Factory (DZOK) in Kaluga region. Russky Produ—Åt produces oat flakes, instant porridges, soups, instant soups, coffee beans, instant coffee, instant chicory, cereal drinks, kissels, spices, seasonings, jelly, and baking mixes. The company‚Äôs brand portfolio includes Hercules (), Supersoup (), Grocery 101 (), Datchniy Soup (), Bake at Home (), Tradition (), Coffitel (), Old Mill (), Mr Slivkin (), and Russky Product (). The company‚Äôs products are sold in more than 70,000 retail outlets between Brest and Vladivostok as well as exported to the Commonwealth of Independent States, Central Asia, Israel, United States, Canada, and the EU.  History  Russky Product was created through the merger of five food manufacturers in 1996 whose various histories start with the N. G. Grigoreva sausages and gastronomic meat products factory established in 1861 followed by the Moscow Food Factory in the 1920s. The Moscow Food Factory became the first soviet company to master the industrial production of food concentrates in 1932. In 1936, special recipes were created for Papanin‚Äôs 1937 nine-month expedition to the extreme north aboard North Pole-1. In 1940 the factory was awarded the Order of Lenin after increasing its production 13-fold to 47,000 tons. By the height of the Great Patriotic War (World War II), production had increased to 80,500 tons in 1942. In the post-war years the Moscow Food Factory introduced oat flakes brand Hercules that is well- known today as well as becoming the first factory first to produce infant formula and baking mixes on an industrial scale. The Detchinsky Vegetable Concentrates Factory (DZOK) was built in 1950 subsequently producing dried potatoes, carrots, onions, greens, bulk concentrates, jellies, cottage cheese, dried berries and fruits, and freeze dried meats. The pasta factory ¬´Supermak¬ª was built in 1959, and the Moscow experimental plant food concentrates factory ¬´Koloss¬ª in 1962. ¬´Koloss¬ª became the first plant in the Soviet Union to industrially produce potato chips.  Products  The company operates in most segments including cereals, soup, instant soup, potato chips, noodles, kissel, kompot, coffee, instant chicory, barley beverages, jelly, spices and seasoning, baking mixes.  Major competitors  Russky Produkt's largest competitors are international corporations Nestle, Kraft Foods, Unilever and Mars Incorporated. International Competitors comprise approximately 65% of the Russian Market.  Financial problems  The company faced financial problems in early 2014. After selling its famous Bodrost () tea brand in the 2nd half of 2014 for an undisclosed amount, the company invested the proceeds to improve business efficiency via enhancement of production capacity, introduction of state-of-the art equipment and product portfolio optimisation. The company reports that 2018 resulted in a record year for volumes both in tons and rubles.

Camillo Tarello, title plate, 1567. Camillo Tarello (ca. 1513 - 1573) was a Venetian agronomist, known as author of Ricordo d'agricoltura di M. Camillo Tarello,Camillo Tarello. Ricordo d'agricoltura di M. Camillo Tarello 1567/1773 (google books) and for his patent of a new system in agriculturePopular Science, Nov. 1908, p. 407 based on crop rotation granted by the Venetian Senate in 1566.Luca Mol√† (2003) The Silk Industry of Renaissance Venice.  Life and work  Camillo Tarello, a native of Lonato del Garda, in the Venetian territories, concerned to see the neglected and dreadful mismanaged state of husbandry, in his country wrote his small, but highly valuable treatise of Agriculture, and presented it to the Senate of Venice under the title of Ricordo es Agricultura. The Senate, in justice to the excellency of this work and the patriotic intentions of its author, granted him, on 29 September 1566, not only the sole right of vending his book, but also ordered at the fame time that all such as adopted his new method of husbandry, should pay to him, and afterwards to his descendants, four marchetti (about three halfpence of the 18th century) for every acre of corn land, and two marchetti for every acre of other land, planted according to his direction.The Complete Farmer Or a General Dictionary of Husbandry. 4th ed. London, T. Longman 1793. p. PLO Tarello and another agronomist from Brescia, Agostino Gallo, promoted the use of clover as a fodder.Thorkild Kj'rgaard (2006) The Danish Revolution, 1500-1800: An Ecohistorical Interpretation. p. 68 In Ricordo d'agricoltura he explained: :\\"Clover is an excellent fodder, not just as Pliny says, but as experience shows. Its roots benefit the soil by making it rich no less than grass benefits animals by nourishing them. That is why people from Brescia sow clover where they later intend to grow flax, which exhausts the soil a great deal... If one wishes to sow this crop, one should initially buy the seed in Brescia or some other place where it is to be found.\\"Translation in Thorkild Kj'rgaard (2006, p. 68) In the antiquity clover had been of secondary importance as manner. Its domestication had been described by Albertus Magnus in De vegitabilibus, around 1270, but the campaign of Gallo and Tarello around 1550 made it popular.  Reception  Tarello's work became an import reference in early modern theory on agriculture. Early 19th century Albrecht Thaer for example notified, that in the country Mecklenburg there seemed to be entirely ignorant of the method pointed out by Camillo Tarello, namely, that of not burying the dung until the last sowing, or of even spreading it over the new turf; in fact, the adoption of this plan, according to which the manure is only applied to the soil as a kind of capital, is perhaps considered to produce too great a diminution in the corn harvests, although the loss in that point will, in the end, be thoroughly compensated by the increased richness of the pasturage, and by the abundance of the produce which will be obtained when the ground is cultivated again.Albrecht Thaer The Principles of Agriculture, Volume 1. Translated by William Shaw, 1844. p. 212-3 Thaer further explained: :Latterly, the practice of sowing white clover with the last crop has become very general: only a few apathetic and indolent agriculturists, or men who are firmly wedded to old opinions and customs, neglect this practice, and consider natural herbage to be quite as efficient and beneficial for the nourishment of cattle; but cow-keepers and dairy farmers are, almost invariably, great advocates of this practice, and their opinion ought to possess some weight. :It makes a very great difference in the pasturage of the first year, and the effects are even sometimes perceptible on that of the second and third. The produce of the pasturage ought to be valued both according to the nature of the sou and the greater or less disposition which it shows towards the bearing of grass, as well as according to the period which has elapsed since it has been without cultivation. And according to Thaer (1844), the testimony of a great many aged persons goes to prove that a wide extent of land, which had been wholly exhausted by the triennial rotation, has become so much ameliorated by this system of cultivation in the course of one generation, that it is now capable of producing a considerable surplus of corn for exportation, besides affording an abundant pasturage to three times as many cattle as were formerly fed upon it.

Calling the Roll After An Engagement, Crimea, better known as The Roll Call, is an 1874 oil-on-canvas painting by Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler. It became one of the most celebrated British paintings of the 19th century, but later fell out of critical favour. The painting depicts a roll call of soldiers from the Grenadier Guards during the Crimean War. It was taken to depict an occasion following the Battle of Inkerman in 1854, but was intended to show a more generic scene from the war. An irregular line of private soldiers stand in the snow wearing their greatcoats and bearskins, many clearly exhausted or wounded. One of the privates has slumped forward onto the icy ground. An officer on horseback watches while a sergeant marks his muster roll. The painting has a highly finished surface, reflecting Thompson's academic training, but she eschewed the traditional pyramidal composition of history paintings focusing on one prominent individual, such as Benjamin West's The Death of General Wolfe or John Singleton Copley's The Death of Major Pierson, in favour of a more democratic linear arrangement, emphasising the common soldier. The coldness of the winter is evoked by the dominant tones of black, grey, white and brown, contrasting with small splashes of red from coatees and flags. It measures . History After having read parts of Alexander William Kinglake's Invasion of the Crimea, Thompson painted studies of Crimean veterans in 1873 before working on the larger painting. Thompson - then 26 years old and almost unknown - submitted the painting to the Royal Academy for exhibition at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1874. The work was received very favourably: the selection committee applauded when it was unveiled and Butler received a standing ovation from fellow artists on varnishing day. The painting became very popular when it went on show at eye level in the prestigious Gallery Two, Butler wrote that she awoke and \\"found myself famous\\". A policeman was detailed to stand by a railing to keep the crowds back (only the third time this step had been necessary, after David Wilkie's The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch in 1822 and William Powell Frith's The Derby Day in 1858). Butler's painting was also singled out by Prince Albert in his speech at the Academy Banquet. The painting toured the country, attracting large crowds. Artist William Holman Hunt noted in his book Pre-Raphaelitism that \\"it touched the nation's heart as few pictures have ever done\\". The work had been commissioned for ¬£100 by a Manchester industrialist Charles Galloway. However, Queen Victoria insisted that she should buy it, and the work remains in the Royal Collection. Lady Butler developed a reputation for her military pictures after the favourable reception of this painting. It was followed by a series of military paintings, Quatre Bras in 1875, and then two more Crimean paintings, Balaclava and Inkermann, exhibited at the Fine Art Society in 1876 and 1877. These were followed in 1879 by Remnants of an Army and in 1881 her most famous work, Scotland Forever!. In 1879, Butler came within two votes of becoming the first woman to be elected as an Associate Member of the Royal Academy (apart from two founder Members, Mary Moser and Angelica Kauffman; ultimately, the first female Associate Member was Annie Swynnerton, elected in 1922, and the first full Member was Laura Knight in 1936).

ASN-205 ASN-205 is a fixed wing UAV that first appeared on September 6, 2009, during the practice parade of the 60th anniversary of parade on October 1, 2009. ASN-205 is intended as the successor of earlier ASN-104/105 series, and is intended mainly to perform missions of drones, while the other UAV, ASN-206, is intended for reconnaissance missions.ASN-205 ASN-206 ASN-206 is a fixed wing UAV in twin boom layout with high wing configuration with twin-tail. Propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven engine mounted at the rear end of the fuselage. ASN-206 was reportedly developed under the assistance of Tadiran Spectralink Ltd, an Israeli company specialising in the airborne communications and electronic countermeasures (ECM) systems, but this cannot be confirmed. Though classified by Chinese as a light weight UAV, ASN-206 actually weighs more than 200 kg, and this was mainly caused by the technological bottleneck and limitation of industrial capability China faced back in the early 1990s. In 1996, ASN-206 won State Science and Technology Prizes.

JWP01 is no longer in production and is in the process of being replaced by its successor JWP02, but some still remain in service. JWP01 is an ASN-206 specially adopted for artillery observation, with an electro-optical sensor payload mounted under the nose. ASN-207 ASN-207 is a development of ASN-206 and share the identical design layout. ASN-207 adopts new engine and material during its design and construction, enables it to increase its endurance and payload by doubling that of original, thanks to the rapid advancement China made in the technological and industrial capability. Range is also significantly increased.ASN-207 *Payload (kg): 100 max *Endurance (hr): 8 ‚Äì 16 *Range (km): 600 WZ-6 WZ-6 is the development of ASN-207 adopted by Chinese military. WZ = Wu Zhen, Êó†‰æ¶ in Chinese, short for Wu-Ren Zhen-Zha-Ji Êó†‰∫∫‰æ¶ÂØüÊú∫ in Chinese, meaning pilotless reconnaissance aircraft. As its designation implies, this UAV is for reconnaissance missions. The most obvious distinction between WZ-6 and the original ASN-207 is the addition of a mushroom shaped radome installed atop of the fuselage, housing the communication antenna.WZ-6 In addition to electro-optical payload, WZ-6 is also capable of carrying miniature radar to carry out reconnaissance missions. JWP02 JWP02 UAV is a derivative of WZ-6 and has already entered service with Chinese military. The most obvious external visual difference between WZ-6 and JWP02 is that the electro-optical turret mounted below the fuselage of WZ-6 is absent on JWP02. The exact function of JWP02 remain unclear because Chinese governmental establishments have not released any detailed information on this UAV other than photos of its deployment by Chinese military. Presumably, it is used in reconnaissance missions. BZK-006 BZK-006 is a further development of WZ-6 adopted by Chinese military, and it is an enlarged WZ-6 with four underwing hardpoints added, two for with wing. BZK-006 is capable of carrying a total of four Chinese UAV employed missiles, and a photo of air-to-surface missile targeting screen has been publicized by Chinese governmental sources when depicting BZK-006 deployed by Chinese military. However, as of 2014, it is not known if BZK-006 carries any air-to-air missiles, so it is purely adopted for ground attack missions. Specification:BZK-006 UAV *Length (m): 4.3 *Height (m): 1.5 *Endurance (hr): 12 DCK-006 DCK-006 is the unarmed reconnaissance version of BZK-006, and it shares the same dimension with BZK-006, and the endurance of DCK-006 is also 12 hours. Due to the addition of mushroom shaped communication antenna radome, the endurance of WZ-6 is significantly reduced due to additional weight. BZK-006 solves this problem by enlarge the airframe of WZ-6, which share the same smaller airframe with ASN-207, and the enlarged airframe enables more fuel to be stored to extend the range and endurance. DCK-006 share the identical enlarged airframe of BZK-006 and thus having similar performance, which is needed for long endurance reconnaissance missions.DCK-006 UAV DCK-006 made its public debut in the parade in Beijing for the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.

It was located on Piedrabuena Bay on the Filchner Ice Shelf. At the time of its inauguration in 1954 it became Argentina's southernmost permanent base. It was shut down in 1980 over safety concerns due to it being built on increasingly unstable ice, which endangered both personnel and equipment. A new, larger replacement base was established further south, and named Belgrano II, followed by Belgrano III, which became the southernmost of the three. History On 18 November 1954 the Antarctic Naval Task Force commanded by then Ship-of-the-Line Captain Alicio E. Ogara sailed from Buenos Aires with the objective of setting up a base on the Filchner Ice Shelf that would serve as a launch point for expeditions to the South Pole. The fleet consisted of ARA Bah√≠a Buen Suceso, ARA Bah√≠a Aguirre, ARA Punta Loyola, ARA Chiriguano, ARA Sanavir√≥n, ARA Yamana and the icebreaker ARA General San Mart√≠n. On 2 January 1955 the expedition sailed up to the southernmost point of the Weddell Sea at 78¬∞ 01' S. At the time it was the highest austral latitude ever reached by boat, and a new world record was set. The task force then sailed north along the ice wall, seeking for an anchoring place. On 3 January then Brigade General Hern√°n Pujato, director of the Argentine Antarctic Institute, flew over the ice shelf area aboard a helicopter to choose a suitable place to mount the base, selecting a small cove where the high wall of ice sloped down to the sea. The unloading of the materials, equipment, tools, instruments and consumables was conducted from ARA General San Mart√≠n. The team built a main house, four quonset huts, food stores and hangar. They left on the new base enough fuel for three years. The expedition commanded by then Colonel Jorge Edgard Leal that on 10 December 1965 reached the South Pole was prepared at Belgrano I and launched from there on 26 October of that year. Belgrano I was shut down after 25 years of continuous service due to the fast deterioration of the ice barrier it was sitting on; new, often hidden cracks and crevices endangered the on-duty personnel and material. The base was closed on January 1980 and all of its staff and equipment were evacuated by helicopters operating from the icebreaker ARA Almirante Ir√≠zar. In order to continue asserting Argentine sovereignty over the area while carrying out the planned scientific activities, and after detailed studies on alternative locations done by the Argentine Army, it was decided to lay the new facilities on solid land on a new base called Belgrano II. The glacier upon which Belgrano I was standing was continuously drifting towards the sea; eventually it would become a tabular iceberg afloat in the Southern Ocean. On 26 January 1988 a helicopter from Almirante Ir√≠zar confirmed that a tabular iceberg about long containing Belgrano I's remains, the Salta Refuge, two beacons, and the abandoned Shackleton (British) and Drushznaya (Soviet) stations, had split from the ice shelf. This time Almirante Ir√≠zar reached 78¬∞ 21' 02\\" S in the Weddell Sea, a new world record. Another helicopter flyby in January 1989 showed that the iceberg had split into several smaller pieces, which made location of the remains unpractical. The iceberg continued drifting through the Southern Ocean, where the base's remains have presumably been lost. Description During winter this desolate region is almost totally devoid of animal life. On summer, seals, petrels, skuas and emperor penguins can occasionally be spotted. The entire landscape is nothing but blinding-white plains. Due to heavy snow precipitations, Belgrano I was almost totally covered by snow and ice. Only the weather balloons launching platform, the aurorae observation tower and multiple chimneys and antennae stuck out on the surface. The base also had a system of tunnels dug up in the ice and further buried by the copious snowing: some of them were more than deep. These passages provided for a safer mean of walking across buildings without getting exposed to the exterior freezing temperatures and whipping winds; they were also used as temporary deposits. =Scientific activities= Being placed in the auroral zone, Belgrano was ideal for studies of the upper atmosphere, characterized by constant magnetic and ionospheric disturbances. In 1970 a new facility was built: the LABEL laboratory (LAboratory BELgrano), dedicated to further study of these phenomena. It was located some from the main house and other dependencies of the base, and it housed valuable scientific instruments for aurora australis observations, This activity ran across the penumbra and total darkness periods, from 15 March to 10 October. A tower equipped with all-sky cameras photographed the whole celestial hemisphere every minute in order to compose a continuous record of aurorae evolution. Behavior of the ionospheric layers was studied through surveys carried out every 15 minutes. Cosmic radiation was measured by riometer and radiosondes. Upon closure of Belgrano I, the LABEL laboratory was moved to Belgrano II along with all its equipment and instruments.

The X-shaped intersection of Adams Street and Dorchester Avenue marks the center of one of Dorchester's busiest commercial districts. The Fields Corner district is distinguished by several landmark buildings, including one of Dorchester's most well-known, One Fields Corner, also known as the Lenane Building or the Liggett Drug Store Building, at 1448-1456 Dorchester Avenue, a triangular building with prominent curved facade dominating the south side of the Adams Street/Dorchester Avenue intersection. On the east side of the intersection is an enormous brick building which houses a U.S. Post Office and is known as the O'Hearn Storage Building, which once housed a music hall and today displays little of its original character as a building designed by noted Dorchester architect Edwin J. Lewis. To the north is the Fields Corner Municipal Building (1874, now housing professional offices), located at 195 Adams Street on the corner of Arcadia Street, and, a short walk up Adams Street, Ronan Park, an 11-acre hilltop park with a gorgeous view to Dorchester Bay. Residential areas such as Meetinghouse Hill, Clam Point, Melville Park surround the Fields Corner business district and are characterized by densely packed three-decker housing or Victorian homes in yards. Residents are a diverse mix of Vietnamese Americans, Hispanic-speaking peoples, and Americans of African descent, and European descent.

The gateway's canals, rivers, and railroads drastically altered the makeup of America's economy, culture, and population distribution. As rail and waterway technology improved, the Northern Gateway became the preeminent trade conduit in the nation. It helped spur the growth of both eastern and western cities. Settlers rapidly began to settle in the burgeoning towns of the many trade points all along the gateway's route. It allowed goods and information to travel at unprecedented rates, which, in turn, completely re-vamped the style and processes of American culture and economics. Overview The Northern Gateway's primary throughway was the Erie Canal, which was completed in 1825. This man-made waterway traversed New York state 364 miles from Albany to Buffalo. In effect, it connected New York City with Lake Erie due to the fact that the Hudson River unites New York City with Albany. Thus, this feat of human engineering opened up trade between the Atlantic Ocean and Midwestern cities like Chicago. The Saint Lawrence River is the other key waterway of the Northern Gateway. It largely defines the US-Canada border in the northeastern section of the continent. It runs from Lake Ontario in northwestern New York through Quebec and Ontario to the Atlantic Ocean, north of Maine. A later development to the infrastructure of the Northern Gateway was the New York Central Railroad, which was finished in 1852. While it took a little more time than the canals to gain considerable freight traffic, it ended up connecting New York City, Boston, Ontario, Quebec, Erie, and Chicago. Economic Significance As time progressed, the Northern Gateway established itself as the foremost trade channel in the United States. Its close rival, the Northeastern Gateway, connected Philadelphia with Pittsburgh. However, it never really challenged the Northern Gateway in terms of volume of freight traffic. While the Northeastern Gateway's trade tonnage did increase during the antebellum period, it rarely carried more than 5% of westward shipments.Walton 2010, p. 147 Even after the state completed the very costly Mainline of the Pennsylvania Public Works in 1834, which was supposed to be the hallmark of the Northeastern Gateway, it only amounted to 5-10% of the Northern Gateway's traffic volume.Walton 2010, p. 155 By the late 1850s, it had surpassed the well-established Southern Gateway in total tonnage of freight shipments, and had become the unparalleled trade thoroughfare in the nation. While the Southern Gateway had prospered since the early 19th century from steamboat transportation and the collision of western rivers at its hub, New Orleans, the Northern Gateway's railroads and access to the Atlantic Ocean propelled it by the increasingly out-of-date Southern Gateway. Western cities primarily sent lumber, grain, and meat eastward, while eastern metropolises dispatched textiles, leather, machinery, and drugs to the budding western conurbations. At first, most of the shipments along this route went westward. However, by 1842, tonnage from western states equaled that from New York.Shaw 1966, p. 262 Shipments going westward from Albany had reached 82,000 tons in 1836, and would more than double from that already high figure by 1852.Shaw 1966, p. 281 Wheat travelling east from the Great Lakes may have seen the greatest jump in commerce. In 1829, 3640 bushels were loaded into canal boats heading for Albany. The addition of agricultural processing in places like Michigan and Wisconsin, along with the greatly enhanced volume of total trade on the Northern Gateway, allowed this number to exceed 1 million bushels in 1841.Shaw 1966, p. 268 As western farmers prospered from this incredible boom in staple sales, they also began demanding more goods from the east. As a result of their newfound wealth, 78 million pounds of merchandise would end up arriving at one of the Great Lakes key ports for sale to the western population.Shaw 1966, p. 269 The Northern Gateway would play a central role in boosting eastward outbound shipments from 65,000 tons in 1810 to 4.7 million tons in 1860. Prices The Northern Gateway afforded quicker and more extensive access to markets hundreds of miles away. As a result, price differences in various territories decreased, and the formation of monopolies was inhibited. This occurred because people could no longer profit on the notion that consumers only had access to local markets. Furthermore, the ease or access to distant producers allowed regions to focus on their comparative advantage. Eastern cities could focus on textiles and not have to grow their own grain. This allowed greater profits for both the manufacturing-minded east and the farm-minded west. The decreased transportation costs and travel time also decreased the price of many consumer goods and thus increased the population's real wealth. Population Distribution and Growth 1853 Map of New York canals emboldened, center: the Erie Canal, other lines: railroads, rivers and county borders As the Northern Gateway increased the size and profits of previously untapped western markets, people began flooding westward along the gateway's routes in search of similar windfalls. The population density of the area along the western section of the Erie Canal increased five-fold between 1817 and 1835.Shaw 1966, p. 263 As capital was consistently being allocated westward, new cities shot up between New York City and Lake Erie. Rochester's population increased almost 25 times between 1820 and 1850, Syracuse saw a 13-fold enhancement, and Buffalo's population grew by about 21 times its original size during the same time period. Foreign immigrants contributed substantially to the increased population of western cities. For example, between 1840 arid 1845, 300,000 immigrants landed in New York City. However the population only increased by 80,000, which means that the majority of immigrants travelled up the Hudson River to Albany or westward along the Erie Canal.Shaw 1966, p. 274 The Gateway did not solely spur the growth of western cities. In fact, some might say that New York City was its primary beneficiary. About New York City, 19th Century real estate mogul Samuel B. Ruggles stated, The flourishing growth of this city must be attributed almost entirely to the Erie Canal, which has opened our internal commerce with the West, and poured in upon us a rare, steady, and rapidly.Shaw 1966, p. 283 Similarly, in 1842, the editor of the Albany Argus declared, \\"So long as New York remains at the head of the western trade, it must irresistibly advance in wealth, influence, and population, until she will be known not only as the great city of America, but as the great city of the world.\\".Shaw 1966, p. 284 See also *Erie Canal *Pennsylvania Main Line Notes References *Goodrich, Carter, Canals and American Economic Development.

Barbara Walters initially voiced criticism of Wahl, saying she should not be treated like a hero, but Walters has since recanted and praised Wahl's efforts. Politico published Wahl's tell-all firsthand story where she detailed her early career, how she was recruited to RT, her frustrations working for the Russian-funded network. Wahl's contact, James Kirchick, admitted to having foreknowledge of her resignation but denied suggestions that he had orchestrated the event, stating that Wahl did what she did out of her own volition and that she initially reached out to him months earlier following his own on-air protest on the network against anti-gay legislation in Russia. Wahl told David Weigel writing for Slate that her detractors were behaving as though her contact with Kirchick was part of a conspiracy.

The sculpture, which depicts Mary, is located at St. Mary of the Assumption Catholic Church in Decatur, Indiana in the United States. Description The sculpture depicts Mary during her assumption into heaven. She is standing straight upwards, with her chest tilted to the proper left. Her arms are extended, with her proper left arm pointed downward diagonal and her proper right arm pointing upwards diagonal. Her eyes are closed and her head is slightly tilted forward. Mary is shown to wear a blue, white, and light blue robe, which falls all the way to the ground, covering her feet and most of her arms. Three angels are hidden in the robe. Her head is covered by the top of the robe, which has a marbled pale orange-green color. She wears a white shawl, which is draped over both arms and falls almost to the ground. She has white skin and gold speckling is seen throughout the piece. There are three long-stem roses made of metal laying on the ground in front of her. They are affixed to a piece of metal. Originally, the piece was going to be made of cement. The artists changed their minds in order to experiment, and the sculpture was made of scagliola with steel reinforcement. The artists chose to use scagliola to give the sculpture an appearance of being made of marble. The sculpture stands bolted to a covered platform structure, which was completed within four days, and is made of steel with a rubber roof. The sculpture, in total, weighs 700 pounds. Acquisition The piece was commissioned, in June 2012, by the St. Mary of the Assumption Catholic Church's Mary's Garden committee, who were in charge of developing a new garden on the church grounds. They asked Gregory Mendez to create it, and he invited Neil Wiffill, whom he had worked with before, to collaborate. The Blessed Mother was completed at Wiffill's studio, 20 miles away, and moved to the church. The sculpture was dedicated on September 8, 2013, the birthday of Mary. It is located in the Mary Garden at the church. Other information Gregory Mendez and Neil Wiffill worked together to create the piece. The piece took almost one year to complete. They worked 14-hour days during the last four months before finalizing the piece, in order to make the dedication date. They created seven models before deciding on the final version. The artists debated how to depict Mary, either as a modern-day woman or in more traditional clothing. They also discussed extensively on how her body would be positions. In the end piece, the artists aimed to depict a \\"alive and real\\" person through the sculpture. She is described as \\"shapely and modern in appearance,\\" by the artists. The platform, that the sculpture is affixed to, was created by Elton Bishop. It is described as a \\"modern-day grotto\\". The three long-stemmed roses, which lie at the sculptures feet, are meant to suggest that visitors can place flowers of their own in Mary's honor. They are also a tribute to the mothers of the artists. The sculpture is the largest collaboration that the two sculptors have created together, to date. Condition Due to the fragility of scagliola, which is rarely used for outdoor sculpture, the sculpture resides on a covered platform. Before installation, the piece was given four coats of sealant for protection.

The three troopers at left are thought to be those referred to in Waltzing Matilda, while the squatter was Bob Macpherson, fourth from rightAfter the 1890 Australian maritime dispute and the 1891 Australian shearers' strike both of which were long, drawn out affairs in which trade unions were defeated, running out of funds, actions by increasingly militant and desperate unions led up to perhaps the most violent shearers' strike, in 1894.A History of Queensland by Raymond Evans, Cambridge University Press, 2007 )Armstrong, Mick Burning the Rodney Particularly due to falling wool prices in London, pastoralists were motivated to cut pay rates and hire non- union labour, which was plentiful due to mass unemployment during the 1890s depression. In May 1894, the Amalgamated Workers Union rose to the defence of the shearers' wages . By October 1894 the Queensland Amalgamated Workers Union conceded defeat and called off the strike in the colony of Queensland. However, the strike continued in New South Wales, where possibly 16,000 workers gathered in strike camps. Police were mobilised against them. The most famous incident during the strike was the burning and sinking of the steamer Rodney, which was transporting non-union labour up the Darling River. When the boat was moored in a swamp above Pooncarie, a few miles above the Moorara shearing shed, unionists boarded, took control, offloaded all passengers, then soaked the hold in kerosene and set it alight. The burning boat drifted away and sank after several hours. In September 1894, on Dagworth Station, north- west of Winton), striking shearers fired their rifles and pistols in the air, setting fire to the woolshed. The owner of the homestead and three policemen gave chase to a man named Samuel Hoffmeister ‚Äì also known as \\"French(y)\\". Rather than be captured, Hoffmeister shot and killed himself at the Combo Waterhole. It has been widely accepted that the lyrics of Waltzing Matilda are based the incident.

Raised in Connecticut, Polachek co- founded the indie pop band Chairlift while studying at the University of Colorado. The duo emerged from the late-2000s Brooklyn music scene with the sleeper hit \\"Bruises\\". During her time in the band, she worked on the solo projects Ramona Lisa and CEP, before embarking on a career under her own name after Chairlift's disbandment in 2017. Her debut studio album, Pang (2019), featured collaborations with producer Danny L Harle and was released to critical acclaim. Polachek has worked extensively with other artists, collaborating with Blood Orange, SBTRKT and Charli XCX, and penning material for Beyonc√© (\\"No Angel\\"), Travis Scott, and Superfruit.  Early life  Polachek was born in Manhattan, New York, on June 20, 1985. Her family relocated to Tokyo, Japan, when she was one to six years old, and later settled in Greenwich, Connecticut, where Polachek started singing choir in the third grade. She was a synth player from a young age as her father gifted her a Yamaha keyboard to dissuade her from being disruptive on the piano. Polachek recounts her early exposure to traditional Japanese songs and anime themes as being influential on her musical education: \\"[Japanese singing] [is] a lot of minor and pentatonic [tonality], with really angular melodies that I think really stuck in my subconscious.\\" She rode horses growing up: \\"I learned a lot about rhythm and about voice from that. Like, you don't always have full control of your instrument. You have to trust it, you have to give it space, you have to know when to push, give it air.\\" As a \\"hyperactive kid\\", her divorced parents would play Enya at each other's houses in order to calm her senses. As a teenager, Polachek began traveling to the city to attend concerts, which were a mix of post-hardcore emo, DIY punk and jazz shows. Mike Patton once personally walked her into a show at Knitting Factory when her fake ID was rejected. She played in a couple of bands in high school and college.  Career  = Chairlift = Polachek founded the band Chairlift with musician Aaron Pfenning after the pair met during her sophomore year at the University of Colorado. They relocated to New York, where Polachek studied art at New York University, and were joined by Patrick Wimberly in early 2007, the year the band released their first EP titled Daylight Savings, followed by their debut album Does You Inspire You. Polachek and Wimberly went on as a duo to write and produce their 2012 full-length record Something alongside producers Dan Carey and Alan Moulder. In addition, she directed the record's music videos, including \\"Amanaemonesia\\", and \\"I Belong in Your Arms\\". In December 2016, Chairlift announced that they would be breaking up, with a final tour in the spring of 2017. =Solo work= Polachek began performing sets under the moniker Ramona Lisa in 2013. The name originates from a former pseudonym Polachek used on Facebook. She announced her debut self-produced album as Ramona Lisa, entitled Arcadia, in February 2014. Polachek described the album as \\"pastoral electronic music\\". Polachek began writing the album during an artistic residency at the Villa Medici in Rome, Italy. In an interview with Pitchfork, she described how her time in Rome inspired the sounds of Arcadia, stating: \\"When I was looking out the window in Rome, I wanted this type of electronic music to feel as organic as what I was seeing. I don't think any of the tools that I'm using are particularly new‚Äîa lot of the MIDI instruments have been around for 15 years‚Äîbut the compositions make them sound less electronic, more mysterious.\\" The record was made entirely on Polachek's laptop without instruments or external microphones, except to capture field recordings of the sounds she heard in her surroundings. She sang vocals directly into her computer's built in microphone, making use of hotel closets, quiet airport gates, and spare dressing rooms during Chairlift's world tour. The album artwork was shot by New York photographer Tim Barber. In January 2017, Polachek released her second solo album, Drawing The Target Around The Arrow, under her initials, CEP. Polachek was scheduled to perform at Moogfest 2018, but she pulled out in December 2017 when the festival advertised a list of female-identifying artists performing that year, despite the festival lineup being predominantly male. She followed up with a statement on Twitter saying \\"This speaks not to the artists or their music, but to the politics of the festival and self-congratulatory PR. To do this without permission from the artists on display is exploitative and unprofessional\\", adding \\"Moogfest, and all other festivals, simply have a responsibility to position inclusivity as normal\\". In June 2019, Polachek released her debut single under her full name titled \\"Door\\". In a press release for the single, Polachek announced that the single was the beginning of a new project, made mostly in collaboration with PC Music member Danny L Harle. Later in July, Polachek released two singles off of the project, titled \\"Ocean of Tears\\" and \\"Parachute\\", and began to detail her then upcoming album Pang which was released on October 18. =Collaborative work= In 2008, Polachek formed Girl Crisis choir with 12 other female singers including members of Au Revoir Simone and Class Actress. The modular group arranged and recorded two covers a year from 2008 to 2013, including songs by Black Sabbath, Nirvana, Leonard Cohen, The Bangles, and Ace of Base. In 2010, she joined Jorge Elbrecht of Brooklyn-based Violens to record a \\"sgin\\" of Justin Bieber's \\"Never Let You Go\\": \\"We went on YouTube to find a video among the highest ranks of hits, and came across 'Never Let You Go'. We went on to make what we call a 'sgin' (anagram of the word 'sing')‚Äîan original song written specifically to synch into someone else's video on mute\\". Caroline shot and directed video for Violens' \\"It Couldn't Be Perceived\\". Polachek and Elbrecht collaborated again in 2014 on two singles, \\"I.V. Aided Dreams (feat. Caroline Polachek)\\" and \\"Full Mental Erase (feat. Caroline Polachek)\\".Listing of the writing, arrangement and performance credits _Caroline Polachek_ has received on Discogs.com, (accessed December 13, 2014). In 2012, she sang with Ice Choir (solo project of Kurt Feldman of The Pains of Being Pure at Heart) on the song \\"Everything Is Spoilt by Use\\" and directed/edited its official video. Caroline contributed vocals to Blood Orange's \\"Chamakay\\" (2013), collaborating with Blood Orange again on \\"Holy Will\\" (2018). In late 2013, Polachek wrote and produced \\"No Angel\\", which was featured on Beyonc√©'s critically acclaimed fifth studio album, Beyonc√©. Thanks to this song, at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, she received a Grammy Award nomination for Album of the Year. Polachek then collaborated with PC Music's Danny L Harle in early 2016 on the single \\"Ashes of Love\\". Polachek collaborated with felicita throughout his album \\"Hej!\\" (PC Music 2018) including an arrangement of the Polish traditional song \\"Byl Sobie Krol\\" (released under the title \\"Marzipan\\"), and with Charli XCX on Pop 2 (2017) on tracks \\"Tears (feat. Caroline Polachek)\\" and \\"Delicious (feat. Tommy Cash)\\". =Other musical projects= In early 2014, Polachek composed and produced instrumental scores for designers Proenza Schouler and Tess Giberson to be featured on runways and promotional videos. In April 2014, Polachek scored a live performance piece by artists India Menuez and Hayden Dunham at SIGNAL gallery in Brooklyn.Press release from the Signal Gallery (NY) on the India Menuez and Hayden Dunham show, (accessed December 10, 2014). In October 2014, Polachek scored \\"HappyOkay\\", a ballet performance video directed by Elena Parasco and produced by House of Makers and Last Hour. The performance was choreographed by Peter Lueng of the Dutch National Ballet, the largest dance company in the Netherlands, and performed by New York City Ballet's Harrison Ball, Joseph Gordon, and Megan LeCrone.

The autism rights movement has argued that autism should be viewed as a type of neurodiversity and treated as a difference rather than a disorder. Although the diagnosis of autism is rising in post-industrial nations, diagnosis rates are much lower in developing nations. =Africa= Diagnosis Autism research conducted in Africa has been infrequent and unrepresentative of all African countries, making the prevalence of autism in Africa difficult to estimate. Prevalence may be underestimated because reported cases are skewed toward more severe, and thus more recognizable, cases of autism. In Africa, an autism diagnosis often co-occurs with epilepsy or intellectual disability. Treatment  Possible reasons for the fact that many reported cases of autism in Africa are nonverbal cases include difficulty finding services even when a diagnosis is given. Educational and behavioral interventions for children with autism are largely unavailable, mental health care facilities are few, and there are too few facilities and personnel trained to work with autistic children in reference to the estimated number of autism cases in Africa. Bakare and Munir found that health care workers had low to average knowledge and awareness of autism spectrum disorder. In particular, psychiatric health care workers recognized symptoms of ASD better than pediatric health care workers, which implies that early recognition and intervention for children with autism in Africa is infrequent. Supernatural explanations of autism can influence treatment seeking by encouraging people to first seek help from spiritualists and traditional healers. Experience  Studies have not elucidated the clinical presentation of autism in African nations. Autism awareness is low, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Bakare and Munir suggest that education for the public and for health care workers is crucial for early diagnosis of ASD so that early intervention can be effective for African children. =Asia= Diagnosis Autism was not recognized until the 1980s in China. The estimated prevalence of autism is 11.8 per 10,000 people while the estimated prevalence of autism spectrum conditions is 26.6 per 10,000 people. In Japan, recent estimates of autism spectrum are as high as 13 per 10,000 people. This suggests that autism is more common in Asia than previously thought. Sun, X., & Allison, C. (2010). A review of the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder in Asia. Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders, 4(2), 156-167. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Clancy Autism Behavior Scale (CABS), Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC), and Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) are frequently used as diagnostic instruments in China. Treatment In 2013, eight South Asian countries adopted a charter at the South Asian Autism Network's first meeting. The nations plan on working with each other's ministries, and SAAN is advocating long-term health care as well as intervention programs for people with autism. Experience In certain areas, diagnosis and treatment of autism may be difficult because of the lack of facilities or physicians capable of autism recognition. Some families must travel for hours or days to reach an area in which diagnostic facilities are available. Stigma is also a salient issue. Families of children with autism in Hong Kong and China may experience stigmatization from others, which can lead to self-stigmatization in cultures where people focus on their social identity rather than their individual identity. This suggests that parents in China and Hong Kong may experience more stress from raising a child with autism than parents in other areas. Support from friends, families, and professionals is critical to enhance the psychological well-being of parents experiencing stigma. Autism may be of particular significance in India because of its characteristic abnormalities in social relationships, which may cause particular concern due to the value of social relatedness and conformity to social norms in India. Developing countries As recently as 1984, researchers questioned whether autism was a universal phenomenon. Some scientists believed that autism was a condition limited to Western and technologically developed nations; however, now there is evidence of increased prevalence of and knowledge about ASD cross- culturally and internationally. Although autism has a biological basis and there are clear criteria for an autism diagnosis, its symptoms may be viewed differently across cultures. These differences may extend to the perception of autism in different cultures and perceptions of the most effective treatment options.  Western countries  = Diagnosis= The median prevalence rate of autism spectrum disorders in Europe is 61.9 per 10,000 people, while the median prevalence estimated in the United States is 65.5 per 10,000. In western nations, children who show developmental problems are referred for evaluation by a pediatrician. Preliminary screening instruments include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), and Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ). Autism spectrum evaluations are typically conducted by professionals who specialize in developmental disorders, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, or neurologists. Diagnostic instruments that assessing clinicians may use include the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, and Childhood Autism Rating Scale, as well as clinical judgment using criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. = Treatment= Behavioral intervention and medications are frequently used to manage the symptoms of autism. Early intervention programs can improve cognitive and language skills in children who have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Behavioral interventions include Applied Behavioral Analysis, Developmental, Individual Difference, Relationship-based (DIR)/Floortime Model, and Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH). There are no medications that have been approved to treat autism spectrum disorder, but some medications may be prescribed off-label to treat symptoms of ASD. Antipsychotic medications may be used to reduce irritability and aggression in children with autism. Stimulant medications are used to treat symptoms of hyperactivity and inattentiveness. Antidepressant medications are occasionally prescribed to reduce the restricted and repetitive behaviors associated with autism. More research is needed to determine if the safety and effectiveness of medications. = Experience = The puzzle pieces in the autism awareness ribbon represent the complexity of autism, as well as the diversity of people with autism. The estimated lifetime cost of caring for an individual with autism as of 2013 is between $1.4 million and $2.4 million, using data from the United Kingdom and the United States. While some of these costs are incurred for diagnosis and treatment costs, the problem is exacerbated by reduced family earnings when a family member may forgo working in order to care for a family member with autism. Challenges Researchers who aim to obtain reliable data about autism around the world are challenged by many factors. Awareness about autism differs from nation to nation. Services for people with autism and their families differs in availability. The behavior of people with autism may differ cross-culturally, and the capacity to do autism research can be impeded because of these differences. A further challenge is that caregivers and professionals must have knowledge that certain symptoms are associated with autism, and they must perceive these symptoms as problematic. In a certain culture, for example, if language delays are not seen as uncommon until a child is four or five, a professional may not see the delay as symptomatic of autism. In some nations, such as South Korea, the stigma surrounding autism is so high that families may avoid getting their child tested for autism even when the child has noticeable developmental delays. Elsabbagh and colleagues (2012) cite multiple challenges for researchers, including lack of funding for research. The 10/90 gap means that only 10 percent of global spending on health goes toward funding for problems that affect the poorest 90 percent of the world. They also discuss the lack of accessibility or availability of autism services, the expensive cost of resources for epidemiological studies, and variation in diagnosis because clinical judgment is often used for diagnosis. Autism research is further complicated by the fact that families often have different perceptions of autism's etiology. Beliefs include the child being a product of witchcraft or parental misdeed or sin. Positive appraisals include parents' beliefs that the child is a blessing to show that the parents are worthy of taking care of such a child. Negative appraisals of what autism means and its etiology can cause increased stress in families of children with autism.  Autistic culture  An autistic culture has emerged, accompanied by a number of movements and events that encourage greater tolerance of those with autism. Prominent movements include the autistic rights movement and neurodiversity movement which seek to promote the idea that autism is a difference rather than a disease which must be cured. Events include World Autism Awareness Day, Autism Sunday, Autistic Pride Day, Autreat, and others. Media influences the public's perception of autistics. Rain Man, a film that won 4 Oscars including Best Picture, depicts an autistic savant who has incredible talents and abilities. While many autistic individuals do not have these special abilities, some have been successful in their fields. =Autism rights movement= The autism rights movement, also known as the autistic culture movement or the neurodiversity movement, is a social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity, viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured. The autism rights movement advocates a variety of goals, including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors;Mission Statement. Autism Acceptance Project. Retrieved on 2008-11-24. therapies that focus on coping skills rather than imitating the behaviors of neurotypical peers;Mission Statement. Aspies for Freedom. Retrieved on 2008-11-24. the creation of social networks and events that allow autistic people to socialize on their own terms;Autism Network International presents Autreat. (2008-05-23) AIN. and the recognition of the autistic community as a minority group. Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome. This perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views: the medical perspective, that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene(s), and fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines. The movement is controversial. A common criticism leveled against autistic activists is that the majority of them are \\"high-functioning\\" or have Asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of \\"low-functioning\\" autistic people.

The conflict began when Northern Mali declared itself independent from the government creating the un-recognized state of Azawad. Both the Islamists and MNLA formed an alliance in combatting the Malian government. An internal conflict sprung up over the imposing of sharia law in the new state and the MNLA distancing itself from the coalition to a democratic state. Islamists gained popularity amongst anti-Tuareg tribes that helped it overthrow MNLA authority in Gao. Both sides clashed repeatedly leading to the Battle of Gao where the MNLA were driven from the North's two main cities, Gao and Timbuktu. The MNLA soon lost all of its strongholds in the North in a matter of months. They went into hiding secretly gaining support and strength. The beginning of 2013 led the start of the French intervention in Mali that ousted the Islamists from the North's cities and brought back Malian authority. The MNLA supported the French and Chadian forces in military operations against Islamists sanctuaries in the mountains. The MNLA recaptured several important towns in the Kidal Region but refused to dis-arm or hand them over to the Malian government. A series of Islamists sponsored terror attacks plagued MNLA forces for siding with the French. Checkpoints and bases were targeted with suicide bombings that targeted MNLA members. A peace deal was reached with the Malian army in June that let the army transverse freely in MNLA occupied zones that were under Malian jurisdiction. Ethnic violence sprung over the murder of a Tuareg Government officers family. The MNLA responded by harassing and murdering Fulani civilians who create a majority of Islamists rebels. The Islamists stepped up their attacks in one such instance massacring 30 Tuareg merchants. The MNLA has since been battling Islamists. Prelude - Conflict Since its Independence in April 2012, the MNLA has been skeptical of Islamist influence over their new state's future and the implementation of sharia law. Various countries including France have denounced the MNLA's cooperation with terror groups and refused to recognize its new status due to various incidents in its fight against the Malian government which included a massacre that killed 93 Malian soldiers allegedly carried out by Islamists. Two main incidents occurred on the streets of Gao that caused confusion when civilians waving the Malian flag were fired upon by MNLA members which was denied by the MNLA itself, blamed on Islamists. Many did not support the new state of Azawad and Tuareg dominance over their land. Islamists popularity and influence grew in numbers eventually outnumbering MNLA defenders in Gao. The city was taken on June 27, over an argument that escalated into a full-scale battle. The MNLA Secretary General Bilal Ag Acherif was wounded in the battle that also killed four colonels. The MNLA's headquarters and any government building was looted along with the Azawad flag being replaced with sharia. Timbuktu was evacuated by the MNLA a day later after an ultimatum to leave. Resistance grew against Islamic rule in MNLA supported towns but never posed a great threat. On 16 November, the MNLA launched an offensive attack to reclaim their former city base of Gao from Islamists. They did not make it far before their army routed and was chased across the Niger border. Nine MNLA members were wounded, including one seriously. Islamists casualties were 13 dead. Four days later the Islamists launched their own offensive against towns with MNLA presence. The town of M√©naka's defenders were capitulated in a two-day siege that killed one MNLA member and seven pro-MNLA selfdefense volunteers including a prominent political leader Alwabegat Ag Salakatou. Its disputed how many Islamists were killed. The MNLA hoped to establish M√©naka as a central base from which to launch counter-attacks. In December, the now displaced MNLA began peace talks with the Malian government and relinquished its previous goal for Independence in favor of self-rule in Northern Mali. Almost half of the MNLA's combatants deserted for better pay in Islamists factions since the declaration of Independence in April 2012. At this time the MNLA controlled no big localities and was only strong in rural desert areas in the North, having been driven off from its proposed state cities in the South. Troop build ups in the MNLA ranks were reportedly preparing for another offensive. At the start of 2013, the MNLA retook its key town of Kidal after it was abandoned by French air-strikes. The Azawad flag was raised in every town they took each one without a fight. Islamists guerrillas operating the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains launched an offensive of their own terrorizing MNLA dominated towns with suicide bombings. The first hit the town of Khalil on 22 February, after an explosion ripped at an MNLA checkpoint killing three members. The second in that week killed seven members at another checkpoint in Kidal. Fighting resumed the next month leading to the Battle of In Arab. Five members were killed in a day long battle with an elite terrorist brigade led by Mokhtar belMokhtar, the Signatories of Blood. In June 2013, the MNLA agreed on a cease-fire with the Malian army allowing them to have authority over MNLA occupied towns, granting autonomy for Tuareg civilians, and dis-arming the MNLA with an exception for self-defense purposes into a political organization. The MNLA also agreed upon taking back its claim for Independence instead for greater autonomy. The peace-deal lasted over three months before both sides claimed it was breached. In November, the Islamists suspected murder of members of a Tuareg Malian army general's family led to an ethnic conflict between MNLA Tuareg and Islamists dominated Fulani. The situation escalated in February 2014, when 30-35 Tuareg merchants were massacred at the hands of Fulani Islamists. Reprisal attacks targeting Fulani Islamists resumed into an armed confrontation that killed a MNLA member.

Since her debut EP album Musical Journey was released in July 2011 by Sony Music Hong Kong, Manting has been called the \\"musical theater princess\\" by the Hong Kong media because of her sweet-heavenly voice and her love for musical theater.  Early life  Manting was born in New York City, New York, and raised on Long Island. Her father is Chinese-Indonesian and her mother, from Fuzhou, Fujian, China . As a young child, Manting had her sights on what she wanted to become. It was either to be the first Asian-woman President of the United States or a singer. The event that changed her life was when Disney released Aladdin. It was the renowned song \\"A Whole New World\\" that made her choose the latter. She would sing the song and watch the movie every day for the entire school year. Manting entered the Metropolitan Opera Children's Choir at the age of 10 and was chosen by then music director, Elena Doria, to be one of the children singing in Puccini's La Boheme and later Khovanshchina, a Russian opera. It was then, Manting realized that she belonged to the stage.  Career Beginnings  Manting released her maiden EP album in July 2011 where she wrote music and lyrics to her song \\"A Boy\\". She also wrote the lyrics to the song \\"Our Time is Now\\" and \\"Feelings on Fire\\", which was featured in Barbara Wong's movie the Break Up Club (Fiona Sit and Jaycee Chan). C Kwan from Ëæ≤Â§´ aka FAMA wrote \\"One Way Ticket\\" for Manting, which depicts her own story - buying a one way ticket to Hong Kong and creating a life there. Hanjin Tan Èô≥Â•ê‰ªÅ helped with the music for \\"Good to be a Girl\\".  Music Influences  Manting's main influences are Celine Dion, Teresa Teng ÈÑßÈ∫óÂêõ, Han Hung ÈüìÁ¥Ö, and Luther Vandross. Musical Theater and Disney are her favorite genres, however, she is also very fond of Classical, AsianPop, Celtic, Enka, and Fado. She is able to sing in multiple languages including Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Italian, Spanish, and English.

Originally located in the old Bible House on Fourth Avenue‚Äôs famed ‚ÄúBook Row,‚Äù it moved to 114 East 59th Street in the 1930s and then moved next door to its current address in 1964 when the previous building was replaced with a skyscraper. Cohen‚Äôs wife, Ruth Shevin, managed the store‚Äôs art gallery into her 90s\\"A shrine to books past clings to independence\\" The New York Times (October 13, 1997) and worked with several other family members over the years. Now in its third generation of family ownership, the store is operated by Cohen‚Äôs three daughters and a grandson. Since its inception, the Argosy has worked with many prominent customers, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who ordered books from an early catalogue, and later First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who needed help stocking the White House library with Americana. President Bill Clinton has been a regular customer ever since the owners restored his flood-damaged collection of books in Chappaqua, New York. Other high-profile customers have included Michael Jackson, Stephen Sondheim, Princess Grace, Sally Field, Donatella Versace, Oriana Fallaci, and Kevin Rudd. Patti Smith was briefly an employee in 1967. In October 2012 the Argosy suffered extensive damage during Hurricane Sandy, when bricks dislodged from the 32nd story of the adjacent building and crashed through the store‚Äôs roof. The resulting flood affected the top two floors and destroyed many historical artifacts, including acts of congress signed by Thomas Jefferson. The store made a full recovery by the fall of 2013. In popular culture The Argosy, known for its elegant old-world interior, has been used as a setting for movies and TV dramas, including The Front with Woody Allen, Law and Order, and Person of Interest. Alfred Hitchcock‚Äôs film Vertigo also features a bookstore of the same name situated in San Francisco. It has also been used as a background for fashion shoots and television interviews. It was prominently featured in the 2018 movie Can You Ever Forgive Me? and is among the New York bookstores where the real-life Lee Israel had attempted to sell her forgeries. It was also featured in the 2019 movie The Goldfinch.

The office is led by Piet Eckert (*1968, Mumbai) and Wim Eckert (*1969, Z√ºrich) who founded E2A Architects in 2001. Overview The brothers Piet Eckert and Wim Eckert both graduated from the ETH Zurich in 1994 and 1995. After their studies they joined OMA, working from 1995 to 1997 in Rotterdam, Los Angeles and Seoul. In 2001 Piet and Wim established E2A Architects. They have taught at several schools and universities in Europe and have been Visiting Professors at the Academy of Architecture in Mendrisio since 2014. Their work has been widely published including the comprehensive monograph E2A in 2011 with Hatje Cantz, Silent Form in 2014 with Park Books and more recently the new monograph by 2G Magazine of Gustavo Gili Editors. Their work has expanded geographically and typologically with projects in the realm of the public, cultural, corporate, commercial and the housing sector. Their methodology of work confronts idealism with an inventory of realities. Out of this confrontation a sense of irony arises, a pleasure and a strategic contradiction to reassess an omnipresent burden of context and program. Desire and reality, narrative and analysis form an increasingly conflicted relationship. Therefore, E2A‚Äôs contributions do not necessarily adhere to a single vision of cohesion, but rather integrate discrepancies and disruptions with implicit organizational logic. Constraints are converted into architectural forms.

He achieved recognition as the first person of European descent to cross the Simpson Desert.Australian Dictionary of Biography Career His father was a farmer of Swedish descent and Colson was the first of eight children. Prior to his 15th birthday in 1896, Colson and his father travelled by sea to Esperance, Western Australia, then walked 150 miles to the gold-rush district of Norseman. During the next ten years, young Colson gained experience in prospecting, mining, timberwork and engine driving. Adelaide Advertiser 30 July 1940 Famous Bushman In 1904 he married Alice Jane Horne in Kalgoorlie and they remained married until he died. They moved to Victoria in 1917 for construction work, and in 1926 he started his own transport business from Healesville to Melbourne. Moving again in 1927 they went to South Australia to work on a new railway line between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs. Over the next four years, Colson travelled extensively in Central Australia and developed a rapport with the aboriginal people of the region. He was a guide and camel handler for the expeditions to the Petermann and Tomkinson Ranges by Michael Terry in 1930. Colson took up the lease of Bloods Creek station north-west of Oodnadatta in 1931 to run sheep and a local store. Desert crossing Ted Colson's expedition across the Simpson Desert in 1936 Although a number of explorers had probed the Simpson Desert from the mid 1800s, including Charles Sturt and Peter Warburton, none had made a successful crossing on foot. Cecil Madigan had made an aerial reconnaissance in 1929, which proved that the desert was composed of numerous parallel sand dunes, with no evidence of permanent water. In May 1936 after a season of good rains, Colson chose to attempt the crossing from west to east and return using five camels. On 27 May he set off from Mount Etingamba 53 miles north of Bloods Creek with a lone aboriginal companion Eringa Peter. He carried provisions for two months, a compass and maps and travelled due east following the 26th parallel. Facing approximately 140 miles of unknown country, they subsequently traversed over a thousand sand ridges. He named some hills near the western side after his wife Alice, and a dry salt feature Lake Tamblyn after John Tamblyn his school master who was the second most influential person in his life after his father. Advertiser 31 aug 1936. Tribute to Schoolmaster His course took him to Poeppel Corner (90 miles from Birdsville) where the states of Queensland and South Australia meet with the Northern Territory. Colson and Peter reached Birdsville on 11 June, and set out for the return journey three days later. He had missed the corner post on the outward trip (by only 300 yards), but found it on the return journey and took photographs as it was still in good condition after 50 years since its placement. They arrived back at Bloods Creek on 29 June 1936, after 36 days and almost 600 miles of travel. Pandora National Library of Australia Colson planned a second crossing in 1938, but it did not proceed due to a lack of resources. Final years Following his journey across the Simpson, Colson established the Colson Trading Company at Finke (now Aputula) in the Northern Territory. He ran a store and hotel, and became well known as a community leader. In 1948 he organised the Finke Amateur Racing Club's first horse race meeting, which was a resounding success.Centralian Advocate 2 April 1948 Just two years later in February 1950 while driving a new motor vehicle home from Adelaide, he collided with a power pole at Balaklava, South Australia and was killed.Centralian Advocate Fri 10 March 1950 Legacy * The Colson Track which runs from the middle of the Simpson Desert to Numery Station near Alice Springs is named after him. * The State Library of South Australia has a collection of Colson's papers, correspondence and maps (Acc.

Schools of Islamic theology are various Islamic schools and branches in different schools of thought regarding aqidah (creed). According to Muhammad Abu Zahra, Qadariyah, Jahmis, Murji'ah, Mu øtazila, Batiniyya, Ash'ari, Maturidi, Athari are the ancient schools of aqidah. The Meeting of the Theologians by Abd Allah Musawwir, mid-16th century. The main split between Sunni and Shia Islam was initially more political than theological, but over time theological differences have developed. Still, differences in aqidah occur as divisions orthogonal to the main divisions in Islam along political or fiqh lines, such that a Mu øtazili might, for example, belong to Ja'fari, Zaidi or even Hanafi school of jurisprudence.  Divinity schools in Islam  Aqidah is an Islamic term meaning \\"creed\\" or \\"belief\\". Any religious belief system, or creed, can be considered an example of aqidah. However this term has taken a significant technical usage in Muslim history and theology, denoting those matters over which Muslims hold conviction. The term is usually translated as \\"theology\\". Such traditions are divisions orthogonal to sectarian divisions of Islam, and a Mu'tazili may for example, belong to Jafari, Zaidi or even Hanafi school of jurisprudence. One of the earliest systematic theological school to develop, in the mid 8th-century, was Mu'tazila. It emphasized reason and rational thought, positing that the injunctions of God are accessible to rational thought and inquiry and that the Qur'an, albeit the word of God, was created rather than uncreated, which would develop into one of the most contentious questions in Islamic theology. In the 10th century, the Ash'ari school developed as a response to Mu'tazila, leading to the latter's decline. Ash'ari still taught the use of reason in understanding the Qur'an, but denied the possibility to deduce moral truths by reasoning. This was opposed by the school of Maturidi, which taught that certain moral truths may be found by the use of reason without the aid of revelation. Another point of contention was the relative position of iman (\\"faith\\") vs. taqwa (\\"piety\\"). Such schools of theology are summarized under Ilm al-Kalam, or \\"science of discourse\\", as opposed to mystical schools who deny that any theological truth may be discovered by means of discourse or reason.  Sunni schools of theology  Sunni Muslims are the largest denomination of Islam and are known as Ahl as-Sunnah wa‚Äôl-JamƒÅ‚Äòh or simply as Ahl as-Sunnah. The word Sunni comes from the word sunnah, which means the teachings and actions or examples of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Therefore, the term \\"Sunni\\" refers to those who follow or maintain the sunnah of the prophet Muhammad. The Sunnis believe that Muhammad did not appoint a successor to lead the Muslim ummah (community) before his death, and after an initial period of confusion, a group of his most prominent companions gathered and elected Abu Bakr, Muhammad's close friend and a father-in-law, as the first caliph of Islam. Sunni Muslims regard the first four caliphs (Abu Bakr, \`Umar ibn al-KhattƒÅb, Uthman Ibn Affan and Ali ibn Abu Talib) as \\"al-KhulafƒÅ‚Äôur- RƒÅshid≈´n\\" or \\"The Rightly Guided Caliphs.\\" After the Rashidun, the position turned into a hereditary right and the caliph's role was limited to being a political symbol of Muslim strength and unity. = Athari = Atharism (; textualism) is a movement of Islamic scholars who reject rationalistic Islamic theology (kalam) in favor of strict textualism in interpreting the Quran. The name is derived from the Arabic word ', literally meaning \\"remnant\\" and also referring to a \\"narrative\\". Their disciples are called the Athariyya, or Atharis. For followers of the Athari movement, the \\"clear\\" meaning of the Qur'an, and especially the prophetic traditions, has sole authority in matters of belief, and to engage in rational disputation (kalam), even if one arrives at the truth, is absolutely forbidden.Halverson, Theology and Creed in Sunni Islam, 2010: 36 Atharis engage in an amodal reading of the Qur'an, as opposed to one engaged in Ta'wil (metaphorical interpretation). They do not attempt to conceptualize the meanings of the Qur'an rationally, and believe that the \\"real\\" meaning should be consigned to God alone (tafwid).Halverson, Theology and Creed in Sunni Islam, 2010: 36-7 In essence, the meaning has been accepted without asking \\"how\\" or \\"Bi-la kaifa\\". On the other hand, the famous Hanbali scholar Ibn al-Jawzi states, in Kitab Akhbar as-Sifat, that Ahmad ibn Hanbal would have been opposed to anthropomorphic interpretations of Qur'anic texts such as those of al-Qadi Abu Ya'la, Ibn Hamid and Ibn az-Zaghuni.Swartz, Merlin. A Medieval Critique of Anthropomorphism. Brill, 2001, p.134-137 . Based on Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi's criticism of Athari-Hanbalis, Muhammad Abu Zahra, a Professor of Islamic law at Cairo University deduced that Salafi aqidah is located somewhere between ta'tili and anthropopathy (Absolute ·∫íƒÅhirƒ´sm in understanding the tashbih in Qur'an)Muhammad Abu Zahra, The history of Madh'habs and Divinity Schools in Islam.Scholar of renown: Muhammad Abu Zahrah. Ed. Adil Salahi for Arab News. Published Wednesday, 14 November 2001; accessed Sunday 9 June 2013. in Islam. Absolute ·∫íƒÅhirƒ´sm and total rejection of ta'wil are amongst the fundamental characteristics of this \\"new\\" Islamic school of theology. = Ilm al-KalƒÅm =  øIlm al-KalƒÅm (, literally \\"science of discourse\\"Winter, Tim J. \\"Introduction.\\" Introduction. The Cambridge Companion to Classical Islamic Theology. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2008. 4‚Äì5. Print.), usually foreshortened to kalam and sometimes called \\"Islamic scholastic theology\\", is a rational undertaking born out of the need to establish and defend the tenets of Islamic faith against doubters and detractors.Madeleine Pelner Cosman, Linda Gale Jones, Handbook to Life in the Medieval World, p 391. 'Ilm al-Kalam incorporates Aristotelian reasoning and logic into Islamic theology. A scholar of kalam is referred to as a mutakallim (plural mutakallim≈´n) as distinguished from philosophers, jurists, and scientists.Clinton Bennett, The Bloomsbury Companion to Islamic Studies, p 119. . There are many possible interpretations as to why this discipline was originally called \\"kalam\\"; one is that the widest controversy in this discipline has been about whether the Word of God, as revealed in the Qur'an, can be considered part of God's essence and therefore not created, or whether it was made into words in the normal sense of speech, and is therefore created.  Ash'ariyyah  The Mu'tazila were challenged by Abu al-Hasan Al-Ash'ari, who famously defected from the Mu'tazila and formed the rival Ash'ari school of theology.John L. Esposito, The Oxford History of Islam, p 280. The Ash'ari school took the opposite position of the Mu'tazila and insisted that truth cannot be known through reason alone. The Ash'ari school further claimed that truth can only be known through revelation. The Ash'ari claim that without revelation, the unaided human mind would not be able to know if something is good or evil. Today, the Ash'ari school is considered one of the Orthodox schools of theology. The Ash'ari school is the basis of the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence, which has supplied it with most of its most famous disciples. The most famous of these are Abul-Hassan Al-Bahili, Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani, al-Juwayni, Al-Razi and Al-Ghazali. Thus Al-Ash\`ari‚Äôs school became, together with the Maturidi, the main schools reflecting the beliefs of the Sunnah.  MƒÅt≈´rƒ´d‚Äôiyyah  The Maturidi school was founded by Abu Mansur Al Maturidi, and is the most popular theological school amongst Muslims, especially in the areas formerly controlled by the Ottomans and the Mughals. Today, the Maturidi school is the position favored by the ahl al-ra'y (people of reason), which includes only the Hanafi school of fiqh who make up the majority of sunni Muslims. The Maturidi school takes the middle position between the Ash'ari and Mu'tazili schools on the questions of knowing truth and free will. The Maturidis say that the unaided human mind is able to find out that some of the more major sins such as alcohol or murder are evil without the help of revelation, but still maintain that revelation is the ultimate source of knowledge. Additionally, the Maturidi believe that God created and can control all of His creation, but that he allows humans to make individual decisions and choices for themselves.  Jahmiyyah  Jahmis were the followers of the Islamic theologian Jahm bin Safwan who associate himself with Al-Harith ibn Surayj. He was an exponent of extreme determinism according to which a man acts only metaphorically in the same way in which the sun acts or does something when it sets. This is the position adopted by the Ash'ari school, which holds that God's omnipotence is absolute and perfect over all creation.  Qadariyyah  Qadariyyah is an originally derogatory term designating early Islamic theologians who asserted human beings are ontologically free and have a perfect free will, whose exercise justifies divine punishment and absolving God of responsibility for evil in the world.J. van Ess. Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed, Brill. \\"ƒ∂adariyya\\", vol.4, p. 368. Their doctrines were adopted by the Mu'tazilis and rejected by the Ash'aris. The tension between free will and God's omnipotence was later reconciled by the Maturidi school of theology, which asserted that God grants human beings their agency, but can remove or otherwise alter it at any time. = Mu øtazila = The first group to pursue this undertaking were the Mu'tazila, who asserted that all truth could be known through reason alone. Mu'tazili theology originated in the 8th century in Basra when Wasil Ibn 'Ata' stormed out of a lesson of Hasan al-Basri following a theological dispute. The Mu'tazila asserted that everything in revelation could be found through rational means alone. The Mu'tazila were heavily influenced by the Greek philosophy they encountered and began to adopt the ideas of Plotinus, whose Neoplatonic theology caused an enormous backlash against them. The political backlash the Mu'tazila faced, as well as the challenged brought forth by new schools of theology caused this group to atrophy and decline into irrelevancy. They are no longer considered an Orthodox school of theology by Sunni Muslims.  Bishriyya  Bishriyya followed the teachings of Bishr ibn al-Mu'tamir which were distinct from Wasil ibn Ata.  B√¢‚Äô Hashim‚Äôiyyah  B√¢h‚Äô Sham‚ÄôiyyahHumanism in the renaissance of Islam: the cultural revival during the Buyid Age, by Joel Kramer,, was a school of Mu'tazili thought, rivaling the school of Qadi Abd al-Jabbar, based primarily on the earlier teaching of Abu Hashim al-Jubba'i,Frank, Richard M. \\"The Autonomy of the Human Agent in the Teaching of 'Abd al-Gabbar.\\" Le Mus√©on 95(1982): 323‚Äì355 the son of Abu 'Ali Muhammad al-Jubba'i.  Muhakkima  The groups that were seceded from Ali's army in the end of the Arbitration Incident constituted the branch of Muhakkima (). They mainly divided into two major sects called as Kharijites and Ibadis. = Khawarij = The Kharijites considered the caliphate of Abu Bakr and Umar to be rightly guided but believed that Uthman ibn Affan had deviated from the path of justice and truth in the last days of his caliphate, and hence was liable to be killed or displaced. They also believed that Ali ibn Abi Talib committed a grave sin when he agreed on the arbitration with Mu øƒÅwiyah. In the Battle of Siffin, Ali acceded to Muawiyah's suggestion to stop the fighting and resort to negotiation. A large portion of Ali's troops (who later became the first Kharijites) refused to concede to that agreement, and they considered that Ali had breached a Qur'anic verse which states that The decision is only for Allah (Qur'an 6:57), which the Kharijites interpreted to mean that the outcome of a conflict can only be decided in battle (by God) and not in negotiations (by human beings). The Kharijites thus deemed the arbitrators (Abu Musa al-Ash øari and Amr Ibn Al-As), the leaders who appointed these arbitrators (Ali and Mu øƒÅwiyah) and all those who agreed on the arbitration (all companions of Ali and Mu øƒÅwiyah) as KuffƒÅr (disbelievers), having breached the rules of the Qur'an. They believed that all participants in the Battle of Jamal, including Talha, Zubair (both being companions of Muhammad) and Aisha had committed a Kabira (major sin in Islam).Abul Ala Maududi, \\"Khilafat-o-Malookeyat\\" in Urdu language, (Caliphate and kingship), p 214. Kharijites reject the doctrine of infallibility for the leader of the Muslim community, in contrast to Shi'a but in agreement with Sunnis.Baydawi, Abdullah. \\"Tawali' al- Anwar min Matali' al-Anzar\\", circa 1300. Translated alongside other texts in the 2001 \\"Nature, Man and God in Medieval Islam\\" by Edwin Elliott Calverley and James Wilson Pollock. pp. 1001‚Äì1009 Modern-day Islamic scholar Abul Ala Maududi wrote an analysis of Kharijite beliefs, marking a number of differences between Kharijism and Sunni Islam. The Kharijites believed that the act of sinning is analogous to Kufr (disbelief) and that every grave sinner was regarded as a KƒÅfir (disbeliever) unless he repents. With this argument, they denounced all the above-mentioned ·π¢a·∏•ƒÅbah and even cursed and used abusive language against them. Ordinary Muslims were also declared disbelievers because first, they were not free of sin; secondly they regarded the above-mentioned ·π¢a·∏•ƒÅbah as believers and considered them as religious leaders, even inferring Islamic jurisprudence from the Hadeeth narrated by them. They also believed that it is not a must for the caliph to be from the Quraysh. Any pious Muslim nominated by other Muslims could be an eligible caliph. Additionally, Kharijites believed that obedience to the caliph is binding as long as he is managing the affairs with justice and consultation, but if he deviates, then it becomes obligatory to confront him, demote him and even kill him. = Ibadiyya = Ibadiyya has some common beliefs overlapping with Ashari, Mu'tazila, Sunni and some Shi'ites.  Murji'ah  Murji'ah () is an early Islamic school whose followers are known in English as \\"Murjites\\" or \\"Murji'ites\\" (). The Murji'ah emerged as a theological school in response to the Kharijites on the early question about the relationship between sin and apostasy (rida). The Murji'ah believed that sin did not affect a person's beliefs (iman) but rather their piety (taqwa). Therefore, they advocated the idea of \\"delayed judgement,\\" (irjaa). The Murji'ah maintain that anyone who proclaims the bare minimum of faith must be considered a Muslim, and sin alone cannot cause someone to become a disbeliever (kafir). The Murjite opinion would eventually dominate that of the Kharijites and become the mainstream opinion in Sunni Islam. The later schools of Sunni theology adopted their stance while form more developed theological schools and concepts.  Shia schools of theology  = Zaydi-Fivers = The Zaidi School of Divinity is close to the Mu'tazilite school. There are a few issues between both schools, most notably the Zaydi doctrine of the Imamate, which is rejected by the Mu'tazilites. Amongst the Shi'a, Zaydis are most similar to Sunnis since Zaydism shares similar doctrines and jurisprudential opinions with Sunni scholars. = BƒÅ·π≠en‚Äôiyyah = The BƒÅ·π≠en‚Äôiyyah  øAqƒ´dah, was originally introduced by Abu‚Äôl-KhƒÅttƒÅb Muhammad ibn Abu Zaynab al-Asadƒ´, and later developed by Maym≈´n al-QaddƒÅh√ñz, Mustafa, Mezhepler Tarihi ve Terimleri S√∂zl√ºƒü√º (The History of madh'habs and its terminology dictionary), Ensar Yayƒ±ncƒ±lƒ±k, ƒ∞stanbul, 2011. (This is the name of the trainer of Muhammad bin IsmƒÅ‚Äòƒ´l as-·π£aghƒ´r ibn JƒÅ‚Äôfar. He had established the principles of the BƒÅ·π≠en‚Äôiyyah Madh'hab, later. and his son  øAbd AllƒÅh ibn Maym≈´n for the esoteric interpretation of the Qur'an. The members of Batiniyyah may belong to either Ismailis or Twelvers.  Imami-IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´s  The IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´ ImƒÅmate differ from Twelvers because they had living imams or da'is for centuries. They followed Isma'il ibn Jafar, elder brother of Musa al-Kadhim, as the rightful ImamRise of The Fatimids, by W. Ivanow. Page 81, 275 after his father Ja'far al-Sadiq. The Ismailis believe that whether Imam Ismail did or did not die before Imam Ja'far, he had passed on the mantle of the imƒÅmate to his son Mu·∏•ammad ibn IsmƒÅ'ƒ´l al-Maktum as the next imam.  Batini-Twelver  øAqƒ´dah schools  The followers of \\"Batiniyyah-Twelver\\" madh'hab consist of Alevis and Nusayris, who developed their own fiqh system and do not pursue the Ja'fari jurisprudence. Their combined population is nearly around 1% of World overall Muslim population. = Alevism = Alevis are sometimes categorized as part of Twelver Shia Islam, and sometimes as its own religious tradition, as it has markedly different philosophy, customs, and rituals. They have many Tasawwufƒ´ characteristics and express belief in the Qur'an and The Twelve Imams, but reject polygamy and accept religious traditions predating Islam, like Turkish shamanism. They are significant in East-Central Turkey. They are sometimes considered a Sufi sect, and have an untraditional form of religious leadership that is not scholarship oriented like other Sunni and Shia groups. Seven to Eleven Million Alevi people including the other denominations of Twelver Shi'ites live in Anatolia.  Alevi Islamic school of divinity  In Turkey, Shia Muslim people belong to the Ja'fari jurisprudence Madhhab, which tracks back to the sixth Shia Imam Ja'far al- Sadiq (also known as Imam Jafar-i Sadiq), are called as the Ja'faris, who belong to Twelver Shia. Although the Alevi Turks are being considered as a part of Twelver Shia Islam, their belief is different from the Ja'fari jurisprudence in conviction. * \\"The Alevi-Turks\\" has a unique and perplex conviction tracing back to Kaysanites Shia and Khurramites which are considered as Ghulat Shia. According to Turkish scholar Abd√ºlbaki G√∂lpinarli, the Qizilbash (\\"Red-Heads\\") of the 16th century ‚Äì a religious and political movement in Azerbaijan that helped to establish the Safavid dynasty ‚Äì were \\"spiritual descendants of the Khurramites\\".Roger M. Savory (ref. Abd√ºlbaki G√∂lpinarli), Encyclopaedia of Islam, \\"Kizil-Bash\\", Online Edition 2005 * Among the members of the \\"Qizilbash-Tariqah\\" who are considered as a sub-sect of the Alevis, two figures firstly Abu Muslim Khorasani who assisted Abbasid Caliphate to beat Umayyad Caliphate, but later eliminated and murdered by Caliph Al-Mansur, and secondly Babak Khorramdin who incited a rebellion against the Abbasid Caliphate and consequently was killed by Caliph al- Mu'tasim are highly respected. This belief provides strong clues about their Kaysanites Shia and Khurramites origins. In addition, the \\"Safaviyya Tariqah\\" leader Ismail I is a highly regarded individual in the belief of \\"Alevi- Qizilbash-Tariqah\\" associating them with the Imamah (Shia Twelver doctrine) conviction of the \\"Twelver Shi'a Islam\\". * Their aqidah (theological conviction) is based upon a syncretic fiqh system called as \\"Batiniyya-Sufism\\" which incorporates some Qarmatian sentiments, originally introduced by \\"Abu‚Äôl-KhƒÅttƒÅb Muhammad ibn Abu Zaynab al-Asadƒ´\\", and later developed by \\"Maymun al-QƒÅddƒÅh\\" and his son \\" øAbd AllƒÅh ibn Maymun\\", and \\"Mu'tazila\\" with a strong belief in The Twelve Imams. * Not all of the members believe that the fasting in Ramadan is obligatory although some Alevi-Turks performs their fasting duties partially in Ramadan. * Some beliefs of Shamanism still are common amongst the Qizilbash Alevi-Turkish people in villages. * On the other hand, the members of Bektashi Order have a conviction of \\"Batiniyya Isma'ilism\\" and \\"Hurufism\\" with a strong belief in The Twelve Imams. * In conclusion, Qizilbash-Alevis are not a part of Ja'fari jurisprudence fiqh, even though they can be considered as members of different Tariqa of Shia Islam all looks like sub-classes of Twelver.

Over 85% of the population, on the other hand, overwhelmingly constitute Maturidi aqidah of the Hanafi fiqh and Ash'ari aqidah of the Shafi'i fiqh of the Sunni followers.)   øAqƒ´dah of Alevi- Islam Dƒ´n Services  *Some of the differences that mark Alevis from Shi'a Islam are the non-observance of the five daily prayers and prostrations (they only bow twice in the presence of their spiritual leader), Ramadan, and the Hajj (they consider the pilgrimage to Mecca an external pretense, the real pilgrimage being internal in one's heart); and non-attendance of mosques. *Some of their members (or sub-groups) claim that God takes abode in the bodies of the human-beings (·∏•ul≈´l), believe in metempsychosis (tanƒÅsukh), and consider Islamic law to be not obligatory (ibƒÅ·∏•a), similar to antinomianism. *Some of the Alevis criticizes the course of Islam as it is being practiced overwhelmingly by more than 99% of Sunni and Shia population. *They believe that major additions had been implemented during the time of Ummayads, and easily refuse some basic principles on the grounds that they believe it contradicts with the holy book of Islam, namely the Qur'an. *Regular daily salat and fasting in the holy month of Ramadan are officially not accepted by some members of Alevism. *Some of their sub-groups like Ishikists and Bektashis, who portrayed themselves as Alevis, neither comprehend the essence of the regular daily salat (prayers) and fasting in the holy month of Ramadan that is frequently accentuated at many times in Quran, nor admits that these principles constitute the ineluctable foundations of the Dƒ´n of Islam as they had been laid down by Allah and they had been practised in an uninterruptible manner during the period of Prophet Muhammad. *Furthermore, during the period of Ottoman Empire, Alevis were forbidden to proselytise, and Alevism regenerated itself internally by paternal descent. To prevent penetration by hostile outsiders, the Alevis insisted on strict endogamy which eventually made them into a quasi-ethnic group. Alevi taboos limited interaction with the dominant Sunni political-religious centre. Excommunication was the ultimate punishment threatening those who married outsiders, cooperated with outsiders economically, or ate with outsiders. It was also forbidden to use the state (Sunni) courts. = BaktƒÅshism (Bekta≈üilik) = The founder of the Bektashiyyah sufi order Hacƒ± Bekta≈ü-ƒ± Veli (·∏§ƒÅjjƒ´ BaktƒÅsh Walƒ´), a murid of MalƒÅmatƒ´-QalƒÅndƒÅrƒ´ Sheikh Qutb ad-Dƒ´n Haydar, who introduced the Ahmad Yasavi's doctrine of \\"Four Doors and Forty Stending\\" into his tariqah.  BaktƒÅshi Islamic School of Divinity  The Bektashiyyah is a Shia Sufi order founded in the 13th century by Haji Bektash Veli, a dervish who escaped Central Asia and found refuge with the Seljuks in Anatolia at the time of the Mongol invasions (1219‚Äì23). This order gained a great following in rural areas and it later developed in two branches: the √áelebi clan, who claimed to be physical descendants of Haji Bektash Veli, were called \\"Bel evladlarƒ±\\" (children of the loins), and became the hereditary spiritual leaders of the rural Alevis; and the Babaƒüan, those faithful to the path \\"Yol evladlarƒ±\\" (children of the way), who dominated the official Bektashi Sufi order with its elected leadership. Bektashism places much emphasis on the concept of Wahdat- ul-Wujood Ÿàÿ≠ÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑŸàÿ¨ŸàÿØ, the \\"Unity of Being\\" that was formulated by Ibn Arabi. This has often been labeled as pantheism, although it is a concept closer to panentheism. Bektashism is also heavily permeated with Shiite concepts, such as the marked veneration of Ali, The Twelve Imams, and the ritual commemoration of Ashurah marking the Battle of Karbala. The old Persian holiday of Nowruz is celebrated by Bektashis as Imam Ali's birthday. In keeping with the central belief of Wahdat-ul-Wujood the Bektashi see reality contained in Haqq-Muhammad-Ali, a single unified entity. Bektashi do not consider this a form of trinity. There are many other practices and ceremonies that share similarity with other faiths, such as a ritual meal (muhabbet) and yearly confession of sins to a baba (magfirat-i zunub ŸÖÿ∫ŸÅÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ∞ŸÜŸàÿ®). Bektashis base their practices and rituals on their non-orthodox and mystical interpretation and understanding of the Qur'an and the prophetic practice (Sunnah). They have no written doctrine specific to them, thus rules and rituals may differ depending on under whose influence one has been taught. Bektashis generally revere Sufi mystics outside of their own order, such as Ibn Arabi, Al-Ghazali and Jelalludin Rumi who are close in spirit to them.  The BaktƒÅshi  øaqƒ´dah  Four Spiritual Stations in Bektashiyyah: Sharia, tariqa, haqiqa, and the fourth station, marifa, which is considered \\"unseen\\", is actually the center of the haqiqa region. Marifa is the essence of all four stations. The Bektashi Order is a Sufi order and shares much in common with other Islamic mystical movements, such as the need for an experienced spiritual guide ‚Äî called a baba in Bektashi parlance ‚Äî as well as the doctrine of \\"the four gates that must be traversed\\": the \\"Sharia\\" (religious law), \\"Tariqah\\" (the spiritual path), \\"Haqiqah\\" (truth), and \\"Marifa\\" (true knowledge). Bektashis hold that the Qur'an has two levels of meaning: an outer (ZƒÅher ÿ∏ÿßŸáÿ±) and an inner (bƒÅ·π≠en ÿ®ÿßÿ∑ŸÜ). They hold the latter to be superior and eternal and this is reflected in their understanding of both the universe and humanity, which is a view that can also be found in Ismailism and Batiniyya. Bektashism is also initiatic and members must traverse various levels or ranks as they progress along the spiritual path to the Reality. First level members are called a≈üƒ±ks ÿπÿßÿ¥ŸÇ. They are those who, while not having taken initiation into the order, are nevertheless drawn to it. Following initiation (called nasip) one becomes a m√ºhip ŸÖÿ≠ÿ®. After some time as a m√ºhip, one can take further vows and become a dervish. The next level above dervish is that of baba. The baba (lit. father) is considered to be the head of a tekke and qualified to give spiritual guidance (irshad ÿ•ÿ±ÿ¥ÿßÿØ). Above the baba is the rank of halife-baba (or dede, grandfather). Traditionally there were twelve of these, the most senior being the dedebaba (great-grandfather). The dedebaba was considered to be the highest ranking authority in the Bektashi Order. Traditionally the residence of the dedebaba was the Pir Evi (The Saint's Home) which was located in the shrine of Hajji Bektash Wali in the central Anatolian town of Hacƒ±bekta≈ü (Solucakarah√ºy√ºk). = IthnƒÅ'ashariyyah = Twelvers believe in twelve Imams. The twelfth Imam is believed to be in occultation, and will appear again just before the Qiyamah (Islamic view of the Last Judgment). The Shia hadiths include the sayings of the Imams. Many Muslims criticise the Shia for certain beliefs and practices, including practices such as the Mourning of Muharram (M√§tam). They are the largest Shia school of thought (93%), predominant in Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Bahrain and have a significant population in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan Kuwait and the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia. The Twelver Shia are followers of either the Jaf'ari or Batiniyyah madh'habs.  Imami- Ja'faris  Followers of the Jaf'ari madh'hab are divided into the following sub-divisions, all of them are the followers of the Theology of Twelvers: = Usulism = The Usuli form the overwhelming majority within the Twelver Shia denomination. They follow a Marja-i Taqlid on the subject of taqlid and fiqh. They are concentrated in Iran, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, India, Iraq, and Lebanon. Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf, Iraq, where Ali the first Shia Imam is buried. = Akhbarism = Akhbari, similar to Usulis, however reject ijtihad in favor of hadith. Concentrated in Bahrain. = Shaykhism = Shaykhism is an Islamic religious movement founded by Shaykh Ahmad in the early 19th century Qajar dynasty, Iran, now retaining a minority following in Iran and Iraq. It began from a combination of Sufi and Shia and Akhbari doctrines. In the mid 19th-century many Shaykhis converted to the B√°b√≠ and Bah√°'√≠ religions, which regard Shaykh Ahmad highly.  GhulƒÅt-Imamis  =‚ÄòAlawism= Alawites are also called Nusayris, Nusairis, Namiriya or Ansariyya. Their madhhab is established by Ibn Nusayr, and their aqidah is developed by Al-Kha·π£ƒ´bƒ´. They follow Cillƒ´ aqidah of \\"Maym≈´n ibn Abu‚Äôl-QƒÅsim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-TabarƒÅnƒ´ fiqh\\" of the ‚ÄòAlawis.\\"Muhammad ibn ƒÄliyy‚Äô≈´l Cillƒ´ aqidah\\" of \\"Maym≈´n ibn Abu‚Äôl-QƒÅsim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-TabarƒÅnƒ´ fiqh\\" (S≈´laiman Affandy, Al-BƒÅk≈´rat‚Äô≈´s S≈´laiman‚Äôƒ´yyah ‚Äì Family tree of the Nusayri Tariqat, pp. 14‚Äì15, Beirut, 1873.)Both Muhammad ibn ƒÄliyy‚Äô≈´l Cillƒ´ and Maym≈´n ibn Abu‚Äôl-QƒÅsim‚Äôat-TabarƒÅnƒ´ were the murids of \\"Al-Kha·π£ƒ´bƒ´,\\" the founder of the Nusayri tariqat. One million three hundred and fifty thousand of them lived in Syria and Lebanon in 1970. It is estimated they are 10‚Äì12% of the population of Syria of 23 million in 2013. ‚ÄòAlawite Islamic School of Divinity  Alawites consider themselves to be Muslims, although some Sunnis dispute that they are.\\"Alawi Islam\\". Globalsecurity.org Alawite doctrine incorporates Gnostic, neo-Platonic, Islamic, Christian and other elements and has, therefore, been described as syncretistic. Their theology is based on a divine triad, or trinity, which is the core of Alawite belief. The triad comprises three emanations of the one God: the supreme aspect or entity called the \\"Essence\\" or the \\"Meaning\\" (both being translations of ma'na), together with two lesser emanations known as his \\"Name\\" (ism), or \\"Veil\\" (hijab), and his \\"Gate\\" (bab). These emanations have manifested themselves in different human forms over several cycles in history, the last cycle of which was as Ali (the Essence/Meaning), Muhammad (the Name) and Salman the Persian (the Gate). Alawite belief is summarised in the formula: \\"I turn to the Gate; I bow before the Name; I adore the Meaning\\". The claim that Alawites believe Ali is a deity has been contested by some scholars as a misrepresentation on the basis that Ali is, in fact, considered an \\"essence or form\\", not a human being, by which believers can \\"grasp God\\". Alawites also hold that they were originally stars or divine lights that were cast out of heaven through disobedience and must undergo repeated reincarnation (or metempsychosis) before returning to heaven. They can be reincarnated as Christians or others through sin and as animals if they become infidels.Alawis, Countrystudies.us, U.S. Library of Congress. Alawite beliefs have never been confirmed by their modern religious authorities.'Abd al‚ÄëLatif al‚ÄëYunis, Mudhakkirat al‚ÄëDuktur 'Abd al‚ÄëLatif al‚ÄëYunis, Damascus: Dar al‚Äë\`Ilm, 1992, p. 63. Alawites tend to conceal their beliefs (taqiyya) due to historical persecution.Secretive sect of the rulers of Syria, The Telegraph, 05 Aug 2011 Some tenets of the faith are secret, known only to a select few; therefore, they have been described as a mystical sect. In addition to Islamic festivals, the Alawites have been reported to celebrate or honor certain Christian festivals such as the birth of Jesus and Palm Sunday. Their most-important feast is Eid al-Ghadeer. The ‚ÄòAlawite  øaqƒ´dah Alawites have always described themselves as being Twelver Shi'ite Muslims and have been recognized as such by the prominent Lebanese Shi'ite cleric Musa al-Sadr. The Sunni Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini issued a fatwa recognising them as part of the Muslim community in the interest of Arab nationalism. However, Athari Sunni (modern day Salafis) scholars such as Ibn Kathir (a disciple of Ibn Taymiyya) have categorised Alawites as pagans in their writings.Abd-Allah, Umar F., Islamic Struggle in Syria, Berkeley : Mizan Press, c1983, pp. 43‚Äì48 Barry Rubin has suggested that Syrian leader Hafiz al-Assad and his son and successor Bashar al-Assad pressed their fellow Alawites \\"to behave like regular Muslims, shedding (or at least concealing) their distinctive aspects\\". During the early 1970s a booklet, al-\`Alawiyyun Shi'atu Ahl al-Bait (\\"The Alawites are Followers of the Household of the Prophet\\") was published, which was \\"signed by numerous 'Alawi' men of religion\\", described the doctrines of the Imami Shia as Alawite. Additionally, there has been a recent movement to unite Alawism and the other branches of Twelver Islam through educational exchange programs in Syria and Qom. Some sources have discussed the \\"Sunnification\\" of Alawites under the al-Assad regime. Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies, writes that Hafiz al-Assad \\"tried to turn Alawites into 'good' (read Sunnified) Muslims in exchange for preserving a modicum of secularism and tolerance in society\\". On the other hand, Al-Assad \\"declared the Alawites to be nothing but Twelver Shiites\\".Syrian comment. Asad's Alawi dilemma, 8 October 2004 In a paper, \\"Islamic Education in Syria\\", Landis wrote that \\"no mention\\" is made in Syrian textbooks (controlled by the Al-Assad regime) of Alawites, Druze, Ismailis or Shia Islam; Islam was presented as a monolithic religion. Ali Sulayman al-Ahmad, chief judge of the Baathist Syrian state, has said: = Kƒ±zƒ±lba≈ülƒ±k =  The Qizilbash  øaqƒ´dah  Shah Ismail I, the Sheikh of the Safavi tariqa, founder of the Safavid Dynasty of Iran, and the Commander-in-chief of the Kƒ±zƒ±lba≈ü armies had contributed a lot for the development and implementation of The Qizilbash  øAqƒ´dah amongst the Turkmen people. Qizilbash and Bektashi tariqah shared common religious beliefs and practices becoming intermingled as Alevis in spite of many local variations. Isolated from both the Sunni Ottomans and the Twelver Shi\`a Safavids, Qizilbash and Bektashi developed traditions, practices, and doctrines by the early 17th century which marked them as a closed autonomous religious community. As a result of the immense pressures to conform to Sunni Islam, all members of Alevism developed a tradition of opposition (ibƒÅ·∏•a) to all forms of external religion. The doctrine of Qizilbashism is well explained in the following poem written by the Shaykh of Safaviyya tariqah ShƒÅh IsmƒÅ øil Khatai: The lines of poetry above may easily be judged as an act of \\"Shirk\\" (polytheism) by the Sunni Ulama, but they have a bƒÅ·π≠enƒ´ ta æwƒ´l (inner explanation) in Qizilbashism.  Tashbih  = Karram‚Äôiyyah = Anthropomorphic-Anthropopathic Karram‚Äôiyyah was founded by Ab≈´  øAbd AllƒÅh Mu·∏•ammad b. KarrƒÅm. Ibn Karram considered that God was a substance and that He had a body (jism) finite in certain directions when He comes into contact with the Throne. = Anthropopathy in the history of GhulƒÅt Shia = The belief of Incarnation was first emerged in Saba æiyya, and later some personalities like Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, Abu Muslim, Sunpadh, Ishaq al-Turk, Al-Muqanna, Babak Khorramdin, Maziar and Ismail I had become the subject of God incarnates.  Ahmad‚Äôiyyah  The Ahmadis' beliefs are more aligned with the Sunni tradition, such as The Five Pillars of Islam and The Six articles of Islamic Faith. Likewise, Ahmadis accept the Qur'an as their holy text, face the Kaaba during prayer, accept the authority of Hadiths (reported sayings of and stories about Muhammad) and practice the Sunnah (traditions) of Muhammad.Annemarie Schimmel et al.: Der Islam III. Volksfr√∂mmigkeit, Islamische Kultur, Zeitgen√∂ssische Str√∂mungen. Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart 1990, S. 418‚Äì420 However, many Muslims consider Ahmadis as either kafirs or heretics. Ahmadi teachings state that the founders of all the major world religions had divine origins. God was working towards the establishment of Islam as the final religion, because it was the most complete and included all the previous teachings of other religion (but they believe that all other religions have gone astray in their present form). The completion and consummation of the development of religion came about with the coming of Muhammad; and that the perfection of the ‚Äòmanifestation‚Äô of Muhammad's prophethood and of the conveyance of his message was destined to occur with the coming of the Mahdi. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community regard Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who claimed to be the promised Messiah (\\"Second Coming of Christ\\") the Mahdi awaited by the Muslims and a 'subordinate' prophet to Muhammad whose job was to restore the Sharia given to Muhammad by guiding or rallying disenchanted Ummah back to Islam and thwart attacks on Islam by its opponents, as the \\"Promised One\\" of all religions fulfilling eschatological prophecies found in the scriptures of the Abrahamic religions, as well as Zoroastrianism, the Indian religions, Native American traditions and others.Invitation to Ahmadiyyat by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad Part II, Argument 4, Chapter \\"Promised Messiah, Promised One of All Religions\\" Ahmadi Muslims believe that Ahmad was divinely commissioned as a true reflection of Muhammad's prophethood to establish the unity of God and to remind mankind of their duties towards God and God's creation.

As a portion of the New Jersey organized militia, it existed as an entity from 1895 to 1963 and again from 1999 to the present time. As a naval militia, the NJNM was partially regulated and can be equipped by the federal government, but now serves as a reserve force which falls under control of the State of New Jersey. Naval militias are authorized and regulated by federal law under Title 32 of the United States Code. New Jersey law also allows for the state to maintain a naval militia. As it falls under state jurisdiction, the Governor of New Jersey is the Commander-in-chief of the NJNM. History The New Jersey Naval Militia, originally called the Naval Reserve of New Jersey, was founded in 1895, with the purpose of protecting the coast, harbors, and waterfront property. After the passage of the Federal Naval Reserve Law of 1916, the name was changed to the Naval Militia of New Jersey. The NJNM first saw combat during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and also fought in the World War I and World War II. After reaching a peak strength of 3,590 during the Korean War, the NJNM was absorbed by the United States Naval Reserve in 1963, after which it ceased to exist as an independent organization. In 1999, the NJNM was reorganized by Governor Christine Todd-Whitman to better integrate the NJNM with the New Jersey State Guard. After the attacks of September 11, 2001 the NJNM was called to State Active Duty (SAD) to assist in recovery, including a deployment of the NJNM's Disaster Medical Assistance Team and the Chaplain Corps to Staten Island, and the ferrying of evidence collected from Ground Zero to Manhattan's Chelsea Pier and Staten Island. The NJNM also took part in Operation Noble Eagle. Duties As a naval militia, in the aftermath of the attacks of 9/11, the NJNM was responsible for aiding in homeland security operations and disaster recovery. Missions conducted by the NJNM between September 11, 2001, and 2002 include: * Waterborne security at the bases of the George Washington Bridge * Daylight vessel traffic control on the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge * Standby vessel for search and rescue detail Coast Guard Station Sandy Hook, NJ * Transport of military personnel and equipment from NJ to North Cove (Ground Zero) * V.I.P. transportation and security detail for Liberty State Park tribute events during October 2001 * 192 days of water- borne security assisting naval personnel at Naval Weapons Station Earle * 180 days of continuous daylight patrols assisting the NJ State Police at Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Salem, NJ * Assisted with security in Jamaica Bay, NY during the aftermath of the crash of Flight 194, Kennedy Airport In April 2002, at the conclusion of Operation Noble Eagle, due to unresolved issues cited by the Adjutant General, the NJNM was stood down from State Active Duty by the Adjutant General. Organization The NJNM was originally organized at a brigade level. By 1912, the NJNM was organized into two brigades, consisting of 346 members, and different ships loaned by the federal government: the monitor U.S.S. Ajax in 1898, and the vessels USS Vixen, USS Adams, and USS Marietta. After its reactivation in 1999, the NJNM was integrated into the New Jersey State Guard in a way which would allow civilian volunteers into its naval militia while still technically meeting the requirement that 95% of a naval militia be composed of navy, marine, and coast guard reservists in order to receive federal aid. This was done by organizing the NJNM into three battalions, with the first battalion being composed solely of navy, marine, and coast guard reservists in order to receive access to federal support and Navy and Marine Corps facilities. The second battalion was organized as an operational Naval State Guard, composed largely of former service members and the 3rd Division providing support and auxiliary functions. By only seeking federal recognition for the first battalion as a naval militia, and considering the other two as divisions of the New Jersey State Guard, the NJNM is potentially able to receive federal aid and include civilian volunteers. Equipment Since reactivation in 1999, the NJNM had maintained eight boats donated by the city of Linden, the U.S. Coast Guard and the New Jersey State Police. NJNM currently maintains four 23 foot Monarch aluminum patrol boats, and a former Navy 24 foot diesel powered aluminum patrol boat. As a federally recognized naval militia, the first battalion of the NJNM would be allowed supplies from the federal government and access to United States Marine Corps and United States Navy facilities.

A member of the genus Myrmecia in the subfamily Myrmeciinae, it was first described by American entomologist Walter Cecil Crawley in 1925. These ants are medium to large in size, measuring , and they are bright brownish-red in colour. Queens and workers share similar morphological features, but they can be distinguished by the noticeable size difference. Males also look similar, but collected specimens are too damaged to be examined properly. M. regularis is found in the south-western coastal regions, inhabiting eucalypt woodland and open forests. They nest underground and do not build mounds. Workers are active during the day and night, foraging on trees in search for prey and sweet substances such as sap and nectar. The larvae are strictly carnivorous and only eat insects that workers capture. Nuptial flight occurs around February to April, with queens shedding their wings inside the nest and mating near to their parent nest. Queens tend to look for food for their young before they hatch, taking as long as eight months to develop. Certain frog species are known to dwell inside M. regularis colonies. Taxonomy Myrmecia regularis was first described by American entomologist Walter Cecil Crawley, who provided the first detailed description of the ant in a 1925 article, \\"New ants from Australia - II\\", published in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History. The ant was described from two syntype workers Crawley collected from Albany, Western Australia, now preserved in Crawley's collection in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. This name was initially short-lived, with Australian entomologist John S. Clark synonymising M. regularis with Myrmecia lucida, now a junior synonym of Myrmecia forficata. Clark's reasons for this were unknown, and William Morton Wheeler revived the species from synonymy, stating that specimens he and W.S. Brooks collected from southwest Australia were distinct from M. lucida, after comparing the two. Wheeler also stated that M. lucida was similar to M. forficata. Despite disagreeing with Wheeler's views, Clark noted in his publication that Wheeler's classification should be retained until the type specimen of M. lucida could be properly examined. In this same publication, Clark synonymised M. lucida with M. regularis. In 1991, entomologists Kazuo Ogata and Robert Taylor reviewed the species groups of Myrmecia. They assigned M. regularis to the M. gulosa species group, based on the morphological characters of worker ants. Description Head detail of M. regularis Excluding the mandibles, M. regularis workers measure , with the mandibles measuring . Including the mandibles, workers measure , queens are and males are . These ants are bright brownish-red in colour, with brown legs and scapes, and a black gaster. The whole of the head and thorax is a bright mahogany red, while the mandibles are shaded with brown. The hair is yellow, moderately long, erect and found all over the body, but the hairs are shorter on the legs and absent on the antennae. The pubescence (soft short hair) is confined to the clypeus. The queen shares the same colour variation, body sculpture and pilosity of a worker, but they are usually larger. Queens show reduced thoracic development, and Clark described them as \\"subapterous\\", suggesting that wings are present in the females as undifferentiated wing buds. However, queens collected from Manjimup bore well developed wings. The head, epinotum, mesonotum and pronotum are finely striate-rugose. The head is as long as it is broad with a straight occipital border. The mandibles are slightly shorter than the head with a concave border. The pronotum is broader than its total length by one-third and the mesonotum is broader by one-sixth, being almost circular in shape and clearly convex. The epinotum is also broader, but only slightly. The gaster is slightly broader, and the postpetiole is one-fifth broader than long. The scutellum is oval and almost twice as broad as long. Male specimens have been rarely collected, and those that are available are too badly damaged for a proper examination. However, the colour and pilosity of male and worker specimens show little differentiation. The heads of the workers and queens are as long as broad with convexed sides. The mandibles are long with thirteen known teeth. The first and third segments of the funiculus are equally long. The thorax is longer than broad by two to three-fourths its width, and the mesonotum is longer than it is broad in workers; the mesonotum is broader than it is long in queens. The node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster) is as long as it is broad, and the postpetiole is one-sixth broader than long. The first segment of the gaster is broader than its length. M. regularis shares a similar appearance to M. forficata, but there are several morphological differences that separate the two. Owing to the rugose sculpture of the head and thorax, M. regularis is noticeably smaller than M. forficata. The mandibles of M. regularis are much narrower, the posterior corners of the head are more round and the petiolar peduncle is longer. The mandibles appear to be deep red, and some areas, such as the gastric segments, are golden brown. Distribution and habitat M. regularis is found in the south-western coastal regions of Australia. Nests have been recorded in the towns of Albany, Denmark, Nornalup, Manjimup, Pemberton and around the Margaret River in south Western Australia, Kangaroo Island in South Australia and Portland in Victoria. The ant prefers to inhabit a variety of rural environments, including woodland, open forests, dry marri forests, tree heath and granite mountains. In particular, it is a dominant species in Eucalyptus woodland, especially when E. diversicolor, E. gomphocephala and E. marginata trees are present. M. regularis colonies do not form mounds, but rather nest in damp, black soil or under large stones and logs with 100 to 200 workers present. These colonies are usually found at altitudes of between above sea level. Excavated incipient nests (young colonies beginning to develop) show small chambers wide, where logs and stones form the roof of the cell. The ground is flat with walls continuous on all sides; the outer walls tend to be thin, as they are situated near the edges of a log or stone. Most nests have a gallery which descends further into the ground, usually around and forms a small and more irregular chamber. Behaviour and ecology M. regularis is a highly aggressive ant that will pursue any intruder to a distance of 1.8‚Äì2.7 metres (2‚Äì3 yards) if their nests are disturbed. Their stings are very painful and particularly powerful. In some cases, human victims of M. regularis bites have displayed an allergy to the venom. In a 2011 study which investigated the causes of ant sting anaphylaxis in Australia, 265 of the 376 human participants reacted to the sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, nine serum samples taken from patients were IgE positive to the venom of M. regularis. These ants are both diurnal and nocturnal, foraging on the trunks of Eucalyptus trees to feed on sap and nectar, or capturing small insects (such as caterpillars and ants in the genus Camponotus or subgenus Orthocrema). The larvae are carnivorous and exclusively feed on insects, either consuming small portions of the insect or all of it. Unlike most Myrmecia species, trophallaxis takes place among adults or between adults and larvae. All stages of the frog Metacrinia nichollsi are known to dwell inside M. regularis colonies, where they use several galleries constructed by the ants. The parasitic ant M. inquilina may attempt to enter M. regularis nests to establish colonies, but M. inquilina queens may be seized and killed as soon as the two species come into contact. Observations show that nuptial flight does not occur before February. This is based on larvae spinning into cocoons by November, and by January, these cocoons could not produce adult workers or reproductive males and females. Queens are most likely fertilised by males sometime between February and April; however, scientists have seen alates engage in nuptial flight during March. Before emerging from their parent nest, queens will shed their wings inside the nest and mate with low- flying males nearby. After nuptial flight, a queen will isolate herself and form a small chamber underground, where she remains for seven to eight months. However, it is improbable that a queen can survive on her own storage of fat and wing-musculature for that long. During this time, the queen may emerge from her nest occasionally, but she will only lay eggs from October to November when there is a rich supply of food. While this may be the case, some queens will lay eggs after a month of isolation during winter. M. regularis is a semi-clasutral ant, meaning that a queen will go out and forage in order to feed her young. Queens will emerge from their nests from time to time, during which they will capture insects for their young or feed on sweet substances. If food sources are deprived, a queen will only rely on her fat to feed the larvae until she perishes or finds food, but the larvae will not be cannibalised, and remain alive until a week after the queen's death. An individual ant may take eight months to develop from an egg to an adult.

He was announced on January 13, 2014 as the first official mascot in the modern history of the Cubs franchise. He was introduced that day at the Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center's pediatric developmental center along with some of the Cubs' top prospects such as number one draft pick Kris Bryant and Albert Almora, Jorge Soler, Mike Olt and Eric Jokisch. Over a dozen Cubs prospects were attending the Cubs' Rookie Development Program that week. The Cubs become the 27th team in Major League Baseball to have a mascot, leaving the Los Angeles Angels, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees as the remaining franchises without mascots. According to the Cubs' press release, Clark is a response to fan demands (expressed via surveys and interviews) for more kid-friendly elements at Wrigley Field Cubs games to keep pace with games in other cities that have more to offer youth fans. Description He is a \\"young, friendly Cub\\" who will wear a backwards baseball cap and greet fans entering Wrigley Field, which is located at the corner of Clark Street (for which he is named) and Addison Street. North Clark Street borders the third base side of Wrigley Field. According to the Cubs, the fictional character Clark is descended from Joa, the franchise's original live Bears mascot in 1916. Clark can be seen in events through Chicago, especially in the northern part of the city which is the home district of the team, wearing home or batting practice uniforms with brown pants. For the 2018 Players' Weekend, he was given a special uniform similar to those wore by the team during the weekend with his Twitter handle on the back of his jersey. The tradition carried on through the 2019 season, in which Clark wore home whites for the weekend together with the Cubs players, previously he wore a special uniform during the 2019 Little League World Series Classic which the Cubs played.

Among the victims was Edward Haughey, Baron Ballyedmond. The subsequent investigation concluded that the flight crew may have been subject to somatogravic illusion due to the lack of external visual cues, inducing them to manoeuvre the aircraft into the ground instead of climbing away. Accident The aircraft crashed at about 19:26 hrs UTC, shortly after taking off from Gillingham Hall, Gillingham, Norfolk, for Rostrevor, County Down, via Coventry Airport. An eyewitness to the accident stated that the helicopter came down at a 45¬∞ angle. The front of the aircraft was severely damaged in the crash. The location was at Ordnance Survey Grid Reference . At the time of the accident, weather conditions were foggy. All four people on board were killed; both crew and both passengers. Lord Ballyedmond was one of the passengers. The bodies of the victims were removed from the wreckage during the afternoon of 14 March. The Norfolk Constabulary asked the Police Service of Northern Ireland for assistance with their investigations into the accident. Norbrook Laboratories, owned by Lord Ballyedmond, was also assisting the police with their enquiries. The site was formally handed over to Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) investigators on 14 March. The Norfolk police stated that they were satisfied that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the accident. On 15 March, investigators dismantled the remains of the rotor blades and removed the tail of the aircraft in preparation for the removal of the wreck. The fuselage of the helicopter was loaded onto a lorry that day. It was taken to the AAIBs headquarters at Farnborough, Hampshire on 16 March. The AAIBs field investigators were assisted by personnel from the Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy. Following the accident, the police closed a number of roads around the crash site. The last road closure was lifted at 09:25 on 17 March. Aircraft The accident aircraft was an AgustaWestland AW139, msn 31421, registration G-LBAL. The aircraft was built in Italy in 2012 and registered in the United Kingdom to Haughey Air on 18 September 2012. Haughey Air was owned by Edward Haughey, Baron Ballyedmond. It was the sole aircraft purchased from AgustaWestland by Haughey Air. Lord Ballyedmond had initiated legal proceedings in September 2013 against AgustaWestland over safety concerns relating to oil leaks and rotor blade issues, as well as problems with the aircraft's communication and navigation systems. Investigation The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) opened an investigation into the accident. AgustaWestland assisted the AAIB in their enquiries. The aircraft's data recorders were recovered from the wreckage on 15 March 2014. A Special Bulletin published by the AAIB on 4 April revealed that there had been no mechanical failure with the helicopter and that it had not contacted any object between taking off and the crash site. The final report into the accident was originally scheduled to be published around March 2015. It was published on 8 October 2015. The investigation found that there was no mechanical failure with the aircraft. The crew were found not to have used checklists when operating the helicopter. The cause of the accident was pilot error, with spatial disorientation due to somatogravic illusion a major factor. An inquest into the deaths of the four victims was opened on 20 March at Norwich Coroner's Court. After hearing that all four people died from head and chest injuries sustained in the accident, the inquest was adjourned until 24 July. The inquests concluded in January 2016, with verdicts of accidental death being returned against all four victims. During the inquest, the Coroner demanded that the AAIB release to her the recordings from the Cockpit Voice Recorder, imposing two fines of ¬£100 each on the Chief Inspector of Accidents at the AAIB. The matter was referred to the High Court, where it was stated that only the High Court had the power to demand such disclosure of evidence. The fines were overturned.

The expansion plan was funded by loans from both Indian and overseas financial institutions. With the demand for denim slowing, the company found it difficult to repay the loans, resulting in an increased interest burden on the loans. In the late 1990s, the company encountered financial problems due of its debt burden, resulting in incurring significant losses. The company came up with a debt-restructuring plan for the long-term debts being taken up in February 2001. This complex financial restructuring exercise, which involved several domestic and international lenders, is considered to be the benchmark and a case study in India. The restructuring was overseen by Jayesh Shah, CFO, and advised on by a JP Morgan Hong Kong team, led by Ahmad Ayaz. In 2018, Arvind Ltd. demerged its branded apparel and engineering business into separate entities for enhanced focus and value addition for the shareholders of the Company. It got the nod from NCLT Ahmedabad bench for demerger in Oct 2018. Arvind Fashions, the branded apparel entity, will be scaling up existing brand portfolio and improve profitability across brands. Anveshan Heavy Engineering, earlier known as Anup Engineering, has laid down capex plans of ‚Çπ80 crore to double existing fabrication capacity of 15,000 tonnes per annum by implementing product mix.

He followed his father Gazi II Giray, was rejected by the Turks and killed by his successor Sel√¢met I Giray. In 1602, when Gazi left on his third Hungarian campaign, he appointed his 13-year-old son Tokhtamysh as kalga and left him in nominal charge of Crimea. After he returned to Crimea in 1603 he sent Tokhtamysh with some troops back to Hungary. Gazi died in 1607. By custom, when a khan died power passed to his eldest surviving brother and then to his son. The clan leaders declaired the new khan and then requested confirmation from the Ottoman sultan, who sometimes made another choice. Gazi‚Äôs only living brother was the 50-year-old Selyamet who was imprisoned in Turkey. Gazi had made Tokhtamysh his kalga or designated successor. Further, sultan Murad III (1574‚Äì1595) had promised that the khanship would go to his son, as was the Ottoman custom. The elders chose the 19-year-old Tokhtamysh and sent to Istanbul for confirmation. Sultan Ahmed I hesitated. His father Mehmed III (1595‚Äì1605) had found Gazi to be a good warrior, but hard to control and thought that his son might also be disobedient. His advisors suggested Selyamet as an alternative. In April 1608 Selyamet was taken from prison and declared khan. Mehmed, son of Saadet II Giray would be his kalga. When Tokhtamysh heard of his disposition he set out overland to talk to the sultan. While crossing the Southern Bug he met Mehmed and a group of janissaries who were going overland to Crimea. His outnumbered retinue fled and Tokhtamysh died fighting along with his brother kalga Sefer Giray. Meanwhile Selyamet arrived by ship in Crimea, was recognized by the beys and went to Bakhchisarai. Mehmed soon arrived with news of Tokhtamysh‚Äôs death.

Their first two singles released in 1969-1970, \\"Heya\\" and \\"Na Na Hey Hey\\", became hits in several European countries. In 1970 Jeronimo toured successfully through Germany with Steppenwolf. The same they performed at the legendary Progressive Pop Festival in Cologne. Following that, Jeronimo shared the headlines with such groups as Deep Purple and Golden Earring at various European open-air festivals.

His early life was more complex than his 2-year reign. Most of his life involved dynastic conflicts with his brothers and nephews. Family All subsequent Crimean khans were descended from Selyamet, except for five who were sons or grandsons of his brothers. Selyamet was the youngest of the many sons of Devlet I Giray (1551‚Äì1577). His brothers were khans Mehmed II Giray (1577‚Äì1584, killed by Islyam), Islyam II Giray (1584‚Äì1588, died naturally), Gazi II Giray (1588‚Äì1607, followed by Selyamet) and Fetih I Giray (1596, interrupting Gazi II) and Alp, Shakai Mubarek and five others who died early. When he came to the throne he was the last surviving brother, so he had to deal with his nephews and their sons. These were, starting with Selyamet's brothers: Mehmed II (sons Murad, Safa, Saadet II Giray [sons Kumyk, Devlet, Mehmed III Giray and Shahin]), Gazi II (son Toqtamƒ±≈ü Giray), Shakai Mubarak (sons Canibek Giray and Devlet). Early Life 1577‚Äì1584 under Mehmed II Giray: After 1578 Alp Giray quarreled with Mehmed. Alp and the young Selyamet fled to the steppes and were captured by the Cossacks. They were later released and returned to Crimea. Gaivoronsky, p306. The Russian wikipedia, under Mehmed II, citing the 2007 edition of Gaivoronsky, p. 284, has the brothers leave the Cossacks and accompany the Polish ambassador to Istanbul, where they gained Turkish support. The Russian wikipedia, under Alp Giray, citing no sources, says that in 1578 Alp and Mehmed quarreled and were reconciled, in 1581 the brothers fled and in the spring of 1582 they went to Turkey and soon returned to Crimea. In 1584 a Turkish fleet arrived intending to replace Mehmed with Islyam. The brothers Selyamet, Alp, and Mubarak supported Islyam and Mehmed was killed by Alp. 1584‚Äì1588 under Islyam II Giray: Little information. 1588‚Äì1607 under Gazi II Giray: When Gazi was placed on the throne by the Turks the brothers Alp and Mubarak fled. Selyamet and Fetih joined Gazi. Selyamet became kalga even though he had supported Alp. In June 1588 Safa bin Mehmed returned. Selaymet, who had been involved in Mehmed's death, quarreled with Safa and fled to Kaffa where he was protected by the Turks. Fetih became kalga. By 1601 Selyamet was back in Crimea. In 1601 he was accused of being involved in Devlet bin Murad‚Äôs rebellion and fled to Akkerman. Gazi demanded his extradition. The sultan refused, but exiled him to Anatolia. Selyamet joined the Celali rebellions. After their defeat he spent the next seven years imprisoned in the Yedikule Fortress. Reign When Gazi died in 1607 the khanship went to his son Tokhtamysh, as was Gazi‚Äôs wish. The Turks rejected this, released Selyamet from jail and made him khan (April 1608). Our sources do not explain why the Turks chose a person with such an irregular history. His kalga was Mehmed bin Saadet. By the time Selyamet arrived in Bakhchisarai, Mehmed had killed Tokhtamysh. Mehmed's brother Shahin Giray arrived from Circassia and was made nureddin. Dur-Bike, the widow of Mubarak, who died in Circassia, arrived with her sons Jannibek and Devlet. Selyamet married Dur-Bike and adopted her sons. In 1609 Mehmed and Shahin conspired against Selyamet and were forced to flee from Crimea to Budjak. Jannibek and Devlet became kalga and nureddin. In 1609 and 1610 Jannibek led significant raids against Muscovy and twice crossed the Oka. In late May or early June 1610 the 52-year-old Selyamet died. He was buried in Bakhchisarai. His sons All subsequent khans were descended from Selyamet or his brothers. Selyamet was one of the many sons of Devlet I (1550‚Äì1577). Of his seven sons, three were khans and four were fathers of khans. His sons were khans Bahadƒ±r I Giray (1637‚Äì1641), Mehmed IV Giray (1641‚Äì1644, 1654‚Äì1666), and ƒ∞sl√¢m III Giray (1644‚Äì1654) and Kyrym, Mubarak, Safa and Adil. Kyrym's sons were Hacƒ± II Giray (1683‚Äì84) and Saadet III Giray (1691). Mubarak was the father of Murad Giray. Safa was the father of Safa Giray (1691‚Äì92). Adil was the father of Devlet III Giray (1716‚Äì17). After these all khans were descended from Selyamet's son son Bahadir I.

The book was published in 1993 by The New Press. Heins provides an overview of the history of censorship, including the 1873 Comstock laws, and then moves on to more topical case studies of attempts at suppression of free expression. The book argues that artists have been scapegoated by those advocating censorship, as a method of deflecting debate away from the suppression of human rights. The author asserts that censorship of works deemed obscene has been used as a tactic throughout history to suppress women's rights. Heins argues that even if the perceived negative impacts of pornography, hip hop music, and violent films were factually accurate (and she asserts they are not), the ends would not justify the means of degrading the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She emphasizes that education should be used to help guard against potentially dangerous notions, instead of censorship and suppression of dissent. Background Marjorie Heins at an event for the National Coalition Against Censorship in 2009 Marjorie Heins is an attorney with a focus on civil liberties. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Cornell University in 1967. Heins graduated from Harvard Law School with a magna cum laude distinction, receiving her juris doctor degree in 1978. At the time of the book's publication in 1993, Heins served as the founding director and chief lawyer for the Arts Censorship Project. The project was formed as a division of the American Civil Liberties Union in 1991 during societal conflict in the U.S. over attempts to decrease financing for the National Endowment for the Arts, and to censor the musicians 2 Live Crew. In 2000, Heins became the founding director of the Free Expression Policy Project at the National Coalition Against Censorship. Her published books prior to Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy include: Strictly Ghetto Property: The Story of Los Siete de la Raza (1972), and Cutting the Mustard: Affirmative Action and the Nature of Excellence (1987). Subsequent to the publication of Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy, Heins wrote Not in Front of the Children: \\"Indecency,\\" Censorship, and the Innocence of Youth in 2001, which received the 2002 Eli M. Oboler Award from the American Library Association; and Priests of Our Democracy: The Supreme Court, Academic Freedom, and the Anti-Communist Purge in 2013, which received the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award. Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy: A Guide to America's Censorship Wars was first published in 1993 by The New Press. The book was re-published by The New Press in 1998. It's stated that in September 1993, \\"Heins was the featured speaker at two events at the fifth annual Uncensored Celebration, sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Oregon, where she spoke about her book and her work for the Arts Censorship Project\\". She was a special guest at the Free Speech Lunch on September 18, 1993, as part of the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association's Trade Show Northwest. On October 6, 1993, the Newark, New Jersey art gallery Aljira, a Center for Contemporary Art held a reception in honor of Heins' work where she spoke about her book and her efforts to defend works of art from censorship. Content summary Anthony Comstock (circa 1913) Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy provides the reader with a history of censorship of artworks. The book argues that artists have been scapegoated by those advocating censorship, as a method of diverting debate away from the suppression of human rights. The author asserts that censorship of works deemed obscene has been used as a tactic throughout history to suppress women's rights. Heins describes for the reader the history of the 1873 Comstock laws. It's stated that,\\"such laws were put forth by United States Postal Inspection Service inspector Anthony Comstock, and after he helped influence passage of the legislation, they enabled the government to criminalize sending perceived immoral writings through the mail\\". The book discusses the history of the division of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) that assigns movie ratings, the Classification and Rating Administration. Heins quotes New York Supreme Court Judge Charles Ramos, who observed that film directors have since learned to style their movies in such a way as to receive certain ratings from the MPAA. The book focuses on the negative and political impacts of censorship. Censorship can be confusing, and many seem to not know what it is, or why it is used. Censorship is defined as \\"The suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security.\\" (English Oxford Living Dictionaries). Censorship, the suppression of words, images, or ideas that are \\"offensive,\\" happens whenever one or more people succeed in imposing their personal political or moral values on others.\\" (ACLU) This article points to the importance of the First Amendment rights when, particular with regards to government involvement. \\"Censorship can be carried out by the government as well as private pressure groups. Censorship by the government is unconstitutional.\\" (ACLU) Censorship has, to many people, gotten out of hand, and takes away from our First Amendment right of Freedom of Speech. \\"The question, therefore, is not whether we ought to have constraints on speech but what kinds of constraints?\\" (Huffpost). An argument of constraints is just an argument in itself. Peoples' views on constraints can vary from personal opinions, to personal exposures and experiences. The book focuses on fear being the tool for censorship. The second principle is that expression may be restricted only if it will clearly cause direct and imminent harm to an important societal interest. The classic example is falsely shouting fire in a crowded theater and causing a stampede. \\"Even then, the speech may be silenced or punished only if there is no other way to avert the harm\\" (ACLU). Using fear to censor works for many people and families, putting fear in parents, and using their children as a reason to censor books in their school library or in the classrooms, historical lessons that are deemed too violent, etc, all to censor or shelter their children. Censorship is used to ban things that not only are viewed as offensive, but can be viewed as offensive or indecent by certain people. It essentially is able to jump the gun to protect us, assuming we will be offended. Heins recounts how the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) advocated for its associated organizations to add Parental Advisory warnings on labels of music albums as a way to advise parents about possible offensive content. She describes how the Parents Music Resource Center, co-founded by Tipper Gore, and hearings held by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, which included Senator Al Gore, led to attempts at censorship by lawmakers in eight individual states. Heins suggests that this subsequently led to the industry's self-regulation, which the author sees as self-censorship, and blacklisting of certain albums by music stores. Andres Serrano (2005) Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy provides the reader with what the author (and many others) consider case studies of censorship in the U.S., including a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States against naked erotic dancing, laws against pornography in the 1980s supported by proponents Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, and attempts by the Meese Commission to discourage proprietors from selling Penthouse and Playboy magazines. Formally known as the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, it was colloquially called the Meese Report, because the people on the Commission were selected by then-Attorney General of the United States Edwin Meese. Released in 1986, the Meese Report demanded U.S. citizens protest pornography because of its asserted harmful impact to women and children. It is docummented \\"The book criticizes controversy generated by politicians against the National Endowment for the Arts, over the organization's support of photography by Robert Mapplethorpe and the work, \\"Piss Christ\\", by Andres Serrano. Heins argues that even if the perceived negative impacts of pornography, hip hop music, and violent films were factually accurate (and she asserts they are not), the ends would not justify the means of degrading the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She emphasizes that education should be used to help guard against potentially dangerous notions, instead of censorship and suppression of dissent. The author concludes, \\"A free society is based on the principle that [individuals have] a right to decide on what art or entertainment (they want) to receive ‚Äì or create.\\" Reception Women's Review of Books commented, \\"Heins writes with intelligence, clarity, humor and refusal of cant. She is especially skilled at explaining legal concepts, reminding us of the elegance of a good legal argument.\\" The review found that by focusing on lawsuits and court battles, the book was lacking in individual stories and people central to the censorship fights. The News & Observer wrote, \\"The book is as much a call to action as it is a catalog of repression.\\" In its review of the book, the San Francisco Chronicle emphasized that readers should pay attention to the author's warnings about the dangers of censorship. The Gazette observed, \\"Throughout the book, whether discussing attempts to censor rap music or pornography, Heins attempts to communicate the radical differences between the limits of American law and America's seemingly endless social problems. She concludes that they do not and cannot mix. The best defense, it would seem, to any form of speech that offends, is a good offense: more speech, not restrictive and oppressive laws and pressures.\\" American Book Review was critical, writing: \\"Overall, Heins's guide to the censorship wars is biased and woefully superficial ... I do not find her arguments for free-speech absolutism either logically or legally compelling.\\" The review concluded, \\"There may be good reasons for tolerating the public display of gross and disgusting art, but the First Amendment itself does not provide one.\\" See also * Censorship in the United States * Film censorship in the United States * Freedom of speech in the United States * Freedom of the press * Think of the children * United States obscenity law References Further reading   ;Book reviews   External links * FEPP: Marjorie Heins bio * NYU: Marjorie Heins * NYU Press: Authors ‚Äì Heins, Marjorie Category:1993 non-fiction books Category:Books about freedom of speech Category:First Amendment to the United States Constitution Category:History of civil rights in the United States Category:Books about United States legal history Category:Obscenity law Category:Obscenity controversies in literature ","title":"Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy"},{"id":"42200166","text":"Fetih I Giray (c. 1558‚Äì1597, reigned 1596‚Äì97) was briefly khan of the Crimean Khanate, interrupting the reign of his elder brother ƒûazƒ± II Giray (1588‚Äì1607). He was one of the many sons of Devlet I Giray. Khan Adil Giray (1666‚Äì1671) was his grandson. When Gazi II became khan in 1588 Fetih was appointed Kalga. In 1592 he led a very successful raid south of the Oka River. War in Hungary: During the Long Turkish War, Gazi fought in the Balkans in the Turkish service (1594‚Äì95). What Fetih did at this time does not seem to be recorded. In 1596 Gazi and Fetih set off for another campaign in Hungary. Gazi split his forces and remained in Wallachia to deal with some rebels and sent Fetih with 20000 men to Hungary where he met Sultan Murad III for the first time. Fetih went with Murad to the Siege of Eger (1596) in northeast Hungary. According to Gaivoronsky (?Gaivoronsky, p359. Turk, p45 has the Tatars attack the rear of the Austrian fortification, allowing Chigalazade to attack from the front. Battle of Keresztes gives a very different account), after the place was taken, in October 1596 a large Habsburg army appeared and almost reached the Sultan's tent when Fetih and Cƒ±ƒüalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha attacked them in the rear. The Austrians faced around and this allowed the Turks to defeat them. As a reward Chigalazade was made grand vizier and Fetih was appointed khan of Crimea in place of Gazi. This was toward the end of 1596. Reign and death: Several reasons have been given for Gazi's deposition. Gazi's friend and protector, Sultan Murad III died in January 1595. Gazi had suggested putting his relatives on the thrones of Moldavia or Wallachia, which seemed like a dangerous extension of Crimean power. Gazi's failure to report to Murad in 1596 looked like disobedience. Chigalazade seems to have had a personal hostility to Gazi, going back to 1585 when both were fighting the Persians. Fetih at first protested, or pretended to. Gazi was back in Crimea when he heard of his disposition. According to Gaivoronsky he began intriguing with all the neighboring powers - Poles, Austrians, Moldavians, Wallachians and Zaporozhians. According to T√ºrk he sent a letter of protest to the Sultan Turk, p. 48; Gaivoronsky, p. 360. After 45 days as grand vizier, Chigalazade was replaced by Damat Ibrahim Pasha who recommended that Gazi be restored. This was a problem for the Sultan since any conflict in Crimea would deprive him of troops he needed in Hungary. He solved the problem by sending Handan Agha to Crimea with two letters of appointment ‚Äì one for Fetih and one for Gazi. He was told to decide which man had the most support and give him the letter. The problem was that Handan was a friend of Gazi's. He chose Gazi and burned Fetih's letter. The next problem was that Fetih had another letter of appointment. The letters were presented to the Kadi at Kaffa and he chose Fetih's on the ground that it had the sultan's signature. Gazi appealed to the Mufti. The Mufti preferred Gazi's letter because it had the sultans ‚Äò‚Äô ‚Äì a piece of calligraphy that amounted to a seal. The Mufti outranked the Kadi, so Fetih had lost.From here to Fetih's death following Gaivoronsky. T√ºrk omits this section and says that Fetih planned to go to Istanbul, but chose to visit his brother first. The Sultan invited him to Istanbul. On learning, or guessing, that the Sultan planned to execute him, he fled to his Circassian father-in-law. (His Circassian wife was the former wife of his brother Mubarak.) There was some talk of him going over to the Russians, as his nephew Murad Giray had done. This was some time in the first half in 1597. In the summer of 1597 Gazi led his troops to the steppes north of Crimea.Gaivoronsky does not explain why. Perhaps he was planning to deal with the Zaporozhians. Fetih assumed that he was starting another Hungarian campaign, so he invaded Crimea. Gazi returned and drove him out. Fetih decided to submit. In Gazi's tent outside of Kaffa, while kneeling before Gazi to make submission, one of the MansurGaivoronsky, page 363 has Mansur, T√ºrk, page 55 has Mangit. Mirzas stepped forward with a battle ax and bashed his head in. Baht Giray fled on horseback, but was caught and killed (Baht Giray was Fetih's kalga and the son of the Adil Geray who was executed by the Persians in 1579). Following this Fetih's whole family was killed, including his nine children.How khan Adil Giray could have been his grandson is not explained. Some have claimed that Gazi did not give the order, but this seems unlikely.

It is a Palm Sunday hymn, based on Matthew 21:1‚Äì11 and the occasion of Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem.  History  Theodulf became the Bishop of Orl√©ans under Charlemagne. When Charlemagne died and Louis the Pious became the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, Theodulf was removed from the bishopric and placed under house arrest at a monastery in Angers during the power struggle following Louis' ascension, mostly due to his opposition to icons and Louis' suspicion that Theodulf supported an Italian rival to the throne. During his arrest, Theodulf wrote \\"Gloria, laus et honor\\" for Palm Sunday. Although likely apocryphal, a 16th- century story asserted that Louis heard Theodulf sing \\"Gloria, laus et honor\\" one Palm Sunday, and was so inspired that he released Theodulf and ordered that the hymn be sung thereafter on every Palm Sunday. A translation into Middle English was effected by William Herebert: \\"Wele, herying and worshipe be to Christ that dere ous boughte,/ To wham gradden 'Osanna' children clene of thoughte.\\" In 1851, John Mason Neale translated the hymn from Latin into English to be published in his Medieval Hymns and Sequences. Neale revised his translation in 1854 and revised it further in 1861 when it was published in the first edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern. The hymn was originally made of thirty-nine verses however only the first twelve lines were sung since a ninth-century published manuscript attributed to St. Gall until Neale's translation. The original Latin words are used by Roman Catholics alongside the English translation. Text Neale's hymn appears as Number 86 in Hymns Ancient & Modern in a version with six stanzas, using the first four lines as the refrain, which is repeated between each stanza.

This species is distributed across the North Pacific region of the United States, as well as in parts of North Africa, Europe, and the Mediterranean. It is considered a common household spider, and builds its nest in attics, basements, and eaves of houses. Although some members of the species live in solitary webs, the majority join already existing webs and migrate to new webs multiple times throughout the course of their lives. In many species of spiders, stridulation commonly occurs by males during sexual encounters; in H. pluchei, females also possess stridulatory organs, and both sexes engage in stridulation.  Description  Males and females of the species are approximately the same size, with males ranging between 5-7 mm and females ranging between 5-7.5 mm. H. pluchei have long fragile legs with black and white circles around the joints. Immature members of the species resemble adults. Females have swollen palps that resemble the palp of a male before his final molt. Females also possess a sternum projection, which is thought to play an important role in mate selection by improving females‚Äô control over copulation. Both females and males possess stridulatory organs of the type where the pedipalp rubs against the chelicera, and no morphological differences in these organs have been observed between the sexes.  Phylogeny  Holocnemus pluchei ‚Äì Museum specimen H. pluchei belongs to the family Pholcidae, which contains over 1800 species, including multiple types of daddy long-legs. Within, this family, H. pluchei belongs to the genus Holocnemus, which contains just two other species, H. caudatus, found in Spain and Sicily, and H. hispanicus, found in Spain.  Habitat and Distribution  The marbled cellar spider is native to the Mediterranean area of Europe and Northern Africa, and was thought to be introduced to the North Pacific region of the United States in the mid-1900s. It is now commonly found in Southern California, and has become an urban pest, often building its web under rocks, in basements, or on walls of buildings.  Diet  H. pluchei prey on various species of insects, including fruit flies, houseflies, and damselflies. Some members of the species live in groups, and although this comes with the cost of decreased food per spider, it also allows each spider to expend less energy in producing silk for the web. In a group setting, size is a determinant of prey consumption, as the largest spider that detected the prey is observed to win the prey about 80% of the time. Because food is limited in a natural habitat, increased food level significantly decreases development time of the spider from egg to adult, and increases size, especially in males. This allows larger males to have a competitive advantage when stealing food from females‚Äô webs. For females, however, the extra molt that they sometimes undergo when the food supply is low increases their size. Since larger individuals will often steal food from smaller individuals, this gives females that were raised under low-food conditions a competitive advantage.  Webs  Some spiders of this species live in solitary while others live in group webs, and this decision is made when they are 4-5 days old and must decide whether to build their own web or join a group web. Each strategy has its own costs and benefits, as group living decreases the amount of food allocated to each spider but also decreases the amount of silk each spider must produce. Spiders in groups tend to have smaller abdomens than those living alone, indicating lower foraging success. However, spiders are more often found to be living in groups than would be predicted by chance, likely due to the high energetic cost of producing silk and the much larger amount that is needed to build a web alone than with a group. The decision that the spider makes to build its own web or join a group web will be based on its level of recent feeding success. H. pluchei move to new webs frequently throughout their lifespan, making it more difficult to follow an individual over the course of its life.  Reproduction and Life Cycle  = Fertilization = During fertilization, the female‚Äôs projecting sternum interacts with the male‚Äôs clypeus specifically during sperm transfer, indicating that rather than having a stridulatory purpose, the female‚Äôs sternum instead plays a role in sexual selection. It is hypothesized that this interaction allows the female to exert some level of control over the copulatory actions of the male, since contact is specifically observed when the male exerts genital pressure on the female during sperm transfer. From this, it can be hypothesized that the projecting sternum puts selective pressure on the males, allowing females to mate with only those males who are still able to transfer sperm given the constraints placed on them by this mating filter. It has also been observed that females tend to mate multiple times, and the second male will have a higher likelihood of reproductive success, fertilizing 65-82% of the female‚Äôs eggs. Once fertilized, the female carries the egg sac in her fangs while waiting for the spiderlings to hatch. Females do not feed during this time, and instead devote their energy to guarding the egg sac from predators. = Brood Size = Each brood contains approximately 50 spiderlings, and although it is difficult to follow individuals in the field due to web migration, females have occasionally been observed to produce multiple clutches over their lifetime, sometimes as soon as two months after the successful hatching of the first brood. = Molting = During development, spiderlings normally undergo five molts, with females more likely to undergo a sixth molt than males and poorly fed individuals more likely to undergo a sixth molt than well-fed individuals. = Lifespan = Although the lifespan of H. pluchei has been difficult to track due to web migration, individuals raised in the lab can have a lifespan of up to one year. Males‚Äô lifespan in a natural habitat is often terminated prematurely by various environmental conditions, so a faster rate of development leads to a higher rate of reproductive success.  Mating  = Stridulations = Unlike in many other species of spiders, both males and females of H. pluchei possess stridulatory organs, with the females possessing comparatively thick pedipalp segments. Stridulations in males of many spider species are known to play a role in courtship, and although H. pluchei female stridulations also play a role in courtship, they are hypothesized to serve the purpose of aggressive or preventative behavior. When females copulate with males immediately and willingly, they do not stridulate; stridulation has only been observed in cases where the female is less receptive towards the male‚Äôs advances, often leading to an unsuccessful mating attempt by the male. Females can also regulate mate choice through their sternum projections, which serve as filters by limiting male success during sperm transfer. = Male/Female Feeding Interactions = Although other species in the family Pholcidae exhibit ‚Äúchivalrous‚Äù behavior, in which the male will step aside to cede prey to the female or wrap up the prey and bring it to her, this behavior is not observed in H. pluchei. In contrast, males of H. pluchei often enter females‚Äô webs for the purpose of aggressively stealing food. In competitive interactions over prey, males tend to lose interactions only when they are smaller than their competitor, indicating a lack of chivalrous behavior on the part of the male. In addition, no wrapping or exchanging of the prey has been observed. For males in other species of Pholcidae, chivalrous behavior may induce a female to mate, thereby increasing the male‚Äôs reproductive success. Since the first male that mates with the female H. pluchei is unlikely to be the one to fertilize her eggs, there may not be as much advantage to him engaging in chivalrous behavior, and this may be the reason it has not been observed.  Social Behavior  = Group Living = Spiderlings can choose to join a group web or build their own web, with the majority of individuals choosing to live in a group. Spiderlings within group webs produce less silk than those in solitary webs, showcasing the benefit of group living that occurs from less energy expenditure on producing silk. However, H. pluchei spiderlings co- inhabiting a web do not cooperate in other realms, such as prey capture or wrapping remainders of prey in silk, and instead engage in display and fighting behaviors as they compete for prey, with larger spiders tending to win these fights. These conflicts can sometimes escalate to death, especially when the spiders are of similar sizes. Spiders in the same web will occasionally cooperate on wrapping prey, but only when the prey is very large, indicating that this cooperation may be occurring only because the spiders cannot see each other and are therefore unaware of each other‚Äôs presence.  Enemies  = Predators = H. pluchei are preyed upon by jumping spiders of the family Salticidae, including Portia fimbriata and Portia labiata. In response to invasions from other species, H. pluchei will ‚Äúbounce‚Äù, or move their legs rapidly up and down while remaining grounded on the web in an attempt to dislodge the intruder. Invading species employ aggressive mimicry tactics when invading the webs of H. pluchei, and are often able to avoid setting off the resident‚Äôs ‚Äúbouncing‚Äù strategy, enabling these web invaders to successfully capture their prey.  Interactions with Humans and Livestock  H. pluchei are considered household spiders, and build webs in the eaves, basements, and attics of houses. Although they are venomous, they are not dangerous to humans, likely due to the inability of their fangs to produce a strong enough bite. There has been one case study reported of asthma in a human stemming from an allergy associated with the arginine kinase stretch of a protein within H. pluchei, but no other evidence of harm to humans from this species has been documented.

Many Egyptologists assign Nebkaure to the 9th Dynasty, possibly the fourth king (and the second king bearing the name Khety), just after Neferkare.William C. Hayes, in The Cambridge Ancient History, vol 1, part 2, 1971 (2008), Cambridge University Press, , p. 465.Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, Oxford, Blackwell Books, 1992, p. 140.Michael Rice, Who is who in Ancient Egypt, 1999 (2004), Routledge, London, , pp. 5-6. On the other hand, other scholars such as J√ºrgen von Beckerath believe instead that Nebkaure reigned during the subsequent 10th Dynasty, possibly before Meryibre Khety.J√ºrgen von Beckerath, Handbuch der √Ñgyptischen K√∂nigsnamen, 2nd edition, Mainz, 1999, p. 74. Attestations Like many of the kings who preceded or succeeded him, attestations of Nebkaure Khety are scant. On the Turin King List he was tentatively placed in the register 4.21. The only contemporary object bearing his cartouche is a weight made from red jasper which was unearthed by Flinders Petrie at Tell el- Retabah, a location along the Wadi Tumilat in the eastern Delta; this weight is now exhibited at the Petrie Museum (UC11782).Nebkaure's weight UC11782 in the Petrie MuseumAlan Gardiner, Egypt of the Pharaohs. An introduction, Oxford University Press, 1961, p. 112.

He was appointed captain in Boston in 1747 and sent to defend Annapolis along with Jedidiah Preble and Benjamin Goldthwait. After the Raid on Dartmouth (1749), Clapham raised a company of 70 men to fight the Mi'kmaq. Clapham relieved Gorham in the Battle at St. Croix. He was involved in the Battle at Chignecto. The first raid on Halifax happened in October 1750, while in the woods on peninsular Halifax, Mi'kmaq scalped two British people and took six prisoner: Edward Cornwallis' gardener, his son, and Captain William Clapham's book keeper were tortured and scalped. The Mi'kmaq buried the son while the gardener's body was left behind and the other six persons were taken prisoner to Grand Pre for five months.-; Atkins puts the month of this raid in July and writes that there were six British attacked, two were scalped and four were taken prisoner and never seen again. Ezekiel (Eziekiel) Gilman abandoned the saw mill in the wake of the Raid on Dartmouth and Clapham took charge of it. In the Raid on Dartmouth (1751), Captain Clapham and his company of Rangers were stationed on Blockhouse hill. He and the company are reported to have remained within the block-house firing from the loop-holes during the whole raid. A court martial was called on 14 May, the day after the raid, to inquire into the conduct of the different commanding officers who allowed the village to be destroyed. By June, Clapham's Sergeant had been acquitted. In the same year, Clapham was tried for killing a prisoner after having gagged him too tightly.

The story concerns a former college professor, disgraced by a sex scandal, who now works in a minor post at a publishing company. The play explores his relationships with his parasitic group of friends and treats issues of homosexuality, guilt and friendship. The work was Wheeler's first play, and afterwards he turned to playwriting full-time.Hampton, Wilborn. Obituary: \\"Hugh Wheeler, Award Winning Playwright\\", The New York Times, July 28, 1987, retrieved March 14, 2014 After an out-of-town tryout in Philadelphia beginning on February 27, 1961,Cronyn, Hume. \\"Dear Diary\\", Theatre Arts Magazine, July 1961, reproduced in Senelick, pp. 74‚Äì82 the piece premiered on March 15 at ANTA Playhouse on Broadway in New York City.Wheeler, unnumbered introductory page The production was directed by John Gielgud. It ran for 101 performances, closing on July 10, 1961.\\"Big Fish, Little Fish\\", Internet Broadway Database, retrieved 14 March 2014 The production did not make money at the box office,Bordman, p. 375 but despite only mixed to warm reviews, it won two Tony awards, for Best Director and Best Featured Actor, and was nominated for two more. A London production the following year was a failure, closing within two weeks. The piece has rarely been revived, but it was adapted for television in 1971. Big Fish, Little Fish was one of the first Broadway plays to explore frankly the issue of homosexuality,Senelick, p. 74 and Gielgud ignored advice to tone down the \\"implicit queerness\\".Croall, p. 463 Hume Cronyn kept a diary of the original production. He reported that, during rehearsals, the cast and creative team engaged in long discussions about the homosexuality theme. He commented that attempts to \\"prejudge audience or critical reaction\\" could lead to a \\"safe but regretful\\" production. Cronyn praised Gielgud's process and his abilities as a \\"director-analyst\\". He also praised the talent, creativity and generosity of Wheeler and of the other actors in the cast.

The time is the present (1961). William has worked in a minor position in a publishing firm for more than two decades. Before that he was a rising academic, the youngest full professor at a prestigious university. He was forced out of the post after a scandal: a young student broke into his rooms and committed suicide, leaving a note claiming that William seduced and then abandoned him. William's denials were not believed.Wheeler, p. 48 His middle-aged circle of friends, who all have emotional demands on him, are: Edith, a married woman with whom he sometimes sleeps; Jimmie, a schoolmaster with cultural aspirations and a crush on William;Wheeler, pp. 3‚Äì5 Basil, a retired publisher and lonely cat-lover; Hilda, a minor executive who aspires to be racy; and Viola, a former lover of William's, who is not seen but rings him frequently, usually when drunk.Wheeler, p. 13 William is kind and sweet to his friends, but it is not clear how much he depends emotionally on being a big fish in a small pond.Wheeler, p. 5 William's friends bicker with one another and sometimes with him, but the group is generally stable until the arrival of Ronnie, an ambitious young author.Wheeler, p. 33 He has been asked to find someone to fill an unexpected senior vacancy in a publishing company in Geneva, and he successfully seeks to interest William in the post. Most of William's friends resist, then accept with sadness, the prospect of his departure for Europe, but Basil is devastated and suffers a fatal heart attack from the shock.Wheeler, p. 100 Shortly before his departure for Geneva, in conversation with Jimmie, William confesses that he was not the victim of an injustice at the university: the student's accusation was true. He has been working in a lowly position ever since as a form of penance and expiation.Wheeler, p. 105 The Swiss appointment falls through at the last minute.Wheeler, p. 109 William nevertheless announces his intention to go to Europe on holiday, hosting a farewell party where he expresses his unhappiness with his friends. It is left ambiguous as to whether he will return to resume his place at the center of his New York circle. The play ends with him once more soothing Viola over the phone.Wheeler, p. 115 Critical reception Reviewing the premiere for The New York Times, Howard Taubman wrote, \\"There is a softness at the core of the play because there is a disquieting elusiveness about the central character. If you can believe in him, and Jason Robards Jr. makes a brilliant effort to turn him into a credible human being, you may find the essential story deeply moving. But if you can't, the work goes soggy.‚Ä¶ Mr. Wheeler has not always steered a straight, clear course. But he writes of strange relationships with an integrity that is occasionally beguiling.\\"Taubman, Howard. \\"The Theatre: Odd Circle; Robards and Cronyn in Big Fish, Little Fish\\", The New York Times, 16 March 1961, p. 42 The New York correspondent of The Times praised the virtuosity of the cast and director, and said of the play, \\"Still, good parts require to be written, and Mr. Wheeler, hitherto known only as a writer of detective novels... has written them. And yet these characters are, in a sense, set adrift by their intense devotion to the less interesting character played by Mr. Robards and by their old isolation from the rest of the world.\\"\\"Not so dramatic on Broadway\\", The Times, 1 May 1961, p. 16 In Theatre Journal, John Gassner shared his view that the central role was not the strong point of the play, but he praised both Wheeler and Cronyn for their sensitive and honest treatment of Jimmie's hidden homosexuality.Gassner, John. \\"Broadway in Review\\", Theatre Journal, Vol. 13, No. 2 (May 1961), p. 106 Later productions The play opened at the Duke of York's Theatre in London's West End on 18 September 1962, directed by Frith Banbury, with Hume Cronyn as Jimmie, Thomas Coley as William, Frank Pettingell as Basil, Frederick Jaeger as Ronnie, Carl Jaff√© as Paul, Jessica Tandy as Edith and Viola Lyel as Hilda.

Biography Schumacher was born in Colmar in 1690. After studying philosophy at the University of Strasbourg, he became the tutor of the Count of Leiningen-Hartenburg. When he went with him to Paris, he met Pierre Lefort (1676-1754), a nephew of Peter the Great's admiral, who invited him to join him in Russia, where Peter the Great took him into service as a librarian. Some years later, in 1714, he became secretary of the department of medicine, and librarian of the Library of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which had opened in 1703. Peter the Great sent him to France, England, and the Netherlands in 1721, to invite scholars to settle in St. Petersbourg. Laurentius Blumentrost (1692-1755), founder of the academy, made him secretary of the academy in 1724, putting him in charge of the new Academic Library and the Kunstkamera. Meanwhile, a certain number of scholars, among them Bilfinger and Bernoulli, arrived at St Petersburg. Over the years, some scholars, like Bernoulli, leave the academy, accusing Schumacher of despotism. Suffering from Schumacher‚Äôs persecutions, M√ºller was forced to go to Siberia in 1732, where he stayed until 1743. A formal complaint was carried before the academy's senate, charging him with authoritarianism and misappropriation of funds. However, he was only found guilty of the misappropriation of the alcohol stores of the academy. Following this, he set up a printing house linked to the Academy, dealing with the liberal arts and mechanics. The second president of the academy, Baron Johann Albrecht von Korff, ignoring the observation of the academic Louis de l'Isle on \\"... the disadvantage caused to the Academy by the dependence of the Academy from the chancellery ...\\", made Schumacher his counselor, putting him in charge of the academy‚Äôs accounts.He later changed his views on Schumacher and called him a despot in 1755 Following a complaint by the academic Andrey Nartov regarding the Academy‚Äôs expenses (to the tune of 109 rubles), Schumacher was suspended from office and placed under house arrest on 7 October 1742. In the end, a commission under Prince Boris Youssoupov cleared him of all charges, and he was reinstituted into all his positions in 1746. Under his guidance, the first catalogue of the books of the Academy was published (1742-1747), as well as a catalogue of the exhibits titled Musei imperialis petropolitani (1741-1745). His correspondences with Kirillov, Blumentrost and others was published in 1866 by Piotr Pekarski (1828-1872). In 1750 he was made a state counselor. Having grown senile, he was pensioned off in 1757 and died in 1761 at Saint Petersburg. He was married to Anna Dorothea von Velten, daughter of Johann Velten, head cook of Peter the Great. Empress Elisabeth gave him the estate of Unipiha on 4 October 1759. His widow remained in possession of the estate until 1768. His daughter, Eleonora Dorothea, was married twice, first 1750 to Johann Casper Taubert and after hist death, to Petr Stupishin(1718‚Äì1782). His other daughter, Anna Dorothea von Schumacher (1730-1801), was married twice, first to Johann VII Burchard von B√©llawary, then to Johann Amman.

The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), a loyalist paramilitary group, detonated a car bomb outside a pub crowded with people celebrating Saint Patrick's Day. Four Catholic civilians were killed by the blast‚Äîincluding two 13-year-old boys standing outside‚Äîand almost 50 people were injured, some severely. In December 1980, UVF member Garnet James Busby confessed to having been one of the bombers and was sentenced to life in prison. The UVF unit responsible was the Mid-Ulster Brigade, which at the time was led by Robin Jackson. The attack is one of many linked to the Glenanne gang, a loose association of loyalist militants and rogue members of the Northern Ireland security forces, who carried out a series of attacks against the Catholic/Irish nationalist community in the area during the 1970s. Situation in Northern Ireland By the mid-1970s, the conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles, showed no signs of abating. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) intensified its bombing campaign to drive British forces out, and began targeting English cities. The main loyalist paramilitary groups‚Äîthe UVF and Ulster Defence Association (UDA)‚Äîresponded with random attacks on the local Catholic population, which in turn led to IRA reprisals against Protestants. During 1975 the IRA was officially on ceasefire. Loyalists believed the ceasefire was part of a secret deal between the British Government and IRA which would mean a British withdrawal from Northern Ireland.Taylor, Peter (1999). Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury .p.142 According to journalist Peter Taylor, the vicious tit-for-tat violence between the IRA and loyalists made 1975 one of the \\"bloodiest years of the conflict\\".Taylor, pp.142-43 In Belfast, the loyalist Shankill Butchers gang, led by Lenny Murphy, began an 18-month killing spree designed to strike terror into the Catholic community, whom they believed were giving succour to the IRA. The gang would drive around Catholic areas in a black taxi and kidnap random Catholic passersby, then torture and hack them to death.Taylor, pp.152-53 However, most tit-for-tat attacks were bombings and shootings targeting pubs, or roadside ambushes, as in the case of the Miami Showband massacre. This saw three members of the popular Irish cabaret band shot dead at a fake military checkpoint by UVF gunmen in British Army uniforms. Two of those convicted were Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldiers.Taylor, pp.147-49 Investigations established that UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade commander Robin Jackson was the organizer and main gunman in the July 1975 ambush.

A further 50 paramilitary attacks have been linked to Jackson, including the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which killed 33 people.\\"Report of the Independent International Panel on Alleged Collusion in Sectarian Killings in Northern Ireland\\", October 2006 (The Cassel Report 2006), p.68 Retrieved 15 March 2014Miami Showband massacre: HET raises collusion concerns BBC News 14 December 2011 Retrieved 14 March 2014 In January 1976, the UVF killed six members of two Catholic families in a co-ordinated attack. The following evening, IRA members (using the covername \\"Republican Action Force\\") retaliated by shooting eleven Protestant men after ordering them out of a minibus. Only one survived.Taylor, p.149 Loyalists sought revenge, and members of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade planned to attack a nearby Catholic primary school. The operation was aborted by the UVF leadership on the grounds that it was \\"morally unacceptable\\", would provoke a terrible response from the IRA and could spark civil war.\\"UVF planned to kill 30 children\\". Irish News. McCaffrey, Barry; McKinney, Seamus. 9 July 2007 Retrieved 15 March 2014 Harold Wilson announced on 16 March 1976 that he was resigning as British Prime Minister. That same day, the British Army defused a 200-pound IRA bomb left outside a garage in Dungannon. The bombing The Hillcrest Bar (now McAleer's)\\"Priest‚Äôs words of comfort to father of 13 year-old killed in St Patrick‚Äôs Day bomb\\". Tyrone Times. 14 March 2016. on Dungannon's Donaghmore Road, was a pub frequented by Catholics and was jointly owned by a Catholic and a Protestant. An incendiary device had been planted inside the premises the year before.\\"Report of the Independent International Panel on Alleged Collusion in Sectarian Killings in Northern Ireland\\", October 2006 (The Cassel Report 2006), p.53 Retrieved 15 March 2014 On the evening of 17 March 1976, the pub was packed with revelers celebrating Saint Patrick's Day. There was also a disco for young people being held in a school across the road.\\"Murdered by the Glenanne gang: ‚ÄòPatrick lived till the ripe old age of 13‚Äô\\". The Irish Times. 2 May 2015. According to writer and former British soldier Ken Wharton, a loyalist attack had been anticipated in Northern Ireland as 'Catholic pubs' would be packed with people enjoying the Irish holiday. Earlier that day in East Belfast, Catholic teacher John Donnelly had been drinking in the Cregagh Inn on Woodstock Road. When one of his former students identified him as a Catholic, UDA members who happened to be in the pub forced him outside (in full view of the customers) and stabbed him to death behind the building.Wharton, Ken (2013). Wasted Years, Wasted Lives, Volume 1: The British Army in Northern Ireland, 1975-1977. UK: Helion & Company That evening, UVF members parked a green Austin-Healey 1100 car outside the Hillcrest Bar. It had been stolen in Armagh nine days earlier. At 8.20 pm, the time bomb hidden in the car exploded. The blast killed three people outright and fatally wounded another.Llywelyn, Morgan \\"1999; A year of the Celtic Tiger and the Search For Peace. pp. 190-91 Almost 50 people were injured, nine of them severely. The force of the blast blew out all the pub's windows and rained debris on the footpath outside. The pub manager, who had been upstairs when the bomb detonated, said \\"everything just simply erupted around us. There was no warning\\".McKittrick, David (1999). Lost Lives. Mainstream Publishing Company, Ltd. p. 634 One of those killed was Joseph Kelly (57), who had been inside the pub. Two 13-year-old boys, James McCaughey and Patrick Barnard, were in the street near the car bomb when it went off; James was mutilated beyond recognition and Patrick would die of his horrific injuries in hospital the following day. The boys were on their way to a disco at a school across the road. Andrew Small (62) was walking past with his wife and was also killed in the blast. All of the victims were Catholic civilians with no links to republican paramilitary groups. The getaway car used by the bombers had been stolen in Portadown. It was found burnt out a mile from the bomb site. =Responsibility= The 17 March bombing is one of the attacks that the Pat Finucane Centre (PFC) has attributed to the Glenanne gang. This was a loose alliance of loyalist militants (in particular the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade) and rogue members of the Northern Ireland security forces: the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the British Army's Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). The group carried out a series of attacks against Catholics/Irish nationalists in the area during the 1970s. The PFC requested that Professor Douglass Cassel (formerly of Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago) convene an international inquiry to investigate allegations of collusion between loyalists and the security forces in sectarian killings. This international team concluded in their 2006 report that the Hillcrest Bar bombing was one of the attacks perpetrated by the Glenanne gang. In December 1980, Dungannon UVF member Garnet James Busby confessed to having been part of the bombing unit. He also confessed to other attacks, including another Dungannon pub bombing, and the double murder of married couple Peter and Jane McKearney at Listamlet, Moy, County Tyrone in 1975. (The couple was mistakenly believed by loyalists to be related or even the parents of PIRA volunteer Margaret McKearney, but were, in fact, unrelated.)J. Bowyer Bell. The Irish Troubles: A Generation of Violence 1967-1992 (St. Martin's Press: New York); / Although Busby named three other men involved in the Hillcrest Bar bombing he was the only one convicted. At his trial, an RUC inspector told the court that the same UVF group had carried out the Miami Showband killings. In 1981 Garnet Busby received six life sentences for the murders of the McKearneys, Joseph Kelly, Andrew Small, James McCaughey and Patrick Barnard. He was sent to the Maze Prison.\\"Report of the Independent International Panel on Alleged Collusion in Sectarian Killings in Northern Ireland, October 2006\\" (The Cassel Report 2006), p. 111; retrieved 15 March 2014Collusion in the South Armagh/Mid-Ulster area in the mid-1970s , patfinucanecentre.org; retrieved 14 March 2014.

Early life =Childhood (1977-1992)= Sunita Danuwar was born to parents Ganga Ban and Chandrakala Ban in Kasigadh VDC, Dailekh district, which is located in the remote western part of Nepal. Because girls' education is not a priority for most poor Nepalese families, Danuwar didn't have the opportunity to go to school during her childhood. Nevertheless, her father taught her the Nepali alphabet and numbers. At the age of five, after having lost six brothers and sisters from malnutrition, poverty and lack of access to health care, she and her family settled in Jammu and Kashmir, a state in northern India. When Danuwar reached the age of fourteen, the family decided to move again, this time to Nainital. =Six months in a brothel (1996)= On the way to Nainital, her family stopped in Almora, a town in the state of Uttarakhand, in order to make some money to continue their travels. There, they met two Nepali tractor drivers and befriended them. When Danuwar's family finally gathered enough funds to continue the journey toward Nainital, the two tractor drivers drugged Danuwar's food, causing her to lose consciousness. They sold her to a brothel in Mumbai for 40,000 Indian rupees. When she realized she was in a brothel, Danuwar categorically refused to have sexual intercourse despite mental and physical torture she was enduring and she thought about committing suicide. Approximatively one month later, she was sold by the brothel owner to another brothel for 100,000 Indian rupees. There too she was tortured and threatened with death until the brothel owner ordered five men to rape her, leaving her with no other option but to work as a forced sex-worker during six months. She finally escaped on February 5, 1996, thanks to the major raids of brothels in Mumbai during that year, launched upon the huge pressure coming from national- and international-level child rights organizations to save minor children from forced sex slavery. During those raids, 484 girls and women were rescued from brothels. Over 40% of them were from Nepal, like Danuwar. Seven months later, nearly 128 Nepali girls and women returned in Kathmandu, Nepal and fifteen of them, including Danuwar, decided to create an organization called Shakti Samuha, Nepali for Power Group. Life after brothel (1996-present) =Shakti Samuha= Danuwar and her friends created Shakti Samuha in 1996. The main objective was to raise awareness about the issue of illegal trafficking of girls and women. She began to spend a lot of time walking the streets of several Nepali villages to warn young girls and women at risk of being trafficked. She also wrote scripts for plays in which she would act either as a brothel owner or as a broker, staging her plays with other members of Shakti Samuha directly in the streets. However, Danuwar isn't limited to a particular role in the organization. She's both a counsellor and a teacher for the rescued girls and women. She's also involved in the organization's policy- making, strategy development and training programs. Since 2011, she's serving her second term as the president of the organization (her first term lasted from 2000 to 2004). =Education= In 2001, Danuwar entered seventh grade in Kathmandu, Nepal and stayed two years at school thanks to the donor support of Shakti Samuha. In 2009, she managed to find funding to attend courses of school support for four months and then joined SLC, the final year of schooling in Nepal. She passed the secondary school examination and studied for two years in Padma Kanya Multiple Campus, Kathmandu. She's currently working toward a Bachelor of Arts in Social Works at Kadambery Academy, Kathmandu. =Other commitments= Danuwar has been a Board member of the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women since 2008 and one of the Executive Board members of NGO Federation of Nepal (NFN). She was also a chairperson of the Alliance Against Trafficking in Women and Children in Nepal (AATWIN) from 2009 to 2010. On April 14, 2015, she was part of the Panel of Speakers of a high-level event on the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons. After the April 2015 Nepal earthquake, Danuwar called for the greatest possible vigilance and enjoined girls and women in particular to protect themselves against sex trafficking. She declared \\"We are getting reports of [individuals] pretending to go for rescuing and looking at people.\\" Shakti Samuha was also one of Childreach International's partner in its Taught, Not Trafficked project. Concerning that project, she stated: \\"As a survivor of trafficking, I know how evil and damaging the practice is, and what consequences it has not just for those trafficked but whole communities. Childreach International's Taught, Not Trafficked project is a hugely important campaign that will help us reduce child trafficking in Nepal and hopefully, with the right education and storytelling, prevent it from happening in the future.\\" Danuwar is also one of the two main characters of The Color of Brave, a Nepali documentary directed by the filmmaker Binod Adhikari. Awards and honors * In 2012, Danuwar received a letter of honor from the US Special Operations Command in which they were recognizing her combat against human trafficking. * In 2014, she was selected as one of the finalists of Roland Berger Human Dignity Award. * In 2014, she was one of the ten persons who received the Child 10 (C10) Award for their fight against the trafficking of children. * In 2018, she received recognition from the U.S. Department of State in Washington.

Based on the short story \\"The Double-Dyed Deceiver\\" by O. Henry, the film is about a daring bandit called the Llano Kid who shoots a young gambler in self-defense and is forced to hide from the law. He is helped by a corrupt lawyer who involves the bandit in a scheme to swindle a Mexican aristocrat whose son turns out to be the young gambler killed by the Llano Kid. The screenplay was written by Daniel Nathan Rubin, and the story was adapted for the screen by Oliver H.P. Garrett and Victor Milner. Produced by Hector Turnbull for Paramount Pictures, The Texan was released in the United States on May 10, 1930. The film received positive reviews upon its theatrical release. Plot A young bandit called the Llano Kid (Gary Cooper) is wanted by the law and has a price on his head. After stopping in at the local blacksmith, John Brown (James A. Marcus), a highly religious man who fancies himself a sheriff, the Kid gets into a poker game during which he notices a young gambler cheating, confronts him, and is forced to kill him in self-defense. The Kid is then pursued by Sheriff Brown and is almost apprehended, but is able to get the draw on the zealous lawman. As the Kid leaps into the saddle, Sheriff Brown pledges, \\"God will deliver you into my hands.\\" Later aboard a train, the Kid meets an unscrupulous lawyer named Thacker (Oscar Apfel), who convinces him to pose as the son of Se√±ora Ibarra (Emma Dunn), a wealthy South American widow whose son Enrique disappeared fifteen years earlier. Having set himself up as the widow's agent hired to find the lost son, Thacker plans to return with her \\"son\\" and swindle the widow's gold in the process. Soon the two men set sail aboard a schooner to South America, where they arrive at Se√±ora Ibarra's family hacienda in a little seaport town of Buenas Tierras. With his basic Spanish speaking skills, new sideburns, and tattooed hand (similar to Enriques), the Kid is able to pass himself off as Enrique, the long lost son of Se√±ora Ibarra. Their plans are interrupted, however, when the Kid meets and falls in love with his lovely \\"niece\\" Consuelo (Fay Wray). Softened by Se√±ora Ibarra's affection for him, and his newfound love, he begins to have second doubts about the scheme. When the Kid learns that Se√±ora Ibarra's son was in fact the very man he shot in self-defense in the saloon, he calls off his deal with Thacker. Angered by this turn of events, Thacker organizes a gang to steal the gold outright. Meanwhile, Sheriff Brown arrives at Buenas Tierras, having finally tracked down the Llano Kid, who has been \\"delivered into his hands\\". He waits until nightfall before making the arrest. During the ensuing gunfight, the Kid is wounded, and Thacker is killed. Afterwards, Brown has a change of heart after seeing the Kid's true character and courage. The sheriff agrees to keep the Kid's identity secret so Enrique can continue his life with his new family.

Henry, which was first published in Everybody's Magazine in December 1905. The story was previously filmed as A Double-Dyed Deceiver (1920) with Jack Pickford in the lead role. Critical response In his review for The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall called the film \\"an expertly touched-up audible pictorial adaptation of O. Henry's story\\". Hall praises Cooper for his \\"capital acting\\", comparing his performance to his earlier success, The Virginian. \\"The lean, lanky Mr. Cooper elicits a great deal of sympathy as the double-dyed deceiver,\\" Hall observes. He also acknowledges the supporting performances by screen veterans Oscar Apfel, the \\"splendid\\" James Marcus, the \\"pleasing\\" Emma Dunn, and Fay Wray, who \\"has never been more captivating than she is as Consuelo\\". Hall gives most of the credit for the film's success to director John Cromwell and screenwriter Oliver H. P. Garrett, who are able to balance the irony of O'Henry's original story with a love interest that is \\"adroitly introduced without hindering the d√©nouement\\".

Encyclop√©die compl√®te. 1885 √† nos jours.Linz, Schrader: Die Internationale Automobil-Enzyklop√§die. Louis Chenard was always a relatively low volume manufacturer. Engines were bought in, mostly from Chapuis-Dornier. There is no connection between Louis Chenard and the larger, better remembered Chenard & Walcker company. The cars Louis Chenard's first car was a 7/9CV presented in 1920, featuring a 4-cylinder 1¬º-litre engine and 3 forward speeds. 4-speed transmissions and a choice of engines soon followed. At the time of the 19th Paris Motor Show, in October 1924, the Louis Chenard range was focused on two models. The \\"Louis Chenard Type D\\" competed in the 7HP class. It was powered by a 1095cc overhead valve engine and sat on a wheelbase. The other model closely resembled the \\"Type D\\", but its 1495cc engine placed it in the 10HP class, and its wheelbase made it slightly longer. Fitted with \\"Torpedo\\" bodies the two models were in 1924 priced by the manufacturer at respectively 18,000 francs and 22,900 francs. The same range was on offer two years later at the 20th Paris Motor Show in October 1926.There was no \\"Salon de l'Automobile\\" in 1925 due to the venue having been allocated to an Exhibition of Decorative Arts. Prices had increased, however, and \\"Torpedo\\" bodied versions were in 1926 priced by the manufacturer at 26,950 francs (7HP) and 32,750 francs (10HP). Competition A Louis Chenard competed in the 24 Hour Race in 1924, driven by Louis Chenard himself (with a family member as a co-driver). The car retired after 13 laps. However, that year there were many early retirements, and Louis Chenard had kept going for long enough to be placed 32nd out of the 39 cars that started.

The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. The Ingomar Elementary School offers a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, Homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. Ingomar Elementary School provides health services to students as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. A nurse is available in the building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health‚Äôs extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. School safety and bullying The North Allegheny School District administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying at Ingomar Elementary School in 2012. Each year the school safety data is reported by the District to the Safe School Center which publishes the reports online. The North Allegheny School Board has provided the district's anti-bully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the District must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3.

The motif is of a severed (cabossed or erased) wild boar's head with an arrow in its mouth or through its head. The Triballi were an ancient tribe whose name was used as an exonym for the Serbs by archaizing Byzantine authors in the Middle Ages. The Triballian coat of arms depicts the head of a boar pierced by an arrow. In the Chronicle of the Council of Constance from 1415, the motif is used as the coat of arms of the Serbian Despotate and is recalled in one of Stefan Lazareviƒá's personal seals. It was used for historical Serbia in numerous armorials dating between the 15th and 18th centuries. The Habsburg Monarchy adopted it into their flag of Serbia (as claimants), one of the flags given to an honorary flag-bearer during the coronation of the Hungarian king, since 1563. It was adopted by Karaƒëorƒëe into the seal of the Revolutionary Serbian government, alongside the Serbian cross.

(Budapest, District XIII, √öjpesti Quay Nr 5). Carlos de Almeida Fonseca Sampaio Garrido (5 April 1883 ‚Äì April 1960) was a Portuguese diplomat credited with saving the lives of approximately 1,000 Jews in Nazi-occupied Hungary while serving as Portugal‚Äôs ambassador in Budapest between July and December 1944. Life and work He served as Minister Plenipotentiary and acting Ambassador of Portugal in Budapest from 1939-44. Along with Teixeira Branquinho, (Portuguese Charg√© d'Affaires in Budapest in 1944) Garrido rented houses and apartments to shelter and protect refugees from deportation and murder. They obtained permission from the Portuguese government to issue safe conduct passes to all persons who had relatives in Portugal, Brazil, or the Portuguese colonies or had a connection to Portugal. Garrido and Branquinho also established an office of the Portuguese Red Cross at the Portuguese legation to care for Jewish refugees. This was largely done in cooperation with the Portuguese Foreign Office and under Prime Minister Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar‚Äôs direct supervision with the provision that these refugees would not try to get Portuguese citizenship.Pimentel, pp. 343-50 On 23 April 1944 and following the German occupation of Hungary, the Portuguese ruler Salazar decided to order his ambassador to return to Lisbon and leave the charg√© d'affaires, Teixeira Branquinho in his place. This recall was done in response to a request from Britain and the United States who wanted neutral countries to downgrade their diplomatic presence in Hungary.Milgram p. 264 Five days later, on 28 April 1944, at 5 a.m., the Hungarian political police raided the Ambassador's home arresting his guests. The Ambassador physically resisted the police and was also arrested but managed to have his guests released by invoking the extraterritorial legal rights of diplomatic legations. Five of the guests were members from the famous Gabor family.Milgram 2011, p. 263 Magda Gabor, Hungarian-born actress and socialite, and the elder sister of Zsa Zsa and Eva Gabor, was reported to have been the secretary, fianc√©e and lover of Sampaio Garrido.Relationship with Dr. Carlos Almeida Afonseca de Sampayo Garrido cited in \\"The Most Wives Club\\" article in Palm Springs Life (1996)Relationship with Dr. Carlo de Sampayo also mentioned in an interview with Magda's sister, Zsa Zsa, as cited in Vanity Fair; accessed 25 October 2015.Zsa Zsa G√°bor: my story, written for me by Gerold Frank (World Publishing Co., 1960), pg. 161.

(1975) pgs. 135-49, 173 Gabor's maternal grandmother and uncle Sebastian (Annette Lantos's father) chose to remain in Budapest feeling they \\"had a good place to hide\\". However, both were killed during an Allied bombing raid. In 1945 he was appointed extraordinary envoy and minister plenipotentiary to Stockholm, Sweden. In 2006 the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation honored both Sampayo Garrido and his charg√© d'affaires Carlos de Liz-Texeira Branquinho.

Raised in early 1916, the battalion subsequently fought in the trenches of the Western Front from late 1916 until the end of the war in November 1918. After the war, the 43rd was re-raised as a part-time unit in South Australia, serving until 1930 when it was merged with the 48th Battalion. During the Second World War, the 43rd was briefly re-raised between 1942 and 1944, but did not see action before it was disbanded. After the war, the 43rd and 48th were once again merged, existing until 1960 when they became part of the Royal South Australia Regiment. History =First World War= The 43rd Battalion was raised on 7 March 1916, in Australia during the expansion of Australian Imperial Force (AIF), which took place at the end of the Gallipoli Campaign. Assigned to the 11th Brigade, it formed part of the 3rd Division, and was raised from volunteers drawn mainly from the state of South Australia. With an authorised strength of 1,023 men, after a period of rudimentary training in Australia, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Gordon, the 43rd Battalion departed Australia in June 1916 aboard the transport Afric, bound for the United Kingdom. Sailing via Egypt, they undertook further training on Salisbury Plain, before the 3rd Division was sent to France in late 1916, where they joined the other four infantry divisions of the AIF. Lawrence Weathers, the 43rd Battalion's sole Victoria Cross recipient. For the next two years, the battalion fought in the trenches along the Western Front in France and Belgium, taking part in several major battles. Its first significant action came during the Battle of Messines in June 1917, as part of the successful, but costly, effort to capture the Wytschaete-Messines Ridge near the salient that had developed in the frontline around Ypres. Later, in October 1917, the 43rd took part the Third Battle of Ypres, attacking around Broodseinde at the start of the month and then around Passchendaele a week later. During the fighting around Broodseinde, the 43rd formed part of the 3rd Division's spearhead and was successful in helping them advance over , while during the attack on Passchendaele the battalion formed part of the divisional reserve along with the rest of the 11th Brigade and was committed to the front line late after the assaulting forces were forced to retire after their initial gains were negated by German attacks on the division's flank. In early 1918, after the collapse of Tsarist Russia enabled a significant shift of German combat power from the Eastern Front to the Western Front, the Germans launched their Spring Offensive. The opening blows fell against the British in the Somme and as the offensive gained momentum, the Allies were pushed back significantly. With the vital rail head of Amiens threatened, the Australian units which had wintered in Belgium were brought south to the Somme to help stem the tide of the German advance. The 43rd Battalion subsequently undertook several defensive actions including one around Morlancourt. After the German offensive was halted, as the Allies sought to regain the initiative, they took part in the Battle of Hamel in July, where the battalion attacked in the centre of the 11th Brigade, tasked with securing the village itself. In August, the 43rd joined the Allied Hundred Days Offensive after which it took part in several attacks against the Hindenburg Line in the final months of the war. One of the battalion's last actions came at the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin in September 1918. For his actions during this battle Corporal Lawrence Weathers was awarded the Victoria Cross, the only member of the 43rd Battalion to be bestowed this honour, receiving it for attacking two German trenches with grenades during an assault on the Bouchavesnes Ridge on 2 September 1918. In early October 1918, the Australian Corps, which had suffered heavily during the fighting earlier in the year, was withdrawn from the line for rest and reorganisation and did not return to the front before the armistice was signed in November. After the war, the 43rd Battalion was disbanded in 1919 and its surviving personnel repatriated back to Australia. During the course of the war, the battalion suffered the following casualties: 386 killed and 1,321 wounded. Between June 1916 and March 1918, eight batches of reinforcements were dispatched to the 43rd Battalion from Australia. The 43rd Battalion's contribution to the Australian effort on the Western Front was recognised by the awarding of 15 battle honours in 1927. =Inter-war years and subsequent service= Australia's part-time military force, the Citizen Force, was reorganised in 1921 to perpetuate the numerical designations and divisional structure of the AIF. As a result, the 43rd Battalion was re-raised within the 4th Military District in South Australia where it formed part of the 3rd Brigade, headquartered at Keswick Barracks. Upon formation, the battalion drew its personnel mainly from the 2nd Battalion, 43rd Infantry Regiment as well as elements of several other units including the 10th, 48th and 50th Infantry Regiments, which had been formed in 1912 following the establishment of the Universal Training Scheme. Soldiers from the 43rd Battalion at Berry Springs, Northern Territory, in November 1942 When territorial designations were introduced in 1927, the battalion adopted the title of the \\"Hindmarsh Regiment\\". It also adopted the motto of Nil Desperandum at this time and formed an alliance with the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. In 1930, after the newly elected James Scullin Labor government suspended compulsory training, the battalion was amalgamated with the 48th Battalion. The two units remained linked until 27 August 1942, when they were re-raised in their own right as part of the expansion of the Australian military during the Second World War. It was subsequently deployed to the Northern Territory as part of the 3rd and 23rd Brigades. Nevertheless, the 43rd Battalion did not see action during the war and was disbanded on 6 April 1944. After the war, when Australia's military was reorganised the 43rd Battalion was reformed once again as an amalgamated unit known as the 43rd/48th Battalion, which remained in existence until 1960 when it was subsumed into the Royal South Australia Regiment (RSAR), following a reorganisation that saw the creation of six multi-battalion state-based regiments within the Citizen Military Forces. In 1961, the battalion was entrusted with the 14 battle honours awarded to the 2/43rd Battalion for their involvement in the fighting in North Africa and the South-West Pacific during the Second World War. Although it currently no longer exists, for a period after 1966, following the reintroduction of national service, the 43rd Battalion was re-raised within the RSAR, as a remote area battalion within the Citizens Military Force, offering special conditions of service for soldiers who had elected to serve in the CMF rather than the Regular Army, but who could not meet their training requirements through normal attendance due to their occupation or place of residence.

It stars Kalki Koechlin as an Indian teenager with cerebral palsy who relocates to America for her undergraduate education and comes of age following her complex relationship with a blind girl, played by Sayani Gupta. Revathi, Kuljeet Singh, and William Moseley play supporting roles. Produced by Bose in partnership with Viacom18 Motion Pictures, Margarita with a Straw was co-written by Bose and Nilesh Maniyar. The film deals with the challenging concepts of sexuality, inclusion, self-love, and self-acceptance. Bose conceived the idea for the film in January 2011, during a conversation with Malini Chib‚Äîher cousin and a disability rights activist‚Äîabout the latter's desire to have a normal sex life. Inspired by Chib's story, Bose wrote the first draft of the film's script. After winning a Sundance Mahindra Global Filmmaker Award for the draft, she modified the script to reflect her own perspective, incorporating several personal experiences into the narrative. Bose completed the screenplay with co-writer Maniyar and the advisory council of the Sundance Institute. Bose was keen to cast an actress with cerebral palsy for the central part, but eventually hired Koechlin, who learnt the movements and speech patterns of people with the disorder. Filming took place in Delhi and New York in 2013, with Anne Misawa as the director of photography. The film was selected for the National Film Development Corporation of India's Work-in-Progress Lab initiative during post-production, which was completed in the latter half of 2013. The soundtrack for the film was composed by Mikey McCleary. Margarita with a Straw premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. It was also screened at the Tallinn Black Nights, the BFI London, the Vesoul Festival of Asian Cinema, and the Galway Film Fleadh. The film was released theatrically in India on 17 April 2015 to positive reviews. Commentators praised most aspects of the production, Koechlin's performance, and Bose's direction. Koechlin won the Screen Award for Best Actress and the National Film Award ‚Äì Special Jury Award, and Bose won the NETPAC Award at Toronto. Commercially, Margarita with a Straw grossed over 74 million against a production budget of 65 million.  Plot  Laila Kapoor (Kalki Koechlin) is a teenager with cerebral palsy, studying at Delhi University. She is an aspiring writer and also composes music for an indie band at the university. Laila develops feelings for the lead singer, but is heartbroken when she is rejected. Moving on from the experience, Laila is overjoyed to receive a scholarship for a semester's study at New York University. Despite her father's reservations, she moves to Greenwich Village, Manhattan with her orthodox Maharashtrian mother Shubhangini Damle (Revathi). Laila meets an attractive young man named Jared (William Moseley), who is assigned to help her in the creative writing class. She also meets a young activist, Khanum (Sayani Gupta), a blind girl of Pakistani-Bangladeshi descent, with whom she falls in love. Laila is enamoured by Khanum's fiercely independent personality and her positive perspective towards her own disability. The two spend most of their time together, filling in as each other's caregivers. Laila becomes confused about her sexual orientation, as she is attracted to men‚ÄîJared in particular‚Äîwhile being in a serious relationship with Khanum. She has sex with Jared, only to regret it immediately. Laila does not tell Khanum about this encounter. Oblivious to her daughter's relationship with Khanum, Laila's mother invites Khanum to Delhi to spend the winter vacation with Laila's family. Laila ultimately finds the courage to come out to her mother about her sexuality and her relationship with Khanum, both of which her mother strongly disapproves. Laila also confesses to Khanum that she had sex with Jared and asks for her forgiveness. Feeling betrayed by Laila, Khanum breaks up with her and leaves for New York. Shubhangini is diagnosed with advanced colon cancer which has relapsed after previous treatments. Laila and she move past their differences while Laila tends to her at the hospital. The two eventually reconcile shortly before Shubhangini's death. Laila plays a song (recorded by Shubhangi) at Shubhangini's funeral telling how much she loved her and how she was the only one who ever understood her. Laila is later seen drinking a margarita.

She worked on the first draft extensively for about a month. Although the main character of Laila is based on her cousin Malini Chib, a disability rights activist, the narrative follows Bose's own experience of losing a family member. She acknowledged the difficulty of incorporating her personal story into the story, calling it a \\"tough emotional journey\\". The idea of working on a film about disability was conceived during a casual conversation between Bose and her aunt (Chib's mother), who wanted her niece to work on a similar project aimed at creating awareness regarding the subject. Having grown up in the same household as Chib, Bose was familiar with the discrimination faced by people with disabilities. She was especially intrigued by the general ignorance exhibited towards the sexuality of people with disabilities, and therefore decided to incorporate it into the narrative. Bose later adapted the original draft into a feature film-length script for Margarita with a Straw with co-writer Nilesh Maniyar. In 2012, the script won the Sundance Mahindra Global Filmmaker Award. As part of the prize, the duo were awarded mentorships from the Sundance Institute's staff and creative advisors, and participated in a Feature Film Program Lab, which is where Bose decided to modify the story. After being told by the advisory board that she was \\"not in the skin of the character\\", Bose decided to rewrite the script from her own perspective, instead of solely trying to incorporate Chib's point of view. She said that only after winning the award she incorporated‚Äîalbeit unconsciously‚Äîher experiences as a bisexual woman in India into the narrative. Bose and Maniyar worked for two years on the script as it went through over forty revisions before becoming the final screenplay. = Casting = alt=William Moseley looking away from the camera. Bose originally intended to cast actors with the same disabilities as the characters of Laila and Khanum. Since there were no actresses with cerebral palsy in India, she held auditions for the role in institutions that catered to patients, but could not find a suitable person to play the central role. Bose also had a meeting with a blind actress in her early thirties to discuss the role of Khanum, a character she associated herself with. The actress refused to pursue the role, being uncomfortable with the sexual content of the script. She nevertheless helped Bose by assisting Sayani Gupta, who was eventually cast as Khanum. Having decided to cast a professional for the part of Laila, Bose approached Kalki Koechlin, who she said was her \\"first and only choice\\" for the role. Since Koechlin was still shooting for Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013) at the time, Bose began looking for other actresses to play the role, but felt that \\"something was missing\\" in each one. She eventually decided to push the filming back for three months to accommodate her first choice. Koechlin admitted that the role was the most challenging of her film career and she took six months to prepare for it. She underwent a six-week training workshop with actor Adil Hussain, which was aimed at making her \\"body language seem natural\\", while also focusing on the speech pattern of patients with cerebral palsy. Koechlin spent considerable time with Chib and her physiotherapist and speech therapist. She also attended a month-long workshop in Delhi, where she worked on body part movements. Although the film addresses aspects of the challenges of physical disability, Koechlin dubbed it \\"a romcom within some hurdles\\". Bose too described the film as a coming-of-age story about a \\"woman's journey of finding love\\". Maniyar, who also served as the casting director for the film, contacted Gupta for the role of Khanum while she was working on the travel show Yeh Hai India Meri Jaan. Immediately drawn to the character, Gupta agreed to audition and was cast for the role after a lengthy selection process that lasted about a month. She said in a later interview that she had felt fortunate to have bagged the character of Khanum. To prepare for the role, Gupta stayed blindfolded while doing daily activities such as cooking and bathing and spent time with a special voice and accent trainer. She also attended classes at the National Association for the Blind, where she learned basic braille. Revathi, who had previously played a mother to a young child with cerebral palsy in Anjali (1990), agreed to play Laila's mother after reading the script. William Moseley was cast as Jared, a British student in Laila's class. = Filming and post-production = alt=An empty street on a sunny day. Principal photography for Margarita with a Straw began in 2013 and took place at New Delhi and New York with two separate schedules. Anne Misawa worked as the director of photography. While the first half of the story is set in the Shri Ram College of Commerce of Delhi University, it was mainly filmed at Miranda House. Students and staff members from institutions such as Ramjas College and Lady Shri Ram were involved actively in the project. Tenzin Dalha‚Äîa final year political science student from the former‚Äîplayed one of Koechlin's love interests in the film, and Shuchi Dwivedi from the latter played Koechlin's best friend. Other students from the university were cast as members of a local band, which also included Dalha and Dwivedi. Koechlin's father was played by Kuljeet Singh, an English Literature professor from Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College. Set in the neighbourhood of Greenwich Village, the second half of Margarita with a Straw was shot during the summer in New York. Filming took place at Roosevelt Island and Coney Island. Snow machines created the artificial environment required for various sequences set during winter season. The crew faced difficulties in filming certain scenes. At one point, the van that was used to carry Koechlin in her wheelchair broke down and had to be manually stabilised during the shoot. Prior to the filming of the sex scenes, the cast attended workshops to develop a better understanding of emotional and sexual intimacy. Moseley, who was especially anxious about his scenes with Koechlin, attended a workshop conducted by Bose herself. The complete film was shot in two months. Margarita with a Straw was selected for the National Film Development Corporation of India's Work in Progress Lab initiative during post-production in 2013. It was edited by Monisha Baldawa and the sound mixing was done by Resul Pookutty and Amrit Pritam. Certain scenes with frontal nudity were removed during the editing process to avoid a conflict with the Central Board of Film Certification. Produced by Viacom18 Motion Pictures and Ishan Talkies, in association with Jakhotia Group and Adapt, the film's final cut ran for a total of 100 minutes. Bose had funded the project herself as Viacom18 covered only half the estimated 65 million production cost. Another partner withdrew financial support around ten days prior to commencement of filming. Bose had to apply for a personal loan to pay the bills, but was able to complete the film with support from the crew members, who agreed to their payments being delayed. The international distribution rights for Margarita with a Straw were acquired by Wide Management, a Paris-based sales-production-distribution house.  Soundtrack  Music director and singer Mikey McCleary composed the soundtrack for Margarita with a Straw, with Joi Barua serving as the guest composer for both versions of the song \\"Dusokute\\". The lyrics for the album were written primarily by Prasoon Joshi, except for the tracks \\"I Need a Man\\" and \\"Don't Go Running Off Anytime Soon\\", the latter featuring English lyrics written by McCleary. Artists such as Sharmistha Chatterjee, Sonu Kakkar, Anushka Manchanda, Rachel Varghese, Vivienne Pocha, and Rajnigandha Shekhawat provided vocals for the album on various tracks. The first track to be released, the soft rock number \\"Dusokute\\", was originally composed by Barua in Assamese and was rewritten in Hindi by Joshi. In April 2015, the complete soundtrack was released under the Zee Music Company label. Critics such as Kasmin Fernandes and Joginder Tuteja gave positive reviews of the soundtrack's unconventional style. The former appreciated Barua's \\"energetic vocals\\" in \\"Dusokute\\" and the \\"desi yet classy\\" number \\"Foreign Balamwa\\" in her 3-out-of-5-star review for The Times of India. She described the lyrics by Joshi as \\"cheerful\\", but was less impressed by McCleary's \\"passable\\" writing. Tuteja, writing for Bollywood Hungama, noted the album's lack of a commercial appeal and wrote that at best it \\"fit[s] in well into the stage and setting that the film stands for\\". He praised McCleary's command of the English compositions and his \\"boyish charm\\" as a vocalist. Tuteja was particularly impressed by Pocha's \\"thumping vocals\\" in \\"I Need a Man\\" and the serene effect of the final two tracks of the album. He also found the choice of such artists as Manchanda and Kakkar odd for what he described as an album heavily influenced by Western music. Bryan Durham of the Daily News and Analysis considered the duo's respective tracks \\"unusual\\" and \\"candid\\". He singled out the instrumental number, \\"Laila's Theme\\", as \\"the beating heart of the film\\".  Release  Margarita with a Straw premiered worldwide at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, where it received a standing ovation. The event was attended by the cast and crew, including Bose and Koechlin; the latter said that she was overwhelmed by the response and \\"loved to see the audiences cry and laugh with the movie\\". The film was subsequently screened at film festivals across Europe, including the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, the BFI London Film Festival, the Galway Film Fleadh, the Vesoul Festival of Asian Cinema, and the Giffoni International Film Festival. Margarita with a Straw had its American premiere at the 2015 Palm Springs International Film Festival. It was screened in Castro Theater at CAAMFest, and shown at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival later that year. The film opened the 2015 New York Indian Film Festival, and also featured at the 19th Busan International Film Festival and the Istanbul Film Festival. Out on Film, Miami Gay & Lesbian Film Festival, and Reeling were among the LGBT events that screened the production. After garnering acclaim at the international film festival circuit, the producers of Margarita with a Straw sent it straight to the Central Board of Film Certification. The decision to not send it to any of the major Indian film festivals was looked upon by commentators such as Uma Da Cunha, editor for Film India Worldwide, as a part of a marketing strategy. Srinivasan Narayan, organiser of the Mumbai International Film Festival said that while Indian film festivals have grown, they have not yet reached a level where they can compete for international premieres. Instead, Margarita with a Straw had pre-released screenings for members of the Indian film industry in Mumbai. Along with the cast and crew of the production, these showings were variously attended by Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Kiran Rao, Vidya Balan, Anurag Kashyap, and Shraddha Kapoor. The film was positively received at the time; Bollywood personalities including Khan and Hrithik Roshan hosted separate special screenings for the film. Ahead of its commercial release, the crew organised several promotional events. In an interview with the Indo-Asian News Service, Koechlin talked about the importance of marketing for an independent film, saying that although the content of the films is becoming better, Bollywood remains an industry largely driven by box office gains. Bose wanted the film to be marketed as a commercial one despite its art house appeal; she was not very keen on sending it to film festivals and later asked the producers to avoid mentioning the accolades that the film had won at any of the promotional events. The official trailer was released on 4 March 2015 on Viacom18 Motion Pictures' official YouTube channel. First look posters featuring Koechlin sipping margaritas using a drinking straw were also unveiled on the same day. The film was released theatrically in India on 17 April 2015. It is available on Netflix.  Reception  = Critical reception = Margarita with a Straw received positive reviews, with some describing the film as \\"wonderfully liberating\\" and \\"an achievement [for Indian cinema]\\". Particular praise was directed towards Koechlin's performance and Bose's sensitive depiction of cerebral palsy. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV lauded the honest depiction of disability and was pleased with how Laila's handicap eventually ceases to matter. Baradwaj Rangan similarly found Bose's treatment of disability and normalcy refreshing: according to Rangan, \\"there's not a trace of stereotype, not a shred of self-pity\\" in the characterisation, and the most remarkable thing is that \\"Laila isn't a differently abled person. She's a person who is differently abled [...] human being comes first, the condition only later\\". Firstposts Deepanjana Pal was especially impressed by the sex scenes, which conveyed a \\"tenderness towards the on-screen lovers\\" without being weird or coy. National Film Awardalt=Kalki Koechlin smiling at the camera. Koechlin's performance as Laila drew a lot attention from film critics, who variously attributed her screen appeal to the lack of acting pretence and her \\"understated artistry\\". Venky Vembu of The Hindu wrote that Koechlin lent \\"such verisimilitude to her portrayal of a person with cerebral palsy, that you forget [...] that she's an able-bodied actress\\". Writing for The Commercial Appeal, John Beifuss compared Koechlin's performance to Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Stephen Hawking in the biopic The Theory of Everything (2014). He wrote that her performance would have attracted Academy Award notice in a major film studio production. This view was echoed by other writers as well. The supporting cast also received positive reviews. Revathi's \\"finely nuanced\\" portrayal of a mother was lauded, and her performance was singled out as \\"[more] compelling\\" than any other in the film. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Gary Goldstein offered a mixed response to the production, but wrote that \\"it's hard not to be captivated\\" by Koechlin's and Gupta's performances. Observers also praised the film's technical aspects, while ascribing its appeal to its script, which was \\"emotionally arresting and startlingly revelatory\\" and \\"straight from the heart\\". Bose's direction was praised for its restraint and its \\"luminous austerity\\" and the \\"expert use of emotions and moments\\". Many also highlighted the cinematography and commended Misawa for her \\"judicious work\\" and \\"charming frames lit up with an almost dream-like, soft light\\". Commentators such as Shilpa Jamkhandikar of Reuters and Mihir Fadnavis of Firstpost were critical of the change of tone and hurried narrative in the film's second half. Although the latter was pleased by the film's first half, he thought that after a \\"glorious, powerful beginning, Bose fails to figure out a proper resolution\\". Devesh Sharma was critical of the film's scattered plot in his review for Filmfare. He wrote that it \\"skips and jumps from one plot point to the other\\", leaving the viewer unsatisfied. Jamkhandikar similarly noted that Bose introduced \\"too many contrivances and conflicts\\" in the narrative. = Box office = Margarita with a Straw released in India on around 250 screens. After collecting the meagre sum of on its opening day, the figures began to grow over the following days, largely because of positive word of mouth. The film collected improved totals of on Saturday and on Sunday bringing the opening weekend collections to . It faced competition from other productions including Mr. X, and previous releases Ek Paheli Leela, and Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! in its opening weekend at the box office, but was expected to do well because of the positive reviews. The first week's numbers held steady at . The film did particularly well in urban areas like Mumbai and National Capital Region where it collected and respectively. This trend was analysed by Shobha De as marking a \\"dramatic shift in urban audiences' tastes\\". She made note of the newfound acceptance of unconventional and sexual themes in Indian cinema. Margarita with a Straw grossed a total of during its theatrical run. = Accolades = Bose won the NETPAC Award at the Toronto International Film Festival. The production was subsequently awarded the Audience and the Youth Jury prizes at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival and the Vesoul International Film Festival of Asian Cinema, respectively. Koechlin won several accolades for her performance, including the Best Actress Award at Tallinn, the Screen Award for Best Actress, and the Jury Award at the 63rd National Film Awards. She also garnered nominations for Best Actress at the Seattle International Film Festival and the Asian Film Awards. McCleary won the Best Composer Award at the latter ceremony.

The plantation house was constructed in 1837 in Greek Revival style with Creole influences, especially in the floorplan. Established in 1801, the plantation was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 20, 1991. History Bocage Plantation was established in January 1801, 5 years after √âtienne de Bor√© proved that sugarcane cultivation could be profitable in southern Louisiana and 2 years before the Louisiana Purchase. It was a wedding gift from St. James Parish planter Marius Pons Bringier to his eldest daughter, 14-year-old Francoise \\"Fanny\\" Bringier, on the occasion of her marriage to 34-year-old Parisian bon vivant Christophe Colomb. The original house, built in 1801 and destroyed by fire in or before 1837, was a \\"raised Creole house‚Äîbrick on the first floor supporting a heavy-timber frame above\\". At first, it was thought that this house was at the same site as, and the basis for, the current house, until, \\"during the process [of the 2008 restoration], the bases of four symmetrically placed chimneys[,] surrounded by charred remains and fragments of brick and broken glass [glass dating to 1800], were discovered buried about 40 feet behind the [current] house.\\" Although sources vary as to the certainty of it, the design of the current, 1837, house has been attributed to James H. Dakin, who came to Louisiana in 1835, was employed by the Bringier family, and was skilled in Greek Revival architecture. Distinctive features of the fa√ßade include the massive entablature, with pediment design on the parapet and denticulated cornice, supported across the entire front by square, giant order columns forming a double gallery. The front staircase is not original; it was added during the 2008 restoration based on the oldest known picture/watercolor painting of Bocage done at the beginning of the 20th century over 100 years prior to the new staircase being added. The upper gallery was used to film a scene in the movie \\"Twelve Years a Slave\\". The upper gallery opens into a large double parlor on the premier √©tage, where rooms open into each other, without halls, in the Creole style, with a cabinet-loggia at the rear. Giant twelve-feet-tall sliding doors separate the upper parlors when closed. The roof once served as a rainwater catch basin, with the fresh water shunted through pipes to a cistern on each side, in back of the house. After many years of neglect, the house was salvaged and restored in 1941 by Drs. E. G. Kohlsdorf and Anita Crozat (Mrs. Kohlsdorf). An auction in 2007 sold various furnishings from the house and grounds. In 2008 the house-- was further restored using up to date engineering principles and all known history by its new owner, Dr. Marion Rundell--became a B&B; which also offered public tours. The plantation was is severe disrepair in 2007 and the 2008 restoration was done to save the mansion from complete ruin. Geography Bocage Plantation is located on Louisiana Highway 942, along the River Road, in Darrow, Ascension Parish, on the east bank of the Mississippi River, but on a meander that puts it north and west of the river. The plantation is across the river from the parish seat of Donaldsonville, and about 25 miles southeast of Baton Rouge. Filming location Bocage Plantation was used as a setting for \\"Shaw Farm\\" in the 2013 film 12 Years a Slave.

(Budapest, District XIII, √öjpesti Quay Nr 5). The Raoul Wallenberg-memorial at the Doh√°ny Street Synagogue in Budapest Alberto Carlos de Liz-Teixeira Branquinho (27 January 1902 in Viseu, Portugal‚Äì ‚Ä† 1973) was a Portuguese diplomat credited with saving the lives of 1,000 Jews in Nazi-occupied Hungary during the Holocaust from Hungarian Fascists and the Nazis during the later stages of World War II. While serving as Portugal‚Äôs Charg√© d'Affaires in Budapest in 1944. Along with Sampaio Garrido, he rented houses and apartments to shelter and protect refugees from deportation and murder. They obtained permission from the Portuguese government to issue safe conducts to all persons who had relatives in Portugal, Brazil, or the Portuguese colonies or had the most remote connection to Portugal. Garrido and Branquinho also established an office of the Portuguese Red Cross at the Portuguese legation to care for Jewish refugees. This was largely done in cooperation with the Portuguese Foreign Office and under Salazar‚Äôs direct supervision with the provision that these refugees would not try to get Portuguese citizenship.Pimentel, p 343-350 On 23 April 1944 and following the German occupation of Hungary, the Portuguese ruler Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar decided to order his ambassador to return to Lisbon and leave Teixeira Branquinho as the charg√© d'affaires, in his place. Garrido's recall was done in response to a request from Britain and the United States who wanted neutral countries to downgrade their diplomatic presence in Hungary.Milgram p. 264 In direct contact with Salazar Branquinho issued protective Passports to hundreds of Jewish families. Altogether about 1,000 lives were saved due to his actions. Branquinho was recalled to Lisbon on 30 October 1944.Pimentel, p 343-350 1944 ID issued to a staff member of the Portuguese legation in occupied Hungary by Alberto Carlos de Liz-Texeira Branquinho. After the war Branquinho continued to serve his country as a diplomat, in Washington, Jakarta, Paris, Caracas, Baghdad, Teheran and the Hague, where he acted with Ambassador‚Äôs credentials. He retired in 1966. His name has been included in The Raoul Wallenberg-memorial at the Doh√°ny Street Synagogue in Budapest. Branquinho's case never gained the same level of recognition as did the Aristides de Sousa Mendes', another Portuguese diplomat credited with saving Jews from the holocaust. Branquinho's case differs from that of Sousa Mendes in several ways. He was deliberately acting to save Jews and not refugees in general. He was risking his life which was not the case with Sousa Mendes. He was in the heart of a Nazi regime, in 1944, when the holocaust was at its peek, while Sousa Mendes was at Bordeaux in 1940 long before the holocaust had started. Branquinho had full backing from Salazar. Historian Tom Gallagher argues that Branquinho's case has been largely overlooked probably owing to the fact that he was coordinating his actions with Salazar and that weakens the core argument in the Sousa Mendes legend that he was defying a tyrannical superior. Gallagher argues that the disproportionate attention given to Sousa Mendes suggests that wartime history is in danger of being used in contemporary Portugal as a political weapon.

The oldest portion of this Georgian wood frame structure was built c. 1791 by Theophilus Stanley, to serve as a tavern in the town, which was at the time vying (unsuccessfully, as it turned out) with Concord to be the state capital. It is the only surviving tavern of three that were known to be present in the town in the late 18th and early 19th century. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description and history Stanley Tavern is located in the village center of Hopkinton, on the south side of Main Street (U.S. Route 202). It is a 2¬Ω-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior. The building originally consisted of a typical five bay wide, two bay deep, Georgian house with a central chimney, to which a single story kitchen wing with rear chimney was built on. Around 1800 the roof of the kitchen wing was raised to a full two stories. A two-story wing added in 1875 was demolished during restoration of the property in the early 2000s. The oldest portion of the tavern was built in 1791 by Theophilus Stanley (1766-1827). Located next to the hall where the state legislature met in 1798, 1801, 1806, and 1807, it was one of at least three taverns that catered to the legislators during their sessions, and is the only one still standing. The building served as a tavern until 1864, and has since gone through a variety of commercial and residential uses. The property distinctively includes a shed that is as old as the main house.

History  usedSoft was founded in 2003 by Peter Schneider and two partners, though the latter two left the company later. Business operations were launched in 2004. At that time, the company's headquarters were located in Munich. After initial skepticism ‚Äî contrary to de facto legal circumstances, the market was long plagued by the belief that used software was not tradeable ‚Äî the company has attained double-digit growth rates again and again. This, however, led to growing and significant opposition from the software manufacturers in the US. In 2006, Microsoft went so far as to file a criminal complaint, which was dropped by Munich's General State Prosecutor on the grounds of proven innocence. In 2005, Oracle attempted to halt used software trade with a civil lawsuit. This endeavor also failed but ultimately lead to an EU-wide liberalization of used software trade (see below, \\"ECJ Ruling\\").  Business model  usedSoft purchases and sells standard computer programs that have already been used by other users. Since it does not suffer from wear, contrary to other products, software retains the same quality as brand new products. Licenses on the used market are available for around 30 percent below the price on new software. usedSoft also purchases used software. That means companies can turn software they no longer require (due to system changes, reduction of workstations, etc.) into liquidity. Such purchases are subject to notarial monitoring. usedSoft mainly deals in all standard computer programs of Microsoft brands. There are plans to expand the used software model to include the standard software of other manufacturers as well, especially Adobe, SAP, and Oracle. usedSoft maintains business operations exclusively in Europe. Its customer base includes large companies, SMEs, and public agencies, including Edeka, Woolworth, Harry Broth, s.Oliver, Segafredo, the airports of Munich and Salzburg, law firms, an association in Germany's Bundesliga soccer league, savings and loans banks, as well as the City of Munich, Germany's Federal Social Court in Kassel, and the Thuringia Police.References. Accessed on 14 March 2014.  Legal foundation  The legal foundation for used software trade consists of the \\"principle of exhaustion\\" in copyright law. This principle lays out that a manufacturer's distribution right to a product is \\"exhausted\\" the first time it brings the product into circulation. Thus, the buyer can resell the product secondhand. In Europe, EU Directive 2009/24/EC expressly permits trading used computer programs.Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and the Council. Official Journal of the European Union Accessed on 14 March 2014.  ECJ ruling  Since 2005, Oracle and usedSoft have carried out a legal dispute in Germany on the question of whether usedSoft is permitted to trade used Oracle licenses. The dispute was taken all the way to Germany‚Äôs Federal Court of Justice, the country‚Äôs highest court, which ultimately passed the case to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for adjudication. The ECJ's ruling was announced on 3 July 2012 (case C-128/11). The ECJ ruled, barring further recourse for appeal, that the principle of exhaustion applies to every first- time sale of software. Thus, used software trade has been declared fundamentally legal. According to the Court, this also applies to software that has been transmitted online. The ECJ even laid out that the second acquirer of computer programs that have been transmitted online may download the software from the manufacturer: according to the ECJ.

The bridge was built circa 1896-7 to carry the tracks of the Boston and Maine Railroad across the Winnipesaukee River between Franklin and Tilton. The bridge is believed to be the only surviving \\"upside down\\" covered railroad bridge in the United States, in which the rail bed is laid on top of the bridge roof, whose purpose is to shelter the trusses below. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The bridge, unused since 1973, is not in good condition, having been subjected to graffiti, vandalism, and arson, as well as the elements. Description and history The Sulphite Railroad Bridge is located about east of downtown Franklin, and about south of US Route 3, and crosses the river at a point where its banks are quite steep; it is not readily visible from any roadway, but may be seen from the Winnipesaukee River Trail. The bridge is long, and consists of three spans, each supported by Pratt trusses resting on granite piers or abutments. The main central span measures . The bridge was built about 1896-7 by the Boston and Maine Railroad, replacing a standard trestle bridge built in 1892 by the Franklin and Tilton Railroad. The bridge acquired its name for the large amount of sulfite carried by the rail line to paper mills in Franklin. The mills, which were the principal users of the line, closed in the 1920s, and another covered bridge on the line, crossing the Merrimack River, was washed away by flooding in 1936. The railroad line was shut down entirely in 1973. The bridge is believed to be the only surviving \\"upside down\\" covered railroad bridge, in which the rail bed is laid on top of the bridge roof, whose purpose is to shelter the trusses below.

Accessed 2010-04-17.http://www.taglineguru.com/monikerlist.html or Rose City. The first known reference to Portland as \\"The City of Roses\\" was made by visitors to an 1888 Episcopal Church convention. In 1889, the Portland Rose Society was founded, and promoted the planting of 20 miles (32 km) of Portland's streets with roses in advance of the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. The nickname grew in popularity after the exposition, where Mayor Harry Lane suggested that the city needed a \\"festival of roses.\\" The nickname is often attributed to Leo Samuel,StanCorp Financial History Page who founded the Oregon Life Insurance Company in 1906 (known today as Standard Insurance Company). Samuel, who moved to Portland in 1871,Answers.com History of StanCorp Financial Group grew roses outside his home. He placed a pair of shears outside his garden so people could snip a rose from his garden to take for themselves. This encouraged other people and businesses to plant their own roses outside their homes and business. Today, roses are still planted outside the Standard Insurance Company's home office building in downtown Portland. The first Portland Rose Festival was held in 1907, and remains the city's major annual festival more than a century later. In 1917, the International Rose Test Garden was established, and it now features more than 7,000 rose plants of 550 varieties. It is the oldest continuously operating public rose test garden in the United States. The \\"City of Roses\\" nickname inspired the name for the four-year-old female Asian elephant who arrived in 1953, Rosy. The first elephant ever to live in Oregon, she remained the matriarch of the Oregon Zoo's herd and gave birth to six calves before her death in 1993.\\"Elephant matriarch Rosy dies at 43\\".

On June 18, 2003, the city council unanimously approved a resolution adopting \\"City of Roses\\" as the city's official nickname. =Stumptown= Stumptown was coined in a period of phenomenal growth in Portland after 1847. The city was growing so rapidly that the stumps of trees were left behind until manpower could be spared to remove them. In some areas the stumps remained for so long that locals whitewashed them to make them more visible. They also used them to cross the street without sinking into the mud. Captain John C. Ainsworth commented that there were \\"more stumps than trees\\" in Portland in the early 1850s.MacColl cites the \\"4 March 1877, entry in 'Autobiographical Account', John C. Ainsworth Papers, OHS; Oregonian; 4 December 1900\\" =Rip City= The nickname Rip City is usually used in the context of the city's NBA team, the Portland Trail Blazers. The term was coined by the team's play-by-play announcer Bill Schonely during a game against the Los Angeles Lakers on February 18, 1971, the Blazers' first season. In the days prior to the three-point field goal, Blazers guard Jim Barnett took an ill-advised long distance shot that nonetheless went in, giving the new team hope for a victory against the powerful Lakers. Excited, Schonely exclaimed \\"Rip City Baby!\\" Schonely admits that he has no idea how he came up with the expression, but it became synonymous with the team and the city of Portland. =Beervana= This nickname reflects Portland's wide variety of craft beers brewed in Portland and throughout the state of Oregon.Beervana opb.orgFreewheeling Portland, Oregon USA Today, 2008-08-14 =PDX= The city of Portland is nicknamed PDX after the International Air Transport Association airport code for the Portland International Airport which is within the city limits.

It reads, \\"On the Pacific coast, Portland occupies the same relative position as that of Brooklyn on the Atlantic seaboard and might well be called \\"a city of churches\\"...Wherever the stranger wanders here he will see steeples pointing heavenward, in the very midst of one of the most pleasing landscapes in all the world, embracing, as it does the comprehensive view of river and vale, hill and mountain, farm and fruit orchard, city and country--all combined.\\" =Little Beirut= Staffers of former U.S. President George H.

He is also a leader of several prominent progressive political campaigns. Early life and education Zuckerman attended the Chadwick School in Los Angeles County, California, and graduated from Reed College with a degree in biology in 2003. As a student at Reed, Zuckerman served on the editorial board of the Reed College Quest, a student-run newspaper. In March 2002 he wrote an opinion piece in The Oregonian (\\"The drug Olympics\\") condemning competitive use of drugs like gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, or GHB, at the school. He was the target of numerous threats within the Reed College community, and he was both adversely criticized and also praised in letters to the Oregonian. Zuckerman interned for the Portland weekly Just Out while at Reed, delivering the paper and fact-checking telephone numbers.Just Out Writers, from A (Acito) to Z (Zuckerman) Just Out He also interned for the Portland bureau of the Associated Press and The Springfield News. He went on to work as a journalist in Eastern Idaho.http://web.reed.edu/career/calendar/2008/October/Where-the-Jobs-Are- Journalism.html Career = Journalism = In 2006, Zuckerman was the lead writer of a controversial multi-part story, Scouts' Honor, in the Idaho Falls Post Register about the coverup of a multi-state child molestation case involving at least two dozen minors and the Boy Scouts of America in Idaho. He was accused of having a bias against the Boy Scouts of America and the LDS Church because of his sexual orientation. For work on the series, Zuckerman received the 2006 Livingston Award and the 2007 C.B. Blethen Award, and the Post-Register won the Scripps Foundation's 2005 National Journalism Awards for distinguished service to the First Amendment. After the story was published, Zuckerman became the target of personal attacks on the basis of his sexual orientation. Zuckerman was profiled in a September 25, 2007, documentary, \\"In A Small Town,\\" broadcast in the PBS series, Expos√©: America's Investigative Reports. The documentary was a nominated for an Emmy Award.

In this article, Men Sue Scouts, Mormon Church, six men allege a former troop leader and church teacher abused them and seek $25 million in compensation as the LDS church failed to thoroughly investigate, report the abuse to law enforcement, provide mental health services to victims or remove the abuser from contact with children once it learned about the abuse. Zuckerman later changed his reporting to focus on stories that had more of an environmental bent. For example, he wrote about the Forest Service loosening its environmental standards so a gas corporation can clear cut through old growth in the Mount Hood National Forest to make way for an LNG pipeline. In 2020, Zuckerman and his journalism were the subject of a documentary that premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. =Writing= In January 2009, Zuckerman took a leave from The Oregonian to work on a \\"dream book project\\" after his partner, Sam Adams, was elected mayor of Portland http://byronbeckwindow.ning.com/profiles/blogs/breaking-media-news-peter While researching the book, Zuckerman nearly died while traveling through remote regions of Nepal and ingesting a \\"half plant, half animal\\" caterpillar fungus.

The anti-gay measure would have created an exception to Oregon's anti-discrimination law, allowing businesses deny service because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. During the marriage campaign, support for gay marriage increased by 14 points, volunteers collected 160,000 signatures to put gay marriage on the ballot, and the marriage campaign raised $3 million. Later that year, Zuckerman went on to become the communications director for New Approach Oregon / Yes on 91, the campaign to legalize recreational use of marijuana in Oregon (Measure 91).http://www.newapproachoregon.com/contact/ The campaign followed perennial, unsuccessful efforts to legalize marijuana by ballot initiative, including in 1986 and in 2012, which made it to the ballot, but voters had rejected. Marijuana legalization in Oregon passed with 56 percent of the vote, making Oregon the third state to legalize marijuana. Drug policy advocates described the victory as a major turning point in the drug reform movement.https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/11/12/pot-legalization- gateway-to-what In 2016, Zuckerman directed communications for 2016 Oregon Ballot Measure 98, to provide more funding for education.

The civic district is a area on the Pembroke side of the river, adjacent to the Pembroke Mill, a site that had seen industrial use since the 18th century. The district includes 21 commercial buildings, 19 of which are historically significant. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. The Suncook area was settled in the late 1730s, and small-scale industrial works along the river were an early feature, with a sawmill and gristmill being followed by a fulling mill in the 1700s. The area did not begin to grow substantially until the 1830s, when the first textile mills began to be built there in 1814, although it did benefit from the presence first of ferry services and then bridges, placing the nascent village on major travel routes. Declining agricultural income and rising factory income led to the growth of the commercial center adjacent to the mill complexes that lined the river. In the 1850s the arrival of railroads spurred further growth. By the 1860s Main Street and Glass Street were lined with wood frame commercial buildings. Fires in this area in the 1870s resulted in significant changes to the village. One fire in 1876 destroyed much of Main Street's west side, while a second destroyed much of the east side two years later. The town of Pembroke widened the street, and a significant number of brick buildings were built along Main Street. Many of the buildings in the district were built in the wake of these fires, and exhibit some Italian and Renaissance Revival styling that was popular at that time. The most architecturally interesting is the Clock Tower building at 116 Main Street, which occupies a prominent place overlooking the river, and whose four-story clock tower is the tallest structure in the village.

Hach (pronounced h…ë:k). She was essential to the company's expansion, flying her own plane to small airfields across the country to sell water purification kits. She became president, chief operating officer, and CEO of the Hach company. Kathryn Hach-Darrow was also the first woman director of the American Water Works Association, an international non-profit working for better water quality. She has been noted for philanthropic work as well as entrepreneurship, and has received a number of awards and honors. Early life and education Kathryn Carter was born in Bucklin, Missouri, where her father was an automobile dealer. He was also a pilot, flying his own Eagle Rock biplane. Kitty's first ride in an airplane occurred at the age of 5, the beginning of her lifelong love of flying. Her mother was a schoolteacher. The Great Depression was financially disastrous for the Carter family. Her father did not go bankrupt, but lost his business and his plane. The family bought a farm in Triplett, Missouri and lived there during Kathryn's teens. Kathryn did well in school and earned money for college by raising and selling turkeys. She initially attended Columbia College, Missouri (then named Christian Female College), before transferring to Iowa State University to study home economics. At Iowa State University, Kitty met Nellie May Naylor, a chemist in the home economics department who interested her in chemistry. Marriage and work Kathryn and her first husband Clifford C. Hach met as students at Iowa State University, and married in 1943. \\"I knew right away that this guy was going to build a chemical company,\\" she says. \\"He didn't care how big Dow was or how big DuPont was, he was going to build his own company.\\" Clifford did not receive his bachelor's degree until 1947, because he and other students were co-opted to work on war-time projects at the university. It was difficult to find jobs after graduation. Eventually Clifford was hired part-time by a filtration company in Ames, Iowa to analyze water. Seeing how the water- treatment plant worked gave Clifford the idea for a process and a product: a simplified method of analysis that would enable workers to treat water with powdered formulas rather than heavy chemical solutions. He raised startup money by selling the rights to another invention. The Walter Kidde fire extinguisher company had approached the University of Iowa for ideas for generating carbon dioxide to fight fires. Clifford came up with a patentable idea, and sold it to the fire company for $15,000. With the money the Hachs co-founded Hach Chemical Company in 1947. They bought an acre of land in Ames, Iowa, and built a cement block building which became their plant. They lived with their three children in a small apartment at the plant. Clifford Hach was in charge of research and development while Kitty handled management and marketing. Their first successful product was a simplified titration method for measuring hardness in drinking water, which they packaged in easy-to-use testing kits. As municipal standards for drinking water were developed, Kitty recognized both the importance of water plant operators as a market, and the need to work closely with them to develop standards and provide long-term customer service. She developed a direct mail marketing campaign, and earned the nickname \\"Kitty\\" Hach by flying her plane across the United States, sometimes landing on rural dirt airstrips in bad weather, delivering water quality testing kits to municipalities of all sizes. She became a member of the Ninety-Nines, an international organization of licensed women pilots, and accumulated over 7,000 hours flying time. She was rated for multi-engine and instrument flying. Kathryn Hach became the first woman director of the American Water Works Association, an international non-profit, scientific and educational association founded to improve water quality and supply throughout the world. She later served on numerous AWWA committees, including the President's Advisory Council. Hach Chemical Company Hach Water Purification Testing Hach Classroom Drinking Water Testing Kit Hach Chemical was instrumental in standardizing water-purification tests and pioneered many world-standard analytical instruments. Their tests were designed to be simple and effective, with nontechnical directions that made their products easy for both chemists and non-chemists to use. As of 2012, about 70 percent of municipalities in the United States used Hach Company instrumentation, allowing them to detect impurities in water at the parts-per-billion level. Hach Chemical Company was incorporated in 1951, went public in 1968. The company moved its headquarters to Loveland, Colorado, in 1978, and was renamed Hach Company in 1980. Under Kitty Hach's management, the company developed an employee base of over 900 people and became one of the top women owned businesses in the United States. Kathryn Hach-Darrow was president, chief operating officer, and CEO of the Hach company. After Clifford's death in 1990, Kitty was named Hach Co.'s chairman and CEO and her son Bruce assumed the role of president. In 1995, she married Donald Darrow, a retired airline pilot, becoming Kitty Hach-Darrow. In 1999, Kitty and her son Bruce sold the Hach company to Danaher Corporation.

The book's main character is Carmolina BellaCasa and the book is centered on her family. The primary relationship in the novel is between the main character and Doria, her grandmother. Other characters include Carmolina's father and mother and her ill older sister. Story The book's chapters consist of the Prelude, Parts I-VI, and an Epilogue.Bona, p. 95-96 (JSTOR PDF 10-11/21). Mary Jo Bona, author of \\"Broken Images, Broken Lives: Carmolina's Journey in Tina De Rosa's Paper Fish,\\" described the novel as having an \\"unconventional\\" structure and a circular form.Bona, p. 96 (JSTOR PDF 11/21). The prelude is narrated in the first- person by Carmolina, who is unborn at this point. After the prelude the story uses the third-person narrative form. Part I, \\"The Memory,\\" describes the childhood memories of Doria and the lives of Carmolina's parents. Part II, \\"Summer 1949 ‚Äì Late July,\\" chronicles the efforts of residents of Carmolina's neighborhood in searching for her, since she has run away from home. A meeting in the kitchen of the BellaCasa house occurs at the end of the scene. Bona wrote that Doria \\"dominates\\" the kitchen scene. Part III, \\"The Family,\\" chronicles Doria's life when she had been recently married. It also has a section about the marriage of Carmolina's parents. The destruction of the BellaCasa family residence by a fire takes place in this chapter. Part IV, \\"Summer 1949 ‚Äì Early June\\" describes Doriana's illness, the lives of the residents of Carmolina's neighborhood, and Carmolina's observations of area gypsies. In this chapter the family considers institutionalizing Doriana. Fearing that if the family sends Doriana away, she may be sent away too, Carmolina makes herself become ill to end the family meeting. Carmolina decides to run away from home, and in Part V, \\"Summer 1949 ‚Äì Late July,\\" she goes on a streetcar and goes to a neighborhood described by Bona as \\"unfriendly to ethnics.\\" The chapter includes Carmolina's recollections of conversations between herself and her grandmother. Bona wrote that the recollections \\"clarify her understanding of herself and Doriana's illness.\\" Doriana has a high fever in this chapter; Bona wrote that this occurs \\"as though [Doriana is] cognizant of Carmolina's absence\\". The police discover Carmolina and return her to her household, where Carmolina becomes ill with a malady similar to Doriana's. The final part takes place nine years after the previous chapter. In Part VI, \\"Summer 1958\\", Carmolina and Doria have a ritual ceremony. Bona wrote that \\"In this symbolic scene, Carmolina receives a legacy of selfhood.\\" The immigrant community in Carmolina's neighborhood is forced to move away in the book's epilogue.

Mary Jo Bona, author of \\"Broken Images, Broken Lives: Carmolina's Journey in Tina De Rosa's Paper Fish,\\" wrote that Carmolina \\"uses her grandmother's memories of the homeland as the subjective topography for her own fertile imagination\\" and that the interspersing of the past and present \\"reinforces the usefulness of the past for\\" Carmolina.Bona, p. 92 (JSTOR PDF 7/21). * Doriana BellaCasa ** Carmolina's older sister, Doriana, has an illness. The family speculates about the reasons why the older sister is ill, but the novel never states the cause of the illness. In the novel, Doriana does not recover from the illness, she does not die from the illness, and she is not sent to a sanatorium.Bona, p. 94 (JSTOR PDF 9/21). *** Ann LoLordo of the Baltimore Sun describes the sister as \\"a strange spirit hovering in the family flat\\". Bona wrote that \\"Though it is true that Italians in America have been traditionally resistant to the idea of institutionalizing family members, the sick characters\\" present in several other novels \\"do not remain an integral, compelling part of the text as the first daughter, Doriana, does in Paper Fish.\\" LoLordo wrote that \\"DeRosa never fully explores the effect of this damaged child on Carmolina\\" and that \\"I understand that this family can't articulate their loss, but DeRosa can and doesn't.\\" * Marco BellaCasa ** Marco is Carmolina's father.

In 1977 De Rosa gave a reading from a draft of her work. After her reading, the head of the Chicago publishing company Wine Press, Jim Ramholz, approached De Rosa and offered to publish it. By 1980 he had received a grant from the Illinois Arts Council and he used this grant to publish the book. The initial press run was for 1,000 copies. Months after the book was first published, it went out of print.Giunta, p. 123. At the time the book was first published, De Rosa was in her 30s. An excerpt of Paper Fish was re-printed in The Dream Book: An Anthology of Writings by Italian American Women by Helen Barolini. This 1985 anthology had works from 56 writers, all Italian-American women.Bona. p. 87 [2/21 of JSTOR PDF file]. Lauerman wrote that the book had become unknown after the print run ended, and Edvige Giunta, the author of the afterword of the 2002 Feminist Press printing of Paper Fish, stated that the novel was mostly \\"excluded from literary history\\" and that it and De Rosa \\"remained in the shadows for fifteen years.\\" Lauerman had stated that \\"Only a handful of Italian-American scholars kept \\"Paper Fish\\" alive by mentioning it in dissertations and essays and circulating photocopies of it.\\" Some academics had used this book as part of courses on Italian-American culture, and so their students could read the book they distributed photocopies of the novel to them. Fred Gardaph√©, a professor at Columbia College Chicago, had given the novel a favorable review when it first came out. In June 1995 he sat next to the director of the Feminist Press, Florence Howe, while attending a working class studies conference in Ohio. Gardaph√© discussed the novel with Howe, and he gave her a copy. This resulted in the re-publishing by the Feminist Press. It was published in Italian, as Pesci di carta, by . Analysis Mary Jo Bona wrote an article about the book that was published by MELUS, the academic journal by The Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States. The 1987 article discusses how the novel intertwines its three issues. Paper Fish had explored illness, ethnicity, and gender. Reception Lauerman wrote that when the book was first published, \\"people turned [De Rosa's] head, telling her she was brilliant, a genius.\\" A portion of the manuscript, which had been pre-published, received a nomination for the Carl Sandburg Award. The Sandburg Award is a literary prize from the Friends of the Chicago Public Library given out every year. Fred Gardaph√© was the first critic to review the novel. His review was published in the American Italian Historical Newsletter. Gardaph√© stated that he felt so \\"astonished\\" when the first read it and that he bought as many copies as possible so he could distribute them to his friends. Writer Louise DeSalvo gave a quote to Florence Howe for the book jacket, stating that Paper Fish was \\"the best Italian- American novel by a woman in this century\\". Howe stated that when she first sent a copy of the book to writer to DeSalvo, DeSalvo was astonished that she had not heard of the book before.

The terrain generally slopes upward toward the west, with the oldest developed portions of the cemetery at its highest points. The circulating pattern consists of winding paved and gravel roads, laid out to follow contours of the terrain, and grassy paths between the rows of gravesites. Special areas of the cemetery include the Beth Jacob Cemetery, laid out in 1948 for Jewish interments, and a section containing a memorial to the Grand Army of the Republic, honoring the city's Civil War dead. The cemetery was founded in 1860 and was the city's second, after the Old North Cemetery. It was designed by John C. Briggs, who died at the age of 41 and is buried here. The cemetery is the final resting place of city and state leaders, including four governors. Calvary Cemetery Calvary Cemetery occupies , immediately adjacent to and north of Blossom Hill. The two cemeteries now have integrated landscaping, Calvary having been managed and maintained by the city since its founding. It was established in 1875, a decade after the founding of St. John the Evangelist Church. Its burials include the first Catholic priest to serve Concord, Rev. John O'Reilly, who died in 1855 and whose remains were moved here from Manchester in the 1890s, and Rev. John Barry, under whose auspices the cemetery was established.

Overview The documentary explores Hitler's upbringing and efforts during World War II and includes footage from this time period. It also contains interviews and statements from military historians and veterans, and looks into what mistakes Hitler made during the war and what he could have potentially done differently in order to win.

Sydnor Junior, German-American historian Reception Critical reception for How Hitler Lost the War was mostly positive. Entertainment Weekly gave the movie a B- but commented that the film's thesis was \\"dubious\\". The Chicago Sun-Times praised the documentary and called it \\"a fascinating re-examination of the misdirection of one of the greatest war machines the world has ever known\\". In contrast, the New York Times stated that the film was \\"sporadically interesting but far from persuasive\\" and noted that it lacked a contrary analysis of the material. The Los Angeles Times criticized How Hitler Lost the War for containing several pieces of misinformation and for also never fully realizing its potential, as they felt that the final portion of the documentary was a \\"superficial rehash of how German designers made a jet plane and other advances toward the end of the war --not exactly hot news to anyone who's read the war's history.\\"  Re-Release  It has since been re-released onto DVD in 2012 (Region 1, NTSC), by Varied Directions.

Bibian Mentel won the paralympic gold in the snowboard cross discipline in the 2014 and 2018 Paralympic Winter Games, as well as banked slalom in 2018, despite battling cancer nine times since the beginning of the century, and winning her 2018 medals at age 45. Mentel co-wrote two books about her life, career and struggles with cancer, and set up her own \\"Mentelity\\" foundation. In 2012, Mentel was invested as a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau. Career Mentel started her snowboard career in 1993. In 1996 she participated in her first FIS Snowboard World Cup competition. Mentel became six times Dutch champion in the regular, able-bodied half-pipe and snowboard cross disciplines, before being struck by medical troubles.This statement translated from Dutch wikipedia article During a practice run for the championships in Breckenridge, Colorado in December 1999, she suffered an injury in her ankle. She completed the season, however the ankle remained a source of concern. X-rays showed a spot on her tibia which was diagnosed as a malignant bone tumor. The tumor was removed and Mentel started training for the 2002 Winter Olympics for which she qualified. Soon it became clear the tumor had regrown and had a chance of spreading to the rest of her body via her blood. She chose to have her leg amputated. Four months after the amputation she was able to ride a snowboard again, despite still being unable to walk using crutches. The following January she was asked to present the trophy at the Dutch championships halfpipe. She decided to compete in the Dutch snowboard cross championships, which she won ‚Äî in the main class ‚Äî not the handicapped, ‚Äì her seventh Dutch championship.Bibian Mentel ‚Äì One-legged Wonder (in Dutch) This inspired Mentel to work with Dutch member of the International Paralympic Committee Rita van Driel to get snowboarding adopted as a medal event at the paralympic Winter Games. After eight years of lobbying this was achieved in 2012. In 2013 Mentel qualified for the 2014 Winter Paralympics. At the opening ceremony she was the flag bearer for the Netherlands. She won the Paralympic gold medal in the snowboard cross event. In the winter season prior to the 2018 Winter Paralympics in PyeongChang, Mentel was unable to participate in a single competition due to medical complications. Due to her condition, most sponsors had given up on her, the Dutch Olympic Committee*Dutch Sports Federation did not support her, and the Dutch Skiing sports federation would only fund a small portion of her expenses. Mentel was able to obtain the required funds to compete at the 2018 Winter Paralympics through crowdfunding. At the 2018 Winter Paralympics in PyeongChang, Mentel was once again the Dutch flag bearer, again winning the gold medal in the snowboard cross, as well as taking the gold medal on the banked slalom event, beating American competitor Brittani Coury by 0.07 seconds. Ongoing fight against cancer Since being diagnosed with cancer at age 27, Mentel has been confronted with, and treated against cancer nine times, including five surgeries. The most recent surgery, in January 2018, replaced her C6 neck vertebra with a titanium frame. In 2016 she was told the cancer was terminal, but a switch to different hospital, where she could receive advanced MRI-guided radiotherapy treatment, pulled her through, such that she was able to compete successfully in 2018. Mentel co-wrote two books about her life, career and struggles with cancer. Magnate and philanthropist Richard Branson called her second book \\"Kut kanker!\\" loosely translated as \\"Cancer is Crap!\\" a \\"Story of an amazing woman. A must read for anyone who wants to enjoy life to the max\\".Kutkanker ‚Äì Splint Media Education In 1993 Mentel gave up her lawschool study in Amsterdam to focus on snowboarding entirely. In 2004 Mentel graduated from the 4-year high-level professional program in 'commercial economics, sports marketing & management' at the Randstad Topsports Academy ‚Äì a collaboration of the Hogeschool Rotterdam and the Saxion University of Applied Sciences, and in 2013 she became an 'International Master of Sport Management' at the Johan Cruyff Institute. Mentelity foundation and other activities In 2012 Mentel set up her own \\"Mentelity foundation\\", to stimulate, motivate, and inspire children and adolescents with a physical disability (to continue) to engage in sports, both in general, as well as in extreme board sports in particular. By this approach, and aided by the foundation's volunteers, she wants to make a positive contribution to the mental and physical development of the physically handicapped. Mentel also works as a motivational speaker, in the Dutch and English language; and occasionally teaches at a wakeboarding school.

He enjoyed little apparent success, but one of his dramas played a part in the campaign of the Syncretic Society to lift licensing restrictions in London, and have more serious and new drama performed. Life Stephens was born at Chelsea, London on 8 March 1800; much of his life remains obscure. In later life he suffered reverses of fortune. He died at Pratt Terrace, Camden Town, London, on 15 October 1851. His widow Ellen died on 11 August 1866, aged 56. They had a son and daughter. Works Three works published under the pseudonym of St. John Dorset have been thought early productions by Stephens. At least two of them, The Vampire: a tragedy, 1821, and Montezuma: a tragedy, 1822, have also been taken to have been written by Hugo John Belfour; and the third, a volume of poems, to be a joint production of Belfour and Stephens. In 1835 Stephens published The Manuscript of Erd√©ly, a romance, 3 vols. This was followed by The Voice of the Pulpit, being Sermons on various subjects, 1839 (preface dated Bromley Hall, Herts, 28 November 1838); Gertrude and Beatrice, or the Queen of Hungary: a tragedy in five acts, 1839; and P√®re La Chaise, or the Confessor, 1840, 3 vols. On 26 August 1841 Stephens saw his tragedy Martinuzzi, or the Hungarian Daughter produced at the English Opera House. Martinuzzi was an attempt, backed by the \\"Syncretic Society\\" of litterateurs, to break an existing monopoly in theatrical London. By the device of introducing songs, it was gratuitously converted into a musical drama, to get round the law which limited the performance of five-act dramas to the three \\"patent houses\\" and the Haymarket Theatre. Samuel Phelps and Mary Amelia Warner took the main roles, and the piece kept the stage for a month, though the critics were not impressed. In 1846 Stephens wrote Dramas for the Stage, two privately printed volumes containing Nero, Forgery, Sensibility, and Philip Basil, or a Poet's Fate, four tragedies; Self-Glorification, a Chinese play; and Rebecca and her Daughter, a comedy. He also wrote the introduction to the Church of England Quarterly Review, 1837, with an article, \\"The Slumber of the Pulpit\\". Other works were The Patriot, a tragedy, 1849; and The Justification of War as the Medium of Civilisation, 1850.

The picture labeled \\"graft polymer\\" shows how grafted chains of species B are covalently bonded to polymer species A. Although the side chains are structurally distinct from the main chain, the individual grafted chains may be homopolymers or copolymers. Graft polymers have been synthesized for many decades and are especially used as impact resistant materials, thermoplastic elastomers, compatibilizers, or emulsifiers for the preparation of stable blends or alloys. One of the more well known examples of a graft polymer is high impact polystyrene, which consists of a polystyrene backbone with polybutadiene grafted chains. The graft copolymer consists of a main polymer chain or backbone (A) covalently bonded to one or more side chains (B) General properties Graft copolymers are a branched copolymer where the components of the side chain are structurally different than that of the main chain. Graft copolymers containing a larger quantity of side chains are capable of wormlike conformation, compact molecular dimension, and notable chain end effects due to their confined and tight fit structures. The preparation of graft copolymers has been around for decades. All synthesis methods can be employed to create general physical properties of graft copolymers. They can be used for materials that are impact resistant, and are often used as thermoplastics elastomers, compatibilizers or emulsifiers for the preparation of stable blends or alloys. Generally, grafting methods for copolymer synthesis results in materials that are more thermostable than their homopolymer counterparts. There are three methods of synthesis, grafting to, grafting from, and grafting through, that are used to construct a graft polymer. Synthesis methods There are many different approaches to synthesizing graft copolymers. Usually they employ familiar polymerization techniques that are commonly used such as atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), anionic and cationic polymerizations, and free radical living polymerization. Some other less common polymerization include radiation-induced polymerization, ring-opening olefin metathesis polymerization, polycondensation reactions, and iniferter- induced polymerization. The three common methods of synthesis: grafting to (top left), grafting from (middle right), grafting through (bottom left), and their generalized reaction scheme are featured. =Grafting to= The grafting to method involves the use of a backbone chain with functional groups A that are distributed randomly along the chain.Hadjichristidis, N., S. Pispas, H. Iatrou, and D. J. Lohse. \\"Graft Copolymers.\\" Graft Copolymers. John Wiley and Sons Inc, 15 July 2002. Web. 14 Feb. 2014. The formation of the graft copolymer originates from the coupling reaction between the functional backbone and the end-groups of the branches that are reactive. These coupling reactions are made possible by modifying the backbone chemically. Common reaction mechanisms used to synthesize these copolymers include free-radical polymerization, anionic polymerization, atom-transfer radical-polymerization, and living polymerization techniques. Copolymers that are prepared with the grafting-to method often utilize anionic polymerization techniques. This method uses a coupling reaction of the electrophilic groups of the backbone polymer and the propagation site of an anionic living polymer. This method would not be possible without the generation of a backbone polymer that has reactive groups. This method has become more popular with the rise of click chemistry. A high yield chemical reaction called atom transfer nitroxide radical coupling chemistry is for the grafting-to method for polymerization. =Grafting from= In the grafting-from method, the macromolecular backbone is chemically modified in order to introduce active sites capable of initiating functionality. The initiating sites can be incorporated by copolymerization, can be incorporated in a post-polymerization reaction, or can already be a part of the polymer. If the number of active sites along the backbone participates in the formation of one branch, then the number of chains grafted to the macromolecule can be controlled by the number of active sites. Even though the number of grafted chains can be controlled, there may be a difference in the lengths of each grafted chain due to kinetic and steric hindrance effects. Grafting from reactions have been conducted from polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, and polyisobutylene. Different techniques such as anionic grafting, cationic grafting, atom-transfer radical polymerization, and free-radical polymerization have been used in the synthesis of grafting from copolymers. Graft copolymers that are employed with the grafting-from method are often synthesized with ATRP reactions and anionic and cationic grafting techniques. =Grafting through= The grafting through, also known as the macromonomer method, is one of the simpler ways of synthesizing a graft polymer with well defined side chains. Typically a monomer of a lower molecular weight is copolymerized with free radicals with an acrylate functionalized macromonomer. The ratio of monomer to macromonomer molar concentrations as well as their copolymerization behavior determines the number of chains that are grafted. As the reaction proceeds, the concentrations of monomer to macromonomer change causing random placement of branches and formation of graft copolymers with different number of branches. This method allows for branches to be added heterogeneously or homogeneously based on the reactivity ratio of the terminal functional group on the macromolecular to the monomer. The difference in distribution of grafts has significant effects on the physical properties of the grafted copolymer. Polyethylene, polysiloxanes and poly(ethylene oxide) are all macromonomers that have been incorporated in a polystyrene or poly(methyl acrylate) backbone. The macromonomer (grafting through) method can be employed using any known polymerization technique. Living polymerizations give special control over the molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and chain-end functionalization. Applications Graft copolymers became widely studied due to their increased number of applications like in drug delivery vehicles, surfactants, water filtration, rheology modifiers, etc. It is their unique structures relative to other copolymers such as alternating, periodic, statistical, and block copolymers. Some common applications of graft copolymers include: *Membranes for the separation of gases or liquids *Hydrogels *Drug deliverers *Thermoplastic elastomers *Compatibilizers for polymer blends *Polymeric emulsifiers *Impact resistant plastics High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS) consists of the polystyrene backbone with polybutadiene chains branching from it in each direction. =High impact polystyrene= CD case made from general purpose polystyrene (GPPS) and high impact polystyrene in the black portion (HIPS) High impact polystyrene (HIPS) was discovered by Charles F. Fryling in 1961. HIPS is a low cost, plastic material that is easy to fabricate and often used for low strength structural applications when impact resistance, machinability, and low cost are required. Its major applications include machined prototypes, low-strength structural components, housings, and covers. In order to produce the graft polymer, polybutadiene (rubber) or any similar elastomeric polymer is dissolved in styrene and polymerized. This reaction allows for two simultaneous polymerizations, that of styrene to polystyrene and that of the graft polymerization of styrene- rubber. During commercial use, it can be prepared by graft copolymerization with additional polymer to give the product specific characteristics. The advantages of HIPS includes: *FDA compliant *Good impact resistance *Excellent machinability *Good dimensional stability *Easy to paint and glue *Low cost *Excellent aesthetic qualities =New properties as a result of grafting= By grafting polymers onto polymer backbones, the final grafted copolymers gain new properties from their parent polymers. Specifically, cellulose graft copolymers have various different applications that are dependent on the structure of the polymer grafted onto the cellulose. Some of the new properties that cellulose gains from different monomers grafted onto it include: *Absorption of water *Improved elasticity *Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic character *Ion-exchange *Dye adsorption capabilities *Heat Resistance *Thermosensitivity *pH sensitivity *Antibacterial effect These properties give new application to the ungrafted cellulose polymers that include: *Medical body fluid absorbent materials *Enhanced moisture absorbing ability in fabrics *Permselective membranes *Stronger nucleating properties than ungrafted cellulose, and adsorption of hazardous contaminants like heavy metal ions or dyes from aqueous solutions by temperature swing adsorption *Sensors and optical materials *Reducing agents for various carbonyl compounds References Category:Polymers ","title":"Graft polymer"},{"id":"42201927","text":"The Barn is a comic created by Canadian cartoonist Ralph Hagen and syndicated by Creators Syndicate starting in October, 2008. While the strip has a number of characters, the humor of the strip is based on the daily adventures, mishaps, and/or dialogue between a curious sheep named Rory and a sarcastic bull named Stan. Storylines mimic the everyday experiences of their human captors. The setting is a farm yard next door to a veterinary clinic, where Stan and Rory usually spend time with the owner and vet, Brenda. After 25 years working in the Chevron oilfields of Alberta, Hagen took an early retirement in 2004 and decided to work as a cartoonist full-time. While developing potential strips for syndication he worked as a freelance artist selling to clients, newspapers, and magazines such as Readers Digest, Saturday Evening Post and Woman's World. Hagen turned in multiple strips to syndicates hoping for a contract with no success. Hagen then come up with two concepts: one Hagen drew rough drafts of a strip that involved farm animals, with a bull and sheep as the main characters; the other Hagen created was about animals in a vet clinic. The creators then suggested to combine the two ideas. Hagen turned in 20 rough drafts to Creators Syndicate and within weeks got a contract. After 6 months of preparation and revision, the strip was released in October, 2008. Hagen first brainstorms ideas on a scratch piece of paper then transfers the ideas to a finished copy on white copy paper; inking with a Sakura 08 micron pen. Next the drawing is scanned in Adobe Photoshop, the frames and lettering are added as well. The artwork is then sent to Vertis Communication in Buffalo, New York for coloring (Hagen colors the Sunday weekly himself). Vertis then sends the artwork to Creators Syndicate in Los Angeles where it is checked for spelling and punctuation errors before sending the final product to subscribed papers.
