Both Speed Busters: American Highways (also known as just Speed Busters) and Speed Devils are racing games in which the courses feature hazards such as dinosaurs rolling boulders, and UFOs in exotic locales including Louisiana, Louisiana Tornado, New York City, New York City Winter, Mexico, Nevada, Aspen Summer, Aspen Winter, Canada (Supposedly northern Quebec), Canada Light Winter, Canada Heavy Winter, Montreal Industrial, Hollywood, and Hollywood Disaster. The console version's career mode allowed a player to rise a racer through the ranks of a fictional racing league. Colorful rivals would challenge you to accomplish certain feats during races, making accompanying bets using prize money from competition. Money earned from gambling and performance is used to buy cars, upgrade them, and maintain them. The game also supports five players on one Dreamcast console.  Speed Devils Online Racing  Sega released Speed Devils Online Racing (also known as just Speed Devils Online), an updated version of the game in 2000 for Dreamcast that added online play. Reception Speed Busters: American Highways and Speed Devils received fairly positive reviews. GameRankings gave it a score of 79% for the PC version, 78% for the Dreamcast version, and 65% for the Mobile version. Game Revolution wrote a review on the Dreamcast version, saying, \\"At the finish line, Speed Devils is an above average racer, but not much more.\\" The reviewer said the game had good graphics and cool cars, but suffered from poorly made tracks that leave the player wondering how they managed to drive off a cliff without noticing the cliff in front of them. The article also criticized the game's two player mode for being boring and drawn out. Chris Charla reviewed the Dreamcast version of Speed Devils for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Simply put, it's the best racing game you can find on Dreamcast today\\" =Speed Devils Online Racing= Speed Devils Online Racing received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

The semantics of vary between operating systems. As an example, Unix command uses this system call to retrieve information on files that includes: * atime: time of last access () * mtime: time of last modification () * ctime: time of last status change () \`stat\` appeared in Version 1 Unix. It is among the few original Unix system calls to change, with Version 4's addition of group permissions and larger file size. stat() functions The C POSIX library header , found on POSIX and other Unix-like operating systems, declares the \`stat()\` functions, as well as related function called \`fstat()\` and \`lstat()\`. The functions take a \`struct stat\` buffer argument, which is used to return the file attributes. On success, the functions return zero, and on error, ‚àí1 is returned and errno is set appropriately. The \`stat()\` and \`lstat()\` functions take a filename argument. If the file is a symbolic link, \`stat()\` returns attributes of the eventual target of the link, while \`lstat()\` returns attributes of the link itself. The \`fstat()\` function takes a file descriptor argument instead, and returns attributes of the file that it identifies. The family of functions was extended to implement large file support. Functions named \`stat64()\`, \`lstat64()\` and \`fstat64()\` return attributes in a \`struct stat64\` structure, which represents file sizes with a 64-bit type, allowing the functions to work on files 2 GiB and larger (up to 8 EiB). When the \`_FILE_OFFSET_BITS\` macro is defined to 64, these 64-bit functions are available under the original names. The functions are defined as: int stat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf); int lstat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf); int fstat(int filedesc, struct stat *buf); stat structure This structure is defined in header file as follows, although implementations are free to define additional fields: struct stat { mode_t st_mode; ino_t st_ino; dev_t st_dev; dev_t st_rdev; nlink_t st_nlink; uid_t st_uid; gid_t st_gid; off_t st_size; struct timespec st_atim; struct timespec st_mtim; struct timespec st_ctim; blksize_t st_blksize; blkcnt_t st_blocks; }; POSIX.1 does not require \`st_rdev\`, \`st_blocks\` and \`st_blksize\` members; these fields are defined as part of XSI option in the Single Unix Specification. In older versions of POSIX.1 standard, the time- related fields were defined as \`st_atime\`, \`st_mtime\` and \`st_ctime\`, and were of type \`time_t\`. Since the 2008 version of the standard, these fields were renamed to \`st_atim\`, \`st_mtim\` and \`st_ctim\`, respectively, of type struct \`timespec\`, since this structure provides a higher resolution time unit. For the sake of compatibility, implementations can define the old names in terms of the \`tv_sec\` member of \`struct timespec\`. For example, \`st_atime\` can be defined as \`st_atim.tv_sec\`. The \`struct stat\` structure includes at least the following members: * \`st_dev\` identifier of device containing file * \`st_ino\` inode number * \`st_mode\` protection mode; see also Unix permissions * \`st_nlink\` reference count of hard links * \`st_uid\` user identifier of owner * \`st_gid\` group identifier of owner * \`st_rdev\` device identifier (if special file) * \`st_size\` total file size, in bytes * \`st_atime\` time of last access * \`st_mtime\` time of last modification * \`st_ctime\` time of last status change * \`st_blksize\` preferred block size for file system I/O, which can depend upon both the system and the type of file system * \`st_blocks\` number of blocks allocated in multiples of \`DEV_BSIZE\` (usually 512 bytes). The \`st_mode\` field is a bit field. It combines the file access modes and also indicates any special file type. There are many macros to work with the different mode flags and file types.  Criticism of atime  Reading a file changes its eventually requiring a disk write, which has been criticized as it is inconsistent with a read only file system. File system cache may significantly reduce this activity to one disk write per cache flush. Linux kernel developer Ingo Moln√°r publicly criticized the concept and performance impact of atime in 2007,Kernel Trap: Linux: Replacing atime With relatime, by Jeremy, August 7, 2007Once upon atime, LWN, by Jonathan Corbet, August 8, 2007 and in 2009, the mount option had become the default, which addresses this criticism.Linux kernel 2.6.30, Linux Kernel Newbies The behavior behind the mount option offers sufficient performance for most purposes and should not break any significant applications, as it has been extensively discussed.That massive filesystem thread, LWN, by Jonathan Corbet, March 31, 2009 Initially, only updated atime if atime < mtime or atime < ctime; that was subsequently modified to update atimes that were 24 hours old or older, so that and Debian's popularity counter (popcon) would behave properly.Relatime Recap, Valerie Aurora Current versions of the Linux kernel support four mount options, which can be specified in fstab: * (formerly , and formerly the default; as of 2.6.30) always update atime, which conforms to the behavior defined by POSIX * (\\"relative atime\\", introduced in 2.6.20 and the default as of 2.6.30) only update atime under certain circumstances: if the previous atime is older than the mtime or ctime, or the previous atime is over 24 hours in the past * never update atime of directories, but do update atime of other files * never update atime of any file or directory; implies ; highest performance, but least compatible * update atime according to specific circumstances laid out below Current versions of Linux, macOS, Solaris, FreeBSD, and NetBSD support a mount option in /etc/fstab, which causes the atime field never to be updated. Turning off atime updating breaks POSIX compliance, and some applications, such as mbox-driven \\"new mail\\" notifications,http://www.mail-archive.com/mutt- users@mutt.org/msg24912.html \\"the shell's $MAIL monitor ... depends on atime, pronouncing new email with atime($MAIL) < mtime($MAIL)\\" and some file usage watching utilities, notably tmpwatch. The option on OpenBSD behaves more like Linux . Version 4.0 of the Linux kernel mainline, which was released on April 12, 2015, introduced the new mount option . It allows POSIX-style atime updates to be performed in-memory and flushed to disk together with some non- time-related I/O operations on the same file; atime updates are also flushed to disk when some of the sync system calls are executed, or before the file's in-memory inode is evicted from the filesystem cache. Additionally, it is possible to configure for how long atime modifications can remain unflushed. That way, lazytime retains POSIX compatibility while offering performance improvements.  ctime  It is tempting to believe that originally meant creation time;https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/cacm.html however, while early Unix did have modification and creation times, the latter was changed to be access time before there was any C structure in which to call anything . The file systems retained just the access time () and modification time () through 6th edition Unix. The timestamp was added in the file system restructuring that occurred with 7th edition Unix, and has always referred to inode change time. It is updated any time file metadata stored in the inode changes, such as file permissions, file ownership, and creation and deletion of hard links. In some implementations, is affected by renaming a file: Both original Unix, which implemented a renaming by making a link (updating ) and then unlinking the old name (updating again) and modern Linux tend to do this. Unlike and , cannot be set to an arbitrary value with , as used by the utility, for example. Instead, when is used, or for any other change to the inode other than an update to caused by accessing the file, the value is set to the current time.  Time granularity  * provides times accurate to one second. * Some filesystems provide finer granularity. Solaris 2.1 introduced a microsecond resolution with UFS in 1992 and a nanosecond resolution with ZFS. * In Linux kernels 2.5.48 and above, the stat structure supports nanosecond resolution for the three file timestamp fields. These are exposed as additional fields in the stat structure. * The resolution of create time on FAT filesystem is 10 milliseconds, while resolution of its write time is two seconds, and access time has a resolution of one day thus it acts as the access date.MSDN: File Times  Example  #include #include #include #include #include #include #include int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { struct stat sb; struct passwd *pwuser; struct group *grpnam; if (argc < 2) { fprintf(stderr, \\"Usage: %s: file ... \\", argv[0]); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) { if (-1  stat(argv[i], &sb;)) { perror(\\"stat()\\"); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } if (NULL  (pwuser = getpwuid(sb.st_uid))) { perror(\\"getpwuid()\\"); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } if (NULL  (grpnam = getgrgid(sb.st_gid))) { perror(\\"getgrgid()\\"); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } printf(\\"%s: \\", argv[i]); printf(\\"\\\\tinode: %u \\", sb.st_ino); printf(\\"\\\\towner: %u (%s) \\", sb.st_uid, pwuser->pw_name); printf(\\"\\\\tgroup: %u (%s) \\", sb.st_gid, grpnam->gr_name); printf(\\"\\\\tperms: %o \\", sb.st_mode & (S_IRWXU  S_IRWXG  S_IRWXO)); printf(\\"\\\\tlinks: %d \\", sb.st_nlink); printf(\\"\\\\tsize: %ld \\", sb.st_size); /* you may use %lld */ printf(\\"\\\\tatime: %s\\", ctime(&sb.st;_atim.tv_sec)); printf(\\"\\\\tmtime: %s\\", ctime(&sb.st;_mtim.tv_sec)); printf(\\"\\\\tctime: %s\\", ctime(&sb.st;_ctim.tv_sec)); printf(\\" \\"); } return 0; } References * IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004, documentation for fstat(2).

Jakobsberg, J√§rf√§lla's commercial and administrative centre, grew up around the railway. In the 1940s, blocks of flats were built and the municipal council moved its offices here. Jakobsberg gradually became the centre of the municipality and now has a population of 24,046. The Jakobsberg Centre includes shops, offices, car parks and apartments, as well as a modern library, an art gallery, an exhibition hall and a cinema. There are a number of ancient monuments and buildings of historic interest in the area. Jakobsbergs G√•rd - a 17th-century manor-house - is now a community based centre that hosts a variety of events such as weddings, business meetings, parties etc., organized by public and private organizations and people. However, it is not located in the municipality of Jakobsberg, but rather in a southern suburb of Stockholm known as Bred√§ng, which is about 30 kilometers south of the location being discussed in this article. S√§by G√•rd, from the 1650s, houses a Steiner Waldorf nursery school and a riding school. G√∂rv√§ln House on the shore of Lake M√§laren was built in the 1660s.

The town is situated close to Stockholm's main international airport, Arlanda. Even if its origins go back to around 500 AD, M√§rsta is a widespread modern residential area. M√§rsta has a mix of multi-storey dwellings and smaller houses. It is in a phase of expansion and new residential areas are built both in central parts of M√§rsta and in the surrounding areas like for instance Steningeh√∂jden. M√§rsta can be reached by Stockholm commuter rail trains running at quarterly intervals during daytime and by bus from Stockholm Arlanda Airport. The central parts of M√§rsta has a shopping area \\"M√§rsta Centrum\\" with various shops, pub and restaurants. Another smaller shopping area is \\"Valsta Centrum\\". East of the central parts of M√§rsta there is an industrial area and a bit further east close to the airport a shopping mall \\"Eurostop\\". Most parts of M√§rsta and the municipality of Sigtuna can be reached with local bus services originating at the railway station and also connecting with commuter trains. Name The origin of the name M√§rsta goes back to around 500 AD. At that time most of the valleys in M√§rsta were still under water, which explains the name. M√§r- is found in the Swedish word \\"mj√§rde\\" which is a fishing tool, and -sta means a place (area or somekind of habitat) like the Swedish word \\"stad\\" meaning city. M√§rsta means \\"place to fish\\" or \\"fishing-place\\". Geography M√§rsta is situated north of Steningevik, which is a bay of the lake M√§laren. The center of the town is located in a valley called M√§rstadal and the area S√§tuna, which also holds the train station of the town. The rest of the town's buildings spread upon and below the hills that form the valleys in M√§rsta. The stream that flows through the town out to Steningevik is called M√§rsta√•n. It is also located along the motorway E4 about 37 km north of central Stockholm, 33 km south of Uppsala and about 4 km from Arlanda Airport. Coat of arms The coat of arms of M√§rsta resulted from merging the seals of the two hundreds of √Ñrlinghundra and Seminghundra, which are today located in M√§rsta. The combined seal, showing a key and axe crossed in gold on a blood-red ground, is known to have been in use from 1568. The key was the symbol of √Ñrlinghundra and symbolised \\"the key to heaven's gates\\". The axe was the symbol of Seminghundra and symbolized the axe which killed Saint Olaf; Seminghundra was also known as an execution place for convicts during the Middle Ages. M√§rsta existed as a municipality of its own between 1952 and 1970. The coat of arms was created in 1954 and became obsolete as municipal arms when M√§rsta was merged into Sigtuna Municipality in 1971. High rise at M√§rsta Railway Station Arkaden in M√§rsta City housing restaurants, offices and a gym History The area has been populated since the Stone Age and due to the location of traditional Viking-land has rich archaeological remains from the Bronze Age, Iron Age and Viking Age. There are many runestones and older ruins of stone castles and walls in the M√§rsta area. The area of today's modern M√§rsta consisted of big farms and small communities, that were (and still are) typical for the landscape of the province Uppland. M√§rsta was just one of these farms but due to the location and importance of travelling between Stockholm and Uppsala, the farm had to turn into an inn. The important travelling road can be traced back to the Viking Age and even older ages. During the days of the Swedish Empire many of the old nobles became land owners in the area and built palaces like Steninge, Sk√•nelaholm, Rosersberg and Venngarn. Even Sweden's oldest public school is located in Husby-√Ñrlinghundra, the parish of M√§rsta. It was built in 1697 and is today a museum. The first telegraph pole in Sweden was placed in M√§rsta 1853 and the train station got built in the 1860s. It is currently the northern termini of the commuter railways in Stockholm, and a minor interchange to SJ. The name M√§rsta got along only because it was common for travellers even though they were placed on neighbouring farms. The M√§rsta municipality was formed in 1952 due to a fusion of the parishes of Husby- √Ñrlinghundra, Norrsunda, Odensala and Sk√•nela. In 1967 the parishes of Vidbo, Lunda and Skepptuna also merged into the municipality. In 1971 the cities of Sigtuna and M√§rsta were forged together and formed Sigtuna Municipality with M√§rsta as the seat of the ruling council. In 1957 the Swedish government decided to build Stockholm's new international airport, Stockholm Arlanda, at Halmsj√∂n, east of M√§rsta. In its decision the government mentioned the building of a town where the employees at the new airport could live. The town was located IN M√§rsta. A plan for the residential area was made in 1960 and during the 1960s the population of M√§rsta quadrupled. A large part of the buildings in M√§rsta was built in the 1960s. Expansion of M√§rsta to the east is restricted due to the 55 dB(A) noise area restrictions in force. There are not many older houses in the central parts of M√§rsta but south of M√§rsta, Steninge Castle is located, with an environment dating back to 1690. Steninge Castle is a popular tourist attraction. Culture and education There is a private cinema, \\"Biok√§llan i Forum\\" in M√§rsta. There is a public theatre facility, Sigtuna Municipal Theatre, \\"Kulturum\\" which is M√§rstas venue for theater, concerts and conferences. The theater was completed in autumn 1980 and was inaugurated in November of that year. The salon has 454 seats. Local productions, performances and conferences are held at \\"Kulturum\\". The theater is used for many different purposes, such as local productions, performances, arts school concerts, conferences and more. Once a month the City Council uses the Sigtuna Municipal Theatre as meeting room. Kulturum is in the same building as M√§rstas gymnasium, (Arlandagymnasiet). Like many similar sized Swedish towns and central communities M√§rsta has pre school and pedagogical care facilities available to its citizens and also high schools and a gymnasium, (Arlandagymnasiet). M√§rsta also has a school for adult education. There is a public library in the town centre, (M√§rsta Centrum). Business and employment There are some local businesses in M√§rsta and also two major factories producing paint, Beckers Industrial Coatings AB,http://www.becker.se/ producing industrial paint, and Becker Acroma, now part of Sherwin-Williams. There are also some transport and spedition companies in the area. But most employment opportunities for people living in M√§rsta are at Stockholm Arlanda Airport and in Stockholm City.

According to the census of 2000 6,003 people lived in Skutsk√§r, most of them in √Ñlvkarleby Municipality, but a minor part in G√§vle Municipality in G√§vleborg County. History Originally Skutsk√§r was the area south and south-east from the industries located there. The first record of Skutsk√§r (Ship Reef) is done 1741 and describes an anchoring point for the industries of Harn√§s. The industries in question are iron smelting furnaces in Harn√§s (shut down in the 1910s) and later the saw mill and wood pulp mill Skutsk√§rsverken owned by Stora Enso which is still one of the largest in the world. This mill and its subcontractors remains by far the largest employer in Skutsk√§r and the surrounding area. Skutsk√§r back then had a large percentage of laborers and their families, which led to the building of all the facilities needed in a small town, including schools, shops, a fire brigade, ambulance and police. Even a public bath (shut down and demolished in the 1970s) and other facilities that must have been a luxury for the working class was built, often with support from the pulp mill. The other half of what is now Skutsk√§r is still called Upplandsbodarna or just Bodarna, especially by the older generations. It is located further south, along the Boda river, which is a small branch of the Dal√§lven river, before they both flow into the sea. The population consisted mainly of farmers and fishermen. This village was present a long time before the industries of Skutsk√§r and associated to the √Ñlvkarleby population. Skutsk√§r and Bodarna was not physically the same town until the 1930s, when the new housing district of Kyrkbyn was built. By then the combination of the two urban areas was known simply as Skutsk√§r. Skutsk√§r now remains a stable community population-wise due to the wood pulp mill, the saw mill (that is now run by other ventures after Stora shut down its saw mill operations in Skutsk√§r), and the vicinity to G√§vle but the municipality is struggling with its financial situation due to political decisions in the 1980s and 90s, mainly integration problems and failed building projects.

At this time there were five lakes, which today are formed into one single lake. The lake shore is one of the places where many ancient remains have been found. It is speculated that when people learned to farm, this population moved out of the region to an area better for farming. The next known human settlement was during the Middle Ages, and this is also when the first R√•da Church was built. During the Middle Ages, the border with Denmark went through what is today M√∂lnlycke and therefore the area was much affected by war between Denmark and Sweden. The first time the name M√∂lnlycke was mentioned that we know of was 1576. The name was originally made up of the two Old Swedish words ‚Äúm√∂lna‚Äù and ‚Äúlycka‚Äù, literally meaning mill field. It probably came from a mill built at the location of today's M√∂lnlycke Fabriker during the Middle Ages. In 1849, Gustaf Ferdinand Hennig founded M√∂lnlycke V√§fveri AB, a textile manufacturer, which has had a big impact on M√∂lnlycke. In addition to attracting many workers to the city, it also led to the building of the railway between Gothenburg and Bor√•s, which today still has a stop in M√∂lnlycke. Today the company is called M√∂lnlycke Health Care.  Geography  M√∂lnlycke is located at a height of 91 meters above sea level and is about 10 km from Gothenburg, the second largest city in Sweden. The short distance to Gothenburg is probably one of the factors of the quick expansion of the city that started during the 20th century, when many people started commuting between M√∂lnlycke and Gothenburg.  Culture  M√∂lnlycke Kulturhus, located in the center of M√∂lnlycke, contains M√∂lnlycke library, a cinema and a caf√©.

The current President and CEO of Zoo Atlanta is Raymond B. King. History The gorilla exhibit Zoo Atlanta was founded in 1889, when businessman George V. Gress purchased a bankrupt traveling circus and donated the animals to the city of Atlanta. City leaders opted to house the collection in Grant Park, which remains the zoo's present location. Original residents of the zoo included a black bear, a raccoon, a jaguar, a hyena, a gazelle, a Mexican hog, lionesses, monkeys, and camels. The zoo's collection expanded in the 1930s with the personal donation of a private menagerie owned by Asa G. Candler, Jr. The 1950s and 1960s were decades of renovation and construction at the zoo, but by the early 1970s, many of its exhibits and facilities were outdated and showing signs of disrepair. In 1970, a small group of concerned citizens founded the Atlanta Zoological Society in hopes of raising funds and awareness for the institution. Following a period of decline in the mid-1980s, the zoo was privatized in 1985 with the creation of a nonprofit organization, Atlanta Fulton-County Zoo Inc., and was renamed Zoo Atlanta that same year. A 20-year period of aggressive restoration followed, marked by several high-profile exhibit openings, including The Ford African Rain Forest, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A pair of giant pandas, Lun Lun and Yang Yang, made their debut at Zoo Atlanta in 1999.Pandas Make Themselves at Home in Atlanta Zoo Habitats =The Ford African Rain Forest= Families often pose with one of the Willie B. bronze statues at Zoo Atlanta.

The zoo is also home to six of Willie B.'s grandchildren: Macy B (2005) and Merry Leigh (2011) and Mijadala (2016), born to Kudzoo; Gunther (2006) and Anaka (2013), born to Sukari; Andi (2013), born to Lulu. The Living Treehouse is an extension of The Ford African Rain Forest completed in 2004. The exhibit houses an aviary of African birds, as well as black-and-white ruffed lemurs and ring-tailed lemurs, with adjacent habitats for Angolan colobus monkeys, drills, Schmidt's guenons, and Wolf's guenons. In 2017, Zoo Atlanta introduced two crowned lemurs. =Trader's Alley and Complex Carnivores= Opened in 2010, Trader's Alley: Wildlife's Fading Footprints is focused on species impacted by the international wildlife trade.

A rare Guatemalan beaded lizard hatched at Zoo Atlanta in March 2012. The World of Reptiles was the zoo's oldest public building used for public exhibits, designed in the late 1950s and opened to the public in 1962. The building was home to hundreds of snakes, lizards, turtles, tortoises, frogs, toads, and salamanders from around the world.

Elemental Gimmick Gear uses hand-drawn art in an overhead view during exploration, then switches to 3D graphics during boss battles. It was developed by Birthday and published by Hudson Soft in Japan and Vatical Entertainment in the United States. Gameplay The game follows through several ruins, that contain puzzles needing to be solved to move forward. Puzzles include switches and moving objects to open doors. There are racing areas where the main character rolls into a ball (or egg shape) and race along rails to be the first to finish against the computer players. Plot =Beginning= In the world of Tokion, a dome-shaped ancient ruin was discovered inside a thick jungle. During excavation, an egg-shaped robot was found inside the ruins containing a sleeping man. No matter how hard scientists tried, he would not wake up. He was taken to a laboratory along with the machine to be further studied. Upon analyzing the machine, they learned that it was over 5000 years old. They also could not find any form of power source. In time, the machine became known as \\"Elemental Gimmick Gear\\", or EGG for short. After extensive scientific analysis over a number of years, copies of the EGG were produced and used as personal robots. 100 years later, the ruin suddenly became active after a group of robots activated a button, which unleashed the power of a scary holographic face called Psycho Mother. These robots were later revealed to be members of a gang called The Pirates. This incident was later dubbed by the Tokionese as \\"The Breeding\\", as the power of Psycho Mother created a multitude of tentacles into the ground. They spread all across the land, destroying anything in their way and spawning a horde of killer monsters and robots in the process. With the tentacles came a thick layer of fog that surrounded the ruin, and people gave them the name Fogna. At the same time, the Sleeper who was discovered a century prior finally awoke. He had not aged a day since his discovery and had no memory of his past or his own name. Selen, who was with him as he woke, set him free without notifying the other scientists in the lab. Naming him at default as Logan, she sent him to Fogna to begin searching for clues of what happened 5100 years ago, and to stop \\"The Breeding\\". Because Logan spends most of his time inside his EGG robot, many players have referred to the protagonist simply as \\"EGG\\" (said letter-by-letter).Elemental Gimmick Gear game manual. p. 2-3 =Middle= While making his way through the first areas of Fogna, battling brain robots and a spider named Jointer (earning a Fire Stone), EGG returns to the village to hear that Selen was kidnapped by The Pirates. The Pirates are a vicious gang of robots led by Juji, the brutal dictator of Tokion that has long oppressed its people. Upon talking to many of the townspeople (being asleep for 5100 years, EGG is unfamiliar with where he lives), he learns that Juji resides in Metal Heaven, a steampunk sky village that is rumoured to be \\"a paradise\\". The only way to get there is to succeed a series of life-threatening trials at Fog Tower, which connects Metal Heaven to Tokion. This tower serves as a buffer zone to prevent ordinary people from entering Metal Heaven, by which only Juji's bravest Pirates are able to pass the challenges. EGG uses the Fire Stone that he found from defeating Jointer to break the branches that block his way to Fog Tower, saving a woman stuck behind the branches. However, he then learns that he needs the Ice Stone as well to freeze the ponds that guard Fog Tower. He finds that stone after exploring Fogna's back entrance, where he encounters The Pirates face-to-face for the first time. EGG uses the Ice Stone to access Fog tower, and completes all of the puzzles and challenges successfully. In the last challenge of Fog Tower, EGG was forced to fight Maximum, Juji's right-hand man. After EGG severely damaged Maximum (despite being alive still), Juji ordered two of his Pirates to throw him off the tower, as Juji felt that Maximum was \\"a weakling\\" upon his loss in the battle. Juji offers EGG to be his new right-hand man, and tells him to go to The Factory to meet up with him. Although EGG knows that his goal is to find Selen, and that Juji is an enemy, EGG agrees so he can get access to The Factory. On the top floor of The Factory, EGG is able to find Selen, and he proceeds to find Juji in the next room. Although Juji treats him in a friendly manner, EGG shows him his true feelings, wanting payback for kidnapping Selen. Angered and betrayed, Juji gets inside of a large robots, and a boss fight ensures. Upon destroying the robot and capturing Juji, EGG is awarded $1000 by the village mayor, a knight named Henry. Rots, the owner of the Eastokion Bar, is furious at Juji for an unexplained grudge that they have against each other. If EGG apologizes to Juji after Rots leaves in anger, he will begin to talk to EGG in a friendlier manner (despite being angry for what happened at The Factory) This decision made by the player will help to reveal a major plot point not found anywhere else in the game. Selen, back at the laboratory, awards EGG a propellor, which he can use to explore the flooded basement of Fogna. There, he needs to locate a green Plasma Stone to activate the elevator at Fogna's main entrance. The elevator takes EGG to Fogna's second floor, which has a long tentacle bridge at the second floors exit. This bridge takes him to a place called Trench Plant, an underwater base where EGG's (unknowingly) long lost friend, Omega, resides. This is around the point when EGG begins to remember who he was and his past. EGG is only familiar to Omega from three prior, yet vague, flashbacks: ::: 1st (before encountering The Pirates at Fogna)- Omega and EGG (as Dr. Beta) are in a rocky environment on a different planet (judging by the rocky textures), discussing organism samples that died off. They agree that they need to find more samples. ::: 2nd (when entering Metal Heaven)- Omega and EGG are standing in front of a large war robot called Armordress. They discuss how they built it, and that they are afraid ‚Äúfor the time when it must be used‚Äù. They fear that the machine could ‚Äúextinct humanity‚Äù. ::: 3rd (at the tentacle bridge)- An earthquake occurs, and EGG becomes trapped underneath rocks. EGG was left there for 5,000 years until the excavation at the beginning of the game. After having a lengthy discussion with Omega about their shared past, EGG is clarified about who he was. EGG was originally a scientist named Dr. Beta, who helped to construct a colony on the moon (Moon Colony). He was also an important researcher there. It was constructed during the time of World War 3, where the world became so ravaged and destroyed, that people lived at the colony until it was safe enough to return to Earth. The Armordress from the second flashback was what made World War 3 deadlier than it should have been. Fogna served as a ‚Äúgateway‚Äù between Earth and Moon Colony. Omega states that Psycho Mother was originally programmed by a scientist named Alpha. Because he isn't mentioned anywhere else in the game, this character was most likely to be used for a future sequel, which never came to be. Omega orders EGG to go to Moon Colony, using the spaceship at Fog Tower to get there. However, while riding the ship, Psycho Mother learns of EGG's and Omega's actions. Omega is killed, and EGG dodges a tentacle launched at him. At Moon Colony, all of the previous robots that were stationed there have gone haywire, due to the powers of Psycho Mother. There, EGG finds Moon Colony's main computer, Grand Mother. She orders EGG to find the Nova Stone, which can unlock the 16th basement of Fogna where Psycho Mother lives. She wants Psycho Mother to be defeated once and for all. =End= EGG finds the Nova Stone from Moon Colony, and returns to Tokion back on Earth. If EGG speaks with Juji at the village square before pursuing Psycho mother one-on-one, the player will have to make two very important choices. If the player selects EGG to say \\"I refuse (the money)\\" and \\"No, I feel sorry for you\\", EGG will learn things of Juji's past. During the conversation, Juji begins to speak in a sad and more human tone, compared to his personality as a brutal dictator. He even speaks pleasantly about a child who offered him bread. EGG can then go to meet Rots at the Easttokion Bar. After Rots asks EGG how Juji is doing, the player should select \\"He was thinking\\". Rots then leaves to meet Juji. However, once EGG goes back to the village square, Juji is nowhere to be found, and Rots explains to him their grudge (which was before unexplained): ::: Rots and Juji were best friends, and both worked as archaeologists. Juji had a 5-year-old son named Timmy, who would follow them on their excavations. When they went inside Fogna to find something (years before \\"The Breeding\\" took place), an earthquake happened, and Timmy became trapped under rocks. Rots and Juji quickly run out of Fogna to check to see if we were safe. Unfortunately, Juji struggled to get Timmy out of the rocks, so Rots went around town to get help. However, no one was willing to help, and Timmy died in front of Juji's eyes as a result. ::: Once Juji became Tokion's dictator, he would purge its people out of revenge of neglecting his son. To ensure the last step of the people's destruction, Juji ordered his Pirates to go to the bottom of Fogna, to find \\"Fogna's ultimate power\\" (he is referring to what was later discovered to be Psycho Mother). This was the exact moment that created \\"The Breeding\\", and all of the tentacles that destroyed Tokion. ::: Rots then told EGG that Juji stole a man's robot to stop \\"The Breeding\\" and Psycho Mother himself, trying to correct his past wrongdoing of unleashing her power. Once EGG reaches the last room of Fogna's 16th basement, EGG confronts Psycho Mother. She is in an extremely mad state, appearing more vicious and scary than before. Before shutting down permanently, Psycho Mother uses the last of her energy to hatch the large snowglobe egg found in the center of Fogna. A large tube tunnel of tentacles is created from the snowglobe egg, connecting to Fogna's rooftop. There, Psycho Mother's son Noman is born. Upon taking the elevator to the snowglobe egg room, Juji is seen at the brink of death. In his last breaths, Juji tells EGG how he unsuccessfully tried to stop Psycho Mother and her forces, and that EGG is the last hope in stopping \\"The Breeding\\" that he created long ago. Juji also offers EGG an Energy Tank before dying. Without it, EGG will have a very difficult time defeating Noman. In his last words, Juji says, \\"Oh... He's calling me... Timmy, Daddy's here...\\" Confronting Noman on Fogna's roof, Noman attaches himself to a large monster to make him unstoppable. EGG successfully defeats Noman and the monster, sending him through a black hole. Upon the defeat, EGG's friends congratulate him for stopping Psycho Mother and her forces (especially for Noman). However, EGG tells them that the only way \\"The Breeding\\" can officially be ended is for him to return to Moon Colony, shutting down Fogna permanently from there. As a result, EGG cannot return to Earth to visit his friends. EGG wishes them a final farewell before leaving and permanently shuts down Fogna with the Grand Mother computer. Fogna couldn't be shut down prior to EGG's first visit with Grand Mother, as Psycho Mother's power prevented Fogna from being able to self-destruct. The game ends with an important life message: ::: \\"In the past, people made many mistakes. We still do. That may never change. However, we are also given the ability to correct mistakes and make fresh starts. As long as we do not forget that, we can rise again and again after any degree of destruction. We should be able to live along with our planet because we are also one of the lives that it has created and raised. In the future, our planet may be blessed with beautiful and perfect civilizations. Or it may be violated again. It is... up to us...\\" With reading the plotline and all its complex details, the context is obvious. This is explaining Juji's past evil and his change-of-heart in helping EGG to stop Psycho Mother (who he sent his Pirates to unleash at the beginning of the game). Characters ;Sleeper \\"The Sleeper\\", Leon is the main character of the game. Leon is his default name, he is given it by Selen, the scientist watching over him. The player has the option of renaming him if desired. At the beginning of the game, Leon is frozen in a sleeping pod in the laboratory of Dr. Yam. Leon had been found 200 years earlier inside the original EGG, in which he had slept for 5000 years. ;Dr. Yam Dr. Yam is the head doctor at YAM Ruin Laboratory, which his father founded, where Leon awakes at the start of the game. He has spent his life studying the Sleeper. He takes care of Selen as if she were his daughter and gave her the assignment of studying the Sleeper. ;Selen Selen works in the laboratory, where she is responsible for caring for the Sleeper, whom she names Leon. She is the one who was with Leon as he woke and allows him to leave the lab. She always supports him. ;Luckie Luckie is an orphan who lost his parents during the Fogna activation. He lives in the city near YAM Ruin Laboratory with his younger sister. He is the leader of the local orphans from the Fogna disaster.

Kungshamn is situated on a peninsula just north of Lysekil and on the same longitude as Uddevalla, Sk√∂vde and Link√∂ping. Since 1970, the town is connected to the Sm√∂gen island by a bridge. Kungshamn is known for its fishing industry. The Abba Seafood company is located next to Sm√∂gen Bridge. Since 1920, all products for the company have been manufactured in the town.\\"Abba Seafood: Om f√∂retaget\\"  Name  The direct translation of Kungshamn is \\"King's harbour\\" but mostly known as and correctly translated to \\"King's Landing\\". The name implies a connection to a king, but its origin is unknown. The locality was named Kungshamn in the 1960s.\\"V√§stSverige: Soten√§s Turistbyr√•\\" Before the renaming, it consisted of the smaller settlements Gravarne, B√§ckevik and Fisket√•ngen. The names referred to the small communities located in the \\"Kungshamn area\\". Gravarne was the most commonly used in the late 20th century and fishermen used that name on their boats to identify their home port.\\"Bohusgillet.se: Kungshamn\\"  History  All of Bohusl√§n used to belong to Norway until it was seceded to Sweden in the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde.\\"Bohusl√§n museum\\" During the Middle Ages, foreigners were attracted by the rich herring fishing and therefore came to the west coast of Sweden to fish herring and later export it. Toll houses were established and one of the largest was in Kungshamn. Due to the herring fishing more and more people came to settle down in the Kungshamn locality. A more permanent village was established during the 19th century, due to a period of exceptional rich herring fishing.\\" Soten√§s: Soten√§s Kommun\\"  Nature  The north eastern part of Kungshamn is forested.

It is famous for one of the most valuable postage stamps in the world, the Treskilling Yellow from 13 July 1857, Kopparberg's wooden church (voted No. 1 in Sweden in 2006), and Kopparberg Cider, now one of the best selling ciders in the UK and worldwide. This name is traditionally associated with Falun, some 90 km to the north, and gave its name to Kopparbergs l√§n (Kopparberg County, now called Dalarna County) and the 700-year-old mining company Stora Kopparberg, which is now part of Stora Enso. However, the town was founded as late as 1635 with the name Nya Kopparberget. It was named after the copper mines that were, in the 18th century, a major supply of the world's copper, and a considerable contributor to the Swedish national economy. Kopparberg lies on a major north‚Äìsouth road, 80 km north of Sweden's sixth most populous city, √ñrebro. √ñrebro is in the middle of Sweden, lying on the east‚Äìwest 500 km/300 mile E18/E20 highway and also railway lines that directly connect Stockholm, Sweden, to Oslo, Norway. These are some of the busiest in Sweden.  Population  Kopparberg has approximately 4,200 inhabitants, although its population has been steadily declining over the past 40 years. The population is ageing as the young people move away to education, jobs, and a more entertaining life in the larger cities, √ñrebro University and the Kopparberg Brewery being the major attractions for many. However people born in Kopparberg tend to return as they get older. Almost 10% of the inhabitants are immigrants. This is due to the influx of immigrants the town receives through the auspices of the Swedish Government. Politically, it has a somewhat higher concentration of those who favour the Milj√∂partiet (Environmental or Green Party) and the V√§nsterpartiet (former Communist Party).  Geography  Kopparberg lies in a mountainous mid-lower-central district of Sweden named Bergslagen, after the regional laws and customs prevailing there. Another name applied to the region is mellansverige = middle Sweden. This particular region was one of the last to be settled in Sweden. Certain varieties of plant and mushroom are only found in their particular forms in Bergslagen. Climate The Bergslagen area is comparatively cool compared to lowland areas further south in the county such as √ñrebro. Kopparberg has a cool humid continental climate due to recent mildening of the climate. In the 1961‚Äì1990 reference period the nearest weather station at nearby locality St√§lldalen indicated a maritime type of a subarctic climate. Although Kopparberg is slightly further south, it is located at a slightly higher elevation south-east, rendering likely values very similar. Winter highs usually average just below freezing, and frosts are frequent from October through April. Summers are very tempered, comparable to both the M√§lar Valley to the south and east and central Dalarna to the north. The warmest recorded temperature of is still high by Swedish standards, courtesy of the unpredictability of its far inland position.  Tourism  = Sightseeing = Among the noteworthy sights are Kopparberg's Church (voted as the nicest church in Sweden), Gillersklack (ski sports, walking, pools), Finngruvan (the copper mines), and last, but not least, the sheer beauty of nature. Nearby is Kloten, a well-established recreation and hunting area. Neighbours from the eastern side of the Baltic Sea are attracted in the summer every year by the available bountiful harvests of lingonberries, a small, ground growing version of cranberry, and by bilberries. They come and pick berries by the bucket, and either sell them in Sweden, or take them back to their native countries. = Culture and events = Kopparbergs Marknad (Fair) is held on the last weekend of September. It has been billed as the third largest annual fair in Sweden. Around 125,000 people attend this, depending on the weather. The event starts on Friday afternoon (the carnival is held on Friday evening, lasting until midnight) and the fair continues until Sunday afternoon. A wide variety of items are sold, including clothing, footwear, jewellery, electrical, cooking and household goods, DVDs, CDs, tapes, second-hand books, magazines and food, including hot, fresh corn-on- the-cob. Some live entertainment is available too. Annually, in late June or early July, the town is host to a gold panning contest. The Swedish Gold Panning Championship has been held here several times, and Kopparberg has also hosted The World Gold Panning Championship. Once per year, generally in June, a gem and mineral show, billed as the largest in Europe, is held in the northern part of the town. Opera p√• Sk√§ret is home to a cultural association, and is situated in the northwest part of the town, where it hosts concerts and events. 13 July every year is a special day, commemorating the Treskilling Yellow stamp. The stamp is one of the most valuable postage stamps in the world, and it was minted in Kopparberg on 13 July 1857.  Transportation  = Bus = Kopparberg is reachable from the north or south via the local bus company L√§nsTrafiken, based in √ñrebro (1.5 hours), and a national bus line, Swebus, from destinations throughout Sweden. = Train = Kopparberg is connected by train to √ñrebro (80 km, journey time approximately 1 hour) and Hallsberg (108 km) to the south, and Ludvika (40 km), Borl√§nge (90 km), and Falun (120 km) to the north.  Business life  The largest company in Kopparberg town is Kopparbergs Brewery, with around 150 employees. Independently owned by the Bronsman family, the brewery has gone on to produce the UK's number 1 fruit cider and the most recognisable fruit cider in the world - listed in 37 countries worldwide. Business seems to have diversified slightly over the last 10 years.  Kopparberg's economics  The first employment in the area came about because of the mines. At that time it was mining, smelting, and various general supportive enterprises which formed the basis of the town. Later metal products and manufacturing came into vogue. B. Nilsson AB's Bandst√•l (band = strip, st√•l = steel) manufacturing and sales is still in business today, situated in the business park to the south of town, called B√•ngbro (b√•ng = bang, bro = bridge), so-called because it lies south of the bridge, in an area notable for industries whose work involved repetitive banging noises. More recently, one of the town's best established and most significant employers is the Kopparbergs Brewery, owned by two brothers, which manufactures various alcoholic drinks. Kopparberg Premium Cider is one of their brands of Swedish fruit ciders, first launched in 1997, which is exported to United States of America, United Kingdom, Finland and the Republic of Ireland amongst other countries. The ciders are manufactured with an alcohol content that varies from 0 to 8.5%. Many flavours are in production, but the most widely distributed are Apple, Pear and Raspberry/Blackcurrant (although strawberry is gaining in popularity). The pear cider is sold by IKEA in a non-alcoholic version in many countries. The brewery also makes the most popular beer in Sweden, called Sofiero Original. Sofiero has been the most popular beer in Sweden since its release in 2003. More recently, a foreign company, called QXL, came to do an Internet bid-on-products until deadline auction service (eBay-type) business from Kopparberg. PC Express bought the firm and used the warehouse, but later moved the business to Sweden's capital Stockholm.  History  = Kopparberg's mines = According to current research, an ancient meteor landed approximately 14.5 million years ago to the west-northwest of the city. This area is particularly rich in certain minerals, and a most diverse variety of minerals is to be found in the region. Copper was discovered on the surface no later than 1634 on the hills that now form part of the town of Kopparberg, itself, and stretch out to the north. Word quickly spread of the richness of the copper veins. As mining, particularly in the winter, was hard and difficult, and the Finns were acclimatized to hard work under cold conditions, they readily took to mining and refining this rich source of copper. The most famous and largest mine is called Finngruvan (Fin = Finland or Finns, gruvan = the mine), which lies just outside the town, proper, to the north. The veins were almost completely pure copper, with trace amounts of silver and gold. = Kopparberg's church = In the old days, the church was the centre of all local activity on Sundays. Kopparberg's church was begun in 1635, and the first incarnation was completed shortly thereafter. The church was voted as the most beautiful church in Sweden in a voting held by the Swedish magazine √Öret Runt in February 2006. The church is named Ljusnarsbergs Kyrka after the parish Ljusnarsberg. In 1674 a residence for the clock (bells) keeper was created, called Klockarg√•rden (klock = bell, g√•rden = plot). That site serves today as the headquarters and school for KomVux, a multi-purpose educational institution for those training for new work, those out of work, and immigrants. You can notice the age of the building by how you have to stoop to go through the inner doors between rooms. People were shorter in olden days. = Ljusnarsberg architecture = Most old buildings are log cabins and tree-houses (tr√§-hus, as the Swedes call them). These are mostly protected by red stain produced from the mines of the name of Kopparberg in Falun. This stain is universal in Sweden and all the barns are painted with Falun Red, with very few exceptions. This gives the landscape a uniform effect: Grass is green and barns and houses are red. Later, many of these, not all, came to be covered with mortar, stucco, and other sidings, giving them even more cold resistance and durability. Many of these buildings from hundreds of years ago are still standing and quite functional.

It debuted on Fox on April 5, 1987 (the network's second original primetime series to air following Married... with Children) and ran until May 26, 1990. The show was produced by Gracie Films and 20th Century Fox Television. The show blended sketch comedy with musical numbers and dance routines, choreographed by Paula Abdul, along with animated shorts. The format was conceived by creator and executive producer James L. Brooks, who was looking to showcase the show's multitalented star. Brooks likened the show to producing three pilots a week. Ullman was the first British woman to be offered her own television sketch show in both the United Kingdom and the United States. The show is also known for producing a series of shorts featuring the Simpson family, which was later adapted into the longest-running American scripted primetime television series, The Simpsons. The Tracey Ullman Show garnered Fox its first ever Emmy nomination and win; it was awarded a total of eleven over its run. Rolling Stone ranked The Tracey Ullman Show as the #25 best sketch comedy show in its \\"40 Greatest Sketch-Comedy TV Shows of All Time\\" list. This was the first sketch comedy show to have a female star on Fox; the second was Party Over Here in 2015. Format A typical episode of The Tracey Ullman Show consists of two or three sketches (or playlets) featuring Tracey Ullman playing an array of characters along with her supporting cast of Julie Kavner, Dan Castellaneta, Sam McMurray, Joseph Malone ‚Äì and, in the case of season three, Anna Levine. The final sketch of the night usually includes a musical or dance number featuring Ullman either solo or with other members of the cast. Paula Abdul was responsible for choreographing all of the show's dance routines. Interstitial cartoon shorts (Dr. N!Godatu, The Simpsons) were featured before and after each commercial break. The show's producers toyed with the format during the show's first season. A variety act was added and then scrapped by the third episode. Ullman began opening the show as herself by episode five; this was dropped altogether by season 3 in favor of an elaborate opening title sequence. The final segment of all four seasons sees Ullman, clad in a pink robe, delivering a closing monologue to the studio audience before ending the show with her signature catchphrase, \\"Go home! Go home!\\" and dancing as the credits roll. She chose the phrase \\"Go home,\\" because she couldn't think of anything clever to end with. Her closing monologue is, \\"Oh, you got sore bums. Go home!\\" Development British actress, comedian, singer, and former dancer, Tracey Ullman was encouraged to try and break into American television by her husband, British producer Allan McKeown, who was looking to go into business in the United States. Ullman, who was already a household name in her native England, had already been making the rounds in the US promoting her film and music career in the early 1980s. Unlike in England, Americans weren't aware of her comedy background outside of humorous appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and Late Night with David Letterman. Ullman already had three British comedies under her belt, garnering her awards and accolades. \\"I didn't believe there was anything above Webster standard [in America]. I was wrong.\\" Her British agent put together a compilation of her work and began circulating it around Hollywood. Her tape landed in the lap of Craig Kellem, vice president of comedy at Universal Television. \\"I could not believe my eyes. It was just about the most extraordinary piece of material I'd seen in a long time.\\" He wanted production on a series to begin immediately for her. Saturday Night Live scribe and creator of CBS's Square Pegs, Anne Beatts was hired to write the pilot. Universal liked the script; Ullman reportedly threw her hands up in the air, hating it. Recalling the project: \\"We'd just hit on an idea, then some white- haired executive ‚Äì very, very important ‚Äì would come in from the race track and say, 'I don't like that idea. I think Tracey should be a caring person. I think there should be a kid in this. Now, I'm just pitching here. I don't know if this is funny. But I think Tracey should love this kid and maybe there's a moment where she tells the kid something about life.' And I'd say, \\"Look ‚Äì I don't want to work with little kids being cute who I eventually adopt'.\\" Ullman's new agent, Martha Luttrell sent her tape to James L. Brooks who had a deal with Fox. Fox, dubbed America's \\"fourth network,\\" was looking to create its own brand of original primetime programming. Brooks was bowled over by Ullman's material. \\"I saw original talent, and how often does that happen to you?\\" \\"I started showing [her work] to people like you'd show home movies.\\" \\"I was just startled by the size of the talent. I got chills.\\" Ullman explained to Brooks her situation at CBS and the fact that she was now pregnant. Her convinced her to get out of it and after she had her baby they would do a show together. Brooks felt that a sketch show would best suit her assets (acting, singing, and dancing). \\"Why would you do something with Tracey playing a single character on TV when her talent requires variety? You can't categorize Tracey, so it's silly to come up with a show that attempted to.\\" To ensure that she was well-versed in American comedy, Brooks began sending her tapes of American sitcoms and variety shows to watch and study. Ullman also began visiting and spending time at the Museum of Television & Radio. \\"After I made [the 1985 film] Plenty, I thought it was sad that everyone left London to go home to Hollywood. Thought I'd join 'em. [...] I thought of myself as a Peter Sellers type. No one does American accents better than him. Look at Dr. Strangelove and Lolita.\\" As one critic noted, Sellars had American director Stanley Kubrick as his visionary and Ullman would get American television and film director James L. Brooks, the man behind such hit television shows as The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Taxi, Rhoda. and the films Terms of Endearment and Broadcast News. \\"I came to America in 1985 and James made me stay. If I had a mentor like him in Great Britain, I would've stayed there.\\" \\"Variety hadn't been done for sometime and we wanted to do a show that would allow me to do the things I like to do and can do,\\" stated Ullman in 1987. \\"I think, literally, the word unique and mean it,\\" said James L. Brooks in regards to Ullman's talent. \\"We're so obsessed with comparisons. The only one I could even think of that comparing her to is Peter Sellers ‚Äì he's the only one you can mention. He could do a variety of Americans. And then you have to add that Tracey sings and dances.\\" The key to getting Ullman ready for primetime was \\"assembling the right people\\" according to Brooks. Brooks, along with co- executive Brooks, Jerry Belson, Ken Estin, and Heide Perlman went on a retreat in Northern California to think through the show. \\"We wanted to tell a story, to be involved in character. We did not want to do spoofs or takeoffs. You define a show by what you don't want want to do as well as by what you do. We rushed on the air and have been finding the show while we're on the air. You lose a lot of sleep that way, but it's great. Now we have five or six characters that we repeat from time to time, and new ones are candidates for repetition.\\" When it came to Fox, Brooks stated, \\"It was helpful for us to do the show without any preconceived context. Not only were we new, but so was Fox. There was no notion of something to fit into.\\" Fox was reportedly backing the show with nearly $1,000,000 per broadcast. The series landed an initial 26 episode commitment deal, unheard of for a television comedy; Fox ordered a further 30 episodes in October 1987. Describing the show proved difficult; creator Ken Estin dubbed it a \\"skitcom.\\" An array of original and diverse characters were created for Ullman to perform. Extensive makeup, wigs, teeth, and body padding were utilized, sometimes rendering her completely unrecognizable. One original character created solely by Ullman back in Britain that was uprooted for the show: long-suffering British spinster Kay Clark. Kay was based on a real woman who worked in a Midlands bank that Ullman kept in touch with long after leaving Britain for the United States. \\"Kay\\" would ask her about Hollywood on the telephone; Ullman would subsequently do the voice she heard on the other line to her dog. She had been obsessed with spinsters ever since she was a small child and kept a mental file on them. She never saw \\"Kay\\" and imagined what she looked like. It was \\"Tracey Ullman Show\\" costume designer, Jame Ruhm who suggested a drooping bust and cellulite- covered hips for the character. Ruhm created a costume complete with \\"hydraulic pistons.\\" \\"Tracey is really, really interested in what her characters look like,\\" revealed show costume designer, Jane Ruhm. \\"She is constantly going around collecting pictures of people and coming to me and saying, 'I want to do a character dressed like this!' I file that in my memory, and then we'll get a script and I'll say, 'That character that you wanted to do, can we use it on this?' She'll say, 'Yeah!' And we'll go.\\" \\"It's a real thrill to me that someone like Kay can be famous in America.\\" For other characters, she drew upon people she either knew or celebrities for inspiration. \\"I based one character on Maggie Smith, which the script supervisor suggested. I remember her in California Suite saying, 'Well, I don't care if I didn't win the fucking Oscar.'... It sounded good. It made me laugh, and then I felt that I could do the character.\\" She based the character Francesca on a neighbor, an awkward teenage girl, who would come to visit her in her kitchen and would sheepishly stand in the corner. \\"I wanted to portray painful adolescence, but not an adolescent that was spoiled. I'd seen so many that were just, 'Like I really want to go to the movies, and you're totally stupid.' I didn't want to play a horrible kid.\\" Ullman believed in progressing the characters, adamant that they didn't stagnate. \\"You have to advance the characters [...] you have to find new situations for them [...] They have to do something or say something or grow as people. And they have to be unusual.\\" Like Kay, another character created and performed by Ullman first for British television (Three of a Kind) and then adapted for the Fox show was impoverished housewife Betty Tomlinson. Producers decided to add animated segments when they had trouble figuring out a way to end one sketch and go into the next. They had considered talking animals, specifically a talking bear. \\"I don't know why we were so into a bear,\\" explained Ken Estin. \\"Nobody was in love with that idea, but we just couldn't think of how else to do it. In most variety shows it was just sketches that were so short that they didn't have to worry about from going from one to the next. Nobody had ever really done this before.\\" Estin was given with a drawing of Life in Hell by Matt Groening from Richard Sakai. \\"It was very different. It was smart. It was unusual. It was drawn poorly, which I thought added the charm [...] I said, 'What if we have this guy do these little cartoons in between the scenes? Is that possible? Does anybody like that idea?' They all said they liked the idea. This is how Matt ended up being our guy.\\" James L. Brooks was also familiar with Groening's work. Polly Platt, producer of his film Terms of Endearment had given him a cartoon called \\"Success and Failure in Hollywood\\" drawn by Groening as a gift. Platt suggested that he do a special on the characters. Heide Perlman found another artist to do animated segments ‚Äì M.K. Brown, who worked for The National Lampoon. She agreed to do a cartoon based around a female psychiatrist, Dr. N!Godatu. Producers stopped hearing from Groening when Fox wanted to take over Life in Hell merchandising as part of his deal, resulting in his passing on the project. Estin asked Sakai to ask Groening if he had any characters that he would be willing to allow Fox to merchandise. Groening said that he did have other characters and would send them over for consideration. \\"Well, two, maybe three days after I spoke to Richard, Matt sends us a drawing of the Simpsons exactly as‚Äìwell, not exactly‚Äìalmost exactly as they are. Anyhow, everybody said, 'Fine. That's fine. We like them.' And Matt made his deal with Fox.\\" Eventually, producers found that Groening's work suited the show better than Brown's and her segments were no longer used. Tracey Ullman was approached to do one of the voices of the Simpsons, but with her already spending up to three hours in the makeup chair, adding voice-over work wasn't feasible. Fellow cast member, Julie Kavner then agreed to do it. Groening approached Ullman sporadically about doing a guest voice for the shorts, but with her heavy workload, she never had the time. Early reports regarding the show's premise were as follows: the focal point would be Ullman starring in one long 12-minute \\"playlet,\\" a shorter sketch, some music and a weekly lecture from Harry Shearer. The show would start with no pilot and a 26-episode commitment. The show would be produced by Brooks along with some of the top writers from Cheers. Shearer's weekly lecture never materialized. When it came time to go out and promote the show, Fox only allowed Ullman to tour Los Angeles and New York. In 1988, she insisted that she be allowed to tour Middle America. Never a fan of dialect coaches, this promotional tour would allow her to have ample opportunity to do some character study. \\"I want to see America a bit, I really do. I've only been to L.A. and New York, and they make very disparaging remarks about Middle America there. I mean, Des Moines, Iowa is the place network executives always talk about, like, \\"Would they like this in Des Moines?' They think you just want Facts of Life and She's the Sheriff, that you really want that type of television, and I don't really believe that you do. There's no intelligence, no truth in anything like that. I think you want something a bit smarter. [...] We take pictures everywhere [on this promotional tour]; we're taping people's voices. I'm taking it all in, and it's great. Some journalist once said that I was a 'social satirist,' and I thought, 'That sounds quite intelligent, doesn't?' So that's what I'm doing, I'm meeting people from a social satirist's point of view.\\" Whenever she was stuck on particular voice or accent, she would open a phone directory. \\"If I wanted to do somebody from Brooklyn, I would call the library in Brooklyn and listen to their voice and tape them surreptitiously so they didn't know.\\" Also helping her in her quest for accents was the show's staff. When she had to find a Brooklyn accent distinctive from the Queens accent she used for her character, United States postal worker, Tina, she had the show's staff make a long compilation tape of genuine Brooklyn accents (recordings from radio stations and even randomly placed phone calls placed to random Brooklynites). Ullman would also call car dealerships in different parts of the country pretending to be interested in buying a car just to hear how the people there spoke. =Casting= Dan Castellaneta, a relative unknown, was asked to read for the show after he was spotted by Ullman at Chicago's Second City. Castellaneta's portrayal of a blind man who wants to be a comedian brought her to tears instead of making her laugh.Lawsom, Tim; Persons, Alisa (2004). The Magic Behind the Voices: A Who's Who of Cartoon Voice Actors. University Press of Mississippi, pp. 112. . He gave up the opportunity to appear in the short- lived sitcom version of the film Nothing in Common in which he appeared in order to star in the Ullman show. \\"Tracey always says, 'You're so lucky, Dan. You can always go back to Nothing in Common.\\" joked Castellaneta in a 1988 interview. Describing the show, Castellaneta stated, \\"Essentially what dictates it is that there are no parodies and even if it's an unusual situation, Tracey and (executive producer) Jim Brooks try to keep things as believable and real. You've got to be honest.\\" He would continue to stay true to his Second City philosophy when playing comedy and characters. \\"Don't ever do what's expected. Always try to find a different way of doing something. ...Always play to the top of your intelligence. A character should be as smart as you are. And if the character isn't a smart as you are, you can't make a comment about it, you can't make fun of the character.\\" Castellaneta felt that audiences could see right through a character that wasn't done honestly and that The Tracey Ullman Show's audience were both pretty demanding as well as intelligent. \\"They're people who like something different, they're certainly an intelligent audience. And they're an audience that isn't as easily offended as other people might be.\\" Actress Julie Kavner had co-starred in Brooks' spin-off series to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, starring Valerie Harper. Kavner played Harper's younger, socially awkward sister Brenda, a role for which she won an Emmy Award. Kavner was at the top of the list of people Brooks wanted to be part of the show. Brooks on Kavner: \\"When somebody's intrinsically funny ‚Äì you know, in-their-bones funny ‚Äì they never have to work at (being funny), so they're free to work on other things. We were all nuts about her work. She was the person we most wanted to work with Tracey.\\" Actor Sam McMurray read for a guest spot on the show playing William, lover of thirteen-year-old valley girl Francesca's (Ullman) father. McMurray recalling his casting: \\"The first Francesca sketch, they said, 'Play the guy not so gay.' And I said 'I disagree.' I had a big mouth then -‚Äî still do. I said, 'I think he‚Äôs more the woman. I think he's more out there.' So I read and I read it big, and they cast me. It was just a one-off, and then we were on hiatus. I did the one week, and I had a friend coincidentally who used to write, a guy named Marc Flanagan, and he was on the show as a staff guy. He called me up and said, 'Did they call your agent?' I said, 'No, why?' He said, 'They wanna make you a regular.'\\" McMurray, who didn't become a full-fledged cast member until the sixth episode didn't find himself feeling terrible comfortable at first with the show. McMurray: \\"[T]he social dynamic of the show is an odd one. I spoke with (executive producer) Jim Brooks about this later and I said, 'You know, it's like we're all square pegs, aren't we?' And he said, 'Yeah,' and that the same thing occurred on The Mary Tyler Moore. Everybody was from a different disciple on that show, ‚Äì somebody had been from sitcoms, somebody came from the stage and somebody had been a stand-up comic, and yet whatever the dynamic that was forged from it, it's singular and it works.\\" The last to be cast was dancer Joseph Malone. Malone was originally hired for a guest shot‚Äì acting as a cop who also danced with a possible jumper on a ledge, led to him becoming a series regular. He had worked with acts such as Michael Jackson, Lily Tomlin and Barbara Mandrell. The show now had its cast. During the 1987‚Äì1988 season, Julie Kavner asked to be let out of her contract in order to be able to concentrate on making movies; Kavner had been living in New York while The Tracey Ullman Show taped in Los Angeles. Actress Anna Levine was subsequently cast with Kavner putting in special appearances. =Writing= James L. Brooks knew the importance of good writers and quickly assembled a team for the show, most notably, Heide Perlman and Ken Estin of Cheers fame. Estin also worked on Brooks's Taxi. The pair would also act as executive producers. Also joining the team was Jerry Belson; he also acted as executive producer. Belson had written for such television comedies as The Dick Van Dyke Show. Belson was the writer Ullman warmed to immediately; he was always in her corner. In an interview with The Nerdist Podcast, she recalled Belson saying, \\"'Leave her alone, Jim, she's tired.' [...] He was one of those funny writers that if you said that you didn't like a joke in the room, he'd say, 'What is this, Nazi, Russia?'\\" When they won an Emmy, Belson's response was, \\"This is my first Emmy in color.\\" Sam Simon, like Estin, wrote for Taxi, as well as executive produced the show. Brooks discovered writer Marc Flanagan after watching a piece performed by Meryl Streep and Kevin Klein at a benefit. He asked to speak to the writer and kept him in mind when he worked on the Ullman show as writer and producer. SCTV writers Dick Blasucci and Paul Flaherty wrote and co-produced as well. For each show, a table read would take place on Monday mornings in the presence of writers and producers. It was not unusual for rewrites to go past midnight. What worked in the writers room would sometimes fall flat once in the hands of the actors. The best readings were the result of numerous rewrites. \\"I love cracking a run-through,\\" said Ullman in 1989. \\"It's like a drug. If I can get them looking at me and respecting me, and thinking, 'She's done it!' ‚Äì it's the best feeling.'\\" But she knew that the only performance that truly counted was the final one recorded in front of a live studio audience. \\"You just gotta pray you hit that happy, energetic mood on Friday.\\" The cast rehearsals would take place into lunch and dinner hours, usually under the tutelage of director Ted Bessell. At around 3:30 PM each day, writers and producers, led by James L. Brooks and Jerry Belson, would arrive for a run-through. They would observe, shout out suggestions, make additions, subtractions, and work out any kinks in the production. The show would then be ready to tape by Friday at 7 PM One \\"writer\\" frequently credited on the show, Bonita Carlisle, was actually a nom de plume chosen by the writers room indicating that the sketch had been a group effort. Guest stars such as Steve Martin and Mel Brooks also got heavily involved in their sketch's writing as well. While the Fox network was pretty liberal when it came to the material it would allow the show to put on, by 1989, after controversy stemming from Married... with Children, the network's Standards and Practices department began monitoring the scripts and kowtowing to advocating groups. A sketch consisting of a nun (played by Ullman) a priest and last rites was pulled mid-production. Producers were given the option of either watering down the skit or not doing it at all. Ullman had no problem with the piece. Brooks responded: \\"They're smart enough to know that they can't have a bland network that responds every pressure and be successful ... If we really believe a piece should be broadcast, then we will take a stand. We do care about doing characters accurately and in them taking a comic view of life. But when censorship interferes with that, we've got to scream.\\" =Opening sequence= George Clinton was hired to write and perform the show's funk-infused theme song, \\"You're Thinking Right.\\" Brooks hired animation and graphic design company, Klasky Csupo to design the show's title sequence. It would become the studio's big break. In addition to handing the show's opening, they would also produce the show's animated bumpers. The opening title sequence in seasons 1 and 2 followed a brief introduction by Ullman to the studio audience. For season 3, however, the opening intro was scrapped, and in its place, a live-action farce: Ullman pulls up to the 20th Century Fox lot in her car and hits a pedestrian. She attempts CPR in front of onlookers and revives her victim. She then rushes into the studio and meets George Clinton; a person tries to get her opinion on a costume; Paula Abdul attempts to go over choreography with her. Next, she visits the makeup room and greets her fellow cast mates ‚Äì this includes the Simpson family. She then looks at a pushpin board and stills of that week's sketches are posted. Season 4 featured a similar title sequence to the first two seasons. =Ending= After four seasons, Ullman decided to end the show stating that she was \\"constantly challenged and happily tortured by a unique group of people.\\" She also thanked Fox \\"for letting somebody no one ever heard of do a show on a network that didn't exist.\\" Brooks stated that The Tracey Ullman Show was \\"the hardest work any of us ever did, and we would have continued forever if she had wanted us to [...] I'm just glad I appreciated it as it was happening and not just in retrospect ... Tracey is one of the most talented people alive.\\" The show earned Fox its first-ever Emmy Award, raking up a total of 13 nominations, garnering 4 wins, by the end of its run. Brooks didn't mince words when it was announced in 1992 that Fox chairman, Barry Diller was stepping down. \\"I thought The Tracey Ullman Show should have stayed on as long as she wanted to do it.\\" Diller had been dragging his feet in renewing the show. Tired of waiting, Ullman decided to pull the plug herself. When Ullman and the show won at the 1990 Emmy Awards, newspaper critics hailed: \\"Tracey Ullman Gets Last Laugh.\\" Later, Ullman admitted that she would have liked an additional year to try out all the characters she wanted to play. However, she was proud of what they achieved: \\"no compromises, no giving up, always wanting the best.\\" Episodes Cast and crew =Cast= Cast of The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987.

The show's supporting cast also had their own characters‚Äì usually playing opposite Ullman's, but sometimes in solo sketches of their own. The following is a list of recurring characters performed by Tracey Ullman, Dan Castellanta, Julie Kavner, and Sam McMurray. They are listed in order of appearance. ;The Downeys :Sara and Greg Downey (Ullman and Castellaneta) are two Yuppies who only care for their son Max (played by Nick Rutherford) when they absolutely have to. ;Kay Clark :Originally from England, Kay (Ullman) works in Rhode Island for a paper products distribution company. She's constantly the target of her co-workers and her boss Mr. Le Roy's (Castellaneta) practical jokes. Kay takes care of her invalid mother whom she talks to frequently on the phone from work. ;Dr. Alexander Gibson :A psychiatrist played by Dan Castallenta. Many of Ullman's characters are analyzed by him (e.g. Kay Clark, Brenda, Kiki Howard-Smith). ;Brenda :A neurotic and ditzy Valley girl and a patient of Dr. Alexander Gibson, played by Tracey Ullman. ;Francesca McDowell :A 14-year-old girl (Ullman) who's raised by her father David (Castellaneta) and his partner William (McMurray). ;Sandra Decker :A faded Oscar-winning actress from the Golden Age of Hollywood, played by Tracey Ullman. ;Tina and Meg :Tina (Ullman) and Meg (Kavner) are best friends and United States postal workers. ;Kiki Howard-Smith :An Australian professional golfer, played by Tracey Ullman. ;Ginny Tilman :Ginny (Ullman), a bitter divorc√©e of Dr. Lawrence Tillman (Castellaneta), a Beverly Hills proctologist. Lawrence goes on to remarry Meg (played by Isabella Rossellini). Ginny's sister Roz (Kavner) who is married to perpetually unenthusiastic Leonard (McMurray), cares for their mother. ;Summer Storm :A burned-out hippie DJ. ;Gulliver Dark :A lounge singer played by Sam McMurray. Gulliver's fan base, consisting mainly of middle-aged women, become \\"Dark Ladies\\" once they've watched him perform 1,000 times or more, and have given him gifts equal to 10% of their income. Gulliver is nicknamed \\"The Velvet Bulge.\\" The character went on to appear in The Simpsons, voiced by both Sam McMurray and George Balmaseda. ;Angel and Marty Tish :Angel and Marty (Ullman and Castellaneta) are a husband-and-wife duo, dubbing themselves \\"America's Sweethearts.\\" ;Margaret/Hans Neeman :Psychiatrist and mentor to Dr. Alexander Gibson, played by Tracey Ullman. Margaret reunites with her former student, Dr. Gibson as a patient and admits to having been a fraud; she later returns in a second sketch after having transitioned into Hans. ;Gigi :A woman, played by Tracey Ullman, who is put through the paces no matter where she goes (e.g. a job interview where she's given 60 seconds to come up with an elaborate tab dance routine; a therapy session where she's forced to figure out who is the therapist and who is patient). ;The Sours :Gary and Joanie Sours, a newlywed couple, played by Sam McMurray and Tracey Ullman. ;Maria :An Hispanic maid, played by Tracey Ullman. ;Ann B. Cooper :A cat lady, played by Tracey Ullman. Ann is on the McDowell's co-op apartment's board of directors and is responsible for getting their application accepted. ;Rosaria and Big Tony Manetti :Rosaria (Ullman), and her husband, Big Tony (played by Robert Costanzo), are an Italian-American couple who live in Jersey City who constantly argue with one another. ;Miranda Kenton :A very self-involved Hollywood actress, played by Tracey Ullman. Animated segments The Tracey Ullman Show regularly featured short animated cartoons as interstitials in the first three seasons. There was no recurring cartoon during season 4. =Dr. N!Godatu= Dr. N!Godatu was a series of animated shorts created by M.K. Brown, and animated by Klasky-Csupo. It was seen during season 1 only, and was the first cartoon seen on Ullman's show. The shorts followed the somewhat surreal life of Dr. Janice N!Godatu, who calmly and cheerfully addressed the camera as she detailed her latest misadventure. The character was voiced by Julie Payne. The feature appeared in the first two Ullman episodes, then alternated more-or-less every other week with the Simpsons shorts (see below). After appearing 6 times, Dr. N!Godatu was dropped at the conclusion of the first season of Ullman's show. Two additional Dr. N!Godatu cartoons that were prepared for the show never aired. =The Simpsons= The Simpson family debuted in short animated cartoons on The Tracey Ullman Show, beginning with episode 3 of the first season. The shorts originally were presented on an occasional basis, alternating episodes with Dr. N!Godatu. However, the reaction to the Simpsons shorts was very positive, and after appearing 7 times during season 1, the feature was quickly promoted to full-time status, appearing in every episode of seasons 2‚Äì3 before being spun off into their own half-hour series. These shorts, also called \\"bumpers\\", aired before and after commercial breaks during the first and second seasons of the show. They eventually had their own full segments in between the live action segments during season three. Except for a repeat airing of the short \\"Simpson Xmas,\\" they did not appear in the fourth and final season of The Tracey Ullman Show, as they had their own half-hour TV series by then. All of them were written by Matt Groening and animated at Klasky-Csupo by a team of animators consisting of David Silverman, Wes Archer, and Bill Kopp. Tracey Ullman Show cast members Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner provide the voices of Homer Simpson and Marge Simpson respectively. In the beginning, the drawings appeared very crude because the animators were more or less just tracing over Groening's storyboards, but as the series developed, so did the designs and layouts of the characters and the \\"Simpsons drawing style\\" was ultimately conceived. This style evolved even more throughout the first few seasons of The Simpsons and was used more than a decade later on Futurama, another animated series created by Groening. Reception Ullman at the 41st Primetime Emmy Awards on September 17, 1989 =Critical= While the show was a critical darling, it was never a ratings juggernaut; although none of the early newly launched primetime Fox network shows generated a significant return (Fox didn't crack the top 30 in the Nielsen ratings until 1990 with The SimpsonsHighest-rated series is based on the annual top-rated programs list compiled by Nielsen Media Research and reported in: ). On the show's ratings, Fox president, Jamie Kellner was quoted in 1988 as saying, \\"We're too new new to be discouraged by ratings [...] It's true that it's harder to discover Tracey on Fox than on NBC.\\" But as critic Howard Rosenberg of The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post pointed out, it was probably easier for her to survive, as the show she was producing was probably too \\"rule-bending\\" for NBC to be interested in in the first place. The show faced practical obstacles reaching viewers, one of which was the network broadcasting via UHF signal. Ullman was personally critical of Fox messing with the show's timeslot, something network chairman Barry Diller would later concede. \\"I think there was real anger about the shifting time a lot, and that it was legitimate. Networks do many things that are not necessarily in the interests of a particular show, and those things are not always smart. We had a very large audience for a very special show-but it wasn't large enough. Certain things take time. As the world speeds up, the rhythm of this show will become consistent with the rhythm of the audience. But it might take ten years. I think the eighty-something shows they did will be like The Honeymooners. I don't know when. But it's going to be pure, driven gold. We expect to get every nickel back. Plus, plus, plus.\\" \\"It should've been on Sunday night. I think a great lineup would've been The Simpsons followed by Tracey, on Sunday night.\\", said Matt Groening in 1991. Despite its issues in the ratings, the show retained a devoted fan base and became a cult hit up until the end. It also helped the Fox network gain credibility within the industry. Married... with Children, the series which launched the same night as the Ullman show, was mired in controversy and soon became branded lowbrow humor. =Accolades= The show won a total of 11 Emmy Awards including Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Program in 1989 and 1990, and Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program in 1990. Also in 1989, choreographer Paula Abdul won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography for her work on the show. Distribution =International= When The Tracey Ullman Show first appeared in Ullman's native England, the BBC decided to cut six minutes from the show, specifically the Simpsons shorts. \\"The BBC said the only thing they didn't like about the show was those weird little animated characters and suggested maybe they could get rid of them because they would never catch on,\\" recalled Ullman. Despite their aversion to the cartoon shorts, she attempted to convince the broadcaster to buy the rights to The Simpsons television series, telling them it would be a mistake not to; Sky ended up buying the show. The Tracey Ullman Show aired on BBC Two in the UK and Network 10 in Australia. =Syndication= Re-runs of the show appeared on Lifetime and Comedy Central throughout the 1990s in the United States. Home media To date The Tracey Ullman Show has never been commercially released through any home media platform. In 2017, in an interview, Tracey Ullman theorized that music clearance issues may be the reason for this. A selection of the Simpsons shorts were released from 1997 through 1999 on The Simpsons VHS home video releases. The sketch \\"Due Dilligence\\" featuring actor-comedian Mel Brooks was released as an extra on The Incredible Mel Brooks: An Irresistible Collection of Unhinged Comedy in 2012.

Berkeley Engineering Fund, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, and sits on the Advisory Boards of the Oxford Internet Institute. Simons has also served as a Professor at Stanford University. Voting technology policy After leaving IBM and serving as ACM President, Simons began working to reverse the dangers of using unverifiable technology in voting. In 2001 she participated in the National Workshop on Internet Voting under President Clinton, where she helped produce a report on Internet Voting. She subsequently served on the President‚Äôs Export Council‚Äôs Subcommittee on Encryption, as well as on the Information Technology-Sector of the President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion. Barbara held one of her first public outcries of unverifiable voting technology in 2003 because election officials in Silicon Valley wanted to switch to paperless machines. Now, Barbara serves as a board chair at Verified Voting. She also co-chaired the ACM study of statewide databases of registered voters. She participated on the Security Peer Review Group for the US Department of Defense‚Äôs Internet voting project (SERVE) and co-authored the report that led to the cancellation of SERVE because of security concerns 2004.David Jefferson, Aviel D. Rubin, Barbara Simons and David Wagner, A Security Analysis of the Secure Electronic Registration and Voting Experiment (SERVE) , Jan. 20, 2004.Press Release, [Pentagon Decides Against Internet Voting ], American Forces Press Service, Feb. 6, 2004. In addition to serving on the Board of Directors of the Verified Voting Foundation, Simons has worked for legislation to remove paperless voting machines and published various work about it. She played a key role in changing the League of Women Voters support and use of paperless voting.Ronnie Dugger, \\"How They Could Steal the Election This Time\\", The Nation, p.13 August 16/23, 2004 Initially the League had seen electronic voting as better for disabled people, then endorsed voting machines that are \\"recountable\\" after Simons. In 2008 she was appointed by Senator Harry Reid to the U.S Election Assistance Commission Board of Advisors, where she contributed to \\"Help America Vote Act\\" (HAVA). In 2009 she co-authored the League of Women Voters report on election auditing.Election Audits Task Force, Report on Election Auditing, League of Women Voters of the United States, Jan. 2009. With fellow computer scientist Douglas Jones, she co-authored a book about electronic voting machines in 2012, titled ‚ÄúBroken Ballots: Will Your Vote Count?‚Äù.Douglas W. Jones and Barbara Simons, Broken Ballots, Center for the Study of Language and Information / University of Chicago Press, 2012. See also Following this, in July 2015 she published another report about electronic voting for the U.S. Vote Foundation entitled The Future of Voting: End-to-End Verifiable Internet Voting.

Upgrades and reorganizations are shown only to identify the variant names for what is notionally a single unit; other upgrades and reorganizations are deferred to the individual articles. Due to the scope of this list, pre-war changes are not shown, nor are upgrades from units smaller than a division. Most of these divisions trained in Berlin, which is also where new military technology was kept and tested.

There was a series of 5 Light divisions; the first four were pre-war mechanized formations organized for use as mechanized cavalry, and the fifth was an ad hoc collection of mechanized elements rushed to Africa to help the Italians and organized into a division once there. All five were eventually converted to ordinary Panzer divisions. * 1st Light Division (later 6th Panzer Division) * 2nd Light Division (later 7th Panzer Division) * 3rd Light Division (later 8th Panzer Division) * 4th Light Division (later 9th Panzer Division) * 5th Light Afrika Division (later 21st Panzer Division) Various other divisions were dubbed \\"Light\\" for other reasons, and are listed among the Infantry Series Divisions. =Infantry series divisions= Motorized Infantry Division 1941 Motorized Infantry Division 1943 =Types of division in the series= The backbone of the Heer (German Army) was the infantry division. Of the 154 divisions deployed against Soviet Union in 1941, including reserves, there were 100 infantry, 19 panzer, 11 motorised, 9 security, 5 Waffen-SS, 4 \\"light\\", 4 mountain, 1 SS police, and 1 cavalry. A typical infantry division in June 1941 had 17,734 men organized into the following sub-units:Mueller-Hillebrand B., Das Heer, 1933-1945. vol. II, E.S. Mittler & Sohn, 1969, pp. 161-162. *three infantry regiments with staff and communications units **three battalions with: ***three infantry companies ***one heavy weapons company **one anti-tank company (mot.) **one artillery company **one reconnaissance unit *one tank destroyer battalion with: **three companies (each with twelve 3.7 cm guns) *one artillery regiment **three battalions ***three batteries *one pioneer battalion *one communications unit *one field replacement battalion *Supply, medical, veterinary, mail, and police German infantry divisions had a variety of designations and specializations, though numbered in a single series. The major variations are as follows: ;Fortress (Festung): Divisions of non- standard organization used to garrison critical sites. The smaller ones might consist of only two or three battalions. ;Grenadier: A morale-building honorific usually indicative of reduced strength when used alone. ;J√§ger: Reduced in size with only two regiments compared to an ordinary infantry divisions three and provided with less transport and lighter artillery. Those divisions were trained to fight in difficult terrain. ;Light (Leichte): There were several meanings of the term light division in the Wehrmacht: *The initial light infantry divisions. Lighter than a normal infantry division; they had only two regiments and no heavy artillery. Most of them were converted to J√§ger divisions in 1942. *The light Africa divisions. Created partially ad-hoc and sporting a unique composition, e.g. including penal units, they were usually lighter than a standard infantry divisions. *The light division. Any division with a lack of units, like only having two regiments, or less support units could be styled light. Usually only applied temporarily to a division; the respective unit would be drawn off from the front to reorganize and renamed again after it regained the lost units and manpower. *The light (mechanized) divisions that were the predecessors of the Panzer divisions. Those are already covered in the Panzer division section. ;Motorized: Provided with full motor transport for all infantry and weapons systems. Usually reduced in size compared to an ordinary infantry division. Motorized infantry divisions were renamed Panzergrenadier (armored infantry) divisions in 1943. ;Division Nummer: A sort of placeholder division, with a number (Nummer) and staff but few if any combat assets. These divisions started out without any type in their name (e.g., Division Nr. 179), though some acquired a type later on (e.g., Panzer Division Nr. 179). ;Panzergrenadier: As motorized, but with more self-propelled weapons and an added battalion of tanks or fully armored assault guns. What motorized divisions were referred to from 1943 forward. ;Security Division (Sicherungs- Division): Designed for mopping-up duties in the rear areas; may consist of two reinforced regiments or of a number of independent battalions. ;Static (bodenst√§ndige): Deficient in transport, even enough to move its own artillery. Many of these were divisions that had been mauled on the Eastern Front and were sent west to serve as coastal defense garrisons until sufficient resources were available to rehabilitate them. ;Volksgrenadier: A late-war reorganization with reduced size and increased short-range firepower. Many previously destroyed or badly mauled infantry divisions were reconstituted as Volksgrenadier divisions, and new ones were raised as well. Their fighting worth varied widely depending on unit experience and equipment. Not to be confused with Volkssturm a national militia in which units were supposed to be organized by local Nazi party leaders; trained by the SS; and come under Wehrmacht command in combat. ;zbV: (\\"zbV\\" is an abbreviation meaning \\"for special employment\\") An ad hoc division created to meet a special requirement. (E.g., Division zbV Afrika) Most of the size reductions listed above were by about a third, either by the removal of an infantry regiment or the removal of one infantry battalion from each of the three regiments. Infantry divisions were raised in waves, sets of divisions with a standardized table of organization and equipment. In general the later waves (i.e., the higher-numbered divisions) were of lower quality than the earlier ones.

The town is situated 95 km (60 mi) by road south from Jaipur, near the right bank of the Banas River. It is the administrative headquarters of Tonk District. Tonk was also the capital of the eponymous princely state of British India from 1817 to 1947. Demographics In the 2011 Indian census, Tonk had a population of 165,363, with 48% being female. 14% of the population under age six. Tonk has an average literacy rate of 69.47%: 78.7% in males, and 59.85% in females.  History  The founder of the state and its first ruler was Nawab Muhammad Amir Khan (1769‚Äì1834), an adventurer and military leader of Pashtun descent from Afghanistan. Amir Khan rose to be a military commander. In 1806, Khan conquered the area, taking it from Yashwant Rao Holkar. The British government captured it in turn. Khan then received the state of Tonk from the British Government who returned it. In 1817, after the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Amir Khan submitted to the British British East India Company and kept his territory of Tonk while receiving the title of Nawab.Princely States of India Tonk was founded one year later after Khan was granted land by the ruler of Indore. During the regime of Nawabs, the natives were invited to an Islamic function of Milad-un-nabi without regard to caste, color or creed. It was organised by the ruling Nawabs for a period of seven days in the month of Rabi al-awwal. Tonk was known as Samwad Lakshya in the Mahabharat period. In the Mauryan regime, it was under the Mouryas and then it was merged into Malvas. Most of the period was under Harsh Vardhan. According to Huen Tsang, visitor to China, it was under Bairath State. In the regime of the Rajputs, this state was under, Solankis of Toda and later Kachvahs took over when Man Singh defeated the Rao of Toda. Later, it was under the regime of Holkar and Sindhia.

It is close to the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality in Gauteng, which includes Pretoria, and it has the same dialling code as Pretoria. In addition to being a centre for agriculture, the town is home to several heavy industries. A factory of the Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo produced cars for the domestic market and export to Asia from 1974 to 1985. The town also plays an important role in the South African mining industry: 94% of South Africa's platinum comes from the Rustenburg and Brits districts, which together produce more platinum than any other single area in the world. In addition, there is a large vanadium mine in the district. Mothotlung, Letlhabile, and Oukasie are the black townships, with Oukasie founded in 1931 being one of the oldest townships in South Africa.The Indian area in Brits is Primindia. Brits is part of the Madibeng Local Municipality. Brits is linked to Sandton by the R511 and to Randburg by the R512, and to Pretoria by the R513 and the R514. Freeway access is by the N4 Bakwena Toll Route, which was constructed in the early 2000s. History The first European to build a pioneer hut in the area was Albertus Venter circa 1840. He settled down with his wife and daughter on the farm which is today known as De Kroon and started farming. The Fourie family soon joined him and on 13 June 1846 the first white baby was born in this area north of the Magaliesberg. Phillipus Fourie eventually bought the farm from Venter and he put up the first permanent homestead that became known as the \\"Ou Werf\\". The railway station called Brits was opened on 9 July 1906 and residents began putting up small businesses on the southern side of it. The station was built on the property of Johan Nicolaas Brits that owned part of the farm Roodekopjes. He was previously the first owner of the farm Bloemfontein which he sold to Capt. Warden. In 1918 a steam driven roller mill was built west of the station and served the farming community for many decades. Mail now arrived by train and it became the station master's job to sort out the people's mail. The first post office was built on the station in 1915, and the first post master was Haydon Thomas. It was in this little building that the first telephone was installed and it was operated by Miss Theron. The first police station was established in 1921 and Sergeant Prinsloo was the first station commander. A little village began to develop around the main road on the southern side of the station, which later became known as Tom Street. Unfortunately no proper town planning was done and this area had no access to running water. A businessman by the name of Louis Karovsky, bought the part of Hendrik Christiaan Brits' farm to the north of the rail road. This section was cut up into 940 stands and legally proclaimed as a township in October 1923.Agter die Magalies by B.K. de Beer, published by www.kameeldoringboeke.co.za, The area south of the railway station eventually become the Indian area of Primindia, with Tom Street as its primary business node. Brits was founded in 1924 on the farm Roode Kopjes (Red Hills) and was named after the owner, Johannes Nicolaas Brits. The armistice treaty for the Transvaal civil war was signed in 1864 beneath a karee tree just to the south of Brits. A speech by General Hertzog in 1912 at the nearby De Wildt railway station led to the formation of the National Party. Animals The De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre, renowned for its success in breeding and studying cheetah, king cheetah, brown hyena, suni, blue duiker and wild dogs is situated in the small town of De Wildt, just east of Brits. Ukutula Lodge and conservation center is also based in Brits. Ukutula is home to a number of wild cat species and is a registered Wildlife Breeding and trading facility, as well as an animal rescue center. Brits is also the birthplace of the first cloned animal in Africa, a cow. Education Brits is home to a number of Primary and Secondary Schools.

As is typical for a late-19th-century vessel, several deckhouses may be seen. A deck is a permanent covering over a compartment or a hullEdwards, Fred (illustrated by Sollers, Jim); Sailing as a Second Language: An illustrated dictionary; International Marine Publishing Company; ¬© 1988 Highmark Publishing Ltd.; . of a ship. On a boat or ship, the primary or upper deck is the horizontal structure that forms the \\"roof\\" of the hull, strengthening it and serving as the primary working surface. Vessels often have more than one level both within the hull and in the superstructure above the primary deck, similar to the floors of a multi-storey building, that are also referred to as decks, as are certain compartments and decks built over specific areas of the superstructure. Decks for some purposes have specific names. Structure The main purpose of the upper or primary deck is structural, and only secondarily to provide weather-tightness and support people and equipment. The deck serves as the lid to the complex box girder which can be identified as the hull. It resists tension, compression, and racking forces. The deck's scantling is usually the same as the topsides, or might be heavier if the deck is expected to carry heavier loads (for example a container ship). The deck will be reinforced around deck fittings such as the capstan, cleats, or bollards. RMS Queen Mary2, an ocean liner On ships with more than one level, deck refers to the level itself. The actual floor surface is called the sole, the term deck refers to a structural member tying the ships frames or ribs together over the keel. In modern ships, the interior decks are usually numbered from the primary deck, which is #1, downward and upward. So the first deck below the primary deck will be #2, and the first above the primary deck will be #A2 or #S2 (for \\"Above\\" or \\"Superstructure\\"). Some merchant ships may alternatively designate decks below the primary deck, usually machinery spaces, by numbers, and those above it, in the accommodation block, by letters. Ships may also call decks by common names, or (especially on cruise ships) may invent fanciful and romantic names for a specific deck or area of that specific ship, such as the Lido deck of the Princess Cruises' Love Boat. Equipment mounted on deck, such as the ship's wheel, binnacle, fife rails, and so forth, may be collectively referred to as deck furniture. Weather decks in western designs evolved from having structures fore (forward or front) and aft (rear) of the ship mostly clear; in the 19th century, pilothouses/wheelhouses and deckhouses began to appear, eventually developing into the superstructure of modern ships. Eastern designs developed earlier, with efficient middle decks and minimalist fore and aft cabin structures across a range of designs.  Common names for decks  Vasa looking aft toward the sterncastle In vessels having more than one deck there are various naming conventions, numerically, alphabetically, etc. However, there are also various common historical names and types of decks: * 01 level is the term used in naval services to refer to the deck above the main deck. The next higher decks are referred to as the 02 level, the 03 level, and so on. Although these are formally called decks, they are usually referred to as levels, because they are usually incomplete decks that do not extend all the way from the stem to the stern or across the ship. *Afterdeck an open deck area toward the stern-aft. * Berth deck: (Naval) A deck next below the gun deck, where the hammocks of the crew are slung. * Boat deck: Especially on ships with sponsons, the deck area where lifeboats or the ship's gig are stored. * Boiler deck: (river steamers) The passenger deck above the vessel's boilers. * Bridge deck: (a) The deck area including the helm and navigation station, and where the Officer of the Deck/Watch will be found, also known as the conn (b) An athwartships structure at the forward end of the cockpit with a deck, often somewhat lower than the primary deck, to prevent a pooping wave from entering through the companionway. May also refer to the deck of a bridge. * Flight deck: (Naval) A deck from which aircraft take off or land. * Flush deck: Any continuous unbroken deck from stem to stern. * Forecastle deck: A partial deck above the main deck under which the sailors have their berths, extending from the foremast to the bow. * Freeboard deck: assigned by a classification society to determine the ship's freeboard; usually the highest continuous deck, i.e. equivalent to the main deck. * Gun deck: (Naval) on a multi-decked vessel, a deck below the upper deck where the ships' cannon were carried. The term originally referred to deck for which the primary function was the mounting of cannon to be fired in broadsides. However, on many smaller and unrated vessels the upper deck, forecastle and quarterdeck bore all of the cannons but were not referred to as the gun deck. * Hangar deck: (Naval) A deck aboard an aircraft carrier used to store and maintain aircraft. * Half-deck: That portion of the deck next below the forecastle or quarterdeck which is between the mainmast and the cabin. * Helicopter deck (Heli or Helo deck): Usually located near the stern and always kept clear of obstacles hazardous to a helicopter landing. * Hurricane deck: (River Steamers, etc.), the upper deck, usually a light deck, erected above the frame of the hull (deriving its name from the wind that always seemed to blow on the deck).Hurricane Deck * Lido deck: Open area, typically at or near the stern of a passenger ship, housing the main outdoor swimming pool and sunbathing area. * Lower deck: (a) the deck immediately over the hold, orig. only of a ship with two decks.Oxford English Dictionary. \\"Lower n.4\\". Mar. 2009 Online edition. Retrieved 2009-04-06. (b) synonym for berth deck. (c) alternative name for a secondary gun deck * Main deck: The principal deck of a vessel; in some ships the highest deck of the hull, usually but not always the weather deck; in sailing warships often a deck under the upper deck. * Middle or Waist deck: The upper deck amidships, the working area of the deck. * Orlop deck: The deck or part of a deck where the cables are stowed, usually below the waterline. It is the lowest deck in a ship.Oxford English Dictionary. \\"Orlop n.\\". Mar. 2009 Online edition. Retrieved 2009-04-06. * Poop deck: The deck forming the roof of a poop or poop cabin, built on the upper deck and extending from the mizzenmast aft. * Promenade deck: A \\"wrap-around porch\\" found on passenger ships and riverboats encircling the superstructure. This can have open railings or be enclosed in glass, or a combination. Often the entire level where this is located is referred to as the promenade deck. * Quarterdeck: (a) The part of the upper deck abaft the mainmast, including the poop deck when there is one. Usually reserved for ship's officers, guests, and passengers. (b) (Naval) The shipboard area, connected by a gangplank to a dock or another ship, where personnel arrive and depart a naval vessel in port. It is where the Officer of the Deck and his assistants are stationed, official visitors received, and personnel arrival/departure ceremonies conducted. In the event of multiple gangplanks, only one will lead to the official Quarterdeck; the others will be manned by Junior OODs or a Petty Officer of the Watch. The Quarterdeck also functions as an administrative point in port, where the ship's log is maintained, announcements are made via the 1MC (public address system; \\"Tannoy\\" in some navies), the ship's bell rung, etc. (c) (Naval) Some ships have a space named \\"Quarterdeck\\", usually amidships, that normally, but situationally may not, be used for that purpose. *Shelter deck: A lightly-constructed deck over the main deck of a ship covering a space open to the weather; offering some protection from the weather but not completely enclosedShelter deck at Merriam Webster; retrieved 30 June 2018 * Side-deck: The upper deck outboard of any structures such as a coachroof or doghouse, also called a breezeway * Spar deck: In larger vessels during the age of sail, spare spars could be roped together to provide a temporary surface known as a \\"spar deck\\". These served as jury-rigged repairs for permanent decks, or as an additional platform under which to shelter goods or crew. The term was also informally applied to areas of the forecastle or quarterdeck where spare spars were stored by laying them flat against the existing decking. In the modern era the term has been used to describe the uppermost deck on flush decked vessels. On Great Lakes bulk freighters this is the term used for the deck over the cargo holds. * Steerage: The lower deck of a ship, where the cargo is stored above the closed hold. In the late 19th and early 20th century, steamship steerage decks were used to provide the lowest cost and lowest class of travel. The sun deck of MS Mariella. * Sundeck: A deck onboard passenger watercraft used for suntanning. . * Sweep deck: (Naval) The aftmost deck on a minesweeper, set close to the waterline for ease in launch and recovery of equipment. * Topgallant forecastle deck: Any raised deck occurring above the forecastle deck (see above). * Tween deck: the storage space between the hold and the main deck, often retractable. * Upper deck: The highest deck of the hull, extending from stem to stern. * Vehicle deck: (Naval) aboard amphibious assault ships the deck or decks used to carry vehicles, aboard civilian ferries and other commercial vessels a deck used for a similar purpose. * Weather deck: (a) Any deck exposed to the outside.Webster, Noah Ed.; Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, 1913; Project Gutenberg (Section T, U, V, and W: eText number 669) (b) The windward side-decks. * Well deck: (a) An exposed deck (weather deck) lower than decks fore and aft. In particular it is one enclosed by bulwarks limiting flow of water and thus drainage. (b) (Modern naval) A hangar-like deck located at the waterline in the stern of some amphibious assault ships, also known as a well dock. By taking on water the ship can lower the stern, flooding the well deck and allowing boats and landing craft to dock within the ship.  Construction  = Methods in wood = A traditional wood deck would consist of planks laid fore and aft over beams and along carlins, the seams of which are caulked and paid with tar. A yacht or other fancy boat might then have the deck canvased, with the fabric laid down in a thick layer of paint or sealant, and additional coats painted over. The wash or apron boards form the joint between the deck planking and that of the topsides, and are caulked similarly. Modern \\"constructed decks\\" are used primarily on fiberglass, composite, and cold-molded hulls. The under structure of beams and carlins is the same as above. The decking itself is usually multiple layers of marine-grade plywood, covered over with layers of fibreglass in a plastic resin such as epoxy or polyester overlapped onto the topsides of the hull. = Methods in metal = Generally speaking, the method outlined for \\"constructed decks\\" is most similar to metal decks. The deck plating is laid over metal beams and carlins and tacked temporarily in place. The difficulty in metal construction is avoiding distortion of the plate while welding due to the high heat involved in the process. Welds are usually double pass, meaning each seam is welded twice, a time-consuming process which may take longer than building the wood deck. However, welds result in a waterproof deck which is strong and easily repairable. The deck structure is welded to the hull, making it structurally a single unit. Because a metal deck, painted to reduce corrosion, can pick up heat from the sun, and be quite slippery and noisy to work on, a layer of wood decking or thick non-skid paint is often applied to its surface. = Methods in fiberglass = The process for building a deck in fiberglass is the same as for building a hull: a female mould is built, a layer of gel coat is sprayed in, then layers of fiberglass in resin are built up to the required deck thickness (if the deck has a core, the outer skin layers of fiberglass and resin are laid, then the core material, and finally the inner skin layers.) The deck is removed from the mould and usually mechanically fastened to the hull. Fiberglass decks are quite slick with their mirror-smooth surfaces, so a non-skid texture is often moulded into their surface, or non-skid pads glued down in working areas. = Rules of thumb to determine the deck scantlings = The thickness of the decking affects how strong the hull is, and is directly related to how thick the skin of the hull itself is, which is of course related to how large the vessel is, the kind of work it is expected to do, and the kind of weather it may reasonably be expected to endure. While a naval engineer or architect may have precise methods of determining what the scantlings should be, traditional builders used previous experiences and simpler rules-of-thumb to determine how thick the deck should be built. The numbers derived by these formulae gives a rough number for determining the average thickness of materials based on some crude hull measurements. Below the waterline the thickness should be approximately 115% of the result, while upper topsides and decks might be reduced to 85% of the result. * In wood ‚Äì For plank thickness in inches, LOA (Length OverAll) and Beam are measured in feet.

After flowing through Edenbridge and passing Hever Castle, the Eden meets the Medway at Penshurst.Issues at The name 'Eden' is a back-formation from Edenbridge, (Eadhelmsbrigge (Eadhelm's Bridge) in Old English). Course The Eden rises at the foot of the North Downs in Titsey parish, Surrey (grid reference TQ 420 551), about 350 metres north of Clacket Lane motorway services. It initially runs southwestwards through Oxted, before turning south. From its source to its confluence with the Gibbs Brook (which it meets to the north of Crowhurst), the Eden is also known as the Broadmead Water. Downstream of Haxted Mill, the river meets its principal tributary, the Eden Brook, and turns eastwards to enter Kent above Edenbridge. The river continues to flow eastwards, feeding the ornamental lake at Hever Castle, before turning southeastwards to meet the Medway at Penshurst. Much of the catchment area of the Eden lies on Weald Clay. Water quality According to the Environmental Change Network, water quality in the Eden is mainly classified as General Quality Assessment (GQA) Class C, although the headwaters near Oxted are Class D. The river receives treated sewage effluent from two Southern Water sewage treatment works (STW), serving Edenbridge and Oxted respectively; the stretches receiving these effluents are both subject to EC Urban Water Treatment \\"Sensitive Waters\\" investigations.

Hedgecourt Mill, Felbridge TQ 359 404 This was an old hammer mill site. The mill was first mentioned in 1562 when John Thorpe was listed as repairing buildings, the mill and banks to the value of ¬£64. He was leasing the manor of Hedgecourt from the Gage family of Firle at the time. In 1567 John Thorpe took out a 21 year lease on the mill, the mills being described as \\"newly erected\\" and having an overshot waterwheel. In 1594, the mill was in the tenancy of Thomas Thorpe, son of John Thorpe. In 1652, the mill was in the tenance of Robert Filkes of Godstone. In 1663, John Finch took out an eleven- year lease on Hedgecourt Mill. A toll chest is mentioned in the lease, indicating that the mill was a corn mill, at least in part. He was still there in 1669, paying a half-yearly rent of ¬£14 and tax of 2/-. By March 1670 Joseph Marchant had joined him, but he died in 1674. His widow Sarah took out a lease on the mill in October of that year. The mill passed to her son John in 1688. In 1701, Joseph Marchant (son of John) was at the mill. He built or extended a house in 1701, possibly an extension to the mill. In 1723, Joseph Marchant renewed his lease on the mill and in 1739 James Marchant (son of Joseph) took a sixty-year lease with William Clayton of Marden on of Hedgecourt Heath in Horne, on which to erect a windmill. The mill was an open trestle post mill. Joseph Marchant seems to have retired by 1742. An unexecuted lease of 1743 mentions that the miller has permission to take timber for the purpose of making charcoal (used in the smelting of iron). The site remained in the ownership of the Gage family until 1745, when Colonel Edward Evelyn bought it. It was a furnace mill at that time. Edward Evelyn commissioned a map of his new estate. This was drawn by J Bourd of Tunbridge Wells, Kent in 1748. James Marchant was still at the mill in 1773, when he bequeathed all his possessions to his brother Benjamin Marchant, a cooper and innkeeper of Cheam, Surrey. James Marchant seems to have retired in the 1780s. The next known millers were Messrs Stenning, Lock and Stone are recorded as paying rent for the Mill at Hedgecourt. This can only be the watermill as the windmill had gone by 1789. Thomas Stone was the miller in 1814, followed by his son John, who was joined by Laurence Hardy by 1822. John Saunders was the miller in 1840, having previously been at Wiremill. Saunders was still at the mill in 1855 when it was sold by Lady Selina Charlotte, Viscountess Milton to George Gatty. At that time the mill had an diameter overshot waterwheel driving two pairs of millstones. John Tully Coomber had joined Saunders by 1858, working the mill until at least 1861. George Gatty died in 1864 and the mill passed to his son Charles Henry Gatty. Robert Bartley was the miller in 1869, working the mill until at least 1871 and then Sydney Killick was the miller in 1881, followed by Thomas Colvin who was there in 1891. Charles Gatty died in 1903, and the mill passed to two of his cousins, Charles Lane Sayer and Alfred Leighton Sayer. The mill was probably still operable at this time. In 1910 the mill was sold to Percy Portway Harvey, and in 1916 the mill was in the ownership of Henry Willis Rudd, later passing to a Belgian by the name of Mr Honore Dubar. The mill was visited by Robert Thurston Hopkins in 1926, the machinery still being intact at this time. The mill was also visited by Jack Hillier in 1948, while researching his book on Surrey watermills. By this time the mill was a ruin, still containing its machinery. The upper floors of the mill were demolished in 1949 with the lower part of the mill being used as a boat store. in 1962, the Dubars sold the mill to John Edwards. The mill house was condemned in 1964 and stood empty until 1969. The building being then converted and extended to form two residences. ;Machinery Overshot waterwheel, cast iron spokes, wooden soleboard and buckets, diameter by wide on an oak axle, driving a diameter cast iron pit wheel with oak cogs.

Felbridge An old hammer mill site, at work from 1567 to 1786. One of the names indicates that the mill was a drawing mill at one time. In 1533, the effects of Thomas Gaynesford included a hammer mill. The property had been bough by Gaynesford from Sir John Gage in 1550. In 1559, Nicholas Norton was a miller grinding grain near lands called Shawnors, followed by John Myller in 1560 to 1563, when John Rodgers succeeded him. in 1567, Wiremill was being worked by John Thorpe. In the 1560s, there are several references to Woodcock Hammer or Forge being worked by Swanne. Woodcock Forge is believed to have been built by Jack Dancy of Turners Hill. Hedgecourt Mill is thought to have been remodelled by him about the same time. The pond at Hedgecourt acted as a storage for the Woodcock forge. The tilt hammer was operated by an overshot waterwheel. Another overshot waterwheel worked bellows. In 1574, John Thorpe of Hedgecourt was working the forge in connection with the furnace at Myllwood. in 1586 Thorpe bought property from William Swanne Sr in the Woodcock Forge area. From 1598 to 1606 the rent was paid by Thomas Thorpe, son of John and in 1629 the forge was leased by John Gage to Richard Thorpe, the son of Thomas. His son, also Richard, held the forge until 1651, when it was forfeit in lieu of a debt. Thorpe's interest in the forge was sold to Simon Everenden of Cliffe near Lewes. In the 1650s the forge was in the occupation of John Newnham. In 1664, the forge was lease by Jeremy Johnson Jr of Charlwood. In 1672, woodland next to the pond was referred to as \\"Hammerwood\\" also known as \\"Wire Wood\\" thus indicating a drawing mill. John Newnham died in 1707, and his wife died in 1719, but the forge was known as \\"Mr Johnson's Forge\\" in 1717. At that time the output from the forge was some per annum. By 1729 the forge was in the occupation of Thomas Stanford, who was converting sows from Heathfield furnace at Woodcock Forge. Stanford does not seem to have had any connections with the Wealden iron industry after 1738. In 1742 Samuel Baker was in occupation, followed by Edward Raby and Alexander Master in 1758. They were supplying the Board of Ordnance with several gauges of bar iron, staff iron and rolled plate. Raby & Master were bankrupt in 1764. Edward Raby died in 1771, and the forge was taken over by his son Alexander until 1774, when the Government forced him to give up Woodcock furnace in a wrangle over the size of his moulds. Joseph Wright and Thomas Pickett took the business, but it is thought that the Hammer Mill ceased to be used c.1787. In 1800, the name Wire Mill is first used. Daniel Fossick held Wire Mill from 1800 to 1816, when he died. The mill was sold to James Jenner, who converted it to a corn mill. Jenner was at Wire Mill until 1844, when he was succeeded by William Brand. In 1838 he was joined by John Saunders, the mill being known as Woodcock Mill then. Saunders left in 1840 to take Hedgecourt Mill and William Brand joined Jenner. Jenner died in 1844 and Thomas Brand took the mill, which was known as Wire Mill in 1851. At this time the mill had two overshot waterwheels and drove four pairs of millstones. In 1855 the mill lake covered . Thomas Brand was still running the mill in 1871, assisted by his son Thomas, John Holman and John Burfield, all described as millers in the census of that year. In 1881, Thomas Brand (son) was the miller at Wire Mill. He ran the mill until 1887/88 when David Dadswell took the mill. Wire Mill was sold in 1911, described as having two overshot waterwheels and the mill lake covered at this time. A picture of the mill c.1911 can be seen here. The mill was not sold and again offered for auction in 1912, again without success. A third attempt at auction in 1918 saw the mill being bought by a Major Crum. He sold it to a Miss Wilkins who had the building converted to residential use in 1920. The mill was purchased by the Women's Farm and Garden Union in 1922 and by 1929 was the Wire Mill Tea Gardens. By 1933 it was the Wire Mill Fishing Club and in 1948 the Wire Mill Hotel and Fishing Club. By 1962 the property was known as the Wiremill Lakeside Hotel, Country and Fishing Club. Over the next decade the Country Club grew in popularity, leading to complaints and the local council refused to renew the clubs music and dancing licence. In 1986 the mill was again sold, and although damaged by a fire during renovations reopened as a restaurant in September of that year. The mill was sold again in 1996 and 2000 and is now a pub. The building is devoid of machinery.Felbridge & District History Group Felbridge & District History Group =Lingfield Tannery= This tannery was water powered.

Leiter pitched 19 seasons in the Major League Baseball (MLB) for New York Yankees, Toronto Blue Jays, Florida Marlins and New York Mets. He is now a studio analyst for MLB Network, and formerly a color commentator for the YES Network and 2016 Marlins Fox Sports Florida game analyst. Career =Early career= Leiter was raised in a baseball-oriented family; all five of his brothers played the game. A native of Berkeley Township, New Jersey,Lieber, Jill. \\"Mets' Leiter delivers hope for others\\", USA Today, August 28, 2002. Accessed May 27, 2013. \\"He has pledged $1 million to Leiter's Landing, his charitable foundation that helps children in need, and has initiated a dozen or so projects in his hometown of Berkeley Township, N.J., as well as throughout New York City.\\" Leiter attended Central Regional High School, in the township's Bayville section. During one stretch in high school, he pitched consecutive no-hitters followed by a 32-strikeout game in 13 innings on April 19, 1984 (a game which he did not win). Leiter was selected for the Wilson First Team All-American team. In 2016, the NJSIAA named Leiter to the NJ High School Hall of Fame. =New York Yankees= Leiter was drafted by New York Yankees in 1984 MLB draft as a second round pick. Both he and his brother Mark became Yankees prospects. Leiter made his MLB debut as the starting pitcher for the Yankees on September 15, 1987, earning the win in a Yankees 4‚Äì3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at Yankee Stadium. Leiter has mentioned on a YES Network broadcast that early in his career with the Yankees, manager Billy Martin walked up to him and asked him why he was lifting weights. Leiter responded, \\"To strengthen my arm.\\" Billy was quoted as saying, \\"If you want to strengthen your arm, do some long toss.\\" In one of his final starts as a young player for the Yankees, manager Dallas Green left Leiter in to throw 162 pitches in a cold damp day in 1989. =Toronto Blue Jays= The Yankees traded him to the Toronto Blue Jays for outfielder Jesse Barfield on April 30, 1989. After being dealt to Toronto, the left-hander had arthroscopic surgery. He pitched in fewer than 20 innings for the Blue Jays from 1989 to 1992, because of the surgery, a pinched nerve in his elbow, tendinitis, and another arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder. His statistics during this period were a 5.17 ERA, IP, 14 H, 10 K, 11 BB, 1 HR, 1 GS, 0‚Äì0. He was, however, able to overcome the blisters problem with an exotic liniment (that he used throughout his career), and was still seen as a very promising prospect. Leiter finally got over his injury troubles in 1993, making 32 appearances (12 starts) for the Blue Jays. That year he appeared in 5 postseason games and even picked up a win in relief in Game One, and hit a double in Game Three of the 1993 World Series, as the Blue Jays went on to win their second consecutive World Championship. Leiter pitched effectively for the Blue Jays for the next two seasons before departing via free agency in 1996. =Florida Marlins= Following the 1995 season, Leiter left Toronto and signed with the Florida Marlins as a free agent. In his first season as a Marlin, Leiter made his first All-Star team, going 16‚Äì12 with a 2.93 ERA and 200 strikeouts. On May 11, 1996, he pitched a no-hitter against the Colorado Rockies, the first no-hitter in Marlins franchise history. Leiter was also selected to his first All Star game. The game was played at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia where he recorded the last out of a National League 6-0 win over the American League. The win was the last NL win for 13 years until 2010 when the National League won the All Star Classic in Anaheim. In 1997, Leiter won another World Series as the Marlins beat the Cleveland Indians. Leiter started Game 7 for the Marlins, pitching 6 innings and giving up two earned runs while being credited with a no decision. The Marlins would go on to win the game 3‚Äì2 in 11 innings to capture the championship. =New York Mets= Leiter with the Mets in 2004 In the following off-season, Leiter was traded to the New York Mets in part of the Marlins' fire sale where owner Wayne Huizenga traded away almost all of the team's higher priced players. In Leiter's first season as a Met, he reached a career high in wins going 17‚Äì6 and a career low in ERA finishing with a 2.47 ERA. In 1999, when the Mets were tied with the Cincinnati Reds for the National League Wild Card spot after 162 games, Leiter was the Mets starting pitcher in the \\"winner take all\\" one game playoff in Cinergy Field in Cincinnati. Leiter pitched a 2-hit complete game shutout to earn the win in the Mets 5‚Äì0 victory. The win put the Mets in the playoffs for the first time in 11 seasons. The Mets would go on to lose the 1999 National League Championship Series to the Atlanta Braves 4 games to 2. In 2000, Leiter made the All-Star team once again going 16‚Äì8 with a 3.20 ERA and 200 strikeouts. The Mets made the playoffs again in 2000 and this time reached the World Series. Leiter started Game 1 of the 2000 World Series at Yankee Stadium and Game 5 at Shea Stadium. Although he managed to achieve a 2.87 ERA and 16 strikeouts in innings, the Mets lost both games he started and eventually lost the World Series 4 games to 1. He was booed by Yankees fans when presented that year's Roberto Clemente Award prior to Game 2 of the World Series. Leiter was the second New York Met to be honored with the award. During the 2000 season, he pitched in the All Star game, and gave up a single to Derek Jeter. On April 30, 2002, Leiter became the first Major League pitcher to defeat all 30 teams, after beating the Arizona Diamondbacks 10‚Äì1.Caldera, Pete. \\"LEITER HAS BEATEN THEM ALL\\", The Record (Bergen County), May 2, 2002. Accessed August 26, 2008. \\"With the Mets' 10‚Äì1 victory Tuesday against the Diamondbacks, Leiter became the first man to ever defeat all 30 teams.\\" Leiter would pitch for the Mets until the end of the 2004 season. In his seven seasons in a Met uniform, all wearing number 22, he went 95‚Äì67 with a 3.42 ERA. At the time he left the Mets, he ranked highly on several Mets all-time lists including wins (6th), strikeouts (7th with 1106), innings pitched (7th with 1360.0), and games started (6th with 213). He was the Mets Opening Day starting pitcher in 1999, 2001, and 2002. In ten straight seasons, from 1995 to 2004, Leiter had at least 10 wins and at least a .500 record. =Second stint with Marlins= Following the 2004 season, the Mets declined Leiter's US$10 million option for 2005, making him a free agent. His former team, the Marlins, signed Leiter to a one-year, $8 million contract on December 8, 2004. Leiter struggled during his return to the Marlins. He walked more batters than usual (60 in 80 innings, in addition to 88 hits). In 17 appearances (16 starts), he had a 3‚Äì7 record and a 6.64 ERA, and he took much criticism for the Marlins' first-half struggles in 2005 (they were 7 games behind the surprising Washington Nationals at the All-Star break). He was demoted to the bullpen in late June, but he returned to the rotation after an injury to Josh Beckett. On July 10, when the Marlins played their last game before the three-day All-Star break, he gave up six runs in three-plus innings. On July 14, 2005, the Florida Marlins designated Leiter for assignment. =Second stint with Yankees= On July 15, 2005, Leiter was acquired by the New York Yankees, who had four starting pitchers on the disabled list, for a player to be named later. His first start as a Yankee since April 26, 1989, came on July 17, 2005, against the division-leading Boston Red Sox. Leiter won the game, pitching 6 innings, allowing one run and three hits, and striking out eight. After several starts with mixed success, he informed Joe Torre that he would be willing to pitch out of the bullpen, where he would stay for the latter part of the season, yielding his starting slot to Aaron Small. Leiter worked out of the bullpen in the 2005 American League Division Series pitching in four of the five games between the Yankees and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. The Angels won the series 3 games to 2. In his final official appearance in a Major League uniform, Leiter earned a win, pitching 2/3 scoreless innings in Game 4 at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees won the game 3‚Äì2. Leiter signed a minor league contract with the Yankees in 2006; however, he stated he would likely retire. The primary reason he spent part of spring training with the Yankees was to keep in shape for the World Baseball Classic. After the United States team was eliminated from the World Baseball Classic, he officially retired in an interview on YES, after a Yankees spring training victory versus the Indians where Leiter pitched 1/3 of an inning. Broadcasting career Al Leiter has worked in the television broadcast booth for FOX during the playoffs for several seasons, mainly to provide in-depth analysis of various pitchers. Worked the post season for ESPN as studio analyst in 1998 and 1999. While still playing for the NY Mets, his first opportunity as a color analyst for FOX Sports was in 2003 NLCS Chicago Cubs Vs. Florida Marlins. The Marlins went on to win the World Series that year beating the Yankees. Leiter worked as an analyst alongside Tom Brenaman and Steve Lyons. The following year, Leiter was in the booth with Joe Buck and Tim McCarver for the Boston Red Sox Vs. NY Yankees in the ALCS. Since 2006, Leiter has worked as a color commentator and a studio analyst for the YES Network. He won a NY Emmy in 2007 for the \\"Manny game\\" in Boston. In 2009, Leiter was hired by MLB Network and appeared on the very first show the Network produced on January 1, 2009. He became a studio analyst for MLB Network in addition to his commentating job for the YES Network. In 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015 he received a National Sports Emmy Award Nomination for Studio Analyst. In 2012, 2014, and 2016 he received the Sports Emmy for Outstanding Studio Show-Daily MLB Tonight Segment Producer. He also worked select games for the Miami Marlins on Fox Sports Florida in 2016. In 2016, he won the NY Sports Emmy for game analyst for the YES Network.http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/mlb/miami- marlins/article60172931.html / Leiter broadcasting a game. On March 3rd, 2019, he was named a baseball operations advisor for the Mets. Leiter will focus on scouting and player development with an emphasis on mental preparation for pitchers, working with players at every level of the organization, from newly drafted players to Major Leaguers. Charitable work Leiter has won nearly every philanthropic award MLB offers, including the 2000 Roberto Clemente Award. He also won the Branch Rickey Award in 1999.  Political activities  Leiter has expressed interest in running for political office as a Republican in his home state of New Jersey. He served as a member of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's transition team. Leiter was appointed as a member to the New Jersey Sports, Gaming, and Entertainment Committee. Governor Christie nominated/appointed him for the New Jersey Hall of Fame Commission.  Personal life  Leiter is of Austrian, Czech and British descent.Leiter entry , Business Wire. Accessed June 22, 2015. He and his wife Lori have four children: Lindsay Brooke, Carly Jayne, Jack Thomas, and Katelyn Grace. In 2017, as a high school sophomore, his son Jack verbally committed to play college baseball for the Vanderbilt Commodores. His season was highlighted with a 15 strikeout, no-hitter. His brother, Mark Leiter, pitched 11 seasons in the Majors. Another brother, Kurt, played in the Baltimore Orioles organization and reached as high as Double-A. His nephew, Mark Leiter Jr., is a pitcher for the Arizona Diamondbacks.

Department of Transportation, New Hampshire's seacoast region (in lighter blue) lies at the southeastern corner of the state. The Seacoast Region is the southeast area of the U.S. state of New Hampshire that includes the eastern portion of Rockingham County and the southern portion of Strafford County. The region stretches along the Atlantic Ocean from New Hampshire's border with Salisbury, Massachusetts, to the Piscataqua River and New Hampshire's border with Kittery, Maine. The shoreline alternates between rocky and rough headlands and areas with sandy beaches. Some of the beaches are bordered by jetties or groins, particularly in the towns of Rye and Hampton. The Seacoast Region includes some inland towns as well, as far west as Epping and as far north as Rochester. The city of Portsmouth is the cultural and commercial hub of the region, with numerous historical landmarks and tourist attractions including Strawbery Banke, the Moffatt-Ladd House, and the John Paul Jones House. Dover in Strafford County is the largest city in the region by population and is the oldest permanent settlement in New Hampshire. Dover is home to the Children's Museum of New HampshireChildren's Museum of New Hampshire and the renowned Woodman Institute Museum. The Seacoast Region was the first area of the state to be permanently settled by Europeans in the early 17th century.

D1 and D2 are alternative positions of the demand curve, S is the supply curve, and P and Q are price and quantity respectively. The shift from D1 to D2 means an increase in demand with consequences for the other variables In economics, a demand curve is a graph depicting the relationship between the price of a certain commodity (the y-axis) and the quantity of that commodity that is demanded at that price (the x-axis). Demand curves may be used to model the price-quantity relationship for an individual consumer (an individual demand curve), or more commonly for all consumers in a particular market (a market demand curve). It is generally assumed that demand curves are downward-sloping, as shown in the adjacent image. This is because of the law of demand: for most goods, the quantity demanded will decrease in response to an increase in price, and will increase in response to a decrease in price. Demand curves are used to estimate behaviors in competitive markets, and are often combined with supply curves to estimate the equilibrium price (the price at which sellers together are willing to sell the same amount as buyers together are willing to buy, also known as market clearing price) and the equilibrium quantity (the amount of that good or service that will be produced and bought without surplus/excess supply or shortage/excess demand) of that market. In a monopolistic market, the demand curve facing the monopolist is simply the market demand curve. Movement along the Demand Curve is when the commodity experience change in both the quantity demanded and price, causing the curve to move in a specific direction. The shift in the demand curve is when, the price of the commodity remains constant, but there is a change in quantity demanded due to some other factors, causing the curve to shift to a particular side. Demand curves are usually considered as theoretical structures that are expected to exist in the real world, but real world measurements of actual demand curves are difficult and rare. Shape of the demand curve Demand curves are often graphed as straight lines, where a and b are parameters: :Q = a+bP\\\\text{ where }b<0. The constant a embodies the effects of all factors other than price that affect demand. If income were to change, for example, the effect of the change would be represented by a change in the value of \\"a\\" and be reflected graphically as a shift of the demand curve. The constant b is the slope of the demand curve and shows how the price of the good affects the quantity demanded. The graph of the demand curve uses the inverse demand function in which price is expressed as a function of quantity. The standard form of the demand equation can be converted to the inverse equation by solving for P: :P = \\\\frac{Q}{b} - \\\\frac{a}{b}. Shift of a demand curve The shift of a demand curve takes place when there is a change in any non-price determinant of demand, resulting in a new demand curve. Non-price determinants of demand are those things that will cause demand to change even if prices remain the same--in other words, the things whose changes might cause a consumer to buy more or less of a good even if the good's own price remained unchanged. Some of the more important factors are the prices of related goods (both substitutes and complements), income, population, and expectations. However, demand is the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a good under the prevailing circumstances; so, any circumstance that affects the consumer's willingness or ability to buy the good or service in question can be a non-price determinant of demand. As an example, weather could be a factor in the demand for beer at a baseball game. When income increases, the demand curve for normal goods shifts outward as more will be demanded at all prices, while the demand curve for inferior goods shifts inward due to the increased attainability of superior substitutes. With respect to related goods, when the price of a good (e.g. a hamburger) rises, the demand curve for substitute goods (e.g. chicken) shifts out, while the demand curve for complementary goods (e.g. ketchup) shifts in (i.e. there is more demand for substitute goods as they become more attractive in terms of value for money, while demand for complementary goods contracts in response to the contraction of quantity demanded of the underlying good). =Factors affecting individual demand= * Changes in the prices of related goods (substitutes and complements) * Changes in disposable income, the magnitude of the shift also being related to the income elasticity of demand. * Changes in tastes and preferences. Tastes and preferences are assumed to be fixed in the short-run. This assumption of fixed preferences is a necessary condition for aggregation of individual demand curves to derive market demand. * Changes in expectations. =Factors affecting market demand= In addition to the factors which can affect individual demand there are three factors that can cause the market demand curve to shift: * a change in the number of consumers, * a change in the distribution of tastes among consumers, * a change in the distribution of income among consumers with different tastes. Some circumstances which can cause the demand curve to shift in include: *Decrease in price of a substitute *Increase in price of a complement *Decrease in income if good is normal good *Increase in income if good is inferior good Movement along a demand curve There is movement along a demand curve when a change in price causes the quantity demanded to change. It is important to distinguish between movement along a demand curve, and a shift in a demand curve. Movements along a demand curve happen only when the price of the good changes.Underwood, Instructor's Manual, Microeconomics 5th ed. (Prentice-Hall 2001) at 5. When a non-price determinant of demand changes, the curve shifts. These \\"other variables\\" are part of the demand function. They are \\"merely lumped into intercept term of a simple linear demand function.\\" Thus a change in a non-price determinant of demand is reflected in a change in the x-intercept causing the curve to shift along the x axis.The x intercept is affected because the standard diagram uses the inverse demand function Price elasticity of demand (PED) PED is a measure of the sensitivity of the quantity variable, Q, to changes in the price variable, P. Elasticity answers the question of how much the quantity will change in percentage terms for a 1% change in the price, and is thus important in determining how revenue will change. PED is negative because of the inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of the good demanded, a consequence of the law of demand. The elasticity of demand indicates how sensitive the demand for a good is to a price change. If the absolute value of PED is between zero and 1, demand is said to be inelastic; if the absolute value of PED equals 1, the demand is unitary elastic; and if the absolute value of Price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, demand is elastic. A low coefficient implies that changes in price have little influence on demand. A high elasticity indicates that consumers will respond to a price rise by buying a lot less of the good and that consumers will respond to a price cut by buying a lot more... Taxes and subsidies A sales tax on the commodity does not directly change the demand curve, if the price axis in the graph represents the price including tax. Similarly, a subsidy on the commodity does not directly change the demand curve, if the price axis in the graph represents the price after deduction of the subsidy. If the price axis in the graph represents the price before addition of tax and/or subtraction of subsidy then the demand curve moves inward when a tax is introduced, and outward when a subsidy is introduced.

Most often associated with the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), the term is also used more generically in contexts such as in OSI/ISO Network management model. While intended to refer to the complete collection of management information available on an entity, it is often used to refer to a particular subset, more correctly referred to as MIB-module. Objects in the MIB are defined using a subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) called \\"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)\\" . The software that performs the parsing is a MIB compiler. The database is hierarchical (tree-structured) and each entry is addressed through an object identifier (OID). Internet documentation RFCs discuss MIBs, notably , \\"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP based internets\\", and its two companions, , \\"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets\\", and , \\"A Simple Network Management Protocol\\". Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a standard and flexible notation that describes data structures for representing, encoding, transmitting, and decoding data. It provides a set of formal rules for describing the structure of objects that are independent of machine-specific encoding techniques and is a precise, formal notation that removes ambiguities. ASN.1 is a joint ISO and ITU-T standard, originally defined in 1984 as part of CCITT X.409:1984. ASN.1 moved to its own standard, X.208, in 1988 due to its broader applicability. The substantially revised 1995 version is covered by the X.680 standards series. An adapted subset of ASN.1, Structure of Management Information (SMI), is specified for use in SNMP to define sets of related MIB objects; these sets are termed MIB modules. MIB hierarchy The MIB hierarchy can be depicted as a tree with a nameless root, the levels of which are assigned by different organizations. The top-level MIB OIDs belong to different standards organizations, while lower-level object IDs are allocated by associated organizations. This model permits management across all layers of the OSI reference model, extending into applications such as databases, email, and the Java reference model, as MIBs can be defined for all such area-specific information and operations. A managed object (sometimes called a MIB object or object) is one of any number of specific characteristics of a managed device. Managed objects are made up of one or more object instances, which are essentially variables. An OID uniquely identifies a managed object in the MIB hierarchy. Two types of managed objects exist: *Scalar objects define a single object instance. *Tabular objects define multiple related object instances that are grouped in MIB tables. An example of a managed object is \`atInput\`, which is a scalar object that contains a single object instance, the integer value that indicates the total number of input AppleTalk packets on a router interface. =SNMPv1 and SMI-specific data types= The first version of the Structure of Management Information (SMIv1) specifies the use of a number of SMI-specific data types, which are divided into two categories: simple data types and application-wide data types. Simple data types Three simple data types are defined in the SNMPv1 SMI: * The integer data type is a signed integer in the range of ‚àí231 to 231‚àí1. * Octet strings are ordered sequences of 0 to 65,535 octets. * Object IDs representation of object identifiers allocated according to the rules specified in ASN.1. Application-wide data types The following application-wide data types exist in the SNMPv1 SMI: *Network addresses represent addresses from a particular protocol family. SMIv1 supports only 32-bit (IPv4) addresses (SMIv2 uses Octet Strings to represent addresses generically, and thus are usable in SMIv1 too. SMIv1 had an explicit IPv4 address datatype.) *Counters are non-negative integers that increase until they reach a maximum value and then roll over to zero. SNMPv1 specifies a counter size of 32 bits. *Gauges are non-negative integers that can increase or decrease between specified minimum and maximum values. Whenever the system property represented by the gauge is outside of that range, the value of the gauge itself will vary no further than the respective maximum or minimum, as specified in . *Time ticks represent time since some event, measured in hundredths of a second. *Opaques represent an arbitrary encoding that is used to pass arbitrary information strings that do not conform to the strict data typing used by the SMI. *Integers represent signed integer-valued information. This data type redefines the integer data type, which has arbitrary precision in ASN.1 but bounded precision in the SMI. *Unsigned integers represent unsigned integer-valued information, which is useful when values are always non-negative. This data type redefines the integer data type, which has arbitrary precision in ASN.1 but bounded precision in the SMI. =SNMPv1 MIB tables= The SNMPv1 SMI defines highly structured tables that are used to group the instances of a tabular object (that is, an object that contains multiple variables). Tables are composed of zero or more rows, which are indexed in a way that allows SNMP to retrieve or alter an entire row with a single \`Get\`, \`GetNext\`, or \`Set\` command. =SMIv2 and structure of management information= The second version of the SMI (SMIv2) is described in and . It enhances and adds to the SMIv1-specific data types, such as including bit strings, network addresses, and counters. Bit strings are defined only in SMIv2 and comprise zero or more named bits that specify a value. Network addresses represent an address from a particular protocol family. Counters are non-negative integers that increase until they reach a maximum value and then return to zero. In SMIv1, a 32-bit counter size is specified. In SMIv2, 32-bit and 64-bit counters are defined. SMIv2 also specifies information modules, which specify a group of related definitions. Three types of SMI information modules exist: MIB modules, compliance statements, and capability statements. * MIB modules contain definitions of interrelated managed objects. * Compliance statements provide a systematic way to describe a group of managed objects that must be implemented for conformance to a standard. * Capability statements are used to indicate the precise level of support that an agent claims with respect to a MIB group. An NMS can adjust its behavior toward agents according to the capabilities statements associated with each agent.  Updating MIB modules  MIB modules are occasionally updated to add new functionality, remove ambiguities and to fix defects. These changes are made in conformance to section 10 of and section 5 of . An example of a MIB module that has been updated many times is the important set of objects that was originally defined in , also known as \\"MIB-II\\".

In the 1960s and 1970s, he directed many critically acclaimed avant-garde films of various genres. Today, he is mainly known for his later work in the erotic genre, with films such as Caligula, Cos√¨ fan tutte (released under the English title All Ladies Do It), Paprika, Monella (Frivolous Lola) and Trasgredire. Career =Avant-garde cinema= In the 1960s and 1970s Brass was considered a promising experimental and avant-garde director, and his debut film Who Works Is Lost got very favorable reviews after screening at Venice Film Festival 1963.A definite new talent. Gene Moskowitz, \\"Few 'Quality' at Venice: Emphasis on Art via Austerity\\". In: Variety, 11 September 1963, S. 5. Scan found at: In 1964, he was commissioned by Umberto Eco to create two short films experimenting with visual language for the 13th Triennale di Milano ‚Äì Tempo Libero and Tempo Lavorativo.Article about Tempo Libero and Tempo Lavorativo Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, Brass directed films in many genres, including western (Yankee) and crime (Col cuore in gola), all using a very experimental editing- and camera-style. In 1968, Paramount Pictures offered Brass the job of directing A Clockwork Orange, which did not happen due to scheduling conflicts.Tinto Brass: Audio-commentary on the Cult Epics DVD of \\"Deadly Sweet\\" (\\"Col Cuore in Gola\\") DVD075 In an article about the filming of Dropout from 1970, he was called the \\"Antonioni of the 70s\\".Sally K.

List of awards that were awarded at the 1971 event. In 1972, Brass was a member of the jury at the 22nd Berlin International Film Festival. =Erotic cinema= After Salon Kitty and Caligula, the style of his films gradually changed towards erotic films. Caligula was originally supposed to be a satire on power instead of an erotic film, but the producers changed and re-edited the film entirely without Brass's consent, removing many political and comical scenes, and re-shooting pornographic ones, to make the film a pornographic drama. The director demanded that his name be stricken from the credits, and he is only credited for \\"Principal Photography\\". Despite this, the film remains his most widely viewed work (and the highest-grossing Italian film released in the United States). Other notable works of Brass's later period include The Key and Senso '45. He was making films into his seventies.Evolver, \\"First, I check out the butt\\" Brass interview on the occasion of his 75th birthday, May 2008 =Style= Brass' films since his early works follow an impressionistic style ‚Äì they tend not to show immense landscapes, but bits and pieces of the scenery and peripheral characters and objects through pans and zooms, thus imitating how the viewer might see the events if he were actually present. This also gives the films an extraordinarily rapid pace. He often uses a television-like multicam method of shooting, with at least three cameras running at once, each focusing on something different. There are many other directorial trademarks throughout his films. From 1976's Salon Kitty onwards, mirrors play a large part in the set design. Sometimes he even goes as far as to begin a scene with a mirror shot, then pan over to the action being reflected, giving a disorienting feeling. His erotic films ‚Äì especially The Key, Miranda and All Ladies Do It ‚Äì often accentuate women's ample buttocks and pubic hair as well as underarm hair. Brass' films in the 1980s and early 1990s had mainly been adaptations of famous literary works usually in the erotic genre, namely The Key (La chiave), The Mistress of the Inn (Miranda), the novel Le lettere da Capri by Mario Soldati (Capriccio), the novel Snack Bar Budapest by Marco Lodoli and Silvia Bre (eponymous), Fanny Hill (Paprika), and the novel L'uomo che guarda by Alberto Moravia (The Voyeur), while 2002 film Senso '45 is an adaptation of Senso, previously filmed by Luchino Visconti. Many of Brass' works qualify as period drama set during World War II (Salon Kitty and Senso '45, set in Berlin and Asolo respectively), in postbellum Italy (Miranda and Capriccio), antebellum Italy (The Key), and in 1950s Italy (Paprika and Monella). Brass almost always works in a cameo for his friend Osiride Pevarello and himself as well. He was also featured as the presenter in the direct-to-video erotic short films compilation Tinto Brass presenta Corti Circuiti Erotici released in four volumes in 1999. Personal life His nickname Tintoretto (later shortened to Tinto) was given by his grandfather Italico Brass, a renowned Gorizian painter. Brass was married to Carla Cipriani (\\"Tinta\\"), from 1957 until her death in 2006. Carla was the daughter of Harry's Bar founder Giuseppe Cipriani, who managed the restaurant Locanda Cipriani on the Venetian island of Torcello and also collaborated as a screenwriter in Brass's films. The couple had a daughter, Beatrice, and a son, Bonifacio. Brass is politically affiliated with Italian Radicals. On Sunday, 18 April 2010, he suffered an intracranial hemorrhage. Retrospectives In 2012, Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival did a retrospective on Brass' early 1960s and 1970s films, screening newly restored versions. The restorations were done in collaboration with Alexander Tuschinski, who in recent years researched Brass' 1960s/1970s works and has been called \\"the foremost scholastic authority on Tinto Brass\\".

In 1976 it took the name Socialist Party of Andalusia (). In 1979 the name was changed to Socialist Party of Andalusia - Andalusian Party (). The PA party name was adopted in 1984. Its last Secretary-General was Antonio Jes√∫s Ruiz. A splinter group, led by former leader Pedro Pacheco, was formed in 2001, under the name Socialist Party of Andalusia (), later rejoined back into Partido Andalucista. Historically, the party had been strong in the capital city of Andalusia, Seville, as well as other big cities like Jerez de la Frontera or Algeciras, obtaining the cities' mayorship in several times in all three cities. At their 17th Congress on 12 September 2015, the party dissolved. Ideology The Andalusian Party declared itself ideologically as an Andalusian, federalist and progressive nationalist political organization. Its main motivation is the extension and maintenance of Andalusian autonomy, fighting against a \\"conformist attitude\\" and defending the cultural identity of Andalusia. The PA declared itself as a political organization that defended the interests of the Andalusian people and sought to obtain equality before other peoples of Spain. This means that from the PA they considered Andalusia as a nation with its own cultural identity, a condition that has been accommodated until today in article 2 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978, and which was conquered as in no other Spanish territory, starting from the ratification of autonomy and the Statute in a referendum. Therefore, they defended this political and legal fact in those institutions and organizations in which they were present. The PA also declared itself as a progressive organization, referring only to an option committed to an autonomous and sustainable socio-economic development of Andalusia, innovative and empowered to generate initiatives, and in this way, overcome the territorial and social imbalances within and dependency and inequality with respect to other peoples, rejecting the current role assigned to the autonomous community as a provider of resources and low-skilled labor. The PA was called federalist, because it supported a model of political organization that surpassed the State of the Autonomies and that advanced towards a federal State in Spain. It declared itself, finally, of the left, when it declared that there was an indisputable priority for the construction of a more just and egalitarian society, open and tolerant, peaceful and supportive, that guarantees the conservation of the cultural and natural heritage that identifies the community so that be enjoyed by the next generations, as well as a level and quality of life that allows maximum happiness and well-being to the Andalusian people.

It is so named because it follows the course of the River Taff. Along much of its length, it follows the National Cycle Network Route 8 (L√¥n Las Cymru) that continues to Holyhead, and is substantially off-road. History The trail was launched in September 1988 by Sir Wyn Roberts, Minister of State for the Welsh Office. The project was initiated and co-ordinated by the Merthyr and Cynon Groundwork Trust, with the co-operation of the local councils through whose areas the trail passes. Financial and logistical support was given by the Welsh Development Agency and by Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity. Before the trail, there were several similar but disconnected routes in the area. Taff Ely borough council had created cycling routes within its boundaries, Cardiff city council had provided the Three Castles Cycle Route from Caerphilly into Cardiff, and the Brecon Beacons National Park was developing leisure trails to encourage the use of the park. The Groundwork Trust for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf saw a need for the co-ordination of these efforts, and the Taff Trail was born. In more recent times, there have been criticisms of the Taff Trail, both for being almost universally shared with pedestrians whenever it is segregated, and for being too narrow. Crashes have occurred along much of the Trail, with Cardiff Council promising to widen much of the route in their local area. The route The trail makes much use of an abandoned branch of the Taff Vale Railway and of the Glamorganshire Canal. These had been built in the 18th and 19th centuries to transport coal and iron ore from Merthyr Tydfil, the Cynon Valley and the Rhondda valley to the docks at Cardiff and Barry. The canals had become disused due to competition from the railways, and the railways in turn had become surplus to requirements as the heavy industries upon which they depended had been wound down. These routes, which although disused had remained largely intact, proved ideal for the needs of the trail, providing a convenient path along the narrow Taff valley. =Cardiff= The start of the Taff Trail, inside The Celtic Ring sculpture. The trail begins in Roald Dahl Plass in Cardiff Bay, at a sculpture named The Celtic Ring, created especially for the trail by Harvey Hood . Travelling west, it crosses the Taff and follows the river north through the centre of Cardiff along the Taff Embankment. It passes within of Cardiff Central railway station and of the Millennium Stadium in the city centre, before winding through Sophia Gardens, passing the home of Glamorgan County Cricket Club. The trail continues along the Taff through Bute Park and Pontcanna Fields, near Llandaff Fields, and crosses the pedestrian bridge at Blackweir. It then follows the eastern bank of the Taff past Blackweir Lodge, under the A48 road flyover, past Llandaff Weir (Llandaff Rowing Club is visible on the opposite bank) near Howell's School, Llandaff Cathedral and the BBC Wales studios, and through Hailey Park in Llandaff North. In this area (as with most of the path within Cardiff Council boundaries) pedestrians have been given priority, despite the national cycle route status of the trail. Especially on fair weather days, cyclists must proceed slowly due to pedestrian congestion and dog walkers. It then moves inland for a short distance, before rejoining the river back close to Forest Farm, and continues along the river past Radyr Weir and under the M4 motorway. =Tongwynlais= After passing underneath the A470 dual carriageway, the Trail reaches the village of Tongwynlais. As well as shops, pubs, a caf√©, and a cycle shop, it is home to the Gothic fantasy castle, Castell Coch. At Tongwynlais, the trail splits into two. The high-level route climbs the steep hill to Castell Coch, then up a very steep path (best avoided in muddy conditions), and along a forest track of sharp stones. The low-level route is tarmacked and runs below the castle, adjacent to Taff's Well railway station and then climbs steadily for along the former Rhymney Railway, until it rejoins the high-level route just before the Nantgarw bypass. Here the route turns left off the main path - an easy turn to miss - and crosses the bypass, joining National Cycle Network Route 4 (known in Wales as the Celtic Trail). Route 4 stretches from London in the east to St David's in the west, and runs along with the Taff Trail as far as Pontypridd. =Pontypridd= The Taff Trail north of Pontypridd The trail proceeds along the former Alexandra (Newport Docks) Docks & Railway Company line towards Rhydyfelin. At Rhydyfelin, the Trail emerges briefly to cross a minor road, before continuing through the Glyntaff Farm housing estate and passing along the length of Glyntaff Cemetery. Wooden sign marking the Taff Trail Rhydyfelin. After the cemetery, the Trail joins Cilfynydd Road. The former route continued along the road for half a mile, before leading into the northern end of Pontypridd town centre. However, the trail is now signposted to cross a pedestrian bridge and pass through Ynysangharad Park. At the northern exit from the park, users may wish to take a short (50 yards) detour to visit the Old Bridge in Pontypridd. Cyclists may wish to use the bike locks outside the cafe promenade opposite the Northern exit of the park. =Abercynon= The Trail continues north-west on-road through Trallwng, before becoming traffic-free for a stretch, rejoining the Taff along the way. North of Cilfynydd, a permissive path alongside the Taff has been opened to avoid the previous road route between Cilfynydd and Abercynon. At Abercynon, the Trail follows the route of the Merthyr Tramroad, used by Richard Trevithick's Penydarren steam locomotive. This stretch has been recently upgraded, but the original stone tramroad sleepers can be seen at the side of the gravel track. =Aberfan= The bridge at Pontygwaith At Pontygwaith, the Trail climbs steeply above the A470 by means of some steps. It then follows above the A470 as far as Aberfan, where it descends below the road and continues through the mainly residential areas of Aberfan. At this point, it passes the cemetery containing the memorial to the children and teachers who died in the Aberfan disaster. The stretch from Pontygwaith to Merthyr Tydfil follows the route of the former Glamorganshire Canal. =Merthyr Tydfil= After Aberfan, the trail passes through Troedyrhiw and Abercanaid, before reaching Merthyr Tydfil at the Rhydycar Leisure Centre. From this point, the town centre is around away over the Taff. It is very easy to get lost in Merthyr, and travellers may find it easier to ignore the Route 8 signs, and follow their road map instead. =Brecon= From Merthyr, the trail continues across Cefn Coed Viaduct, through Cefn-coed-y-cymmer, then follows the Taf Fechan (the smaller of the two main tributaries of the River Taff) past Pontsticill Reservoir. From Pontsticill to Brecon is about of remote scenery crossing the Brecon Beacons mountains - partly pretty forest tracks and partly wide open, expansive moorland. There are very steep roads on both sides of the mountain. Descending the mountain, cyclists can avoid the slow rough track on the east side of Talybont Reservoir by taking the road along the west bank, on which traffic is normally very sparse. The route continues along the trackbed of the former Brecon and Merthyr Railway to Talybont-on-Usk, then towards Brecon , in the last few kilometres following alongside the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal. A second route exists - also called the Taff Trail - from Cefn Coed to Brecon along the Taf Fawr (more or less parallel to the A470 road, but often on the opposite side of the valley) via the Garwnant Visitors Centre. This route is most suitable for walking and horse-riding. Although cycling (pref. mountain bike) is possible in places, it is not nearly so well sign-posted as the Taf Fechan route.

There had been a noticeable literary group in Cairo before the war in North Africa broke out, including university academics. Possibly as a reflection of that, there were two strands of literary activity and publication during the years 1942‚Äì1944. There was the Personal Landscape group centred on the publication of that name, founded by Lawrence Durrell, Robin Fedden and Bernard Spencer. There was also the Salamander group, which produced a magazine and the Oasis series of anthologies. To oversimplify, the first group produced poetic reputations, while the second, founded by servicemen, broadcast appeals and collected an archive of 17,000 poems written at the period. Poets such as Terence Tiller and G. S. Fraser had a foot in both camps. Keith Douglas, the iconic war poet, was associated with the Personal Landscape group. Alan Rook, John Gawsworth and John Waller published in Salamander. Several of the Cairo poets appeared in the 'Poets in Uniform' issue of Tambimuttu's Poetry London early in 1941.

With 152 professional wins and 211 wins in his career, he is considered by some to be one of the greatest German cyclists and cycling sprinters of all-time. Zabel won a record nine points classifications in grands tours including the points classification in the Tour de France six consecutive years between 1996 and 2001 and the points classification in the Vuelta a Espa√±a in 2002, 2003 and 2004. Zabel won the Milan‚ÄìSan Remo four times and numerous six-day track events. He was one of the few road cyclists of recent times who raced all year, including track cycling in winter. For season 2012 he joined as sprint coach. He previously held that same position with the team until their dissolution. Zabel admitted to doping from 1996 to 2004. Early life and amateur career Zabel (left) applauding for Frank Seeland Zabel grew up in East Berlin, in the borough Marzahn. His father Detlev was a professional cyclist. His first international success as a junior was at the track world championship when he was third in the team pursuit on the East German team. In 1988 he was fifth in the points race. In 1989, as a 19-year-old, he was included in the East German national track team for professionals. That year he became national champion of East Germany in the individual pursuit. After the Fall of the Berlin Wall he moved to Dortmund and became part of the amateur team RC Olympia Dortmund, led by Hennes Junkermann. He was second at the first national road championship of re- unified Germany in 1991, first at the regional championship of North Rhine- Westphalia and was included in the amateur German team for the World Championship in August. In 1992 he made name as a strong sprinter, winning the green jersey in the Peace Race and taking several stage wins in stage races. In July he was fourth in the road race of the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, where he won the sprint of the peloton. Professional career =1993‚Äì1995: The early years= In late 1992 he turned professional with the small German team Union-Frondenberg, before changing in 1993 to Team Telekom where he further developed as a sprinter. On 27 April 1994 Zabel tested positive for clostebol metabolites in Veenendaal-Veenendaal. He was fined 3000 Swiss francs and lost 50 points. A suspension on probation was cancelled. Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 21 September 1997, Later that year he won Paris‚ÄìTours in a mass sprint, his first win in a classic race. In 1995 he won two stages on the Tour de France, his first success on a grand tour. =1996‚Äì1999: Green jerseys and classics victories= Zabel during Paris‚ÄìTours 2002 In 1996 he won again two stages in the Tour de France and won the points classification. He took over the green jersey in the 10th stage and wore it until the end of the Tour. That year his Telekom team took first and second place in the general classification as well, with Bjarne Riis and Jan Ullrich respectively. In 1997 Zabel won his first monument classic, Milan‚ÄìSan Remo. He was the only sprinter in a group of forty to make it to the finish and easily won the sprint. Later that year, he won three stages on the Tour de France and secured his second green jersey. In 1998 he won Milan‚ÄìSan Remo a second time and became national road champion of Germany. He won his third green jersey in the Tour de France, however this time without a stage victory. In 1999 he was second in Milan‚ÄìSan Remo, winning the peloton sprint behind Andrei Tchmil who had broken clear in the final kilometer and managed to maintain his effort. He won the important German semi-classic Rund um den Henninger Turm in Frankfurt and won his fourth consecutive green jersey, equalling Sean Kelly's record, again without winning a stage. =2000‚Äì2002: World number one= In 2000 he won two legs of the UCI Road World Cup in spring: Milan‚ÄìSan Remo a third time and a surprise win in the Amstel Gold Race, beating Michael Boogerd in a bunch sprint. In the summer he won an unprecedented fifth green jersey, thereby surpassing Kelly's previous record. At the end of the year, he was the best overall in the World Cup and number two on UCI World Ranking. In 2001 he won Milan-Sanremo a fourth time, the most since cycling legend Eddy Merckx, earning him the nickname Signore Milano-Sanremo in Italy. He won the points classification in the Tour de France a sixth consecutive time, winning three stages furthermore. Zabel's unique streak of six green jerseys was owed to his all-round ability: he was one of the strongest sprinters, but could also climb reasonably well. This meant that, apart from taking the lead in the general classification in the Tour de France thanks to time bonuses, he could pick up further victories when other sprinters had retired and take the green jersey (as symbol for the leader of the points classification) to Paris. One memorable victory in securing the green jersey was in the 2001 Tour de France, when his competition with Australian Stuart O'Grady lasted from the first week until the final stage in Paris, where Zabel's better placing took the green jersey off O'Grady's shoulders. Later that summer, he also won the HEW Cyclassics, Germany's biggest one-day classic, and his seventh World Cup race. In September he won three stages, consecutive, in the Vuelta a Espa√±a and was fifth in the World Championship road race in Lisbon. 2001 turned out to be his most successful year ever. At the end of the year, he had won 29 races and was number one on the closing standings of the world ranking. In 2002 he missed the breakaway in Milan‚ÄìSan Remo but won Rund um den Henninger Turm a second time. In the summer, he failed to win a seventh consecutive green jersey in the Tour de France. He won one stage victory, his twelfth in total, but was ultimately beaten by Australian Robbie McEwen in the final points classification. He won the points classification in the Vuelta a Espa√±a instead, without winning a stage. In Zolder, in Belgium, he finished third at the World championship in a peloton sprint behind Mario Cipollini and Robbie McEwen. At the end of the year, he maintained his number one position on the world ranking. =2003‚Äì2005: Vuelta success and podium places= Zabel in the national road championship, 2004 In 2003 he became national road champion of Germany for a second time, but failed to win a stage in the Tour de France and was third in the final points classification. He won two stages in the Vuelta and again won the points classification of the race. In October he won Paris‚ÄìTours for the second time in his career and was awarded the unofficial Ruban Jaune for winning the race in a record average speed for a one-day race of 47.55 km per hour. The record stood until 2010 when √ìscar Freire won Paris‚ÄìTours riding at an average of speed of 47.73 km per hour.Cyclingnews.com Gives details of 2010 edition of Paris‚ÄìTours. He ended the year as number two on the world ranking behind Paolo Bettini. In 2004 Zabel began the season losing what would have been his fifth Milan‚ÄìSan Remo. He looked secure to win the sprint, but lifted his arms to celebrate too early and was ultimately foiled by √ìscar Freire. He was third in the points classification of the Tour de France and first in the Vuelta points classification, but despite numerous second and third places, he didn't win a stage. His first place in the Vuelta was also his ninth win in a points classification of a grand tour, an all-time record. At the 2004 Olympics in Athens, he was again fourth in the road race, again winning the sprint behind three escapees and so missing an olympic medal twelve years after Barcelona. In October, after 9 victories and 18 second places throughout the season, he ended the year as he had begun it: second behind Freire, this time in the world championship in Verona. In 2005 Zabel became the first to win Rund um den Henninger-Turm in Frankfurt a third time, in his first win on the season. In May he participated for the first time in his career in the Giro d‚ÄôItalia, seeking the only points classification he had not yet won, but failed to win a stage and was sixth in the points ranking. His Telekom Team, keen on winning the Tour de France with Jan Ullrich, decided not to include him in the selection for that year's Tour, much to the discontent of Zabel, who declared at the start of the HEW Cyclassics that he would be leaving the team at the end of the year. He rode the Vuelta, but was unable to win a stage or the points classification despite multiple second places behind Alessandro Petacchi, and played no role in the World Championship in Madrid. In October he won Paris‚ÄìTours a third time, equalling the record in the classic of Gustave Danneels, Paul Maye and Guido Reybroeck. Zabel at prologue of the Tour de France 2006 in Strasbourg =2006‚Äì2008: Team Milram= At 35, Zabel left his team Telekom after 13 years, and signed on for the Italian-German team Milram in 2006, where he teamed up with Alessandro Petacchi. Petacchi was considered the fastest sprinter in the world by then and would focus on an Italian program, but the Italian broke his knee in the Giro, making Zabel the leader of the team that season. He had to wait until 24 May to take his first win of the season, a stage in the Bayern Rundfahrt. In the Tour, he was the team leader in the absence of a GC contender, and was ultimately second in the points classification, but his best stage results were two third places. In the Vuelta he won two stages, his first ProTour wins in 2006, before heading to the world championship. In Salzburg, he finished second in a three-man sprint with Paolo Bettini and Alejandro Valverde, his third podium finish in the world championships. In 2007 he won two stages in the Bayern Rundfahrt and one in the Tour de Suisse. He was again captain in the team selection for the Tour de France, after Alessandro Petacchi had been suspended for a positive salbutamol test. He wore the green jersey one day, was twice second and once third in a stage, but was third once more in the final points classification. In July he won one stage in the Deutschland Tour, his 13th in total, and won the race's points classification for the seventh time. In September he won the seventh stage in the Tour of Spain, ahead of world champion Bettini, totalling eight stage victories in the Vuelta throughout his career. Zabel in 2009 In 2008 he won one race, a stage win in the Tour of Valencia early in the season. In his last participation in the Tour de France, at age 38, he was once more third in the final points classification. In September 2008 Zabel stated he would retire the following month after 16 years as a professional cyclist with 209 professional road victories and many more podium finishes.\\" VeloNews, September 26, 2008, In December 2008 he joined the Columbia team as an advisor, to work alongside riders such as Mark Cavendish, Andr√© Greipel and Mark Renshaw.\\" Cyclingnews.com, 3 December 2008, Doping confession On 24 May 2007, Zabel and former Team Telekom teammate Rolf Aldag admitted using EPO to prepare for the 1996 Tour de France. Zabel told at a press conference he experimented with it for a week and stopped due to side effects. He apologized for lying about using EPO in the past. His confession was triggered by accusations by former Team Telekom masseur Jef d'Hont and the confessions of Bert Dietz, Udo B√∂lts and Christian Henn, all former members of Team Telekom. D'Hont's book, of which excerpts were printed in the German political magazine Der Spiegel in April 2007, accused members of Team Telekom of systematic doping with EPO in the mid-1990s.Masseur wirft Team Telekom systematisches Doping vor Der Spiegel, 28 April 2007 His name was also on the list of doping tests published by the French Senate on 24 July 2013 that were collected during the 1998 Tour de France and found positive for EPO when retested in 2004.. As a result, Zabel was suspended from his coaching role with Team Katusha and resigned his membership of the UCI's Professional Cycling Council. Days later, Zabel finally admitted to sueddeutsche.de and revealed the level of his truth- bending. He told the German publication that he actually used the substance between 1996 and 2003, as well as other banned products and methods. \\"EPO, cortisone, then even blood doping: it is still a big deal,\\" he said.http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/15107/Zabel-admits-to-lying- in-2007-about-extent-of-his-doping-now-confirms-eight-season-period-of- use.aspx Major results ;1992 : 4th Road race,

August 1996. A total of 10,318 athletes from 197 National Olympic Committees (NOCs), competed in 271 events in 26 sports. Athletes from 79 NOCs won at least one medal. The United States won the most gold medals (44), as well as the most medals overall (101) for the first time since 1984, and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics. Donovan Bailey of Canada set a world record in the men's 100m race (9.84 seconds). Michael Johnson of the United States set a world record in the 200m race (19.32 seconds) and Naim Suleymanoglu of Turkey set the record of unprecedented three consecutive Olympic titles in weightlifting. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, the Czech Republic, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Slovakia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan were represented for the first time at a Summer Games. Czech Republic and Slovakia had competed previously as Czechoslovakia, and the other nations were formerly part of the Soviet Union. Of these, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan did not receive any medals. This Olympics also marked Hong Kong's final appearance as a British colony, before its handover to China, during which it also won its first ever medal; a gold in sailing, making it the only medal Hong Kong ever won while under British rule. Medal table Andre Agassi won the gold medal in the men's singles tennis competition. The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals won by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code. Medals won in team competitions are counted only once, no matter how many athletes won medals as part of the team. ;Key  See also  * 1996 Summer Olympics * International Olympic Committee * 1996 Summer Paralympics medal table References  External links  Medal table Category:Summer Olympics medal tables ","title":"1996 Summer Olympics medal table"},{"id":"921013","text":"Frink Park in 1911 Frink Park is a 17.2 acre (70,000 m¬≤) park in the Leschi neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.

Javier Arzalluz Antia (24 August 1932 ‚Äì 28 February 2019) was a Basque politician, leader of the Basque Nationalist Party from 1979 until 2004. He was a nationalist and a Christian Democrat, considered during the period one of the most powerful politicians in the Basque Country, making also all strategic decisions in the party he led from 1986 onwards. Early years Arzallus was born in Azkoitia, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country. From a Carlist family, he studied in a Jesuit school in Durango. During the 1960s, he received degrees in Law and Philosophy at the University of Zaragoza. He spent some time in Frankfurt-am-Main preparing a thesis on German Christian Democracy and studying Theology. He became a Jesuit priest. After another period in Frankfurt and Madrid, he worked at the Jesuit University of Deusto. In 1969, he joined the clandestine Basque Nationalist Party, mentored by the pre-war leader Juan de Ajuriaguerra. In 1971, he was admitted to the leadership of the Biscayan branch. He was laicized and got married. Spanish transition to democracy In 1977 and 1979, he was elected as a member of the Spanish Congress of Deputies for the PNV in Gipuzkoa. His talks with Adolfo Su√°rez paved the way to the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country, contributing to its wording. He designed accordingly a strategy for the party along the lines of that Statute, called the Spirit of Arriaga. In 1979, he resigned his seat and succeeded Carlos Garaikoetxea as PNV leader, a position that he would hold until 2004. During his rule the PNV maintained its dominant position in the political life of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country. Later career Later in the 1980s, Garaikoetxea, the ruling lehendakari, struggled for autonomy from the party. Arzalluz, however, asserted the authority of the organization over individual members. This issue, among others, led in 1984 to a schism within the PNV, and to the creation of a new party Eusko Alkartasuna, led by Garaikoetxea. Arzalluz was the main spokesman for the Basque Nationalist Party, publishing his opinions every Sunday in the Basque newspaper Deia and in many public speeches during PNV rallies, some of which took place on Party Day and on the Day of the Basque Homeland. While liked by PNV voters, he was the least popular party leader among the general Spanish public in 1997. He had a reciprocal admiration for the Italian Christian Democrat leaders Francesco Cossiga and Giulio Andreotti. In spite of his contacts with European Christian Democrats, the PNV had to leave the Christian Democrat International in the 1990s because of pressure from the Spanish conservative People's Party. Besides his political role, he had also been a professor of Constitutional Law (in the Basque language) at the University of Deusto in Bilbao until 1999. Death He died in Bilbao on 28 February 2019 aged 86.}} References External links Aralluz, Xabier Category:Spanish Roman Catholic priests Category:1932 births Category:2019 deaths Category:University of Zaragoza alumni Category:Members of the constituent Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 1st Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the Basque Parliament Category:20th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:Laicized Roman Catholic priests Category:University of Deusto faculty Category:Leaders of political parties in Spain Category:Former Jesuits Category:Basque Roman Catholic priests ","title":"Xabier Arzalluz"},{"id":"921017","text":"William Stoughton may refer to: * William Stoughton (judge) (1631‚Äì1701), judge in charge of the Salem witch trials * William Stoughton (English constitutionalist) (fl. 1585), a member of parliament who promoted classical republicanism * William L.

It is licensed to Athens, Georgia, a legacy of the station's early years as a service of the University of Georgia there. Owned by the Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission (technically under the Georgia Board of Regents, along with the University System of Georgia), it is the flagship station of the statewide Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB) television network. WGTV's transmitter is located atop Stone Mountain in state-owned Stone Mountain Park, just east of Atlanta in Stone Mountain, Georgia. (It shares this short broadcast tower with NOAA Weather Radio station KEC80, and formerly with WABE [90.1 FM].) It is considered the primary (\\"parent\\") station for one (originally two) low-power translators, in the north Georgia mountains. Eight other full-power stations also simulcast the network across the state, originally relayed via microwave radio towers and now via communications satellite. There is no local insertion; all station identification is done on a single screen for all stations. History WGTV began broadcasting on May 23, 1960. It was licensed to the University of Georgia and operated out of the Georgia Center for Continuing Education. The station's VHF allocation was originally occupied by WSB-TV, which at that time was owned by the Atlanta Journal. The Journals competitor in Atlanta, the Atlanta Constitution, had applied for and received from the FCC a construction permit for channel 2, which was to be called WCON-TV. When the Journal and Constitution merged, media ownership rules of the day did not permit one entity to own two television stations in the same market. Plans for WCON-TV were scrapped and WSB-TV moved to channel 2 from channel 8 in 1951. The ABC affiliate WLTV broadcast on channel 8 from 1951 to 1953, when the station moved to channel 11 (now NBC affiliate WXIA-TV) to avoid radio interference with newly launched WROM-TV Rome, operating on adjacent channel 9. Cox Enterprises, owner of the Journal and Constitution, donated the channel 8 license to UGA for an educational television station, but it took seven more years to get the station on the air. In 1965, WGTV merged with a group of four stations owned by the state board of education to form Georgia Educational Television, later known as Georgia Public Television and the forerunner of today's GPB television network. In 1982, ownership of the license was transferred from the University of Georgia to the Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission. From 1965 to 1982, WGTV often broke from the main GETV/GPTV signal to broadcast programs of local interest to the Atlanta area. However, since all of the GPTV licenses were consolidated with the GPTC, network programming airs on WGTV at all times. Programming Prior to 2001, both stations went off the air at midnight; WPBA still goes off the air on Sunday nights. GPB used to sign off with Ray Charles' version of \\"Georgia On My Mind\\" which is the official state song, while showing scenes from the north Georgia mountains to the Georgia coast. Broadcast translators Both original broadcast translators are or were located near the state's border with South Carolina, in areas where coverage from a full-powered GPB transmitter is insufficient, due to the distance from the main transmitters and the hilly or mountainous terrain in northeast Georgia. A third translator, this time digital, replaced an analog one previously assigned to WJSP-TV. *W08EG-D Toccoa, former analog W68AF, which originally applied for digital on 10 * ~~W52AA~~ Carnesville, applied for digital on 12, dismissed October 2006, canceled August 2007 *W13DJ-D Carrollton, replaces analog W49AD, which had its license cancelled after this station went on Two (originally several) other translators are nominally assigned to other GPB TV stations, both to WNGH-TV, though all stations simulcast. Digital television RabbitEars TV Query for WGTV =Analog-to-digital conversion= WGTV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 8, on February 17, 2009, at 11:59 p.m., to conclude the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television.List of Digital Full- Power Stations The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 12 to channel 8. The station played a farewell video of outdoor scenes around Georgia set to the tune of \\"Georgia On My Mind\\" before permanently ceasing transmission. A final message at the end of the video read \\"In fond remembrance of the era of analog television broadcasting on Georgia Public Television.\\" The transition to digital ended nearly 49 years of analog broadcasting by WGTV. WGTV's analog signal was the strongest of the GPB TV network, covering most of the northern part of Georgia, extending in about a radius from the transmitter site. WGTV's digital/HDTV facility began broadcasting on December 20, 2007, on channel 12. However, it was at very low power, unable to be received through much (if not most) of metro Atlanta. It moved from channel 12 to full power on channel 8 after the analog shutdown in February 2009, using the same digital transmitter re-tuned to use the channel 8 antenna. This selection, made without conflict in the first-round digital channel election, is due to WDEF-TV in Chattanooga opting to stay digital on channel 12. WGTV was originally assigned channel 22 for DTV operations, but requested the frequency allotment change to channel 12 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), also allowing a change to 22 (from 59) by WSKC-CD. \\"Distant\\" viewers can receive two other GPB digital TV stations: WNGH-TV 4 (18.x) in the northwest metro area, and WJSP-TV 5 (28.x) in the southwest, though these stations are now on VHF (formerly UHF 33 and 23) and therefore require a larger antenna. The analog station had an effective radiated power (ERP) of 316 kilowatts (the maximum for high VHF), at height above average terrain (HAAT). The temporary digital station had an ERP of only 16 kW at . The previous 21 kW and current 17.3 kW are still well below the limit of 63 kW for digital stations on high VHF (channels 7 to 13), which would also be legally equivalent to what it had on analog. Because of this, reception is still difficult in much of metro Atlanta. This was expected to improve once the station changed to physical channel 7 in 2020, after May 1 (when other stations in phase 9 finish) but no later than July 3 (the end of phase 10, the final phase of the national repacking of all stations to below channel 37). The omnidirectional signal will increase to 62 kW toward the north-northwest with a directional antenna, but areas south and southeast of a line from Carrollton to Athens will not see an improvement in signal strength. The lowest signal strengths (18 kW) will be in slight nulls toward the southwest (to protect Alabama Public Television station WCIQ TV 7) and toward the east. Despite the channel change at noon on July 3, the station is still difficult to receive, as it has actually dropped to 17.3 kW under special temporary authority (STA), which expires at the end of 2020. The temporary antenna model listed is different from both the old channel 8 antenna and the channel 7 model listed in its permit, but all are at the same height, indicating that the old antenna must be removed before the new permanent one can be installed, tested, and switched over to for full-power operation.

Berbera is the capital of the Sahil region of Somaliland and is the main sea port of the country. In antiquity, Berbera was part of a chain of commercial port cities along the Somali seaboard. During the early modern period, Berbera was the most important place of trade in the Somali Peninsula. It later served as the capital of the British Somaliland protectorate from 1884 to 1941, when it was replaced by Hargeisa. In 1960, the British Somaliland protectorate gained independence as the State of Somaliland and united five days later with the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somalia) to form the Somali Republic.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: 2002), p.835 Located strategically on the oil route, the city has a deep seaport, which serves as the region's main commercial harbour. History =Antiquity= Berbera was part of the classical Somali city-states that engaged in a lucrative trade network connecting Somali merchants with Phoenicia, Ptolemic Egypt, Ancient Greece, Parthian Persia, Saba, Nabataea and the Roman Empire. Somali sailors used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the beden to transport their cargo.Journal of African History pg.50 by John Donnelly Fage and Roland Anthony Oliver Berbera preserves the ancient name of the coast along the southern shore of the Gulf of Aden. It is believed to be the ancient port of Malao () described as 800 stadia beyond the city of the Avalites, described in the eighth chapter of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, which was written by a Greek merchant in the first century AD. In the Periplus it is described as: =Middle ages= Al-Idrisi's world map from 'Al√Æ ibn Hasan al-H√ªf√Æ al- Q√¢sim√Æ's 1456 copy. Berbera 'ÿ®ÿ±ÿ®ÿ±ÿ©' can be clearly seen in this later edition of the Tabula Rogeriana Duan Chengshi, a Chinese Tang dynasty scholar, described in his written work of AD 863 the slave trade, ivory trade, and ambergris trade of Bobali, which is thought to be Berbera. The great city was also later mentioned by the Islamic traveller Ibn Sa'id as well as Ibn Battuta in the thirteenth century.I.M. Lewis, \\"The Somali Conquest of the Horn of Africa\\", Journal of African History, 1 (1960), p. 217 In Abu'l-Fida's, A Sketch of the Countries (), the present-day Gulf of Aden was called the Gulf of Berbera, which shows how important Berbera was in both regional and international trade during the medieval period.Identifiants et R√©f√©rentiels Sudoc Pour L'Enseignement Sup√©rieur et la Recherche - Ab≈´ al-FidƒÅ (1273-1331) Berbera was an important and well built settlement that served as a major harbor port for several successive Somali Kingdoms in the Middle Ages like the early Adal Kingdom, Ifat Sultanate and Adal Sultanate.I.M.

All of this was kept secret from European merchants.Abir, Era of the Princes, p. 17 Lieutenant C. J. Cruttenden, who wrote a memoir describing this portion of the Somali coast dated 12 May 1848, provided an account of the Berbera fair and an account of the historic environs of the town: \\"an aqueduct of stone and chunam, some nine miles [15 km] in length\\", which had once emptied into a presently dry reservoir adjacent to the ruins of a mosque. He explored part of its course from the reservoir past a number of tombs built of stones taken from the aqueduct to reach a spring, above which lay \\"the remains of a small fort or tower of chunam and stone ... on the hill-side immediately over the spring.\\" Cruttenden noted that in \\"style it was different to any houses now found on the Somali coast\\", and concluded with noting the presence in \\"the neighbourhood of the fort above mentioned [an] abundance of broken glass and pottery ... from which I infer that it was a place of considerable antiquity; but, though diligent search was made, no traces of inscriptions could be discovered.\\"C.

For centuries, Berbera had extensive trade relations with several historic ports in Arabia and the Indian subcontinent. Additionally, the Somali and Ethiopian interiors were very dependent on Berbera for trade, where most of the goods for export arrived from. During the 1833 trading season, the port town swelled up to 70,000 people, and upwards of 6,000 camels laden with goods arrived from the interior within a single day. Berbera was the main marketplace in the entire Somali seaboard for various goods procured from the interior, such as livestock, coffee, frankincense, myrrh, acacia gum, saffron, feathers, wax, ghee, hide (skin), gold and ivory. According to a trade journal published in 1856, Berbera was described as ‚Äúthe freest port in the world, and the most important trading place on the whole Arabian Gulf.‚Äù: > ‚ÄúThe only seaports of importance on this coast are Feyla [Zeila] and > Berbera; the former is an Arabian colony, dependent of Mocha, but Berbera is > independent of any foreign power.

These two sub-clans effectively administered the trade of the town, especially in the dealings of all transactions and brokerage between various parties to issuing protection agreements towards the foreign traders. In the year 1845, the two brotherly sub-clans had a dissension over the control of the trade of Berbera, which lead to a wider altercation in which each side sought outside support. With the backing of Haji Sharmarke Ali Saleh, the Reer Ahmed Nuh drove out their kinsmen and declared themselves the sole commercial masters of Berbera. The defeated Reer Yunis Nuh moved westwards and established the port of Bulhar, which later became a trading rival to Berbera. However, Sharmarke's actions was ultimately a political ruse to control Berbera for himself, which he ultimately achieved for several years. Berbera commanded most of the trade traffic with the Somali and Ethiopian interiors. The two main caravan trade routes from Berbera extended to Harar and Shewa in the west, and to the Shebelle basin in the south (although some caravans traveled to/from as far as the Jubba River). Moreover, the inland caravan trade routes were also concurrently used as pilgrim routes during the trading season by Somali Hajj pilgrims who resided in the deep interior: > ‚ÄúThe two routes to East Africa mentioned, namely that by the sea-board, and > the second by way of Berbera, through Somali-land, are essentially trade > routes, and are only subordinately and accidentally pilgrim routes. The > Berbera route is that usually taken advantage of by the Somali pilgrims > (except those living near the coast); and when the season of the pilgrimage > agrees with the period when the annual caravans depart for Berbera, as it > did in 1865, this route is always preferred; but when the seasons do not > agree, the pilgrims strike off from the caravan route, and make their way > direct to Mussuah, their course being to the east of Abyssinia.‚Äù Mocha, Aden, Jeddah and several other ports in Arabia had constant contact with Berbera in regard to general trade and commerce: > Berbera was a major port of considerable antiquity which traded, with Shoa, > Harar and the country of the interior, as well as with Jeddah, Mocha, Aden > and other ports of Arabia and lands to the east even further afield. In the early years of the nineteenth century, the Somalis of Berbera had a navigation act where they excluded Arab vessels and brought the goods and produce of the interior in their own ships to the Arabian ports: > Berbera held an annual fair during the cool rain-free months between October > and April. This long drawn out market handled immense quantities of coffee, > gum Arabic, myrrh and other commodities. These goods in the early nineteenth > century were almost exclusively handled by Somalis who, Salt says, had \\"a > kind of navigation act by which they exclude the Arab vessels from their > ports and bring the produce of their country either to Aden or Mocha in > their own dows.\\" In much of the 19th century, the trade between Berbera and Aden was so important to the later that when disturbances effected the Berbera trading season, Aden too suffered as a result. According to Captain Haines, who was then the colonial administrator of Aden (1839-1854), 80% of Aden's revenue in 1848 was derived from duties charged on imported goods from Berbera. Additionally, most of the coffee imported by Mocha (centre of the coffee trade in early modern times) arrived from Habr Awal Somali merchants from Berbera, who procured the coffee beans from the environs of Harar. Although the coffee beans were grown in Harar (present-day Ethiopia), the coffee was named Berbera Coffee in the international market, and the beans were considered superior to the locally grown varieties in Yemen. Berbera harbour, 1896 > Among the exports which went out from Berbera and other similar fairs on the > Somali coast was coffee which came from far inland at Harrar. Haines claimed > that two thirds of the coffee shipped at Mocha came from this source. There > was also a rising export of gum arabic which was much in demand in Europe > and the United States. There were small quantities of those ancient and > still valuable products, myrrh and frankincense. And there were hides and > skins and flocks of sheep and goats for which the Aden garrison created a > substantial demand. In the 1840s this trade was so important to Aden that > when disturbances in Somaliland on occasion delayed the closing of the > Berbera fair until after the end of Aden‚Äôs financial year, Haines regarded > the trade figures for that year as totally unreal. And well he might, for no > less than 80% of Aden‚Äôs revenue as late as 1848 came from duties charged on > products brought in from Berbera. According to Richard Francis Burton, who visited both Berbera and Harar during his travels, he repeated a famous Harari saying he heard in 1854: > \\"He who commands at Berbera, holds the beard of Harar in his hands.\\" The British explorer Richard Burton made two visits to this port, and his second visit was marred by an attack on his camp by a group of local Somali warriors, and although Burton was able to escape to Aden, one of his companions was killed.Lewis, A Modern History, p. 36 Burton, recognizing the importance of the port city wrote: =British Somaliland= 1911 map of Somalia showing Italian Somaliland and British Somaliland, including Berbera In 1888, after signing successive treaties with the various clans of the northern Somali coast, the British established a protectorate in the region referred to as British Somaliland.Hugh Chisholm (ed.), The encyclop√¶dia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 25, (At the University press: 1911), p.383. The British garrisoned the protectorate from Aden and administered it from their British India colony until 1898. British Somaliland was then administered by the Foreign Office until 1905 and afterwards by the Colonial Office. Despite Berbera's strategic location, being the only port with a sheltered harbor on the southern side of the Gulf of Aden (the gateway to the Suez Canal), the British later came to regret their nominal control of the region. In fact, Winston Churchill once visited Berbera in 1907 when he was Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, and he noted the protectorate be abandoned, since it was \\"unproductive, inhospitable, and the people are very hostile to occupation.\\"Samatar, Abdi Ismail The state and rural transformation in Northern Somalia, 1884‚Äì1986, Madison: 1989, University of Wisconsin Press, p. 31 The stated purposes of the establishment of the protectorate were to \\"secure a supply market and to exclude the interference of foreign powers.\\"Samatar p. 31 The British principally viewed the protectorate as a source for supplies of meat for their British Indian outpost in Aden through the maintenance of order in the coastal areas and protection of the caravan routes from the interior.Samatar, p. 32Samatar, Unhappy masses and the challenge of political Islam in the Horn of Africa, Somalia Online retrieved 10-03-27 Colonial administration during this period did not extend infrastructure beyond the coast (which left the Somali clans within the protectorate with greater autonomy),Samatar, The state and rural transformation in Northern Somalia, p. 42 and contrasted with the more interventionist colonial experience of Italian Somalia. However, there were plans in the early days of the protectorate to invest in major infrastructure projects such as the abandoned Berbera-Harar Railway initiative, which was vetoed by parliament on the grounds that it would harm the cordial agreement (entente cordiale) between France and Britain. > A railway from Berbera to Harrar in Abyssinia was suggested as a means of > bringing the interior of the protectorate within easy access, and at the > same time of catering for the trade of Abyssinia; but it was vetoed on the > ground that to compete with the French railway from Jibouti to Adis Ababa > would be poor policy at a time when the entente cordiale had just been > firmly cemented.The Navy Everywhere, 1919. p. 244 Bebrera native town (Daroole) as seen from the customs pier In August 1940, during the East African Campaign, British Somaliland was briefly occupied by Italy after a large invasion force defeated British colonial troops at the Battle of Tug Argan. During this period, the British rounded up soldiers and governmental officials to evacuate them from the territory through Berbera. In total, 7,000 people, including civilians, were evacuated.Playfair (1954), p. 178 The Somalis serving in the Somaliland Camel Corps were given the choice of evacuation or disbandment; the majority chose to remain and were allowed to retain their arms.Wavell, p. 2724 In March 1941, the British forces recaptured the protectorate during Operation Appearance after a six-month occupation. The first WW2 Australian POWs were taken hostage here in 1940. The British Somaliland protectorate gained its independence on 26 June 1960 as the State of Somaliland, before uniting as planned five days later with the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somalia) to form the Somali Republic. =Modern= In the post-independence period, Berbera was administered as the part of the North-Western province of the Somali Republic. After the collapse of the Somali central government and the ouster of the dictatorship of General Siad Barre in 1991, the Somali National Movement (SNM), which was an insurgent movement fighting to remove the yoke of Barre's dictatorship from the Northern region of the Somali Republic, declared the national independence of the Republic of Somaliland. A slow process of infrastructural reconstruction subsequently began in Berbera and other towns in the region. Geography =Location and habitat= The Berbera landscape Berbera is located in coastal region of Somaliland Republic. An old port city, it has the only sheltered harbour on the southern side of the Gulf of Aden. The landscape around town, along with Somaliland's coastal lowlands, is semi-arid land. Popular local beaches, such as Bathela and Batalale, have earned the city the nickname Beach City. =Climate= Berbera features a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh). It has long, very hot summers and short, hot winters, as well as very little rainfall. Average high temperatures consistently exceed (104 ¬∞F) during nearly four months of summertime (June, July, August and September). Daytime heat on summer nights is high, with average low temperatures of around (86 ¬∞F). During the coolest months of the year, average high temperatures remain above (84.2 ¬∞F) and average low temperatures also surpass (68 ¬∞F). Although precipitation is low, the relative humidity is very high throughout the year and the atmosphere is simultaneously moist. The combination of the desert heat and the excessive moisture make apparent temperatures reach extremely high levels. Annual average rainfall is minimal, with only (2.05 in) of precipitation. There are between 5 and 8 rainy days on average annually. Bright sunshine likely occur during about 84% of the total daytime hours and average annual cloudiness is very low. Demographics Historically, Berbera was inhabited by the Reer Ahmed Nuh and Yunis Nuh lineages of the Sa'ad Musa, Habr Awal. In more recent times, however, the Issa Musa sub-clan of the Habr Awal have come to make up the majority of the town's inhabitants. Education Berbera Airport Terminal There are 30 primary schools operating in Berbera city totaling 63,641 students. The broader Berbera district has 49 schools serving 90,310 students. Economy Berbera Port A number of products are exported through the Port of Berbera, including livestock, gum arabic, frankincense, and myrrh. Its seaborne trade is chiefly with Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, and Aden in Yemen, to the north. Additionally, goods from Ethiopia are also exported through the facility.\\"Ethiopia, Somaliland envisage exploiting Barbara port\\", Ethiopian News Agency, 29 July 2009 (accessed 1 November 2009) The seaside boasts watersport tourist activity such as scuba diving, snorkeling, surfing and coral reefs.Somalia attractions, Berbera Seaside retrieved 29 November 2013 Transportation Berbera is the terminus of roads from Hargeisa and Burco. The city has one of Somaliland's major class seaports, the Port of Berbera. It historically served as a naval and missile base for the Somali government. Following an agreement between the Somali Republic and the USSR in 1962, the port's facilities were patronized by the Soviets and was later significantly upgraded in 1969. The Berbera seaport was later expanded for U.S. military use, after the Somali authorities strengthened ties with the American government. For air transportation, the city is served by the Berbera Airport. It has an extensive runway.

The B4-PC11 is designed to Standard Class specifications, meaning that it has a 15-metre wingspan and no flaps. Air brakes are provided on the top surface of each wing for glidepath control. Construction is aluminium, with foam ribs in the mainplane, fin and tailplane. Development The design of this glider originated in the 1960s, when the company Firma Rheintalwerke G. Basten (from which the \\"B\\" in the original designation is derived) manufactured the first two prototypes. The designers were Ingo Herbst, Manfred K√ºppers and Rudolf Reinke. The first flight of the first prototype took place on 7 November 1966. However, no series production was started. In 1972 Pilatus bought the manufacturing licence for the B-4 and renamed it the B4-PC11. In the spring of the same year the first production example (numbered HB-1100) made its first flight. A total of 322 B4-PC11s of all versions were built by Pilatus by 1980, when the license to manufacture the craft was sold to Nippi Aircraft of Japan, who built only 13 examples, plus a two-seater designated the Nippi B4T.http://www.nippi.co.jp/history/history1980.html B4T in History of Nippi company (in Japanese:Click PHOTO icon after word B4T to see the photo) Subsequently, in 1994, EWMS Technomanagement bought the rights to produce and service the B4-PC11.

Frauenkirche, Dresden George B√§hr (15 March 1666 ‚Äì 16 March 1738) was a German architect. Life George B√§hr was born into a poor family in F√ºrstenwalde (now a part of Geising, Saxony), the son of a weaver. The village priest, however, helped pay for his education, and B√§hr was able to become a carpenter's apprentice in Lauenstein, Saxony. In 1690, B√§hr went to Dresden to start work as a carpenter. His dream was to go to Italy and see the famous buildings there, so in his spare time he studied mechanics, calling himself both an artist and a mechanic, and designing not only castles and palaces but also sketches of organs. In 1705, aged 39, Bahr was named Dresden's City Master Carpenter, although he did not even have a master carpenter's certificate. One of B√§hr's main goals was to modernise the city's churches. He believed that the existing buildings did no justice to Protestant church services in particular. His first building was the parish church in the Loschwitz area of Dresden, a building in the shape of a stretched-out octagon, completed in 1708. The Dresden Waisenhauskirche (Orphanage Church) was built around 1710, followed by the Dreifaltigkeitskirche (Trinity Church) in Schmiedeberg, in the Ore Mountains, 1713-1716. Between 1719 and 1726 the church in Forchheim was built, as well as more in K√∂nigstein, Hohnstein and Kesselsdorf (all in Saxony) and a considerable amount of housing in Dresden. But B√§hr is most famous for designing the Frauenkirche in Dresden. He was given the task in 1722; in 1726, the design was approved and work began. From 1730, B√§hr became the first in Germany to go by the title of ‚ÄúArchitect‚Äù. Whilst working on the Frauenkirche, B√§hr also oversaw the building of the Dreik√∂nigskirche (Church of the Three Kings) in Dresden's Neustadt area ‚Äì the church had however been designed by Matth√§us Daniel P√∂ppelmann. George B√§hr did not live to see the Frauenkirche completed ‚Äì he died in Dresden, aged 72, and was buried in the church's vaults. In 2004, a memorial was built to him in the castle at Lauenstein, where he learned his trade. DNA Analysis In 2018, researchers from the University of Tuebingen and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena analyzed the genome of George B√§hr. They found that he most likely had light skin pigmentation, brown eyes and is of central European origin.

The ring of \\"benches\\" around the outside contains the power supplies‚Äîa design element that Cray re-used on the Cray-1. Each of the pie-wedges of the computer can be removed for servicing, and heat exhausts through the central core. The CDC 8600 was the last of Seymour Cray's supercomputer designs while he worked for Control Data Corporation. As the natural successor to the CDC 6600 and CDC 7600, the 8600 was intended to be about 10 times as fast as the 7600, already the fastest computer on the market. The design was essentially four 7600's, packed into a very small chassis so they could run at higher clock speeds. Development started in 1968, shortly after the release of the 7600, but the project soon started to bog down. The dense packaging of the system led to serious reliability problems and difficulty cooling the individual components. By 1971, CDC was having cash-flow problems and the design was still not coming together, prompting Cray to leave the company in 1972. The 8600 design effort was eventually canceled in 1974, and Control Data moved on to the CDC STAR-100 series instead. Cray revisited the 8600's basic design in his Cray-2 of the early 1980s. The introduction of integrated circuits solved the problems with dense packaging and liquid cooling addressed the heat issues. The Cray-2 is very similar to the 8600 both physically and conceptually. Design In the 1960s, computer design was based on mounting electronic components (transistors, resistors, etc.) on circuit boards. Several boards formed a discrete logic element of the machine, known as a module. Overall machine cycle speed is strongly related to the signal path‚Äîthe length of the wiring‚Äîrequiring high-speed computers to make their modules as small as possible. This was at odds with the need to make the modules themselves more complex to increase functionality. By the late 1960s, individual components had stopped getting much smaller, so to increase the complexity of the machines, the modules would have to grow. In theory, this could slow the machine down due to signalling delays. Cray aimed to solve these contradictory problems by doing both; making each module larger and crammed with many more components, while at the same time making the computer as a whole smaller by packing the modules closer together inside the machine. Between the time the 7600 was developed and work on the 8600 began, there had been no process improvements in the components themselves, so any performance improvements had to come solely from packaging. For the new design, they used modules containing eight four-layer circuit boards about 8\\" by 6\\", resulting in a stack the size of a large textbook and using up about 3 kilowatts of power. The modules were then packed into a mainframe chassis that was comparatively tiny, a 16-sided cylinder about one meter across and high, sitting on top of a ring of power supplies. The proposed design bears a strong resemblance to the later Cray-2, but even shorter and smaller in diameter.\\"8600 prototype photo\\" With all of this power being dissipated in such a small space, cooling was a major design issue. Cray's refrigeration engineer, Dean Roush, formerly of Amana, placed a sheet of copper inside each of the circuit boards, removing the heat to a copper block on one end where it was cooled by a freon system. This further increased the weight and complexity of the modules, to the point where each one weighed about . The external cooling system was considerably larger than the machine itself. The electronic components were likewise improved over previous designs. The main CPU circuits moved to ECL-based logic, enabling a clock speed increase to 125MHz (8ns cycle time) from the 7600's 36.4MHz (27.5ns cycle time) an increase of about four times. Main memory was also moved to an ECL implementation and the machine was equipped with a whopping-for-the-times 256k-words (2 megabytes) standard. The design spread the memory across 64 banks for fast access at about 8 ns/word, even though the cycle time of any one bank was about 250 ns. A high-speed core memory with a 20 ns access (overall) was also designed as a backup to the semiconductor memory. Cray decided that the 8600 would include four complete CPUs sharing the main memory. To improve overall throughput, the machine could operate in a special mode that sent a single instruction to all four processors with different data. This technique, today known as SIMD, reduced the total number of memory accesses because the instruction was only read once, instead of four times. Each processor was about 2.5 times as fast as a 7600, so with all four running the machine as a whole would be about 10 times as fast, at about 100 MFLOPS. The government made it clear that all future computer purchases would require ASCII processing. To meet this requirement, the 8600 used a 64-bit word (eight eight-bit characters) instead of the earlier 60-bit word (ten six-bit characters) used in the 6600 and 7600. As in prior designs, instructions were \\"stuffed\\" into words, with each instruction taking up either 16- or 32-bits (up from 15/30). The 8600 no longer used the A or B registers as in previous designs, and included a set of 16 general- purpose X registers instead. A 6600/7600 Peripheral Processor system was used for I/O, largely unchanged. Some effort was made to help compatibility between the older machines and the 8600, but the change in word length made this difficult. Instead, floating point formats were retained, allowing Fortran code to port directly. Company problems In 1971 Control Data was undergoing a \\"belt tightening\\" due to the cost of an ongoing lawsuit against IBM, and asked all divisions to reduce their payroll by 10%. Cray begged to Control Data to exempt his division so he could get the 8600 shipping. When Control Data refused this request, he cut his own pay to minimum wage to solve the problem. By 1972 it appeared that even Cray's legendary module design abilities were failing him in the case of the 8600. Reliability was so poor that it appeared impossible to get a whole machine working. This was not the first time this had happened: on the 6600 project Cray had to start over from scratch, and the 7600 was in production for some time before it started working reliably. In this case Cray decided the current design was a dead-end, and told William Norris (CDC's CEO) that the only way forward was to redesign the machine from scratch. The finances of the company were dangerous, and Norris decided that he couldn't take the risk; Cray would have to continue with the current design. In 1972 Cray decided that he couldn't work under such conditions, and left CDC to form Cray Research. For his new work he abandoned the multiprocessor concept, concerned that software of the era would be unable to take full advantage of the CPUs. He may have come to this conclusion after the ILLIAC IV finally entered operation at about the same time, and proved to have disappointing performance. Team members convinced Norris that the 8600 could be completed even without Cray, and work continued at the Chippewa Lab. By 1974 the machine still didn't work correctly. Jim Thornton's competing STAR design had reached production quality at this point, and the 8600 project was then cancelled. In service STAR proved to have poor real-world performance, and when the Cray-1 entered the market in 1976, CDC was quickly pushed from the supercomputer market. An effort was made to re-enter the market in the 1980s with the ETA-10, but this ended poorly.

The channel's programming is primarily targeted at families, and features a mix of television movies and miniseries, original and acquired television series, and lifestyle programs. As of February 2015, Hallmark Channel is available to approximately 85,439,000 pay television households (73.4% of households with television) in the United States. Despite largely being an apolitical brand, Hallmark Channel has garnered a following among politically conservative viewers in suburban and rural areas who, according to Manhattan Institute for Policy Research's Steven Malanga in a Los Angeles Times op-ed, feel the network and its original programming feed their desire to \\"express traditional family values and also to steer away from political themes and stories that denigrate religion.\\" Their biggest conservative-leaning competition in terms of entertainment programming is INSP, with Fetv as a lesser competitor. Much of the filming for Hallmark Channel's most popular shows is done in Canada, with Canadian stars, scenery and talent. History The Hallmark Channel traces its history to the launch of two separate religious cable channels, the American Christian Television System (ACTS) and the Vision Interfaith Satellite Network (VISN). The two networks began alternating time on a shared transponder slot on the Galaxy III satellite in 1992. Under the original timeshare agreement, the network was branded as VISN/ACTS. Each network was provided time for its programming blocks, and would use their own logos. VISN launched on July 1, 1988, and was founded by the National Interfaith Cable Coalition, in cooperation with several cable providers. The coalition's membership consisted of 65 different religious groups. It aired for about 16 hours a day and ran religious programs from mainline Protestant denominations such as the United Methodist Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the United Church of Christ. In addition, Roman Catholic, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jewish, and Islamic faiths also provided some programming. VISN aired during the morning and evening hours. ACTS commenced operations in 1984, and was owned by the Southern Baptist Convention. It aired programming from evangelical and fundamentalist non- charismatic Christian groups such as the SBC, the Christian Reformed Church, and the Association of Regular Baptist Churches, as well as well-known evangelists such as Jerry Falwell, Charles Stanley and D. James Kennedy. Both channels aired several hours a week of religious children's programs, some of which overlapped, including Sunshine Factory, Joy Junction, Davey and Goliath, and Jot. In 1993, the network was renamed as the Faith and Values Channel. It began adding a few secular programs during this time, such as exercise shows, health and cooking shows, and family-oriented drama series and movies. =Odyssey Network= In 1995, cable conglomerate Tele-Communications Inc.'s Liberty Media acquired a 49% ownership stake in the Faith and Values Channel, and took over operational control of the network. It added more secular programming to the network and reduced religious programming to about 10 hours a day. In 1996, the network was rebranded as the Odyssey Network (although on- air promotions often referred to the network simply as \\"Odyssey\\"), and launched a website, Odysseyfamily.com, which was used to provide program listings for the network. Logo as Odyssey Network from 1996 to 2001 In 1997, channel CEO Gary Hill died. The Teaching of Christ, The Daily Mass and A Biblical Portrait of Marriage were regular religious programs on the channel. Wholesome off-network series on the channel were Brooklyn Bridge and Trapper John, M.D., as well as the Davey and Goliath claymation kids' show. The channel produced shows under the Odyssey Productions name. The channel had a variety show hosted by gospel singer CeCe Winans called CeCe's Place and launched Landmarks of Faith on July 1, 1998. Hallmark Entertainment and The Jim Henson Company bought significant stakes, paid partly through programming commitments, in Odyssey in late 1998. Liberty had convinced Hallmark not to launch its own domestic channel, given difficulty getting carriage. National Interfaith Cable Coalition and Hallmark-Henson would have equal shares while Liberty would increase its stake, while the three groups would share control of the board. Hallmark and Henson would have say over chief executive selection. While adding Henson's and Hallmark's libraries, the channel could not make major programming format changes, so cable systems could not drop them. Hallmark hired former Fox Kids Network worldwide vice-chairman Margaret Loesch that year to overhaul Odyssey into a family channel. Under the new ownership structure, Odyssey underwent a major programming revamp on April 4, 1999 using the tagline \\"a Hallmark and Henson Network\\". The revamp decreased the amount of religious programs on the network down to an average four hours a day, although more hours were religious on the weekend. The channel began to focus more on family-targeted entertainment programming including some classic sitcoms, children's programs and additional family-oriented movies. The premiere show under the new schedule was Gulliver's Travels miniseries, in its cable premiere, was produced by Hallmark and Henson. Henson programming on the channel included The Muppet Show and Fraggle Rock. This revamp had other children's programming like the syndicated Zoobilee Zoo and The Archie Show. The new programming even tapped Hallmark Entertainment's Hal Roach Studios library for Leonard Maltin Presents. In 2000, the channel aired its first original holiday movie. Crown Media Holdings, Inc. in 2000 was formed with Hallmark Entertainment, Chase Equity Associates, Liberty Media, and the National Interfaith Cable Coalition transferred their 77.5 percent total interest in the Odyssey Network into Crown Media Holdings. Henson Company, now owned by EM.TV & Merchandising, traded in March 2001 Crown Media the remaining ownership in the Odyssey Network for 8% in Crown stock. =Hallmark Channel= On August 5, 2001, the channel underwent yet another rebranding, relaunching as the Hallmark Channel. After agreeing to distribute a religious digital cable network among other items to lift restrictions on the Odyssey channel to effect the rebranding with plans to quickly add original programming. The Infinite Worlds of H.G. Wells mini-series was the first programming under the rebranding. New original programming for the year included the third installment of its Sherlock Holmes film series and five other films, two mini- series and three scripted series, one coming from The Jim Henson Company. In April 2001, Crown Media purchased 700 titles from the film library Hallmark Entertainment Distribution, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hallmark Entertainment, for its cable channels and Crown Interactive. The channel began a Sunday night mystery movie wheel series called Mystery Movie in 2005. Hallmark Channel's headquarters in Studio City, California In 2002, the Hallmark Channel premiered a weekday morning talk show, New Morning. A Sunday morning version, hosted by Naomi Judd, titled Naomi's New Morning, debuted in 2005 and lasted two years before being pulled from the schedule in early 2007. Hallmark Channels in international markets were sold for about $242 million in 2005 to Sparrowhawk Media, a private equity group backed by Providence Equity Partners and 3i. The channel in 2005 had its highest-rated year with 34% increase in viewers and ranked seventh in growth. 2005's highest-rated ad- supported basic cable movie with a 3.6 household rating was \\"Meet the Santas\\" on Hallmark. In 2006, the channel acquired a license for 35 Warner Bros. features including \\"Troy\\" (2007) and \\"March of the Penguins\\" (2005), costing in the multimillion-dollar range. The channel set a new high rating (4.2 household) for an original movie, The Christmas Card, in 2006. With the expiration of RHI Entertainment's exclusive contract with Hallmark Channel, Larry Levinson Productions became the channel's sole producer. In 2007, additional producers were added as suppliers as the channel increased the number of original films by 50% from 20 in 2007 to 30 in 2008. In January 2008, the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign purchased an hour of Hallmark Channel's primetime slots under a paid programming arrangement to run a town hall special promoting Clinton's campaign for President of the United States on February 4, the day before the multi-state \\"Super Tuesday\\" primaries. The wheel series \\"Mystery Movie\\" was discontinued in 2008 as the channel was doing better with lighter romances. With a change in company president in May 2009, the new president planned to move the channel away from dependence on the Western to more light hearted fare to de-age their viewers without alienating their current viewers and match the Hallmark brand more. In mid-June 2009, the network announced it would sell individual ad breaks featuring a single advertiser. The so-called \\"Fast Breaks\\" are prefaced with short bumpers announcing that the program streaming will return after a 30-second break. The cost of such standalone spots is about double that of a regular 30-second commercial on the channel. Hallmark Channel signed insurance company Mutual of Omaha as the first buyer. In late 2009, The National Tree film kicked off its first annual \\"Countdown to Christmas\\" seasonal programming. Hallmark characters, Hoops & Yoyo, hosted Friday \\"Movie Night\\" during the Countdown. 2010 saw the channel make a push into lifestyle programming. A January 2010 multi-year deal with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSLO) brought The Martha Stewart Show from syndication to Hallmark in September. Steward would also produce four prime-time one hour specials for the channel. Hallmark was looking to be a holiday programming destination. On March 26, 2010, a new home and lifestyle block during weekday daytime of Martha Stewart shows started airing on the channel for seven hours. A shorter Stewart block would also air on the weekends. After one month on air with lackluster ratings, the block was reduced to five hours. In January 2012, the channel canceled The Martha Stewart Show given the show's cost effective with the end of the season in May with reruns through the summer months, but intend to retain a couple of MSLO shows. Hallmark Channel and co-owned film service Hallmark Movie Channel were dropped by AT&T; U-verse on September 1, 2010, due to a carriage dispute resulting from a proposed increase in retransmission consent payments that U-verse considered to be disproportionate with the lower audience viewership for the channels at the time. As of July 23, 2015, both channels returned to U-verse. In 2011, Hallmark started its animal-featuring shows with Hero Dog Awards. Its 2014 Kitten Bowl, up against the Super Bowl, got 1 million viewers. Jingle, the husky pup (a Hallmark merchandising character), was featured in an animated Christmas special, Jingle All the Way, on November 25, 2011. In 2012, \\"Christmas in July\\" programming was launched over a weekend to promote Hallmark Cards' new holiday ornaments debut and became an annual event. In the fourth quarter of 2012, Hallmark Channel did a makeover of its daytime schedule. The channel launched a Marie! talk show starring Marie Osmond, and Home & Family, while running repeats of three MSLO programs. Two TV pilot movies, Cedar Cove and When Calls the Heart, both book adaptations, were also shown. Home & Family was previously on The Family Channel. Cedar Cove was ordered to a series, the channel's first prime time original series, in October 2012 even before its January 2013 movie premiere. and When Calls was also picked up as a series. However, Marie! was canceled after its first season. With the 2011‚Äì2012 season, ABC picked up Hallmark Hall of Fame with the Hallmark Channel showing each episode a week later. The Hall of Fame series was moved from ABC to Hallmark with the 2014‚Äì2015 season and would air as many as four times a year. The first episode to debut on Hallmark Channel was One Christmas Eve, starring Anne Heche. On the cable channel, four original movies at most would air as a part of the Hall of Fame with multiple encores. The HHOF library would also be available. On March 15, 2013, the channel introduced a new family-oriented Friday night movie block, Walden Family Theater, in partnership with Walden Media and others. In an unusual deal in 2013, CBS syndicated The Good Wife to Hallmark, two streaming services and TV stations, who got the shows on weekends. While the show met its good story-telling goal with the series showing four hours in prime time, the channel pulled the show after many months as it did not fit in other ways. Two new series, The Good Witch and Sign, Sealed, Delivered, were picked up for the 2014‚Äì2015 season. Sign comes from Martha Williamson, while the Good Witch was transitioning from a movie series. In February 2015, the channel aired its first \\"Countdown to Valentine's\\" programming event based on its success with \\"Countdown to Christmas\\" accounting for 30% of annual ad revenue. In April 2014, the channel launched a TV Everywhere video on-demand service, \\"Hallmark Channel Everywhere\\", which offers a streaming selection of Hallmark Channel films and series for subscribers on participating television providers. In 2015, Mariah Carey directed and starred in a Christmas movie for Hallmark. She also hosted Mariah Carey's Merriest Christmas which was the channel's most- viewed show. Thus in May 2016, Carey signed a three-telefilm deal for her to develop, executive-produce, direct, costar, and write an original song for three movies with one for \\"Countdown to Valentine's Day\\". The channel's first \\"Winterfest\\" seasonal programming was in January 2016. At its March 2016 upfronts, Hallmark Channel executives revealed that they planned to divide their programming into themed seasons year-round, to build upon the success of Countdown to Christmas and other franchises. On October 20, 2016, Hallmark Channel and the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries channel were added to the Sling TV service. On November 15, 2017, PlayStation Vue added Hallmark Channel, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, and Hallmark Drama to its lineup. In October 2017, Hallmark Channel launched a new, over-the-top subscription service known as Hallmark Movies Now, which features new and existing original content from the network. In October 2018, the three Hallmark linear channels were added to streaming service Philo. With SiriusXM, Crown Media launched the Hallmark Channel Radio channel on November 1, 2018 as 24/7 holiday music format as a part of the network's \\"Countdown to Christmas\\" campaign. Network talent would introduce the music and include behind the scenes segments from its holiday movies. In November 2017, the channel beat all four major broadcast networks in the ratings one night with its Hallmark Hall of Fame movie, The Christmas Train. In March 2019, Hallmark announced it had dropped Lori Loughlin from future company projects due to her role in the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal. In December 2019, the channel stopped airing advertisements for the online wedding registry Zola.com that included two brides kissing each other, because of complaints that it was lesbians kissing and promoted same-sex marriages. A main complainant was One Million Moms, a division of the socially conservative American Family Association, which has been designated an anti- LGBTQ hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Similar advertisements with heterosexual couples kissing were not pulled. As a result, social media users called for a boycott of the channel, while competitors like Netflix and the Disney-owned Freeform cable channel responded by touting their LGBTQ inclusivity. On December 15, Hallmark reversed its decision and said it would reinstate the advertisements and work with GLAAD, an LGBTQ media monitoring organization, to create more inclusive programming. Programming Hallmark Channel's programming consists of classic and some recent/original television series, and original made-for-TV movies. It also airs the Hallmark Hall of Fame anthology series. Original programs broadcast on the network include the daytime talk show Home & Family (which originated on Freeform when it was known as The Family Channel, in April 1996) and When Calls the Heart (which is based on the novels by Janette Oke). The network's original programming initially consisted mainly of lifestyle programs and made-for-TV movies; Hallmark Channel debuted its first prime time original scripted series in July 2013, with the premiere of Cedar Cove (which is based on the novels by Debbie Macomber). =Original movies= The network's made-for-TV movies are characterized as family-friendly and inspirational, ranging from holiday- themed films to westerns. In the early stages of the channel's development, Hallmark Channel had a steady one-movie-a-month, or 12-a-year, production schedule with the films mainly being produced by RHI Entertainment. However, in 2008, Crown Media had ramped up its production schedule to approximately 30 movies a year and opened up to other production companies, though RHI still produces some movies for Hallmark Channel.Hallmark Channel Press Release: 7/12/2007 The network premiered 35 original movies during the period from 2009 to 2010. Hallmark original movies were budgeted at $2.2 million in 2007. Hallmark does not pay the full cost of films, thus the production company deficit-financed them. Series *Hallmark Hall of Fame: Originally only an encore or library home for the Hallmark Hall of Fame anthology film series, the series moved its original showings to the channel in 2014. *Mystery Movie (also Hallmark Channel Mystery Wheel): The channel began a Sunday night mystery movie wheel series called Mystery Movie in 2004. This wheel series consisted of four individual movie series of four films that would also be later shown on Hallmark Movie Channel. Two of the film series were Mystery Woman and Jane Doe. A successor series, Original Mystery Wheel, was established in 2015 on the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries channel. *Walden Family Theater (2013) On March 15, 2013, the channel started its family friendly Friday night movie series, Walden Family Theater in partnership with Walden Media, Arc Entertainment, Procter & Gamble and Walmart. P&G; and Walmart were sponsoring partners with Walmart selling the movies DVD in store the Tuesday after airing, while Arc and Walden were producing partners. The first movie was the world premiere of Return to Nim's Island, one of six new films produced for the series. Space Warriors was shown later in the premier season, with additional films drawn from Hallmark's library of films. The series' second season was launched on September 6, 2013 with the premiere of the film, Dear Dumb Diary based upon the Scholastic book, with the Civil Rights era drama The Watsons Go to Birmingham premiering next. =Seasonal programming= Hallmark Channel is known for scheduling themed programming around major holidays such as Christmas, Mother's Day, and Valentine's Day‚Äîfeaturing new original movies relevant to said holiday. With the introduction of its Countdown to Christmas branding in 2009, the channel gradually expanded the number of seasonal programming events it holds. At its 2016 upfronts, the network stated that it had, alongside its holiday events, begun to divide its schedule into themed \\"seasons\\" throughout the entire year. Some of these events are associated with the network's different original series. Crown Media CEO Bill Abbott explained that this strategy allowed the network to be positioned as \\"a year-round destination for celebrations\\", which need not depend on a single series or franchise to bolster its viewership. This programming strategy also creates synergies with Hallmark Cards. * \\"Winterfest\\" (2016‚Äìpresent) is broadcast in January; its first original film was Love In Paradise. * \\"Countdown to Valentine's\\" (2015‚Äìpresent) In 2015, the event was 15 days long with four original movie premieres. * \\"Spring Fever\\", formerly \\"Spring Fling\\", is in March and April. Its two original series as of 2016 were When Calls the Heart and Good Witch * \\"Countdown to Summer\\" was launched in May 2019. *\\"Summer Nights\\" has its franchise show in Chesapeake Shores as of 2016. *\\"June Wedding\\" *\\"Fall Harvest\\" (2015‚Äìpresent) airs during September and most of October, primarily airing autumn-themed movies (sometimes relating to Halloween). *\\"Five Nights Stuffed Full of Original Holiday Movies\\" (2015‚Äìpresent), which airs near Thanksgiving. Countdown to Christmas From the last weekend in October until January 1, Hallmark Channel runs a seasonal block called Countdown to Christmas, featuring a mix of holiday movies, specials and holiday-themed original programming. The block is branded as Countdown to New Years from December 26 until January 1 and culminates with the channel's broadcast of the Tournament of Roses Parade. Countdown to Christmas started in 2009, while the channel's first holiday original movie was aired in 2000. Hallmark characters, Hoops & Yoyo, hosted Friday \\"Movie Night\\", starting in 2009 during the Countdown. Countdown had 12 original movies in 2013 and 21 in 2016. Actresses frequently featured in the channel's Christmas films (dubbed the \\"Queens of Christmas\\") include Rachel Boston, Candace Cameron Bure (who does other work for Hallmark Channel, mainly as Aurora Teagarden), Lacey Chabert, Erin Krakow, Kellie Martin, Danica McKellar. Autumn Reeser and Alicia Witt Hallmark's \\"Christmas TV ratings system\\" has designations like \\"F for Family\\" and \\"J for Joy\\". Since 2012, the network has also held a Christmas in July event with encore airings of previous movies: it is used as a platform to launch Hallmark Cards' upcoming holiday ornament lines. In 2013, the event was expanded with Home & Family giving holiday tips. In 2014, the channel added a theatrical movie premiere. By 2015, the event included one new movie. In 2014, the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Cards collaborated for the first time on a movie, Northpole, which was shown during Countdown to Christmas. During the 2017 holiday season, the Hallmark Channel premiered 33 original Christmas holiday films, up from a total of 28 holiday movies in 2016. Hallmark has a total of 136 Christmas holiday-themed movies in their original library of films. For 2018, Hallmark Channel partnered with Sirius XM to launch \\"Hallmark Channel Radio\\"‚Äîa Christmas music channel hosted by Hallmark Channel talent (such as Holly Robinson Peete and Lacey Chabert), and featuring behind-the-scenes features relating to Countdown to Christmas programming. In February 2019, it was announced that in honor of the upcoming 10th anniversary of the Countdown to Christmas event, the channel would air selections of movies from the franchise on Friday nights throughout the year. =Animal special franchise= With the success of the Dog Hero Awards, the channel started a franchise out of the show with additional shows that counter programming major sporting events. Beyond the Dog Hero Awards and the Kitten Bowl, the channel has Paw-Star Game, on during MLB's All-Star Game, and Summer Kitten Games countering in its first showing the Rio Olympics. On February 2, 2014, the Hallmark Channel partnered with New York's North Shore Animal League and Last Hope Animal Rescue to debut the Kitten Bowl during Super Bowl XLVIII. The event ‚Äì hosted by Beth Stern and announcers John Sterling and Mary Carillo ‚Äì is designed as counterprogramming to the Super Bowl and airs during the game's halftime show, and is similar to another animal-themed event that debuted nine years earlier on Animal Planet, the Puppy Bowl. Kitten Bowl II returned on February 1, 2015, and was watched by 1.3 million viewers. A new Kitten Bowl has aired every year since, running repeatedly on Super Bowl Sunday in a three-hour program that includes \\"playoff games\\". In 2019 Hallmark added Cat Bowl, which premiered on Super Bowl weekend. = Content standards = The Hallmark Channel has been criticized for editing its programming to remove what its Standards and Practices department considers offensive words. After the word \\"God\\" was muted in April 2014 from the film It Could Happen to You, in what is described as an attempt \\"to avoid taking His name in vain\\", the practice backfired when viewers interpreted the muting as evidence of hatred for the deity. Blogger Donna Cavanagh criticized the channel's content policies in July 2011, describing them as \\"censorship at its worst\\", with removal of profanities or epithets such as \\"ass\\" and \\"hooker\\". In response to Cavanagh's inquiry, a representative of the network wrote: Cavanagh accused the network of hypocrisy in deeming such material as being objectionable according to the network's standards, while continuing to acquire off-network sitcoms such as Frasier and The Golden Girls, which often feature sexual content including references to promiscuity. Others have recommended the channel's late night programming, while noting that the word removal from these programs \\"puts a mild damper on the fun.\\" International versions Hallmark Channel operated several cable channels in various international markets; they were sold in 2005 to Sparrowhawk Media, which was in turn acquired by Universal Networks International in 2007. Universal's licensing agreement ended in July 2011; the networks were either shut down, or rebranded under another NBC Universal-owned brand (such as Diva Universal, Studio Universal, 13th Street Universal or Universal Channel). In the United Kingdom, the Hallmark Original Movies originally shown on the channel are now shown on Movies 24, a sister to the Hallmark Channel. On October 25, 2018, Corus Entertainment announced that W Network would become the exclusive Canadian broadcaster of Hallmark Channel original series and films beginning November 1. The deal includes branded blocks and airings of the network's seasonal events; the programming deal officially launched with a Canadian version of the Countdown to Christmas event.

History ELA-STV publication from 1971 It was opposed to the influence of trade unions who appealed to a working class ethos (Socialist UGT and Anarchist CNT), advocating instead a Basque nationalist outlook. Initially, ELA-STV was centered on projects of mutual assistance between its affiliates, as a vehicle for social security. It expanded with much more success in Guip√∫zcoa and Biscay than in Navarre and √Ålava. ELA-STV was caught in the fighting of the Spanish Civil War, and banned by the Francoist State. It reemerged in 1976, during the transition to democracy. Today, it has over 105,000 members. In the 70's ELA abandoned its original social-christian ideology in favour of more socialist positions, recognizing the importance and validity of the class struggle, breaking with the Basque Nationalist Party and approaching LAB. In the General Congress of 1976 ELA-STV approved the new principles and rules of the union, which will become its identity: ELA was a Basque national and class union, independent from all political parties, open to all workers of Euskal Herria, economic independence (funding only through membership fees, not accepting public money), incompatibility of positions, confederal basis, creating a common resistance fund, international solidarity, etc. This line will be ratified and will gain further in the coming Congress. During transition ELA opposed the Moncloa Pacts. The pro-PNV and anti- socialist wing of the union split and formed Eusko Langillen Alkartasuna (Askatuta) ‚Äì Solidaridad de Trabajadores Vascos (Independiente) (ELA (a)-STV (i)), which would disappear in 1990.

Etymology The river was known to the Romans as the Itouna, as recorded by the Greek geographer Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) in the 2nd century AD. This name derives from the Celtic word ituna, meaning water,The Oxford Names Companion, Oxford University Press, Second edition 1998, 019860561-7 or rushing.Adrian Room, Dictionary of Place Names in the British Isles,Bloomsbury, 1988, 074750170-X Thus there is no relation to the biblical Garden of Eden. Course of river The Eden rises in Black Fell Moss, Mallerstang, on the high ground between High Seat, Yorkshire Dales and Hugh Seat. Here it forms the boundary between the counties of Cumbria and North Yorkshire. Two other great rivers arise in the same peat bogs here, within a kilometre of each other: the River Swale and River Ure. It starts life as Red Gill Beck, then becomes Hell Gill Beck, before turning north and joining with Ais Gill Beck to become the River Eden. (Hell Gill Force, just before it meets Ais Gill Beck, is the highest waterfall along its journey to the sea). The steep-sided dale of Mallerstang later opens out to become the Vale of Eden. The river flows through Kirkby Stephen and Appleby- in-Westmorland, and receives the water of many becks flowing off the Pennines to the east, and longer rivers from the Lakes off to the west, including the River Lyvennet, River Leith and River Eamont, which arrives via Ullswater and Penrith. Continuing north, it formed the eastern boundary of Inglewood Forest. It passes close to the ancient stone circle known as Long Meg and Her Daughters and through the sparsely populated beef and dairy farming regions of the vale of Cumbria on the Solway Plain. After flowing through Wetheral, where it is crossed by Corby Bridge, a Grade I listed railway viaduct of 1834, it merges with the River Irthing from the east, followed by the River Petteril and River Caldew from the south, as it winds through Carlisle. Its junction with the River Caldew in north Carlisle marks the point where Hadrian's Wall crosses the Eden, only five miles before both reach their end at the tidal flats. It enters the Solway Firth near the mouth of the River Esk after a total distance of approximately . Ecology The river supports Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra). The river and its tributaries are designated a Special Area of Conservation under the European Union's Habitats Directive. The area protected by the SAC includes Ullswater.

At it is the second-largest park in Seattle, after Discovery Park in Magnolia (which covers ). Magnuson Park is located at the site of the former Naval Station Puget Sound, on the Sand Point peninsula with Pontiac and Wolf bays that juts into Lake Washington in northeast Seattle. History =Early history= The area has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE--10,000 years ago). Prairie or tall grassland areas (anthropogenic grasslands) were maintained along what is now Sand Point Way NE (map ), among numerous locations in what is now Seattle. The Xacuab≈° (Xachua'bsh or hah-choo-AHBSH, \\"the People of the Large Lake\\", now of the Duwamish tribe) had the village of TLEHLS (\\"minnows\\" or \\"shiners\\") on the shores of what is now called Wolf Bay in Windermere, on Lake Washington south of SqWsEb, now called Sand Point-Magnuson Park. BEbqwa'bEks (\\"small prairie\\"-- anthropogenic grassland) was near what is now Windermere. One or three sizable longhouses have been documented. Villages were diffuse. These people may have been associated with the hloo-weelh-AHBSH of Union Bay. Just on the other side of Sand Point, the village of too-HOO-beed was of the too-oh-beh-DAHBSH extended family, near what is now called Thornton Creek at what is now Matthews Beach, so Sand Point was their shared \\"side yard\\".Dailey (2006-06-14) =Naval use= The first park at Sand Point was established in 1900 as Carkeek Park, a gift from developers Mr. and Mrs. Morgan J. Carkeek. After World War I, a movement was begun to build Naval Air Station (NAS) Seattle at Sand Point, and King County began acquiring surrounding parcels. In 1922 the U.S. Navy began construction on the site, which it was leasing from the county, and in 1926 the Navy was deeded the field outright. The name Carkeek Park was subsequently given to a new park on the west side of the city, north of Ballard on Puget Sound. This deed amounted to a public gift of $500,000 from the county to the Navy, in 1926 dollars; this would be $5,283,000 in 2005 dollars, not including significant real estate appreciation. The facility then became known Naval Air Station Sand Point. Naval Air Station Seattle was deactivated in 1970 and the airfield was shut down; the reduced base was renamed \\"Naval Support Activity Seattle.\\" Negotiations began as to who would receive the surplus property. =City park= In 1975 a large portion of the Navy's land was given to the City of Seattle and to the NOAA. The city's land was largely developed as a park and named Sand Point Park. In 1977, it was renamed Magnuson Park in honor of longtime U.S. Senator Warren Magnuson, a former naval officer from Seattle. Both names for the park are commonly used. The airfield runways were demolished in the late 1970s and new construction on the north end for the NOAA was completed in 1982. Geography The Sand Point peninsula on which Magnuson Park is located juts into Lake Washington between Wolf Bay and Pontiac Bay. As well as the park, the peninsula is occupied by parts of View Ridge and Windermere, and gives its name to the Sand Point neighborhood to the west. The easternmost point was formerly Naval Air Station-Sand Point; the old military base is now mostly public parkland. Other portions are occupied by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) western regional center and by city housing. Amenities The Fin Project, public art made from dive fins from former U.S. Navy submarines Parachute Practice at Magnuson Park in Seattle Magnuson Park today features several sports fields, a picnic area, a swimming beach, public sailboating, many paths for walking and bicycling, a dog park or off-leash dog area and \\"Kite Hill\\", a large grassy man-made hill constructed in the 1980s from earth and pavement pieces of the old airfield tarmac. Vehicle access includes boat launch ramps and large parking lots for cars, trucks, and boat trailers. The park also has a history of unofficial clothing-optional use since the mid-1970s. =Sports fields= The Sports Meadow, a natural grass athletic field area, was developed in the early 1980s near the center of the former main runway. Rebuilt in 2004-05 and raised nearly eight feet to improve drainage, it is now divided into four unlit soccer fields. As of 2005, the City of Seattle had a development plan that featured a large sports field complex of approximately ten fields, with seven well lit. The plan had encountered opposition from neighborhood groups, environmental and park advocates. The plan was amended to five new athletic fields with an engineered wetlands area, with additional pavement areas removed and construction of new walking trails. Opened in April 2009 southeast of the Meadow area, the first three fields (all lit with synthetic turf) are primarily for rugby (field # 5, lit) and soccer (# 6, 7, both lit). Later in the year the baseball field (# 8, unlit) and softball field (# 9) to the south were completed, but were not opened until late 2010 to allow the natural grass outfields to mature. Runoff from the athletic fields feeds the wetlands area and restrictions on lighting were enacted; no late nights or Sundays. =Wetland restoration= Wetlands in June 2012, three years after construction Sand Point provides habitat for the second richest bird habitat of any park in Seattle, with 170 species reported including pine siskins, Anna's hummingbirds, and black-capped chickadees. Wildlife diversity has been improved in part by a wetlands restoration project that radically transformed the park's landscape and hydrology. Sand Point was substantially regraded during construction of the naval air station. Existing marshlands were eliminated with fill or paved over and the point's natural slope was flattened. Runoff was channeled into storm drains, and around 20% of the park's surface was rendered impervious with concrete and asphalt. As the storm drains aged, they became less effective at channeling water to the lake, leading to an increase in sheet flow runoff and over-saturation of the park's sports fields. The irregular runoff patterns also resulted in substantial volume of untreated water draining into Lake Washington. The Wetlands Restoration project created a set of mounds, plateaus, valleys, and ponds to channel water more effectively and improve drainage of over-saturated areas. This constructed wetland provides natural filtration of urban drainage water and reduces pollution in Lake Washington. Part of the wetlands project included the removal of the parking lot at the south end of the Sports Meadow and the demolition of Building 193 at the south end of the park. Built in 1943 as a hangar for transport aircraft, it was later the base's commissary and exchange; it was removed in December 2006. of wetlands, including walking paths and observation points, were completed in 2009. The next phase of wetland restoration was completed in late 2011. =Playground= Magnuson Park is home to Seattle's biggest playground, the Junior League of Seattle Children's Playground which was designed, developed and funded through the efforts of the Junior League of Seattle, a women's leadership and volunteer organization. Opened in 1999 and spearheaded by prominent Seattle resident, Mary Herche, the Playground celebrated its 10th anniversary on May 16, 2009, where children played in the of colorful climbing walls, sand box, swings, slides and much more. The Junior League of Seattle donated and dedicated this \\"Air, Land and Sea\\" playground to the children of Seattle to commemorate the organization's 75 years of community service. The playground was designed partly by children and built entirely by volunteers at the site of the former Naval Air Station Control Tower.

It has been part of the city of Wolverhampton, West Midlands since 1966, when the majority of Wednesfield was incorporated into Wolverhampton. It constitutes mostly of the Wednesfield North ward of the Wolverhampton council. History Ashmore Park was initially one of the wooded estates Lady Wulfruna transferred to St. Peter's Fold to allow the park to generate income and food. A moat-surrounded farmhouse was built here sometime during the mid-14th century. Three-quarters of the moat still exists today in the \\"bottom shops\\" precinct. The housing estate, built as an overspill estate for Wolverhampton, was constructed within the Wednesfield Urban District. The estate consists predominantly of council houses, flats, and bungalows from the 1950s. The Dean of Wolverhampton probably used the homestead in his role as Dean (landlord) of Ashmore Park. The original farmhouse was removed when a new one was built in the early 19th century. In 1957 authorities demolished that farmhouse and built a library near its site. Demographics According to the 2001 United Kingdom census, Ashmore Park had a total population of 6,734. Of these, 27.6% of its residents were between the ages of 25-44 years old, while 24.3% reported being between the ages of 60-74. The neighbourhood is not ethnically diverse, with 97.4% of its residents classified as Caucasian; the largest ethnic minority group is Black Caribbean, representing just 0.9% of the population. 54.5% of the 2,968 households in the neighbourhood were owner-occupied, while 39.4% of homes were council houses. Ashmore Park had an unemployment rate of 7.1%, ranking above the Wolverhampton average of 5.3%. Of those identified as economically inactive, 24.4% were retired. And of all households in the neighbourhood, only 11.1% were not considered deprived at all, while 7.2% were overcrowded. Christianity is the area's predominant religion, with 81.6% of the population identifying as Christian. 9.4% of residents reported that they did not have a religious affinity. Education At the time of construction, Ashmore Park was served by two schools: Ashmore Park County Primary School and Danesmore Primary School. Both have since been demolished. Today a secondary school, Coppice Performing Arts School, serves the estate, with three primary schools: Oak Meadow Primary School, Corpus Christi Catholic School, and St. Alban's Primary School. Places of interest At the heart of the estate is a large green park consisting of a children's play area and several sports facilities, including a skate park, multi-sports pitch, BMX track, and bowling green. The park is also home to the Wednesfield Aces and Wednesfield Dragons cycle speedway teams. The park was built on top of a slag heap left over from mining activity in the area. There are two main shopping areas, known locally as the \\"top\\" and \\"bottom\\" shops due to their geographic location. The \\"bottom shop\\" precinct houses a mix of local and independent businesses and underwent an extensive facelift during the early 2000s that included work to preserve the historic moat site. In 2014 a revamped community centre opened called The Hub at Ashmore Park with many facilities for the local community to use. The library which was located next to the \\"bottom shops\\" shopping precinct was closed and merged into the hub, whilst many other libraries were closed or had reduced opening hours in Wolverhampton. There are two public houses and a social club on the estate: The True Briton, The Ashmore Inn and Corpus Christi Social Club. In 2014 more than 350 members of the local community signed a petition to save The Ashmore Inn public house from being closed and turned into a retail store. The petition succeeded in having The Ashmore Inn listed as an Asset of Community Value. In 2016 a Coop Food convience store and Tanning Salon were opened on adjacent land sharing the car park with the public house, whilst the bookmakers previously there moved to the \\"bottom shops\\" shopping precinct. Transport =Trains= Ashmore Park is served by West Midland Trains that run approximately on an hourly basis. The nearest train stations to Ashmore Park are Bloxwich North, Bloxwich, and Wolverhampton. There was a railway station named ‚ÄúLinthouse Crossway‚Äù on the west side of the estate, until 1890. There is nothing left of the old station, as the site is now part of wheat fields. =Buses= Several bus services serve Ashmore Park, including the 57, 59, and 69 lines. The 59 bus, which is operated by National Express West Midlands, runs the most frequent service. It provides regular access to the estate from Wolverhampton via Heath Town, New Cross Hospital and Wednesfield roughly every six minutes during the day (Monday-Saturday) and every 12 minutes in the evenings, on Sundays, and bank holidays. The 69 bus, also operated by National Express West Midlands, provides service to the lower zone of the estate between Wolverhampton and Walsall via Heath Town, New Cross Hospital, Wood End, Coppice Farm, New Invention, Beechdale, and Reedswood Retail Park. This service operates every 30 minutes during the day (Monday-Saturday) and hourly during the day on Sunday. Similar to the 69 bus the 57 bus service, operated by Diamond West Midlands (Rotala), serves the lower zone of the estate. It runs from Wolverhampton to Bilston via Heath Town, Park Village, Wednesfield, Wood End, Lyndale Park, and Willenhall. Hourly service operates during the daytime, Monday-Saturday.

Nutrient management is the science and practice directed to link soil, crop, weather, and hydrologic factors with cultural, irrigation, and soil and water conservation practices to achieve optimal nutrient use efficiency, crop yields, crop quality, and economic returns, while reducing off-site transport of nutrients (fertilizer) that may impact the environment.Delgado and Lemunyon. ‚ÄúNutrient Management.‚Äù In Encyclopedia of Soil Science (Vol 2). Ed. Rattan Lal. CRC Press, 2006. pp 1157 ‚Äì 1160. It involves matching a specific field soil, climate, and crop management conditions to rate, source, timing, and place (commonly known as the 4R nutrient stewardship) of nutrient application.4R Nutrient Stewardship Important factors that need to be considered when managing nutrients include (a) the application of nutrients considering the achievable optimum yields and, in some cases, crop quality; (b) the management, application, and timing of nutrients using a budget based on all sources and sinks active at the site; and (c) the management of soil, water, and crop to minimize the off-site transport of nutrients from nutrient leaching out of the root zone, surface runoff, and volatilization (or other gas exchanges). There can be potential interactions because of differences in nutrient pathways and dynamics. For instance, practices that reduce the off-site surface transport of a given nutrient may increase the leaching losses of other nutrients. These complex dynamics present nutrient managers the difficult task of achieve the best balance for maximizing profit while contributing to the conservation of our biosphere. Nutrient management plan Manure spreader A crop nutrient management plan is a tool that farmers can use to increase the efficiency of all the nutrient sources a crop uses while reducing production and environmental risk, ultimately increasing profit. Increasingly, growers as well as agronomists use digital tools like SST or Agworld to create their nutrient management plan so they can capitalize on information gathered over a number of years.https://www.precisionag.com/digital-farming/the-digital-farm- how-precision-technologies-are-helping-farmers-increase-profitability-meet- demand-for-nutritious-calories/ It is generally agreed that there are ten fundamental components of a Crop Nutrient Management Plan. Each component is critical to helping analyze each field and improve nutrient efficiency for the crops grown. These components include:Nutrient Management Planning: An Overview ;Field map: The map, including general reference points (such as streams, residences, wellheads etc.), number of acres, and soil types is the base for the rest of the plan. ;Soil test: How much of each nutrient (N-P-K and other critical elements such as pH and organic matter) is in the soil profile? The soil test is a key component needed for developing the nutrient rate recommendation. ;Crop sequence: Did the crop that grew in the field last year (and in many cases two or more years ago) fix nitrogen for use in the following years? Has long-term no-till increased organic matter? Did the end- of-season stalk test show a nutrient deficiency? These factors also need to be factored into the plan. ;Estimated yield: Factors that affect yield are numerous and complex. A field's soils, drainage, insect, weed and crop disease pressure, rotation and many other factors differentiate one field from another. This is why using historic yields is important in developing yield estimates for next year. Accurate yield estimates can improve nutrient use efficiency. ;Sources and forms: The sources and forms of available nutrients can vary from farm-to-farm and even field-to-field. For instance, manure fertility analysis, storage practices and other factors will need to be included in a nutrient management plan. Manure nutrient tests/analysis are one way to determine the fertility of it. Nitrogen fixed from a previous year's legume crop and residual effects of manure also affects rate recommendations. Many other nutrient sources should also be factored into this plan. ;Sensitive areas: What's out of the ordinary about a field's plan? Is it irrigated? Next to a stream or lake? Especially sandy in one area? Steep slope or low area? Manure applied in one area for generations due to proximity of dairy barn? Extremely productive‚Äîor unproductive‚Äîin a portion of the field? Are there buffers that protect streams, drainage ditches, wellheads, and other water collection points? How far away are the neighbors? What's the general wind direction? This is the place to note these and other special conditions that need to be considered. ;Recommended rates: Here's the place where science, technology, and art meet. Given everything you've noted, what is the optimum rate of N, P, K, lime and any other nutrients? While science tells us that a crop has changing nutrient requirements during the growing season, a combination of technology and farmer's management skills assure nutrient availability at all stages of growth. No-till corn generally requires starter fertilizer to give the seedling a healthy start. ;Recommended timing: When does the soil temperature drop below 50 degrees? Will a N stabilizer be used? What's the tillage practice? Strip-till corn and no-till often require different timing approaches than seed planted into a field that's been tilled once with a field cultivator. Will a starter fertilizer be used to give the seedling a healthy start? How many acres can be covered with available labor (custom or hired) and equipment? Does manure application in a farm depend on a custom applicator's schedule? What agreements have been worked out with neighbors for manure use on their fields? Is a neighbor hosting a special event? All these factors and more will likely figure into the recommended timing. ;Recommended methods: Surface or injected? While injection is clearly preferred, there may be situations where injection is not feasible (i.e. pasture, grassland). Slope, rainfall patterns, soil type, crop rotation and many other factors determine which method is best for optimizing nutrient efficiency (availability and loss) in farms. The combination that's right in one field may differ in another field even with the same crop. ;Annual review and update: Even the best managers are forced to deviate from their plans. What rate was actually applied? Where? Using which method? Did an unusually mild winter or wet spring reduce soil nitrate? Did a dry summer, disease, or some other unusual factor increase nutrient carryover? These and other factors should be noted as they occur. When such a plan is designed for animal feeding operations (AFO), it may be termed a \\"manure management plan.\\" In the United States, some regulatory agencies recommend or require that farms implement these plans in order to prevent water pollution. The U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has published guidance documents on preparing a comprehensive nutrient management plan (CNMP) for AFOs.NRCS.

December 2000. The International Plant Nutrition Institute has published a 4R plant nutrition manual for improving the management of plant nutrition. The manual outlines the scientific principles behind each of the four R's or ‚Äúrights‚Äù (right source of nutrient, right application rate, right time, right place) and discusses the adoption of 4R practices on the farm, approaches to nutrient management planning, and measurement of sustainability performance.4R Plant Nutrition Manual Nitrogen management Of the 16 essential plant nutrients, nitrogen is usually the most difficult to manage in field crop systems. This is because the quantity of plant-available nitrogen can change rapidly in response to changes in soil water status. Nitrogen can be lost from the plant-soil system by one or more of the following processes: leaching; surface runoff; soil erosion; ammonia volatilization; and denitrification. =Nitrogen Management Practices that Improve Nitrogen Efficiency= Nitrogen management aims to maximize the efficiency with which crops use applied N. Improvements in nitrogen use efficiency are associated with decreases in N loss from the soil. Although losses cannot be avoided completely, significant improvements can be realized by applying one or more of the following management practices in the cropping system. =Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions= * Climate Smart Agriculture includes the use of 4R Nutrient Stewardship principles to reduce field emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from the application of nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrogen fertilizer is an important driver of nitrous oxide emissions, but it is also the main driver of yield in modern high production systems. Through careful selection of nitrogen fertilizer source, rate, timing and placement practices, the nitrous oxide emissions per unit of crop produced can be substantially reduced, in some cases by up to half. The practices that reduce nitrous oxide emissions also tend to increase nitrogen use efficiency and the economic return on fertilizer dollars. Reduction of N loss in runoff water and eroded soil * No- till, conservation tillage and other runoff control measures reduce N loss in surface runoff and eroded soil material. * The use of daily estimates of soil moisture and crop needs to schedule irrigation reduces the risk of surface runoff and soil erosion. Reduction of the volatilization of N as ammonia gas * Incorporation and/or injection of urea and ammonium-containing fertilizers decreases ammonia volatilization because good soil contact buffers pH and slows the generation of ammonia gas from ammonium ions. * Urease inhibitors temporarily block the function of the urease enzyme, maintaining urea-based fertilizers in the non-volatile urea form, reducing volatilization losses when these fertilizers are surface applied; these losses can be meaningful in high-residue, conservation tillage systems. Prevention of the build-up of high soil nitrate concentrations Nitrate is the form of nitrogen that is most susceptible to loss from the soil, through denitrification and leaching. The amount of N lost via these processes can be limited by restricting soil nitrate concentrations, especially at times of high risk. This can be done in many ways, although these are not always cost- effective. =Nitrogen Rates= Rates of N application should be high enough to maximize profits in the long term and minimize residual (unused) nitrate in the soil after harvest. * The use of local research to determine recommended nitrogen application rates should result in appropriate N rates. * Recommended N application rates often rely on an assessment of yield expectations - these should be realistic, and preferably based on accurate yield records. * Fertilizer N rates should be corrected for N that is likely to be mineralized from soil organic matter and crop residues (especially legume residues). * Fertilizer N rates should allow for N applied in manure, in irrigation water, and from atmospheric deposition. * Where feasible, appropriate soil tests can be used to determine residual soil N. =Soil Testing for N= * Preplant soil tests provide information on the soil's N-supply power. * Late spring or pre-side-dress N tests can determine if and how much additional N is needed. * New soil test and sampling procedures, such as amino sugar tests, grid mapping, and real-time sensors can refine N requirements. * Post-harvest soil tests determine if N management the previous season was appropriate. =Crop Testing for N= * Plant tissue tests can identify N deficiencies. * Sensing variations in plant chlorophyll content facilitates variable rate N applications in-season. * Post-black-layer corn stalk nitrate tests help to determine if N rates were low, optimal, or excessive in the previous crop, so that management changes can be made in following crops. =Precision agriculture= * Variable rate applicators, combined with intensive soil or crop sampling, allow more precise and responsive application rates. =Timing of N Applications= * Apply N close to the time when crops can utilize it. * Make side-dress N applications close to the time of most rapid N uptake. * Split applications, involving more than one application, allow efficient use of applied N and reduce the risk of N loss to the environment. =N Forms, including Slow or Controlled Release Fertilizers and Inhibitors= * Slow or controlled release fertilizer delays the availability of nitrogen to the plant until a time that is more appropriate for plant uptake - the risk of N loss through denitrification and leaching is reduced by limiting nitrate concentrations in the soil. * Nitrification inhibitors maintain applied N in the ammonium form for a longer period of time, thereby reducing leaching and denitrification losses. =N capture= * Particular crop varieties are able to more efficiently extract N from the soil and improve N use efficiency. Breeding of crops for efficient N uptake is in progress. * Rotation with deep-rooted crops helps capture nitrates deeper in the soil profile. * Cover crops capture residual nitrogen after crop harvest and recycle it as plant biomass. * Elimination of restrictions to subsoil root development; subsoil compaction and subsoil acidity prevent root penetration in many subsoils worldwide, promoting build- up of subsoil nitrate concentrations which are susceptible to denitrification and leaching when conditions are suitable. * Good agronomic practice, including appropriate plant populations and spacing and good weed and pest management, allows crops to produce large root systems to optimise N capture and crop yield. Water management =Conservation tillage= * Conservation tillage optimizes soil moisture conditions that improve water use efficiency; in water-stressed conditions, this improves crop yield per unit N applied. =N Fertilizer Application Method and Placement= * In ridged crops, placing N fertilizers in a band in ridges makes N less susceptible to leaching. * Row fertilizer applicators, such as injectors, which form a compacted soil layer and surface ridge, can reduce N losses by diverting water flow. =Good irrigation management can dramatically improve N-use efficiency= * Scheduled irrigation based on soil moisture estimates and daily crop needs will improve both water-use and N-use efficiency. * Sprinkler irrigation systems apply water more uniformly and in lower amounts than furrow or basin irrigation systems. * Furrow irrigation efficiency can be improved by adjusting set time, stream size, furrow length, watering every other row, or the use of surge valves. * Alternate row irrigation and fertilization minimizes water contact with nutrients. * Application of N fertilizer through irrigation systems (fertigation) facilitates N supply when crop demand is greatest. * Polyacrylamide (PAM) treatment during furrow irrigation reduces sediment and N losses. =Drainage Systems= * Some subirrigation systems recycle nitrate leached from the soil profile and reduce nitrate lost in drainage water. * Excessive drainage can lead to rapid through-flow of water and N leaching, but restricted or insufficient drainage favors anaerobic conditions and denitrification. Use of simulation models Short-term changes in the plant-available N status make accurate seasonal predictions of crop N requirement difficult in most situations. However, models (such as NLEAP and Adapt-N) that use soil, weather, crop, and field management data can be updated with day-to-day changes and thereby improve predictions of the fate of applied N. They allows farmers to make adaptive management decisions that can improve N-use efficiency and minimize N losses and environmental impact while maximizing profitability. =Additional measures to minimize environmental impact= Conservation Buffers * Buffers trap sediment containing ammonia and organic N. * Nitrate in subsurface flow is reduced through denitrification enhanced by carbon energy sources contained in the soil associated with buffer vegetation. * Buffer vegetation takes up nitrogen, other nutrients, and reduces loss to water. Constructed Wetlands * Constructed wetlands located strategically on the landscape to process drainage effluent reduces sediment and nitrate loads to surface water.

The name is recorded as Ard or Arden in early references.Edmund Gosse, 1756, The Life of John Buncle, Esq., J. Noon, London For the first 15 miles of its course it defines the border between Northumberland and Cumbria.Ordnance Survey Outdoor Leisure 43, 1997, 1:25000  Etymology  The name Irthing may be of Brittonic origin, though its precise etymology is uncertain. The last part of the name is from ‚Äì√Ønn, an adjectival and, in place-names, toponymic suffix, added to nouns or adjectives. The first part may be arth, meaning \\"a bear\\" (c.f. Welsh arth). Or else, the first part of the name could either one of two elements suffixed with -ed, an early Celtic nominal suffix meaning \\"having the quality of..\\". The first of these is, *ar, an ancient river-naming element implying either horizontal motion, \\"flowing\\", or else \\"rising\\" or \\"springing up\\" (compare Irt). The second possibility is *ƒ´r, meaning \\"fresh, clean, pure\\".  Geography  It is thought that before the last glacial maximum the Irthing flowed into the South Tyne valley through the watershed near Greenhead, now known as the Tyne Gap. This section of the valley is now blocked by a filling of glacial till, diverting the river south west, but the old course has been detected by drilling and echo-sounding.Lunn, A.G., 1988, Glacial drift thickness in the Tyne Gap, Northumberland : Transactions of the Natural History Society of Northumbria 55(1) p.20-27 The rapidly eroding cliffs threatening the southern edge of Birdoswald Roman Fort and the fact that the Roman bridge abutment at Willowford is now 44 m (144.4 ft)Measured by W. Higgs 5 August 2012 from the river testify to the instability of the local landscape as it continues to recover from glacial alteration. The river rises on Paddaburn Moor in Kielder Forest and skirts the eastern edge of Butterburn Flow raised bog. Remains of numerous mediaeval shielings have been found along the banks of these upper reaches,Ramm, McDowell & Mercer, 1970, Shielings and Bastles, HMSO some of which have been given ancient monument status. For two miles above the village of Gilsland the river flows through the Irthing Gorge , flanked by mainly sandstone crags. Within the upper section of this gorge lies the spectacular 7.6 metre (25 feet) Crammel Linn waterfall. Peregrine falcons and ravens nest near the waterfall and derelict military structures, probably pump-houses supplying water for the Blue Streak rocket site at RAF Spadeadam, can be seen just upstream. Further downstream, in the grounds of Gilsland Spa hotel, the crags develop into high cliffs. The cliff face below the hotel gives rise to the famous sulphurous spring after which the hotel is named and also a chalybeate spring and a petrifying seep. Hadrian's Wall crossed the river on a bridge at Willowford, 0.75 kilometres (0.5 miles) east of Birdoswald Roman Fort. From that point the course of the river as it turns west is lined with other Roman sites associated with the Roman Stanegate road and Hadrian's Wall. A 914-metre (2,998.7 feet) stretch of Wall, including two turrets and the impressive bridge remains, runs alongside the River Irthing at Willowford, linked by a new footbridge to Birdoswald Roman Fort. This crossing of the River Irthing marked a significant transition in the construction of Hadrian's Wall, emphasising the greater availability of building stone to the east. Passing Brampton the Irthing merges with the River Gelt, and soon after meets the River Eden near Warwick Bridge, just north of Wetheral.

Lindemann was a brilliant but arrogant intellectual, who quarrelled sharply with many respected advisers. His contribution to Allied victory lay chiefly in logistics. He was particularly adept at converting data into clear charts to promote a strategy. But despite his credentials, his judgment about technology was often flawed. He tried to block the development of radar in favour of infra-red beams. He discounted the first reports of the enemy's V-weapons programme. He pressed the case for the strategic area bombing of cities on a false premise about the impact of such bombing on civilian morale. His abiding influence on Churchill stemmed from close personal friendship, as a member of the latter's country-house set, including Evelyn Waugh, the Mitfords and the Sitwells. In Churchill's second government, he was given a seat in the cabinet, and later created Viscount Cherwell of Oxford. Early life, family and personality Lindemann was the second of three sons of Adolph Friedrich Lindemann, who had emigrated to the United Kingdom circa 1871 and became naturalised. ‚Äì See especially p. 343. Frederick was born in Baden-Baden in Germany where his American mother Olga Noble, the widow of a wealthy banker, was taking \\"the cure\\". After schooling in Scotland and Darmstadt, he attended the University of Berlin. He carried out research in physics at the Sorbonne that confirmed theories, first put forward by Albert Einstein, on specific heats at very low temperatures. For this and other scientific work, Lindemann was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1920. In 1911 he was invited to the Solvay Conference on \\"Radiation and the Quanta\\" where he was the youngest attendee. He was known to friends as \\"the Prof\\" in reference to his position at the University of Oxford, and as \\"Baron Berlin\\" to his many detractors because of his German accent and haughty aristocratic manner. Lindemann believed that a small circle of the intelligent and the aristocratic should run the world, resulting in a peaceable and stable society, \\"led by supermen and served by helots.\\" Some sources claim that he was Jewish,Oxford Jewish Personalities, Oxford Chabad Society. but Frederick Smith's biography and David Irving's second book on Churchill declare that he was not. Lindemann supported eugenics and held the working class, homosexuals, and blacks in contempt and supported sterilisation of the mentally incompetent. He believed ‚Äî Mukerjee concludes, referring to Lindemann's lecture on Eugenics ‚Äî that Science could yield a race of humans blessed with 'the mental make-up of the worker bee' ... At the lower end of the race and class spectrum, one could remove the ability to suffer or to feel ambition ... Instead of subscribing to what he called 'the fetish of equality', Lindemann recommended that human differences should be accepted and indeed enhanced by means of science. It was no longer necessary, he wrote, to wait for 'the haphazard process of natural selection to ensure that the slow and heavy mind gravitates to the lowest form of activity.' First World War and the University of Oxford At the outbreak of the First World War, Lindemann was playing tennis in Germany and had to leave in haste to avoid internment. In 1915, he joined the staff of the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough. He developed a mathematical theory of aircraft spin recovery, and later learned to fly so that he could test his ideas himself. Prior to Lindemann's work, a spinning aircraft was almost invariably unrecoverable and the result to the pilot fatal. In 1919 Lindemann was appointed professor of experimental philosophy (physics) at the University of Oxford and director of the Clarendon Laboratory, largely on the recommendation of Henry Tizard who had been a colleague in Berlin. Also in 1919, he was one of the first people to suggest that an electrically neutral wind of positively charged protons and electrons is emitted from the Sun. He might have been unaware that Kristian Birkeland had speculated three years earlier that the solar wind might be a mixture of positively and negatively charged particles. At the same time he worked on the theory of specific heats and on temperature inversion in the stratosphere, and began to bring the two scientific disciplines together.Keith J. Laidler, Chemical Kinetics (3rd ed., Harper and Row 1987), , p. 506. In the field of chemical kinetics, he proposed the Lindemann mechanism in 1921 for unimolecular chemical reactions, and showed that the first step is one of bimolecular activation. Around this time, Churchill's wife Clementine partnered with Lindemann for a charity tennis match. Although the two men had very different lifestyles, they both excelled at a sport: Churchill's was polo. Lindemann's ability to explain scientific issues concisely, and his excellent flying skills, probably impressed Churchill, who had given up trying to earn a pilot's licence because of Clementine's grave concerns. They became close friends and remained so for 35 years, with Lindemann visiting Chartwell more than 100 times from 1925 to 1939. Lindemann opposed the General Strike of 1926, and mobilised the reluctant staff of the Clarendon to produce copies of Churchill's anti-strike newspaper, the British Gazette. Lindemann was also alarmed and fearful of political developments in Germany. In the 1930s, Lindemann advised Winston Churchill when the latter was out of Government ‚Äì the Wilderness Years ‚Äì and leading a campaign for rearmament. He appointed to the Clarendon one of Churchill's social set that included the Mitfords and the Cavendish family, the young Welshman Derek Jackson. This brilliant young physicist, the son of Sir Charles Jackson, transferred from the Nobel prize- winning labs at Cambridge and worked on Lindemann's top-secret nuclear energy projects. Lindemann moved in rich circles at Biddesden, the Earl of Iveagh's home, hosted with literary luminaries Augustus John, Lytton Strachey, John Betjeman, Evelyn Waugh, the Carringtons and the Mitfords, the Sitwells and the Huxley families. One frequently intoxicated visitor was a wayward Randolph Churchill. In 1932, Lindemann joined Winston to complete a road trip throughout Europe and were dismayed at what they saw. Churchill later said, \\"A terrible process is astir. Germany is arming.\\" Lindemann was prevailed upon to release Jackson in 1940 to join the RAF; Jackson flew in the Battle of Britain and won a DFC. Lindemann also assisted the new Prime Minister in the rescue of a number of German Jewish physicists, primarily at the University of G√∂ttingen, to emigrate to Britain supplementing the vital war work developing at the Clarendon Laboratory, including the Manhattan Project. Churchill got Lindemann onto the \\"Committee for the Study of Aerial Defence\\" which under Sir Henry Tizard was putting its resources behind the development of radar. Lindemann's presence was disruptive, insisting instead that his own ideas of aerial mines and infra-red beams be given priority over radar. To resolve the situation the committee dissolved itself to reform as a new body without Lindemann.Hastings, Bomber Command, Pan 1999, pp. 155‚Äì156. He stayed in close contact with the Jacksons at Rignell Farm, who enriched a poor wartime diet with dairy products they brought into Oxford themselves.Alexander, The Other Mitford, pp. 79, 82. Second World War Phillips watching a demonstration at Holt, Norfolk When Churchill became Prime Minister, he appointed Lindemann as the British government's leading scientific adviser, with David Bensusan- Butt as his private secretary. ‚Äì See p. 237. Lindemann attended meetings of the War Cabinet, accompanied the prime minister on conferences abroad, and sent him an average of one missive a day. He saw Churchill almost daily for the duration of the war and wielded more influence than any other civilian adviser. He would hold this office again for the first two years of Churchill's peacetime administration (1951-5Fort, p. 318.). Lindemann established a special statistical branch, known as 'S-Branch', within the government, constituted from subject specialists, and reporting directly to Churchill. This branch scrutinised the performance of the regular ministries and prioritised the logistical machinery of warfare. S-Branch distilled thousands of sources of data into succinct charts and figures, so that the status of the nation's food supplies (for example) could be instantly evaluated. The bar charts now on display in the Cabinet War Rooms which compare Allied shipping tonnage lost to new ships delivered each month and those comparing bomb tonnage dropped by Germany on Britain with that dropped by the Allies on Germany each month are mute testaments to both the intellectual and the psychological power of his statistical presentations. Lindemann's statistical branch often caused tensions between government departments, but because it allowed Churchill to make quick decisions based on accurate data which directly affected the war effort, its importance should not be underestimated. In 1940, Lindemann supported the experimental department MD1. He worked on hollow charge weapons, the sticky bomb and other new weapons. General Ismay, who supervised MD1, recalled: With power, Lindemann was able to sideline Tizard; especially after Tizard did not acknowledge that the Germans were using radio navigation to bomb Britain. Lindemann has been described as having \\"an almost pathological hatred for Nazi Germany, and an almost medieval desire for revenge was a part of his character\\". ‚Äì See p. 179. Fearing food shortages in Britain, he convinced Churchill to divert 56 percent of the British merchant ships operating in the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic, a move that added two million tons of wheat as well as raw materials for war fighting to stocks in Britain The Ministry of War Transport warned that such dramatic cuts to shipping capacity in South East Asia would \\"portend violent changes and perhaps cataclysms in the seaborne trade of large numbers of countries\\" but the Ministry was ignored. The \\"menace of famine suddenly loomed up like a hydra-headed monster with a hundred clamouring mouths\\" according to C. B. A. Behrens in the official history of wartime British shipping. It has been estimated between 1.5 and 4 million people died during the Bengal famine of 1943, while Britain's stocks of food and raw materials by the end of 1943 were a record 18.5 million tons. Cherwell and Churchill's policies contributed heavily to the severity of the famine. Other British colonies on the Indian Ocean, including Kenya, Tanganyika and British Somaliland, also suffered famine that year. =Strategic bombing= Following the Air Ministry Area bombing directive on 12 February 1942, Lindemann presented in a paper on \\"Dehousing\\" to Churchill on 30 March 1942, which calculated the effects of area bombardment by a massive bomber force on German cities to break the spirit of the people. His proposal that \\"bombing must be directed to working class houses. Middle class houses have too much space round them, so are bound to waste bombs\\" changed accepted conventions of limiting civilian casualties in wartime\\". His dehousing paper was criticised by many other scientific minds in government service who felt such a force would be a waste of resources.Hastings, pp. 153‚Äì159. Lindemann's paper was based on the false premise that bombing could cause a breakdown in society but was used in support of Bomber Command's claim for resources.Hastings, p. 159.Malcolm Gladwell, Revisionist History. The Prime Minister and the Prof, 2017 .Secrets of World War II episode 5: The Bruneval Raid. Lindemann played an important part in the battle of the beams, championing countermeasures against German radio navigation devices to increase the precision of their bombing campaigns. Lindemann undermined the vital work of Sir Henry Tizard and his team who developed all the important radar technology. =V-2 rocket= Lindemann argued against the rumoured existence of the V-2 rocket, asserting it was \\"a great hoax to distract our attention from some other weapon.\\" He mistakenly concluded that \\"to put a four-thousand horsepower turbine in a twenty-inch space is lunacy: it couldn't be done, Mr. Lubbock\\" and that at the end of the war, the committee would find that the rocket was \\"a mare's nest\\". NOTE: Macrae's 1971 p. 170 absolute claim that \\"Prof certainly never suggested that nothing need be done about the V weapons; on the contrary he was always urging us to try to think up some brilliant counter measure against it which we were unable to do.\\" differs with the official records (meeting minutes, etc.) that indicate otherwise.p. 159 Lindemann took the view that long-range military rockets were feasible only if they were propelled by solid fuels and would need to be of enormous size. He rejected arguments that relatively compact liquid fuels could be used to propel such weapons.John Keegan, \\"Intelligence in War, , p. 180. In fairness, \\"Cherwell [Lindemann] had strong scientific grounds for doubting the forecasts that were being made of a 70‚Äì80 ton rocket with a 10 ton warhead\\". A pivotal exchange where Churchill rebuffed Lindemann occurred at the Cabinet Defence Committee (Operations) meeting on 29 June 1943 and was dramatised in the film Operation Crossbow. Political career Lindemann's political career was a result of his close friendship with Winston Churchill, who protected Lindemann from the many in Government he had snubbed and insulted. \\"Love me, love my dog, and if you don't love my dog, you damn well can't love me,\\" Churchill reportedly said to a member of Parliament who had questioned his reliance on Lindemann, and later to the same MP Churchill added, \\"Don't you know that he is one of my oldest and greatest friends?\\". In July 1941 Lindemann was raised to the peerage as Baron Cherwell, of Oxford in the County of Oxford. The following year he was made Paymaster- General by Churchill, an office he retained until 1945. In 1943 he was also sworn of the Privy Council. When Churchill returned as Prime Minister in 1951, Lindemann was once again appointed Paymaster-General, this time with a seat in the cabinet. He continued in this post until 1953. In 1956 he was made Viscount Cherwell of Oxford, in the County of Oxford. Personal life Lindemann was a teetotaler, non-smoker and a vegetarian, although Churchill would sometimes induce him to take a glass of brandy. He was an excellent pianist, and sufficiently able as a tennis player to compete at Wimbledon. Lindemann died in his sleep on 3 July 1957, aged 71, only a year after becoming Viscount Cherwell, at which point the barony and viscountcy became extinct. He was the first and last Viscount Cherwell.thepeerage.com Honours *4 June 1941: Raised to the peerage as Baron Cherwell *1943: Appointed a Privy Counsellor *1953: Companion of Honour *1956: Created Viscount Cherwell *1956: Hughes Medal See also * Lindemann Building of the Clarendon Laboratory in Oxford * Operation Biting ‚Äì the Bruneval Raid (1942) Notes References Bibliography ‚Äì secondary sources * Obituary: The Times, 4 July 1957 * Obituary: Nature 180, 579‚Äì581. * The London Gazette   (Lord Cherwell's role in the Bengal famine of 1943) * * For the Nernst- Lindemann melting point equation. * External links * \\"The Prime Minister and the Prof\\", episode of Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Revisionist History\\" podcast, report on history of Churchill, Lindemann, and historian Madhusree Mukerjee's review of their role in the Bengal famine of 1943 and Strategic bombing (Accessed 2017.07.17) * The most powerful scientist ever Scientific American, Madhusree Mukerjee, August, 2010.

Early life Jose Silva was born in Laredo, Texas. He and his older sister and younger brother were raised by their grandmother. Silva supported the family from the age of 6 by selling newspapers, shining shoes, and doing odd jobs. He never attended school as a student, but learned to read and write by watching his sister and brother do their homework. Silva was able to study a correspondence course on radio repair through an agreement with the town barber, under which the barber rented the lessons to Silva, and Silva earned the diploma in the barber's name. At the age of fifteen, Silva began to repair radios and built a successful business which he maintained for the next 40 years, interrupted only by military service. World War II service During World War II, Silva joined the Signal Corps. At his induction, he was examined by an Army psychiatrist. Intrigued by the psychiatrist's odd questions, Silva inquired about a book on hypnosis that was sitting on the psychiatrist's bookshelf. As a result, Silva began to study psychology and, in particular, the nature of hypnotic suggestion and perception in altered states. While in the Signal Corps, Silva studied advanced electronics and became an instructor. When Silva was discharged, he resumed his radio repair business. The newly established Laredo Junior College asked him to create an electronics training program for the school. Five years later, with the spread of television, his repair business began to flourish and Silva ended his teaching career. Career in parapsychology During the 1940s, Silva developed a set of techniques with which he aimed to be able to alter his children's IQs and develop their psychic abilities (e.g. clairvoyance). His 'mind experiments' were based on his background in electronics and reading of psychology. He had read about alpha waves and the electrical activity in the human brain and bought an electroencephalograph (EEG). He found that one area of the brain, the part that produces alpha brain wave activity, was stronger than the others. This indicated to him that the electrical impedance of this area of the brain was lower, and therefore would function more efficiently. Since this part of the brain operated more efficiently, Silva believed that it could receive and store more information. The crucial problem for Silva was to keep the mind alert at these frequencies, which are associated more with daydreaming and sleep than with practical activity. Silva experimented with hypnosis, but while hypnosis made the mind more receptive, he felt that more individual control was necessary for improving brain function. He experimented next with mental training exercises to quiet the brain yet keep it more independently alert than in hypnosis. This, he reasoned, would lead to improved memory combined with understanding and hence to higher I.Q. scores. The exercises from which Silva's techniques evolved called for relaxed concentration and vivid mental visualization and ways of reaching lower levels. He believed that these levels proved more effective in learning than the fully awake, or beta wave, level. The proof for Silva was that in the three-year period that he worked with his children to develop his techniques, their grades in school sharply improved. =ESP experience= Silva's first reported experience with ESP (normally standing for extrasensory perception, but Silva preferred to call it effective sensory perception) occurred one evening in 1953, while his daughter was in her \\"alpha level.\\" Silva was questioning his daughter about her school work, and as she answered each question, he framed the next in his mind, before verbally asking the question. Silva reported that his daughter began to give the answers to the questions he was forming in his mind before he verbalized them. In this period, ESP was becoming a subject of scientific inquiry, largely through the published work of Dr. J. B. Rhine of Duke University. Silva wrote to Rhine to report that he had trained his daughter to practice ESP. In his response, Rhine pointed out that Silva's daughter may have been psychic before the training, and that he had not pretested her. Silva then worked to reproduce his results, and over the next ten years he trained thirty-nine Laredo residents, both children and adults, and continued to refine his process. He believed that he had developed a method to teach anyone to use ESP. =Silva's method= Silva's original ESP training method took 40 to 48 hours to complete. The method as currently promoted has been reduced to 18 to 20 hours through an apparent refinement of technique. Contemporary reports suggest as little as 12 to 14 hours is required by especially able practitioners. Silva wrote a book, You the Healer, on how to use the Silva Mind Control Method to heal yourself and others. He also started the Ecumenical Society of Psychorientology Inc. to protect users from allegations of practicing medicine without a license. A New York Times article on April 16, 1972 (\\"Can Man Control His Mind\\") reported that a Trinity University study showed that students trained in Mind Control did attain a high degree of Alpha level production. It also noted that C. W. Post College and Canisius College would offer courses in Silva's methods.  Death  Silva died peacefully in February 1999, aged 84. The Silva UltraMind ESP System was his final creation and was completed shortly before he died.

By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a National Olympic Committee have won (a nation is represented at a Games by the associated National Olympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If NOCs are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code. The number of bronze medals awarded was greater than either the gold or silver. This was due to a number of dead heats for third position, including the women's 100 meter hurdles and men's pole vault. Also, a second bronze medal was awarded for each of the boxing and judo events as there were no third/fourth position tiebreakers held. In the gymnastic events there were also several dead heats for gold medals, in the women's uneven bars and balance beam, as well as the men's rings. There was a four-way tie for second place in the men's vault resulting in four silver medals being handed out for a single event.

Built in 1869 as a private mansion, it opened as a hotel in 1887. History The founder of France's Le Figaro newspaper, Hippolyte de Villemessant, built the Villa Soleil in 1869 for writers seeking inspiration. In 1887, Italian hotelier Antoine Sella bought the property, and opened the Grand H√¥tel du Cap in 1889. In 1914, the Eden Roc pavillon was built 400 yards away from the main hotel. Gerald and Sara Murphy, a young American couple who had expatriated to France in the 1920s, once rented the hotel for an entire summer, a unique event for the era as the French Riviera was not a summer destination at the time, but a winter escape for the wealthy. With the Murphys came many writers and artists of the Lost Generation, including F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Fitzgerald immortalized it as the H√¥tel des Etrangers in Tender Is the Night.

Some scenes in the 1986 film, Under the Cherry Moon, starring and directed by Prince, were filmed at the hotel. For many years the hotel did not accept credit cards. Cash only was accepted, though most guests wired money ahead of their stay. In 2006 this policy was dropped.

Life Leo Frobenius in Africa (watercolour by Carl Arriens) He was born in Berlin as the son of a Prussian officer and died in Biganzolo, Lago Maggiore, Piedmont, Italy. He undertook his first expedition to Africa in 1904 to the Kasai district in Congo, formulating the African Atlantis theory during his travels. During World War I, between 1916 and 1917, Leo Frobenius spent almost an entire year in Romania, travelling with the German Army for scientific purposes. His team performed archaeological and ethnographic studies in the country, as well as documenting the day-to-day life of the ethnically diverse inmates of the Slobozia prisoner camp. Numerous photographic and drawing evidences of this period exist in the image archive of the Frobenius Institute.Mihai Dumitru, Leo Frobenius √Æn Rom√¢nia Until 1918 he travelled in the western and central Sudan, and in northern and northeastern Africa. In 1920 he founded the Institute for Cultural Morphology in Munich. Frobenius taught at the University of Frankfurt. In 1925, the city acquired his collection of about 4700 prehistorical African stone paintings, which are currently at the University's institute of ethnology, which was named the Frobenius Institute in his honour in 1946. In 1932 he became honorary professor at the University of Frankfurt, and in 1935 director of the municipal ethnographic museum. Theories Frobenius was influenced by Richard Andree, and his own teacher Friedrich Ratzel.Diffusionism and Acculturation anthropology.ua.edu In 1897/1898 Frobenius defined several \\"culture circles\\" (Kulturkreise), cultures showing similar traits that have been spread by diffusion or invasion. :de:Bernhard Ankermann was also influential in this area.Frobenius, Leo International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. 1968.

Research review-- > Institute of African studies. 3 (2) 1967, pages 2-20 lib.msu.edu With his term paideuma, Frobenius wanted to describe a gestalt, a manner of creating meaning (Sinnstiftung), that was typical of certain economic structures. Thus, the Frankfurt cultural morphologists tried to reconstruct \\"the\\" world-view of hunters, early planters, and megalith-builders or sacred kings. This concept of culture as a living organism was continued by his most devoted disciple, Adolf Ellegard Jensen, who applied it to his ethnological studies.Short Portrait: Adolf Ellegaard Jensen It also later influenced the theories of Oswald Spengler.Leon Surette, The Birth of Modernism, McGill- Queen's Press - MQUP, 1994, p. 63. His writings with Douglas Fox were a channel through which some African traditional storytelling and epic entered European literature. This applies in particular to Gassire's lute, an epic from West Africa which Frobenius had encountered in Mali. Ezra Pound corresponded with Frobenius from the 1920s, initially on economic topics. The story made its way into Pound's Cantos through this connection. In the 1930s, Frobenius claimed that he had found proof of the existence of the lost continent of Atlantis.\\"Leo Frobenius\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1960 edition African Atlantis Cover page from Expeditionsbericht der Zweiten Deutschen Inner-Afrika-Expedition (1907-09) Auf dem wege nach Atlantis'' \\"African Atlantis\\" is a hypothetical civilization thought to have once existed in northern Africa, initially proposed by Leo Frobenius around 1904.Miller, p. 4 Named after the mythical Atlantis, this lost civilization was conceived to be the root of African culture and social structure. Frobenius surmised that a white civilization must have existed in Africa prior to the arrival of the European colonisers, and that it was this white residue that enabled native Africans to exhibit traits of military power, political leadership and... monumental architecture Frobenius's theory stated that historical contact with immigrant whites of Mediterranean origin was responsible for advanced native African culture. He stated that such a civilization must have disappeared long ago, to allow for the perceived dilution of their civilization to the levels that were encountered during the period. Legacy Due to his studies in African history, Frobenius is a figure of renown in many African countries even today. In particular, he influenced L√©opold S√©dar Senghor, one of the founders of N√©gritude, who once claimed that Frobenius had \\"given Africa back its dignity and identity.\\" Aim√© C√©saire also quoted Frobenius as praising African people as being \\"civilized to the marrow of their bones\\", as opposed to the degrading vision encouraged by colonial propaganda. On the other hand, Wole Soyinka, in his 1986 Nobel Lecture, criticized Frobenius for his \\"schizophrenic\\" view of Yoruba art versus the people who made it. Quoting Frobenius's statement that \\"I was moved to silent melancholy at the thought that this assembly of degenerate and feeble-minded posterity should be the legitimate guardians of so much loveliness,\\" Soyinka calls such sentiments \\"a direct invitation to a free-for-all race for dispossession, justified on the grounds of the keeper's unworthiness.\\" Otto Rank relied on Frobenius' reports of the Fanany burial in South Africa to develop his idea of macrocosm and microcosm in his book Art and Artist (Kunst und K√ºnstler [1932]) \\"Certainly the idea of the womb as an animal has been widespread among different races of all ages, and it 'furnishes an explanation of (for instance) the second burial custom discovered by Frobenius along with the Fanany burial in South Africa. This consisted in placing the dead king's body in an artificially emptied bull's skin in such a manner that the appearance of life was achieved. This bull-rite was undoubtedly connected with the moon-cult (compare our \\"mooncalf,\\" even today) and belongs therefore to the above-mentioned maternal culture-stage, at which the rebirth idea also made use of maternal animal symbols, the larger mammals being chosen. Yet we must not overlook the fact that this \\"mother's womb symbolism\\" denotes more than the mere repetition of a person's own birth: it stands for the overcoming of human mortality by assimilation to the moon's immortality. This sewing-up of the dead in the animal skin has its mythical counterpart in the swallowing of the living by a dangerous animal, out of which he escapes by a miracle. Following an ancient microcosmic symbolism, Anaximander compared the mother's womb with the shark. This conception we meet later in its religious form as the Jonah myth, and it also appears in a cosmological adaptation in the whale myths collected in Oceania by Frobenius. Hence, also, the frequent suggestion that the seat of the soul after death (macrocosmic underworld) is in the belly of an animal (fish, dragon). The fact that in these traditions the animals are always those dangerous to man indicates that the animal womb is regarded not only as the scene of a potential rebirth but also as that of a dreaded mortality, and it is this which led to all the cosmic assimilations to the immortal stars.\\" Frobenius also confirmed the role of the moon cult in african cultures, according to Rank: \\"Bachofen [Johann Jakob Bachofen (1815-1887)] was the first to point out this connexion in the ancient primitive cultures in his Mutterrecht, but it has since received widespread corroboration from later researchers, in particular Frobenius, who discovered traces of a matriarchal culture in prehistoric Africa (Das unbekannte Afrika, Munich, 1923).\\" Frobenius' work gave Rank insight into the double meaning of the king's ritual murder, and the cultural development of soul belief: \\"Certain African traditions (Frobenius: Erythraa) lead to the assumption that the emphasizing of one or another of the inherent tendencies of the ritual was influenced by the character of the slain king, who in one case may have been feared and in another wanted back again.\\" \\"The Fanany myth, mentioned below, of the Betsileo in Madagascar shows already a certain progress from the primitive worm to the soul-animal.2 The Betsileo squeeze the putrefying liquid out of the bodies of the dead at the feet and catch it in a small jar. After two or three months a worm appears in it and is regarded as the spirit of the dead. This jar is then placed in the grave, where the corpse is laid only after the appearance of the Fanany. A bamboo rod connects the jar with the fresh air (corresponding to the \\" soulholes\\" of Northern stone graves). After six to eight months (corresponding possibly to the embryonic period) the Fanany (so the Betsileo believe) then appears in daylight in the form of a lizard. The relatives of the dead receive it with great celebrations and then push it back down the rod in the hope that this ancestral ghost will prosper exceedingly down below and become the powerful protector of the family and, for that matter, the whole village. 2 From Sibree's Madagascar, pp. 309 et seq., quoted by Frobenius in Der Seelenwurm (1895) and reprinted in Erlebte Erdteile, I (Frankfurt, 192.5), a treatise which deals principally with the \\"vase-cult\\" arising out of the storing of decayed remains in jars (see our later remarks on the vase in general). \\"Later totemism- the idea of descent from a definite animal species - seems to emerge only from a secondary interpretation of the soul-worm idea or the soul-animal idea in accordance with a 'law of inversion' (Frobenius) peculiar to mythical thought; just as the myth of the Creation as the projection backward in time of the myth of the end of the world is in itself only a formal expression of the principle of rebirth.\\" African art taken to Europe by Frobenius Afrikaabteilung_in_Ethnological_Museum_Berlin_105.JPGMask Tyi wara (Mali) Masque Kuba-Mus√©e ethnologique de Berlin.jpgKuba Mask (Congo) Afrikaabteilung in Ethnological Museum Berlin 65.JPGLuba (Congo) Afrikaabteilung in Ethnological Museum Berlin 32.JPGIfe (Nigeria) Works Rock carving known as \\"Meerkatze\\" (named by Frobenius) in Wadi Methkandoush * Die Geheimb√ºnde Afrikas (Hamburg 1894) * Der westafrikanische Kulturkreis.

Background De Kerckhove received his Ph.D in French Language and Literature from the University of Toronto in 1975 and a Doctorat du 3e cycle in Sociology of Art from the University of Tours (France) in 1979. He was an associate of the Centre for Culture and Technology from 1972 to 1980, and worked with Marshall McLuhan for over ten years as translator, assistant and co-author. Publications He edited Understanding 1984 (UNESCO, 1984) and co-edited with Amilcare Iannucci, McLuhan e la metamorfosi dell'uomo (Bulzoni, 1984) two collections of essays on McLuhan, culture, technology and biology. He also co-edited with Charles Lumsden The Alphabet and the Brain (Springer Verlag, 1988), a book which scientifically assesses the impact of the Western alphabet on the physiology and the psychology of human cognition. Another publication, La civilisation vid√©o-chr√©tienne appeared in France in December 1990 and in Italy the following year (Feltrinelli, 1991). Brainframes: Technology, Mind and Business (Bosch & Keuning, 1991) addresses the differences between the effects of television, computers and hypermedia on corporate culture, business practices and economic markets. The Skin of Culture (Somerville Press, 1995) is a collection of essays on the new electronic reality which stayed on Canadian best-sellers lists for several months. It was translated into a dozen languages including Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Polish and Slovenian. Connected Intelligence (Somerville, 1997) introduced his research on new media and cognition. His latest book, The Architecture of Intelligence, was first issued in Dutch in December 2000, and in English (June 2001), Italian and German in September 2001. It was later translated into Spanish, Portuguese and Japanese. He collaborated with Mark Federman on McLuhan for Managers: New Tools for New Thinking, published in September 2003. De Kerckhove is also contracted to work on a book about the history of stage performance from early Greek theatre to modern Opera, in collaboration with Francesco Monico. Other works The Point of Being co- edited with Cristina Miranda de Almeida. This book explores the research question: what are the psycho-physiological dimensions of the ways people experience their presence in the world and the world‚Äôs presence in them? There is in all chapters an invitation to experience a shift of perception. An embodied sensation of the world and a re-sensorialization of the environment are described to complement the visually-biased perspective with a renewed sense of humans‚Äô relationship to their spatial and material surrounding. As such, this book presents the topological reunion of sensation and cognition, of sense and sensibility and of body, self and world. The perception of the \\"Point of Being\\", to which the various chapters of this book invite the reader, proposes an alternative to the \\"Point of View\\" inherited from the Renaissance; it offers a way to situate the sense of self through the physical, digital and electronic domains that shape physical, social, cultural, economic and spiritual conditions at the beginning of the twenty- first century. Nine authors explore different ways in which the paradigm of the Point of Being can bridge the interval, the discontinuity, between subjects and objects that began with the diffusion of the phonetic alphabet. The Point of Being is a signpost on that journey.

The 1976 Summer Olympics medal table is a list of National Olympic Committees ranked by the number of medals won during the 1976 Summer Olympics, held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, from July 17 to August 1, 1976. A total of 6,084 athletes from 92 countries participated in these Games, competing in 198 events in 23 sports. Twenty-eight African countries boycotted these Games. This decision was taken in response to the participation of New Zealand, because its national rugby union team (the All Blacks) continued to play rugby with South Africa, which had been banned from the Olympic movement since 1964 due to its apartheid policies. Athletes from 42 countries won at least one medal, leaving 51 countries in blank in the medals table. The Soviet Union won the highest number of gold medals (49) and overall medals (125). Thailand and Bermuda won the first medals in their Olympic history, with Bermuda still being the least populous nation to ever win a Summer Olympic medal. The Montreal Summer Olympics proved disastrous to Canada not only in financial terms; it failed to win a single gold medal despite being the host nation. Overall, it was 27th in the medal table, which remains the worst result a host nation has ever scored in the history of the Games.

A total of 7,134 athletes from 121 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) competed in 195 events from 23 sports. Men's indoor handball, slalom canoeing and kayaking all made their Olympic debuts, while archery returned to the Olympic program after a 52-year hiatus. Rhodesia, like South Africa, was still segregated in 1972 and yet the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to invite Rhodesia to the 1972 Games. Eventually, African nations protested this invitation and threatened to boycott the Games. Three days before the opening ceremonies the IOC voted to rescind their invitation and exclude the Rhodesian athletes.Buchanon and Mallon (1999), p. 329 The Games were largely overshadowed by what has come to be known as the Munich massacre. On September 5 a group of eight Palestinian terrorists belonging to the Black September Organization broke into the Olympic Village and took nine Israeli athletes, coaches and officials hostage in their apartments. Two of the hostages who resisted were killed in the first moments of the break-in; the subsequent standoff in the Olympic Village lasted for almost 18 hours. Late in the evening of September 5, the terrorists and their hostages were transferred by helicopter to the military airport of F√ºrstenfeldbruck, ostensibly to board a plane bound for an undetermined Arab country. The German authorities planned to ambush them there, but underestimated the number of terrorists and were thus undermanned. During a botched rescue attempt, all of the Israeli hostages were killed. Four of them were shot, then incinerated when one of the terrorists detonated a grenade inside the helicopter in which the hostages were sitting. The five remaining hostages were then machine-gunned by another terrorist. Athletes from 48 NOCs won medals, leaving 73 NOCs unrepresented on the medal table. The Soviet Union edged the United States in total (99 to 94) and gold medals (50 to 33). Another notable rivalry took place between East and West Germany. Led by gymnast Karin Janz, who won two golds, two silvers and one bronze, East Germany (66 total and 20 gold medals) beat West Germany (13 gold and 40 total medals) to third place in the total medal count. East Germany would nearly overtake the United States in 1976, and then finish second in the medal count in 1980 and 1988.Wilkinson Johnson (2008), p. 205 American swimmer Mark Spitz won seven events, breaking the record for most gold medals by a single athlete in a single Olympic Games. Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut delivered another memorable performance. She entered the Olympics as an alternate on the Soviet gymnastics team, and replaced an injured teammate before the start of the competition. Korbut performed magnificently during the team competition and captured the global television audience with her personality. She helped the Soviet team win its sixth straight Olympic title and went on to win two more individual gold medals and one silver.Woolum (1998), pp. 166‚Äì167 Japanese gymnast Sawao Kato won three gold and two silver medals, including the men's individual all-around title. This was the second individual all-around title for Kato, after 1968. Kato would go on to take silver in the all-around competition in 1976 to cap an Olympic career medal total of eight golds, three silvers and one bronze. Finnish runner Lasse Vir√©n won both the 5,000 and 10,000 metre races. The 10,000 metres was won in dramatic fashion after he recovered from a fall to win and set a world record. He would repeat the double at the 1976 Games.

It is located between the third and fifth digits, between the little finger and the middle finger. It is so named for its traditional association with wedding rings in many cultures, though not all cultures use this finger as the ring finger. In some cultures the wedding ring is worn on the \\"ring finger\\" of the left hand and in others it is on the right hand. Traditionally, a wedding ring was worn only by the bride/wife, but in recent times more men also wear a wedding ring. It is also the custom in some cultures to wear an engagement ring on the ring finger. In anatomy, the ring finger is called digitus medicinalis, the fourth finger, digitus annularis, digitus quartus, or digitus IV. It may also be referred to as the third finger, excluding the thumb. In Latin, the word anulus means \\"ring\\", digitus means \\"finger\\", and quartus means \\"fourth\\". Etymology The origin of the selection of the fourth finger as the ring finger is not definitively known. According to L√°szl√≥ A. Magyar, the names of the ring finger in many languages reflect an ancient belief that it is a magical finger. It is named after magic or rings, or called nameless (for example, in ).Magyar, L√°szl√≥ A. \\"Digitus Medicinalis -- the Etymology of the Name\\" Actes du Congr. Intern. d'Hist. de Med. XXXII., Antwerpen. 175‚Äì179., 1990, retrieved September 2, 2009 In Japanese it is called (kusuri yubi, \\"medicine finger\\"), deriving its name from the fact, that it was frequently used when taking traditional powdered medicine, as it was rarely used otherwise and hence was considered the cleanest of all.Crunchy Nihongo! \\"Japanese Vocabularies: Talking about human body\\" In Sanskrit and other languages like Finnish or Russian, the ring finger is called respectively - \\"Anamika\\", \\"nimet√∂n\\" and \\"–ë–µ–∑—ã–º—è–Ω–Ω—ã–π\\" (\\"nameless\\"). In Arabic and Hebrew, the ring finger is called respectively ‚Äì bansur (meaning \\"victory\\") ‚Äì and kmitsa (meaning \\"taking a handful\\"). History Before medical science discovered how the circulatory system functioned, people believed that a vein ran directly from the fourth finger on the left hand to the heart. Because of the hand‚Äìheart connection, they chose the descriptive name vena amoris, Latin for the vein of love, for this particular vein. Based upon this name, their contemporaries, purported experts in the field of matrimonial etiquette, wrote that it would only be fitting that the wedding ring be worn on this finger. By wearing the ring on the fourth finger of the left hand, a married couple symbolically declares their eternal love for each other. In Britain, only women tended to wear a wedding ring until the 1st and 2nd World Wars, when married male soldiers started to wear rings to remind them of their partner. Contemporary customs =Western customs= In Western cultures, a wedding ring is traditionally worn on the fourth finger, commonly called the \\"ring finger\\". This developed from the Roman anulus pronubis when a man would give a ring to the woman at their betrothal ceremony. Blessing the wedding ring and putting it on the bride's finger dates from the 11th century. In medieval Europe, during the Christian wedding ceremony the ring was placed in sequence on the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers of the left hand. The ring was then left on the ring finger. In a few European countries, the ring is worn on the left hand prior to marriage, then transferred to the right during the ceremony. For example, a Greek Orthodox bride wears the ring on the left hand prior to the ceremony, then moves it to the right hand after the wedding. In England, the 1549 Prayer Book declared \\"the ring shall be placed on the left hand\\". By the 17th and 18th centuries, the ring could be found on any finger after the ceremony ‚Äî even on the thumb. The wedding ring is generally worn on the ring finger of the left hand in the former British Empire, certain parts of Western Europe, certain parts of Catholic Mexico, Bolivia, Chile and Central and Eastern Europe. These include: Australia, Botswana, Canada, Egypt, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, the UK, and the US; France, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland, Croatia, Slovenia, and Romania. Also in Catalonia and Valencia (in Spain it's generally worn on the right). The wedding ring is worn on the ring finger of the right hand in some Orthodox and a small number of Catholic European countries, some Protestant Western European, as well as some Central and South American Catholic countries.Why in the Orthodox tradition do we wear the wedding ring on the left hand?, antiochian.org In Eastern Europe, these include: Bulgaria, Greece, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine. In Central or Western Europe, these include: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Netherlands [if not Catholic], Norway and Spain (except in Catalonia and Valencia). In Central or South America, these include: Colombia, Cuba, Peru, Venezuela. The ring is worn on the right hand until the actual wedding day, when it is moved to the left hand in Turkey, Lebanon, and Syria as well as in Romania and Brazil. In western music, for instance the guitar, \\"I-M-A\\" is a style of plucking guitar strings, where \\"I\\" means index finger, \\"M\\" means middle finger, and \\"A\\" means ring finger. This is a popular type of \\"finger style\\" guitar playing, where the \\"A\\" comes from Latin, where the word anulus means ring. Source: https://douglasniedt.com/Tech_Tip_Right_Hand_Planting_Technique_Arpeggios.html =Middle Eastern, Jewish and South Asian customs= In Sinhalese and Tamil culture, the groom wears the wedding ring on his right hand and bride wears it on her left hand ring finger. This can be seen in countries like Sri Lanka where there is a rich Sinhalese and Tamil cultural influence in the society. A wedding ring is not a traditional part of the religious Muslim wedding and wedding rings are not included in most Islamic countries. However, if a wedding ring is worn in an Islamic country, it may be worn on either the left (such is the custom in Iran) and for example (in Jordan the right ring finger for engagement and the left ring finger for marriage). As opposed to the wedding ring, use of a ring to denote betrothal or engagement is quite prevalent in Muslim countries, especially those in West and South Asia. Muslim engagement rings are typically worn on the right finger by men, and the left finger by women. In a traditional Jewish wedding ceremony, the wedding ring is placed on the bride's righthand index finger, but other traditions place it on the middle finger or the thumb, most commonly in recent times.David Sperber, in: Daniel Sperber, Minhagei Yisrael Vol. 4, Jerusalem 1995, pp. 92-93 (Hebrew) Today, the ring usually is moved to the left hand ring finger after the ceremony. Some Jewish grooms have adopted wearing a wedding ring. However, in Orthodox Judaism, most men do not wear wedding rings. Rings are not traditional in an Indian wedding. However, in modern society, it is becoming a practice to wear rings for engagements and not for actual marriage. Though the left hand is considered inauspicious for religious activities, a ring (not to be called wedding ring) is still worn on the left hand. Men generally wear the rings on the right hand and the women on the left hands.

Some related theories also argue (and can show statistically) that mass behaviour (by becoming more predictable and \\"known\\" to other people) can reduce accident risks, such as in traffic safety ‚Äì in this case, the safety effect creates an actual reduction of danger, rather than just a redistribution over a larger group. In biology The mathematical biologist W.D. Hamilton proposed his selfish herd theory in 1971 to explain why animals seek central positions in a group. Each individual can reduce its own domain of danger by situating itself with neighbours all around, so it moves towards the centre of the group. The effect was tested in brown fur seal predation by great white sharks. Using decoy seals, the distance between decoys was varied to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had as predicted an increased risk of shark attack. Antipredator adaptations include behaviour such as the flocking of birds, herding of sheep and schooling of fish. Similarly, Adelie penguins wait to jump into the water until a large enough group has assembled, reducing each individual's risk of seal predation. This behavior is also seen in masting and predator satiation where the predators are overwhelmed with an abundance of prey during a period of time resulting in more of the prey surviving. In road traffic safety Amsterdam, 1982 In 1949 R. J. Smeed reported that per capita road fatality rates tended to be lower in countries with higher rates of motor vehicle ownership. This observation led to Smeed's Law. In 2003 P. L. Jacobsen compared rates of walking and cycling, in a range of countries, with rates of collisions between motorists and cyclists or walkers. He found an inverse relationship that was hypothesised to be explained by a concept described as 'behavioural adaptation', whereby drivers who are exposed to greater numbers of cyclists on the road begin to drive more safely around them. Though an attractive concept for cycling advocates, it has not been empirically validated. Other combined modelling and empirical evidence suggests that while changes in driver behaviour might still be one way that collision risk per cyclist declines with greater numbers, the effect can be easily produced through simple spatial processes akin to the biological herding processes described above. Without considering hypotheses 1 or 3, Jacobsen concluded that \\"A motorist is less likely to collide with a person walking and bicycling if more people walk or bicycle.\\" He described this theory as \\"safety in numbers.\\" Safety in numbers is also used to describe the evidence that the number of pedestrians or cyclists correlates inversely with the risk of a motorist colliding with a pedestrian or cyclist. This non-linear relationship was first shown at intersections. It has been confirmed by ecologic data from cities in California and Denmark, and European countries, and time-series data for the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The number of pedestrians or bicyclists injured increases at a slower rate than would be expected based on their numbers. That is, more people walk or cycle where the risk to the individual pedestrian or bicyclist is lower. A 2002 study into whether pedestrian risk decreased with pedestrian flow, using 1983-86 data from signalized intersections in a town in Canada, found that in some circumstances pedestrian flow increased where the risk per pedestrian decreased. After cycling was promoted in Finland, there was a 75% drop in cyclists deaths and the number of trips increased by 72%. In England, between 2000 and 2008, serious bicycle injuries declined by 12%. Over the same period, the number of bicycle trips made in London doubled. Motor vehicle traffic decreased by 16%, bicycle use increased by 28% and cyclist injuries had decreased by 20% in the first year of operation of the London Congestion Charge. In January 2008, the number of cyclists in London being treated in hospitals for serious injuries had increased by 100% in six years. Over the same time, they report, the number of cyclists had increased by 84%. In York, comparing the periods 1991-93 and 1996‚Äì98, the number of bicyclists killed and seriously injured fell by 59%. The share of trips made by bicycle rose from 15% to 18%. In Germany, between 1975 and 2001, the total number of bicycle trips made in Berlin almost quadrupled. Between 1990 and 2007, the share of trips made by bicycle increased from 5% to 10%. Between 1992 and 2006, the number of serious bicycle injuries declined by 38%. In Germany as a whole, between 1975 and 1998, cyclist fatalities fell by 66% and the percent of trips made by bicycle rose from 8% to 12%.

In Portland, Oregon, between 1990 and 2000, the percentage of workers who commuted to work by bicycle rose from 1.1% to 1.8%. By 2008, the proportion has risen to 6.0%; while the number of workers increased by only 36% between 1990 and 2008, the number of workers commuting by bicycle increased 608%. Between 1992 and 2008, the number of bicyclists crossing four bridges into downtown was measured to have increased 369% between 1992 and 2008. During that same period, the number of reported crashes increased by only 14%. In Copenhagen, Denmark, between 1995 and 2006, the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured fell by 60%.

It has been used by the air forces of Poland and India. It is notable as being the first domestically- developed jet aircraft to be produced by Poland, its service for over 50 years as the principal training aircraft of the Polish Air Force, and as the oldest jet-propelled aircraft still in service in Poland. As a part of efforts to preserve Poland's ability to independently develop aircraft in an era of political and economic subservience to the neighbouring Soviet Union, during the 1950s, Polish engineers at the Poland's Aviation Institute (IL) commenced early work upon the design of what would become the first jet aircraft to be developed in Poland. Following the death of Joseph Stalin, work on the initiative could be performed more openly and government officials became supportive of such a venture. The fledgling design was heavily influence by the requirements specified by the Polish Air Force, who had formalised a requirement for a jet-propelled aircraft for training purposes. On 5 February 1960, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight, powered by an imported British Armstrong Siddeley Viper turbojet engine. During 1963, deliveries of the first production model of the type, designated as the TS-11 Iskra bis A, commenced to the Polish Air Force. During the 1960s, the Iskra competed to be selected as the standard jet trainer throughout the Warsaw Pact. However, it was not selected to fulfil this significant role, the rival Czechoslovakian Aero L-29 Delf√≠n having been chosen instead, which went on to be built in greater numbers for a wide number of export customers. Production of the TS-11 came to an end during 1987, however the type remained in service with the Polish Air Force and the Indian Air Force into the 21st century. From 1969 onwards, a handful of TS-11s have been used by the Polish Air Force's Bia≈Ço- Czerwone Iskry aerobatics display team. It has also been used for aerial reconnaissance purposes. During the aircraft's later years of service, several examples have been sold onto private owners. Development TS-11 Iskra bis B ‚Äì front view Following the end of the Second World War, Poland was politically dominated by the neighbouring Soviet Union; as a consequence, the Polish aviation industry underwent vast changes at the behest of the Soviets. According to aviation author Jerzy K. Cynk, the immediate post-war decade was a period of frustrated efforts and disappointments, by early 1951, all of the nation's design offices had been dissolved and the entirety of indigenous projects were terminated. Instead, Poland's aircraft factories were assigned to produce mainly Russian-sourced military-orientated equipment to meet the requirements of the Soviet war machine, such as the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 fighter aircraft. Shortly following the death of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, military orders were drastically cut, leading to Polish aircraft plants falling idle and some being permanently closing down.Cynk 1962. p. 14. While the nation's design offices had been liquidated, some former members had joined Poland's Aviation Institute (1L) and performed some limited work on various original projects, even though such efforts were initially officially discouraged. As such, it was at IL that the effort to design would become the first jet aircraft to be developed in Poland originated; however, during the late 1950s, responsibility for the design work on the program was transferred to aircraft manufacturer PZL-Mielec at an early stage in order that IL could resume its primary mission of scientific and technological research. Much of the design work on the program was produced in response to the specified needs of a requirement issued by the Polish Air Force for a capable jet-propelled trainer aircraft, which was seeking a replacement for the piston-engined PZL TS-8 Bies at the time. Polish government officials came to openly regard the project as being of considerable importance to the nation's aviation industry, thus vigorous efforts were made to support the development of the TS-11. The main designer was Polish aeronautical engineer Tadeusz So≈Çtyk; his initials was the source for part of the type's official designation TS-11.Cynk 1962. p. 15. Early on, it was decided to adopt a foreign-sourced turbojet engine to power the aircraft. Quickly, the British Armstrong Siddeley Viper had emerged as the company's favoured option; however, reportedly, negotiations for its acquisition eventually broken down; accordingly, work on the project was delayed until a suitable domestically-built powerplant had reached an advanced stage of development. On 5 February 1960, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight, powered by an imported Viper 8 engine, capable of producing up to 7.80 kN (1,750 lbf) of thrust. On 11 September 1960, the aircraft's existence was publicly revealed during an aerial display held over Lodz. The next pair of prototypes, which performed their first flights during March and July 1961 respectively, were instead powered by a Polish copy of the Viper engine, designated as the WSK HO-10.Cynk, Jerzy K. \\"At the crossroads.\\" Flight International, 3 June 1971. p. 808. The flight test program that the three prototypes were subjected to had both demonstrated the capabilities of the new aircraft and its suitability for satisfying the Polish Air Force's stated requirements for a trainer jet; as such, it was soon accepted by the Polish Air Force. During 1963, the first production model of the type, designated as the TS-11 Iskra bis A, commenced delivery to the service. From about 1966, new-build aircraft were furnished with a newer Polish-designed turbojet engine, designated as the WSK SO-1, which was capable of producing up to 9.80 kN (2,200 lbf) of thrust and reportedly gave the TS-11 a top speed of 497 mph. From 1969 onwards, the improved WSK SO-3 engine became available, offering considerably longer times between overhauls; this engine was later improved into the WSK SO-3W, which was able to generate 10.80 kN (2,425 lbf) of thrust.\\"PZL (Poland).\\" Flight International, 13 January 1979. p. 104. Design TS-11 Iskra bis B The PZL TS-11 Iskra is an all-metal jet-propelled trainer aircraft. It is relatively conventional in layout, featuring a trapezoid-shaped mid-wing arrangement. These wings, which only had a gentle angle of sweep along the leading edge, feature air intakes embedded into the wing root. The TS-11's single turbojet engine is accommodated with the main fuselage, its exhaust is located beneath the boom-mounted tail fin, which provides the aircraft with a fairly unusual silhouette. Both of the crew, typically being the student in the front and instructor in the back, are provided with ejector seats for emergency egress. Some models of the TS-11 can be armed; armaments have consisted of a single nose-mounted Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 cannon with 80 rounds, along with a total of four underwing hardpoints that were compatible with a variety of different weapons, including bombs and rockets.\\"WSK - Mielec TS-11 Iskra.\\" Flight International, 13 December 1973. p. 1012. Most models of the aircraft lack a radar set; however, the specialised TS-11R reconnaissance variant is provided with such equipment. The TS-11 can also be outfitted with various cameras for the purpose of performing aerial photography missions. Poland is currently developing the new TS-11S Iskra (Spark) as a future jet trainer. It will be equipped with new avionics, strengthened structures and a more powerful engine. Operational history HUD mounted in PZL TS-11F Iskra (MSPO 2008). TS-11 Iskra MR of Bia≈Ço- Czerwone Iskry aerobatic team During 1964, the TS-11 prototype broke four separate world records in its class, including a speed record, having been recorded as having attained a top speed of 839 km/h (524 mph) during one flight. From 1969 onwards, various TS-11s have been used by the Polish Air Force's aerobatics display team, which was initially called Rombik and is currently named Bia≈Ço-Czerwone Iskry (Translates to English as White-and-Red Sparks).Lipka, Lukasz and Pawel Walaszek. \\"41st Training Air Base.\\" Aviation Photo Digest, Registered: 17 February 2018.\\"White-red Sparks from Poland at SIAF 2014.\\" siaf.sk, 9 July 2014. Unusually for an Eastern European aircraft of the era, the TS-11 never received a NATO reporting name (for jet trainers, a two-syllable word starting with letter M) for the type. During the 1960s, the Iskra competed to be selected as the standard jet trainer for the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet Union had given Poland a promise to support its aviation industry and to favour the procurement of suitable aircraft for this purpose from Polish manufacturers.Cynk 1962. pp. 14-15. However, the Iskra was not selected for this role, it had lost out to the Czechoslovak Aero L-29 Delf√≠n, another newly-designed jet-propelled trainer aircraft; according to aviation author John C. Fredrikson, this outcome had been highly unexpected and surprising to several observers.Fredriksen 2001, p. 4. Largely as a result of this decision, Poland became the only Warsaw Pact member to adopt the Iskra while most others adopting the rival Delfin instead. During 1975, an initial batch of 50 Iskra bis D trainer aircraft were exported to India, the type's sole export customer; during the 1990s, a further 26 aircraft were delivered to the Indian Air Force. During its Indian service, a total of seven aircraft were reportedly lost, killing four crew. During December 2004, the Indian Air Force officially withdrew the last of its Iskra trainers.

Also known as the cosmic scale factor or sometimes the Robertson Walker scale factor, this is a key parameter of the Friedmann equations. In the early stages of the Big Bang, most of the energy was in the form of radiation, and that radiation was the dominant influence on the expansion of the universe. Later, with cooling from the expansion the roles of matter and radiation changed and the universe entered a matter-dominated era. Recent results suggest that we have already entered an era dominated by dark energy, but examination of the roles of matter and radiation are most important for understanding the early universe. Using the dimensionless scale factor to characterize the expansion of the universe, the effective energy densities of radiation and matter scale differently. This leads to a radiation-dominated era in the very early universe but a transition to a matter-dominated era at a later time and, since about 4 billion years ago, a subsequent dark-energy-dominated era. Detail Some insight into the expansion can be obtained from a Newtonian expansion model which leads to a simplified version of the Friedman equation. It relates the proper distance (which can change over time, unlike the comoving distance which is constant) between a pair of objects, e.g. two galaxy clusters, moving with the Hubble flow in an expanding or contracting FLRW universe at any arbitrary time t to their distance at some reference time t_0. The formula for this is: :d(t) = a(t)d_0,\\\\, where d(t) is the proper distance at epoch t, d_0 is the distance at the reference time t_0 and a(t) is the scale factor. Thus, by definition, d_0=d(t_0) and a(t_0) = 1. The scale factor is dimensionless, with t counted from the birth of the universe and t_0 set to the present age of the universe: 13.799\\\\pm0.021\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Gyr} giving the current value of a as a(t_0) or 1. The evolution of the scale factor is a dynamical question, determined by the equations of general relativity, which are presented in the case of a locally isotropic, locally homogeneous universe by the Friedmann equations. The Hubble parameter is defined: :H(t) \\\\equiv {\\\\dot{a}(t) \\\\over a(t)} where the dot represents a time derivative. The Hubble parameter varies with time, not with space, being the Hubble constant H_0 the current value. From the previous equation d(t) = d_0 a(t) one can see that \\\\dot{d}(t) = d_0 \\\\dot{a}(t), and also that d_0 = \\\\frac{d(t)}{a(t)}, so combining these gives \\\\dot{d}(t) = \\\\frac{d(t) \\\\dot{a}(t)}{a(t)}, and substituting the above definition of the Hubble parameter gives \\\\dot{d}(t) = H(t) d(t) which is just Hubble's law. Current evidence suggests that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating, which means that the second derivative of the scale factor \\\\ddot{a}(t) is positive, or equivalently that the first derivative \\\\dot{a}(t) is increasing over time. This also implies that any given galaxy recedes from us with increasing speed over time, i.e. for that galaxy \\\\dot{d}(t) is increasing with time. In contrast, the Hubble parameter seems to be decreasing with time, meaning that if we were to look at some fixed distance d and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance, later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones.Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light? (see final paragraph) According to the Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker metric which is used to model the expanding universe, if at present time we receive light from a distant object with a redshift of z, then the scale factor at the time the object originally emitted that light is a(t) = \\\\frac{1}{1 + z}.Davies, Paul (1992), The New Physics, p. 187.Mukhanov, V. F. (2005), Physical Foundations of Cosmology, p. 58. Chronology =Radiation-dominated era= After Inflation, and until about 47,000 years after the Big Bang, the dynamics of the early universe were set by radiation (referring generally to the constituents of the universe which moved relativistically, principally photons and neutrinos).Ryden, Barbara, \\"Introduction to Cosmology\\", 2006, eqn. 5.25, 6.41 For a radiation- dominated universe the evolution of the scale factor in the Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker metric is obtained solving the Friedmann equations: :a(t)\\\\propto t^{1/2}. \\\\, Padmanabhan (1993), p. 64. =Matter- dominated era= Between about 47,000 years and 9.8 billion years after the Big Bang,Ryden, Barbara, \\"Introduction to Cosmology\\", 2006, eqn. 6.33, 6.41 the energy density of matter exceeded both the energy density of radiation and the vacuum energy density.Zelik, M and Gregory, S: \\"Introductory Astronomy & Astrophysics\\", page 497. Thompson Learning, Inc. 1998 When the early universe was about 47,000 years old (redshift 3600), mass‚Äìenergy density surpassed the radiation energy, although the universe remained optically thick to radiation until the universe was about 378,000 years old (redshift 1100). This second moment in time (close to the time of recombination) at which point the photons which compose the cosmic microwave background radiation were last scattered, is often mistaken as marking the end of the radiation era. For a matter- dominated universe the evolution of the scale factor in the Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker metric is easily obtained solving the Friedmann equations: :a(t)\\\\propto t^{2/3} =Dark-energy-dominated era= In physical cosmology, the dark-energy-dominated era is proposed as the last of the three phases of the known universe, the other two being the matter- dominated era and the radiation-dominated era. The dark-energy-dominated era began after the matter-dominated era, i.e. when the Universe was about 9.8 billion years old.Ryden, Barbara, \\"Introduction to Cosmology\\", 2006, eqn. 6.33 In the era of the cosmic inflation the Hubble parameter is also thought of to be constant, so the expansion law of the dark-energy-dominated era also holds for the inflationary prequel of the big bang. The cosmological constant is given the symbol Œõ, and, considered as a source term in the Einstein field equation, can be viewed as equivalent to a \\"mass\\" of empty space, or dark energy. Since this increases with the volume of the universe, the expansion pressure is effectively constant, independent of the scale of the universe, while the other terms decrease with time. Thus, as the density of other forms of matter ‚Äì dust and radiation ‚Äì drops to very low concentrations, the cosmological constant (or \\"dark energy\\") term will eventually dominate the energy density of the Universe. Recent measurements of the change in Hubble constant with time, based on observations of distant supernovae, show this acceleration in expansion rate,The Nobel Prize in Physics 2011. Retrieved 18 May 2017. indicating the presence of such dark energy. For a dark-energy- dominated universe, the evolution of the scale factor in the Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker metric is easily obtained solving the Friedmann equations: :a(t)\\\\propto \\\\exp(H_0t) Here, the coefficient H_0in the exponential, the Hubble constant, is :H_0 = \\\\sqrt{8\\\\pi G \\\\rho_\\\\mathrm{full} / 3} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\Lambda / 3}. This exponential dependence on time makes the spacetime geometry identical to the de Sitter universe, and only holds for a positive sign of the cosmological constant, which is the case according to the current accepted value of the cosmological constant, Œõ, that is approximately The current density of the observable universe is of the order of and the age of the universe is of the order of 13.8 billion years, or . The Hubble constant, H_0, is (The Hubble time is 13.79 billion years).

He is the 2017 100m World Champion. He is the 2004 Olympic champion in the 100 metres, the 2005 and 2017 World champion in the same event, and the 2005 World champion in the 200 metres. He is considered one of the best sprinters of the Modern Era. He is also notorious for his blazing starts.Gatlin was banned from competing between 2006 and 2010 by the USADA for failing a second drugs test, testing positive for testosterone. Overview A five-time Olympic medalist, Justin Gatlin's personal best of 9.74 seconds ranks fifth on the all-time list of male 100-metre athletes. He is a two-time 100m World Champion and a two-time indoor world champion in the 60-metre dash in 2003 and 2012, and won both the 100 metres and, 200 metres at the 2005 World Championships. In 2001, Gatlin incurred a two-year ban from athletics for testing positive for a banned substance; this ban was then later reduced to one year because of an appeal. In 2006, he incurred a further four-year ban (originally an eight-year ban) from track and field for testing positive for a banned substance, with this sanction erasing his then-world-record time of 9.77 seconds in the 100 metres. Gatlin began competing again in August 2010, soon after his eligibility was reinstated. In June 2012 at the US Olympic trials, Gatlin ran a time of 9.80 seconds, which was the fastest-ever time recorded for a man over the age of 30. His continued elite-level career after serving bans for two doping offences made him a controversial figure in the sport.. Gatlin won the gold medal in the 100 metres at the 2004 Olympics. After not competing in the 2008 Olympics due to suspension, he ran a time of 9.79 seconds in the 100 metres final at the London 2012 Olympics, earning a bronze medal. His performance at the 2012 Olympic 100-metre final contributed to the fastest 100-metre race in history, which saw the three medal winners, Usain Bolt, Yohan Blake and Gatlin all run under 9.80 seconds. He won his third Olympic medal in the 100 metres in the 2016 Olympic 100-metre final, finishing with the silver. At 34, he became the oldest man to win an Olympic medal in a non-relay sprint event. At the age of 35, Gatlin won the gold medal in the 100 metres at the 2017 World Championships, a full 12 years after his first triumph in the event; in doing so, he defeated three-time world and Olympic champion, also world record holder, Usain Bolt in the latter's final individual race at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics in London. At the 2019 World Championships in Athletics held in Doha, Qatar, Gatlin won the silver medal in the 100m in a time of 9.89, behind his compatriot Christian Coleman who won gold in 9.76 seconds. Gatlin's silver medal at the 2019 World Championships has made him the most decorated 100m sprinter in World Championship history, with a record of five individual 100m medals at the World Championships, surpassing Usain Bolt's haul of four. Career from 2000 to 2006 Gatlin attended Woodham High School in Pensacola, Florida. Gatlin was awarded a scholarship to the University of Tennessee. In the fall of 2000, Gatlin arrived at University of Tennessee, Knoxville, as a good high school 110-metre hurdler. During high school, Gatlin was recruited for track by coaches Vince Anderson and Bill Webb who quickly realized his potential and turned him into a sprinter. After training and competing in Tennessee's program for two years under the guidance of former assistant Vince Anderson, Gatlin won six consecutive NCAA titles. In the fall of 2004, Gatlin graduated from Tennessee after his four seasons to join the professional ranks. Just two years later, he won the gold medal in the 100 metres (9.85 seconds) at the 2004 Summer Olympics, narrowly beating Francis Obikwelu of Portugal and the defending champion Maurice Greene. He also won a bronze medal in an American sweep of the 200-metre race, and a silver medal as a member of the 4 √ó 100 metres relay squad. In the 2005 World Athletics Championships in Helsinki, he won gold in 100 metres from defending champion Kim Collins. On August 7, 2005, Gatlin clocked a 100 metres time of 9.88 seconds to win the World Championship in Helsinki. Starting as a favorite and with world record holder Asafa Powell not competing due to injury, Gatlin beat his competitors by the widest margin ever seen at a men's world championship 100 metres to capture the Olympic-World Championship double. Gatlin also won the 200 metres in Helsinki, becoming the second person in athletics history to win both sprint distances during a single World Championship (the first was Maurice Greene during the 1999 championships in Seville, the third ‚Äì Tyson Gay during the 2007 championships in Osaka and the 4th ‚Äì Usain Bolt during the 2009 championships in Berlin). In the 200-metre event, American athletes earned the top four places, the first time any country had done so in World Championship athletics history. On May 12, 2006, Gatlin, running in the final of the IAAF Super Tour meeting in Doha, Qatar, equalled the 100-metre world record of 9.77 seconds (set in 2005 by Jamaica's Asafa Powell), though this was later annulled. It had originally been reported that he had beaten the record, with a time of 9.76 seconds +1.7 m/s wind. However, the IAAF revealed on May 16 that his time had been 9.766 seconds, which was subsequently rounded up to 9.77, in line with regulations. Shortly thereafter, with the track and field community itching for a Gatlin-Powell showdown, the two both appeared at the Prefontaine Classic in Oregon. No agreement could be reached with the meet organizers, however, so the two competed in separate heats. Gatlin won the event with a time of 9.88 seconds over Powell's 9.93 seconds. Gatlin pulled out of a meeting with Powell set for July 28, 2006 at the London Grand Prix. Gatlin lives and trains in Kissimmee, Florida with coach Brooks Johnson. He is a regular competitor on Spike TV's show Pros vs Joes, which pits professional athletes against nonprofessionals. On December 19, 2006 ESPN reported that Gatlin would work with Woodham High School's track team as a voluntary coach. He will help his old high school with \\"some workouts, sprint work, block work, where he sees something and can give encouragement.\\" Doping bans In 2001, Gatlin was banned from international competition for two years after testing positive for amphetamines. Gatlin appealed on the grounds that the positive test had been due to medication that he had been taking since his childhood, when he was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. The appeal resulted in an early reinstatement by the IAAF. On July 29, 2006, Gatlin told the media that he had been informed by the USADA that he had given a positive doping test in April the same year. He claimed his innocence in the matter: It is believed that the substance that Gatlin tested positive for was \\"testosterone or its precursor.\\" The failed test was revealed after a relay race on April 22, 2006 in Lawrence, Kansas. The \\"B\\" sample was confirmed as positive in July. Gatlin was coached by Trevor Graham. Among athletes Graham has coached, eight have tested positive or received bans for performance-enhancing drugs. After Gatlin's failed test, Graham stated in an interview that Gatlin had been sabotaged. He blamed massage therapist Christopher Whetstine for rubbing a cream containing testosterone onto Gatlin's buttocks without his knowledge. The therapist denied the claim, saying: \\"Trevor Graham is not speaking on behalf of Justin Gatlin and the story about me is not true.\\" On August 22, 2006, Gatlin accepted an eight-year ban from track and field, avoiding a lifetime ban in exchange for his cooperation with the doping authorities, and because of the \\"exceptional circumstances\\" surrounding his first positive drug test. Gatlin appealed against the ban; an arbitration panel reduced it to four years at a hearing in December 2007. The USADA's chief executive officer explained \\"Given his cooperation and the circumstances relating to Mr Gatlin's first offence, the four-year penalty issued by the arbitration panel is a fair and just outcome\\". His 9.77s performance, set in May 2006, was annulled. Gatlin in 2009. Possible NFL career It was reported that Gatlin planned to serve his four-year ban from the track on a football field. On November 29, 2006 ESPN reported that Gatlin had worked out with the Houston Texans, although he has little football experience and \\"has not played football since 10th grade\\". On May 4, 2007 The Tampa Bay Buccaneers announced that Gatlin was one of 28 free agents taken to their 2007 rookie camp on tryout contracts, and was considered to be the most intriguing unsigned athlete in attendance. He tried out for the team as a wide receiver. He was unsuccessful, though he stated that he believed that he had all the necessary skills and that the only reason he did not make the team was because coaches viewed him as a \\"track guy.\\" Return Gatlin celebrating his win at the 2012 World Indoor Championships. On August 3, 2010 Gatlin made his return to the athletics circuit after a four-year doping ban with a tour of Estonia and Finland. He won the 100 metres in Rakvere, recording 10.24 seconds. At the Ergo World Challenge meeting in Tallinn he improved further with a win in 10.17 seconds. His coach, Loren Seagrave, acknowledged that the sprinter's starts were poor, but that Gatlin's finish to the race remained strong. Running at the final meet of the Finnish Elite Games series in Joensuu, Gatlin won in the absence of injured Steve Mullings.Sonninen, A-P (August 22, 2010).

In Rovereto, Italy, on August 31, 2010 Gatlin was placed second in the 100 metres with a time of 10.09 seconds, behind Yohan Blake, who won in 10.06 seconds. On June 25, 2011, in the 2011 USA Track & Field Championships, Gatlin was second behind Walter Dix with a season's best time of 9.95 seconds. He represented the United States at the IAAF World Championships in Daegu, South Korea, where he was eliminated in the semi-finals. At the 2012 Diamond League meeting in Doha, Gatlin ran 9.87 seconds, defeating Asafa Powell by one hundredth of a second, and putting himself as a favorite for a medal at the 2012 London Olympics. On June 24, 2012 Gatlin won the 100-metre final at the US Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon with a personal best time of 9.80 seconds, the fastest time in history for a man over 30. On August 5, 2012 at the London 2012 Summer Olympics, he recorded a new personal best time of 9.79 seconds in the 100 metres final, when he won bronze behind Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake. On June 6, 2013, Gatlin beat world record holder Usain Bolt by one-hundredth of a second to win the 100 metres at the Golden Gala meet in Rome, Italy. On August 11, 2013, Gatlin won a silver medal behind Usain Bolt in the 100 metres at the IAAF World Championships in a time of 9.85. Bolt won the race in 9.77. Gatlin also took another silver in the 4 √ó 100-metre relay, crossing the line in 37.66 seconds, behind the Jamaican team that won in 37.36 seconds. On September 5, 2014, Gatlin won the 100 metres at the IAAF Diamond League final in Brussels with a personal best of 9.77 seconds. He then went on to complete a sprint double at the meet, winning the 200 metres in a time of 19.71 seconds. This was the second fastest time of the season, behind his world lead of 19.68 that he set at the Monaco Diamond League earlier in the year. Gatlin's performances earned him a nomination for IAAF Athlete of the Year. Other athletes responded skeptically to Gatlin, questioning whether he is continuing to benefit from the banned substances taken earlier in his career. German discus champion Robert Harting requested to the IAAF that his nomination for Athlete of the Year be rescinded in protest at Gatlin being nominated.

Gatlin also ran in the qualifying heats of the 200 metres. However, with a time of 20.13 seconds in the semi-finals, he failed to qualify for the final. To qualify for the final, he would have needed to have run 20.09. At the 2017 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, Justin Gatlin won the 100 metres in 9.95 seconds, beating young favorite Christian Coleman, who clocked 9.98 seconds. In doing so, he broke Kim Collins' World M35 Masters Record of 9.96 seconds, and was 0.02 of a second away from breaking the World Masters All-Time record of 9.93 also from Collins. He opted out of the 200 metres after his Olympic disaster, which was caused by a rolled ankle coming off the turn. Gatlin surprised many at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics by winning gold with a time of 9.92 seconds. He shocked the world by beating the greatest sprinter of all time. Despite the crowding being against him throughout the World championship, he proved his critics wrong and won the gold after 12 years of winning minor medals. He beat his American teammate Christian Coleman, who won the silver, and Usain Bolt (in his final World Championships) who earned the bronze. Several spectators booed at the result and IAAF President Lord Coe commented that he should have been banned for life. Usain Bolt, however, condemned the booing as unfair and emphasised that Gatlin worked very hard and thus deserved the victory. En Route to the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar; Gatlin ran 9.87 seconds in the 100 meters at the Prefontaine Classic in Stanford, California, finishing second to teammate Christian Coleman, who ran a world- leading 9.81s. Gatlin‚Äôs 9.87 improved upon his 35+ world masters record from 9.92, as well as making him the fourth fastest man in the world for that year. Gatlin won the silver medal in the 100m final at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in an attempt to defend his world title. His time of 9.89s was .13 seconds behind his teammate Christian Coleman, who won gold in 9.76 seconds. At 37 years, 230 days, Gatlin became the oldest sprinter to win a medal in the men‚Äôs 100 meters at the World Athletics Championships. Wind- aided run In 2011, on the Japanese TV show Kasupe!, Gatlin ran 100 metres in 9.45 seconds (+20 m/s) assisted by large wind machines blowing at speeds over 25 metres per second, faster than Usain Bolt's 9.58 seconds record. He received 2 million yen (approximately US$25,000) for appearing on the program.Justin Gatlin runs 9.45!! Breaks Usain Bolt 100m World Record!!!! YouTubeKasupe! Retrieved November 1, 2011.

A total of 5,338 athletes from 83 countries participated in these Games, competing in 150 events in 17 sports. The bronze medal Iraq's Abdul Wahid Aziz won in men's lightweight weightlifting is the only Olympic medal (Summer or Winter) Iraq has ever won, currently the longest drought for any country who has won at least one Olympic medal. Athletes from 44 countries won at least one medal, leaving 39 countries in blank in the medal table. The Soviet Union won the most gold (43) and overall medals (103). British West Indies, Republic of China, Ethiopia, Ghana, Iraq, Morocco, and Singapore won the first medals in their Olympic history. Medal table The ranking in this table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee, although that organization does not officially recognize global ranking per country. The countries are ranked by the number of gold medals won by the athletes of that country. If countries are tied, first the number of silver medals is taken into consideration and then the number of bronze medals. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. A total of 150 events in 17 sports were awarded in Rome. In gymnastics, two extra gold medals were awarded in the men's pommel horse and long horse vault events because of ties and one additional bronze medal was awarded in the Rings event. Because of this, two fewer silver medals were awarded, though an extra silver was awarded in the women's high jump. In the boxing events, two bronze medals were awarded in each weight class, so the total number of bronze medals is greater than the total number of gold and silver medals.

It also flows for a small way through the English county of Cumbria before entering the Solway. The river rises in the hills to the east of Moffat and its two main tributaries, the Black Esk and the White Esk, merge at the southern end of Castle O'er Forest. It flows south east through Eskdale past Langholm before merging with Liddel Water (which defines the border between Scotland and England. Before passing Longtown the river enters England and merges with the River Lyne and enters the Solway Firth near the mouth of the River Eden. It was formerly one of the boundaries of the Debatable Lands as marked by the Scots' Dike. The Scotland Act 1998 (Border Rivers) Order 1999 provides that functions relating to the management of salmon, trout, eels and freshwater fish in respect of the whole of the River Esk remain with UK ministers: the Border Esk and its tributaries are the only rivers in Scotland where an Environment Agency rod licence is required for angling.  Tributaries  The various tributaries of the Esk are described proceeding downstream. The White Esk arises as the Glendearg and Tomleuchar burns merge then flow south through Eskdalemuir Forest capturing the waters of the Garwald Water at Garwaldwaterfoot then continuing by the village of Eskdalemuir into Castle O'er Forest. It is followed by the B709 road for much of its course. The headwaters of the Black Esk feed into the Black Esk Reservoir, from the foot of whose dam, the Black Esk flows south to Sandyford where it is crossed by the B723 road. It then turns sharply east then southeast passing Castle O'er on its way to meet with the White Esk to form the River Esk. The Meggat Water (not to be confused with Megget Water) is a left bank tributary of the Esk which rises at the southern margin of Craik Forest and flows south, being joined by the Stennies Water before its confluence with the Esk. The Ewes Water is a significant left bank tributary of the Esk which enters the latter at Langholm. Its headwaters, the Eweslees, Mosspaul and Carewoodrig Burns merge and flow southwards as the Ewes Water for several miles, being joined by numerous further burns, the most significant of which is the Meikledale Burn. The valley of the Ewes Water is followed by the A7 road from Carlisle to Edinburgh and by an electricity transmission line. Wauchope Water is a right bank tributary of the Esk which joins immediately downstream from the Ewes Water confluence. It arises as the Logan Water and Bigholms Burn meet 3 miles / 5 km southwest of Langholm. The Tarras Water is a left bank tributary of the Esk which joins it 2.5 miles /4 km south of Langholm. The Liddel Water is a major tributary which enters on the left bank between Canonbie and Longtown. It forms the boundary between Scotland and England for a while as does its tributary, the Kershope Burn. The River Lyne enters on the left bank at Lynefoot just above the normal tidal limit of the estuarial section of the Esk. The River Sark and the Kirtle Water enter the tidal estuary of the Esk to the east and west of Gretna respectively. See main articles on each of these and some of their tributaries.

Born in Odense, his parents were Arthur and Inger Sprog√∏e Petersen. He married Eva Rasmussen in 1945, with whom he had three children. One of these is actor . Career He made his film debut in Hans Store Aften (His Big Night). His characteristically prominent chin that had been feared to be an obstacle of his career did not prevent him from being one of the most versatile and widely used Danish actors. His strength laid in the almost diabolic, mischievous and brash but he effortlessly played meek and shy types as well as elegantiers. Among his many roles on stage in classic plays might be mentioned Mephisto in Faust, the title figure of Strindberg's The Father and some Moli√®re and Bertolt Brecht characters. An extremely popular actor in Denmark, he played many diverse roles, including several recurring television parts. He appeared in 157 films, making him one of the hardest-working actors in the history of Danish film. In his younger years he was often part of a duo with his friend and colleague Dirch Passer. He is probably best known for playing one of the lead roles in the Olsen-banden movies, along with Morten Grunwald and Poul Bundgaard, playing the gang leader Egon Olsen, known for his short temper, striped suit, and cigar. By this role he earned international fame though mostly in Eastern Europe, in the GDR he together with his colleagues became almost a cult figure. Among his TV roles must be mentioned his elegant and humorous ex-burglar Larsen in the series Huset p√• Christianshavn (\\"The House at Christianshavn\\" ‚Äì the first Danish sitcom) and his role as the wise and courageous doctor Louis Hansen in the epic, historical drama-series Matador, both also shown outside Denmark. He was an able singer especially in shows or revues and his interpretation of Tim Spencer's Cigarettes, whiskey and wild wild women (in Danish re-creation: Fandens Oldemor ‚Äì \\"The Devil's Great-Grandmother\\") almost became his signature tune. He was the Danish voice of the Sultan in the dub of Disney's Aladdin. He was an actor who combined great public sympathy with the ability to remain a private person with a modest lifestyle. After his death it was revealed that he had been a passionate art enthusiast and had amassed a valuable collection of modern paintings. Shortly after his death in 2004, Nordisk Film (the company that made the Olsen Gang movies) established a scholarship for actors in his name. The state-owned road to The State Prison in Vridsl√∏selille (the prison where his Egon Olsen character was a frequent \\"guest\\"), was renamed by the municipality of Albertslund to Egon Olsens Vej (Egon Olsen Road). On 24 October 2005, his native city of Odense named a square Ove Sprog√∏es Plads (Ove Sprog√∏e Square) in his honour.

Norwegian Museum of Architecture. The National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design (), also known as the National Museum, in Oslo is a Norwegian state-owned museum. It was established on 1 July 2003 by the merging of the Architecture Museum, Art Industry Museum, National Exhibitions, the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and the National Gallery of Norway . Its directors have been Sune Nordgren (2003‚Äì2006), Anne Kjellberg (acting, 2006‚Äì2007), Allis Helleland (2007‚Äì2008), Ingar Pettersen (acting, 2008‚Äì2009), Audun Eckhoff (2009‚Äì2017) and Karin Hindsbo (2017‚Äìpresent). Chairmen of the board have been Christian Bjelland (2002‚Äì2008), Svein Aaser (2008‚Äì2017) and Linda Bernander Silseth (2017‚Äìpresent). The National Museum collects, preserves, displays, and conveys the country's most extensive collection of art, architecture and design. The collection has up to 400 000 works. The museum holds regular exhibitions of works from their own collection and revolving collections of borrowed and owned works. The museum's exhibition areas in Oslo are Nasjonalgalleriet (National Gallery), Museet for Samtidskunst (Museum of Contemporary Art). It also exhibited at Nasjonalmuseet ‚Äì Arkitektur (National Museum ‚Äì Architecture) and Kunsindustrimuseet (Art industry Museum) until it closed on 17 October 2016. The exhibition programme includes travelling exhibitions from within and outside the country. In 2015 the museum had 602,546 visitors. The current director, Karin Hindsbro, started in 2017. Free entry is available, daily, in late 2019, and every Thursday after that. New building A new building to house the National Museum is being constructed on Vestbanen The building will open in 2020,Det nye Nasjonalmuseet p√• Vestbanen vekker oppsikt: ‚Äì Avvisende, ignorant og introvert The National Gallery is closed temporarily from 13 January 2019 until the new National Museum opens. The gallery will serve as storage for the collections until its move to the new National Museum. The Museum for Contemporary Art was last open on 3 September 2017. A large portion of the collection will be shown at the new National Museum. The contemporary art will for the first time ever be presented in a collection in partnership with design, crafts, and older art. This will be the biggest and most important exhibited collection in Norway. Exhibits will be evaluated, photographed, and conserved before they are packed away and relocated to storage, and eventually to the new museum. This is extensive work and a large part of the preparations for the new National Museum The Art Industry Museum closed on 16 October 2016 due to preparations for the relocation into the new National Museum. The New National Museum at Vestbanen In the spring of 2008 the government decided that the new building for the National Museum would be located at Vestbanen in place of the old Oslo West Station train station at Aker Brygge. It is planned to open in 2020. In November 2010 the German architecture company Kleihues + Schuwerk won the international architecture competition with the project Forum Artis. A cohesive new building was one of the preconceptions for the establishment of the National Museum in 2003. Just ten years after Norway's first public art museum was completed, the museum's administration realized the National Gallery's building was too small, other museum buildings were also in need of bigger more satisfactory premises. The same thing goes for all the exhibitions of the National Museum: Art Industry Museum, the Architecture Museum, and the Museum for Contemporary Art. Architecture competitions for expansion at Tullinl√∏kka were previously held in 1972 and 1995 but didn't lead to anything. In spring 2012 the pre-project was completed and delivered to the culture department. The government presented the project on 22 March 2013 with a price of approximately 5.3 billion Norwegian kroner. On 6 June 2013 the Stortinget decreed the new building to be within a cost frame of 5,327 billion kroner. The new National Museum will have an exhibition area of 13,000 m2 and will be the largest art museum in the Nordic Countries. The National Museum and Statbygg have together established the information centre Mellomstasjonen. Up until the museum opens you can get to know the building project and the plans for the new museum, as well as participate in breakfast meetings, artist's discussions and many other things. The building has been widely derided by critics, who have said it resembles a prison and described it as the \\"national prison.\\"  Collections of the National Museum  =The National Gallery= The National Gallery was established in 1842 as the Norwegian States Central Museum for Visual Arts. Since 1882 its location has been on Universitetsgata in Oslo, in a building designed by Heinrich Ernst and Adolf Schirmer. The building's exterior and interior was listed by Riksantikvaren (Cultural Heritage) in January 2012. Art historian Jens Thiis was director at The National Gallery between 1908 and 1941. Thiis had an international outlook and bought a series of central works for the museum's collection. The museum also received large donations from wealthy heirs Olaf Schou (1909), Christopher Paus (1918), and Chr. Langaard (1922) during this period. Paus, a relative of Henrik Ibsen who lived in Rome, amassed one of the largest collections from classical antiquity in Northern Europe, and turned down an offer from Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek to acquire the collection, instead donating it to the National Gallery where it was meant to become the foundation of a museum or department dedicated to classical antiquity. The museum has a vast collection of Norwegian Romantic Nationalism movement paintings, as well as Edvard Munch's works. The main part of the collection of older art consists of Norwegian paintings and sculptures from the 1800s. Edvard Munch's Scream and some of his other renowned works are among the highlights of the National Gallery's collection. Other significant artists include J.C Dahl, Adolph Tidemand, Hans Gude, Harriet Backer, and Christian Krohg. The collection from the 20th century shows the evolution within Norwegian visual arts with references and key works from Nordic and foreign art within paintings, sculpture, photos, video and other mediums. In 1990 the museum's collection from after 1945 was transferred to the newly established Museum of Contemporary Art. The launch of a new permanent exhibition \\"Everyone is Talking About the Museum\\" in 2005 increased visitor numbers but also had some negative reaction. The most heavily debated decision was to divide the museum's ‚ÄòMunch Room‚Äô and show Munch's works together with other contemporary painters. Another decision was to replace the chronological principle with a thematic one. The permanent exhibition was once again revisited in 2011. ‚ÄòThe Dance of Life: Collections from the Ancients To 1950‚Äô, the Munch Room and the chronological principle has been reinstated. The new permanent exhibition has been praised as ‚Äòa short version of the world‚Äôs art history instead of a revisit of the museum‚Äôs own collection‚Äô. =Graphics and drawing collection= The museum's extensive graphic and drawing collection consists of approximately 50,000 Norwegian and foreign works, and spans from the end of the 1400s to current day. Central artists include Durer, Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Goya, Picasso, Manet, Rafael, Rubens, Muncb, Tidemand, Dahl, Werenskiold, and Kittelsen. Newer Norwegian graphics and drawn art is also well represented. =Museum for Contemporary Art= The Museum for Contemporary Art was established in 1988 and was located at Bankplassen 4 in Oslo. The collection consists of works from the former National Exhibition and National Gallery, including later purchases. The 1907 museum building, designed by Ingvar Hjorth, formerly housed the Norwegian Bank. The museum opened for the public in 1990 and became a part of the National Museum in 2003. The museum has alternating exhibitions in the 2000 m2 facilities. In and outside the museum installations by the artists Per Inge Bj√∏rlo, Inner Space VS. the Goal (1990) and the gallery room is dedicated to Louise Bourgeois. The collection consists of over 5000 Norwegian and foreign works from the period of 1945 to now. Known Norwegian artists within the collection are Anna-Eva Bergman, Leonard Rickhard, Bjarne Melgaard, and Marianne Heske. Known international artists include Mario Merz, Cindy Sherman, Ilya Kabakov, and Isaac Julien. The collection is continually expanding with yearly purchases of art work. =National Museum ‚Äì Architecture= The Architecture Museum was established by the Norwegian Architects National Association in 1975 and became a part of the National Museum 1 July 2003. The building on Kongens Gate 4 was in use up until March 2005. The museum renamed the National Museum ‚Äì Architecture, opened in 2008 at a new location, Bankplassen 3 in Oslo. The museum is located in three separate buildings that are built together. The main building ‚Äì the oldest section ‚Äì was the Norges Banks Christianiaavdeling which was designed by Christian H. Grosch and was finished in 1830. Diagonally behind is Sverre Fehns addition from 2002 ‚Äì the Ulltveit-Moe Pavilion. There is also a storage building from 1911, designed by Henry Bucher. National Museum ‚Äì Architecture shows alternating exhibits from the collection that consists of models, drawing, and photographs. The National Museum has Norway's most important architecture collection, featuring more than 300,000 items dated from the 1830s to current day. The collection highlights and documents different aspects of architectural culture and is mainly made up of private archives or fragments of archives. These span over a large variation of materials and mediums: architectural drawings, photographs, models, conceptual studies, sketchbooks, correspondences and ephemera. The collection's main focus is the 1900s, and names within Norwegian architectural history such as Ove Bang, Blakstad of Munthe, Jan & Jon, Knut Knutsen, Arne Korsmo, Christian Norberg-Schulz, Magnus Poulsson, and Erling Viksj√∏ are well represented. Pritzker Prize winner Sverre Fehns is a highlight of the collection. =Art Industry Museum= The Art Industry Museum is located at St. Olavs gate 1. The building was constructed in 1902 after Kristiania County decided, in 1896, to construct a new building at the then Brandt l√∏kke, on the corner of Ullev√•lsveien and St. Olavs gate. In 1897 they had an architecture competition, and of the 14 proposals the 26-year old architect Adolf Brendo Greve was declared the winner. Due to his young age he asked the more experienced Ingvar Hjorth for assistance. The museum itself was created by the initiative of professor Lorentz Dietrichson and antiquarian Nicolay Nicolaysen in 1876, and the museum was founded by the country that same year. That makes the museum amongst the first in Norway and one of the earliest art industry museums in Europe. This initiative was most likely based on the newly founded state of Norway's need to show themselves as an independent and individual nation. The collection of design and crafts spans from ancient Greek vases and East-Asian art objects to European fashion history. It includes fashion and textiles, furniture, silver, glass, ceramic, design and crafts. The unique Baldishol tapestry from the 1100s, the royal costume collection, N√∏stetangen glass, Norwegian silver and Herreb√∏ earthenware are among the highlights of the collection. =National Exhibitions= This was established in 1953 as a government agency under the culture department, to send travelling exhibitions of Norwegian and Nordic art to other parts of the country. The agency sent out 142 exhibitions in the 34 years it existed. The National Exhibition built up their own collections, as well as borrowed works for their exhibits. The main aim and motto is ‚ÄòArt to the People‚Äô. When the Museum for Contemporary Art was established in 1988, the National Gallery became a part of the museum, from 1992 with the name ‚ÄòRiksutstillinger‚Äô(National Exhibitions). The National Exhibitions was a body for disseminating national art, whose task was to create interest and understanding for visual arts, crafts, photography, design, and architecture. It was a national competence centre for dissemination, exhibition technique and design. National Exhibitions had five departments: administration, programme, dissemination, information, and department for exhibition design. From 1992 to 2005 it also had the function of organizing exhibitions outside the usual ‚Äì such as large exhibitions from other continents (Saana Africa (Art from South-Africa), Fr√•v√¶r (Absence), Vietnam Express, etc.). From 2005 the National Exhibition was disbanded, its dissemination responsibility transferred to Landsdekkende (Nationwide) Program, a part of the National Museum for Art, Architecture, and Design.  Conflicts  The National Museum has from its conception been plagued by conflicts, at administrative, artistic, and political levels. The first director of the museum was Swedish, Sune Nordgrem (from 2003 until August 2006). Norgren stepped down as director after a longer period of professional critique and personal conflicts with the museum. Allis Helleland became the new director in August 2007, under her leadership the conflicts with the museum continued, and she was exposed to criticism from staff and outside environments. She resigned in August 2008. The board constituted Ingar Pettersen as daily manager in autumn 2008, at which point Christian Bjelland (1954), the museum's board director since its conception quit and was replaced by Svein Aaser. The director from 2009 till 2017 was Audun Eckhoff, who was succeeded by Karin Hindsbo.  National Museum‚Äôs Objectives  Purchases and presents Collection work, purchases and donations to the collection are important aspects of the museum's community responsibilities. The museum builds and completes the collections mainly through current national and international organisations. There is a specific focus to gather important works with for a specific artist, period, group, or area of the collection within the collections policy. Conservation One of the museum's most important tasks is making sure the art works within the collection are kept in as good a state as possible. Conservators treat, document, and research the museum's collection of painting, paper, textiles, artwork and design, installations and electronic mediums. An important part of the conservator's work is to investigate and document the condition of works in connection with loans, exhibitions or purchases. Research and development Research and development are part of the museum's core tasks. This activity springs out of and is partly integrated in the museum's artistic activities. The research must be of a high level and up to international standards. During 2010 the current research policies were reevaluated and a long-term plan of action was formed. Published Research An important way to disseminate research that's done at the National Museum is publication. In addition to the yearbook Architecture in Norway and the journal Art and Culture, the museum annually releases a catalogue connected to the exhibitions and collections. The museum staff also contribute in many different ways to other publications. Further information about each publication can be found via the National Museum's library. Kunst og kultur (Arts and Culture) Norway's only scientific journal within art history, Kunst og kultur, is published by the National Museum in collaboration with Universitetsforlaget (The University Press). The purpose of Kunst og kultur is to publish peer-reviewed articles within Norwegian and international art history and current book reviews. Its main subjects are art, crafts, design, and architecture from any period. National Museum's research library The museum's research library includes approximately 165,000 books, exhibition catalogues, and encyclopedias within older and newer visual arts, crafts, design, architecture, and adjacent areas. The library has c. 200 journal titles, a video/DVD collection, and a collection of c. 28,000 slides. The library's collection can be accessed at the library's premises at Kristian Augusts gate 23. Archive The National Museum's archive consists of extensive documentation and research materials. The collection includes archives from public and private sources, as well as a wide range of documentation on Norwegian artists and the museum's own art collection. The archives are available at the library's study hall. The archive also includes an extensive collection of newspaper cuttings. This a systematic collection of clippings focusing on the post-war era till today. Parts of the collection stretches back as far as the 1800s. Digital commitment The museum performs digitisation work of the collections, through the medium of DigitaltMuseum and Google Art Project, which can be accessed online. In the digital archive you can search through 35,000 works and 5,000 artists, architects, and designers. Organisation The National Museum is run by the foundation Nasjonalmuseet for Kunst (National Museum of Art), which was created by the culture and church department of the government on 28 April 2003. The foundation is managed by a board with seven members, whereof three, including the leader, are chosen by the state. The board hires a daily manager for a fixed term and decides their work requirements and paycheck. The daily manager is in charge of the day-to- day work the foundation does in relation to guidelines given by the board.

The keyed trumpet is a brass instrument that makes use of keyed openings in its bore rather than extensions of the length of the bore as the means of playing all the notes of the chromatic scale. The instrument's popularity reached its high-point around the turn of the nineteenth century; but it waned with the emergence of the valved trumpet in the early nineteenth century and it is rarely seen in modern performances. Prior to the invention of the keyed trumpet, the prominent trumpet of the time was the natural trumpet. The keyed trumpet has holes in the wall of the tube that are closed by keys. The experimental E keyed trumpet was not confined to the natural notes, but was chromatic in all registers of the instrument.Geiringer, K and Geiringer, I (1982) Haydn: A Creative Life in Music, p. 324-325 Before this, the trumpet was commonly valveless and could only play a limited range of ‚Äúharmonic‚Äù notes by altering lip pressure. These harmonic notes were clustered in the high registers, so previous trumpet concertos could only play melodies at very high pitches. There is also some discrepancy over who created the E keyed trumpet, as it is claimed that ‚Äúthe Viennese court trumpeter, Anton Weidinger invented the keyed trumpet‚ÄùWarburton, A (1867) Analyses of Musical Classics: Book 2. London, Spottiswoode, Ballantyre and Co Ltd though elsewhere it is insisted that although ‚Äúthe invention of the keyed trumpet has been ascribed to the Viennese, Anton Weidinger, who is said to have constructed it in 1801... the instrument itself is older than that, as Haydn's concerto was written five years earlier.‚Äù Tone Due to its physical characteristics (bore, bell, historical mouthpiece), the keyed trumpet is closer in tone to the natural trumpet than the valved trumpet. It was once said to have sounded like a \\"Demented Oboe... despite Haydn's efforts, the keyed trumpet had no real success- the explanation may be that the holes detracted from the brilliant tone of the instrument.‚Äù Concertos J. Haydn ‚Äì trumpet concerto In 1796 Joseph Haydn wrote his Trumpet Concerto for Anton Weidinger and it was performed on 22 March 1800 at the Imperial and Royal Court Theatre. The piece begins with the broken triads and fanfare motifs common to trumpet music of the time (perhaps as a jibe to the audience who had come to see this exciting new kind of trumpet), but follows with chromatic runs and diatonic melodies not possible on the valveless natural trumpet. The highest note in the Haydn trumpet concerto is high concert D, or high E on a B trumpet, or a high B on E trumpet for which it was written. J. N. Hummel ‚Äì trumpet concerto Like Haydn, Johann Nepomuk Hummel wrote his Trumpet Concerto for Anton Weidinger. It was written and performed in 1803 to mark his entrance into the Esterh√°zy court orchestra in 1804, following Haydn. There are places, primarily in the second movement, where Weidinger is believed to have changed the music because of the execution of the instrument. It is unknown whether this was in agreement with Hummel.

It was the first Olympic Games to take place in twelve years, due to the Second World War (and was known informally as \\"The Austerity Games\\" - largely due to countries having to bring their own food due to shortages in Britain), with London being chosen as the host city in May 1946. London had previously hosted the 1908 Summer Olympics, and was due to have hosted the event in 1944. A record 59 nations were represented by 4,104 athletes, 3,714 men and 385 women, in 19 sport disciplines. Following the Second World War, Germany and Japan remained under military occupation and had not yet formed their National Olympic Committee, and so were not invited.Findling (1996): p. 103 The only major Axis power to take part in the Games was Italy.Findling (1996): p. 111 The Soviet Union was invited to compete, but chose not to send any athletes, sending observers instead to prepare for the 1952 Summer Olympics.Findling (1996): p. 104 Following the threats of a boycott from Arab countries should an Israeli team fly their flag at the opening ceremony, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) excluded Israel from the Games on a technicality.Findling (1996): p. 105 Several countries participated for the first time, including Burma, Ceylon, Lebanon, Puerto Rico and Syria. The Olympic medals themselves were the standard Trionfo design used for the Olympic medals between 1928 and 1968. It was not until 2010 that Belgian Eugene van Roosbroeck received his gold medal for his part in the cycling road race as there was no podium for winners following the race and the team returned to Belgium two days after the event having received no medals.

If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. This information is provided by the IOC. However, the IOC does not recognize or endorse any ranking system. In the gymnastics events there were three athletes placed first for the men's pommel horse, with Paavo Aaltonen, Veikko Huhtanen and Heikki Savolainen all receiving gold medals for Finland in the same event, while no silver or bronze medals were handed out. Meanwhile, in the men's vault, three athletes finished in joint third place and so were awarded a bronze medal each, resulting in five medals being handed out for that one event. Mexico and Peru won their first gold medal.

The 1936 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XI Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event held in Berlin, Germany, from 1 August to 16 August. Berlin had previously been chosen to host the 1916 Summer Olympics, which were subsequently cancelled due to the First World War. The 1936 Games had 3,963 athletes from 49 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participating in a total of 129 events in 19 sports. This was the highest number of nations represented at any Games to date. Athletes from 32 NOCs won medals, of which 21 secured at least one gold medal. As a result, 17 NOCs were left without any medal. The host NOC, Germany, received a total of 89 medals, a record for a united German team, although East Germany broke that record in 1976, 1980 and 1988. A boycott by the United States was suggested due to Germany's National Socialist regime, but it was not implemented. The other NOCs which threatened to boycott the Games for the same reason were the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands. An alternative People's Olympiad was planned to take place in Barcelona, Spain, but was cancelled at the last moment following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War after the athletes had already begun to arrive. The civil war also meant that Spain's NOC did not compete at the 1936 Games. While no NOCs ended up boycotting the Games on anti-Nazi grounds, a multinational Jewish-led boycott of the Games took place, with individual athletes refusing to take part. Also, the IAAFs' refusal to allow athletes from Northern Ireland to compete for the Irish Olympic Council in athletics events led the Irish Free State to boycott. Marjorie Gestring became the youngest Olympic champion ever at the age of 13, winning a gold medal in the women's 3 meter springboard. As Korea was under Japanese rule, Korean athletes who hoped to compete in the Games were required to qualify for the Japanese team. Sohn Kee- chung, competing as Kitei Son, won gold in the marathon, which made him Japan's first gold medalist at these Games and the first Korean ever to win a medal. His fellow countryman Nam Sung-yong won the bronze medal in the same event. Medal table alt=A black and white photograph of a female athlete with short cut hair.

The ranking in this table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a National Olympic Committee have won (a nation is represented at a Games by the associated National Olympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If NOCs are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code. A dead heat in the lightweight section of the weightlifting competition resulted in gold medals being awarded to both Austria's Robert Fein and Egypt's Anwar Mesbah, and resulted in a silver medal not being awarded for that event. A dead heat for third place in the floor competition of the gymnastic events resulted in bronze medals going to both Germany's Konrad Frey and Eugen Mack of Switzerland. This resulted in 130 gold and bronze medals being awarded, but only 128 silver medals.

Left to right: Hiroto Honda, Katsuya Jonouchi, Yugi Mutou (Dark Yugi), Anzu Mazaki, and Ryo Bakura. The Yu-Gi-Oh! series features an extensive cast of characters created by Kazuki Takahashi. The series takes place in a fictional city in Japan called Domino City, in which most of the characters that appear in the series originate. Many plot elements are also influenced by Egypt and Egyptian mythology, and as such, Egyptian characters also appear within the story. The original manga of Yu-Gi-Oh! tells the tale of Yugi Mutou, a timid young boy who loves all sorts of games, but is often bullied around. One day, he solves an ancient artifact known as the Millennium Puzzle, causing his body to play host to a mysterious spirit with the personality of a gambler. From that moment onwards, whenever Yugi or one of his friends is threatened by those with darkness in their hearts, this \\"Dark Yugi\\" shows himself and challenges them to dangerous \\"Shadow Games\\" which reveal the true nature of someone's heart, the losers of these contests often being subjected to a dark punishment called a \\"Penalty Game\\". As the series progresses, Yugi and his friends (Katsuya Jonouchi, Anzu Mazaki, Hiroto Honda, Miho Nosaka (in the 1998 series), and later Ryo Bakura) learn that this other Yugi inside of his puzzle is actually the spirit of a nameless Pharaoh from Egyptian times who had lost his memories. As Yugi and his companions attempt to help the Pharaoh regain his memories, they find themselves going through many trials as they wager their lives facing off against others that wield the mysterious Millennium Items and the dark power of the Shadow Games. The Japanese names in Western order (given name before family name) and English manga names are listed first and the English anime names are listed second, when applicable. Main characters ; : : :One of the main protagonists of the story. He wears the , one of the seven Millennium Items and an ancient Egyptian artifact holding the spirit of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. He fears the other personality inside him at first; however, as the narrative progresses, he grows a strong bond with his other self and considers his other soul a close and valuable friend. Several defining character moments for him was when he defeats antagonists without Dark Yugi's help in games under bleak circumstances, proving that he is truly worthy of being the Millennium Puzzle's wielder. ; : :Yugi's close friend. Jonouchi is loyal, heroic, good-natured, brave, funny, friendly, kind- hearted, and loving. When Ushio beats up Jonouchi and Honda, Yugi stands up for them, and it's then that Jonouchi realizes that he was jealous of Yugi's \\"treasure\\" all along. Later on that night, he retrieves the last Millennium Puzzle piece and brings it back to Yugi's house, where Yugi completes it and challenges Ushio to the first Shadow Game of the series. Jonouchi is touched by Yugi's behavior towards him and they become loyal friends, forming his own \\"treasure.\\" :Jonouchi is good at fist fighting and is usually able to take on people bigger than him, such as Bandit Keith (in the second anime, this quality is underplayed). Though not exactly the best gamer in Domino, he develops a better liking to them thanks to Yugi, and he's managed to use his strong points to help Yugi come through in earlier story lines. Later on, he develops an interest in the Duel Monsters game, the latest fad at the time. Though unskilled at first, with Yugi's help, he trains for the Duelist Kingdom and Battle City tournaments for his sister; progressively getting better throughout the series to the point where he could be called a match for Dark Yugi. Jonouchi is shown to have a very kind heart, selfless and caring, considerate, and eager willingness to help and save those he deeply cares for and loves, but he also demonstrates a near lack of modesty and can be rather rash at times, making him a source of comic relief. He also has an extreme fear of ghosts, mummies, and anything else that could be considered 'creepy'. Jonouchi notes that, before he met Yugi, he was never really motivated for anything. As the story progressed, he learned to channel his anger into games instead of his fists. ; : :Yugi's childhood best friend and an extremely supportive girl with a lot of spirit for her friends, who has a crush on Atem. Anzu is not an avid game-player and her ability is well below that of Yugi, though she exhibits some knowledge of video game RPGs during the Monster World arc. Her dueling ability is decent and she used to defeat Jonouchi in school before he became a seasoned duelist. She is athletic, has a strong school spirit, and secretly worked at a fast food restaurant called Burger World to save money; her secret dream is to attend a dancing school abroad in New York. When Yugi and Jonouchi find out about these secrets when they followed her (thinking she is taking part in Enjo k≈çsai), she gains a new respect for Jonouchi and her childhood friend, who are more than willing to support her dream and keep her secret. ; : :Honda, who is in class 1-B at Domino High School, is a boy who became a friend of Yugi, Jonouchi, and Anzu. Later on, he becomes a friend to Bakura as well. In the manga, Honda starts out as Jonouchi's street thug buddy and also (at first) has a crush on Miho Nosaka. In the 1998 anime, he is the head of the school's beautician department. Along with Jonouchi, he was saved from the bully Ushio by Yugi, though he still dislikes Yugi at first. After admitting his love for Miho Nosaka to Jonouchi, he is convinced by him to ask Yugi for his help in writing a love letter to her in the form of a puzzle. When the vain teacher Ms. Chono confiscated the puzzle, threatening to punish Miho if the secret admirer does not come clean, Yugi and Jonouchi stood up for him by saying they were the ones who wrote it. Ms. Chono decides to put together the puzzle to find out who the sender is anyway, and Dark Yugi secretly turns it into a Shadow Game, shattering Ms. Chono's pretty face as the Penalty Game. From then on, Honda warms up to Yugi and becomes one of his dearest friends, despite the fact that Miho later turns him down when he asks her out directly. :In the English version of the Duel Monsters anime, his past was heavily edited, to remove the violent fighting bits, and his importance is slightly down-played. In the Duel Monsters anime, he has a large crush on Jonouchi's sister Shizuka and his origin story with Miho is never mentioned. He also has a strong rivalry in the English version with Duke Devlin and regularly competes with him for Serenity's affections. ; : :A transfer student (British in 4Kids' portrayal) who becomes friends with the main group of the story. Like Yugi, he is also interested in games, particularly tabletop role-playing games like . Bakura, the holder of the , has a dark spirit dwelling inside himself, much like Dark Yugi. Before he is introduced to the story, he was constantly moving schools and isolating himself due to the fact that, every time he played a game with his friends, his friends would end up in a coma. This is revealed to be Dark Bakura inflicting Penalty Games on them, which trapped their souls into RPG miniature figures. Together with Yugi and his friends, they join forces to crush Dark Bakura in a Shadow Game of Monster World. From then on, the normal Bakura joins the main group in many of their conflicts. Despite the danger, Bakura continues to hold onto the Millennium Ring, remaining deeply curious about its history. This, along with his trusting and innocent nature, sometimes brings him into conflict with the others and also allows Dark Bakura to continually possess him without his knowledge. Prior to meeting Yugi and his friends, Bakura's sister, Amane, died in a car accident. (This detail is omitted from the second series.) Bakura misses her very much, and often writes letters to her in heaven. The first animated series also included the character Miho Nosaka, who had a crush on Bakura. In the Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters anime, his role in the group is greatly reduced compared to the manga, as he is mostly being controlled by Dark Bakura and doesn't accompany Yugi and his friends as much as he did in the manga, and is excluded from filler arcs. In addition, he is introduced in the middle of the Duelist Kingdom story as someone they merely knew from school, as opposed to being a close friend, and his love for tabletop role-playing games has been greatly written out. ; : :The current President and CEO of the Kaiba Corporation, Kaiba was first introduced as a prodigious, cold-hearted gamer who stopped at nothing to achieve his goals, even resorting to seemingly killing his opponents. He lived a bad childhood because of his good for nothing stepfather. When Kaiba learned that Yugi's grandfather possesses a \\"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\\" card, he ends up dueling Yami Yugi and lost while ending up in a coma after Yami used his power to momentarily shatter Kaiba's heart to purge it of his evil. Though reformed, later learning his rival's identity to be Atem, Kaiba retains his arrogance and rivalry with Yugi. While Kaiba leaves the story following the Battle City arc, he appears in the anime adaption as a major character and has been mentioned in sequel Yu-Gi-Oh! GX series as the founder of Duel Academy. :In the movie Dark Side of Dimensions and its prequel manga chapters, he is revealed to have developed Solid Vision. Kaiba attempted to bring back Atem to settle things between them, which causes much of the storyline to occur before he departed to the afterlife after Atem. Kaiba uses a Blue-Eyes deck and his ace monster is Blue-Eyes White Dragon. ; : :Seto Kaiba's younger brother and an expert at . In the manga, Mokuba is characterized as a spoiled brat, always trying to trick Yugi Muto to get back at him for defeating his older brother. In the pre-Death-T chapters of the manga, Mokuba tries to defeat Yugi before Kaiba has a chance to, threatening to cut off Yugi's fingers if he wins, and challenges Jonouchi and Yugi to a and poisons Jonouchi. In Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters, Mokuba is eternally devoted to his brother Seto Kaiba and is constantly by his side. He is not as violent as his manga counterpart, and is not committed to avenge Seto's defeat. He befriends Yugi's group after they rescue him, thus making him the warmer, more sociable one of the two brothers. ; : :A one-shot minor character in the manga, who was re-written as a main character for the 1998 Toei anime adaptation. Here, she is a very good friend of Yugi and the best friend of Anzu. This version of Miho is a cheerful, kind, and caring girly girl who loves all things that are cute, her friends, and is one of the school's treasures (according to Honda). Miho tends to talk in third person and has gotten crushes on many of the male cast members throughout the show (particularly ones she deems cool) but is not interested in Honda in any way other than as a friend (whereas he is madly in love with her). Miho has a stubborn side, and whenever her friends are threatened, she will not hesitate to get serious and do whatever she can to protect them like when Warashibe poisons Anzu, Honda, and Jonouchi. While Miho is overall sweet and innocent, she is shown to be smarter than she lets on and has a manipulative side to her and is not above letting her desires be known in front of Honda, who she knows has a huge crush for her. This includes him waiting in line to buy her a collectible watch, waiting in line for perfume, and making it sound like she was considering taking him on a trip with her if he won her a digital pets contest. While this would imply a lack of care for Honda, Miho is shown to love him dearly (just not in a romantic way) as when she thought he'd died she began sobbing uncontrollably and resolved to fight for his sake. When she finds out he is alive, she teams up with Jonouchi to fight against Ryuichi and Aileen who were keeping Honda and Yugi's grandfather captive. Antagonists ; : :A dark spirit dwelling inside of the Millennium Ring, Dark Bakura seeks the Millennium items to open the Door of Darkness, which grants evil power to anyone that opens it. To do so, he takes control over Bakura's body against Bakura's will, since he doesn't have a body of his own. In the beginning of the story, he torments Bakura by taking over his body whenever he played a game with his friends and used Penalty Games to trap their souls into TRPG miniatures for the Monster World game, causing Bakura to constantly transfer schools. With the help of Yugi and Yugi's other self, Jonouchi, Anzu, and Honda (and Miho in the 1998 anime), they were able to temporarily purge Dark Bakura's influence on their friend by defeating the final boss of Monster World, . However, later on when the group is seemingly going to be trapped within the labyrinth below Duelist Kingdom, the spirit's voice within the Millennium Ring tricks Bakura into putting it on again, assuring Bakura that his other half will help save his friends and that the dark spirit has undergone a change of heart. With Bakura's friends unaware that he had once again put on the Millennium Ring, Dark Bakura helps Yami Yugi in his game designed to outwit the Meikyuu Brothers' trickery and they head to the surface. :For a while in the manga, it was unknown whether or not Dark Bakura was still a malevolent spirit. On one hand, he occasionally helped Yugi and his friends, trying to gain their uneasy trust and seemed to allow Bakura more free control of his body compared to his earlier treatment of his host (who was still unaware of what transpires whenever his other half took over). On the other hand, unbeknownst to the others, he is shown to be the one that killed Pegasus by tearing the Millennium Eye out of his eye socket and taking it for himself, licking the leftover blood. It's soon clear where his true standing was in the Dungeon Dice Monsters arc: after giving Yugi morale support during the game against Ryuji Otogi and helping him retrieve the pieces of the shattered Millennium Puzzle, Dark Bakura secretly plants a portion of his soul into one of the pieces to uncover the True Door from within, and intends to do anything he can to manipulate everything into place until the day comes where all of the Millennium Items have gathered together, in preparation for the , with the ultimate goal of opening the Door of Darkness and unleashing the darkness sealed within the Puzzle. Unbeknownst to Bakura, throughout the later portion of the manga, his other self will occasionally take over his body whenever he sees the chance of furthering his own selfish goals. During the final arc, Dark Bakuta is an entity created when the soul of merged with a fragment of the dark god Zorc Necrophades after both were sealed inside the Millennium Ring. He is defeated for good when Yami Yugi/Atem summons Horakthy, the Creator of Light to destroy Zorc (in the anime, Dark Bakura became a part of Zorc and was destroyed by Horakthy, while in the manga, his life was linked to Akhenaden's and Zorc's and was killed when Zorc died). ; :/ Dameon Clarke (English) :The eccentric American Chairman of Industrial Illusions (shortened to I¬≤) and the creator of the game (originally ). He is the wielder of the . In the original manga, it's his story about meeting Shadi and the supposed \\"evil intelligence\\" of the Millennium Items that prompts Yami Yugi's search for the answer of who he is and where he came from. During his final Shadow Game with Yugi/Dark Yugi, he tells them of his discovery of an ancient Egyptian Shadow Game during his travels in the Valley of the Kings, which inspired his creation of Duel Monsters and the creation of card games in general, such as tarot cards. In the second anime, as the creator of the card game Duel Monsters and the discoverer of their ancient Egyptian roots, Pegasus often plays a key role due to his extensive knowledge of the game and its mysterious origins. He has a habit of calling Yugi Mutou \\"Yugi-boy\\" and Seto Kaiba \\"Kaiba-boy\\". This trend continues in the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX anime, calling Jaden Yuki \\"Jaden-boy\\". Pegasus often uses English words interspliced with Japanese, including English words like \\"goodness gracious!\\" and \\"snap!\\" and using the English pronoun \\"you\\" instead of Japanese second-person words. His speech is also unique in terms of pronunciation. In both English and Japanese he tends to elongate vowel sounds, especially near the end of a sentence. :Pegasus quickly establishes himself as the manga's fourth main antagonist (and the second anime adaptation's first main antagonist), challenging Yugi to a Shadow Game in order to force him to come to his tournament and face him, taking the soul of his grandfather Sugoroku Mutou as a Penalty Game for losing the timed match to ensure this. Throughout the battles to get to Pegasus's castle, Yugi is seen talking to his grandfather through the use of a camcorder. In the second anime, he traps Sugoroku in a Soul Prison Duel Monsters card. Pegasus also kidnaps Mokuba to convince his brother Seto Kaiba to come as well, later capturing their souls as well. Through a series of flashbacks, Pegasus is revealed to have had a lover, , who died after her 17th birthday (she dies after their marriage in the anime). Although the exact details vary from medium to medium, his actions were all carried out in the hopes of resurrecting her. He is eventually defeated in a final game of Duel Monsters by Yugi and Dark Yugi at the end of the arc, and is obliged to release his victims' souls. He is murdered soon after by Dark Bakura and his millennium item is taken. In the Duel Monsters anime, he isn't killed by Dark Bakura's attack and makes brief appearances in later seasons. ; :An antagonist exclusive to the manga. He is the owner of the game shop across the street from Sugoroku Mutou's Kame Game shop. Long ago, Mr. Otogi asked Sugoroku Muto, a master gamer, to take him in as a disciple. After a while, they challenged each other for the ownership of the Millennium Puzzle in a Shadow Game called the Devil's Board Game. Mr. Otogi, who lost, aged 50 years in a single night as a Penalty Game. Since then he desired revenge through his son Ryuji (known as Duke Devlin in the English anime). In the anime adaption, his character is excluded entirely. He makes an appearance in The Dark Side of Dimensions, a film set in the manga continuity, where he has opened up a cafe with Ryuji to replace of the burnt down Black Clown shop. :In the English Dungeon Dice Monsters video game, he is given the name Sindin the Clown. ; : :The heir to a clan of tombkeepers and the younger brother of Ishizu Ishtar. Marik's hatred of the nameless Pharaoh compels him to disregard his duties and turn to a life of crime, as well as developing a split personality, during his childhood after he underwent the tombkeeper's initiation ritual (which burned a key to the Pharaoh's memory on his back with a hot dagger) and was forever destined for a confined life in the darkness apart from the rest of the world. After breaking one of the laws of their clan, his dark personality emerged and brutally murdered his father (sent him to the Shadow Realm in the English anime); however his adoptive older brother Rishid (known as Odion in the English version of the anime adaptation) managed to seal his dark side away, leaving him with no memory of his actions. He believed that the Pharaoh had his father killed and became obsessed with killing the Pharaoh to avenge his father and put an end to the suffering of his clan, never knowing about his other personality. To this end, he created the Rare Hunters, a gang of thieves who stole and collect rare Duel Monsters cards, and uses his Millennium Rod to control people's minds. Although he was originally innocent and kind as a child, he became very cruel and uncaring; killing his servants when they displeased him and developing a love for torturing people. :Dark Marik eventually is able to reemerge and take control of the normal Marik's body later on in the story and replaces him as the main antagonist. Dark Marik proves to be even more vicious than the original Marik. While the real Marik enjoyed violence and cruelty, he would only use it when he was angry or when it would further his own desires, but his dark side would attack anyone who crossed his path and would prolong their suffering for as long as possible; in the manga and Japanese Duel Monsters anime, he explicitly stated that he liked killing people because it was \\"fun\\" and \\"was the only thing that bought him happiness\\". He only cares for his own survival and actively tries to kill the normal Marik so he can have sole possession of their body. He also dislikes Rishid for sealing him away and actively tries to kill him too, although he keeps missing the chance. While he is connected to the Millennium Rod, Dark Marik differs from Dark Yugi and Dark Bakura in that he is an inhuman entity born from Marik Ishtar's pain and despair and can exist on his own without a host. (He explains that Dark Yugi would cease to exist if Yugi were destroyed, but the normal Marik's destruction wouldn't affect him.) Although not explicitly stated, it is hinted in the manga that he manipulated Marik into committing some of his later crimes, as he told Dark Yugi that he \\"took away\\" Marik's guilt for the things he did. Following Marik's surrender against Yugi, Dark Marik is destroyed. ;Yako Tenma (Â§©È¶¨ Â§úË°å, Tenma Yak≈ç) :The k≈çhai (prot√©g√©) and adopted son (often mistaken, or mistranslated as younger brother) of Maximillion Pegasus (Pegasus J. Crawford in the Japanese version) who wants revenge for Pegasus' defeat. ; : :The guardian of the Millennium Eye and the brother of King Ahknemkhanen. As they grew up, he was secretly jealous of his brother's position as pharaoh, considering himself the true power behind the throne. Using the Shadow Alchemy inscribed in the , he ordered the massacre at the village of Kul Elna, using their blood and melting their corpses into gold so he could create the Millennium Items to defend his brother's kingdom, keeping the slaughter a secret and brainwashing his soldiers in order to keep it that way. To protect his family from anyone seeking revenge, he abandoned his wife and his son, Seto. Seto later entered Pharaoh Atem's court as a priest, but Akhenaden kept their relationship a secret. Seeing how his son had flourished after he abandoned him, Akhenaden's desire became to see Seto achieve power. Through Zorc's influence within his Millennium Eye, he is slowly convinced that he needed to kill the Pharaoh and make a contract with Zorc to become the . :In the manga, Akhenaden's soul is merged with Zorc's and sealed inside the Millennium Puzzle along with Atem, and released during the final arc. His mummy is then used as a second player on Dark Bakura's side of the Shadow RPG, influencing his own playing piece as the game's recreation of the events went on. When Atem wins the game, the mummy's skull is split in half, indicating that Zorc's soul has been vanquished for good. In the second anime series, when Dark Bakura planted a portion of his soul into his Millennium Eye, Akhenaden's mind became corrupted. He would later collected the remaining items he created (in place of Dark Bakura who still uses freeze hourglass awhile) and granted him a power from Zorc by transforming into the High Priest of Darkness (Great Shadow Magus in the English dub). He would later sealed the White Dragon just before he was killed by his own son Seto. As his soul would enter Seto's mind to kill the Pharaoh, this was stopped and killed for good by Kisara in her White Dragon form (Akhenaden was sent to the Shadow Realm afterwards). The purified soul of Akhenaden is later seen alongside his brother on the other side of the door to the afterlife when Atem walks through it. ; :A destroyer of worlds that was born from the darkness in humans' hearts (in the English anime dub, he is the creator of the Shadow Realm). He is summoned by Akhenaden by the power of the Millennium Items and attacks the kingdom, dispatching Atem's advisers. In the Memory World, an RPG-style Shadow Game that Dark Bakura has set up based on ancient Egypt, Zorc is the game's final boss and has three Ba gauges, and if Dark Yugi loses the Shadow RPG, Dark Bakura would gain the ultimate powers of darkness and Zorc would effectively be summoned once again. However, with the help of Yugi and his other dear friends, Atem defeats him and stops him from being resurrected, also freeing Bakura from the Millennium Ring once and for all. Dark Bakura was an entity made of both Zorc and Thief King Bakura's souls, and in the manga there is also an entity made of both Zorc and Priest Akhenaden's souls who calls himself Zorc Necrophades, High Priest of Darkness. =Minor antagonists= ; :A deranged theme park created by Seto Kaiba in attempt to kill Yugi Mutou using deadly games, and hiring deadly opponents.

When Dark Yugi intends to bet his own life to even out stakes in order to win back Mai's star chips, this Player Killer ties a noose around Dark Yugi's neck, threatening to kill him once he wins. Because of this, Dark Yugi turns the duel into a Shadow Game, at one point, claiming he would win in five more turns. During the duel, Dark Yugi showed the Player Killer illusions of the impending Penalty Game, in which the Player Killer was walking up the gallows' stairs each turn closer to the five turn limit Dark Yugi claimed that he would win within. Once the Player Killer loses the Shadow Game, Dark Yugi inflicts the \\"Darkness of Naraku\\" Penalty Game on him, where the Player Killer imagines himself being hung from the gallows and galling into the abyss. In the anime, the penalty of the game is changed so that fire is shot at the loser. When the Player Killer attempts to do this to Dark Yugi even after losing, Dark Yugi's magic shields him from harm. He then performs a Mind Crush on the Player Killer.

It was this particular skill that Seto appealed to when Gozaburo visited the orphanage where he and Mokuba were living, as he challenged Gozaburo to a game of chess, with the stakes being the adoption of the two brothers. Seto won by cheating, and Gozaburo adopted Seto and Mokuba, but proved a cruel father, forcing Seto to spend all his time studying in order to groom him as his new heir.

The western Snake River Plain is a large tectonic graben or rift valley filled with several kilometers of lacustrine (lake) sediments; the sediments are underlain by rhyolite and basalt, and overlain by basalt. The western plain began to form around 11‚Äì12 Ma (million years ago) with the eruption of rhyolite lavas and ignimbrites. The western plain is not parallel to North American Plate motion and lies at a high angle to the central and eastern Snake River Plains. Its morphology is similar to other volcanic plateaus such as the Chilcotin Group in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Location of Yellowstone Hotspot in Millions of Years Ago The eastern Snake River Plain traces the path of the North American Plate over the Yellowstone hotspot, now centered in Yellowstone National Park. The eastern plain is a topographic depression that cuts across Basin and Range mountain structures, more or less parallel to North American Plate motion. It is underlain almost entirely by basalt erupted from large shield volcanoes. Beneath the basalts are rhyolite lavas and ignimbrites that erupted as the lithosphere passed over the hotspot. The central Snake River plain is similar to the eastern plain but differs by having thick sections of interbedded lacustrine (lake) and fluvial (stream) sediments, including the Hagerman fossil beds. Island Park and Yellowstone Calderas formed as the result of enormous rhyolite ignimbrite eruptions, with single eruptions producing up to of ash. Henry's Fork Caldera, measuring by , may be the largest symmetrical caldera in the world. The caldera formed when a dome of magma built up and then drained away. The center of the dome collapsed, leaving a caldera. Henry's Fork Caldera lies within the older and larger Island Park Caldera, which is by . Younger volcanoes that erupted after passing over the hotspot covered the plain with young basalt lava flows in places, including Craters of the Moon National Monument. Effects on climate Moisture ChannelPrecip Map Natural vegetation on the Snake River Plain near Twin Falls The Snake River Plain has a significant effect on the climate of Yellowstone National Park and the adjacent areas to the south and west of Yellowstone. Over time, the Yellowstone hotspot left a wide channel through the Rocky Mountains. This channel is in line with the gap between the Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada. The result is a moisture channel extending from the Pacific Ocean to Yellowstone. Moisture from the Pacific Ocean streams onshore in the form of clouds and humid air. It passes through the gap between the Sierra and Cascades and into the Snake River Plain where it is channeled through most of the Rocky Mountains with no high plateaus or mountain ranges to impede its progress.Bryson, R. A. and Hare, F.K. 1974 Climates of North America, Survey of Climatology, Vol. 11 Elsevier, New York p 422 It finally encounters upslope conditions at the head of the Snake River Valley at Ashton, Idaho; at Island Park, Idaho; at the Teton Range east of Driggs, Idaho; and at the Yellowstone Plateau of Yellowstone National Park where the channeled moisture precipitates out as rain and snow.Mock, C. J., 1996 Climatic controls and spatial variations of precipitation in the western United States, Journal of Climate, 9:1111-1125 The result is a localized climate on the eastern side of the Rockies that is akin to a climate on the west slope of the Cascades or the northern Sierra. The head of the Snake River Valley, the Tetons, and the Yellowstone Plateau receive much more precipitation than other areas of the region, and the area is known for being wet, green, having many streams, and having abundant snow in winter. Although the topography of the Plain has largely gone unchanged for several million years, this region's climate has not been so constant. Current climatic conditions began to characterize the region in the early Pleistocene (approximately 2.5 million years ago). However, the arid climate of today was born from the gradual dissipation of a climate defined by greater moisture and narrower ranges of annual temperatures.

He is known primarily for his paintings of religious subjects. He was a leading exponent of the neoclassical style of Parisian Atticism. Training and career He was born in Paris, where he spent his entire life. His father, Cathelin Le Sueur, a turner and sculptor in wood, placed him with Vouet, in whose studio he rapidly distinguished himself. Admitted at an early age into the guild of master-painters, he left them to take part in establishing the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1648 and was elected as one of the original twelve elders in charge of its administration.M√©moires pour servir √† l'histoire de l'Acad√©mie royale de Peinture et de Sculpture depuis 1648 jusqu'en 1664, Ed. Anatole de Montaiglon, Paris 1853, vol. I, p. 36. Rape of Tamar, 1640 Some paintings, illustrative of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, which were reproduced in tapestry, brought him notice, and his reputation was further enhanced by a series of decorations (Louvre) in the mansion of Lambert de Thorigny, which he left uncompleted, for their execution was frequently interrupted by other commissions. Amongst these were several pictures for the apartments of the king and queen in the Louvre, which are now missing, although they were entered in Bailly's inventory (1710); but several works produced for minor patrons have come down to us. In the gallery of the Louvre are the Angel and Hagar, from the mansion of De Tonnay Charente; Tobias and Tobit, from the Fieubet collection; several pictures executed for the church of Saint Gervais; the Martyrdom of St Lawrence, from Saint Germain de l'Auxerrois; two very fine works from the destroyed abbey of Marmoutiers; St Paul preaching at Ephesus, one of Le Sueur's most complete and thorough performances, painted for the goldsmiths corporation in 1649; and his famous series of the Life of St Bruno, executed in the cloister of the Chartreux. These last have more personal character than anything else Le Sueur produced, and much of their original beauty survives in spite of injuries and restorations and removal from the wall to canvas. Le Sueur was a prolific draftsman and many of his chalk drawings are in the Louvre‚Äôs Cabinet des Dessins. His pupils, who aided him much in his work, were his wife's brother, Theodore Gouss√©, and three brothers of his own, as well as Claude Lef√®bvre and Pierre Patel the landscape painter. Most of his works have been engraved, chiefly by Picart, B. Audran, Leclerc, Drevet, Chauveau, Poilly and Desplaces. Style According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, it was considered that Le Sueur's work lent itself readily to the engraver's art, as he had a delicate perception of varied shades of grave and elevated sentiment, and possessed the power to render them. His graceful facility in composition was always restrained by a very fine taste, but his works often fail to please completely, because, producing so much, he had too frequent recourse to conventional types, and partly because he rarely saw colour except with the cold and clayey quality proper to the school of Vouet; yet his St Paul at Ephesus and one or two other works show that he was not naturally deficient in this sense, and whenever we get direct reference to nature‚Äîas in the monks of the St Bruno series‚Äîwe recognize his admirable power to read and render physiognomy of varied and serious type.Guillet de St Georges, Mm. mid.; C Blanc, Histoire des peintres; Vitet, Catalogue des tableaux du Louvre; d'Argenville, Vies des peintres Notes References * External links *Life of St. Bruno gallery at the Louvre Category:1617 births Category:1655 deaths Category:French Baroque painters ","title":"Eustache Le Sueur"},{"id":"921243","text":"This is the full medal table of the 1924 Summer Olympics which were held in Paris, France.

The name of the river is from Old English (ƒìa- gem≈çt) and is a back formation from Eamont Bridge which means the junction of streams. The river is formed by the outflow from Ullswater in the Lake District, later augmented by Dacre Beck from the west and the River Lowther which carries the water from Haweswater north to the Eamont at Penrith. It reaches the Eden east of Penrith. The river has flooded on numerous occasions, with the most recent being when Storm Desmond hit in December 2015. During the flooding, 300-year old Pooley Bridge was washed away and a temporary bridge had to be installed to reconnect the two halves of the village. The same storm caused damage to the grade I listed Eamont Bridge, but after masonry work, it re-opened in March 2016. In April 2019 preparatory works began for replacing the temporary bridge with a new bridge. The crossing is to be closed from September 2019 until Easter 2020, while the new bridge is installed.

They were adopted by the majority of the provinces of Canada, and became the basis for the London Conference of 1866. Some of the major points that were addressed in the resolutions are as follows: Canada will have a strong central government (federal government), the central government is to be responsible for the legislation of peace, order and good government, provinces will have defined powers and will be accountable for handling local affairs and social and cultural issues, the United Province of Canada (as they called it), will be split into Quebec and Ontario, a federal government will be composed of two law making houses. These are just five of the important acts used to construct Canada as it is today. The Resolutions The 72 resolutions were (all 72 of them): 1\\\\. The best interests and present and future prosperity of British North America will be promoted by a Federal Union under the Crown of Great Britain, provided such Union can be effected on principles just to the several Provinces. 2\\\\. In the Federation of the British North American Provinces, the system of Government best adapted under existing circumstances to protect the diversified interest of the several Provinces, and secure efficiency, harmony and permanency in the working of the Union, would be a general Government, charged with matters of common interest to the whole country; and Local Governments for each of the Canadas, and for the Provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, charged with the control of local matters in their respective sections. Provision being made for the admission into the Union, on equitable terms, of Newfoundland, the North-West Territory, British Columbia and Vancouver. 3\\\\. In framing a Constitution for the General Government, the Conference, with a view to the perpetuation of our connection with the Mother Country, and to the promotion of the best interests of the people of these Provinces, desire to follow the model of the British Constitution, so far as our circumstances will permit. 4\\\\. The Executive Authority or Government shall be vested in the Sovereign of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and be administered according to the well-understood principles of the British Constitution, by the Sovereign personally, or by the Representative of the Sovereign duly authorized. 5\\\\. The Sovereign or Representative of the Sovereign shall be Commander- in-Chief of the Land and Naval Militia Forces. 6\\\\. There shall be a General Legislature or Parliament for the Federated Provinces, composed of a Legislative Council and a House of Commons. 7\\\\. For the purpose of forming the Legislative Council, the Federated Provinces shall be considered as consisting of three divisions: 1st Upper Canada, 2nd Lower Canada, 3rd Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island; each division with an equal representation in the Legislative Council. 8\\\\.

For the purpose of such re-adjustments, Lower Canada shall always be assigned sixty-five members, and each of the other sections shall at each re- adjustment receive, for the ten years then next succeeding, the number of Members to which it will be entitled on the same ratio of representation to population as Lower Canada will enjoy according to the Census last taken by having sixty-five Members. 21\\\\. No reduction shall be made in the number of Members returned by any section, unless its population shall have decreased, relatively to the population of the whole Union, to the extent of five per centum. 22\\\\. In computing at each decennial period the number of Members to which each section is entitled, no fractional parts shall be considered, unless when exceeding one-half the number entitling to a Member, in which case a Member shall be given for each such fractional part. 23\\\\. The Legislature of each Province shall divide such Province into the proper number of constituencies, and define the boundaries of each of them. 24\\\\.

Development In November 1997, Pilatus flew a modified PC-7 Mk.II in order to test improvements for a prospective next generation turboprop trainer. As a result of these tests, Pilatus elected to fund the development of a new training system in November 1998; development of the new trainer, designated as the PC-21, formally started in January 1999. The PC-21 would be developed and certified as a completely new training system, aimed at meeting future military customers' specifications in terms of capability and life-cycle costs for the next three decades. A key aim for the PC-21 was to allow jet aircraft pilots to perform the majority of their training using the type before converting to jet-powered types, allowing operators to make substantial savings. In order to achieve this aim, the new trainer was required to have an expanded performance envelope in terms of aerodynamics, cockpit equipment, flexibility, and ease of maintenance.Hoyle, Craig. \\"Switzerland special: Pilatus the success story.\\" Flight International, 17 March 2008.\\"The NextGen Trainer.\\" Pilatus Aircraft, Retrieved: 22 March 2016.\\"PC-21 set to revolutionise training for air forces.\\" Flight International, 22 July 2002. In May 2002, Pilatus announced that it aimed for the PC-21 to capture 50% of the global trainer aircraft market between 2005 and 2030.Wastnage, Justin. \\"Pilatus aims for half of trainer sales with PC-21.\\" Flight International, 7 May 2002. From the start of the aircraft's development, Pilatus aimed for the type to have a predictable cost profile over its full lifespan. To meet this goal, the firm chose to incorporate modern materials, an innovative design concept, and full-scale fatigue analysis. Additionally, accompanying the aircraft itself are integrated training systems to meet the pilot's needs; the full package offered by Pilatus includes synthetic training devices, computer- based training, and classroom instruction. As a result of greater training effectiveness, pilots can graduate with fewer total training hours, reaching the frontline faster and at lower cost. In addition to pilots, various prospective aircrew, such as navigators, weapons officers, and electronic warfare operators, can be trained using the type's embedded simulation/emulation system. On 30 April 2002, the rollout of the first PC-21 prototype was performed at Pilatus' factory in Stans, Switzerland; this aircraft conducted its first flight on 1 July of the same year.\\"Pilatus flies PC-21 and aims for certification in 2004.\\" Flight International, 9 July 2002. In May 2003, Pilatus management formally green-lit the program to proceed to full development. On 7 June 2004, a second PC-21 prototype, the construction of which had been delayed to incorporate improvements learnt from assembling the first, made its maiden flight. In December 2004, Switzerland's Federal Office for Civil Aviation granted type certification for the PC-21; civil certification was attained despite it being a military aircraft as this permitted civil maintenance procedures to be used as well as allowing the aircraft to be supplied under private finance arrangements. Individual Swiss military certification for equipment such as ejection seats has been applied as necessary.Collins, Peter. \\"FLIGHT TEST: Pilatus PC-21 ‚Äì Fast learner.\\" Flight International, 2 December 2008.

Design A PC-21 on static display, 2009 The Pilatus PC-21 is an advanced single-engine trainer aircraft; it is often referred to by Pilatus as being the \\"Twenty-first Century Trainer\\". The type can be applied for various training capacities, including basic flying training, advanced flight training, full mission management training, and embedded simulation/emulation. In order to perform these functions, the aircraft possesses a powerful, flexible, and cost-effective integrated training system; providing sufficient ease of use for inexperienced pilots while posing greater challenge to advanced pilots. According to Pilatus, upon product launch, the PC-21 possessed \\"superior aerodynamic performance when compared with any other turboprop trainer on the market\\". The aircraft features a tandem-seating arrangement (student in-front/instructor behind) in a bird strike-resistant glass canopy with allround vision. The cabin, which is pressurized, is equipped with an On-Board Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS), air conditioning, and Martin-Baker CH16C Zero-Zero ejection seats.\\"PC-21: 21st Century Training for 21st Century Air Forces.\\" Pilatus Aircraft, Retrieved: 23 March 2016. The flight controls, which are fully balanced and harmonized, are optimized for ease of operation and overall effectiveness. An anti-g system is also present in order to minimize the effects of high g-forces experienced during tactical training and aerobatic maneuvers. Pilots are able to spend a greater amount of time concentrating on the aircraft's external situation and upon mission data inputs due to an ergonomic design approach, ease-of-use controls, and clear visual/system data displays. In addition, a full autopilot and civil flight management system are also present. The PC-21 is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-68B turboprop engine of 1,600 shaft horse power, which drives a five-bladed graphite scimitar propeller manufactured by Hartzell; it has been claimed by Pilatus that the PC-21 possesses speed and climb rates previously normally performed only by jet-powered aircraft. It is also fitted with a high-speed profile wing, rated for maneuvers up to 8g, complete with hydraulically-assisted ailerons and spoilers which enable the execution of fighter-like rates of roll and other maneuvers. In order to make the aircraft easy to fly at low speeds, crucial to the advanced trainer role, the PC-21 is furnished with a digital power management system and the rudder control system is equipped with an automatic yaw compensator/suppression system to compensate for airspeed and engine power changes.\\"Aircraft Data.\\" Pilatus Aircraft, Retrieved: 22 March 2016. Underside of a PC-21 in-flight A key feature of the PC-21 is the embedded simulation and training suite, which provides cross- platform cockpit emulation, weapons simulation, stores management system, simulated radar and electronic warfare, a tactical situation display, and data link functionality.Penny, Stewart. \\"Pilatus unveils simulation system for PC-21 trainer.\\" Flight International, 3 June 2003. Key to this is the Mission Support System (MSS), which comprises the Mission Planning System (MPS) and Mission Debriefing System (MBS); data can be loaded and unloaded from these, which is compatible with ground-based stations for pre-flight configuration or post-mission analysis. The integrated mission computer is of an open architecture, allowing for third-party modifications and upgrades to take place; software can also be customized to conform to customer preferences.Hoyle, Craig. \\"Pilatus to adapt PC-21.\\" Flight International, 14 November 2006. Critical and non-critical software are also deliberately separated. The cockpit of the PC-21 features a high level of systems integration and conforms to modern avionics standards. The systems of the forward and rear cockpits can be 'de-coupled' between the student and instructor; the instructor may exercise real-time manipulation of the student's displays, sensor performance, and system modes such as to create synthetic air-to-air radar targets, artificial non-safety critical system failures, and controlled data degradation. The aircraft's fully digital glass cockpit features three large colour liquid crystal displays (LCD), one performing as the primary flight display (PFD) and two multi-function displays (MFDs) for system/mission management, in addition to CMC Electronics-provided head-up displays (HUD) for both the pilot and instructor.\\"Integrated cockpit is pillar of new product strategy.\\" Flight International, 15 June 2005. The trim gauge is the only analogue dial in the cockpit. For control simplicity, a Hands on Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) control philosophy has been followed. Both the display and control systems present also resemble their counterparts used upon modern front-line combat aircraft for greater realism during training; and can be further customized in order to be more representative of specific combat aircraft.\\"A Cockpit for Maximum Training Value.\\" Pilatus Aircraft, Retrieved: 22 March 2016.

Auguste Dupin is a fictional character created by Edgar Allan Poe. Dupin made his first appearance in Poe's 1841 short story \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\", widely considered the first detective fiction story. He reappears in \\"The Mystery of Marie Rog√™t\\" (1842) and \\"The Purloined Letter\\" (1844). Dupin is not a professional detective and his motivations for solving the mysteries change throughout the three stories. Using what Poe termed \\"ratiocination\\", Dupin combines his considerable intellect with creative imagination, even putting himself in the mind of the criminal. His talents are strong enough that he appears able to read the mind of his companion, the unnamed narrator of all three stories. Poe created the Dupin character before the word detective had been coined. The character laid the groundwork for fictional detectives to come, including Sherlock Holmes, and established most of the common elements of the detective fiction genre. Character background and analysis Facsimile of Poe's original manuscript for \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\", the first appearance of C. Auguste Dupin Dupin is from what was once a wealthy family, but \\"by a variety of untoward events\\" has been reduced to more humble circumstances, and contents himself only with the basic necessities of life. He now lives in Paris with his close friend, the anonymous narrator of the stories. The two met by accident while both were searching for \\"the same rare and very remarkable volume\\" in an obscure library. This scene, the two characters searching for a hidden text, serves as a metaphor for detection. They promptly move to an old manor located in Faubourg Saint-Germain. For hobbies, Dupin is \\"fond\\" of enigmas, conundrums, and hieroglyphics. He bears the title Chevalier, meaning that he is a knight in the L√©gion d'honneur. Dupin shares some features with the later gentleman detective, a character type that became common in the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. He is acquainted with police prefect \\"G.\\", who appears in all three stories seeking his counsel. In \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\", Dupin investigates the murder of a mother and daughter in Paris. He investigates another murder in \\"The Mystery of Marie Rog√™t\\". This story was based on the true story of Mary Rogers, a saleswoman at a cigar store in Manhattan whose body was found floating in the Hudson River in 1841. Dupin's final appearance, in \\"The Purloined Letter\\", features an investigation of a letter stolen from the French queen. Poe called this story \\"perhaps, the best of my tales of ratiocination\\". Throughout the three stories, Dupin travels through three distinct settings. In \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\", he travels through city streets; in \\"The Mystery of Marie Rog√™t\\", he is in the wide outdoors; in \\"The Purloined Letter\\", he is in an enclosed private space. Dupin is not actually a professional detective, and his motivations change through his appearances. In \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\", he investigates the murders for his personal amusement, and to prove the innocence of a falsely accused man. He refuses a financial reward. However, in \\"The Purloined Letter\\", Dupin purposefully pursues a financial reward. Dupin's method While discussing Dupin's method in the light of Charles Sanders Peirce's logic of making good guesses or abductive reasoning, Nancy Harrowitz first quotes Poe's definition of analysis and then shows how \\"Poe the semiotician is running the gamut of possibilities here‚Äîinferences, reasoning backwards, visual, sensual and aural signs, reading faces. Playing cards with the man would have been an interesting experience.\\" There is considerable controversy about the philosophical nature of Dupin's method. According to biographer Joseph Krutch, Dupin is portrayed as a dehumanized thinking machine, a man whose sole interest is in pure logic. However, Krutch has been accused elsewhere of a \\"lazy reading\\" of Poe.Pearl, Matthew, introduction to Poe's Murders in the Rue Morgue, Random House, 2009 According to Krutch, Dupin's deductive prowess is first exhibited when he appears to read the narrator's mind by rationally tracing his train of thought for the previous fifteen minutes. He employs what he terms \\"ratiocination\\". Dupin's method is to identify with the criminal and put himself in his mind. By knowing everything that the criminal knows, he can solve any crime. His attitude towards life seems to portray him as a snob who feels that due to his aptitude normal human interaction and relationships are beneath him. In this method, he combines his scientific logic with artistic imagination. As an observer, he pays special attention to what is unintended, such as hesitation, eagerness or a casual or inadvertent word. Dupin's method also emphasizes the importance of reading and writing: many of his clues come from newspapers or written reports from the Prefect. This device also engages the readers, who follow along by reading the clues themselves. Inspiration Poe may have gotten the last name \\"Dupin\\" from a character in a series of stories first published Burton's Gentleman's Magazine in 1828 called \\"Unpublished passages in the Life of Vidocq, the French Minister of Police\\". The name also implies \\"duping\\" or deception, a skill Dupin shows off in \\"The Purloined Letter.\\" Detective fiction, however, had no real precedent and the word detective had not yet been coined when Poe first introduced Dupin. The closest example in fiction is Voltaire's Zadig (1748), in which the main character performs similar feats of analysis, themselves borrowed from The Three Princes of Serendip, an Italian rendition of a famous poem called Hasht Bihisht written by the Indian poet Amir Khusrau, which itlsef is based on the Haft Paykar by Nizami, written around 1197 AD, which in turn takes its outline from the earlier epic Shahnameh written by the Persian poet Firdausi around 1010 AD. In writing the series of Dupin tales, Poe capitalized on contemporary popular interest. His use of an orangutan in \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" was inspired by the popular reaction to an orangutan that had been on display at the Masonic Hall in Philadelphia in July 1839. In \\"The Mystery of Mary Rog√™t\\", he used a true story that had become of national interest. Literary influence and significance Sherlock Holmes was one of several fictional detectives influenced by Dupin. C. Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the first detective in fiction. The character served as the prototype for many that were created later, including Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle and Hercule Poirot by Agatha Christie. Conan Doyle once wrote, \\"Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\\" Many tropes that would later become commonplace in detective fiction first appeared in Poe's stories: the eccentric but brilliant detective, the bumbling constabulary, the first-person narration by a close personal friend. Dupin also initiates the storytelling device where the detective announces his solution and then explains the reasoning leading up to it. Like Sherlock Holmes, Dupin uses his considerable deductive prowess and observation to solve crimes. Poe also portrays the police in an unsympathetic manner as a sort of foil to the detective. The character helped established the genre of detective fiction, distinct from mystery fiction, with an emphasis on the analysis and not trial-and-error. Brander Matthews wrote: \\"The true detective story as Poe conceived it is not in the mystery itself, but rather in the successive steps whereby the analytic observer is enabled to solve the problem that might be dismissed as beyond human elucidation.\\" In fact, in the three stories which star Dupin, Poe created three types of detective fiction which established a model for all future stories: the physical type (\\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\"), the mental (\\"The Mystery of Marie Rog√™t\\"), and a balanced version of both (\\"The Purloined Letter\\"). Fyodor Dostoevsky called Poe \\"an enormously talented writer\\" and favorably reviewed Poe's detective stories. The character Porfiry Petrovich in Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment was influenced by Dupin. Other writers A Study in Scarlet (1887) * In the first Sherlock Holmes story, A Study in Scarlet (1887), Doctor Watson compares Holmes to Dupin, to which Holmes replies: \\"No doubt you think you are complimenting me ... In my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow... He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appears to imagine\\". Alluding to an episode in \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\", where Dupin deduces what his friend is thinking despite their having walked together in silence for a quarter of an hour, Holmes remarks: \\"That trick of his breaking in on his friend's thoughts with an apropos remark... is really very showy and superficial\\"; nevertheless, Holmes later performs the same 'trick' on Watson in \\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\\". * Louisa May Alcott parodied Dupin and Poe in her 1865 thriller \\"V.V., or Plots and Counterplots\\", which has been credited by literary critic Catherine Ross Nickerson as the second-oldest work of modern detective fiction after only Poe's Dupin stories themselves. A short story published anonymously by Alcott, the story concerns a Scottish aristocrat who tries to prove that a mysterious woman has killed his fianc√©e and cousin. The detective on the case, Antoine Dupres, is a parody of Auguste Dupin who is less concerned with solving the crime as he is in setting up a way to reveal the solution with a dramatic flourish. * In Murder in the Madhouse (1935), the first of Jonathan Latimer's series of screwball crime novels starring detective William Crane, Crane presents himself in the sanitarium as C. Auguste Dupin. The story contains more oblique references in the form of stylistic elements (offstage murders, Crane's theories of deduction) that suggest Poe had an influence on Latimer's writing. * Jorge Luis Borges pays homage to Poe's Dupin in \\"Death and the Compass\\", by calling his main detective character Erik L√∂nrott an \\"Auguste Dupin\\"-type detective. This is one of the stories published by Borges in his Ficciones (1944). Borges also translated Poe's works into Spanish. * Dupin had considerable impact on the Agatha Christie character Hercule Poirot, first introduced in The Mysterious Affair at Styles (1920). Later in the fictional detective's life, he writes a book on Edgar Allan Poe in the novel Third Girl (1966). * Dupin next appears in a series of seven short stories in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine by Michael Harrison in the 1960s. The stories were collected by the Publishers Mycroft & Moran in 1968 as The Exploits of Chevalier Dupin. The stories include \\"The Vanished Treasure\\" (May 1965) and \\"The Fires in the Rue St. Honor√©\\" (January 1967). This collection was subsequently published in England by Tom Stacey in 1972 as Murder in the Rue Royale and Further Exploits of the Chevalier Dupin and included a further five stories written since the original publication. * In The Work of Betrayal (1975) by Mario Brelich ‚Äì Dupin investigates the mysterious case of Judas Iscariot. * The Man Who Was Poe, (1991) a juvenile novel by Avi, features Dupin befriending a young boy named Edmund. The two solve mysteries together in Providence, Rhode Island. Dupin is revealed to be Edgar Allan Poe himself. * Novelist George Egon Hatvary uses Dupin in his novel The Murder of Edgar Allan Poe (1997) as detective and narrator. Dupin travels to America to investigate the circumstances of Poe's mysterious death in 1849. In the novel, Dupin and Poe became friends when Poe stayed in Paris in 1829, and it was Poe who assisted Dupin in the three cases about which Poe wrote. Hatvary writes that Dupin resembles Poe, so much so that several people confuse the two on first sight. * Dupin makes a guest appearance in the first two issues of Alan Moore's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume I (1999) graphic novel series, helping to track down and subdue the monstrous, Hulk-like Mr. Hyde (who is living secretly in Paris after faking the death described in The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and is the actual murderer from Dupin's first short story). He informs the protagonists (Mina Murray from Dracula, Allan Quatermain from King Solomon's Mines and Captain Nemo from Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea) that the murders in the Rue Morgue have started to happen again, one of the first victims being Anna \\"Nana\\" Coupeau. * The Black Throne (2002) by Roger Zelazny & Fred Saberhagen ‚Äì is a novel about Poe which has an appearance by Dupin. * Dupin is the hero of Les ogres de Montfaucon by G√©rard D√¥le (2004), a collection of thirteen detective stories set in the 19th century, the last of which (¬´ Le drame de Reichenbach ¬ª) also provides a link with Sherlock Holmes. * Dupin teams up with the Count of Monte-Cristo to fight Les Habits Noirs in the story The Kind-Hearted Torturer by John Peel published in the anthology Tales of the Shadowmen, Volume 1 (2005). * The search for the \\"real Dupin\\" is at the center of Matthew Pearl's novel The Poe Shadow (2006). * Dupin makes an appearance, alongside Poe himself, in the novel Edgar Allan Poe on Mars (2007) by Jean-Marc Lofficier & Randy Lofficier. * In The Paralogs of Phileas Fogg (2016), author James Downard has Dupin help Fogg and his cohorts resolve some issues during the American leg of their around-the-world adventure. * C. Auguste Dupin and Edgar Allan Poe are a sleuthing duo in Karen Lee Street's gothic mystery trilogy: Edgar Allan Poe and the London Monster (2016); Edgar Allan Poe and the Jewel of Peru (2018); and Edgar Allan Poe and the Empire of the Dead (2020). In other media Dupin, as he appeared in volume 10 of Detective Conan A Pierre Dupin appears in Universal Pictures' 1932 horror-mystery film Murders in the Rue Morgue. The Mystery of Marie Roget was also filmed in 1942. Dupin (played by Joseph Cotten) is a character in the 1951 Fletcher Markle film The Man with a Cloak. Dupin's true identity is revealed at the end of the film to be Poe himself. In the comic series Batman Confidential, the creation of Batman's crime-solving super-computer which is linked to Interpol, FBI, and CIA databases is introduced. Commonly known as the \\"Bat Computer,\\" it is originally nicknamed \\"Dupin,\\" after Batman's \\"hero.\\" Dupin was highlighted in volume 10 of the Detective Conan manga's edition of \\"Gosho Aoyama's Mystery Library\\", a section of the graphic novels where the author introduces a different detective (or occasionally, a villain) from mystery literature, television, or other media. C. Auguste Dupin is the protagonist, and the player's partner, in the \\"Dark Tales\\" Hidden Objects series, developed by ERS Game Studios, published by Big Fish Games. This game is based on Poe's horror works where the Dupin and the player solve various mysteries. In The Vile Village, Count Olaf disguises himself as \\"Detective Dupin\\" in order to falsely accuse the protagonists of murder. In the comic series The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Dupin appears as a minor character; we first meet him shortly after Mina Murray and Allan Quatermain arrive in Paris, France in late June 1898.

A wire transfer can be made from one bank account to another bank account, or through a transfer of cash at a cash office. Different wire transfer systems and operators provide a variety of options relative to the immediacy and finality of settlement and the cost, value, and volume of transactions. Central bank wire transfer systems, such as the Federal Reserves Fedwire system in the United States, are more likely to be real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems, as they provide the quickest availability of funds. This is because they post the gross (complete) entry against electronic accounts of the wire transfer system operator. Other systems, such as the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), provide net settlement on a periodic basis. More immediate settlement systems tend to process higher monetary value time-critical transactions, have higher transaction costs, and have a smaller volume of payments. A faster settlement process allows less time for currency fluctuations while money is in transit.  History  The first widely used service for wire transfers was launched by Western Union in 1872 on its existing telegraph network. Once a sender had paid money to one telegraph office, the operator could transmit a message and \\"wire\\" the money to another office, using passwords and code books to authorize the release of the funds to a recipient at that location. By 1877 the service was used to transfer almost $2.5 million each year. Because the earliest wire transfers were using telegraph networks, it was termed telegraphic transfer and this name is still used in some countries.  Process  A bank wire transfer is effected as follows: # The entity wishing to do a transfer approaches a bank and gives the bank the order to transfer a certain amount of money. IBAN and BIC codes are given as well so the bank knows where the money needs to be sent. # The sending bank transmits a message, via a secure system (such as SWIFT or Fedwire), to the receiving bank, requesting that it effect payment according to the instructions given. # The message also includes settlement instructions. The actual transfer is not instantaneous: funds may take several hours or even days to move from the sender's account to the receiver's account. # Either the banks involved must hold a reciprocal account with each other, or the payment must be sent to a bank with such an account, a correspondent bank, for further benefit to the ultimate recipient. Banks collect payment for the service from the sender as well as from the recipient. The sending bank typically collects a fee separate from the funds being transferred, while the receiving bank and intermediary banks through which the transfer travels deduct fees from the money being transferred so that the recipient receives less than what the sender sent.  Regulation and price  Since 2009 the European Union Regulation No 924/2009 Regulation (EC) No 924/2009. controls cross-border payments in the European Union. In the new regulation Article 1 (q.v., Ref.4) states that an IBAN/BIC transfer within Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) must not cost more than a national transfer, no matter which currency is used. The receiving bank can charge for exchanging to local currency. Prior to this, in 2002 the European Union relegated the regulation of fees a bank may charge for payments in euro between EU member states down to the domestic level,Regulation (EC) No. 2560/2001. European Parliament and the Council of the European Union resulting in very low or no fees for electronic transfers within the Eurozone. In 2005, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway joined the EU regulation on electronic transfers. However, this regulation was superseded by the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), consisting of 32 European countries. In the United States, domestic wire transfers are governed by Federal Regulation JRegulation J - Check Collection and Funds Transfer. BankersOnline.com and by Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code.Section 4A of Universal Commercial Code. Legal Information Institute. US wire transfers can be costly. In 2016, among the 15 largest retail banks, the average fee for an outgoing domestic wire was $25. Incoming domestic wire fees were about evenly split between $0 (free) and $15. In Australia, money transfers are primarily regulated by ASIC, there is sometimes further regulation by AUSTRAC in industries where money laundering or terrorism financing are a risk; such as money remittance services. Domestic transfers in Australia are generally free to consumers. International transfers can be costly, and banks will often charge a fee between $0 (free) and $20, and an FX margin (the difference between the interbank rate, and the rate that you are charged). Cheaper alternatives to the banks are available from foreign exchange brokers, who usually charge a lower fee and/or margin.  Security  With bank-to-bank wire transfer, each account holder must have a proven identity. Chargebacks are unlikely, although wires can be recalled. Information contained in wires are transmitted securely through encrypted communications methods. The price of bank wire transfers varies greatly, depending on the bank and its location; in some countries, the fee associated with the service can be costly. Wire transfers done through cash offices are essentially anonymous and are designed for transfer between persons who trust each other. It is unsafe to send money by wire to an unknown person to collect at a cash office; the receiver of the money may, after collecting it, not provide whatever goods or services they promised in return for the payment, but instead simply disappear. This scam has been used often, especially in the so-called 419 scams which often nominate Western Union for collection. International transfers involving the United States are subject to monitoring by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which monitors information provided in the text of the wire and then decides whether, according to the US Government's federal regulations and political positions, money is being transferred to terrorist groups, or countries or entities under sanction by the United States government. If a financial institution suspects that funds are being sent from or to one of these entities, it must block the transfer and freeze the funds.OFAC facts SWIFT or IBAN wire transfers are not completely free of vulnerabilities. Every intermediary bank that handles a wire transaction can take a fee directly out of the wire payload (the assets being transferred) without the account holder's knowledge or consent. In many places, there is no legislation or technical means to protect customers from this practice. If bank S is the sending bank (or brokerage), and bank R is the receiving bank (or brokerage), and banks I1, I2 and I3 are intermediary banks, the client may only have a contract with bank S and/or R, but banks I1, I2 and I3 can (and often do) take money from the wire without any direct arrangement with the client. Clients are sometimes taken by surprise when less money arrives at bank R. Contrast this with cheques, where the amount transferred is guaranteed in full, and fees (if there are any) can be charged only at endpoint banks. The European Union offers some partial protection from this practice by prohibiting European intermediary banks from taking a fee out of the amount being transferred, even for transatlantic transfers. However, it's still common practice for a European brokerage firm to state that they charge no transfer fee, and then contact their bank to take an unpublished fee from the amount transferred as a means to compensate their bank with their clients' assets--e.g., CMC Markets implements this policy in partnership with NatWest.  Methods  = Retail money transfers = One of the largest companies that offer wire transfer is Western Union, which allows individuals to transfer or receive money without an account with Western Union or any financial institution. Concern and controversy about Western Union transfers have increased in recent years, because of the increased monitoring of money- laundering transactions, as well as concern about terrorist groups using the service, particularly in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Although Western Union keeps information about senders and receivers, some transactions can be done essentially anonymously, for the receiver is not always required to show identification.Can Western Union Keep On Delivering?. Business Week There are other companies in this market, like Unity Monetary Services B.V., RIA Financial Services, MoneyGram and VFX Financial PLC and LCC Money Transfer (both based in Europe) as well as Azimo, Dwolla, TransferGo, TransferWise, and WeWire App. Another option for consumers and businesses transferring money internationally is to use specialised brokerage houses for their international money transfer needs. Many of these specialised brokerage houses can transfer money at better exchange rates compared to banks, thus saving up to 4%. These providers can offer a range of currency exchange products like Spot Contracts, Forward Contracts and Limit Orders. However, not all such providers are regulated by appropriate government bodies. For example, in the UK, even though such companies are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, not all of them fall under (FCA) scrutiny. Regulators include the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the Financial Transactions Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) in Canada, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department in China and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK. = International = Most international transfers are executed through SWIFT, a co-operative society founded in 1974 by seven international banks, which operate a global network to facilitate the transfer of financial messages. Using these messages, banks can exchange data for the transfer of funds between financial institutions. SWIFT's headquarters are in La Hulpe, on the outskirts of Brussels, Belgium. SWIFT also acts as a United Nations‚Äìsanctioned international standards body for the creation and maintenance of financial-messaging standards. See SWIFT Standards. Each financial institution is assigned an ISO 9362 code, also called a Bank Identifier Code (BIC) or SWIFT Code. These codes are generally eight characters long. For example: Deutsche Bank is an international bank with its head office in Frankfurt, Germany, the SWIFT Code for which is DEUTDEFF: * DEUT identifies Deutsche Bank. * DE is the country code for Germany. * FF is the code for Frankfurt. Using an extended code of 11 digits (if the receiving bank has assigned extended codes to branches or to processing areas) allows the payment to be directed to a specific office. For example: DEUTDEFF500 would direct the payment to an office of Deutsche Bank in Bad Homburg. SWIFT deviates slightly from the standard, though, by using position nine for a Logical Terminal ID, making its extended codes 12 digits long. European banks making transfers within the European Union and within Switzerland also use the International Bank Account Number, or IBAN.  International prepaid cards  International prepaid cards are an alternative way for transferring funds. Companies can provide a debit card for worldwide employees' payments. The recipients don‚Äôt need to have a bank account and can use the card in places that a debit card is accepted at point-of-sale or online and may withdraw funds in local currency at an ATM. = United States of America = Banks in the United States use SWIFT to send messages to notify banks in other countries that a payment has been made. Banks use the CHIPS or Fedwire system to actually effect the payment. Domestic bank-to-bank transfers are conducted through the Fedwire system, which uses the Federal Reserve System and its assignment of ABA routing transit number, which uniquely identify each bank.  Other electronic transfers  Other forms of electronic transfers include, for example, electronic funds transfer system (EFTS). This is the system used to transfer money from a bank account to another party. It is also the system used in some payments made via a bank's online bill payment service. These transfers are made using a bank routing number and the account number at that institution. EFTS transfers differ from wire transfers in important legal ways. An EFTS payment is essentially an electronic personal check, whereas a wire transfer is more like an electronic cashier's check. EFTS transfers are often called \\"ACH transfers\\", because they take place through Automated Clearing Houses. One important way ACH transfers differ from wire transfer is that the recipient can initiate it. There are of course restrictions, but this is the way people often set up automatic bill payment with utility companies, for example.

Entertaining the troops during World War I immortalized her as \\"the sweetheart of the AEF\\" (American Expeditionary Force). Biography =Early life= Elsie Bierbower was born in Marion, Ohio, the daughter of Josephine Janis (1861-1930) and John Eleazer Bierbower (1858-1929). She had a brother, Percy John (1885-1907). Stage Bierbower first took to the stage at age 2. By age 11, she was a headliner on the vaudeville circuit, performing under the name Little Elsie. As she matured, using the stage name Elsie Janis, she began perfecting her comedic skills. Acclaimed by American and British critics, Janis was a headliner on Broadway and London. On Broadway, she starred in a number of successful shows, including The Vanderbilt Cup (1906), The Hoyden (1907), The Slim Princess (1911), and The Century Girl (1916). Elsie performed at the grand opening of the Brown Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky on October 5, 1925. Film, screenwriting and music Janis also enjoyed a career as a Hollywood actress, screenwriter, production manager and composer. She was co-credited alongside Gene Markey for writing the original story for Close Harmony (1929) and as composer and production manager for Paramount on Parade (1930). She and director Edmund Goulding wrote the song \\"Love, Your Magic Spell Is Everywhere\\" for Gloria Swanson for her talkie debut film The Trespasser (1929). Janis's song \\"Oh, Give Me Time for Tenderness\\" was featured in the Bette Davis movie Dark Victory (1939), also directed by Goulding. Radio announcer In 1934, Janis became the first female announcer on the NBC radio network. World War I Elsie Janis, 17 years old, in The Vanderbilt Cup 1906. She's dressed in early automobile attire. In the play, she drives a car on stageGreat Stars of the American Stage by Daniel Blum c. 1952 Profile #69 (has full length version of 1906 photo) Janis was a tireless advocate for British and American soldiers fighting in World War I. She raised funds for Liberty Bonds. Accompanied by her mother, Janis also took her act on the road, entertaining troops stationed near the front lines ‚Äì one of the first popular American artists to do so in a war fought on foreign soil. Ten days after the armistice, she recorded for HMV several numbers from her revue Hullo, America, including \\"Give Me the Moonlight, Give Me the Girl\\".Rust, Brian, introduction to facsimile reprint of HMV catalogues 1914-18, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, She wrote about her wartime experiences in The Big Show: My Six Months with the American Expeditionary Forces (published in 1919), and recreated these in Behind the Lines, a 1926 Vitaphone musical short. A new musical about this period of her life called Elsie Janis and the Boys, written by Carol J. Crittenden and composer John T. Prestianni, premiered under the direction of Charles A. Wallace as part of the Rotunda Theatre Series in the Wortley-Peabody Theater in Dallas, Texas on August 15, 2014. Children Janis expressed no desire to have children of her own, saying she'd never meet the standards her mother set, and said that her young husband could be her child. She was foster mother to a 14-year-old Italian war veteran and orphan, Michael Cardi. Later life Janis maintained her private home ElJan on the east side of High Street in Columbus, Ohio. The home was across the street from what was Ohio State University's Ohio Field, the precursor to Ohio Stadium. Janis sold the house following her mother's death. In 1932, Janis married Gilbert Wilson, who was 16 years her junior, which caused some scandal. There is some evidence it might have been a bearded relationship. The couple lived in the Phillipse Manor section of Sleepy Hollow, New York, formerly named North Tarrytown, until Janis moved to the Los Angeles area of California where she lived until her death. Her final film was the 1940 Women in War. Elsie Janis died in 1956 at her home in Beverly Hills, California, aged 66, and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

A total of 2,008 athletes representing 22 nations participated in 110 events in 18 sports. Diving, field hockey, and figure skating were contested for the first time at these Games. Argentina, Switzerland and Turkey were the only nations that did not earn any medals.

Particular success was achieved by the British team in the boxing events, where out of a possible fifteen medals across the five weight classes, they won all but the middleweight silver medal, which was taken by Reginald Baker competing for Australasia. The United States finished second in the medal standings, fielding only 112 athletes compared to 676 that were entered by Britain. Australasia was the name given to the combined team of athletes from Australia (making its fourth Olympic appearance) and New Zealand (competing for the first time).

Early life and education He was born in Odense, Denmark, attended Odense Theatrical School in 1958, and graduated from the Royal Danish Theatre's Theatrical School in 1962. Beginning in 1971, he was the manager of several theatres in Copenhagen. Career Grunwald made his debut in En blandt mange (\\"One among many\\") in 1961. He played one of the lead roles in the popular series of Olsen Gang movies, starring as Benny Frandsen, alongside Ove Sprog√∏e's Egon Olsen and Poul Bundgaard's Kjeld Jensen. Grunwald founded and led Bristol Teatret in Copenhagen from 1971 to 1980. In 1979, Grunwald succeeded Bent Meiding as manager of the Betty Nansen Theatre, a post he held until 1992. From 1977, together with Peder Sadolin, his partner from Bristol Teatret, he was also a driving force behind the establishment of √òstre Gasv√¶rk Teater in an abandoned gasometer. Grunwald retired on 11 June 2017, stating his body was too old. Death On 16 October 2018 the 83-year-old Grunwald informed Danish media that he had developed thyroid cancer, and that he only had months left to live.

Safe deposit vault after the 2011 Joplin tornado. A safe deposit box, also known as a safety deposit box, is an individually secured container, usually held within a larger safe or bank vault. Safe deposit boxes are generally located in banks, post offices or other institutions. Safe deposit boxes are used to store valuable possessions, such as gemstones, precious metals, currency, marketable securities, luxury goods, important documents (e.g. wills, property deeds, or birth certificates), or computer data, which need protection from theft, fire, flood, tampering, or other perils. In the United States, neither banks nor the FDIC insure the contents. An individual can purchase separate insurance for the safe deposit box in order to cover e.g. theft, fire, flooding or terrorist attacks. Hotels, resorts, and cruise ships sometimes also offer safe deposit boxes or small safes to their patrons, for temporary use during their stay.Payne, Kirby D. Safety Deposit Boxes and In-Room Safes. Hotel Online data base of News and Trends. These facilities may be located behind the reception desk, or securely anchored within private guest rooms for privacy. The contents of safe deposit boxes may be seized under the legal theory of abandoned property. They also may be searched and seized by the order of a court through the issuance of search warrant. In the United States and elsewhere, safe deposit boxes are considered a \\"legacy service\\"; many new bank branches do not bother to install any.Safe Deposit Boxes Aren't Safe In the 20th century, bank branches were more prestigious; in the 21st century, space has grown more valuable with higher land values and rents, and many banks see the service as ancillary to their core business. Additionally, despite the public perception of safe deposit boxes as being extremely secure, there is little incentive for banks to actually ensure this is true; there are no federal laws in the US governing the matter or rules that would require compensation to customers if property stored there is stolen or destroyed.

The paper is owned by the Gannett Newspaper organization, the paper is also notable as having once been owned and published by Warren G. Harding (prior to his election as President of the United States), and his wife Florence Kling Harding. History Founded as the Daily Pebble, the format of the small daily grew and became The Marion Daily Star. When Harding acquired the newspaper in the 1880s, it was struggling. The dubious financial position of The Marion Daily Star improved following the marriage of Harding to Florence Kling DeWolfe who promptly set about to straighten out the accounting, and increasing circulation. American Civil Liberties Union founder and Socialist candidate for President Norman Thomas carried the Daily Star as a youngster growing up in Marion where his father was minister of the First Presbyterian Church. Under Harding the newspaper's editorial position leaned toward the Republican Party platform, but remained somewhat neutral because of its position of the daily newspaper of record for Marion County. However, Harding also launched The Marion Weekly Star ‚Äì a once-a-week summary newspaper designed for mail delivery and rural circulation; this paper was unapologetically Republican in its editorials. The Weekly Star was published from the 1890s into the 1910s when it was discontinued. The Hardings retained ownership in the paper until mid-1923 when they sold the business to Brush- Moore Newspapers. For a number of years, the paper was part of the Thompson Newspaper chain based in Canada, who acquired Brush-Moore Newspapers in 1967. Under their ownership, the name was briefly changed to The Star in an attempt to broaden the marketability of the paper beyond the Marion County region. Again known as The Marion Star, the paper is owned and operated by Gannett, who purchased the paper from Thomson in 2000. Under Gannett, editorial, business offices and retail advertising are maintained in Marion, while printing and classified advertising operations have been moved to a regional press house in Mansfield, Ohio. The Marion Ohio Public Library and The Ohio Historical Society maintain microfilm libraries of newspaper for public research; the paper is also accessible for a monthly subscription fee through www.ancestry.com and www.newspaperarchives.com.

The Bank of England in London The Reserve Bank of New Zealand in Wellington A lender of last resort (LOLR) is the institution in a financial system that acts as the provider of liquidity to a financial institution which finds itself unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in the interbank lending market and other facilities or sources have been exhausted. It is, in effect, a government guarantee of liquidity to financial institutions. Since the beginning of the 20th century, most central banks have been providers of lender of last resort facilities, and their functions usually also include ensuring liquidity in the financial market in general. The objective is to prevent economic disruption as a result of financial panics and bank runs spreading from one bank to the next from a lack of liquidity in one. Different definitions of the lender of last resort exist in literature. A comprehensive one is that it is \\"the discretionary provision of liquidity to a financial institution (or the market as a whole) by the central bank in reaction to an adverse shock which causes an abnormal increase in demand for liquidity which cannot be met from an alternative source\\". While the concept itself had been used previously, the term \\"lender of last resort\\" was supposedly first used in its current context by Sir Francis Baring, in his Observations on the Establishment of the Bank of England, which was published in 1797. Classical theory Although Alexander Hamilton, in 1792, was the first policymaker to explicate and implement a lender of last resort policy, the classical theory of the lender of last resort was mostly developed by two Englishmen in the 19th century: Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot. Although some of the details remain controversial, their general theory is still widely acknowledged in modern research and provides a suitable benchmark. Thornton and Bagehot were mostly concerned with the reduction of the money stock. That was because they feared that the deflationary tendency caused by a reduction of the money stock could reduce the level of economic activity. If prices did not adjust quickly, it would lead to unemployment and a reduction in output. By keeping the money stock constant, the purchasing power remains stable during shocks. When there is a shock induced panic, two things happen: # The depositors fear that they will not be able to convert their deposits into suitably safe liquid assets: in 19th-century Britain, that meant gold or Bank of England notes, the latter being a component of high-powered money. They increase the amount of cash they hold relative to deposits. # Banks, on the other hand, afraid of becoming illiquid, increase their reserves. Taken together, it reduces the money multiplier which, multiplied by the amount of base money, gives the money stock. This equation shows the relation: M = \\\\quad \\\\left \\\\lbrack \\\\frac{1+\\\\frac{C}{D}}{\\\\frac{C}{D} + \\\\frac{R}{D}} \\\\right \\\\rbrack B where M is the money stock, B is the money base, C/D is the ratio of cash to deposits held by the public, and R/D is the ratio of reserves to deposits held by the banks. If the multiplier is reduced from a shock and the amount of base money is constant, the money stock will decrease as a consequence. Thornton and Bagehot, therefore, suggested that the lender of last resort should increase the money base to offset the reduction of the multiplier. That was meant to keep the money stock constant and prevent an economic contraction. =Thornton's foundations= Thornton first published An Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain in 1802. His starting point was that only a central bank could perform the task of lender of last resort because it holds a monopoly in issuing bank notes. Unlike any other bank, the central bank has a responsibility towards the public to keep the money stock constant, thereby preventing negative externalities of monetary instability, such as unemployment, price instability, bank runs, and financial panic. =Bagehot's contribution= Bagehot was the second important contributor to the classical theory. In his book Lombard Street (1873), he mostly agreed with Thornton without ever mentioning him but also develops some new points and emphases. Bagehot advocates: \\"Very large loans at very high rates are the best remedy for the worst malady of the money market when a foreign drain is added to a domestic drain.\\" His main points can be summarized by his famous rule: lend \\"it most freely... to merchants, to minor bankers, to 'this and that man', whenever the security is good\\". =Summary of the classical theory= Thomas M. Humphrey, who has done extensive research on Thornton's and Bagehot's works, summarizes their main proposals as follows: (1) protect the money stock instead of saving individual institutions; (2) rescue solvent institutions only; (3) let insolvent institutions default; (4) charge penalty rates; (5) require good collateral; and (6) announce the conditions before a crisis so that the market knows exactly what to expect. Many of the points remain controversial today but it seems to be accepted that the Bank of England strictly followed these rules during the last third of the 19th century. Bank runs and contagion Most industrialized countries have had a lender of last resort for many years. Models explaining why propose that a bank run or bank panic can arise in any fractional reserve banking system and that the lender of last resort function is a way of preventing panics from happening. The Diamond and Dybvig model of bank runs has two Nash equilibria: one in which welfare is optimal and one where there is a bank run. The bank run equilibrium is an infamously self-fulfilling prophecy: if individuals expect a run to happen, it is rational for them to withdraw their deposits early: before they actually need it. That makes them lose some interest, but that is better than losing everything from a bank run. In the Diamond‚ÄìDybvig model, introducing a lender of last resort can prevent bank runs from happening so that only the optimal equilibrium remains. That is because individuals are no longer afraid of a liquidity shortage and so have no incentive to withdraw early. The lender of last resort will never come into action because the mere promise is enough to provide the confidence necessary to prevent a panic. Subsequently, the model has been extended to allow for financial contagion: the spreading of a panic from one bank to another, by Allen and Gale, and Freixas et al. respectively. Allen and Gale introduced an interbank market into the Diamond‚ÄìDybvig model to study contagion of bank panics from one region to another. An interbank market is created by banks because it insures them against a lack of liquidity at certain banks as long as the overall amount of liquidity is sufficient. Liquidity is allocated by the interbank market so that banks that have excess liquidity can provide this to banks that lack liquidity. As long as the total demand for liquidity does not exceed the supply, the interbank market will allocate liquidity efficiently and banks will be better off. However, if demand exceeds supply, it can have disastrous consequences. The interregional cross-holdings of deposits cannot increase the total amount of liquidity. Thus, long-term assets have to be liquidated, which causes loss. The degree of contagion depends on the interconnectedness of the banks in different regions. In an incomplete market (banks do not exchange deposits with all other banks), a high degree of interconnectedness causes contagion. Contagion is not caused if the market is either complete (banks have exchanged deposits with all other banks) or if the banks are little-connected. In Allen and Gale's model, the role of the central bank is to complete the markets to prevent contagion. Freixas et al.'s model is similar to the one by Allen and Gale, except that in Freixas et al.'s model, individuals face uncertainty about where they will need their money. There is a fraction of individuals (travelers) who need their money in a region other than home. Without a payment system, an individual has to withdraw his deposit early (when he finds out that he will need the money in a different place in the next period) and simply take the money along. That is inefficient because of the foregone interest payment. Banks therefore establish credit lines to allow individuals to withdraw their deposits in different regions. In the good equilibrium, welfare is increased just as in the Diamond‚ÄìDybvig model, but again there is a bank run equilibrium, too. It can arise if some individuals expect too many others to want to withdraw money in the same region in the next period. It is then rational to withdraw money early instead of not receiving any in the next period. It can happen even if all banks are solvent. Disputed matters There is no universal agreement on whether a nation's central bank or any agent of private banking interests should be its lender of last resort. Nor is there on the pros and cons of actions such a lender takes and their consequences. =Moral hazard= Moral hazard has been an explicit concern in the context of the lender of last resort since the days of Thornton. It is argued, for example, that the existence of a LOLR facility leads to excessive risk-taking by both bankers and investors, which would be dampened if illiquid banks were allowed to fail. Therefore, the LOLR can alleviate current panics in exchange for increasing the likelihood of future panics by risk-taking induced by moral hazard. That is exactly what the Report of the International Financial Institution Advisory Commission accuses the IMF of doing when it lends to emerging economies: \\"By preventing or reducing losses by international lenders, the IMF had implicitly signalled that, if local banks and other institutions incurred large foreign liabilities and government guaranteed private debts, the IMF would provide the foreign exchange needed to honour the guarantees.\\" Investors are protected against the downside of their investment and, at the same time, receive higher interest rates to compensate them for their risk. That encourages risk-taking and reduces the necessary diversification and led the Commission to conclude, \\"The importance of the moral hazard problem cannot be overstated.\\" However, not having a lender of last resort for fear of moral hazard may have worse consequences than moral hazard itself. Consequently, many countries have a central bank that acts as lender of last resort. These countries then try to prevent moral hazard by other means such as suggested by Stern: \\"official regulation; encouragement for private sector monitoring and self-regulation; and the imposition of costs on those who make mistakes, including enforcement of bankruptcy procedures when appropriate.\\" Some authors also suggest that moral hazard should not be a concern of the lender of last resort. The task of preventing it should be given to a supervisor or regulator that limits the amount of risk that can be taken. =Macro or micro responsibility= Whether or not the lender of last resort has a responsibility for saving individual banks has been a very controversial topic. Does the lender of last resort provide liquidity to the market as a whole (through open market operations) or should it (also) make loans to individual banks (through discount window lending)? There are two main views on this question, the money and the banking view: the money view, as argued, for example, by Goodfriend and King, and Capie, suggests, that the lender of last resort should provide liquidity to the market by open market operations only because it suffices to limit panics. What they call \\"banking policy\\" (discount window lending) may even be harmful because of moral hazard. The banking view finds that in reality the market does not allocate liquidity efficiently in times of crisis. Liquidity provided through open market operations is not efficiently distributed among banks in the interbank market, and there is a case for discount window lending. In a well-functioning interbank market only solvent banks can borrow. However, if the market is not functioning, even solvent banks may be unable to borrow, most likely because of asymmetric information. A model developed by Flannery suggests that the private market for interbank loans can fail if banks face uncertainty about the risk involved in lending to other banks. In times of crisis with less certainty, however, discount window loans are the least costly way of solving the problem of uncertainty. Rochet and Vives extend the traditional banking view to provide more evidence that interbank markets indeed do not function properly as Goodfriend and King had suggested. \\"The main contribution of our paper so far has been to show the theoretical possibility of a solvent bank being illiquid, due to a coordination failure on the interbank market.\\" Goodhart proposes that only discount window lending should be considered lending of last resort. The reason is that central banks' open market operations cannot be separated from regular open market operations. =Distinction between illiquid and insolvent= According to Bagehot and, following him, many later writers the lender of last resort should not lend to insolvent banks. That is reasonable in particular because it would encourage moral hazard. The distinction seems logical and is helpful in theoretical models, but some authors find that in reality it is difficult to apply. Especially in times of crisis the distinction is difficult to make. When an illiquid bank approaches the lender of last resort, there should always be a suspicion of insolvency. However, according to Goodhart, it is a myth that the central bank can evaluate that the suspicions are untrue under the usual constraints of time for arriving at a decision. Like Obstfeld he considers insolvency a possibility that arises with a certain amount of probability, not something that is certain. =Penalty rate and collateral requirement= Bagehot's reasoning behind charging penalty rates (i.e. higher rates than are available in the market) was as follows: (1) it would really make the lender of last resort the very last resort and (2) it would encourage the prompt repayment of the debt. Some authors suggest that charging a higher rate does not serve the purpose of the lender of last resort because a higher rate could make it too expensive for banks to borrow. Flannery and others mention that the Fed has neither asked for good collateral nor charged rates above the market, in recent years. =Announcement in advance= If the central bank announces in advance that it will act as lender of last resort in future crises, it can be understood as a credible promise and prevent bank panics. At the same time, it may increase moral hazard. While Bagehot emphasized that the benefit of the promise outweighs the costs, many central banks have intentionally not promised anything. =Private alternatives= Before the founding of the US Federal Reserve System as lender of last resort, its role had been assumed by private banks. Both the clearing-house system of New York and the Suffolk Bank of Boston had provided member banks with liquidity during crises. In the absence of a public solution a private alternative had developed. Advocates of the free banking view suggest that such examples show that there is no necessity for government intervention. The Suffolk Bank acted as lender of last resort during the Panic of 1837‚Äì39. Rolnick, Smith and Weber \\"argue that the Suffolk Bank's provision of note- clearing and lender of last resort services (via the Suffolk Banking System) lessened the effects of the Panic of 1837 in New England relative to the rest of the country, where no bank provided such services.\\" During the Panic of 1857, a policy committee of the New York Clearing House Association (NYCHA) allowed the issuance of the so-called clearing-house loan certificates. While their legality was controversial at the time, the idea of providing additional liquidity eventually led to a public provision of this service that was to be performed by the central bank, founded in 1913. Some authors view the establishment of clearing-houses as proof that the lender of last resort does not have to be provided by the central bank. Bordo agrees that it does not have to be a central bank. However, historical experience (mainly Canada and US) suggested to him that it has to be a public authority and not a private clearing-house association that provides the service. Historical experience Miron, Bordo, Wood and Goodhart show that the existence of central banks has reduced the frequency of bank runs. Miron uses data on the crises between 1890 and 1908 and compares it to the period of 1915 to 1933. That allows him to reject the hypothesis that after the new Federal Reserve acted as lender of last resort, the frequency of panics observed did not change. The conclusion of his discussion is that the \\"effects of monetary policy... that anticipated open market operations by the Fed probably had real effects.\\" Bordo analyses historical data by Schwartz and Kindleberger to determine whether a lender of last resort can prevent or reduce the effect of a panic or crisis. Bordo finds that Britain's last panic happened in 1866. Afterwards the Bank of England provided the necessary liquidity. According to Bordo, acting as a lender of last resort prevented panics in 1878, 1890, and 1914. Bordo concludes: \\"Successful lender of last resort actions prevented panics on numerous occasions. On those occasions when panics were not prevented, either the requisite institutions did not exist, or the authorities did not understand the proper actions to take. Most countries developed an effective LLR mechanism by the last one-third of the nineteenth century. The U.S. was the principal exception. Some public authority must provide the lender of last resort function.... Such an authority does not have to be a central bank. This is evident from the experience of Canada and other countries.\\" Wood compares the reaction of central banks to different crises in England, France, and Italy. When a lender of last resort existed, panics did not turn into crises. When the central bank failed to act, crises such as in France in 1848, however, happened. He concludes \\"that LOLR action contains a crisis, while absence of such action allows a localized panic to turn into a widespread banking crisis.\\" More recent examples are the crises in Argentina, Mexico and Southeastern Asia. There, central banks could not provide liquidity because banks had been borrowing in foreign currencies, which the central bank was unable to provide. =Bank of England= The Bank of England is often considered the model lender of last resort because it acted according to the classical rules of Thornton and Bagehot. \\"Banking scholars agree that the Bank of England in the last third of the nineteenth century was the lender of last resort par excellence. More than any central bank before or since, it adhered to the strict classical or Thornton-Bagehot version of the LLR concept.\\" =Federal Reserve System= The Federal Reserve System in the United States acts rather differently, and at least in some ways not in accordance with Bagehot's advice. Norbert J. Michel, a financial researcher, goes as far as saying that the Federal Reserve made the Great Depression worse by failing to fulfil its role of lender of last resort, a view shared amongst others by Milton Friedman.M King, The End of Alchemy (London 2017) p. 192 Critics like Michel nevertheless applaud the Fed‚Äôs role as LLR in the crisis of 1987, and in that following 9/11, Heritage report (though concerns about moral hazard resulting were certainly expressed at the time).W Cohan, Money and Power (Penguin 2012) p. 307 However, the Fed‚Äôs role in the Credit crunch of 2008 continues to polarise opinion.A Tooze, Crashed (Penguin 2019) p. 610 The classical economist Thomas M. Humphrey has identified several ways in which the modern Fed deviates from the traditional rules: (1) \\"Emphasis on Credit (Loans) as Opposed to Money,\\" (2) \\"Taking Junk Collateral,\\" (3) \\"Charging Subsidy Rates,\\" (4) \\"Rescuing Insolvent Firms Too Big and Interconnected to Fail,\\" (5) \\"Extension of Loan Repayment Deadlines,\\" (6) \\"No Pre-announced Commitment.\\" Indeed, some say its lender of last resort policies have jeopardized its operational independence, and have put taxpayers at risk. Mervyn King however has pointed out that 21st C banking (and hence the Fed as well) operate in a very different world from that of Bagehot, creating new problems for the LLR role Bagehot envisaged, highlighting especially the danger that haircuts on collateral, punitive rates, and the stigma of the deposit window can precipitate a bank run, or exacerbate a credit crunch:M King, The End of Alchemy (London 2017) p. 202-7 ‚ÄúIn extreme cases, the LOLR is the Judas kiss for banks forced to turn to the central bank for support‚Äù.M King, The End of Alchemy (London 2017) p. 205 As a result, other strategies were called for, and were indeed pursued by the Fed. The historian Adam Tooze has stressed how the Fed‚Äôs new liquidity facilities mapped onto the various elements of the eviscerated shadow banking system, thereby replacing a systemic failure of credit as LLR,A Tooze, Crashed' (Penguin 2019) p.206-7 (a role morphing perhaps into that of a dealer of last resort).Perry Mehrling, The New Lombard Street (2010) p. 107 Tooze concluded that ‚ÄúIn its own terms, as a capitalist stabilization effort...the Fed was remarkably successful‚Äù.A Tooze, Crashed (Penguin 2019) p. 610 =ECB= The European Central Bank arguably set itself up (controversially) as a conditional LOLR with its 2012 policy of Outright Monetary Transactions.A Tooze, 'Crashed (Penguin 2019) p. 441 =Prussia/Imperial Germany= In 1763, the king was the lender of last resort in Prussia; and in the 19th C., various official bodies, from the Prussian lottery to the Hamburg City Government, worked in consortia as LOLR. After unification, the financial crisis of 1873 forced the formation of the German Reichsbank (1876) to fulfil that role.M King, The End of Alchemy (Abacus 2017) p. 161 International lender of last resort =Theory= The matter of whether there is a need for an international lender of last resort is more controversial than for a domestic lender of last resort. Most authors agree that there is a need for a national lender of last resort and argue only about the specific set-up. There is, however, no agreement on the international level. There are mainly two opposing groups: one (Capie and Schwartz) says that an international lender of last resort (ILOLR) is technically impossible, while the other (Fischer, Obstfeld, Goodhardt and Huang) wants a modified International Monetary Fund (IMF) to assume this role. Fischer argues that financial crises have become more interconnected, which requires an international lender of last resort because domestic lenders cannot create foreign currency. Fischer says this role can and should be taken by the IMF even if it is not a central bank, since it has the ability to provide credit to the market irrespective of being unable to create new money in any \\"international currency\\". Fischer's central argument, that the ability to create money is not a necessary attribute of the lender of last resort, is highly controversial, and both Capie and Schwartz argue the opposite. Goodhart and Huang developed a model arguing \\"the international contagious risk is much higher when there is an international interbank market than otherwise. Our analysis has indicated that an ILOLR can play a useful role in providing international liquidity and reducing such international contagion.\\" \\"A lender- of-last-resort is what it is by virtue of the fact that it alone provides the ultimate means of payment. There is no international money and so there can be no international lender-of-last-resort.\\" That is the most prominent argument put against the international lender of last resort. Besides this point (considered \\"semantic\\" by opposing authors), Capie and Schwartz provide arguments for why the IMF is not fit to be an international lender of last resort. Schwartz explains that the lender of last resort is not the optimal solution to the crises of today, and the IMF cannot replace the necessary government agencies. Schwartz considers a domestic lender of last resort suitable to stabilize the international financial system, but the IMF lacks the properties necessary for the role of an international lender of last resort. =Practice= Tooze has argued that, during and since the credit crunch, the dollar has extended its reach as a global reserve currency;A Tooze, Crashed (Penguin 2019) p. 6 and p 266-8 and suggests further that, at the height of the crisis, through the Central bank liquidity swap lines, the Fed ‚Äúassured the key players in the global system...there was one actor in the system that would cover marginal imbalances with an unlimited supply of dollar liquidity. That precisely was the role of the global lender of last resort‚Äù.A Tooze, Crashed (Penguin 2019) p. 215 Concern as to whether the Fed is in a position to repeat its role as global LOLR is one of the forces behind calls for a formal global currency.L Chitu, How Global Currencies Work (2019) p. 198 In government bond markets Although the European Central Bank (ECB) has supplied large amounts of liquidity through both open market operations and lending to individual banks in 2008, it was hesitant to supply liquidity during the sovereign crisis of 2010. According to Paul De Grauwe, the ECB should be the lender of last resort in the government bond market and supply liquidity to its member countries just as it does to the financial sector. That is because the reasons that the lender of last resort is necessary in the banking sector can be applied to the government bond market analogously. Just like banks that lend long-term while borrowing short-term, governments have highly illiquid assets like infrastructure and maturing debt. If they do not succeed in rolling over their debt, they become illiquid just as banks that run out of liquidity and are not supported by a lender of last resort. The distrust of investors can then increase the rates the government has to pay on its debt, which, in a self-fulfilling way, leads to a solvency crisis. Because banks hold the greatest proportion of government debt, not saving the government may make it necessary to save the banks, in turn. \\"The single most important argument for mandating the ECB to be a lender of last resort in the government bond markets is to prevent countries from being pushed into a bad equilibrium.\\" Arguments put forth against a lender of last resort in the government bond market are the following: (1) inflation risk from an increase in the money stock; (2) losses to taxpayers because in the end they bear the losses of the ECB; (3) moral hazard: governments have an incentive to take more risk; (4) Bagehot's rule of not lending to insolvent institutions; and (5) violation of the statutes of the ECB, which do not allow the ECB to buy government bonds directly. According to De Grauwe, none of the arguments is valid for the following reason: (1) The money stock does not necessarily increase if the money base is increased. (2) All open market operations generate taxpayer risk, and if the lender of last resort is successful in preventing countries from moving into the bad equilibrium, it will not suffer any losses. (3) The risk of moral hazard is identical to the moral hazard in the financial market and should be overcome by risk-limiting regulation. (4) If the distinction between illiquid and insolvent were possible, the market would not need the support of the lender of last resort, but in practice, the distinction cannot be made. (5) While Article 21 of the treaty prohibits buying debt from national governments directly because it \\"implies a monetary financing of the government budget deficit,\\" Article 18 allows the ECB to buy and sell \\"marketable instruments,\\" and government bonds are marketable instruments. Finally, De Grauwe asserts that only the central bank itself has the necessary credibility to act as a lender of last resort and so it should replace the European Financial Stability Facility (and its successor, the European Stability Mechanism). The two institutions cannot guarantee that they will always possess enough liquidity or \\"fire power\\" to buy debt from sovereign bond holders.

He was the younger brother of Nicolas, who became a painter and etcher who was mainly active in Avignon and was known as Mignard d'Avignon.Albert Babeau, Nicolas Mignard - sa vie et ses oeuvres in: 'Annuaire administratif et statistique du d√©partement de l'Aube... / publi√© sous les auspices et la direction de la Soci√©t√© d'agriculture, sciences, arts et belles-lettres du d√©partement', Soci√©t√© acad√©mique de l'Aube, 1895, p. 113-124 Nicolas had two sons, Paul who became a painter and etcher and Pierre who became a painter and architect. To distinguish his nephew Pierre from his uncle, the nephew was called \\"Pierre II\\" or \\"Le Chevalier\\".5 Mignard artists listed by the Getty Union Artist Name List The Virgin with the grapes, 1640 Pierre Mignard trained in Bourges with the Mannerist painter Jean Boucher. He later spent time making copies of the Mannerist works in the ch√¢teau of Fontainebleau. He then studied for a period in the studio of Simon Vouet. Mignard left for Rome in 1635 where he would stay about 22 years. It is because of his long residence in Rome that he got the nickname 'Mignard le Romaine'. In Rome he painted religious commissions. He was particularly known for his many images of the Madonna and Child. They were so popular that they were referred to as \\"Mignardises.\\" He also painted altarpieces. Compatriot Nicolas Poussin hired Mignard to make copies of his works. He was also active as a reproductive engraver making copies after Annibale Carracci. Mignard also developed his lifelong interest in portraiture at this time, and he painted portraits of subsequent popes, cardinals, and prominent members of the Italian nobility. He also travelled to Northern Italy where he visited Bologna, Parma, Mantua, Florence and Venice.Pierre Mignard I at the National Gallery of Art Portrait of Louise de K√©rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth His reputation was such that he was summoned to Paris in 1657, probably by Cardinal Mazarin. He travelled back via Avignon where his brother Nicolas worked. Here he met the dramatist Moli√®re, who became a close friend and of whom he painted several portraits. In Paris he became a popular portrait painter. He found favor with king Louis XIV who sat for many portraits. Mignard became a rival of the leading French painter of that time and first painter to the King, Charles Le Brun. He declined to enter the Academy of which Le Brun was the head. Mignard also opposed the authority of the Academy. His brother Nicolas and his nephew Paul, who was his pupil, chose the side of Le Brun against Pierre, which led to a break in the relationship.Andr√© Fontaine, 'Documents sur Pierre Mignard, Paul Mignard et Charles Le Brun', in: Archives de l'art fran√ßais: recueil de documents in√©dits publi√©s par la Soci√©te de l'histoire de l'art fran√ßais, J. Schemit, 1907, p. 311-318 With the death of Le Brun in 1690, the situation changed. Mignard succeeded to all the posts held by his opponent. He died in 1695 at Paris as he was about to begin work on the cupola of Les Invalides. Work Mignard was mainly active as a portrait painter. He also produced mythological and religious scenes. Soon after his return to Paris, Mignard was able to attract the patronage of important personalities who commissioned portraits of him. His sitters included Turenne, Moli√®re, Bossuet, Maintenon (in the Louvre), La Valli√®re, S√©vign√©, Montespan, Descartes (in Castle Howard). He was thus one of the most successful portrait painters of his time although according to some art historians also the most boring one.Anthony Blunt, The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 121, No. 918 (Sep., 1979), pp. 603‚Äì605+607 Ecce homo, 1690 Many of compositions were engraved by G√©rard Audran, Pieter van Schuppen, Robert Nanteuil, G√©rard Edelinck, Antoine Masson, Fran√ßois de Poilly and others.Works after Pierre Mignard at the British Museum There is a good selection of works by Pierre, Nicolas, and Pierre II in Avignon at the Mus√©e Calvet.

Ten of the fourteen participating nations earned medals, in addition to three medals won by mixed teams, i.e. teams made up of athletes from multiple nations. The United States won the most gold medals (11) with 14 athletes participating, while host nation, Greece with 169 athletes participating, won the most medals overall (46) as well as the most silver (17) and bronze (19) medals, finishing with one less gold medal than the United States, having 155 athletes more than the US. In the early Olympic Games, several team events were contested by athletes from multiple nations. Retroactively, the IOC created the designation \\"Mixed team\\" (with the country code ZZX) to refer to these group of athletes. Some athletes won medals both individually and as part of a mixed team, so these medals are tabulated under different nations in the official counts. Dionysios Kasdaglis, an athlete of Greek origins living in Alexandria, Egypt, is listed by the IOC as Greek during his competition in the singles tennis competition but Kasdaglis and his doubles tennis teammate, Greek athlete Demetrios Petrokokkinos, are listed a mixed team. During these inaugural Olympics, winners were given a silver medal and an olive branch, while runners-up received a copper medal and a laurel branch. The IOC has retroactively assigned gold, silver and bronze medals to the three best placed athletes in each event to comport with more recent traditions. Three ties resulted in medals being shared between athletes, increasing the medal count of various nations. These include ties between Francis Lane of the United States and Alajos Szokolyi of Hungary, for the third place in the 100 metres; between Evangelos Damaskos and Ioannis Theodoropoulos of Greece in the pole vault; and between Konstantinos Paspatis of Greece and Momcsill√≥ Tapavicza of Hungary, in singles tennis. In addition, bronze medals were not awarded in a number of events where there was no third-place finisher. Medal count James Connolly of the United States won the triple jump event at the 1896 Summer Olympics. This is the full table of the medal count of the 1896 Summer Olympics, based on the medal count of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). There are sources, besides the International Olympic Committee (IOC), that display variations in the medal totals, but as the governing body of the Olympic Games, the IOC is considered the most authoritative source for the purposes of this article. These rankings sort by the number of gold medals earned by a country. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. This information is provided by the IOC, however the IOC does not recognise or endorse any ranking system.

His maternal grandfather was Chief Wahunsenacah, the leader of the Powhatan tribe in Virginia. Early life Thomas Rolfe was born in Virginia to John Rolfe and his wife, Pocahontas, in January of 1615. Rolfe's birth was recorded as the first time a child was born to a Virginian Native American woman and an English man in Virginia's history. Governor Sir Thomas Dale was accompanied by Thomas Rolfe and his parents on their trip to England aboard the Treasurer in 1616.Robert S. Tilton, \\"Rolfe, John (1585‚Äì1622)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online ed., September 2012 Thomas Rolfe was less than two years of age during this voyage. In March 1617, the Rolfe family were preparing to re-embark on the George ship commanded by Samuel Argall when Rebecca (Pocahontas) was taken ill and died, at Gravesend in Kent. Thomas was not well enough to survive the long voyage back to Jamestown and Thomas was left in Plymouth, England, with Sir Lewis Stukley and later transferred into the care of his uncle, Henry Rolfe.Mossiker, Frances. Pocahontas: The Life and Legend. 1976. New York: Da Capo Press, 1996. pp. 213‚Äì313. His father, however, sailed to Virginia without him after being persuaded by Admiral Argall and other members of the journey that Thomas was too sick to continue the voyage; this was the last time the two ever saw each other.Price, David A. Love And Hate in Jamestown. New York: Alfred A. Knopf Publishing, 2003. p. 183. Print. Thomas remained in his uncle's care until he reached roughly 21 years of age, by which time his father had already died.Clausen, Christopher. \\"Between Two Worlds\\". The American Scholar 76.3 (2007): 80‚Äì90. ProQuest. As Henry raised Thomas, he felt he deserved compensation from his brother's estate and, therefore, petitioned the Virginia Council in October 1622, claiming entitlement to a portion of John Rolfe's land.Boddie, John Bennett. Colonial Surry. Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing, 1974. Web., March 12, 2013. It is assumed that Thomas returned to Virginia in 1635, and there is no further mention of his whereabouts or doings until 1641.Barbour, Philip L. Pocahontas and Her World. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1969. pp. 184, 214. Print. Once established in Virginia again, Thomas Rolfe fostered both his reputation as a plantation owner and member of his mother's lineage. Family As Rolfe was a child of an Englishman and a Native American woman, some aspects of his life were particularly controversial. He expressed interest in rekindling relations with his Native American relatives, despite societal ridicule and laws that forbade such contact. In 1641, Rolfe petitioned the governor for permission to visit his \\"aunt, Cleopatra, and his kinsman Opecanaugh\\". Rolfe married Jane Poythress, the daughter of Captain Francis Poythress, a prosperous landowner in Virginia.\\"The Descendants of Pocahontas: An Unclosed Case\\", by Elizabeth Vann Moore and Richard Slatten, Magazine of Virginia Genealogy, XXIII, no.3, pp. 3‚Äì16, cited by John Frederick Dorman, Adventurers of Purse and Person, 4th ed., Vol. 3, p. 26, fn23‚Äì24. Moore and Slatten traced the suggestion that his wife was a Poythress back to a comment by W. G. Stanard in \\"Abstracts of Virginia Land Patents\\", Virginia Historical Magazine(I, 1894, 446‚Äì447): \\"His wife is said to have been a Miss Poythress (if so, doubtless a daughter of Francis Poythress.\\" According to Moore and Slatten, Stanard cited as evidence handwritten notes on the flyleaf of a copy of A Complete Collection of All the Laws of Virginia Now in Force Carefully Copied from the Assembled Records (London, 168[?], now in the Library of Virginia. Moore and Slatten state: \\"Interestingly, Thomas Rolfe here is recorded as married to a 'Miss Payers'. We recall that in John Rolfe's will the name of his third wife is spelt Pyers (Peirce) and that it was John who married a \\"Jane\\". Here again a Bolling descendant confused the son with his father. Not recognizing the name 'Payers' as another variant of Peirce, someone searched the records for a name beginning with 'P' and having a 'y' in the first syllable. Francis Poythress lived in adjacent Charles City County and his name ended in s! Stanard wrote, 'His wife is said to have been a Miss Poythress (if so, doubtless a daughter of Francis Poythress).' (VMHB I, 446) Wyndham Robertson, a Bolling descendant, wrote in Pocahontas Alias Mataoke and Her Descendants (Richmond, 1887), 'I adopt \\"Jane Poythress\\" (not \\"Poyers\\") whom he is stated in the Bolling Memoirs to have married in England.' He added in justification of his charming adoption of an ancestress, '...no such name as \\"Poyers\\" is anywhere known ... the family of Poythress was already settled in Virginia.' ... The result has been the acceptance of a non-existent personage, 'Jane Poythress', in the Bibles of Virginia genealogy, as the bona fide ancestress of many illustrious Virginians. Who the wife (or wives) of Thomas Rolfe may have been remains an unanswered question.\\" Their daughter, Jane Rolfe, was born at Varina plantation, Henrico County, Virginia on October 10, 1650.John Frederick Dorman, Adventurers of Purse and Person, 4th ed., Vol. 3, pp. 23‚Äì36. Land According to his father's will, both Thomas and Elizabeth, his half-sister, received named land. There is no extant proof that some land came from the Native Americans. However Native Americans did not 'hold' land in the English way. There is no mention of former Native American land in John Rolfe's will, however, John Rolfe names Thomas as the rightful heir of all his land, profits and any royalties pertaining to such land. There were rumors in 1618 that when Thomas came of age, he would inherit a sizable portion of Powhatan territory; this information was transmitted through Argall to London, stating, \\"'Opechanano and the Natives have given their Country to Rolfe's Child and that they will reserve it from all others till he comes of yeares....\\" (Mossiker). There is no extant documentation that when Thomas arrived in Virginia in 1640, the land was recorded as \\"Varina,\\" his patrimonial property sixteen miles below Richmond. Thomas's step-grandfather, named Captain William Peirce, received a grant of 2000 acres of land on June 22, 1635, for the \\"transportation of 40 persons among whom was Thomas Rolfe\\". He then listed Thomas as heir to his father's land. Prior to March 1640, Thomas took possession of this land which was located on the lower side of the James River.McCartney, Martha W. \\"Thomas Rolfe\\". Virginia Immigrants and Adventurers, 1607‚Äì1635: A Biographical Dictionary. Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing, 2007. p. 608. Print. Thomas also inherited a tract of some 150 acres on June 10, 1654, in Surry County, across from Jamestown; the land was described in a later deed as \\"Smith's Fort old field and the Devil's Woodyard swamp being due unto the said Rolfe by Gift from the Indian King\\". The year after the 1644 Native American attack on the colony, four forts were established to defend the frontier: Fort Henry, Fort Royal, Fort James, and Fort Charles. Fort James was to be under the command of Thomas Rolfe as lieutenant as of October 5, 1646. He was given six men, and was instructed to fight against the Native Americans‚Äîhis own people; Site of the fort on Diascund Creek Then, on October 6, 1646, Thomas was put in charge of building a fort at Moysonec, for which he received of land. This fort was located on the west side of Diascund Creek. Several years later, Rolfe patented 525 acres on August 8, 1653, \\"...lying upon the North side of Chickahominy river commonly called and known by the name of James fort...\\", apparently including the 400 acres he had received in 1646.Land Office Patent Bk 3, p. 13. This James Fort land was re patented by William Browne on April 23, 1681.Land Office Patent Bk 7, p. 96 The tract was described in the patent as \\"formerly belonging to Mr Thomas Rolfe, dec'd\\", thus establishing that Rolfe had died before that date. Death The last recorded mention of Thomas Rolfe exists in a land patent from September 16, 1658. While some sources claim that Thomas died in 1680, others claim that the exact year is unknown. Some evidence purports that Thomas Rolfe died in James City County, Virginia, however the records of the county were destroyed in 1685 during a fire. Legacy The Sedgeford Hall Portrait, once believed to represent Pocahontas and her son, has been re-identified as being Pe-o-ka (wife of Osceola) and their son. Rolfe's daughter, Jane Rolfe, married Robert Bolling of Prince George County, Virginia; the couple's son, John Bolling, was born on January 27, 1676. Jane Rolfe is said to have died shortly after giving birth. John Bolling married Mary Kennon, daughter of Richard Kennon and Elizabeth Worsham of Conjurer's Neck. John and Mary Bolling had six surviving children, each of whom married and had surviving children.Henrico County Deeds & Wills 1697‚Äì1704, p. 96 The Sedgeford Hall Portrait, once believed to represent Pocahontas and her son Thomas Rolfe, has been re-identified as being Pe-o-ka, wife of the Seminole leader Osceola, and their son.Navab, Valorie. American Indian Summer 2013. Smithsonian Institution. http://content.yudu.com/A2702l/Summer2013/resources/40.htm The birth of Thomas Rolfe, as he was both of European and Native American descent, reinstated peace between the Powhatans and the European settlements. Early in his career as deputy governor, Argall reported in a letter published within the Virginia Company Records that Powhatan \\"goes from place to place visiting his country taking his pleasure in good friendship with us laments his daughter's death but glad her child is living so doth opachank\\".

The screenplay by Harron and Guinevere Turner focuses on 1950s pinup and bondage model Bettie Page, portrayed by Gretchen Mol. Plot Bettie Page is an ambitious, na√Øve, and devout young Christian woman who longs to leave Nashville, Tennessee, following a childhood of sexual abuse, a failed wartime marriage, and a gang rape. In 1949, she departs for New York City, where she enrolls in an acting class. Amateur photographer Jerry Tibbs discovers her walking on the beach at Coney Island and she agrees to model for him. He suggests she restyle her hair with the bangs that would become her trademark. Bettie becomes a favorite of nature photographers (including Bunny Yeager, who films her posing with two leopards), and she has no hesitation about removing her clothes for the photographers when asked. Before long images of the shapely brunette reach brother-and-sister entrepreneurs Paula and Irving Klaw, who run a respectable business selling movie stills and memorabilia, but also deal with fetish photos, magazines, and 8- and 16-millimeter films for additional income. Their top model Maxie takes Bettie under her wing, and she soon finds herself wearing leather corsets and thigh-high boots while wielding whips and chains for photographer John Willie, frequently at the request of Little John, a mild-mannered attorney with unusual tastes. Bettie is innocently unaware of the sexual nature of the images that rapidly are making her a star in the underground world of bondage aficionados. In 1955, Bettie is called to testify before a hearing, headed by Senator Estes Kefauver, investigating the effects of pornography on American youth. Though she waits patiently for 12 hours to answer the committee's questions, Kefauver, for reasons unknown, decides to not bring her before the committee and dismisses her without an explanation. When it becomes apparent that casting directors are more interested in her notoriety than in any acting talent she might possess, Bettie heads to Miami Beach. Drifting along with limited career prospects and a virtually nonexistent social life, she stumbles upon a small evangelical church, walks inside and rushes forward to embrace Jesus Christ during the altar call. Although she insists she is not ashamed of anything she has done in her life, she appears happy to leave her past behind and return to her spiritual roots by preaching the word of the Lord on street corners. Back in New York, Irving is stressed out and suffering from poor health. He decides that he and his sister must burn their vast collection of erotic photos and movie footage to avoid potential prosecution. Paula reluctantly complies with her brother's request, but secretly saves the negatives of many of Bettie's pictures and movies from the bonfire, therefore ensuring that Bettie's work will survive for future generations.

While writing the script, Harron knew she wanted to film the Miami scenes in color in order to provide a sharp contrast between Bettie's professional life and the escape she ultimately made from it. Cinematographer W. Mott Hupfel III used old color stock to approximate the cheerfully vivid hues of Technicolor common in 1950s films. Actress/screenwriter Guinevere Turner, who co-wrote the film with Mary Harron, was originally slated to star as Bettie Page but the role was given to Gretchen Mol when producers had difficulty raising money.Guinevere Turner interview Harron said from Mol's first audition, she was her first choice for the role. Harron said, \\"Emotionally she was so right. She has a natural sort of decorum. So many people made the mistake of being very vampy. At that point, I said, 'Well, you know, it's more important to get the inner Bettie than the outer Bettie.'\\" Release The film premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival and was shown at the Berlin International Film Festival and the South by Southwest Film Festival before going into limited release in the United States on April 14, 2006. Opening on twenty screens, it grossed $143,131 in its opening weekend. It eventually earned $1,415,082 in the United States and $362,924 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $1,778,006. The film was released on DVD in the United States on September 26, 2006.Slant MagazineDVD Talk Critical reception The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 57% approval rating based on 134 reviews. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times observed, \\"Until now, Ms. Mol has been best known for her premature designation several years ago as Hollywood's newest It girl. The label seemed to plague her, and she all but faded from view despite promising turns in little-seen films. Maybe because she felt protected by her female director and female producers (six out of seven), or emboldened by the material, or maybe because she knows how beautiful her gently padded silhouette looks in the raw, Ms. Mol takes to this tricky role with the carefree expressivity you tend to see only in young children who have learned the joys of nudity, usually when their parents are throwing a dinner party. When she strips, Bettie soars\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said \\"The tone of the movie is subdued and reflective. It does not defend pornography, but regards it (in its 1950s incarnation) with subdued nostalgia for a more innocent time. There is a kind of sadness in the movie as we reflect that most of these women and the men they inflamed are now dead; their lust is like an old forgotten song\\".Chicago Sun-Times review Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle stated the film \\"floats on the charm and the labors of its lead actress, Gretchen Mol, who single-handedly makes the picture worth seeing. She takes a character that is next door to a cipher and infuses her with innocence and mischief, wit and feeling, despite limited help from the script. Perhaps through intuition or through some careful study of Page's pinups, Mol has discovered a human being to play, and in the process has found her best screen showcase to date\\". Of Harron and Turner he said \\"They tell Page's story in a curiously uninflected way, revealing little, if any, point of view, and imposing no meaning or particular importance on this woman's life. This approach is far from a recipe for high drama, but it has the integrity of accuracy. The audience is introduced to Bettie because the audience is perhaps interested in Bettie or her career or her era. But there's no pretending that her life was all that fascinating, or that her contribution to culture was significant, or that her story contains a lesson worth receiving... There's enough here for a good after-movie argument, and that's more than can be said for most pictures\\".San Francisco Chronicle review Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film three out of four stars and commented \\"Any old sleaze could turn Bettie's life into a kinky S&M; wallow, a cinematic stroke book. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's just that director Mary Harron, who co-wrote the scrappy script with Guinevere Turner, doesn't do the expected. She's too sly for that, too subversively funny... [She] needed just the right actress to play Bettie. And she lucked out big time. Gretchen Mol is hot stuff in every sense of the term. She delivers the first performance by an actress this year that deserves serious Oscar consideration\\".Rolling Stone review Todd McCarthy of Variety called the film \\"a superficial look at the '50s sex icon [that] feels like it was researched via press clippings rather than attempting a fresh rethinking of its era and provocative subject\\". He added \\"Mary Harron's work here seems curiously uninvolved. There's no sense of any particular commitment to the leading character... [The] result is a strangely placid, unchallenging picture with no blood in its veins... Gretchen Mol is splendid to behold in every stage of dress or undress, but Harron and co-scenarist Guinevere Turner offer no clues as to what might be going on inside the dark-haired beauty's head and heart... Mol's Bettie is compliant, almost always open to any request and never disagreeable. But her lack of spine and inner turmoil make her a central figure of limited interest, that rare dramatic heroine with no ambition or goal\\".Variety review Awards and nominations Mol was nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama,Gretchen MolMovie and Film AwardsAllMovie but lost to Helen Mirren in The Queen.

A total of 2,399 athletes from 77 countries (+5 from 1998 Olympics) participated in these Games, competing in 78 events (+10 from 1998) in 15 sports and disciplines (+1 from 1998). Athletes from 24 countries won at least one medal. Germany led in overall medals (36) for the second consecutive Winter Games. Immediately following the Games, Germany was also the gold medal leader with twelve. With 36 total medals, Germany set a record for most total medals at a Winter Olympics. Two years later, however, Norway was awarded two extra gold medals, raising their total to thirteen and giving them the lead in gold medals. In addition, Norway tied the former Soviet Union in 1976 for most gold medals at a Winter Olympics. This record would later be broken by Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics. The United States, the host nation, was third in the medal count with a total of 34 medals. Croatia and Estonia won the first medals and first Gold medals in their Winter Olympic history, while Australia and China won their first gold medals. Biathlete Ole Einar Bj√∏rndalen of Norway won four gold medals, while Croatian alpine skier Janica Kosteliƒá won three golds and a silver, making them the two athletes with the most medals at the Games. Changes in medal standings Due to various events, two extra gold medals were awarded. In the figure skating pairs competition, Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia were originally awarded the gold over Jamie Sal√© and David Pelletier of Canada. In the ensuing controversy, it was revealed that French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne had been pressured into voting for the Russians. Sal√© and Pelletier were later upgraded to gold, while Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze also kept their medals. In the cross-country skiing 30 km race, Norwegians Thomas Alsgaard and Frode Estil originally tied for a silver medal behind Spain's Johann Muehlegg. Muehlegg had won three gold medals but tested positive for darbepoetin after winning his third. He was originally allowed to keep the other two gold medals, but two years later was stripped of all medals by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In women's cross-country skiing, Larisa Lazutina of Russia originally won gold in the 30 km race, but tested positive for darbepoetin and was stripped of her medal, so Gabriella Paruzzi of Italy was awarded the gold, Italian Stefania Belmondo received the silver and Norwegian Bente Skari the bronze. Lazutina won two more medals, and was allowed to keep them until 2003 when she was stripped of them by the Court of Arbitration for sport. She also lost a silver medal in the 15 km race. In the 10 km pursuit, she was stripped of a silver, so Beckie Scott of Canada was awarded the silver and Kate≈ôina Neumannov√° of the Czech Republic the bronze. The gold in that race was won by Olga Danilova of Russia but she also tested positive for darbepoetin and in 2004, Scott was upgraded to gold, Neumannova to silver and Viola Bauer of Germany to bronze. Medal table The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically.

From September 13, 2010, to October 2016, Bush co-hosted the syndicated national daily entertainment talk show Access Hollywood Live, along with co-host Kit Hoover. This show is a sister show of Access Hollywood, with host chat of popular topics and celebrity live interviews. Bush and Hoover traveled together to the UK to cover Prince William's wedding to Catherine Middleton, as part of the NBC team coverage. Bush played the drill sergeant in the 2010 film Furry Vengeance and had a small role as the voice of a newscaster in the 2014 Disney animated film Big Hero 6. He has also had several appearances on television shows including 30 Rock and Donny!.\\"Billy Bush>Filmography\\", IMDb. Retrieved January 9, 2017. =Today= In May 2016, Bush was selected to be the co-host of the third hour of NBC's Today. He served as a replacement for Willie Geist. Ryan Lochte controversy Bush was the first reporter to interview American Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte after the athlete claimed he was robbed at gunpoint in Rio de Janeiro during the 2016 Summer Olympics. Bush's due diligence as an interviewer was scrutinized after critics claimed Bush did not ask questions that would have shown Lochte's story was fabricated. When details of Lochte's story began to fall apart, Matt Lauer re-interviewed the swimmer in a move that was seen as a snub to Bush. Bush garnered attention once again after he and Al Roker got into an argument during Olympic coverage on Today after Lochte was exposed. Bush defended Lochte, saying he lied about \\"some\\" details whereas Roker characterized Lochte's statement as a lie. Trump tape scandal On October 7, 2016, The Washington Post reported that video footage was released of Donald Trump having a lewd conversation with Bush, with Trump either unaware or unconcerned that his microphone was active. Bush is heard laughing about Trump's failed effort to seduce a married woman, and joining in by commenting on actress Arianne Zucker's appearance, calling her \\"hot as shit.\\" The video was made on the NBC Studios lot in the course of videotaping an Access Hollywood episode in mid-September 2005, promoting Trump's cameo appearance in an episode of daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives to promote The Apprentice. In the video, Trump discussed a failed attempt to seduce Bush's then-co-host Nancy O'Dell: \\"I moved on her, and I failed. I‚Äôll admit it. I did try and fuck her. She was married.\\" He also talked about stars groping women: \\"...you just kiss...when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything [Bush: Anything you want]...grab them by the pussy...\\" When the news of the footage first broke, Bush was at New York's JFK International Airport waiting to take off for Los Angeles. He spent the six-hour flight reading news reports on the unfolding controversy. By the time he arrived in Los Angeles, a horde of paparazzi had materialized at Los Angeles International Airport and at his home in Los Angeles, where they remained for more than a week. Bush spent the remainder of that weekend trying to save his job at Today, which had already garnered controversy, first over Bush's lack of hard-news experience and the rude tone he exhibited during red carpet events and then over the Ryan Lochte matter. Initially, NBC News signaled Bush would return that Monday to apologize on-air. Bush later stated, \\"I would have welcomed addressing the audience.\\" However, Bush received criticism online and calls for his resignation from the show, with The Washington Post stating, \\"Bush's public image was damaged‚Äîperhaps beyond repair.\\" He issued an apology, stating: \\"Obviously I'm embarrassed and ashamed. It's no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago. I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I'm very sorry.\\" Bush was 33 years old at the time the video was made. On October 9, 2016, NBC announced that Bush was suspended from Today for his role in the 2005 video. He was suspended pending an internal review. By October 17, Bush had been fired. After The New York Times reported in late November 2017 that Trump had privately told people, including a sitting senator, that the voice on the tape was not his, Bush published an op-ed in the paper on December 3, reaffirming that the voice in the tape was the president's and accusing him of engaging in revisionist history. Extra On May 8, 2019, Telepictures announced they would hire Bush to be the host of Extra. Bush replaced Mario Lopez at the start of the 26th season on September 9, 2019, in a revamp of the show, which was originally to be renamed ExtraExtra. Personal life He married Sydney Davis in April 1998 and the couple has three daughters. On September 19, 2016, the couple announced they were separating. On July 15, 2018, Bush and his wife announced their divorce due to irreconcilable differences.

The medals are silver, gold, and bronze from left to right. The 1998 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XVIII Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Nagano, Japan, from 7 to 22 February 1998. Twenty-four nations earned medals at these Games, and fifteen won at least one gold medal; forty- eight countries left the Olympics without winning a medal. Competitors from Germany earned the highest number of gold medals (12) and the most overall medals (29). With 10 gold medals and 25 overall medals, Norway finished second in both categories. Denmark won its first ‚Äì and as of 2018 only ‚Äì Winter Olympics medal, while Bulgaria and the Czech Republic won their first Winter Games gold medals. Azerbaijan, Kenya, Macedonia, Uruguay, and Venezuela competed for the first time, but none of them won a medal. Varying statistics are reported for the number of participants at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The Sports-Reference website states that 2,180 athletes from 72 nations participated in 68 events from 14 sports and disciplines. Olympic historian Bill Mallon, in his Historical Dictionary of the Olympic Movement, agrees with the figure of 2,180 participants.Mallon and Heijmans, p. 407. In contrast, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) website reports that 2,176 athletes competed at the Games. The sport of curling returned after a single appearance in the 1924 Olympics, snowboarding was added as a new sport, and women's ice hockey made its first appearance in the Olympics. The leading medal winner at the Games was Russian skier Larisa Lazutina, who won five medals, including three golds. The only other athlete to win three gold medals was Norwegian skier Bj√∏rn D√¶hlie, who won four medals overall, making him the first Winter Olympian to win twelve career medals, eight of which were gold. Nine other athletes won three medals, including three Germans.

The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. In the two-man bobsleigh competition, a tie meant that two gold medals were awarded, so no silver medal was awarded for that event. A tie for second in the men's Super G skiing competition meant that a pair of silver medals were given out, so no bronze medal was awarded for that event. In the four-man bobsleigh, a tie for third resulted in the awarding of two bronze medals. Due to these ties, the number of gold medals awarded was one more than the number of silver or bronze medals. In snowboarding, Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the gold medal in the men's Giant Slalom, but it was briefly stripped by the IOC after he tested positive for marijuana. After the Canadian Olympic Association filed an appeal, however, the IOC's decision was overturned.

It was released in Japan on April 14, 1999, and in North America on June 28, 1999. In it, the ball is a Pok√© Ball, and most of the objects on the table are Pok√©mon- related. Like any pinball game, the main objective is to get points, using the different modes of advances to score them at a higher rate. Pok√©mon Pinball has a secondary objective hinted at by the tagline \\"Gotta Catch 'em All,\\" which is to collect all 151 Pok√©mon to fill your Pok√©dex. The Pok√©dex is saved between individual games, so it can be built up over time.  Gameplay  There are two tables in the game: Red and Blue. Each table has its own details and gameplay elements. Each table has different playable \\"locations\\", which determine which Pok√©mon are available for capture. A subset of available locations are displayed slot-machine style in the beginning of a game, and pressing A will select a starting location and launch the first ball into play. After that, each table has its own mechanism for advancing to the next location, including the locations not available at the start of the game. \\"Catch Mode,\\" when activated, starts a 2-minute window of opportunity where the player can attempt to capture a Pok√©mon. Once you activate \\"catch mode,\\" the player must hit the pop bumpers 6 times. Each hit unlocks 1/6 of an image of the Pok√©mon currently available for capture. Once the image is complete, the Pok√©mon appears on the table, where it must be hit 4 times with the ball to be captured. \\"Evolution Mode,\\" when activated, starts a 2-minute window of opportunity in which the player selects a captured Pok√©mon (from the current game in progress only) and attempts to evolve it into another form. This is the only way to add the evolved form to the player's Pok√©dex. Once you select a Pok√©mon, the player must hit targets on the playfield. There are up to 7 targets on the red board, 6 on the blue board, but only 3 of them have items in them needed to evolve a Pok√©mon, with the others creating a time-wasting sequence before the player can hit targets again. If the player hits a target with an item, the item appears on the playfield and must be collected with the ball. Once the player has collected 3 items, the hole in the center of the board opens up. Sinking the ball in the hole successfully evolves the Pok√©mon.  Reception  Pok√©mon Pinball received generally positive reviews, holding an aggregate score of 81.73% at GameRankings. GameSpot gave it a score of 8.7, citing its use of the Game Boy Color's display and presentation. However, they also criticized the game, lamenting the lack of other pinball-related elements and the game's poor physics. They additionally criticized the built-in rumble feature, calling it \\"a waste [...] of an AAA battery\\" and a \\"nice novelty\\". San Jose Mercury News praised its rumble, however, noting that it \\"won them over\\". Los Angeles Times editor Aaron Curtiss called it a \\"great game\\". CNET called it \\"more than a shameless cash-in on the Pok√©mon phenomenon\\", calling it one of the best pinball games for the Game Boy Color. However, they criticized the \\"gratuitous Pikachu appearances\\" and the \\"incorrect physics\\" as detracting somewhat from the pinball experience. The New York Times editor Joe Hutsko called the rumble mechanic as innovative, stating that it will likely lead to more games that use rumble from other developers. GamesRadar listed Pok√©mon Pinball as one of the titles they want in the 3DS Virtual Console. In Japan, Famitsu magazine scored the game a 32 out of 40.„Ç≤„Éº„É†„Éú„Éº„Ç§ - „Éù„Ç±„É¢„É≥„Éî„É≥„Éú„Éº„É´. Weekly Famitsu. No.915 Pt.2. Pg.108. 30 June 2006. Pok√©mon Pinball received a \\"Gold\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. =Sequel= Pok√©mon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire is a pinball game based on Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire, and is the sequel to Pok√©mon Pinball for the third generation of Pok√©mon games. It was developed by Jupiter and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console. It was first revealed at E3 in 2003, and was released in the same year ‚Äì on August 1, August 25, and November 14 in Japan, North America, and PAL regions respectively. The North American release was done to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the North American release of Pok√©mon Red and Blue. In some ways, it plays like a traditional pinball game, where the objective is to get a high score by keeping the ball going as long as possible and completing objectives. It features Pok√©mon collection, where while the players play pinball, they must also capture Pok√©mon.

It is the ninth longest river in the United Kingdom, as well as the third longest and fastest-flowing river in Scotland. It is important for salmon fishing and whisky production.  Etymology  The origin of the name Spey is uncertain. A possible etymological genesis for the name Spey is Early Celtic *skwej-, meaning \\"thorn\\". The involvement of a Pictish form of Welsh ysbyddad, meaning \\"hawthorn\\", has been suggested, but adjudged unlikely. One proposal is a derivation from a Pictish cognate of Old Gaelic sce√Ød, \\"vomit\\" (c.f Welsh chwydu), which is dubious both on phonological and semantic grounds. Ptolemy named the river on his map of 150 as Tuesis. The name 'Spey' first appears in 1451.Ross, D. 2001 Scottish Place-names Birlinn, Edinburgh p200 Course Catchment of the River Spey within Scotland. Tributaries of the River Spey. The Spey is long. It rises at over at Loch Spey in Corrieyairack Forest in the Scottish Highlands, south of Fort Augustus. Some miles downstream from its source it is impounded by Spey Dam before continuing a descent through Newtonmore and Kingussie, crossing Loch Insh before reaching Aviemore, giving its name to Strathspey. From there it flows the remaining north-east to the Moray Firth, reaching the sea west of Buckie.Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 scale Landranger map sheets 28 Elgin, 34 Fort Augustus, 35 Kingussie, 36 Grantown & Aviemore and 42 Loch Rannoch On some sections of its course, the Spey changes course frequently, either gradually as a result of deposition and erosion from normal flow, or in a matter of hours as a result of spate. The Spey spates quickly due to its wide mountainous catchment area as a result of rainfall or snow-melt. Insh Marshes, areas of roughly on either side of the Spey in the lower reaches are designated by Scottish Natural Heritage as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, as are the extensive shingle systems at Spey Bay.  Tributaries  After leaving Loch Spey the river gathers numerous burns in the Corrieyarack, Sherramore and Glenshirra Forests. The first sizeable tributary is the Markie Burn which drops out of Glen Markie to the north to enter the waters of Spey impounded behind the Spey Dam. A further mile downstream the River Mashie enters from Strath Mashie to the south. The River Truim enters on the right bank a couple of miles above Newtonmore and the Highland Calder enters from Glen Banchor on the left bank at Spey Bridge at Newtonmore. At Kingussie the Spey is joined on its left bank by the River Gynack which runs through the town and downstream it is joined by the River Tromie which enters on the right bank. The sizeable River Feshie joins on the right bank at Kincraig and the River Druie does likewise at Aviemore. Several miles downstream the River Nethy joins from the east near Nethy Bridge and the River Dulnain originating in the Monadhliath contributes a considerable flow from the west near Dulnain Bridge. Between Grantown-on-Spey and Craigellachie, the Burn of Tulchan and Allt a Gheallaidh join from the west whilst the Spey's most important tributary, the River Avon joins from the east. The Allt Arder and Knockando Burn also join from the west near Knockando. The River Fiddich enters from the right at Craigellachie and the Burn of Rothes enters from the left at Rothes. Downstream more burns enter the Spey, the most important of which are the Burn of Mulben, Red Burn and Burn of Fochabers. Industry The River Spey in spate at the Garmouth old rail bridge The river traditionally supported many local industries, from the salmon fishing industry to shipbuilding. At one stage, Garmouth functioned as the shipbuilding capital of Britain, with timber from the forests around Aviemore and Aberlour being rafted down to create wooden-hulled ships. The river is known by anglers for the quality of its salmon and trout fishing, including a particular form of fly fishing where the angler uses a double-handed fly rod to throw a 'Spey cast' whereby the fly and the line do not travel behind the fisher (thereby keeping these away from the bushes and trees lining the banks behind him or her). This type of cast was developed on the Spey. Speyside distilleries produce more whisky than any other region. Scotland's Malt Whisky Trail is a tourism initiative featuring seven working Speyside distilleries, a historic distillery and the Speyside Cooperage. The concept was created in the early 1980s. The region is a natural for whisky distillers because of three benefits: it is close to barley farms, contains the River Spey and is close to the port of Garmouth. The Speyside Way, a long-distance footpath, follows the river through the County of Moray. The River Spey is unusual in that its speed increases as it flows closer to the sea, due to a broadly convex long-profile. The mean flow is around (this needs to be checked since a flow velocity of 16m/s would cause serious erosion of the river bed and banks (V T Chow, Open channel hydraulics, McGraw Hill, 1973)) making it the fastest flowing river in Scotland, and possibly the UK (depending on what constitutes a river). The Spey does not meander, although it rapidly moves its banks. South of Fochabers a high earth barrier reinforces the banks, but the river has broken through on several occasions, removing a large portion of Garmouth Golf Course, sections of wall surrounding Gordon Castle, parts of the Speyside Way and some of the B9104 road. The Spey railway bridge (pedestrianised ) Spey Bay to Garmouth was originally designed with its main span over the main flow of the river, however before construction was completed the river had changed its course and was running at one end of the bridge.

The nature of nursing education and nursing qualifications varies considerably across the world. Since the mid 20th century nursing education in many countries has undergone many enhancements. History of nursing schools =United Kingdom= Florence Nightingale was one of the pioneers in establishing the idea of nursing schools from her base at St Thomas' Hospital, London in 1860 when she opened the 'Nightingale Training School for Nurses', now part of King's College London. Her intention was to train nurses to a qualified and specialized level, with the key aim of learning to develop observation skills and sensitivity to patient needs, then allow them to work in hospital posts across the United Kingdom and abroad. Her influence flourished and nursing is now a course taught at a number of British universities. Apart from the nursing school of King's College London, the direct descendant of Nightingale's school, the University of Manchester was one of the first English institutions to offer the course at degree level. A new building for the Manchester Medical School was opened in the early 1970s and degree courses in nursing were established about the same time. Nursing education at the university expanded greatly in 1996 when a new School of Nursing and Midwifery was created by transferring the Manchester College of Midwifery and Nursing into the university's Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing.\\"This week / next week\\" (University of Manchester); 7 Oct. 1996, p. 1 Entry level courses, sought by most universities, are often five Standard Grades/GCSEs, including English, maths and a science (preferably biology), and two Highers/A-Levels. Mature students, over the age of twenty-one, have the option of entering upon completion of a college Access course, and experience in jobs related to health/nursing assistance are also worthy for consideration into the course. Currently, nursing is a three-year course in the UK, with students choosing the branch that they want to study, e.g., adult, child, mental health, or learning disability; or combinations of two (called dual- field). The course consists of a balance between coursework in classes and practical placements in a health care setting. The first year is foundation, where students learn anatomy and physiology and basic health care. Newly qualified nurses then have to register with the Nursing and Midwifery Council in order to apply for jobs and legally practice. =United States= The history of nursing education had a long and varied role in the United States. Before the late 1800s little formal education was available to train nursing students. Education was primarily based on an apprenticeship with a senior nurse who taught bedside care within a hospital or clinic setting. Over time this model changed dramatically. A short chronology of Schools of Nursing in the United States is: The nursing pin awarded to graduates of the nursing school at Sacramento State University in the USA. * In 1873, the Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing, of New York City, was founded. It was the first school of nursing in the United States to be founded on the principles of nursing established by Florence Nightingale. The School operated at Bellevue Hospital until its closure in 1969. * 1883: The Medical University of South Carolina College of Nursing has been traced to its beginning in 1883 when the South Carolina Training School for Nurses was established at the request of Roper Hospital (known then as City Hospital) in Charleston, SC. Due to an earthquake in 1886 which destroyed the City Hospital, the effort only lasted a few years. However, once the new hospital was built the nursing program was reestablished in 1895 as the Charleston Training School. In 1916, the Board of Commissioners of the Roper Hospital proposed the transfer of the training school to the Medical College of the State of South Carolina, whose school of medicine had been established in Charleston in 1824 and whose faculty was already providing most of the nursing instruction. The proposal was accepted by both the hospital and the Medical College, and in 1919 the Roper Hospital Training School for Nurses became the School of Nursing of the Medical College of the State of South Carolina. In 1969 when the Medical College was designated the Medical University of South Carolina, the School of Nursing became the College of Nursing. *1889: The University of Maryland School of Nursing (UMSON) was founded by Louisa Parsons, a graduate of the Nightingale Fund School at St. Thomas' Hospital in London.https://www.nursing.umaryland.edu/about/mission-and-vision/history/ UMSON is one of the oldest and largest nursing schools in the United States.https://www.nursing.umaryland.edu/museum/virtual-tour/foundation/ * 1889: The Johns Hopkins School of Nursing was founded in conjunction with the creation of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. As one of the earliest hospital-based nursing schools in the United States school leaders consulted with Florence Nightingale on the program of education. These same nurse leaders also established what would be become the National League for Nursing Education and helped in establishing the American Nurses Association.About. Johns Hopkins Medicine; [cited 26 May 2014]. * In 1909, the University of Minnesota offered the first university based nursing program. It offered the first Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree and graduated the first bachelor's degree educated nurse. *By 1916 13 universities and 3 colleges had developed bachelor's nursing degree programs. * In 1923, the Yale School of Nursing was founded. It became the first School of Nursing to adopt the educational standards from the 1923 Goldmark Report that was requested by the Rockefeller Foundation. The curriculum was based on an educational plan rather than on hospital service needs. * In 1956, the Columbia University School of Nursing became the first in the United States to grant a master's degree in a clinical nursing specialty.  United States curriculum Pre-requisites often include math, English, and other basic level courses. Basic courses in biology, anatomy and physiology are required. Depending on the nursing school, credits can be taken elsewhere, and transferred in, although limitations on time span between taking pre-requisites and applying to nursing programs exist, usually around 5 years, although some schools set no parameters. Core coursework includes anatomy, physiology, pathology, and pharmacology. Additionally, a strong emphasis is placed on procedural education such as insertion of intravenous and urinary catheters, sterile dressing changes, proper administration of medications, physical examinations, caring bedside manner, and other vital skills. After the first semester basic skills are obtained, students rotate through Obstetrics, Mental Health, Medical, Surgical, Oncology, Critical Care and Pediatric Units to get a holistic view of nursing and what it encompasses. Many nursing students and nursing schools use medical and healthcare educational software as a study or training aid. Many schools offer an accelerated bachelor's degree in nursing program. A variation of the Second Degree BSN is the Accelerated BSN. In addition to giving credit for having completed liberal arts requirements, an Accelerated BSN program allows students to complete their undergraduate nursing program's course requirements more quickly than students enrolled in a traditional BSN program. Accelerated BSN programs usually take 12 months to complete, though some programs may run for 16 to 24 months. The traditional BSN programs may take much longer time. For example, in California, where nursing is a relatively high-paid and in high demand profession, the completion of BSN (including pre-requisites, major courses in the program, and General Education courses of college) may take 5 to 6 years. A 3.0 GPA is often an entrance requirement for many programs. Some more prestigious schools require much higher GPA score to be competitive. Many programs now also require TEAS-V test scores to evaluate potential students for entry. Also, there are other options of Associate Degree for RN and LPN programs (which in term of nursing training is much shorter and the scope of practice is different than RN). Lastly, the Master level is for experienced RNs to reach a higher education and may expand their scope of practice. In the United States, students graduate from nursing education programs qualified to take one of the NCLEX (National Council Licensure Examination) exams, the NCLEX-PN for Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) or the NCLEX-RN for Registered Nurses RNs.

A total of 1,423 athletes representing 57 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) (+8 from 1984 Olympics) participated in 46 events (+7 from 1984) from 10 different sports and disciplines (unchanged from 1984). Five new events were contested at these Games‚Äîmen's and women's Super G in alpine skiing, team events in Nordic combined and ski jumping, and women's 5000 metres in speed skating‚Äîand two events returned to the program‚Äîmen's and women's combined in alpine skiing. As in the 1984 Winter Olympics, 17 NOCs won at least one medal and 11 of them secured at least one gold medal. The Soviet Union returned to the top of the gold medal count with 11, relegating East Germany‚Äîwhich took first place four years earlier‚Äîto second place with nine. The Soviet Union also collected the most overall medals (29), including the most bronzes (9). In a repeat of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and mimicking Yugoslavia at the 1984 Winter Games, Canada, as host nation, did not win any gold medal, totalling two silver and three bronze medals. Canadian hopes for a gold rested on the shoulders of figure skater Brian Orser, the reigning World champion and silver medalist at the Sarajevo Games. A tight contest with Brian Boitano of the United States ended with the American taking the Olympic title. Athletes from Norway failed to win any event in Calgary, making this the first and so far only time that the country ended the Winter Olympics without a single gold medal. Italy's two gold medals were won by the same athlete: Alberto Tomba, a first-time Olympian who was crowned Olympic champion in the alpine skiing's slalom and giant slalom events. Ski jumper Matti Nyk√§nen of Finland contributed to three of his nation's four gold medals by winning both individual events (first time by an Olympic ski jumper) and helping his team to win the collective title. The performance of the Swiss athletes ensured their nation's best result at the Winter Games, securing a record number of 15 medals, including a then-record of five gold medals that took 18 years to be improved. Five NOCs participated for the first time in the Winter Olympics‚ÄîFiji, Guam, Guatemala, Jamaica, and Netherlands Antilles‚Äîbut none of them won a medal. Jamaica's lone entry, the Jamaican bobsled team, inspired the making of the 1993 movie Cool Runnings. __TOC__ Medal table Italian alpine skier Alberto Tomba won his country's two gold medals in his first Olympic participation.

He was greatly renowned for his improvisational skills and, with a filmography comprising 90 movies, one of Denmark's most prolific actors. His life is depicted in the Danish semi-biographical film A Funny Man (2011, Danish title Dirch) directed by Martin Zandvliet.imdb.com - A Funny Man Life When he was young, Passer was very shy, but had an ambition to become an actor. Instead, he conformed to his father's wishes by attending the J. Lauritzen sea training school near Svendborg in 1944. But since he had persistent problems with seasickness, he later attended the drama school De frederiksbergske teatres Elevskole. During the 1950s he formed a duo with his colleague and friend Kjeld Petersen. Their revue sketches, based upon the contrast between Petersen‚Äôs mixture of joviality and desperate anger and Passer‚Äôs deadpan responses, are still considered classics by the public. The sudden death of Kjeld Petersen in 1962 led Passer to avoid revues for five years, but he built up an individual reputation and in 1967 he returned to the revue gaining new victories. Many thin jokes in the scripts were greatly improved by his performance. In particular, his many amiable eccentrics and \\"nature experts\\" together with his sketch roles as a baby and as a nonsense \\"Russian\\"-speaking clown made him famous. From his later years must be mentioned an almost silent sketch in which he portrays a man‚Äôs vain attempt to stop smoking (also shown in West German TV). It was told that he could speak any language, however he wouldn't understand any of it, which was one of his good qualities. In his life, Dirch Passer wanted to play more serious roles instead of remaining in comedy. However, his image as a comedian was so solid that his attempt to break into serious acting was a failure. Career He was often referred to as a loud actor in spite of the fact that under-acting was responsible for much of his force. A Danish critic, Jens Kistrup, once said that one of the secrets behind the comedy of Passer was its combination of elements that are normally regarded as incompatible. He possessed noisiness and discretion, loudness and quietness, boundlessness and complete control, craziness and softness -- all this combined with a special intimacy with the audience. Among his inspirations he mentioned Joe E. Brown but he was also known for his admiration of the British comedian Tommy Cooper. In his films, which were of very mixed quality, he often played kind and somewhat crazy \\"Everymen\\" or antiheroes. Among his best movie roles were stage roles transferred to film; here must be mentioned the hero in Charley‚Äôs Aunt (1959), Celestin-Floridor in Fr√∏ken Nitouche (1963) and Leopold in Summer in Tyrol (i.e. The White Horse Inn, 1964). Dirch Passer (right) with composer Aage Stentoft Numerous Danish actors see him as a role model. In day-to-day life he was quite shy in behaviour, somewhat the opposite of his theatrical appearances. He collapsed just off stage dressed as a clown for the opening number of the season premiere of Tivolirevyen, dying shortly after arrival at the hospital.

A total of 1,272 athletes representing 49 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in 39 events from 10 different sports and disciplines. First time NOCs to enter were Egypt, Monaco, Puerto Rico, Senegal, and British Virgin Islands. Seventeen NOCs won at least one medal and, among these, eleven secured at least one gold medal. For the first time since its debut at the 1968 Winter Olympics, East Germany topped the gold medal count with nine, three more than the Soviet Union, which had led this count in the past three Games. The Soviet delegation won the most overall medals (25), including the most silvers (10) and bronzes (9). The host nation, Yugoslavia, collected its first-ever medal at the Winter Olympics: a silver by alpine skier Jure Franko in the men's giant slalom. This was the third time that the Winter Olympics host team failed to win a gold medal, after France in 1924 and Switzerland in 1928. Austrian athletes secured a single medal‚Äîa bronze in men's alpine skiing downhill‚Äîin what is the nation's worst ever result at the Winter Games. In contrast, Czechoslovakia and Finland's performances in Sarajevo were historical bests, after collecting a total of six and thirteen medals, respectively. Finnish cross-country skier Marja-Liisa H√§m√§l√§inen was responsible for three of her NOC's four gold medals with a sweep of victories in the women's individual events, and contributed to the bronze in the team relay event. These Games also witnessed the best result by a Canadian team since the 1960 Winter Olympics, thanks mostly to the achievements of speed skater Ga√©tan Boucher. His wins in the men's 1,000 and 1,500 metres, and a third place in the 500 metres, earned Canada's two gold medals and three of its four medals. Sweden secured four golds for the first time since St. Moritz 1948, of which three were obtained by cross-country skiers Gunde Svan and Thomas Wassberg. Svan and Wassberg won the men's 15 km and 50 km, respectively, and also clinched the first place in the team relay. Svan was also awarded with a silver and bronze medals, thus contributing half of his NOC's medal tally. For the third consecutive Winter Olympics, Great Britain's sole medal was a gold at a figure skating event, this time in ice dancing by Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, who received the first-ever set of perfect scores in their free program routine.

She originally performed on Broadway, and was then signed to a film contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She appeared in several musical films, then returned to Broadway and made guest appearances on several television series. Garrett later became known for the roles she played in two prominent 1970s sitcoms: Archie Bunker's politically-liberal neighbor Irene Lorenzo in All in the Family and landlady Edna Babish in Laverne & Shirley. In later years, she appeared in television series such as The Golden Girls, Grey's Anatomy, Boston Public and Becker as well as in several Broadway plays and revivals. Early life Garrett was born in Saint Joseph, Missouri, the daughter of Elizabeth Octavia (n√©e Stone) and Curtis Garrett.Betty Garrett Biography (1919-) Shortly after her birth, her parents relocated to Seattle, Washington, where her mother managed the sheet music department at Sherman Clay, and her father worked as a traveling salesman. His alcoholism and fiscal irresponsibility eventually led to their divorce, and Garrett and her mother lived in a series of residential hotels in order to minimize expenses. When Garrett was eight years old, her mother married the fianc√© she had jilted in order to marry Curtis. They settled in Regina, Saskatchewan, where her new stepfather worked in the meat-packing industry. A year later. her mother discovered that her new husband was involved in a sexual relationship with his male assistant, so she and Betty returned to Seattle. After graduating from public grammar school, Garrett enrolled at the Annie Wright School in Tacoma, which she attended on a full scholarship. The school had no drama department, so she frequently organized musical productions and plays for special occasions. Following her senior year performance in Twelfth Night, the bishop urged her to pursue a career on the stage. At the same time, her mother's friend arranged an interview with Martha Graham, who was in Seattle for a concert tour, and the dancer recommended her for a scholarship at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. Garrett and her mother arrived in Manhattan in the summer of 1936 and Garrett began classes in September. Her teachers included Graham and Anna Sokolow for dance, Sandy Meisner for drama, Lehman Engel for music, and Margaret Webster for the Shakespearean classics, and fellow students included Daniel Mann and Richard Conte. She felt she was destined to be a dramatic actress and shied away from playing comedic roles. Early career During the summer months, Garrett performed in the Borscht Belt, where she had the opportunity to work with Danny Kaye, Jerome Robbins, Carol Channing, Imogene Coca, and Jules Munshin, and she was encouraged to hone her singing and dancing skills. She joined Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre as an understudy in what was to be its last stage presentation, a poorly- reviewed and short-lived production of Danton's Death that gave her the opportunity to work with Joseph Cotten, Ruth Ford, Martin Gabel, and Arlene Francis. She performed with Martha Graham's dance company at Carnegie Hall and the Alvin Theatre, sang at the Village Vanguard, and appeared in satirical and political revues staged by the Brooklyn-based Flatbush Arts Theatre, which eventually changed its name to the American Youth Theatre and relocated to Manhattan. During this period she joined the Communist Party and began performing at fundraisers for progressive causes. =Broadway= Garrett made her Broadway debut in 1942 in the revue Of V We Sing, which closed after 76 performances but led to her being cast in the Harold Rome revue Let Freedom Sing later that year. It closed after only eight performances, but producer Mike Todd saw it and signed her to understudy Ethel Merman and play a small role in the 1943 Cole Porter musical Something for the Boys. Merman became ill during the run, allowing Garrett to play the lead for a week. During this time, she was seen by producer Vinton Freedley, who cast her in Jackpot, a Vernon Duke/Howard Dietz musical starring Nanette Fabray and Allan Jones. The show closed quickly, and Garrett began touring the country with her nightclub act. =Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer= After appearing on Broadway in Laffing Room Only, which closed there, Garrett traveled with the show as it played extended runs in Detroit and Chicago. After this, she returned to New York and was cast in Call Me Mister, which reunited her with Harold Rome, Lehman Engel, and Jules Munshin. She won critical acclaim and the Donaldson Award for her performance, which prompted Al Hirschfeld to caricature her in The New York Times. It led to her being signed to a one-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer by Louis B. Mayer. Garrett arrived at the studio in January 1947 and made her film debut portraying nightclub performer Shoo Shoo O'Grady in Big City, directed by Norman Taurog and co-starring George Murphy and Robert Preston. Mayer renewed her contract and she appeared in the musicals Words and Music, On the Town, Take Me Out To The Ball Game, and Neptune's Daughter in quick succession. The Jolson Story had been a huge hit in the United Kingdom, so Garrett and her husband Larry Parks decided to capitalize on its popularity by appearing at the London Palladium and then touring the U.K. with their nightclub act. Its success prompted them to return to the country three times but the increasing popularity of television eventually led to the decline of music hall entertainment. Garrett then was cast opposite Janet Leigh and Jack Lemmon in My Sister Eileen, a 1955 musical remake of a 1940 theatrical adaptation of stories by Ruth McKenney. Garrett got the part when Judy Holliday dropped out of the project due to a contract dispute. The following year, she and Parks replaced Holliday and Sydney Chaplin in the Broadway production of Bells Are Ringing during their vacation from the show. Over the next two decades. she worked sporadically, appearing on Broadway in two short- lived plays (Beg, Borrow or Steal with Parks and A Girl Could Get Lucky with Pat Hingle) and a musical adaptation of Spoon River Anthology, and making guest appearances on The Dinah Shore Chevy Show, The Lloyd Bridges Show, and The Fugitive. Later career In the fall of 1973, All in the Family added two new people to the neighborhood, Frank Lorenzo and his feisty Irish- American wife Irene. Lear had been the publicity man for Call Me Mister, All in the Family writers Bernard West and Mickey West knew Garrett from her time with the American Youth Theatre, and Jean Stapleton had been in the cast of Bells Are Ringing, so Garrett appeared to be a front runner for the role of Irene. It went instead to Sada Thompson, but Thompson, unhappy after taping one episode, asked to be released from her commitment, freeing the role for Garrett. Irene was Catholic‚Äîa source of annoyance for Protestant Archie‚Äîand assumed many of the household duties normally associated with husbands, and she therefore presented a kind of nemesis to Archie Bunker. She later worked with Archie at his place of employment, driving a forklift, and was paid less than the man she replaced (but more than Archie). Garrett remained with the series from 1973 through 1975. She won the 1974 Golden Globe for her performance on the series. The following year, Garrett was performing her one- woman show Betty Garrett and Other Songs in Westwood, California when she was offered the role of landlady Edna Babish in Laverne & Shirley. The character was a five-time divorc√©e who eventually married Laverne's father Frank. Although Garrett reportedly felt she never was given enough to do on the show, she appreciated the fact that her musical talents occasionally were incorporated into the plot. In 1981, when the series was extended beyond what had been intended to be its final season, Garrett was forced to drop out because she had committed to performing with Sandy Dennis, Jack Gilford, Hope Lange, and Joyce Van Patten in The Supporting Cast on Broadway. The play closed after only eight performances, but returning to Laverne & Shirley was not an option as the writers had explained Edna's disappearance by having her divorce Frank, although this was not directly addressed until the series' final season. In the ensuing years, Garrett appeared on television in Murder, She Wrote, The Golden Girls, Harts of the West, Union Square, Boston Public, Becker (for which she was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series), and Grey's Anatomy, and on stage in Plaza Suite (with Parks), And Miss Reardon Drinks A Little, Meet Me in St. Louis as Katie, the feisty Irish maid, and the 2001 Broadway revival of Follies, receiving excellent notices for singing \\"Broadway Baby.\\" At Theatre West, which she co- founded, she directed Arthur Miller's The Price and appeared in the play Waiting in the Wings. She won the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award twice, for Spoon River Anthology and Betty Garrett and Other Songs. Garrett received a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame in 2003. On the occasion of her 90th birthday in 2009, she was honored at a celebration sponsored by Theatre West at the Music Box Theatre in Hollywood.Los Angeles Times, May 27, 2009LA Weekly, June 1, 2009 In 2010, Garrett appeared alongside former two-time co- star Esther Williams during Turner Classic Movies' first annual Classic Film Festival.TCM News Release Their film Neptune's Daughter was screened at the pool of the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood, California, while a Williams- inspired synchronised swimming troupe, The Aqualilies, performed.Review of the TCM Classic Film Festival Awards and nominations Golden Globes * 1974: Won for Best Supporting Actress for the role of Irene Lorenzo in the television series All in the Family.

It was there where she met Larry Parks, who was producing the show. He invited her to join him for a drink, then drove her to the top of Mulholland Drive and told her \\"You're the girl I'm going to marry.\\" During the next two weeks, the two were inseparable. Garrett departed for a nightclub engagement in Chicago. Eventually Parks joined her and introduced her to his mother, who lived in nearby Joliet, Illinois. Parks returned to Los Angeles to begin filming Counter-Attack, and Garrett traveled to New York to prepare for Laffing Room Only with Olsen and Johnson, but before rehearsals began, she called Parks and proposed marriage. The two were wed on September 8, 1944, four months after their initial meeting. Actor Lloyd Bridges served as best man. Garrett and Parks spent a month honeymooning in Malibu Beach, and they then lived apart for the next two years while pursuing their careers. A Democrat, she supported Adlai Stevenson's campaign in the 1952 presidential election.Motion Picture and Television Magazine, November 1952, page 33, Ideal Publishers Garrett and Parks remained married until his death in 1975. They had two sons, composer Garrett Parks and actor Andrew Parks. Betty Garrett had one granddaughter, Madison Claire Parks, by her son Garrett Parks, and daughter-in-law, Broadway actress Karen Culliver. Blacklisting Because of their past affiliations with the Communist Party, Garrett and Parks became embroiled with the House Un-American Activities Committee, although only Parks was forced to testify. He willingly admitted that he had been a member of the party and initially refused to name others, but he later did so. Despite this, he found himself on the Hollywood blacklist. Garrett also had trouble finding work, but as the mother of two young sons, she did not mind being unemployed as much as her husband did. Parks formed a highly successful construction business, and eventually the couple owned many apartment buildings scattered throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Rather than sell them upon completion, Parks decided to retain ownership and collect rents as a landlord, a decision that proved to be extremely profitable. During this period, the couple occasionally performed in Las Vegas showrooms, summer stock productions, and touring companies of Broadway shows. Death Garrett died of an aortic aneurysm in Los Angeles on February 12, 2011 at the age of 91. Her body was cremated.

She has voiced the character Norma Bindlebeep on the Nick at Nite animated series Fatherhood, a show based on Bill Cosby's book of the same name. Early Life Sabrina was born on March 21, 1958 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Eager to leave the strictly segregated lifestyle of 1950s Louisiana behind, her family moved to Los Angeles, California soon after her birth. Her parents divorced, and Sabrina lived with her maternal grandmother, Sce Ethel Holmes, in south central LA until her mother's remarriage. When Sabrina was 10 years old, she returned to live with her mother and stepfather in Inglewood, California. Acting interested her from a young age, and she performed in many school plays, starring as Cinderella in elementary school. Sabrina also took on leadership roles, including high school class president at St. Matthias Catholic Girls High School and a Girls' State delegate. After high school Sabrina attended UCLA, earning her undergraduate degree in theater. During her time at UCLA she became frustrated by the lack of parts offered to African American students, and in response formed a black students' theater group to allow them to put on their own shows. In September 1980 she began graduate work at the Yale School of Drama, where she earned her master's degree in acting. Career In 1984, Le Beauf auditioned for the role of the eldest Huxtable daughter Sondra on The Cosby Show. 26 years old at the time of her audition, she was initially considered too old to play one of the children, being only 10 years younger than Phylicia Rashad, the actress who played her mother, Clair Huxtable. Pop singer Whitney Houston also auditioned for the same part, but Le Beauf's theater experience won her the role. Sabrina went on to play Sondra Huxtable for all eight seasons of The Cosby Show, from 1984 through the series' end in 1992. Sondra, a Princeton graduate that went on to marry and start a family of her own, was a popular character on the show; in 1988, 50 million viewers turned in to watch Sondra give birth to twins, named Winnie and Nelson in honor of Nelson Mandela and his wife. During her time on the Cosby Show, Le Beauf also appeared in the series ‚ÄúHotel‚Äù and the TV movie ‚ÄúHoward Beach: Making a Case for Murder.\\" She also had brief appearances as bridge officer Ensign Giusti on two episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation and on the comedy The Sinbad Show. Le Beauf also continued her work in the theater, starring as Rosalind in a production of Shakespeare's \\"As You Like It.\\" Currently, Le Beauf is a frequent leading lady performing with the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. She recently portrayed Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew with the Company in D.C. Le Beauf also appeared in the off-broadway play ‚ÄúLOVE, LOSS AND WHAT I WORE‚Äù that ran from 2009 to 2012. Personal life While performing at the Folger Theater in Washington , Le Beauf met businessman and producer Michael Reynolds in 1987. They married less than one month later, settling in New York. They remained married for over ten years but filed for divorce in 1997, which Le Beauf described as \\"a mutual decision.\\" Filmography *The Cosby Show (1984‚Äì1992) *Hotel (1986) *Howard Beach: Making A Case For Murder(1989) *Star Trek: The Next Generation, episode \\"Gambit, Parts I & II\\" (1993) *The Sinbad Show (1994) *Cosby (1999) *Fatherhood (2004) *The Stalker Within (1999) Awards and nominations *Young Artist Awards 1989: Best Young Actor/Actress Ensemble in a Television Comedy, Drama Series or Special The Cosby Show References External links * Category:Actresses from Louisiana Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:Yale School of Drama alumni Category:Louisiana Creole people Category:American interior designers Category:American voice actresses Category:People from Downey, California Category:American television actresses Category:African-American actresses Category:American stage actresses Category:American women interior designers ","title":"Sabrina Le Beauf"},{"id":"921347","title":"Garry Monahan"},{"id":"921348","text":"Pok√©mon Puzzle Challenge is a video game for the Game Boy Color. It is based on Panel de Pon, only with characters from the Pok√©mon franchise. The characters in Pok√©mon Puzzle Challenge are based on those in the Gold and Silver games, while those in Pok√©mon Puzzle League‚Äîits Nintendo 64 equivalent‚Äîwere based more on the anime characters. However, the game is also focused around beating the Johto leaders in a puzzle challenge in Johto region. The game play mode is divided into 1 Player, 2 Player, and Training. The game was later released on the 3DS eShop on November 6, 2014. Gameplay Gameplay of Pok√©mon Puzzle Challenge currently showing Marathon. Pok√©mon Puzzle Challenge features Pok√©mon characters in a version of Panel de Pon. Panel de Pon featured unique characters for both player-characters and opponents; similarly, Pok√©mon such as Pikachu, Pichu, Cyndaquil, Totodile, and Chikorita appear as playable heroes, while Gym Leaders, trainers, and the Elite Four from Pok√©mon Gold and Silver appear as opponents, all of them utilizing a single Pok√©mon used in Gold and Silver. It features the ability to collect Pok√©mon by battling certain trainers in order to unlock new and permanent Pok√©mon to play as; if one manages to achieve a certain prerequisite. Similarly, the music in the game was redone from the original Gold and Silver with new upbeat, yet familiar songs to complement the gameplay style. Players attempt to meet a goal, achieve a high score, or outlast opponents by preventing blocks from reaching the top of the player's playfield. The game has three modes of play ‚Äî single player, multi player, and training modes. There are also several other sub-modes: Marathon, Challenge, Time Zone, LineClear, Puzzle, and Garbage!. Marathon involves playing infinitely until players lose; Challenge is a versus computer or another player, involving forming combos to force the opposition to lose, though unlike other versions of the game, only the player's puzzle is visible, the opponent's replaced with a block meter (HP meter in 1P Challenge) indicating how close they are to losing; Time Zone involves forming a high enough score in a certain amount of time; LineClear involves clearing levels by reaching a certain number of lines; Puzzle involves clearing a select number of blocks in a certain number of turns; and Garbage! is similarly to Marathon in being infinite, except garbage blocks fall on players' field, making it more difficult. With the exception of Puzzle, reaching the top in any of these modes results in the mode ending. The gameplay is largely the same as in other games in the Puzzle League series; players control a two square long cursor that can swap or move blocks around the field. The objective is to clear blocks in at least three block clears or more, while players are encouraged to combo and/or chain. Combos are performed by clearing more than three blocks, and chains are performed when falling blocks from one clear cause another set of blocks to clear. In certain modes, combo and/or chain clears will cause objects called garbage blocks to fall on enemies' areas with intent of forcing them to reach the top, thereby ending the round in players' favour. Unlike its counterparts on other platforms, it uses a 6x9 puzzle grid which is smaller in size. Similarly, Tetris Attack and Kirby's Star Stacker for the Game Boy use the same size puzzle grid. Development Pok√©mon Puzzle Challenge was first announced in Nintendo employee Peter Main's \\"Industry Review\\" webcast under the title Pok√©mon Attack on January 13, 2000. It was developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo. Its name was eventually changed to Pok√©mon Puzzle League, similar to the Nintendo 64 video game. It was eventually released as Pok√©mon Puzzle Challenge. The delay was explained as being due to the release of Pok√©mon Gold and Silver, believing them to be enough to appease fans. A screensaver was released by Nintendo to promote the game. It was released in Japan on September 21, 2000, December 4, 2000 in North America, and June 15, 2001 in PAL regions.  Reception  =Pre-release reception= When it was first announced, few details were revealed. Upon hearing about it, IGN theorized that it was an Americanized version of Puyo Puyo Sun with Pok√©mon characters, similar to how Kirby's Avalanche was a localization of Puyo Puyo. In a preview, IGN praised Pok√©mon Puzzle Challenge for its gameplay, calling them \\"nice and simple to appeal to players of all ages and levels\\". In another preview, they comment that this idea was a great one to get kids to \\"stare at even more Pokemon images for even more hours on end\\". =Critical reception= Since its release, Pok√©mon Puzzle Challenge has received highly positive reception. It holds an aggregate score of 90.20% at GameRankings, making it the 10th best Game Boy Color game and the 300th best video game on Game Rankings. Nintendo Power gave it a perfect score, while Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it a nine out of 10. Nintendo Power nominated it for \\"best puzzle game\\" and \\"best Pok√©mon game\\". ultimately losing to Pok√©mon Puzzle League for the former category and Pok√©mon Gold and Silver for the latter. Nintendo Power also listed Pok√©mon Puzzle Challenge as the 13th best Game Boy/Game Boy Color video game, calling the gameplay only second in addictiveness to Tetris, ultimately giving the nod to this version of the gameplay over Tetris Attack because of a few extra features. Game Informers Ben Reeves called it the 12th best Game Boy game. He noted that it beat out Tetris Attack for this game's increased polish. Children's software & new media revue: Volume 9 called it \\"addictive\\", commenting that those who were not interested in the series would be fine, commenting that it \\"holds little similarity\\" to the Pok√©mon franchise. IGN editor Craig Harris called the return of the Tetris Attack gameplay \\"welcome\\", commenting that it was \\"as fun and addictive as it ever was\\". However, he criticized its lack of a Puzzle Edit mode, a mode found in the Nintendo 64 counterpart game Pok√©mon Puzzle League. He awarded it the Editor's Choice award. In a Pok√©mon video game retrospective, fellow IGN editor Lucas M. Thomas commented that while it didn't bring anything new to the Tetris Attack gameplay, it being in a \\"new, Colorized portable version was enough\\". GameSpot editor Frank Provo commented that it \\"does the Pok√©mon license proud\\", calling it both \\"addictive\\" and praising its overall value. GamePro gave it 4.5 stars out of five, awarding it their Editor's Choice award. William Schiffmann of The Associated Press commented that while it doesn't \\"break any new ground\\" and the Pok√©mon theme constitutes a \\"sales gimmick\\", fans of Tetris would enjoy it.

Norway topped the table, collecting seventeen medals in total, including four gold, three of which were won by Thorleif Haug in the Nordic combined and cross-country skiing events. Norway also achieved two podium sweeps, winning all three medals in both the 50 km cross-country skiing and the Nordic combined. This remained a record at the Winter Olympics until 2014. When it was held, the games were not formally recognised as being the Olympics, but acknowledged that they were held under the \\"high patronage of the International Olympic Committee\\". Partly due to this, varying figures are reported for the number of participants. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) website suggests that 258 athletes from 16 nations participated in 16 events across 9 sports. In contrast, the Sports-Reference website lists 313 participants from 19 countries. Bill Mallon, a prominent Olympic Games historian, quotes a figure of 291 competitors in his Historical Dictionary of the Olympic Movement. Meanwhile, the official report for the 1924 Summer and Winter Olympics listed 293 athletes from 17 nations. Finland placed second on the table, collecting four gold medals amongst a total of eleven. Clas Thunberg won five of their medals, achieving a medal in each of the speed skating events he took part in; collecting three gold medals, one silver and one bronze. Eight of the competing nations achieved at least one gold medal, with only Belgium and the hosts, France, medalling without winning a gold medal. One medal was reallocated in 1974; during the games, Thorleif Haug of Norway had been awarded the bronze medal in ski jumping, along with his three gold medals. A Norwegian historian discovered that there had been a scoring error, and an American, Anders Haugen, had actually finished in third place. As Haug had died in 1934, his daughter presented Haugen, aged 83, with his medal. In the official report, the classification of nations is ranked not by medals, but rather by \\"points\\", which were awarded for each position from first to sixth; not exclusively for gold, silver and bronze. Due to this, Czechoslovakia were included in the table ahead of Belgium, due to two fourth-place finishes, one fifth and one sixth. Italy were also present, in twelfth, for their solitary sixth place. Medal table alt=A signed black and white photograph of Clas Thunberg skating The medal table is based on information provided by the IOC and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. Two bronze medals were awarded in the 500 metres speed skating event for the third place tie.

Early life and education The Varvatos family is originally from the village of Poulata on the island of Kefalonia, Greece. Varvatos was born in Detroit and grew up in Allen Park, Michigan. He attended Allen Park High School. At the age of 16, he got a job selling menswear at the Hughes & Hatcher store in nearby Dearborn. He attended Eastern Michigan University and the University of Michigan. Early career After graduating in 1980, he co-founded a menswear store, Fitzgerald's Men's Store, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Varvatos joined Polo Ralph Lauren in 1983. He then moved on to Calvin Klein in 1990 where he was appointed head of menswear design and oversaw the launch of the men's collection and the cK brand. During his time at Calvin Klein, Varvatos pioneered a type of men's undergarment called boxer briefs, a hybrid of boxer shorts and briefs. Made famous by a series of 1992 print ads featuring Mark Wahlberg, they have been called \\"one of the greatest apparel revolutions of the century.\\" Of their creation Varvatos said in 2010, \\"We just cut off a pair of long johns and thought, this could be cool ...\\". In 1995, Varvatos returned to Ralph Lauren as head of menswear design for all Polo Ralph Lauren brands and created the Polo Jeans Company. Career In late 1999, Varvatos started his company, debuting his first clothing line at the end of 2000 in New York. The brand now includes belts, handbags, footwear, eyewear, watches and fragrances. In September 2000, within months of showing his first collection, Varvatos opened a freestanding boutique in SoHo. The collection is currently distributed in John Varvatos boutiques including the 315 Bowery boutique in the space that formerly housed the underground music club CBGB. 2009 saw the launch of New York Nights‚Ä¶Direct From the Bowery, a monthly radio show hosted by Varvatos on Sirius XM's The Spectrum channel. The show includes songs and interviews from various artists who have influenced Varvatos throughout his career in fashion. In 2012, Varvatos joined the cast of celebrity mentors on NBC's Fashion Star, a reality competition series that searched for the next big brand in fashion. In 2013, he saw the release of a limited edition Chrysler 300 in his name. In 2014, he partnered with Monte Lipman's Republic label to launch John Varvatos Records, initially signing the Zac Brown Band. Varvatos credits his early obsession with rock 'n' roll as the catalyst for his interest in fashion. The ad campaigns for the main collection, shot by Danny Clinch, have featured such musicians and bands such as Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper, Velvet Revolver, Chris Cornell, Dave Matthews, The Roots, and Green Day. John Varvatos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May of 2020. Philanthropy Music is also central to the brand's philanthropic efforts, including the Save the Music Foundation and an annual Stuart House benefit. In July 2014 it was announced that Ringo Starr would be modelling for the fall/winter advertising campaign, and that an associated charitable initiative would benefit The Ringo Starr Peace and Love Fund, in aid of the David Lynch Foundation. Commenting, Varvatos said, \\"Both inner peace and global peace are very important topics to me\\". Partnership with Converse In 2001, Varvatos and Converse formed a partnership and Varvatos was licensed to create a line of high end sneakers, John Varvatos' sneakers were usually produced in the style of High Top Chuck Taylor All-Stars. The partnership has since ended, and Varvatos now produces a Bootleg brand show line in a similar Chuck Taylor style. Awards Varvatos had first received accolades from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) in 2000 when he was honored with the Perry Ellis Award for Menswear. The following year he won the 2001 CFDA's Designer of the Year award. In 2005, Varvatos received the CFDA's 2005 Menswear Designer of the Year award at the New York Public Library. The recipients are determined by a selection committee of top magazine editors, journalists, stylists and retailers from around the world. He competed for the top honor along with Ralph Lauren and John Bartlett for his third CFDA win. In 2007, Varvatos was named GQs Designer of the Year.

History The first Wienerschnitzel was founded by former Taco Bell employee John Galardi (1937-2013). When Galardi came to California at the age of 19, he landed his first job from Glen Bell, who would go on to later establish Taco Bell in 1962. Bell initially hired him on a part-time basis for 50 cents an hour at a taco store called Taco-Tia. Eventually, Galardi entered into a partnership agreement to run the store. At one point, Bell borrowed $6,000 from Galardi, but was unable to pay the loan back. He offered to sell the store to Galardi for $12,000. Galardi borrowed some money from his parents, laid off all of the employees at the restaurant and worked alone, and eventually secured enough money to purchase the store. A couple of years later, a man wanted to recruit Galardi to start his own restaurant at a location on Pacific Coast Highway in Wilmington, next to one of Bell's taco stores. Bell encouraged him to take the man up on the offer, but to sell another kind of food. Galardi decided to sell hot dogs since \\"nobody else was in hot dogs.\\" According to Galardi, his wife came up with the name when looking through a cookbook. He was initially skeptical of the name, saying, \\"I told my wife going home nobody in their right mind would call a company wienerschnitzel. Three days later, I said, 'Hell, it's better than John's Hot Dogs.'\\" (Orange County Business Journal. \\"Wienerschnitzel's John Galardi - No Ordinary Hot Dog\\". March 30, 1987) The first location was opened in 1961 as a hot-dog stand at 900 West Pacific Coast Highway, east of Figueroa Street, in the Los Angeles community of Wilmington. In the late 1980's, Galardi converted several stores in the Denver area and other Western cities into The Original Hamburger Stand restaurants. Wienerschnitzels now sell Tastee-Freez ice cream, a brand also owned by Galardi. John Galardi died of pancreatic cancer on April 13, 2013. His ex-wife, Cynthia Galardi-Culpepper, who previously was a silent partner, assumed the role as CEO and chairwoman after his passing. She was the first and only woman in a corporate managerial position, and had appeared as an Undercover Boss. in 2016. In 2015, the company signed a franchise agreement with International Food Concepts Inc. to plan and open Wienerschnitzel locations in Panama.

The expression Wienerschnitzel is German, spelled as a one-word compound as was the standard before the spelling reform of 1996 and is still the standard in Switzerland;Duden. Schweizer Hochdeutsch. Bibliographisches Institut. Mannheim: 2012. Page 85. however, the correct article to use in this case is the neuter form das,\\"Schnitzel\\" Duden online. http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Schnitzel not the masculine der. This is true for both the actual food (das Schnitzel) and the restaurant itself (das Restaurant, das Lokal). In English, \\"wiener\\" (short for \\"wienerwurst\\"), from Wiener W√ºrstchen, is a colloquial name for a hot dog.\\"wiener\\". Webster's online dictionary. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wiener The actual Wiener Schnitzel, however, means \\"Viennese breaded veal cutlet\\", something the restaurant chain has only served briefly as a limited menu item (in 2017). https://www.nrn.com/food-trends/wienerschnitzel-finally-lives-its-name The chain changed its name to \\"Wienerschnitzel\\" (sans article) in 1977, though many franchises retained the older name on their restaurants and many older customers still refer to the chain as \\"Der Wienerschnitzel\\". The restaurant paid homage to its original name in its 2009 marketing slogan, \\"DERlicious\\". Logo, slogans, and advertising Soon after the name change, the current Wienerschnitzel \\"W\\" logo was created by graphic designer Saul Bass in 1978. The Delicious One (sometimes referred to as TDO), Wienerschnitzel's mascot, has been featured in some advertising since 1999. The slogan, \\"The World's Most Wanted Wiener\\" is used in all of The Delicious One's commercials. The new commercials are more focused on describing their food products and are produced in live action. Wienerschnitzel uses the slogan \\"DERlicious\\" in advertising, relating to before the company dropped the \\"Der\\" from its name in 1977. Some other newer commercials use the slogan, \\"Hot Dogs are DER again!\\" along with the DERlicious logo. In celebration of Wienerschnitzel's 50th anniversary, a new slogan was released in 2011 to continue the \\"Der\\" theme: \\"Der fun since '61!\\".

It is approximately 28 miles (45 km) in length. The river is a County Biological Heritage Site and has a sheltered estuary which, from its northwest corner, penetrates deep into the almost square peninsula of the Fylde. Etymology The name Wyre is of pre-Roman, likely if specific, Common Brittonic origin. It may be derived from *wiŒ£-, a form of the element *wei, with a basic sense of \\"flowing\\", with the suffix ‚ÄìurƒÅ. The River Wyre possibly shares its etymology with other river names, including the Wear in County Durham and the Quair Water in Scotland. Geography The Wyre near St Michael's On Wyre The river rises in the Forest of Bowland in central Lancashire, as two distinct tributaries, the Tarnbrook Wyre and the Marshaw Wyre, whose confluence is near the village of Abbeystead. In 1984 a pumping station, built just below the confluence as part of a water transfer scheme in the 1980s, saw the Abbeystead disaster, an explosion in which 16 people were killed and a further 22 were injured. From Abbeystead, the river flows south through Dolphinholme to Garstang, where the Lancaster Canal crosses on a small aqueduct. One mile south, at Catterall, it meets its first major tributary, the River Calder. The river then turns westwards, flowing through St Michael's On Wyre where it is joined by its second major tributary, the River Brock. It becomes tidal below the weir at St Michael's. It is crossed by a toll bridge (normal fee is 50 pence) at Cartford, between Little Eccleston and Out Rawcliffe. A former toll bridge, Shard Bridge, close to Poulton-le-Fylde, has been rebuilt and is now free. A pedestrian ferry runs between Fleetwood and Knott End but the ferry to the Isle of Man no longer runs. Major industry existed at the former ICI site at Burn Naze, close to the estuary of the river. It was originally an alkali works taking brine from mines and wells across the river in and around Preesall. Later processes undertaken on the site included those dealing with vinyl chloride monomer, although this was later moved to Runcorn and ICI activity on the site ceased. Industrial activity by a number of various companies continues by the river, albeit on a much reduced scale. The area around Burn Naze on the western side of the Wyre Estuary was formerly known as Bergerode, believed to be an Old English term for \\"shallow harbour\\", beor grade.William John Thomas et al., Notes and Queries (1850). Oxford University Press. From Skippool, just downstream of Shard Bridge, to Fleetwood, the banks of the river form the Wyre Estuary Country Park. Facilities exist on the western bank. The park has its headquarters at Stanah. It has been the recipient of a Green Flag Award. Fleetwood at the mouth of the river was a major fishing port up until the latter part of the 20th century. Wyre Dock was built there between 1869 and 1877. With the decline in the size of the fleet, most of the dock complex has subsequently been converted to a marina and the adjacent \\"Freeport\\" shopping village. The river drains a total catchment area of approximately 175 square miles (450 km¬≤). The tidal portion of the river below Cartford Bridge drains a catchment area of approximately . The Wyre is the only one of the major Lancashire rivers that flows wholly within Lancashire; the Ribble starts in Yorkshire, and the Lune starts in Cumbria. The river's name possibly means 'winding river' in Celtic.

It is a standing group of 60 eminent jurists‚Äîincluding senior judges, attorneys and academics‚Äîwho work to develop national and international human rights standards through the law. Commissioners are known for their experience, knowledge and fundamental commitment to human rights. The composition of the Commission aims to reflect the geographical diversity of the world and its many legal systems. The Commission is supported by an International Secretariat based in Geneva, Switzerland, and staffed by lawyers drawn from a wide range of jurisdictions and legal traditions. The Secretariat and the Commission undertake advocacy and policy work aimed at strengthening the role of lawyers and judges in protecting and promoting human rights and the rule of law. In addition, the ICJ has national sections and affiliates in over 70 countries. Given the legal focus of the ICJ's work, membership of these sections is predominantly drawn from the legal profession. In April 2013, the ICJ was presented with the Light of Truth Award by the Dalai Lama and the International Campaign for Tibet. The award is presented to organisations who have made outstanding contributions to the Tibetan cause. The current ICJ President is Professor Robert Goldman. Former Presidents include Sir Nigel Rodley (2012-2017), a former member of the UN Human Rights Committee, Professor Pedro Nikken (2011-2012) and Mary Robinson (2008-2011), the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and President of Ireland.  Current activities  The ICJ is active in promoting human rights and the rule of law, whether at the international level (e.g. the UN), regionally (e.g. the EU and Council of Europe), or domestically through the activities of its national sections (e.g. JUSTICE in the UK). The ICJ's International Law and Protection Programme works to promote the application of international law to violations of a civil, political, social or economic nature.\\"Themes\\" at icj.org Accessed 17 September 2017 The focus is on the international obligations of states to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights through the Rule of Law, to protect victims of human rights violations, and to hold states and non-state actors accountable for these violations and abuses. Today, the specific areas of work include: * Centre for the Independence of Judges and Lawyers (CIJL); * Economic, social and cultural rights; * Business and Human Rights; * Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity; * Women‚Äôs Human Rights; * United Nations Human Rights Mechanisms; and * Global Security and the Rule of Law. The ICJ also operates regional programmes of work in Africa, Asia Pacific, Central America, Europe, and the Middle East and North Africa.\\"Regions\\" at icj.org Accessed 17 September 2017 These focus on promoting and supporting the independence of the judiciary, the Rule of Law and human rights issues specific to their regional contexts. To support this work, the ICJ has regional offices in Thailand, South Africa, and Guatemala, and country office in Nepal and North Africa.  History  Born at the ideological frontline of a divided post-war Berlin, the ICJ was established following the 1952 ‚ÄòInternational Congress of Jurists‚Äô in West Berlin . The Congress was organized by the ‚ÄòInvestigating Committee of Free Jurists (ICJF)‚Äô, a group of German jurists committed to investigating human rights abuses carried out in the Soviet Zone of post-war Germany. During the Congress, delegates decided to make provisions to expand the work of the ICJF to investigate human rights violations in other regions of the world. A five- member ‚ÄòStanding Committee of the Congress‚Äô was appointed for this purpose and, in 1953, the Standing Committee created the ‚ÄúInternational Commission of Jurists (ICJ)‚Äù as a permanent organisation dedicated to the defence of human rights through the rule of law. One of the key areas of concern for the 106 Congress delegates was the case of Dr. Walter Linse, a West German lawyer and the Acting President of the ICJF. Two weeks prior to the start of the Congress, on 8 July 1952, in an apparent attempt to intimidate participants, Dr. Linse was abducted by East German intelligence agents and delivered to the KGB. Despite international condemnation of the abduction, Dr. Linse was executed in Moscow for ‚Äúespionage‚Äù in 1953. The ICJ was initially partially funded by the Central Intelligence Agency through the American Fund for Free Jurists, but the CIA's role was not known to most of the ICJ's members. American founders like Allen Dulles and John J. McCloy conceived it as a counter to the International Association of Democratic Lawyers controlled by the Soviet Union. Ex-CIA officer Philip Agee considered that the ICJ was \\"set up and controlled by the CIA for propaganda operations.\\"Philip Agee, Inside the Company: CIA Diary, Allen Lane, 1975, p 611. The CIA funding became public in 1967, but the organization survived the revelations after a period of reform under Secretary General Sean MacBride, and through Ford Foundation funding. From 1970 to 1990, Niall MacDermot was Secretary-General, succeeding Sean MacBride. MacDermot moved the ICJ away from its association with the CIA, to the forefront of the international human rights movement.Iain Guest, Behind the disappearances: Argentina's dirty war against human rights and the United Nations, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1990, , p 111. In 1978, the ICJ established the Centre for the Independence of Judges and Lawyers (CIJL). It was instrumental in the formulation and adoption of the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary and the UN Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers and its mandate is to work for their implementation. In 1980, the ICJ received the European Human Rights Prize by Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. In 1986, the ICJ gathered a group of distinguished experts in international law to consider the nature and scope of the obligations of States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The meeting witnessed the birth of the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which continue to guide international law in the area of economic, social and cultural rights. In the 1990s, a number of important international developments took place as a result of initiatives by the ICJ. These included the UN Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the recommendation by the Programme of Action of the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna to work on the setting up of an International Criminal Court. This was the direct result of an international conference on impunity, organised by the ICJ under the auspices of the United Nations in 1992, which adopted an appeal asking the Vienna conference to \\"set up an international penal tribunal‚Ä¶in order to finally break the cycle of impunity\\". In November 2006 the ICJ held an international meeting in Yogyakarta for LGBT rights and published The Yogyakarta Principles in March 2007. The ICJ also initiated the drafting of the set of Principles for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights through Action to Combat Impunity and the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Violations of International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law, both under examination at the UN Human Rights Commission and also received the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights in 1993.

It is one of 12 pillboxes built as part of the 1945 Festung. In the German language, Festung Warschau (\\"Fortress Warsaw\\") is the term used to refer to a fortified and well-defended Warsaw. In the 20th century, the term was in use on three occasions during World War I and World War II. It was used when the Germans threw back the Russian advance in 1914, where Warsaw came within distance of the fighting in October. The term resurfaced during the September 1939 German invasion of Poland. Later in the second war, the term resurfaced between September 1944 and January 1945, when the retreating Germans tried to establish a defense in the city against the advancing Soviet Union. 1939 During the invasion of Poland in 1939 the German troops reached the outskirts of Warsaw on 9 September. The Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) assumed that the unfortified city damaged by countless terror bombing raids would be taken by German motorized units without any resistance and issued a press and radio release stating that the capital of Poland was taken. However, the German motorized assault was defeated and the advancing troops were forced to retreat with heavy casualties. From 8 September the city started to be referred to as Fortress of Warsaw in German broadcasts, which was to justify the aerial bombardment of civilian targets. The forces of the defenders, composed initially of only several battalions and various units of second-line troops, were soon strengthened by the soldiers of the Armies Pozna≈Ñ and Pomorze that reached the city in the aftermath of the Battle of Bzura. The Germans laid a siege to the city and started shelling it with heavy artillery located in the outskirts. However, the defending troops managed to defeat all assaults and until the end of September the Germans could not manage to break into the city. After three weeks of constant aerial and artillery bombardment and assaults, the situation of the civilian inhabitants of Warsaw became dire. Food, water and medicine shortages as well as the Luftwaffe strafing inhabitants and refugees grouped within the city caused Warsaw's civilian authorities to request a cease-fire. Warsaw President Stefan Starzy≈Ñski and Gen. Walerian Czuma, commander of the Warsaw garrison, decided that further resistance, although possible, would only expose the civilians to unnecessary hardship and signed the capitulation on 28 September 1939. The German text of the capitulation treaty as well as German propaganda used the term Festung Warschau to suggest that the failures of the Wehrmacht were due to heavily fortified terrain they had to cross. Warsaw, as a former Russian fortress, had several older fortifications, e.g. a ring of forts round the city and a citadel, built between 1835 and 1905. But those fortifications failed to prevent the city from being overrun in World War I, as Warsaw was occupied by German and Austro-Hungarian troops in 1915. 1944 By 1944, the German Eastern Front's situation became hopeless. Adolf Hitler who took over personally many duties in the OKW and OKH ordered the no step back policy in an attempt to halt the Soviet offensives which could not be contained by open field battle anymore. Following this policy, several cities were declared Festungen (Fortresses) and were to be held by the German army at all costs, even if surrounded and with no hope to break the siege. Examples of this policy were the Festung Stalingrad and Festung Kiev. Later in the war, the \\"Festung\\" concept that was to be illustrated by the propaganda film Kolberg which reminds of Kolberg's defense against Napoleon in 1807, was also applied to German cities like K√∂nigsberg, Breslau, Frankfurt (Oder) and Berlin. Often even the civil population was supposed to support the rather suicidal attempts of defense, as the cities were largely destroyed in the course of the fights. On 27 July 1944 Adolf Hitler ordered the Festung Warschau to be created and defended at all cost. The same day the governor of the General Government, Hans Frank, called for 100,000 Polish men between the ages of 17‚Äì65 to arrive at several gathering places in Warsaw the following day. They were to be employed at construction of fortifications for the Wehrmacht in and around the city. This move was viewed by the Armia Krajowa as an attempt to neutralize the underground forces, and the underground urged Warsaw inhabitants to ignore it. Fearing that the city would be turned into ruins and share the fate of Stalingrad and Kiev, General Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski ordered Operation Tempest to be started in Warsaw, which resulted in the Warsaw Uprising that lasted from August through September. After the Uprising, during which the Soviets troops had arrived near the Vistula, the Germans razed the city to the ground and continued the construction of concrete bunkers that were to defend Festung Warschau against the Red Army for four months. However, when the Soviets finally crossed the Vistula on 17 January 1945, the city was captured in several hours with little resistance from the remaining German garrison. The Chief of the Operational Branch of the German Army General Staff (Generalstab des Heeres), Colonel Bogislaw von Bonin, gave permission to the retreat of German Heeresgruppe A from Warsaw on 16 January 1945, throughout the Soviet Vistula-Oder Offensive and was imprisoned on 19 January 1945 by the Gestapo at Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp and Dachau concentration camp as he rejected a direct command of Adolf Hitler by this action.

Note: North is to upper-right. The All-American Canal is an 80-mile (130 km) long aqueduct, located in southeastern California. It conveys water from the Colorado River into the Imperial Valley and to nine cities. It is the Imperial Valley's only water source, and replaced the Alamo Canal, which was located mostly in Mexico. The Imperial Dam, about 30 miles (48 km) northeast of Yuma, Arizona on the Colorado River, diverts water into the All- American Canal, which runs to just west of Calexico, California before its last branch heads mostly north into the Imperial Valley. Five smaller canals branching off the All American Canal move water into the Imperial Valley. These canal systems irrigate up to 630,000 acres (250,000 ha) of crop land and have made possible a greatly increased crop yield in this area, originally one of the driest on earth. It is the largest irrigation canal in the world, carrying a maximum of 26,155 cubic feet per second (740.6 m3/s). Agricultural runoff from the All American Canal drains into the Salton Sea. The All American Canal runs parallel to the Mexico California border for several miles. With over 500 people having drowned in the canal since its completion, it has been called \\"the Most Dangerous Body of Water in the U.S.\\" The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued an advisory for any fish caught in the All-American Canal due to elevated levels of mercury, PCBs, and selenium. History Map showing the All-American Canal (yellow) The All-American Canal was authorized along with the Hoover Dam by the 1928 Boulder Canyon Project Act and built in the 1930s by the United States Bureau of Reclamation and Six Companies, Inc.. Its design and construction was supervised by the Bureau's then chief designing engineer, John L. Savage and was completed in 1942.http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/jsavage.pdf John Lucian Savage Biography by Abel Wolman & W. H. Lyles, National Academy of Science, 1978. Operations Imperial Valley Algodones Road = Irrigation = The Bureau of Reclamation owns the canal, but the Imperial Irrigation District operates it. Water for the canal is diverted at the Imperial Diversion Dam. The All- American Canal feeds, from east to west, the Coachella Canal, East Highline Canal, Central Main Canal, and the Westside Main Canal. These five main branches of the canal and a network of smaller canals gradually reduce the flow of the All-American Canal until it ends at a small drop in the western Imperial Valley where it drains into the Westside Main Canal. The main canal is , with a total drop of , a width of to and a depth of to . The canals get smaller as they run west because they carry less water. = Power = Eight hydroelectric power plants have been constructed along drops in the All- American Canal system. Drops 1 through 5, Pilot Knob, East Highline and Double Weir are located on the All-American Canal. Another power plant, Turnip, is located on the Central Main Canal branch. The power plants are all relatively small and have a combined capacity of 58 MW. Electricity generation is dictated by water delivery needs. There is also a 7.2 MW pumped storage plant at Senator Wash Dam. Water from the Senator Wash Reservoir is released when water needs exceed flows at Parker Dam. = Runoff = Runoff from the farmland irrigated by the All-American Canal make up most of the flows in the Alamo River and New River, both of which drain into the Salton Sea, now providing most of its water.http://www.saltonsea.ca.gov/about/about.htm Salton Sea Authority  The Sea's Vital Statistics The rest is from smaller rivers and drainage systems. Historically, the Salton Sea had been periodically flooded by extreme Colorado River floods and usually dried up before being reflooded. If not for the All-American Canal, the Salton Sea would have likely dried up long ago. The system transports silt, selenium and salts from the Colorado River into the Salton Sea. Because there is no outlet to the ocean, these salts and minerals are concentrated by evaporation.http://www.saltonsea.ca.gov/about/myth.htm Salton Sea Authority  Myths and Realities The All-American Canal Lining Project Approximately was lost annually by seepage from the All-American Canal, especially from the point where the canal crosses the great Algodones Dune Field. About 90% of this seepage entered Mexico. At first this seepage caused widespread flooding, but Mexicali Valley residents and businesses built drainage and pumping systems to recover the seepage. Mexicali Valley agriculture became reliant upon this seepage for irrigation. As water use increased in both rural and urban areas, this seepage became an issue of concern. The All-American Canal Lining Project, a part of California's Colorado River Water Use Plan, lined of the canal to prevent seepage.All-American Canal, California-Mexico border Portions of the public domain text of this US government article have been incorporated into this article. In 2006, a Mexicali business and civic organization and two California environmental non-profits challenged the lining project in US federal court on the basis that it violated the water rights of Mexican water users and violated US environmental statutes due to the seepage's effects on the nearby Andrade Mesa Wetlands. A rider in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 required the completion of the lining project, however, and the lawsuit was rendered moot. The Imperial Irrigation District built a parallel canal along the designated section of the original canal, and the water flow was rerouted into the new lined canal. Construction began in 2007 and was completed in 2009. Drowning deaths Over 500 people have drowned in the All-American Canal since its completion due to deep, cold water, steep sides that make escape difficult, and swift currents that can reach 5.45 mph (8.8 km/h). Many of those killed are immigrants traveling across the U.S.-Mexico border. Deaths peaked at 31 in 1998 after increased border security measures in San Diego forced migrants to cross the border in other areas. In 2011 the Imperial Irrigation District began installing lines with lifesaving buoys across the canal in 105 locations. Bilingual signs reading \\"Warning: Dangerous Water\\" were also installed in 1,414 locations along the canal. These safety projects cost $1.1 million.

Currently, the breed and Junior Showmanship competitions are hosted at Piers 92 and 94, while the group and Best in Show competitions take place at Madison Square Garden. The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is one of a handful of benched shows in the United States. Dogs are required to be on display in their assigned locations (show benches) during the entire show except when shown in the ring, groomed for showtime, or taken outside for elimination. This type of presentation allows spectators and breeders alike to have an opportunity of seeing all the entered dogs. (In the more common unbenched shows, dogs are required to be present only at assigned ring times.) History The Westminster Kennel Club was formed in 1877. The first Westminster show took place on May 8, 1877, making it second only to the Kentucky Derby, in terms of continuously held sporting events in the United States. (Both events were held despite the Great Depression & World War years.) The show originated as a show for gun dogs, primarily Setters and Pointers, initiated by a group of hunters who met regularly at the Westminster Hotel at Irving Place and Sixteenth Street in Manhattan. They decided to create a kennel club called the Westminster Kennel Club specifically to hold a dog show. The prizes for these first shows included such items as pearl- handled pistols, which were of use to the hunters and terriermen who worked these dogs in the field. WESTMINISTER HOTEL, IRVING PLACE AND 16TH STREET Held at Gilmore's Garden (Madison Square Garden) the Westminster show drew over 1,200 dogs. It proved so popular that it took four days instead of the three days originally scheduled. The club donated proceeds from the fourth day to the ASPCA for creation of a home for stray and disabled dogs. The Westminster Kennel Club predates the formation of the American Kennel Club by seven years and became the first club admitted to the AKC after AKC's founding in 1884. Breed parent clubs (e.g., the Collie Club of America) create the standards for judging their breeds, with the AKC administering the rules about shows and judging. Dogs are judged by how closely they conform to a written description of the ideal specimen of that breed (the breed standard). While many breeds no longer need to perform their original jobs and are bred mostly for companionship, they are still judged on their innate ability and physical makeup to perform their original jobs. Standards also include items that seem somewhat arbitrary such as color, eye shape, tail carriage, and more. Today, Westminster takes place over two days and nights every February. During the day, the dogs compete against other dogs of the same breed at Piers 92 and 94. Each Best of Breed winner (BOB) advances to the Group level. There are seven groups: Sporting, Hound, Working, Terrier, Toy, Non-Sporting, and Herding. Group competition occurs during the evenings at Madison Square Garden. The seven Group winners advance to Best in Show, the final round of the show. During Best in Show, also held at Madison Square Garden, a judge will select one of judging them as the Best In Show winner. Since 2014, the show allowed mixed-breed dogs to compete in an agility event.Jennifer Peltz, \\"Westminster Dog Show Adds Event With Mixed Breeds,\\" Associated Press, January 16, 2014. Westminster has held competitions in Junior Showmanship for handlers ages 9‚Äì18 since 1934. The eight finalists all receive scholarships for post-secondary schooling. The Club, through the Westminster Kennel Foundation also awards veterinary school scholarships for students from six schools yearly. The winning dog becomes \\"America's Dog\\" for the coming year. Hir reign begins with a media tour on the day following the show. S/he makes appearances on nearly all television network morning shows and visits the Observation Deck at the Empire State Building. The New York Stock Exchange also invites the winner to ring the opening bell. The event is widely celebrated in New York City every February. The Empire State Building salutes the show by lighting its tower in the Westminster colors of purple and gold for the duration of the show. Saks Fifth Avenue features a street window with a Westminster-themed display. Controversy Animal-rights advocates such as PETA protest the show, arguing that the propagation and celebration of purebreds ultimately add to the millions of dogs who end up at and die in shelters.Jennifer Peltz, \\"Westminster Dog Show Adds Event With Mixed Breeds,\\" Associated Press, 16 January 2014.\\"Pets By the Numbers,\\" Humane Society of the United States, September 27, 2013. Also, during the 2019 broadcast, Fox Sports was reprimanded by dog show sponsor Purina after a broadcast voice-over introduction of a dog breed was done by NASCAR Cup Series champion Kyle Busch, who is sponsored by a rival pet food maker, Mars Petcare. Announcers For many years, Roger A. Caras was known as \\"the Voice of Westminster\\" for providing the narration for the breed descriptions during the show.http://www.mercedsunstar.com/2012/02/11/v-print/2226292/pets-qa-best-in- show-really-means.html In 2001, Michael J. LaFave was named show announcer at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. He was replaced by Jim Fagan in 2010 but returned in 2011. Television CBS Sports covered the event from the late 1960s to the 1980s as part of its CBS Sports Spectacular anthology series. From 1984 until 2003, Universal's USA Network broadcast the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. Following Universal's acquisition by General Electric in 2003 to form NBC Universal, from 2004 until 2016, the show aired under the NBC Sports label. From 2006 through 2016, the Monday coverage was aired by business news channel CNBC due to conflicts with WWE Raw on the USA Network. On July 28, 2015, Fox Sports announced that it had acquired rights to the event under a 10-year deal beginning in 2017. For the first three years, Fox Sports 1 and Nat Geo Wild provided joint coverage the show. During NBC's coverage from 1990 to 2016, David Frei co-hosted the event with partners, Al Trautwig (1990‚Äì1991, 1993), Bud Collins (1992), Joe Garagiola (1994‚Äì2002), Mark McEwen (2003‚Äì2004), Lester Holt (2005, 2007‚Äì2008), Debbye Turner (2006), Mary Carillo (2009, 2011‚Äì2016), and Tamron Hall (2010). Frei provided the commentary of the 140th event for his final time. The 141st event in 2017 marked the beginning of the Fox Sports contract. There are two sets of hosting teams. From 2017‚Äì19, coverage aired on Fox Sports 1 and National Geographic Wild. For 2017, daytime breed judging was hosted by Justin Kutcher, Paula Nykiel and Jason Hoke and primetime coverage hosted by Chris Myers and Gail Miller Bisher. In 2018, daytime bred judging was hosted by Kutcher, Kimberly Meredith Cavanna and Don Sturz in 2018, while Hoke joined the evening booth of Myers and Bisher. In 2019, the judging experts were swapped, with the day event hosted by Kutcher, Cavanna, and Hoke and evening event by Myers, Bisher, and Sturz. Following the acquisition of National Geographic TV Channels and the Fox TV Studios by the Walt Disney Company in 2019, event coverage in 2020 is limited solely to the two Fox Sports channels, Fox Sports 1 for primetime and Fox Sports 2 for daytime judging. John Strong replaced Kutcher as host for daytime breed judging and Fox hosts were Myers, Bisher, and Sturz. In 2017, Fox Sports 1 aired a one-hour documentary, Crowned: Inside the Westminster Dog Show.  Requirements for entry  In 1884, the AKC began requiring that all dog participants be registered with the AKC and recognized for conformation show competition. In 2016, there are 199 breeds and varieties eligible for Westminster. Because of the show's popularity and prestige, starting in 1992 the AKC limited entries by requiring that dogs must have already earned their breed championship before appearing at Westminster. Later, the Westminster Kennel Club amended that rule - dogs only need one of the two required \\"major wins\\" towards their championship titles. However, they don't need to be finished champions to enter. For the 2020 show the requirement that a dog be a Champion was reinstated by the Westminster Kennel Club and the entry limit decreased to 2500. The conformation show was also spread over 3 days instead of the traditional 2 days, due to the unavailability of one of the usual venues for the event. \\\\- Westminster Kennel Club Exhibitor Brief August 2019 The top five dogs in each breed (based on breed points earned in AKC conformation showing through October 31 of the preceding year), as well as the Best of Breed winner from each breed's national specialty show, receive printed invitations by mail and are eligible for early entry. After that entry deadline passes, other dogs with at least one \\"major win\\" may enter, up to a cut-off entry total of 2800 dogs. There is no prohibition against a winner competing again in future Westminster shows. Seven dogs have won multiple Westminster championships: six dogs in consecutive years (including Warren Remedy, the only three-time champion of the event) and one dog in non- consecutive years. Since 1972, however, there have been no repeat winners. (See List of Best in Show winners of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.) Dogs of all breeds, including mutts, may participate in the show's agility competition. There is a title for the highest-ranking mutt in the agility round - the \\"All American Dog.\\"  Winning breeds  Through the 134th Westminster Show (February 2010), Best in Show has been won by the Terrier group 45 out of the 103 times that the prize has been awarded since 1907,WestminsterKennelClub.org - Best In Show Awards By Breed (1907-2010) more than twice as many wins as any other group. The single breed that has won the most is the Wire Fox Terrier, which has won 14 times.

It also includes influences of Brazilian music such as frevo, forr√≥ and carixada. The word Ax√© comes from the Yoruba term √†·π£·∫π, meaning ‚Äúsoul, light, spirit or good vibrations‚Äù. Ax√© is also present in the Candombl√© religion, as ‚Äúthe imagined spiritual power and energy bestowed upon practitioners by the pantheon of orix√°s‚Äù. Roots and History of Ax√© Numerous different African cultures were brought to Brazil due to slavery, which lead to the creation of the vibrancy and complexity of Brazil and its culture. Therefore, several of Brazil's popular music styles have derived from African cultures and African diasporic influences, including samba, lambada, funk and ax√©. There is a tendency by Brazilian musicians to draw inspiration and utilize themes, imagery and symbolic symbols from the Candombl√© religion and its African roots. Artists such as Gilberto Gil, Vinicius de Moraes, Caetano Veloso, Sergio Mendes, Daniela Mercury, Carlinhos Brown, among others, have all used African culture, religion and symbols as inspirations and lyrics of their songs. Ax√© was a fusion of African and Caribbean styles such as merengue, salsa and reggae, as well as being influenced by other Afro-Brazilian musical styles such as frevo and forr√≥. Ax√© music was labeled in 1980s, but it was already noticeable in the 50s with the incorporation of the ‚Äúguitarra baiana‚Äù (guitar from Bahia). This genre was purely instrumental, and remained so until the 1970s, when Moraes Moreira (of the band Novos Baianos) went solo. Il√™ Aiy√™ women symbolic of the Afro-Brazilian culture and community in Salvador, Bahia.334x334px] In 1974, carnival in Salvador, Bahia began taking shape. A group of Afro- Brazilians civil rights activists formed Il√™ Aiy√™, a music ensemble that derived their heavy rhythm from Candombl√©‚Äôs religious ceremonies. Quickly, Il√™ Aiy√™ gained a huge following, allowing them to influence other artists to incorporate the samba-reggae style and the heavy beats to their music. Groups such as Timbalada, Olodum and Filhos de Gandhi also shared the heavy beats and rhythms with Il√™ Aiy√™, as well as utilizing African symbols such as typical outfits and instruments that all these bands use to perform. Olodum's rehearsals soon became a starting point for up and coming artists, composers, and music. In these rehearsals, artists presented and experimented with their music, in search for legitimacy from the population. In 1985 Luiz Caldas released his LP record called Magia, which included the track Fricote. Although the lyrics were not complex, the rhythm was perfect for the climate in Bahia. The song became the representation of the entertainment of Bahia's musicality. Popularity When Daniela Mercury released O Canto da Cidade in 1992, ax√© entered the mainstream pop music scene and became one of the most popular genres in Brazil. The song remained in the first position in the charts for months and ended up becoming an anthem for the people in Brazil. O Canto da Cidade opened doors for artists and bands such as Cheiro de Amor, Asa de √Åguia, Chiclete com Banana and Banda Eva, who launched Ivete Sangalo and led her to embark in her solo career. These bands are still relevant in Brazilian music scene, and still spreads the ax√© genre across the country and throughout the world. Two years prior to Daniela Mercury's success, the American and European released Margareth Menezes' Elegib√¥, which took the style to international audiences. Ivete Sangalo as she performs in Salvador's Carnaval in 2012. Ax√© Today Currently, the biggest ax√© music star is Ivete Sangalo. Ax√© Bahia is a six-member eurodance/ax√© music group from Brazil. They achieved fame in South America with their single \\"Beijo na Boca\\", and was also extremely popular in the Spanish-language version, \\"Beso en la Boca\\". International Exposure of Ax√© Olodum drummers playing their instruments as in the video clip They Don't Really Care About Us. A notable moment in ax√©'s history was Ivete Sangalo's success in the United States. After selling out 70,000 capacity soccer stadiums in Brazil, Ivete Sangalo sold out Madison Square Garden in 2010. In an interview before her MSG concert, she affirmed that, \\"When I started in Brazil, I was also unknown, and Brazil is a gigantic place with lots of talent. I haven't come here with the pretension of being well known, but what I've come do to here, I've come to do right\\". In this concert, she was able to bring to the United States a \\"mini-version of Carnaval\\". Ivete Sangalo is the only artist to have participated in all editions of the concert Rock in Rio Lisbon, as well as participating in Rock in Rio Brazil, Spain and United States. Another remarkable instance for ax√© music was when Michael Jackson recorded his 1996 hit They Don't Really Care About Us in Bahia. Spike Lee directed the video clip for this song, and the video clip was filmed in the historical neighborhood of Pelourinho in Salvador, Bahia, and in a favela in Rio de Janeiro. Michael Jackson collaborated with Olodum in this video, which featured 200 members of the band playing their different kinds of drums to Salvador's samba-reggae music. Due to this video, Olodum was exposed to 140 countries, increasing the outreach of the Afro-Brazilian samba-reggae music.

American physicist William Higinbotham designed the game in 1958 for display at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's annual public exhibition after learning that the government research institution's Donner Model 30 analog computer could simulate trajectories with wind resistance. He designed the game, displayed on an oscilloscope and played with two custom aluminum controllers, in a few hours, after which he and technician Robert V. Dvorak built it over three weeks. The game's visuals show a representation of a tennis court viewed from the side, and players adjust the angle of their shots with a knob on their controller and try to hit the ball over the net by pressing a button. The game was very popular during the three- day exhibition, with players lining up to see the game, especially high school students. It was shown again the following year with a larger oscilloscope screen and a more complicated design that could simulate different gravity levels. It was then dismantled and largely forgotten until the late 1970s when Higinbotham testified in court about the game during lawsuits between Magnavox and Ralph H. Baer over video game patents. Since then, it has been celebrated as one of the earliest video games, and Brookhaven has made recreations of the original device. Under some definitions Tennis for Two is considered the first video game, as while it did not include any technological innovations over prior games, it was the first computer game to be created purely as an entertainment product rather than for academic research or commercial technology promotion. Development Brookhaven for the game's 25th anniversary. In 1958, American physicist William Higinbotham worked in the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, as the head of the instrumentation division. Higinbotham had a bachelor's degree in physics from Williams College, and had previously worked as a technician in the physics department at Cornell University while unsuccessfully pursuing a Ph.D. there. He served as the head of the electronics division of the Manhattan Project from 1943 to 1945, and began working at Brookhaven in 1947, which focused on researching peaceful uses of atomic power. Once a year, the government research facility held an exhibition for the public, with one day each for high school students, college students, and the general public. The exhibition largely consisted of tours and static displays, with some attempts at making displays with \\"action\\", so for the 1958 exhibition Higinbotham decided to make an interactive display to entertain the visitors. While reading the instruction manual for one of Brookhaven's computers, a Donner Model 30 analog computer, he learned that the computer could calculate ballistic missile trajectories or a bouncing ball with wind resistance, and he decided to use this ability to form the foundation of a game. He later recalled his intentions were that \\"it might liven up the place to have a game that people could play, and which could convey the message that our scientific endeavors have relevance for society.\\" Modern recreation of the controller Higinbotham designed a game that used an oscilloscope to display the path of a simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and a knob. Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided it would make the controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven. Presentation The setup for Tennis for Two as exhibited in 1959 Tennis for Two was first shown on October 18, 1958. The game was rendered as a horizontal line, representing the tennis court, and a short vertical line in the center, representing the tennis net. The first player would press the button on their controller to send the ball, a point of light, over the net, and it would either hit the net, reach the other side of the court, or fly out of bounds. The second player could then hit the ball back with their controller while it was on their side, either before or after it bounced on the ground. Hundreds of visitors lined up to play the new game during its debut. Higinbotham claimed later that \\"the high schoolers liked it best, you couldn't pull them away from it.\\" Due to the game's popularity, an upgraded version was shown the following year, with enhancements including a larger screen and different levels of simulated gravity. Players could set the game to simulate the gravity levels of the Moon or Jupiter. Higinbotham referred to the game as Tennis for Two, though a placard attached to the 1959 version titled it \\"Computer Tennis\\". After the 1959 exhibition, the game was dismantled so its components could be put to other uses. Legacy After being dismantled, Tennis for Two was largely forgotten. It remained virtually unknown until the late 1970s and early 1980s when Higinbotham was called on to testify in court cases for defendants sued by Magnavox over the video game patents of Ralph H. Baer. Having discovered the game, the lawyers for the defense unsuccessfully attempted to have the game declared prior art to invalidate Baer's patents on television video games, resulting in attention being given to the nearly 20-year-old game as possibly the first video game. It received further attention as the subject of articles in Creative Computing and Video Replay in 1982 and 1983 highlighting its possible status as the first video game; the editor of Creative Computing, David H. Ahl, had played Tennis for Two at Brookhaven in 1958, and dubbed Higinbotham the \\"Grandfather of Video Games\\". Higinbotham himself felt that the game was an obvious extension of the Donner Model 30's bouncing ball program and therefore not worthy of patenting or a large part of his legacy; he preferred to be remembered for his post-World War II nuclear non-proliferation work. 1997 recreation of the original Tennis for Two setup In 1997, a team at Brookhaven recreated the game for Brookhaven's 50th anniversary. The reconstruction took about three months, partially because the parts were not readily available. This recreation was also displayed at the 2008 celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the original game. The replica implemented an analog computer using solid-state operational amplifier devices instead of vacuum tubes as the original Donner Model 30 did. In 2010, it was replaced with a restored Donner Model 3400 analog computer. In 2011, Stony Brook University founded the William A. Higinbotham Game Studies Collection, dedicated to \\"documenting the material culture of screen-based game media\\", and \\"collecting and preserving the texts, ephemera, and artifacts that document the history and work of early game innovator and Brookhaven National Laboratory scientist William A. Higinbotham, who in 1958 invented the first interactive analog computer game, Tennis for Two.\\" Tennis for Two is considered under some definitions to be the first video game. Other candidates with stronger candidacies from a technological standpoint include the 1947 cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, though it did not run on a computing device; the 1950 Bertie the Brain, the earliest known game to run on a computer, though it used light bulbs for a display; and OXO and a draughts game by Christopher Strachey in 1952, the earliest digital computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen. Tennis for Two, though it contained no technological developments to separate it from earlier games, has the distinction of being the earliest known computer game with visuals created purely for entertainment purposes. Prior games were created primarily for academic research purposes or to demonstrate the computing power of the underlying machine, with the exception of the non-computer based cathode-ray tube amusement device. This, therefore, makes Tennis for Two the first video game under some definitions from a philosophical viewpoint rather than a technical one and a distinctive moment in the early history of video games.

Legitimation in the social sciences refers to the process whereby an act, process, or ideology becomes legitimate by its attachment to norms and values within a given society. It is the process of making something acceptable and normative to a group or audience. Legitimate power is the right to exercise control over others by virtue of the authority of one's superior organization position or status. Power and influence For example, the legitimation of power can be understood using Max Weber's traditional bases of power. In a bureaucracy, people gain legitimate use of power by their positions in which it is widely agreed that the specified person hold authority. There is no inherent right to wield power. For example, a president can exercise power and authority because the position is fully legitimated by society as a whole. In another example, if an individual attempts to convince others that something is \\"right,\\" they can invoke generally accepted arguments that support their agenda. Advocacy groups must legitimate their courses of action based on invoking specific social norms and values. Invoking these norms and values allows the group to proceed in a rational and coherent manner with the expectation that their subsequent behavior is legitimated by the norms and values which guide their organizations. Audience-based view Sociologists and organizational ecologists have shown that legitimation originates from consensus among certain agents (an audience) on which features and behaviors of an actor (a candidate) should be viewed as appropriate and desirable within a widespread system of social codes.Zuckerman, E. W. (1999) ‚ÄúThe categorical imperative: Securities analysts and the legitimacy discount.‚Äù American Journal of Sociology, 104: 1398-1438. An audience-based theory of legitimation posits that various social audiences develop expectations about what organizations can or should do and accordingly evaluate organizational action. Candidate organizations that pass the code test are legitimated in the social environment. One of the consequences is that they enjoy greater survival.Hannan, M. T., L. P√≥los, and G. R. Carroll (2007) Logics of Organization Theory: Audiences, Codes, and Ecologies. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. Early elaborations of this idea include attempts to understand the variations of codes across different audiences;Pontikes, E. (2012) \\"Two Sides of the Same Coin: How Ambiguous Classification Affects Multiple Audiences' Evaluations,\\" Administrative Science Quarterly, 57(1) 81-118. the impact of code violation on organizational performance;Monin Philippe, Duran Rodolphe, Rao Hayagreeva (2007).

Perretti (2008) ‚ÄúThe Structure of Consensus: Network Ties, Legitimation and Exit Rates of U.S. Feature Film Producer Organizations‚Äù, Administrative Science Quarterly, 2008, 53(2): 145-182. Family law Legitimation can also be used as a legal term where a father of a child born out of wedlock becomes the child's legal father. Prior to legitimation, the child is said to be illegitimate. Once a child has been legitimated, he or she is entitled to such benefits as ordained by law as he or she would if that man had been married to the child's mother at the time of the child's birth. (Some benefits are still withheld under various systems, such as the British peerage.) The father is responsible for providing support to the child and the child is entitled to inherit from the father. While legitimation can be as simple as a statement by the father, in some jurisdictions the father must officially recognise the child. This option is typically also available to non-biological fathers (\\"social fathers\\"). Canon law Legitimation is a term in Roman Catholic canon law to remove the canonical irregularity of illegitimacy for candidates for the priesthood.

In addition to this derogatory connotation, it may serve as a term of respect and praise. The phrase \\"the Man is keeping me down\\" is commonly used to describe oppression. The phrase \\"stick it to the Man\\" encourages resistance to authority, and essentially means \\"fight back\\" or \\"resist\\", either passively, openly or via sabotage. History As a phrase meaning \\"the boss\\" it dates from at least 1918. In the Southern U.S., the phrase came to be applied to any man or any group in a position of authority, or to authority in the abstract. From about the 1950s the phrase was also an underworld code word for police, the warden of a prison or other law enforcement or penal authorities. The use of this term was expanded to counterculture groups and their battles against authority, such as the Yippies, which, according to a May 19, 1969 article in U.S. News and World Report, had the \\"avowed aim ... to destroy 'The Man', their term for the present system of government\\". The term eventually found its way into humorous usage, such as in a December 1979 motorcycle ad from the magazine Easyriders which featured the tagline, \\"California residents: Add 6% sales tax for The Man.\\" In present day, the phrase has been popularized in commercials and cinema. It was featured particularly prominently as a recurring motif in the 2003 film School of Rock. The film Undercover Brother had as a plot element a fictional organization headed by \\"The Man\\", an actual man in charge of oppressing African Americans. =Use as praise= The term has also been used as an approbation or form of praise. This may refer to the recipient's status as the leader or authority within a particular context, or it might be assumed to be a shortened form of a phrase like \\"He is the man (who is in charge).\\" In more modern usage, it can be a superlative compliment (\\"you da man!\\") indicating that the subject is currently standing out amongst their peers even though they have no special designation or rank, such as a basketball player who is performing better than the other players on the court. It can also be used as a genuine compliment with an implied, slightly exaggerated or sarcastic tone, usually indicating that the person has indeed impressed the speaker but by doing something relatively trivial. The phrase has also been used in professional wrestling to refer to the top stars in the business. Some notable examples include Ric Flair, Seth Rollins, and Becky Lynch.

He is a son and a cup-bearer of the god Dionysus. Comus represents anarchy and chaos. His mythology occurs in the later times of antiquity. During his festivals in Ancient Greece, men and women exchanged clothes. He was depicted as a young man on the point of unconsciousness from drink. He had a wreath of flowers on his head and carried a torch that was in the process of being dropped. Unlike the purely carnal Pan or purely intoxicated Dionysos, Comus was a god of excess.

It was established in 2002 to handle South Korean tourist traffic to Mount Kumgang (Diamond Mountain). It was one of the symbols of the South Korean Sunshine Policy. History = Development and boom period = Beginning in 1998, South Korean and other foreign tourists were allowed to visit Mount Kumgang, traveling at first by cruise ship, and then by bus on a newly built road through the Korean Demilitarized Zone.

Much of the infrastructure in the area has been built by the South Korean Hyundai Asan company which received a 30-year exclusive deal to develop the region. In addition to hotels, it was also to include golf courses, ski resorts and other facilities.

China Daily. July 12, 2008 The South Korean request for a joint inquiry was denied. Forensic tests done on Park suggest that she was standing still or walking slowly when shot. This contradicted the North Korean claim that she was running and did not heed warnings. Immediately after the shooting, the South Korean government suspended tours to the resort. In August 2008 the North Koreans announced that they would expel \\"unnecessary\\" South Korean workers from the resort.N Korea steps up row with South, BBC News Online, August 3, 2008 In March 2010, the DPRK government warned of \\"extraordinary measures\\" if the tourism ban were not lifted. On April 23, 2010, the North Korean government seized 5 properties owned by South Korea at the resort, saying that it was done \\"in compensation for the damage the North side suffered due to the suspension of the tour for a long period.\\" In seizing the properties, North Korea also alluded to the Baengnyeong incident, showing displeasure with South Korea blaming North Korea for the sinking of the ship. Hyundai Asan losses from this incident are estimated at hundreds of million of dollars lost from investment, and further losses due to suspension of tourism- generated income. Since April 2010, North Korea is now permitting companies to run tours from the North Korean side, making it appear increasingly unlikely that tours will be resumed from the South. However, on October 1, 2010, news reports said, \\"Red Cross officials from the two Koreas agreed Friday to hold reunions for families separated by the Korean War amid mixed signals from North Korea on easing tensions over the sinking of a South Korean warship. One hundred families from each country will attend the meetings from Oct. 30 to Nov. 5 at a hotel and reunion center at the North's scenic Diamond Mountain resort, Unification Ministry spokeswoman Lee Jong-joo said.\\" As of September 2011 North Korea have begun operating cruises directly from Rason in north- eastern North Korea, to the port in Mount Kumgang, offering visitors the chance to stay in the resorts previously run by the south. Although they are aimed primarily at Chinese guests, western companies are also offering the tours. Despite the Lee Myung-bak government expressing a verbal anti-North Korean stance, the head of the government-funded Korea Institute for National Unification, Kim Tae-u, proposed that the South Korean government renegotiate on the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region with North Korea without any official apology on North Korea's military actions towards the ROKS Cheonan sinking and the Bombardment of Yeonpyeong. A 2018 travel book described most facilities in the region closed due to lack of visitors. In 2018, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korea's Kim Jong-un agreed to restart tours to the resort. In 2019, Kim Jong-un visited the site and criticised the facilities: \\"They are not only very backward in terms of architecture but look so shabby as they are not properly cared for. The buildings are just a hotchpotch with no national character at all.\\" He also ordered the South Korean facilities to be replaced by \\"modern facilities\\". This has been criticized by the South Korean government which instead proposed renovating the complex. In January 2020, the North Korean government said that redevelopment of the site was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Dr Richard Bentley (1756), one of Roubiliac's marble busts for Trinity College, Cambridge Life Roubiliac was born in Lyon. According to J. T. Smith he was trained in the studio of Balthasar Permoser in Dresden, where Permoser, a product of Bernini's workshop, was working for the Protestant Elector of Saxony,Smith 1829. and later in Paris, in the studio of his fellow-townsman Nicolas Coustou.

In London, he was employed by \\"Carter, the statuary\\" but was introduced by Edward Walpole, son of the Prime Minister, to Henry Cheere, who took him on as an assistant. Sir Edward's intervention resulted in the commission for half the busts in the series for Trinity College, Dublin, and for the Argyll monument commission, if Horace Walpole is correct in his Anecdotes of Painting in England.Horace Walpole, Anecdotes of Painting in England, vol. III \\"Statuaries in the Reign of George II\\" In 1738 he had a great success with a seated figure of Handel, commissioned by Jonathan Tyers, owner of the Vauxhall Gardens. The statue blends realism and allegory: Handel is shown in modern dress, but plays an Ancient Greek lyre, and has a putto sitting at his feet. It is now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.Whinney 1971:77‚Äì 8 He was recommended for this commission by Cheere.Smith 1829 vol. II:94; the often-repeated cost of 300 guineas reported by K. A. Esdaile was a published estimate for the sculpture and an elaborate architectural niche, never executed (Whinney 1981:454 note 9). Its prominent placement in the fashionable pleasure grounds \\"fixed Roubiliac's fame\\" as Walpole put it, and he was able to open the studio in St Martin's Lane that he maintained until his death. Roubiliac was a founding member of the St Martin's Lane Academy, a professional association and fraternity of rococo artists that was a forerunner to the Royal Academy. His studio in St Martin's Lane became its meeting room; its members came together again for his funeral.Listed in Smith 1829: vol. II:98.

The mourning figure of Eloquence, the notably unkind John Thomas Smith found to be \\"such a memorial of his powers, that even his friend Pope could not have equalled it by an epitaph\\". Even when the patrons were prominent, the churches in which the monuments were installed often lay deep in the English countryside: the monuments to the Duke of Montagu (1752), and of his wife Mary (1753), are in the church at Warkton, Northamptonshire; Horace Walpole, an inveterate country house visitor, noted them: his verdict was \\"well-performed and magnificent, but wanting in simplicity\\".Walpole, Anecdotes. Neoclassical taste, trained to appreciate svelte line and idealised refinements of nature, did not favour Roubiliac's vigour and immediacy: to J.T. Smith the legs of the figure of Hercules, supporting the bust of Sir Peter Warren in Roubliac's monument in Westminster Abbey (1753) seemed \\"copied from a chairman's, and the arms from those of a waterman\\"Smith 1829, vol.

Part of the memorial (1760) placed by Ann Bellamy Lynn to her husband George at St Mary's church Southwick, Northamptonshire About the mid-century Roubiliac was employed for a time as a modeller at the Chelsea porcelain factory, a new outlet for sculptors' talent in Britain; its entrepreneur Nicholas Sprimont stood godfather to the sculptor's daughter Sophie, in 1744.; many pieces have been attributed to him; see but only Hogarth's pug \\"Trump\\" is securely known to be by Roubiliac (J.

His second wife (a considerable heiress) having recently died, he took a brief tour to Italy towards the end of 1752 in the company of several artists.Gunnis 1968; Whinney 1981:. Soon after his death an auction sale of the contents of his studio was held, on 12‚Äì15 May 1762, from which Dr Matthew Maty purchased a number of his plaster and terracotta models, which he presented to the newly-founded British Museum. Prices were derisory, and when his effects were totalled up, Roubiliac's creditors, J.T. Smith said, had to be satisfied with one shilling sixpence in the pound.Smith 1829: vol. II:99. Roubiliac was buried in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, where he had been married. Works Roubiliac was mainly employed for portrait busts, and from the 1740s especially for sepulchral monuments; these were, in essence, the two outlets for free-standing sculpture in Britain at the time. He also made several full- length portrait sculptures. His most important works in Westminster Abbey are the monuments to the Duke of Argyll (1748) ‚Äì the work which first established his fame as a sculptor ‚Äì Handel (1761), Sir Peter Warren, Marshal Wade, and Lady Elizabeth Nightingale (1761). Busts by Louis-Francois Roubiliac, Wren Library, Trinity College, Cambridge University At Cambridge he made the statues of George I in the Senate House, Cambridge, the Duke of Somerset and Sir Isaac Newton. Trinity College, Cambridge, has a series of busts by him of distinguished members of the college. The statue of George II erected in Golden Square, London, was also his work. The celebrated bust of William Shakespeare, known as the Davenant bust, in the possession of the Garrick Club, London, must be attributed to Roubiliac. His friend Sir Joshua Reynolds painted a copy of the Chandos Portrait for him.It was sold in Roubiliac's sale in a lot of eight paintings that brought just ten shillings; it was identified and rescued by the father of John Flaxman, who immediately resold it for three guineas; the actor Edward Malone subsequently owned it (Smith 1829, vol. II:99). The statue of Shakespeare (1758), a commission from David Garrick to be set up in his garden shrine to Shakespeare at Hampton House, Twickenham, and bequeathed by the actor to the English nation, is in the British Museum; a terracotta model dated 1757 is in collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

MacLane was a very popular author for her time,New York Times obituary article, 9 August 1929 scandalizing the populace with her shocking bestselling first memoir and to a lesser extent her two following books. She was considered wild and uncontrollable, a reputation she nurtured, and was openly bisexual as well as a vocal feminist. In her writings, she compared herself to another frank young memoirist, Marie Bashkirtseff, who died a few years after MacLane was born,Story of Mary MacLane (1902 and 1911), first entry. and H. L. Mencken called her \\"the Butte Bashkirtseff.\\"  Early life and family  MacLane was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in 1881, but her family moved to the Red River area of Minnesota, settling in Fergus Falls, which her father helped develop. After his death in 1889, her mother remarried a family friend and lawyer, H. Gysbert Klenze. Soon after, the family moved to Montana, first settling in Great Falls and finally in Butte, where Klenze drained the family funds pursuing mining and other ventures. MacLane spent the remainder of her life in the United States. She began writing for her school paper in 1898.Tender Darkness, bibliography  Writing  Mary MacLane (From the inside cover of The Story of Mary MacLane, Herbert S. Stone and Company, 1902) From the beginning, MacLane's writing was characterized by a direct, fiery, highly individualistic style. She was, however, also strongly influenced by such American regional realists as John Townsend Trowbridge (with whom she exchanged a few letters), Maria Louise Pool, and Hamlin Garland. At the age of 19 in 1901, MacLane wrote her first book, titled by its author I Await the Devil's Coming but changed by its publishers, Herbert S. Stone & Co., to The Story of Mary MacLane. It sold 100,000 copies in the first month Tender Darkness, introduction and was influential on young women, but was pilloried by conservative critics and readers, and lightly ridiculed by H. L. Mencken. Some critics have suggested that even by today's standards, MacLane's writing is raw, honest, unflinching, self-aware, sensual, and extreme. She wrote openly about egoism and her own self-love, about sexual attraction and love for other women, and even about her desire to marry the Devil. Her second book, My Friend Annabel Lee was published by Stone in 1903. More experimental in style than her debut book, it was not nearly so sensational, though MacLane was said to have made a fairly large amount of money. Her final book, I, Mary Maclane: A Diary of Human Days was published by Frederick A. Stokes in 1917 and sold moderately well but may have been overshadowed by America's recent entry into World War I. In 1917, she wrote and starred in the 90-minute autobiographical silent film titled Men Who Have Made Love to Me, for Essanay Studios. Produced by film pioneer George Kirke Spoor and based on MacLane's 1910 article of the same title for a Butte newspaper, it has been speculated to have been an extremely early, if not the earliest, sustained breaking of the fourth wall in cinema, with the writer- star directly addressing the audience. Though stills and some subtitles have survived, the film is now believed to be lost.  Influence  Among the numerous authors who referenced, parodied, or answered MacLane were Mark Twain, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Harriet Monroe, famed lawyer Clarence Darrow, Ring Lardner Jr., Sherwood Anderson and Daniel Clowes in Ice Haven. Among the less- remembered was Gertrude Sanborn, who published an optimistic riposte to MacLane's 1917 I, Mary MacLane under the title I, Citizen of Eternity (1920).  Personal life  MacLane had always chafed, or felt, \\"anxiety of place,\\" at living in Butte, which was a mining city far from cultural centers, and used the money from her first book's sales to travel to Chicago and then throughout the East Coast. She lived in Rockland, Massachusetts, wintering in St. Augustine, Florida, from 1903‚Äì1908, then in Greenwich Village from 1908‚Äì1909, where she continued writing and, by her later published accounts, living a decadent and Bohemian existence. She was close friends with the feminist writer Inez Haynes Irwin, who is referenced in some of MacLane's 1910 writing in a Butte newspaper and who in turn mentioned MacLane in a 1911 magazine article. For a period she lived with her friend Caroline M. Branson, who had been the long-time companion of Maria Louise Pool until the latter's death in 1898. They lived in the Rockland's house that Pool left to Branson. Mary Maclane also had a multi-decade friendship with Harriet Monroe. MacLane died in Chicago in early August 1929, aged 48. She was less frequently discussed through the mid to late 20th century, and her prose remained out of print until late 1993, when The Story of Mary MacLane and some of her newspaper feature work was republished in Tender Darkness: A Mary MacLane Anthology.  Contemporary collections and performances  In 2011, the publisher of Tender Darkness (1993) published an expanded anthology titled Human Days: A Mary MacLane Reader (with a Foreword by Bojana Novakovic). In 2011, Novakovic wrote and performed \\"The Story of Mary MacLane ‚Äì By Herself\\" in Melbourne, Australia, which was subsequently staged in Sydney, Australia in 2012. In the 2010s, MacLane's work was translated into French, Danish, and Spanish. A German edition was published in 2020.

Life Cook's father was George Simon Cook of Grantham, Lincolnshire, a solicitor, of the firm of Le Blanc & Cook, 18 New Bridge Street, Blackfriars, London, who died on 12 September 1852, leaving a family of nine children. Edward Dutton, the second son, was born at 9 Grenville Street, Brunswick Square, London, on 30 January 1829. At the age of six he went to a school kept by a Miss Boswell at Haverstock Hill, was removed to another school at Bradmore House, Chiswick, and finally, about 1843, entered King's College School. Having completed his education, he was articled to his father, and remained in his office about four years, when he obtained a situation in the Madras Railway Company's office in New Broad Street, city of London, and in his spare time followed his artistic and literary tastes. As soon as he was able to do so he left the railway company and devoted himself entirely to literature as a profession. Having studied painting under Rolt, and learned engraving, he at one time sought employment on Punch as a draughtsman on wood. In 1859 he became a member of the Artists' Rifles, and also a member of the Ramblers' Club, which met every night from November to May at Dick's Tavern, 8 Fleet Street. About this period, in conjunction with Mr. Leopold Lewis, he wrote a melodrama entitled The Dove and the Serpent, which was produced with much success, under Mr. Nelson Lee's management, at the City of London Theatre. Dutton Cook in 1883 From 1867 to October 1875 he was dramatic critic to the Pall Mall Gazette, and from that date to his death to the World newspaper. He was the writer of numerous articles on art topics in various reviews, newspapers, and periodicals, and the author of many works of fiction. Of the latter, Paul Foster's Daughter, his first work, served to establish his reputation, and the production of The Trials of the Tredgolds in the following year (1862) in Temple Bar was a great literary success. His later novels did not maintain the popularity which his earlier works achieved. This was from no lack of merit, but because he was not sufficiently sensational in his style to suit the spirit and fashion of the period. He was one of the contributors to the Dictionary of National Biography, and furnished the dramatic and theatrical lives in letter A to the first and second volumes. He died suddenly of heart disease on 11 September 1883, and was buried in Highgate cemetery on 15 September. Family On 20 August 1874 he married Linda Scates (second daughter of Joseph Scates), a pupil of the Royal Academy of Music and a well-known pianist, by whom he left one daughter, named Sylvia after the heroine of her father's first novel.

He was a particular favorite of Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of the King and an important patron of the arts. He made a graceful rococo sculpture of Vertumnus and Pomone, two characters from the Metamorphoses of Ovid, which was a favorite theme of Madame Pompadour. The sculpture is now in the Louvre. He also made a state of Madame Pompadour in the costume of a nymph.

The live demonstration featured the introduction of a complete computer hardware and software system called the oN-Line System or, more commonly, NLS. The 90-minute presentation essentially demonstrated almost all the fundamental elements of modern personal computing: windows, hypertext, graphics, efficient navigation and command input, video conferencing, the computer mouse, word processing, dynamic file linking, revision control, and a collaborative real- time editor (collaborative work). Engelbart's presentation was the first to publicly demonstrate all of these elements in a single system. The demonstration was highly influential and spawned similar projects at Xerox PARC in the early 1970s. The underlying technologies influenced both the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows graphical user interface operating systems in the 1980s and 1990s.  Etymology  The first use of this name for Engelbart's talk is ascribed to journalist Steven Levy in his 1994 book Insanely Great: The Life and Times of Macintosh, the Computer That Changed Everything, where he describes the event as \\"a calming voice from Mission Control as the truly final frontier whizzed before their eyes. It was the mother of all demos.\\" The terminology reflected contemporary use of phrases of form 'mother of all ...' given currency by then-President of Iraq Saddam Hussein's proffer of a mother of all battles, in lead-up to the 1991 Gulf War. Andries van Dam (who was present at the demo) repeated the phrase in 1995 while introducing Engelbart at the Vannevar Bush Symposium at MIT, and van Dam's FRESS hypertext system adopted several concepts from the demo. The phrase was also cited in John Markoff's 2005 book What the Dormouse Said.  Background  Much of Engelbart's thought that led to the development of his Augmentation Research Center (ARC), as well as the oN-Line System, was derived from the \\"research culture\\" of World War II and the early Cold War. A notable source of inspiration to Engelbart was the article \\"As We May Think\\", written by Vannevar Bush in The Atlantic magazine, which Engelbart read while stationed as a US Navy radar technician in the Philippines in 1946. In Engelbart's view, in order to steer society into the right use of scientific knowledge derived from the war, that knowledge would need to be better managed and regulated. In his book From Counterculture to Cyberculture, Fred Turner gave voice to this view, which arose from seeing the unintended effects of technology on the postwar world: > [T]he American military had developed technologies with which it might > destroy the world. In its wake, scientists and technologists had begun to > fan out around the globe, seeking to use their knowledge to eradicate > disease and increase food production, often in an effort to win the cold war > loyalties of Third World nations. Engelbart had read about these efforts and > saw that they often backfired. Rapid food production led to the depletion of > the soil; the eradication of insects led to ecological imbalances. This ultimately led to the idea that beyond merely performing calculations, computers could be used to augment the capabilities of the human mind. Demonstration Engelbart had assembled a team of computer engineers and programmers at his Augmentation Research Center (ARC) located in Stanford University's Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the early 1960s. His idea was to free computing from merely being about number crunching and for it to become a tool for communications and information-retrieval. He wanted to turn Vannevar Bush's idea for a Memex machine into reality, where a machine used interactively by one person could \\"Augment\\" their intelligence. Over the course of six years, with the funding help of both NASA and ARPA, his team went about putting together all the elements that would make such a computer system a reality. At the urging of ARPA's director, Robert Taylor, the NLS would make its first public appearance at the 1968 Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco's Civic Auditorium. The conference session was presented under the title A research center for augmenting human intellect. Approximately 1,000 computer professionals were in attendance in the auditorium to witness the presentation. Notable attendees in the audience included Alan Kay, Charles Irby and Andy van Dam, as well as Bob Sproull. Engelbart, with the help of his geographically distributed team (including Bill Paxton), with Bill English directing the presentation's technical elements, demonstrated NLS's functions. The presentation used an Eidophor video projector that allowed the video output from the NLS computer to be displayed on a large high screen so the audience could see what Engelbart was doing. Additionally, live video of him and his associates from ARC in Menlo Park, about away, was combined with the computer's output on the Eidophor. The Augment researchers also created two customized homemade modems at 1200 baudhigh-speed for 1968linked via a leased line to transfer data from the computer workstation keyboard and mouse at the Civic Auditorium to their Menlo Park headquarter's SDS-940 computer. In order to provide live two-way video between the lab and the conference hall, two microwave links were used. English also commanded a video switcher that controlled what was displayed on the big screen. The camera operator in Menlo Park was Stewart Brand‚Äîat the time, a non-computer person, best known as the editor of the Whole Earth Catalog‚Äîwho also advised Engelbart and the team about how to present the demo. During the 90-minute presentation, Engelbart used his mouse prototype to move around the screen, highlight text, and resize windows. This was the first time that an integrated system for manipulating text onscreen was presented publicly. Engelbart would simultaneously appear on a portion of the projected screen, along with the computer's output and then demonstrated collaborative editing and teleconferencing. At separate times, his Augment associates Jeff Rulifson and Bill Paxton appeared in another portion of the screen to help edit the text remotely from ARC. While they were editing they could see each other's screen, talk and see each other as well. He further demonstrated that clicking on underlined text would then link to another page of information, demonstrating the concept of hypertext. When he finished the demonstration, the audience gave him a standing ovation. To further demonstrate the system, a separate room was set aside so that attendees could take a closer look at the NLS workstations and ask Engelbart questions. One last notion is that of Engelbart's NLS system. As Fred Turner stated in his book From Counterculture to Cyberculture: > Engelbart promulgated a philosophy of 'bootstrapping', in which each > experimental transformation of the socio-technical system that was the NLS > would feed back into the system itself, causing it to evolve (and presumably > to improve). Influence Douglas Engelbart in 2008, at the 40th anniversary celebrations of \\"The Mother of All Demos\\" in San Francisco. Prior to the demonstration, a significant portion of the computer science community thought Engelbart was \\"a crackpot.\\" When he was finished, he was described as \\"dealing lightning with both hands.\\" Van Dam was working on a similar system, but had only begun work on it in 1967, and was stunned to see how mature NLS was: he practically accosted Engelbart with his line of questioning in the post-presentation question and answer session. After he finished interrogating Engelbart, van Dam agreed the NLS demo was the greatest thing he ever witnessed. Van Dam would go on to become a leader in teaching computer graphics in the 1970s.ACM SIGGRAPH: Report on Andy van Dam The actual impact on computer science however was limited: As the 1970s started, much of Engelbart's team departed ARC and went their own ways, with many of them ending up at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Among these people were Bill English, who would further improve upon the mouse. Also migrating to PARC was Engelbart's former backer at NASA and ARPA, Robert Taylor. Alan Kay, also in attendance at the demo, would go on to design an object-oriented computing environment called Smalltalk while he was at PARC. By 1973, the Xerox Alto was a fully functional personal computer similar to the NLS terminal which Engelbart had demonstrated in 1968, but much smaller and physically refined. With its mouse-driven GUI, the Alto would go on to influence Steve Jobs and Apple's Macintosh computer and operating system in the 1980s. Eventually, Microsoft's Windows operating system would follow the Macintosh and use a multi-button mouse like the Alto and the NLS system did. Engelbart's influence peaked at the conference, and he was mostly remembered throughout the 1970s and much of the 1980s as the inventor of the mouse and hypertext, famously adapted by Apple and Microsoft. On the demo's 30th anniversary in 1998, Stanford University held a major conference to celebrate Engelbart's visionary impact on computing and the World Wide Web. By the time the 40th anniversary was celebrated, Engelbart's demo was acknowledged as one of the most important in computer history.

In most cases, only purebred animals recorded with a breed registry are eligible to enter and compete. A judge or team of judges will evaluate individual animals both in terms of the correct conformation for the species and the specific phenotypical characteristics of the given animal's breed. Breed shows are held for many domesticated animals, including companion animals such as cats and dogs, but also for livestock such as cattle, sheep and horses. In some cases, shows for many different breeds of animals may be combined in a single event, as in a dog show, were different classes exist for each breed, or, particularly in the case of livestock shows, competition or multiple species of animals may be combined into a single event, such as a county fair, thus allowing organizers to combine fixed costs for common areas such as barns, show rings and the like. In the case of horses, horse shows limited to a specific breed are very common, and generally include not only the conformation judging common to all animals, but also add performance classes where the animals are either ridden or shown in harness to display their training and underlying athletic ability, manners and temperament. The types of events offered vary from breed to breed, depending on the form and function for which the breed developed. Judges for breed shows are usually certified by a recognized organization, sometimes for the adjudication of only one breed, but in some cases, judges may be qualified to evaluate multiple breeds of the same animal. In any case, judges need to have a vast amount of knowledge and experience and retain objectivity in spite of any personal preference.

Music history  The first music in Wyoming was played by various Native American tribes in the present-day U.S. state of Wyoming. European settlers later arrived, bringing with them harmonicas, flutes, fiddles, and guitars because these were relatively lightweight and easy to carry on the frontier. The military played a major role in the historical development of the music of Wyoming. Virtually all posts had a band, and many soldiers learned to play the bugle and served in the drum and bugle corps. Military music was often the most prominent source of entertainment in many parts of early colonial Wyoming. Outsider musician Moondog lived in Wyoming as a child. Pop punk band The Lillingtons were formed in Newcastle in 1995.

She was also a voice teacher. Biography The future opera star's father, Karl- August Lehmann, was a singer (Heldentenor) while her mother, Maria Theresia L√∂w (1809‚Äì1885), was a soprano. Her younger sister, Marie, also went on to become an operatic soprano. Her first lessons were from her mother, who had been a prima donna under Spohr at the Cassel opera. After singing small parts on the stage, for example in Mozart's Magic Flute at Prague in 1866, and studies under Heinrich Laube in Leipzig, Lehmann made her proper debut in 1870 in Berlin as a light soprano in Meyerbeer's Das Feldlager in Schlesien. She subsequently became so successful that she was appointed an Imperial Chamber Singer for life in 1876. Lehmann sang in the first Bayreuth Festival in 1876, singing in the first complete performances of The Ring Cycle as Woglinde and Helmwige. She performed in London in 1884, and appeared at the New York Metropolitan Opera in 1885‚Äì1899. Together with her Met colleagues Fischer, Alvary, Brandt, and Seidl, she helped to popularise Wagner's music in America. By remaining in America beyond the leave granted her by the Berlin Opera, she faced a ban following her return to Germany. After the personal intervention of the Emperor, the ban was lifted. She appeared at London's Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1899 and sang in Paris and Vienna in 1903 and 1909 respectively. In 1905, she sang at the Salzburg Festival, later becoming the festival's artistic director. Lehmann was also renowned as a Lieder singer. She continued to give recitals until her retirement from the concert stage in the 1920s. Her mature voice, of splendid quality and large volume, gained for her the reputation of being not only one of the greatest Wagnerian singers of her day but also an ideal interpreter of Bellini's Norma and the operatic music of Mozart. She was considered unsurpassed in the roles of Br√ºnnhilde and Isolde but sang an astonishingly wide array of other parts. Indeed, across the span of her career, she performed 170 different parts in a total of 119 German, Italian and French operas. She was noted not only for her rendering of the musical score, but also as a tragic actress. She was also a noted voice teacher. Among her pupils were the famous sopranos Geraldine Farrar, Viorica Ursuleac, Edytha Fleischer, Olive Fremstad and the mezzo-sopranos Lula Mysz- Gmeiner and Marion Telva. Longtime Juilliard School professor of voice Lucia Dunham, who trained many other famous singers, was also one of her pupils. In 1888, she married the tenor Paul Kalisch. Portrait with signature, 1903 Lehmann founded the International Summer Academy at the Mozarteum in Salzburg in 1916. The academy's curriculum concentrated on voice lessons at first but it was extended later to include a wide variety of musical instruction. The Lilli Lehmann Medal is awarded by the Mozarteum in her honour. Her voice can be heard on CD reissues of the recordings which she made prior to World War I. Although past her peak as an operatic singer when she made these records, they still impress. Publications * Meine Gesangskunst. Berlin: 1902. 3rd Edition, 1922. * How to sing.

Life and work Bastien-Lepage was born in the village of Damvillers, Meuse, and spent his childhood there. Bastien's father grew grapes in a vineyard to support the family. His grandfather also lived in the village; his garden had fruit trees of apple, pear, and peach up against the high walls. Bastien took an early liking to drawing, and his parents fostered his creativity by buying prints of paintings for him to copy. =Education= Auguste Rodin, Jules Bastien- Lepage, 1887, on display at the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts on the Stanford University campus in Stanford, California Jules Bastien- Lepage's first teacher was his father, himself an artist. His first formal training was at Verdun. Prompted by a love of art, he went to Paris in 1867, where he was admitted to the √âcole des Beaux-arts, working under Cabanel. He was awarded first place for drawing, but spent most of his time working alone, only occasionally appearing in class. Nevertheless, he completed three years at the √©cole. In a letter to his parents, he complained that the life model was a man in the pose of a mediaeval lutanist. During the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, Bastien fought and was wounded. After the war, he returned home to paint the villagers and recover from his wound. In 1873 he painted his grandfather in the garden, a work that would bring the artist his first success at the Paris Salon. =Early work= After exhibiting works in the Salons of 1870 and 1872, which attracted no attention, in 1874 his Portrait of my Grandfather garnered critical acclaim and received a third-class medal. He also showed Song of Spring, an academically oriented study of rural life, representing a peasant girl sitting on a knoll above a village, surrounded by wood nymphs. His initial success was confirmed in 1875 by the First Communion, a picture of a little girl minutely worked up in manner that was compared to Hans Holbein, and a Portrait of M. Hayern. In 1875, he took second place in the competition for the Prix de Rome with his Angels appearing to the Shepherds, exhibited again at the Exposition Universelle in 1878. His next attempt to win the Prix de Rome in 1876 with Priam at the Feet of Achilles was again unsuccessful (it is in the Lille gallery), and the painter determined to return to country life.In an obituary in The Magazine of Art (1890), his friend, Prince Bojidar Karageorgevitch, wrote that it was never his intention to go to Rome, where the classical training held no interest for him, but winning the prize was a great honor which he had hoped would be his. To the Salon of 1877 he sent a full-length Portrait of Lady L. and My Parents; and in 1878 a Portrait of M. Theuriet and Haymaking (Les Foins). The last picture, now in the Mus√©e d'Orsay, was widely praised by critics and the public alike. It secured his status as one of the first painters in the Naturalist school. All Souls' Day, c. 1882 = Naturalism and acclaim = After the success of Haymaking, Bastien-Lepage was recognized in France as the leader of the emerging Naturalist school. By 1883, a critic could proclaim that \\"The whole world paints so much today like M. Bastien-Lepage that M. Bastien-Lepage seems to paint like the whole world.\\" This fame brought him prominent commissions. Portrait of Sarah Bernhardt, 1879 His Portrait of Mlle Sarah Bernhardt (1879), painted in a light key, won him the cross of the Legion of Honour. In 1879 he was commissioned to paint the Prince of Wales. In 1880 he exhibited a small portrait of M. Andrieux and Joan of Arc listening to the Voices (now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art); and in the same year, at the Royal Academy, the little portrait of the Prince of Wales. In 1881 he painted The Beggar and the Portrait of Albert Wolf; in 1882 Le P√®re Jacques; in 1885 Love in a Village, in which we find some trace of Gustave Courbet's influence. His last dated work is The Forge (1884). =Death and legacy= Self-portrait drawn a few days before his death Between 1880 and 1883 he traveled in Italy. The artist, long ailing, had tried in vain to re-establish his health in Algiers. He died in Paris in 1884, when planning a new series of rural subjects. His friend, Prince Bojidar Karageorgevitch,William et les gar√ßons (d‚ÄôEurope centrale) (William and the Boys (of Central Europe)) by Xavier Galmiche, Universit√© Paris Sorbonne et CIRCE . was with him at the end and wrote: > At last he was unable to work anymore; and he died on the 10th of December, > 1884, breathing his last in my arms. At his grave's head his mother and > brother planted an apple-tree. In March and April 1885, more than 200 of his pictures were exhibited at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In 1889 some of his best-known work was shown at the Paris Exposition Universelle. Among his more important works, may also be mentioned the portrait of Mme J. Drouet (1883); Gambetta on his death-bed, and some landscapes; The Vintage (1880), and The Thames at London (1882). The Little Chimney-Sweep was never finished. A museum is devoted to him at Montm√©dy. A statue of Bastien-Lepage by Rodin was erected in Damvillers.The Prince Bojidar Karageorgevitch, Personal reminiscences of Jules Bastien- Lepage, The Magazine of Art, Vol. 13, p. 83 (1890) Cassell & Company. An obituary by Prince Bojidar Karageorgevitch, appeared in the Magazine of Art (Cassell) in 1890. =Impact on the reception of Impressionism= The influential English critic Roger Fry credited the wider public's acceptance of the Impressionists, especially Claude Monet, to Bastien-Lepage. In his 1920 Essay in √Üsthetics, Fry wrote:Fry, Roger. 1920. \\"Vision and Design\\". London: Chatto & Windus. \\"An Essay in √Üsthetics\\". 11‚Äì24. Relationship with Marie Bashkirtseff Ukrainian-born painter Marie Bashkirtseff formed a close friendship with Bastien-Lepage. Artistically, she took her cue from the French painter's admiration for nature: \\"I say nothing of the fields because Bastien- Lepage reigns over them as a sovereign; but the streets, however, have not still had their...

He is considered a pioneer in TV news. He served as anchor of the NBC Nightly News from 1970 to 1982 and continued to do editorials and commentaries for NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw until 1993. Early career Chancellor attended the University of Illinois Navy Pier campus, completing the last two years of instruction at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1949. Originally a copy boy at 14 for the Chicago Daily News and hired in 1947 to be a reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times, he started his career in local television in Chicago, eventually turning to national television news as a correspondent on NBC's evening newscast, the Huntley-Brinkley Report. Frank Blair and Edwin Newman in The Today Show, 1961. Chancellor covered issues of national importance while on The Huntley-Brinkley Report. Chancellor covered the 1957 integration of the Little Rock Central High School, where a young Black girl, Elizabeth Eckford, wanted to attend an integrated school. Chancellor's coverage showed the white mob that surrounded her. After Chancellor began to cover the Little Rock story, segregationists followed him around town, growing increasingly angry. Chancellor did not run. Instead, he just kept walking and doing his reporting, despite the angry crowds around him. Chancellor spent a number of years as a foreign correspondent in Europe, with postings in Vienna, London, Moscow, and Brussels (NATO Headquarters). In July 1961, Chancellor replaced Dave Garroway as host of NBC's Today program, a role he filled for fourteen months. Never comfortable with the soft news focus of Today, Chancellor asked for, and was granted, a release from his contract with the show in the summer of 1962. He left the program in September, and assumed a role as political correspondent for NBC News. He, Frank McGee, Edwin Newman, and Sander Vanocur comprised a team that covered the national political conventions in the 1960s so well, they were dubbed by industry observers as the \\"Four Horsemen.\\" At the 1964 Republican National Convention, he was arrested for refusing to cede his spot on the floor to \\"Goldwater Girls,\\" supporters of the Republican presidential candidate, Barry Goldwater. When security came to get him, he was forced to sign off: \\"I've been promised bail, ladies and gentlemen, by my office. This is John Chancellor, somewhere in custody.\\" He then became the director of the Voice of America in 1965, at the request of President Lyndon Johnson, a spot he held until 1967.  NBC Nightly News  Chancellor returned to NBC in 1968 as senior correspondent on the Huntley Brinkley Report and, two years later when Chet Huntley retired, Chancellor stepped in to anchor the broadcast, renamed NBC Nightly News, a spot he held from 1970 to 1982; this job became the defining point of his career. Inaugurating the name and setting the pace of the format of Nightly News, from 1970 to 1971, Chancellor, along with David Brinkley and Frank McGee, was one of three anchors who rotated in a co-anchor duo format, held over from Huntley-Brinkley. NBC arranged the rotation by having McGee always broadcast from New York City and Brinkley continue at his customary Washington desk. If McGee did not anchor on a broadcast, Chancellor did from New York; if Brinkley did not, Chancellor filled in from Washington. NBC did not have separate weekend anchors during this period, as it had just inaugurated a Sunday evening newscast in August 1970, so this format was employed seven days a week. A perceived lack of stability in this arrangement prompted NBC to go with Chancellor full-time (McGee later moved to The Today Show). From August 9, 1971 to June 4, 1976, Chancellor became the sole weeknight anchor (Garrick Utley and others took over weekend duties), stationed at the New York NBC headquarters, with Brinkley reduced to contributing pre-recorded commentaries, titled David Brinkley's Journal, about two to three times per week from Washington. Facing the continued popularity of top-rated CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, NBC Nightly News returned to a co-anchor format from June 7, 1976 until October 9, 1979 with Brinkley resuming his old role at the NBC Washington desk; internal disputes within NBC management prompted the network to remove Brinkley from Nightly News, assigning him to occasional documentaries until his departure for ABC in 1981. Although Chancellor was a respected, well-spoken journalist and noted author in his own right, his broadcast ratings were eclipsed by Walter Cronkite in the 1970s, when CBS Evening News had become the most popular of the three network weeknight broadcasts. Toward the end of Chancellor's tenure, ABC, for the first time ever, became competitive with NBC and CBS with its World News Tonight. =\\"Red\\" and \\"blue\\" state concept= Chancellor has the distinction of creating the idea of using colors to represent the states won by presidential candidates in presidential elections. For the 1976 presidential election Chancellor suggested to his network's engineers that they create a large electronic map of the United States and place it in the network's election-night news studio. If Jimmy Carter, the Democratic candidate, won a state it would light up in red; if Gerald Ford, the Republican candidate, carried a state it would light up in blue. Chancellor, when asked about the color scheme, sought to tie the British Labour's red to the American Democrats; British Conservatives using blue as their ribbon color. By 2000, all the traditional broadcast networks had adopted the present model, though with the colors switched; red for Republicans (as both begin with the same letter), and blue for Democrats.

The suffering and misery he saw there are reflected in his late sculptures such as Fallen Man (1915‚Äì16).Wilhelm Lehmbruck Tate. He suffered from severe depression and fled the war by going to Z√ºrich at the end of 1916. There he made contact with the socialist, L. Rubiner, who collaborated on Franz Pfemfert's Aktion.Wilhelm Lehmbruck Museum of Modern Art, New York. He was elected to the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin in early 1919. After the war he returned to Berlin where he committed suicide on March 25, 1919.  Sculptures  Lehmbruck's sculptures mostly concentrate on the human body and are influenced by Naturalism and Expressionism. His works, including female nudes, are marked by a sense of melancholy and an elongation of form common to Gothic architecture. Throughout his career, architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe placed his friend Lehmbruck's sculptures and those of Aristide Maillol into his buildings and designs.Barcelona Pavilion.

Shardik is his second novel, and first of two novels set in the fictional Beklan Empire. Events revolve around the discovery, capture and military and symbolic uses made of an incredibly large bear, called Lord Shardik by those who subscribe to a set of religious beliefs in the novel. Plot When a tremendous fire ravages a forest, a bear twice as tall as a man flees to the river island of Ortelga, and is found exhausted by Kelderek, a hunter who thinks the bear may be Lord Shardik, \\"the Power of God\\", returned to his worshippers. Kelderek shares his belief with the local barons and priestesses. The Ortelgans once ruled the Beklan Empire. Against the wishes of the Tuginda, the high priestess, a military campaign is launched to retake Bekla. The bear is sedated, caged, and carried to the campaign, awakening and breaking free in the middle of a battle which they are losing. Shardik's attack demoralises the enemy and the opposing army is routed. Shardik's worship is restored to central prominence in Bekla with Kelderek as priest-king. Five years into his rule, Bekla remains at war and there is discontent, particularly over the Ortelgans' expansion of legal slavery. When the bear escapes and flees again, Kelderek alone follows in pursuit. The two of them stagger through the wilderness for a long time, both of them on the brink of starvation and madness, meeting many foes along the way. Kelderek loses both ability and desire to continue, having lost his faith. Finally reaching Zeray, a lawless town beyond the borders of civilisation, he re-encounters the Tuginda and Melathys, a former priestess of Shardik, and the two fall in love. Kelderek is captured by Genshed, an unlicensed slave-trader with a large group of children, whom he delights in tormenting. Genshed is fleeing from insurrection forces who despise the slave trade, and many children do not survive the march. Genshed is on the point of killing Kelderek despite knowing his prisoner's value as the former ruler of Bekla, when the dying Shardik erupts from the woods. The bear attacks Genshed, mortally wounding him before collapsing dead in the river. Kelderek, his faith restored, returns to the town of Zeray with the children and is appointed its governor by Bekla's new rulers. Some years later, the town is now the home of so many orphans that children outnumber adults by two to one, and work in this society much like adults. Shardik's death is perceived as sacred and a sign that all children are to be valued. Kelderek and Methalys are married with two children of their own, beginning trade negotiations with an emissary from the distant kingdom of Zakalon. Characters Shardik - An enormous bear more than twice as tall as a man, with huge curved claws longer than a man's head. Shardik first appears in the opening chapters, when a forest fire forces him out of the wild lands north of the River Telthearna onto the island of Ortelga. Unlike the animals in Adams' earlier book Watership Down, Shardik does not speak or appear to have conscious thought, and apart from the opening sequence the story is not told from his perspective. Kelderek (also called Crendrik by non-Ortelgans) - The main protagonist, an Ortelgan hunter and later priest-king of the Beklan empire, and finally governor of Zeray. Often nicknamed Zenzuata (\\"Play-With-The-Children\\") as he seldom socialises with other people his age but instead prefers to play with the children. It is he who first sees the enormous bear, setting in motion the events which lead to the Ortelgans taking Bekla and himself being crowned king. The Tuginda - High priestess of Ortelga, she opposes the capture of Shardik for the purposes of aiding the conquest of Bekla, and so is made a prisoner on the island of Quiso by Ta-Komininion (an act to which Kelderek is grudgingly complicit). Melathys - A priestess second in authority to the Tuginda, who flees and abandons her position at the sight of Shardik but redeems herself later. Bel-ka-Trazet - High Baron of the Ortelgans when Shardik is first discovered, and later ruler of the lawless outpost of Zeray. He is a pragmatic ruler and a rational man. He was disfigured by a bear when he was a young hunter. Ta-Kominion - A charismatic young baron who usurps power from Bel-ka-Trazet and directs the campaign to take Bekla for the Ortelgans in its early stages and orders the Tuginda to be taken in chains when she disagrees with using Shardik. Elleroth - Ban of Sarkid, in the southern province of Yelda, outwardly loyal to the Ortelgans, but working for the rebel general Santil-k√®-Erketlis. His son is taken by Genshed as a slave, fuelling his resentment of Ortelgan rule. Genshed - Sadistic child slaver who has Elleroth's son in his service.  Setting  Rafael Palacios. Shardik takes place in the Beklan Empire, which consists of twelve vassal provinces and independent domains organized around the central Beklan province, at the centre of which is the empire's capital, Bekla. The capital is typically controlled by factions from one of the provinces, and the outermost provinces continuously threaten to break free. The lingua franca of the empire is the Beklan language. The subdivisions are Bekla (the capital), Belishba, Chalcon, Gelt, Lapan, Kabin of the Waters, Ortelga, Paltesh, Tonilda, Ur-tah, Yelda, and Sarkid of the Sheaves.  Related works  Adams later wrote the loose prequel Maia, a novel that takes place in and around Bekla about a dozen years earlier. Several characters from Shardik appear as minor characters in Maia, e.g. Melathys and Genshed. Influence The bear Guardian in Stephen King's The Dark Tower series is named for this Shardik.

The organisation dates to 1760. Its stated aims are to enhance the safety of life, property, and the environment, by helping its clients (including by validation, certification, and accreditation) to ensure the quality construction and operation of critical infrastructure. Historically, as Lloyd's Register of Shipping, it was a specifically maritime organisation. During the late 20th century, it diversified into other industries including oil and gas, process industries, nuclear, and rail. Through its 100% subsidiary Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance Ltd (LRQA), it is also a major vendor of independent assessment services, including management systems certification for quality certification to ISO9001, ISO14001 and OSHAS18001. Lloyd's Register is unaffiliated with Lloyd's of London. In July 2012, the organisation converted from an industrial and provident society to a company limited by shares, named Lloyd‚Äôs Register Group Limited, with the new Lloyd‚Äôs Register Foundation as the sole shareholder. At the same time the organisation gave to the Foundation a substantial bond and equity portfolio to assist it with its charitable purposes. It will benefit from continued funding from the group‚Äôs operating arm, Lloyd‚Äôs Register Group Limited. Origin The organisation was named after a 17th-century coffee house in London that was frequented by merchants, marine underwriters, and others, all men associated with shipping. The coffee house owner, Edward Lloyd, helped them to exchange information by circulating a printed sheet of all the news he heard. In 1760, the Register Society was formed by the customers of the coffee house who assembled the Register of Shipping, the first known register of its type. Between 1800 and 1833, a dispute between shipowners and underwriters resulted in each group publishing a list‚Äîthe \\"Red Book\\" and the \\"Green Book\\".Michael Palmer, Lloyd's Register of Shipping, online, read 29 October 2011 Both parties came to the verge of bankruptcy. They reached agreement in 1834 to unite and form Lloyd‚Äôs Register of British and Foreign Shipping, establishing a General Committee and charitable values. In 1914, with an increasingly international outlook, the organisation changed its name to Lloyd's Register of Shipping. The Register The Society printed the first Register of Ships in 1764 in order to give both underwriters and merchants an idea of the condition of the vessels they insured and chartered: ship hulls were graded by a lettered scale (A being the best), and ship's fittings (masts, rigging, and other equipment) were graded by number (1 being the best). Thus the best classification \\"A1\\", from which the expression A1 or A1 at Lloyd's is derived, first appeared in the 1775‚Äì76 edition of the Register. The Register, with information on all seagoing, self-propelled merchant ships of 100 gross tonnes or greater, is published annually. A vessel remains registered with Lloyd's Register until she is sunk, wrecked, hulked, scrapped or withdrawn from the register by the vessels owner. The Register was published formerly by the joint venture company of Lloyd's Register-Fairplay, which was formed in July 2001 by the merger of Lloyd's Register's Maritime Information Publishing Group and Prime Publications Limited. Lloyd's Register sold its share of the venture to IHS Markit in 2009. Classification rules The Lloyd's Register load line on the hull of the Cutty Sark Lloyd's Register provides quality assurance and certification for ships, offshore structures, and shore-based installations such as power stations and railway infrastructure. However, Lloyd's Register is known best for the classification and certification of ships, and inspects and approves important components and accessories, including life-saving appliances, marine pollution prevention, fire protection, navigation, radio communication equipment, deck gear, cables, ropes, and anchors. =LR's Rules for Ships= LR's Rules for Ships are derived from principles of naval architecture and marine engineering, and govern safety and operational standards for numerous merchant, military, and privately owned vessels. LR's Rules govern a number of topics including: * Materials used for construction of the vessel * Ship structural requirements and minimum scantlings, depending on ship type * Operation and maintenance of main and auxiliary machinery * Operation and maintenance of emergency and control systems Specific editions of the rules are available to cater for merchant ships, naval ships, trimarans, special purpose vessels and offshore structures. A ship is known as being in class if she meets all the minimum requirements of LR's Rules, and such a status affects the possibility of a ship getting insurance. Class can be withdrawn from a ship if she is in violation of any regulations and does not maintain the minimum requirements specified by the company. However, exceptional circumstances may warrant special dispensation from Lloyd's Register. Any alteration to the vessel, whether it is a structural alteration or machinery, must be approved by Lloyd's Register before it is implemented. Ships are inspected on a regular basis by a team of Lloyd's Register surveyors, one of the most important inspections being a ship's load line survey ‚Äì due once every five years. Such a survey includes an inspection of the hull to make sure that the load line has not been altered. Numerous other inspections such as the condition of hatch and door seals, safety barriers, and guard rails are also performed. Upon completion the ship is allowed to be operated for another year, and is issued a load line certificate.  Rules and regulations  Lloyd‚Äôs Register provide a list of rules and regulations to the public.

Influence in Austria In 1833 the √ñsterreichischer Lloyd (\\"Austrian Lloyd\\") company was formed in the then-Austrian port city of Trieste, consciously modeling itself on the British company and seeking to publish a similar register.

However, she shone in the uneven bars event final, where her challenging routine helped her win a gold medal over a tough field with numerous Olympic and world champions, including Svetlana Khorkina (who took an infamous fall from the apparatus, which she traditionally dominated) and 2002 World Champion Courtney Kupets. Her medal marked the first ever for a French female gymnast. Le Pennec continued to train and compete after the Olympics. In 2005, she earned two medals at the European Championships: gold on uneven bars and bronze on floor. She also qualified to the all-around finals in first place, but lost any chance for a medal when she fell during her balance beam routine. Le Pennec also competed in the 2005 World Championships in Melbourne, but mistakes prevented her from medalling. One of Le Pennec's competitive uneven bars routine was considered to be one of the most technically difficult in the world. In it, she completed a Def (a Gienger release move with a full twist), an element classified at the top difficulty level, Super-E, in the 2005 Code of Points. Le Pennec also performed a double-twisting double back tuck salto dismount. Le Pennec missed the 2006 European Championships to concentrate on schoolwork. Later, recuperating from an Achilles' tendon injury and acting on the advice of her doctors, she sat out of the 2006 World Championships. On 27 September 2007, she announced via a press releasePress release : √âmilie Le Pennec puts an end to her career that she had put an end to her career, mainly after failing to retrieve her level after her multiple injuries in 2006‚Äì2007, the latest being a heel injury contracted during the Vittel international match in August 2007. Olympic Bars Routine: Jump to the low bar immediately to the high bar; hop with full turn; Def (Gienger with 1.5 turn); full pirouette into overshoot to handstand down to the low bar into toe shoot to high bar; double-twisting double back tuck somersault. (S.V: 10.0)  Later life  During the 2008 Summer Olympics, she worked as a consultant for the French TV Canal+. After she retired from gymnastics, Le Pennec studied to become a physical therapist. She practices in Paris.

The station's studios are in lower Manhattan and are shared with co- owned WNYM (970 AM). WMCA's transmitter is located along Belleville Turnpike in Kearny, New Jersey.Site visit to WMCA Kearny facility WMCA's programming is simulcast on a 250 watt translator, W272DX (102.3 MHz), from a tower in Clifton, New Jersey. Prior to switching to its current programming in 1989, WMCA was a talk radio station during the 1970s and 1980s, and earlier a Top 40 outlet featuring a lineup of disc jockeys known as the \\"Good Guys.\\" WMCA is credited with having been the first New York radio station to broadcast a recording by The Beatles. History = Early years = After first testing as station 2XH, WMCA began regular transmissions on February 1, 1925, broadcasting on 428.6 meters wavelength (700 kHz) with a power of 500 watts. It was the 13th radio station to begin operations in New York City and was owned by broadcasting pioneer Donald Flamm. The station's original studios and antenna were located at the Hotel McAlpin, located on Herald Square and from which the WMCA call sign derives.And not, as is sometimes thought, from the Music Corporation of America (now known as NBCUniversal for non-music businesses, and Universal Music Group in the music industry), which has never owned this station. In 1928 it moved to the 570 kHz frequency, sharing time for the next three years with municipally-owned WNYC. On April 19, 1932, the Federal Radio Commission approved WMCA's application to broadcast full-time on 570 kHz. In December 1940, Flamm had to surrender the station to industrialist Edward J. Noble, who had just resigned as Undersecretary of Commerce, in a transaction involving prominent political figures including Thomas Corcoran. Flamm's subsequent legal battle against Noble resulted in a congressional investigation and eventually ended in a financial settlement, though not the return of the station. Through its early decades, WMCA had a varied programming history, playing music, hosting dramas, and broadcasting New York Giants baseball games. In 1943, it was acquired by the Straus family when Edward J. Noble acquired the Blue Network and its owned-and-operated stations from NBC, including WJZ in New York; the Blue Network would later be renamed the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). In 1945, host Barry Gray began dropping music and adding talk with celebrities and later call-ins from listeners. Gray is sometimes considered \\"The Father of Talk Radio,\\" and his show lasted on WMCA through several decades and format changes. WMCA began playing hit music in the late 1950s with a Top 40 format. Among its disc jockey staff were Scott Muni, Frankie Crocker, Harry Harrison and Murray the K. = Good Guys era = The WMCA \\"Good Guys\\" c. 1964: Joe O'Brien, Harry Harrison, Jack Spector, Dan Daniel, B. Mitchel Reed and Johnny Dark. In 1960, WMCA began promoting itself by stressing its on-air personalities, who were collectively known as the Good Guys. The station was led by program director Ruth Meyer, the first woman to hold the position in New York City radio. This was the era of the high-profile, fast-talking Top 40 disc jockey with an exuberant personality aimed at a youthful audience. With the advent of the Good Guys format, WMCA saw its ratings increase and become known for \\"playing the hits.\\" In the early 1960s, the top 40 format was still young, and the field was crowded in New York City. Two major 50,000-watt stations, WMGM and WINS, had battled each other, playing the top hits for several years. Then in 1960, WABC joined the fray and started featuring top 40 music. Ultimately, it was WMCA's earnest competition with rival WABC that forced WMGM (in early 1962) and then WINS (in spring 1965) to abandon the top-40 format. There was so much attention on the high-profile WMCA-WABC battle that WMGM and WINS were forced to find a new niche. The classic Good Guys era lineup included: *Joe O'Brien, an industry veteran whose humor appealed to multiple generations. (6am-10am) *Harry Harrison, whose show was aimed at housewives of that era. (10am-1pm) *Jack Spector, whose closing line was \\"Look out street, here I come!\\" (1pm-4pm) *Dandy Dan Daniel a lanky, smooth-talking Texan, and his daily countdown. (4pm-7pm) *Gary Stevens and his \\"Wooleyburger\\" bear, aimed at teenagers listening on small transistor radios in their rooms. (7pm-11pm - First show was in April, 1965) *B. Mitchel Reed, \\"BMR, Your Leader\\" Reed was the evening personality on WMCA from 1963‚Äì1965. He was part of the team that took WMCA to the top in 1963. He left the station in the spring of 1965, to return to L.A.'s troubled KFWB, where he had worked before WMCA. His on-air hours were the same as Gary Stevens. *Barry Gray, a talk show host who had been on WMCA before the Top 40 era and continued after it. (11pm-1am) *Dean Anthony, \\"Dino on your radio\\" with his \\"Actors and Actresses\\" game (1am-6am). *Weekends and fill-in, Ed Baer, Frank Stickle and Bill Beamish. *Owner R. Peter Straus was one of the first station owners to frequently read editorials, commenting on current events. Straus was an active owner. In an on-air editorial, he endorsed John F. Kennedy for President in 1960. He also wrote and read the first broadcast editorial calling for the impeachment of Pres. Richard Nixon. In 1961, Straus and WMCA filed a lawsuit charging that the state legislature was violating the Constitution by giving rural areas disproportionate representation. That suit, combined with others, led to the Supreme Court of the United States 1964 \\"one man, one vote\\" decision. During the later talk era, Straus would sometimes go on the air to take listener questions and comments about the radio station. On Friday nights, Gary Stevens ended at 10:30 and WMCA's locally produced, half-hour news show The World Tonite aired. This was a local recap of the week's news, and should not be confused with Garner Ted Armstrong's The World Tomorrow religious program, which was heard on WMCA after the Good Guys era ended. Dan Daniel's countdown changed each week and consisted of the station's top 25 records. It also included a \\"Sure Shot\\" and \\"Long Shot\\" of records not yet on the chart. He also gave away his \\"Hit Kit\\" every day to a listener who had been chosen from postcards sent to the station. The \\"Hit Kit\\" consisted of a copy of each of the Top 25 records of the week. To claim this prize, listeners had to call in when they heard their name read on the air. = The Beatles = On December 26, 1963, WMCA, with Jack Spector as the DJ, earned the distinction of being the first New York City radio station to play the Beatles' Capitol Records' single, \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\". (Outside New York, the song's broadcast debut in America is widely accepted to have occurred earlier at WWDC in Washington, D.C.) There is no evidence that any New York City radio station played the Beatles before December 1963 despite the fact that the band's first singles had been released earlier, without fanfare, by smaller, resource- challenged labels (Vee-Jay Records and Swan Records). However, according to one account, rival Top 40 outlet WINS \\"reportedly\\" played the band's Swan Records single \\"She Loves You\\" on September 28, 1963, as part of a listener's poll. After the song finished last (third place), it was quickly dropped from the station's playlist. WMCA was keen on playing new product and breaking new hits, and consequently, it became the radio station most credited for introducing Beatlemania, and the subsequent \\"British Invasion\\" musical movement to New Yorkers. While network-owned WABC was busy broadcasting New York Mets baseball games in the summer of 1963, family-owned WMCA was the music-intensive station that one would hear coming out of transistor radios at pools and beaches. Starting in 1963, the WMCA's Good Guys soared to the top of New York City's Arbitron ratings. WMCA also was known for its on-air production and promotions. Each hour, WMCA presented its music, jingles, promotions, contests, stagers and commercials in a tight, upbeat fast-paced style. Some radio industry veterans attribute WABC's \\"stodgy sound\\" to standards applied by its corporate ownership and to its staff of longtime (and older) studio engineers. This fueled speculation that independently-owned WMCA had younger, more \\"hip\\" board-operators with a better understanding of the top 40 format aimed at younger adults. Whatever the reason, the \\"sparkling sound\\" presented on-air by WMCA also contributed to its ratings success in New York City, the largest radio market in the United States. WMCA's most famous promotions and contests involved the Beatles. Shortly after the band's arrival in the United States on February 7, 1964, WMCA was able to secure the Beatles' cooperation, recording several commercials promoting the station's \\"Good Guys.\\" Many believe this cooperation was directly linked to the band's awareness of WMCA being the first radio station in New York City to play \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" weeks earlier. According to industry observers, WMCA's success getting John Lennon and Ringo Starr to record several spots on behalf of WMCA convinced listeners that the station (along with WINS personality Murray the K, who called himself \\"The Fifth Beatle\\") had direct access to the group. This was despite the fact that during their first New York visit the band's movements were restricted to the Plaza Hotel, Central Park, CBS Studio 50 (where they appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show), the 21 Club, the Peppermint Lounge and Carnegie Hall. The WMCA \\"Good Guys\\"‚ÄìJohnny Dark, Joe O'Brien, Jack Spector, B. Mitchel Reed, Harry Harrison ‚Äì with the Beatles in the Baroque Room at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, February 10, 1964. (Photo by Popsie Randolph) In February 1964, WMCA held a contest for a chance to win a lock of hair belonging to Ringo Starr. It received nearly 90,000 entries. The lock of hair, and a runner-up prize of a photograph on a fan club card signed by all four members of the Beatles, were obtained directly from the group during marathon \\"one-on-one\\" meetings and a reception held with print and broadcast personnel at Plaza Hotel on February 10. Other runner-up prizes distributed by WMCA that were not directly handled by the Beatles included 1,000 specially made WMCA paper record sleeves picturing the Good Guys, containing the band's single, \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\", as well as $57.00 in cash, reminding listeners of WMCA's spot on the radio dial. Contrary to some accounts, the enormous number of entries received by WMCA, an estimated 86,000 cards, letters, and packages, were from Beatle fans seeking only to obtain the lock of Starr's hair. For this \\"Good Guy-Ringo Starr Contest\\" (better known today as the \\"Beatles' Wig Contest\\") WMCA's listeners were encouraged to send in a drawing or picture of a person wearing a Beatles' wig. The winning entry from Roberta Corrigan (who won the lock of hair) featured a huge image of Queen Elizabeth II with a Beatles wig on her head, along with several other images including one of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill wearing the same, all submitted in a book with captions for each. Runner-up winner Stella Scuotto of Brooklyn won the photograph of the Beatles on a fan club card signed by all four members of the band at the Plaza Hotel. According to Beatles' historian Bruce Spizer, Kay Smith was also a runner-up winner, winning $57 and the rare record sleeve for \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\", featuring a picture of WMCA's Good Guys. WMCA continued to beat other radio stations on many Beatles' promotions, scoring firsts, causing headaches in particular for rival WABC, most notably when Capitol Records printed a photograph of the \\"Good Guys\\" line-up on the back of a limited edition record sleeve for the single, \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" (Side 2: \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\"). WMCA's Good Guys were also featured at both of the Beatles' concerts at Shea Stadium on August 15, 1965 and on August 23, 1966. WABC responded in different ways, scoring a major success during the Beatles' second New York visit in August 1964 when the band stayed at the Delmonico Hotel, rousing thousands of teenage fans into a frenzy while broadcasting from one floor above the Beatles' rooms. WABC later went against its own music policies, promising promoter Sid Bernstein that it would play a new group he was handling before any other New York City radio station if it could get exclusive access to the Beatles. WABC never added records \\"out of the box,\\" but it did for Bernstein when it played The Young Rascals' \\"I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore\\" before other radio stations. WABC also had a source in London able to provide the station with many British releases that were not yet available in the United States or to the other New York radio stations and thus were played exclusively on WABC for at least a few days to a couple of weeks. Since WABC knew WMCA already had a relationship with the Beatles, WABC devised clever ways to one-up its competitor. In August 1965, WABC came up with its own special promotion, issuing \\"medals\\" called \\"The Order of the All- Americans\\" which was the name given to WABC's DJ line up. It intended to present the medals to each of the Beatles when the group next returned to New York. The goal was to get each Beatle to comment on the \\"medal\\" and then to get each to say the station's call letters, \\"W-A-B-C\\", which could then be used in station identification and on-air promos. The station got its interviews, but none of the band's members would utter WABC's call letters. According to Beatles' historian Bruce Spizer, manager Brian Epstein ordered the Beatles to stop \\"giving away valuable promotional spots to radio stations for free.\\". Ultimately, the WMCA-WABC (and to an extent WINS) competition for Beatles releases and promotions is considered to be one of the greatest radio \\"battles\\" in medium's history. Apart from its link to the Beatles, WMCA saturated its programming with many other promotions and on-air games. They included \\"Name It and Claim It,\\" with the most desired prize being one of the station's yellow \\"Good Guys\\" sweatshirts, which were designed by WMCA program director Ruth Meyer. The sweatshirts could be won if a listener's name was read over the air and that listener called PLaza 2-9944 within a certain time period. Another distinctive feature of WMCA was its \\"Call For Action\\" Help Line (PLaza 9-1717), which listeners could call if they had any problems requiring WMCA's help resolving, usually consumer or public works service- related issues. = Competition with WABC = In the 1960s, WMCA's great competition was with rival WABC. Radio historians have tended to treat WMCA as a radio stepchild, the proverbial David going up against the Goliath that was corporate-owned, stronger-signaled WABC. For four consecutive years (1963 through 1966) WMCA had the highest ratings share of all radio stations in New York City, according to Arbitron, in spite of its directional, 5,000-watt signal which could not cover the same geographic region as non-directional, 50,000-watt WABC. However, WMCA's directional signal is aimed right into Manhattan from just over the river in New Jersey, and its low frequency (570 kHz) results in strong Midtown Manhattan coverage. At the time, Arbitron was the newer and lesser quoted ratings source compared to the more established Pulse and Hooper Ratings. During this time frame, Pulse and Hooper usually placed adult full-service WOR as the overall number-one station, with WMCA generally but not always leading WABC and WINS as the Top 40 leader. WMCA's ratings strength was concentrated within New York City itself. However, WABC proved more popular in suburban areas where WMCA's signal didn't come in as well on standard 1960s-era AM radio receivers. The areas where WMCA did not have a strong signal were southwest, west, and northwest of its transmitter. By 1967 and 1968, WMCA ratings had started to decline significantly but still demonstrated a strong showing in the five boroughs (although not the suburbs), and as late as February 1969, Pulse ratings surveys indicated that WMCA beat WABC in New York City itself, although not in the full market. From 1967 forward, WABC had become the leading top 40 station in the total market. In addition to its ratings strength, between 1964 and 1968, Billboard magazine rated WMCA as New York's most influential station for new records. Although every market had one station with record-buying influence, WMCA was in the top market, making it responsible for some songs becoming hits nationwide. Not every record added to the WMCA playlist became a hit, but as soon as sales stirred, WABC, with a shorter playlist of hits, would be forced to add the same record. With its longer playlist, WMCA played new records faster than rival WABC. WMCA's weekly countdown list was 25 records, compared with WABC's 20 song list. WMCA's included the \\"Sure Shot\\" and \\"Long Shot\\" speculations. WMCA's countdown was also \\"faster\\" than WABC's, in the sense that records climbed to the top more quickly, while WABC's rankings tended to lag behind. A comparison of both stations showed WABC to be up to two, sometimes three weeks behind WMCA. The WMCA-WABC rivalry was never more intense than when it came to fighting over the Beatles. WABC was frustrated with its efforts to gain ratings dominance in New York City's ratings and with its efforts to forge a stronger relationship with one of the world's most popular musical acts. WMCA program director Ruth Meyer would later speculate in interviews that WABC's creativity during the 1960s could have been hampered by being owned by an ABC network rife with nationwide broadcast policies, commitments and standards. Conversely, WMCA could run free with \\"goofy\\" ideas, promotions and gimmicks as an independently run, family-owned station, without network interference. According to WABC historians, \\"another success for WMCA was the fault of WABC itself.\\" In 1969, WABC overnight host Roby Yonge, upon learning his contract with the station was not going to be renewed, used his shift to spread rumors about the \\"death\\" of Paul McCartney. This episode proved to be an embarrassment for WABC, leading to Yonge's firing, and WABC's status as a network-owned, clear-channel station mistakenly launched the \\"Paul is dead\\" story across America and ultimately around the world. WMCA's ratings decline was due to several factors: the January 1968 split of the ABC Radio Network into four distinct components allowed WABC to drop Don McNeill's Breakfast Club and become fully music-intensive during the day. Around the same time Ruth Meyer exited WMCA, the station temporarily dropped the \\"Good Guy\\" branding and it also lost key personalities, including Harry Harrison, who moved over to WABC. Additionally, the ascendance of R&B; station WWRL in 1967 and of two FM rock stations ‚Äì WOR-FM in 1967 and WNEW-FM in 1968 ‚Äì all took ratings away from WMCA. = Transition = In 1968, a chaotic period began in which Gary Stevens relocated to Switzerland and Harry Harrison moved to WABC, where he replaced Herb Oscar Anderson as its morning host. WMCA then started experimenting with some talk programming as part of \\"Power Radio,\\" with hosts ranging from Domenic Quinn to countercultural Alex Bennett. The station also began playing album cuts in addition to singles, with the slogan \\"The hits and the Heavies.\\" As disc jockeys left, new DJs appeared with vague names (e.g., Lee Gray was originally \\"Lee Your Leader\\") and various stunts were performed. In one case, Frankie Crocker, who was lured away from WWRL as the station's first African-American personality, played two very short songs over and over again for an hour. The \\"Good Guys\\" were partly reassembled, then dropped again. Even reliable Dean Anthony, who was concurrently working at a country music station, sometimes got the slogans mixed up on air. = Talk era = The station finally adopted a full-time talk radio format in 1970, calling itself as \\"Dial-Log Radio.\\" The \\"Good Guys\\" music era was over, although the \\"Good Guy\\" theme eventually did make a comeback in a promotional marketing effort. When WMCA acquired New York Yankees baseball broadcast rights in 1971, DJ Jack Spector stayed on to host a sports talk show, while Bob Grant debuted in New York radio as the house conservative. \\"Long John\\" Nebel came over from WNBC in 1973 and became a fixture on overnights, accompanied by his co-host and spouse Candy Jones. Malachy McCourt hosted a Sunday night call-in show that was mostly personal reminisces of the type that later became the subject of the best-selling autobiography Angela's Ashes, by his brother Frank McCourt. In 1972, John Sterling succeeded Spector as sports talk host, transforming the program into one of the first confrontational sports talks shows, as well as doing play-by-play for New York Islanders hockey and New York Nets basketball games that were carried on WMCA. It was there that his knowledgeable and over- the-top broadcasting style would first be heard in the New York area. WMCA carried Yankees games until 1977. The station then held the broadcast rights for the New York Mets from 1978 through 1983. WMCA introduced a new morning news-talk program, hosted by Ralph Howard, Bill Ryan and a team of reporters who were all referred to as the \\"Good Guys,\\" as seen in this ad for the Ralph & Ryan show. During the 1970s, ratings were healthy for WMCA as a talk station. Jonathan King, who had been at the top of the Good Guys chart in 1965 with his single \\"Everyone's Gone To The Moon,\\" hosted the weekday midday show for a year in 1981. Most surveys showed the station in the top 10. This was before WOR became exclusively talk, and also before WABC changed to talk in the early 1980s. The Straus family sold WMCA around 1987. It was the last family-owned radio station in New York. New owner Federal Broadcasting kept the talk format, but switched to a financial news format on weekdays between 5:00 am and 7:00 pm, just prior to selling the station in April 1989 to Salem Communications, which already owned WWDJ since 1983. Salem immediately implemented a format that focused on religion and leased time programming.\\"In brief.\\" Broadcasting, April 10, 1989, pg. 96. At that time, all WMCA staffers were invited to apply for positions with the \\"new\\" WMCA. Federal Broadcasting eventually sold off all its stations and left the broadcasting business. =Christian era= Since September 16, 1989, WMCA has been airing a Christian talk and teaching format, as Salem Communications does in dozens of large and medium-sized cities across the U.S. Initially WMCA had the slogan \\"New York's Christian Radio.\\" That later changed to \\"New York's Inspiring Talk.\\" In the early 1990s, the moniker was \\"Together, we're sharing the moments of your day on WMCA...New York!\\". Salem retained just one of the on-air hosts from the talk years, financial advisor Sonny Bloch, who later ran into legal and tax problems. WMCA was Salem's primary religious station in New York, while the company also ran extra Christian programming on WWDJ. This second station was publicly billed as \\"WMCA II\\" or \\"WMCA 970\\" until its call letters were changed to WNYM and it adopted a Conservative talk radio format in 2008. During the mid-2000s, WMCA attempted to establish a connection back to its \\"Good Guys\\" era. The website had a tribute to the 1960s DJs, while the current air personalities‚Äî\\"a whole new team of 'Good Guys' filling the airwaves with the Good News\\"‚Äîmade appearances and gave out an updated version of the Good Guys sweatshirt. On air, the station used its 1960s-era \\"Good Guys\\" jingles for station identification, program promos and transition between songs when music was scheduled. This ended in January 2015 when WMCA was rechristened as The Mission, a new corporate branding effort also used on other Salem Christian stations. WMCA carries St. John's University basketball, sharing flagship responsibilities with WNYM. In September 2016, WMCA began airing United States Military Academy football. Additionally, WMCA airs Seton Hall University basketball contests which cannot air on WNYM due to scheduling conflicts; the Army, St. John's, and Seton Hall broadcasts are all provided by Learfield IMG College. The station carried a limited schedule of University at Buffalo football games in 2014 and 2015. = Studio locations and translator = After leaving the Hotel McAlpin in 1938, WMCA moved its studios to various locations in Midtown Manhattan, first to 888 Seventh Avenue and then to 1657 Broadway, and in November 1955 to 415 Madison Avenue, where it remained until it was sold.New York Times, November 22, 1955 Not long after taking control of WMCA in 1990, new owner Salem Communications relocated the station to New Jersey. The facilities were based in Teaneck, Rutherford, and Hasbrouck Heights at different times.Jim Hawkin's WMCA transmitter page In December 2013, WMCA returned to New York City. Salem moved WMCA and WNYM from Hasbrouck Heights into the former studios of WOR at 111 Broadway in lower Manhattan. As of July 18, 2019, WMCA's programming began airing on the FM dial in Northern New Jersey, using 250-watt translator station W272DX (102.3 MHz). While it is licensed to New York City, the translator's signal emanates from the towers of Multicultural Broadcasting-owned WPAT in Clifton, New Jersey, off the Garden State Parkway.Radio-Locator.com/W272DX  See also  * Radio broadcasting  References   External links   * Tribute site in remembrance of WMCA's Good Guys era * NYC AM Radio History - WMCA * WMCA News Department Profile & Interviews - 1978 * The 1960s week-by-week * Site visit to WMCA Kearny facility MCA MCA Category:Radio stations established in 1925 Category:1925 establishments in New York (state) Category:Salem Media Group properties Category:New York Giants (NL) broadcasters ","title":"WMCA (AM)"},{"id":"921544","text":"Three Women in Church (1881) Wilhelm Maria Hubertus Leibl (October 23, 1844 ‚Äì December 4, 1900) was a German realist painter of portraits and scenes of peasant life. Biography Leibl was born in Cologne, where his father was the director of the Cathedral choir. He was apprenticed to a locksmith before beginning his artistic training with the local painter Hermann Becker in 1861. He entered the Munich Academy in 1864, subsequently studying with several artists including Carl Theodor von Piloty. He set up a group studio in 1869, with Johann Sperl, Theodor Alt, and Rudolf Hirth du Fr√™nes. At about the same time, Gustave Courbet visited Munich to exhibit his work, making a considerable impression on many of the local artists by his demonstrations of alla prima painting directly from nature.Forster-Hahn 2001, p. 155 Leibl's paintings, which already reflected his admiration for the Dutch old masters, became looser in style, their subjects rendered with thickly brushed paint against dark backgrounds. Career In 1869, following Courbet's suggestion,Novotny 1978 p.288 Leibl went to Paris, where he was introduced to √âdouard Manet, but was forced to return to Germany in 1870, due to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War.Artist biography in German Masters of the Nineteenth Century, pp. 269‚Äì70 In 1873 Leibl left Munich for the isolated Bavarian countryside, where he depicted the local peasants in everyday scenes devoid of sentimentality or anecdote. The sketchlike quality of his earlier paintings was replaced by greater precision and attention to drawing. Living from 1878 to 1882 in Berbling, he painted perhaps his best-known work, the Three Women in Church (Kunsthalle, Hamburg). Its intensely realistic style recalls Hans Holbein in its clarity of definition. During the following years he moved to the town of Bad Aibling and, in 1892, to Kutterling, as his paintings united the disciplined drawing he had adopted in the 1880s with a new delicacy and luminosity. Leibl painted without preliminary drawing, setting to work directly with color, an approach that has parallels to Impressionism. His commitment to the representation of reality as the eye sees it earned him recognition in his lifetime as the preeminent artist of a group known as the Leibl-Kreis (Leibl Circle) that included, among others, Carl Schuch, Wilhelm Tr√ºbner, Otto Scholderer, and Hans Thoma. During the first half of the 1870s, Leibl executed a series of 19 etchingsNovotny 1978, p.289 in a meticulous style. His charcoal drawings are conceived in great masses of light and shadow, blocked in as though he were using a brush and paint. He visited the Netherlands in 1898, and his work was included in the Berlin Secession exhibition the following year. He died in W√ºrzburg in 1900.

German Pinscher and Miniature Pinscher, breeds of the Pinscher group. Before 1888. Origins It is considered that the German Pinscher is a prototypical Pinscher and one of the oldest German breeds, more closely related to the Standard Schnauzer (once known as the Wire-Haired Pinscher) than the Dobermann and other Pinschers. Since the mid-19th-century breeders stopped crossbreeding these coat types, and with the formation of the German Pinscher-Schnauzer-Club (PSK) in 1895, advanced them to distinct breed varieties. Etymology There are several theories on the etymology of the word Pinscher; that it derives from French \\"pincer\\", meaning \\"to seize\\" and \\"to nip\\", or \\"to bite\\" and \\"to grip\\" which are possibly related to their function of catching vermin on the farm, that it derives from English \\"pinch\\" referring to their clipped ears, \\"fox terrier\\" type of dog (considered that it was a descriptive term meaning \\"settler\\" or \\"terrier\\" dog method of working, and not heritage), or biter, although the verb \\"pinch\\" has the same early 13th century Old North French *pinchier derivation, which itself possibly originates from Vulgar Latin. Breeds The F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale recognizes the following pinscher breeds in Group 2, Section 1: Pinschers and Schnauzers, Section 1.1 Pinscher: *Austrian Pinscher (√ñsterreichischer Pinscher, no. 64) *Dobermann (no. 143) *German Pinscher (Deutscher Pinscher, no. 184) *Miniature Pinscher (Zwergpinscher, no. 185) *Affenpinscher (no. 186) Provisional: *Danish-Swedish Farmdog (Dansk-svensk g√•rdshund, no. 356)F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale Breeds Provisionally Accepted *In addition, the Harlequin Pinscher was earlier accepted by the FCI, but it was officially removed after its extinction. There may be other related hunting dogs called pinscher that are not recognized breeds. In addition, individual breeders often attempt the creation of new breeds which they may call pinschers. One example of these is the Carlin Pinscher, which has been developed by crossing the Pug with the Miniature Pinscher, or other similar breeds. There are a very large number of sporting clubs, breed clubs, and internet-based breed registries and businesses in which dogs may be registered under whatever name the owner or seller wishes.Dog Breed Registries in North America Gallery File:Oostenrijkse pinscher.jpgAustrian Pinscher File:European Dobermann.jpgDobermann File:Bvdb-duitse pincher.jpgGerman Pinschers File:Miniature pinscher.jpgMiniature Pinscher File:Affenpinscher.jpgAffenpinscher References * Top Pinscher is a Hall of Fame to Champions ( FCI, AKC, AUS ) Pinscher around of the world.

The rebirth of this genre was linked with the rise of Corsican nationalism in the 1970s. The anthem of Corsica is \\"Dio vi Salvi Regina\\". Barbara Furtuna performing at Warszawa Cross Culture Festival in September 2011. Every June, Calvi is home to an International Jazz Festival and in September there are the annual Rencontres de Chants Polyphoniques.  Folk music  =Dance= There are two dances of ancient origin found in Corsica: the caracolu, a women's funeral dance, and the moresca, illustrating the struggle between Moors and Christians. These days, they're not danced anymore. Traditional dances like the quatriglia (quadrille) or the scuttiscia (Scottish) have known some kind of revival over the last twenty years, groups like Diana di L'alba and Dopu Cena recorded the music and the associations Tutti in Piazza and Ochju √† Ochju animate dance nights and teach as well. The granitula, a spiral procession, is still performed by the confraternities on Good Friday. =Monophonic song= The oldest vocal forms include such monophonic forms as voceri (sing. voceru) laments for the dead usually improvised by women; bandits' laments; laments for animals; lullabies; songs of departure; tribbiere (sing. tribbiera) or threshing songs); songs of mule- drivers; chjam' √® rispondi (‚Äòcall and response‚Äô, a contest in improvised poetry); the currente (e.g. greeting guests; these have a distinctive fiddle accompaniment) and the cuntrastu (an exchange between a young man and woman). = Polyphonic song = Polyphonic songs (pulifunie) in Corsica are a cappella, and can be either spiritual or secular. Hymns, motets, and funereal songs (lamentu) are an example of the former, while the nanna (lullaby) and the paghjella are examples of the latter. Traditionally, 4 to 6-voice improvised polyphony was sung only by men, with the exception of the voceru (sung only by women) and cuntrastu (usually 2-voice) and nanne often sung by women. Brotherhoods of polyphonic singers (cunfraternita) remain, some dating back to the 12th century. Corsica's current tradition of improvised vocal polyphony is more recent, dating to 15th century. It is traced to renaissance practice of falsobordone and the Genoese tradition of Trallalero. The tradition of Corsican polyphonic singing had nearly become extinct until its revival (riaquistu) in the 1970s. It is now a central part of Corsican national identity, and is sometimes linked with political agitation for autonomy or independence. Some popular modern groups include I Chjami Aghjalesi, the Palatini, A Filetta, Terra, Voce di Corsica, Alte Voce, Barbara Furtuna, Vaghjime, Cinqui So', all-female Donnisulana, Les Nouvelles Polyphonies Corses, Tavagna, Canta u Populu Corsu and I Muvrini. The region of Balagne has emerged as a hot spot for Corsican music, producing groups like U Fiatu Muntese. = Relation to the World Music Market = One style of Corsican polyphonic singing that was particularly associated with Corsican nationalism and the 1970s resurgence of traditional Corsican music was paghjella, which had previously only survived in villages in the interior of the island. Paghjella traditionally consisted of three voices - known as bassu, secunda, and terza - phrasing polyphonic melodic lines, and typically involved staggered entrances by the three voices and heavy use of the Picardy Third.Bithell, C. (1996). Polyphonic Voices: National Identity, World Music and the Recording of Traditional Music in Corsica. British Journal of Ethnomusicology, 5, 39-66. In the late 1980s, due to the growth in popularity of so-called World Music - especially the success of the Bulgarian polyphonic choral recordings of the album Le Myst√®re des Voix Bulgares - Corsican artists such as Voce di Corsica began to record music for the international market. Attempts to appeal to this market had a major effect on Corsican music. Ethnomusicologist Caroline Bithell describes some of these changes, saying that paghjella recordings began to shift from a more polyphonic sound to a more \\"homophonic sound where the emphasis is on the effect created by the sum of the voices,\\" as opposed to earlier examples of paghjella, \\"where the individual voices and melodic lines are far more clearly differentiated and behave more independently.\\" Additionally, younger singers may have a tendency to exaggerate use of elements considered by outside music consumers to be \\"typically Corsican,\\" such as heavy use of melisma. Despite the changes initiated by interaction with the world music market, Bithell argues that Corsica can also be seen as \\"one of the success stories, in musical terms, of an era where there are tales aplenty of once unique and flourishing musical cultures threatening to disappear forever,\\" and that partly as a result of commercial recordings, \\"indigenous music has been pulled from the brink of the grave and grown to take its place as a national emblem.\\" Corsican traditional music, however, does not necessarily fit the typical definition of \\"world music\\", as it is generally recorded on the island of Corsica, difficult to find and listen to outside of Corsica, and not concerned with sounding \\"suited to the disco floor\\". Corsican traditional music also does not fit the typical definition of \\"folk music\\", as there is not a clear definition between \\"educated exponents of the tradition and the great majority of local people\\"- that is, the Corsican musical tradition has remained a part of everyday life. = Traditional instruments = The cetera, a cittern of 4 to 8 double strings that is of Tuscan origin and dates back to the Renaissance, is the most iconic Corsican traditional instrument. Its most prominent exponent is Roland Ferrandi (also a lutenist). * Caramusa - a bagpipe made of wood, leather and reed * Cialamedda (also cialamella/cialambella) - formerly a reed instrument, more recently with a wooden box body * Mandulina - a mandolin * Pirula - a reed recorder * Pifana (also pivana) - a type of gemshorn generally made from a goat horn * Riberbula - related to the jaw harp * Sunaglieri - mule bells * Timpanu - a triangle * Urganettu - a diatonic accordion External links *BBC Radio 3 Audio (105 minutes): Corsica and Sardinia.

First published in 1991, Wild Swans contains the biographies of her grandmother and her mother, then finally her own autobiography. The book won two awards: the 1992 NCR Book Award and the 1993 British Book of the Year. The book has been translated into 37 languages and sold over 13 million copies.  Synopsis  =Chang's Grandmother's story= Xue Zhiheng, Jung Chang's grandfather. The book starts by relating the biography of Chang's grandmother (Yu-fang). From the age of two, she had bound feet. As the family was relatively poor, her father schemed to have her taken as a concubine to high-ranking warlord General Xue Zhi-heng, in order to gain status, which was hugely important in terms of quality of life. After a wedding ceremony to the General, who already had a wife and many concubines, the young girl was left alone in a wealthy household with servants, and did not see her \\"husband\\" again for six years. Despite her luxurious surroundings, life was tense as she feared the servants and the wife of the General would report rumors or outright lies to him. She was allowed to visit her parents' home, but never allowed to spend the night. After his six year absence, the General made a brief conjugal visit to his concubine, during which a daughter, Chang's mother, was conceived. General did not stay there for long, even to see his daughter but he named his daughter Bao Qin meaning precious zither. During the child's infancy, Chang's grandmother put off persistent requests for her to be brought to the General's main household, until he became very sick and it was no longer a request. Chang's grandmother had no choice but to comply. During her visit to the household, the General was dying. The general had no male heir, and Chang's mother was very important to the family. Realizing that the General's wife would have complete control over her life and her child's, when he would die, Chang's grandmother fled with her baby to her parents' home, sending false word to her husband's family that the child had died. With his last words, the General unexpectedly proclaimed her free at age twenty-four. Eventually she married a much older doctor (Dr. Xia) with whom she and her daughter, Chang's mother, made a home in Jinzhou, Manchuria. She was no more a concubine, but a true, beloved wife. =Chang's Mother's story= The book now moves to the story of Chang's mother (Bao Qin/De-hong), who at the age of fifteen began working for the Communist Party of China and Mao Zedong's Red Army. As the Revolution progressed, her work for the party helped her rise through the ranks. She met the man who would become Chang's father (Wang Yu/Shou-yu), a high-ranking officer. The couple were soon married but Communist Party dictates meant they were not allowed to spend much time together. Eventually, the couple were transferred to Yibin, Chang's father's hometown. It was a long and arduous trek. Chang's mother traveled on foot because of her rank, while her father rode in a Jeep. He was not aware that Chang's mother was pregnant. After arrival at Nanjing, Chang's mother undertook gruelling military training. After the strain of the training coupled with the journey, she suffered a miscarriage. Chang's father swore to never again be inattentive to his wife's needs. In the following years Chang's mother gave birth to Jung and four other children. The focus of the book now shifts again to cover Jung's own autobiography. =Chang's story= The Cultural Revolution started when Chang was a teenager. Chang willingly joined the Red Guards though she recoiled from some of their brutal actions. As Mao's personality cult grew, life became more difficult and dangerous. Chang's father became a target for the Red Guards when he mildly but openly criticised Mao due to the suffering caused to the Chinese people by the Cultural Revolution. Chang's parents were labeled as capitalist roaders and made subjects of public struggle meetings and torture. Chang recalls that her father deteriorated physically and mentally, until his eventual death. Her father's treatment prompted Chang's previous doubts about Mao to come to the fore. Like thousands of other young people, Chang was sent down to the countryside for education and thought reform by the peasants, a difficult, harsh and pointless experience. At the end of the Cultural Revolution Chang returned home and worked hard to gain a place at university. Not long after she succeeded, Mao died. The whole nation was shocked in mourning, though Chang writes that: \\"People had been acting for so long they confused it with their true feelings. I wondered how many of the tears were genuine\\". Chang said that she felt exhilarated by Mao's death. At university Chang studied English. After her graduation and a stint as an assistant lecturer, she won a scholarship to study in England and left for her new home. She still lives in England today and visits mainland China on occasion to see her family and friends there, with permission from Chinese authorities. Reception Wild Swans was translated into 37 languages and sold 13 million copies, receiving praise from authors such as J. G. Ballard. Although it has also been translated into Chinese, it is banned in China. However, the book is available in Hong Kong and Taiwan.  Adaptations  The book was translated for the stage in early 2012, for the Young Vic.http://www.youngvic.org/archive/wild- swans The book was adapted by Alexandra Wood and directed by Sacha Wares. The Daily Telegraph gave it four out of five stars, and called it 'enormously refreshing' while The Guardian praised the production design. On November 26, 2006, Variety announced that Portobello Pictures had purchased the film rights to the book. Portobello Pictures' Eric Abraham acquired the rights with Christopher Hampton on board to write the screenplay.

The spacecraft was designed for both crewed and autonomous uncrewed cargo resupply flights, but was never used operationally in its intended role ‚Äì only four test missions were flown (including three that docked to Salyut space stations) during the program. The Functional Cargo Block (FGB) of the TKS spacecraft later formed the basis of several space station modules, including the Zarya FGB module on the International Space Station. The TKS spacecraft consisted of two spacecraft mated together, both of which could operate independently: * The VA spacecraft (known mistakenly in the West as the Merkur spacecraft), which would have housed the cosmonauts during launch and reentry of a TKS spacecraft, while traveling to and from an Almaz space station. * And the Functional Cargo Block (FGB) which, in order to resupply an Almaz space station, carried docking hardware, tanks, and a large pressurized cargo compartment. Furthermore, the FGB carried the on-orbit maneuvering engines for the TKS. While the VA carried the reentry hardware, and only minimal life support and maneuvering systems, the FGB would have been used as the primary orbital maneuvering system and cargo storage for the TKS spacecraft. The FGB could also be used alone as an uncrewed cargo module without a VA spacecraft, which enabled the FGB design to be re-purposed as FGB space station modules later on. The VA spacecraft, on the other hand, was also intended to be launched as \\"Almaz APOS\\", mated with an Almaz-OPS space station core as the primary orbital maneuvering system, instead of an FGB. In the 2010s, Excalibur Almaz planned to use old VA capsules as low-cost cargo return vehicles. However, the company ultimately sold much of their equipment and announced that the remainder was to become an educational exhibit.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/shooting-for-the-moon-time- called-on-isle-of-man-space-race-10101750.html  Design  A model of a TKS spacecraft. On the left is the cylindrical Functional Cargo Block with attached solar panels. In the middle is the VA spacecraft, with the conical VA return capsule for the crew and the VA's orbital maneuvering engines in the long nose section. Standing right front is the launch escape system, which would have been attached to the top of the VA's nose section during launch and jettisoned after a successful launch. The TKS spacecraft was designed by Vladimir Chelomei (the VA capsule) and V. N. Bugayskiy (the FGB block) as a crewed spacecraft launched with Proton rocket alternative to the Soyuz spacecraft for use with Almaz space stations. Development began in 1965; the Almaz programme had been abandoned by the time the first TKS spacecraft flew in 1977. The VA spacecraft (\\"Vozvrashaemiy Apparat\\") was flown separately on four test missions with two craft per launch to test the design, as well as one \\"all-up\\" test mission and three resupply missions. The project had further evolved with space station \\"Modulny\\" (\\"Modular\\") based on the TKS design outline, reworked to dock with Salyut 7, Mir and ISS space stations. This development was designated FGB, or Functional Cargo Block. The TKS spacecraft consisted of an 11F74 \\"Vozvraschaemyi Apparat\\" (or Return Vehicle commonly referred to as the VA), attached to an 11F77 \\"Transportniy Korabl Snabzheniya\\" (Functional/Cargo Block module or FGB). = TKS VA = The TKS VA spacecraft was itself a very compact and efficient spacecraft. Typically it would reenter the atmosphere within 2 orbits, but could fly autonomously for up to 31 hours. The pressurized crew re-entry capsule was equipped with its own environmental control system, and topped with reaction control system, de-orbit braking engine, parachute system, and soft landing engines. Although extensively flight tested, it never flew with a crew on board. The VA design was derived from the planned capsule for the Chelomei's LK-1 crewed circumlunar spacecraft of the 1960s. It was also the basis for Chelomei's LK-700 Lunar Lander crew capsule. The VA looked somewhat similar to the Apollo capsule, but was 30% smaller than its NASA counterpart. = TKS FGB = The FGB was entered from the VA spacecraft via a short tunnel. At the aft end a pilot station was equipped with controls and windows for manual docking with the Almaz space station. The docking port was also located here. Operational TKS spacecraft would have delivered KSI film return capsules to Almaz stations. These would have been stored around the docking port for transfer to the film capsule airlock for loading.

The VA capsule returned to Earth 16 August 1977. The remainder of the spacecraft ‚Äì the FGB ‚Äì deorbited on 2 February 1978. = TKS-2 (Kosmos 1267) = On 25 April 1981, TKS-2 was launched uncrewed as Kosmos 1267, the first FGB to dock with a space station. After separation and recovery of the VA capsule on 24 May 1981, the FGB docked on 19 June with Salyut 6, after 57 days of autonomous flight. It remained attached to the station until both deorbited and were destroyed on 29 July 1982. = TKS-3 (Kosmos 1443) = On 2 March 1983, TKS-3 was launched uncrewed as Kosmos 1443. This time, the VA remained attached and the first \\"complete\\" TKS docked to Salyut 7 two days after launch. TKS-3 separated from the station on 14 August. After undocking, the FGB and the VA spacecraft separated and the VA spacecraft continued in space for four more days demonstrating autonomous flight, before the VA capsule successfully re-entered on 23 August 1983, landing 100 km south-east of Aralsk and returning 350 kg of material from the station. The FGB deorbited itself on 19 September 1983. = TKS-4 (Kosmos 1686) = A drawing of the last flown TKS spacecraft, Kosmos 1686, depicted docked to the Salyut 7 space station. The VA capsule is visible on the bottom left. The \\"nose section\\" of the VA spacecraft, that would have contained the de-orbit engines for the VA capsule, has been replaced with remote sensing instruments. TKS-4 was launched uncrewed as Kosmos 1686 on 27 September 1985. The landing systems, ECS, seats, and crewed controls were removed from the VA spacecraft, and instead other payload was installed: a high-resolution photo apparatus, an infrared telescope and the Ozon spectrometer. The TKS successfully docked with Salyut 7. The \\"military\\" long-duration crew Salyut 7 EO-4, consisting of Viktor Savinykh, Alexander Volkov and the commander Vladimir Vasyutin, had crewed Salyut 7 that month to conduct experiments with TKS-4. Commander Vasyutin fell ill soon after arriving at the station. Originally scheduled to have a six- month stay aboard Salyut 7, Vasyutin's illness forced the crew to make an emergency return to Earth on 21 November 1985, preventing the crew from finishing the TKS experiments. The crew of Soyuz T-15 returned to Salyut 7 in May 1986, to conclude some of the experiments and ferry equipment to the then new Mir space station. Salyut 7 was moved to a higher orbit after that mission, while awaiting another \\"TKS\\" crew ‚Äì there were even plans to return using the Buran shuttle. Such flights never materialized before Salyut 7 and Kosmos 1686 deorbited on 7 February 1991, burning up together over Argentina.  Further usage  The TKS design, which has never been flown crewed, has gone on to provide the basic structure for several later space-station components, such as: * Kvant-1 tug * Kvant-2 Mir module * Kristall Mir module * Spektr Mir module * Priroda Mir module * Polyus (FGB) spacecraft * Zarya (FGB-1) ISS module * Russian Research Module (FGB-2) ISS module (canceled) * Nauka (FGB-2) ISS module Two TKS/Almaz VA capsules were bought for commercial use by the private spaceflight company Excalibur Almaz. As of 2014, one of those were auctioned for 1 million euro, and the other was reportedly shipped away from the company's headquarters on Isle of Man in an undisclosed direction.

The site and Lum's opinions became very popular, and the Lum site became one of the most respected sources of MMOG news on the Internet. Mythic Entertainment hired Mr. Jennings in 2001 to work on Dark Age of Camelot.\\" Carless, p. 112. Biography Jennings was born c. 1966, and began gaming at the age of 10, when he began playing Dungeons & Dragons.\\"About the Author\\", Massively Multiplayer Games for Dummies He created his first website to post tips and tricks about the 1996 game The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall. Around 1998/1999, his focus shifted to Ultima Online (UO), an early graphical MMO first released in 1997, and one of the first to become well known in popular culture. Jennings, whose primary career was as a database programmer, became a respected critic of UO, as he posted detailed critiques of the game. Jennings's strong views on \\"macroing\\" ‚Äì the practice of automating aspects of the game, effectively making it easier ‚Äì made him very popular with some UO players. As noted by game researcher Edward Castronova, this was an early example of a site where a game's designers had strong opposition from certain players, who would use their websites to actively critique a game's development.Castronova, p. 300 Jennings' writing was characterized by a mixture of humor and vitriolic anger, and his posts were known to readers as \\"rants\\". The site became frequented by both fans and haters of UO, along with some of UO's developers and personnel, as well as developers of competitor games. With the 1999 release of a competitor to UO, EverQuest, Jennings expanded his writing to the new game. His early analysis of EQ focused on its differences to UO. However, he went on to criticize EverQuest directly. Jennings argued that the game forced players to spend long periods of time to gain very little, and that this was not fun. He also argued that the game consisted of fighting the same monsters repeatedly. He offered several examples of player greed, in his view, damaging the experience of the game for other players. Other issues he covered included \\"squatting\\" by large guilds, class balance, real-money trading, server lag, \\"raiding\\" as an end-game, and the later expansions' lack of finished and working content. Jennings continued to write about a number of other MMORPGs as they were released, including Asheron's Call and Anarchy Online. His later works became even more elaborate, such as a mock-up event for Shadowbane created entirely with Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness sprites. Instead of the usual review article for World War II Online, he posted a long, profane and amusing chatlog of him testing the game offline, in which he proclaimed, \\"I WILL TAXI TO VICTORY!\\", a phrase which became a favorite among his fans. Jennings' website attracted many well- known MMORPG staff and developers who took part in discussions on the forums. These included Richard Garriott, Raph Koster, and Mark Jacobs. Discussions often centered around the very virtual worlds they built, with much input from the community, both constructive and negative. In 2001, when Jennings lost his job due to the dot-com crash, he was hired as a database programmer by Jacobs' company, Mythic Entertainment, makers of Dark Age of Camelot. He developed the Camelot Herald. Once he began working for Mythic, Jennings decided he could not continue writing for his Lum the Mad site. It subsequently had its name changed to slownewsday.net and was maintained by volunteers for a time, but eventually closed. Also in 2001, Jennings started a new blog, Broken Toys,http://www.brokentoys.org which he infrequently updates about random subjects sometimes but not always relating to online gaming. Work from previous blogs is hosted in a separate archive. In 2005, Jennings published the book Massively Multiplayer Games for Dummies. On February 17, 2006, Jennings left Mythic and began working at another MMO company, NCsoft in Austin, Texas. August 13, 2008 was Jennings' last day at NCsoft, having been let go as part of corporate refocusing. According to his blog, Jennings will begin working on a game called Webwars with John Galt Games. In 2010 Jennings returned to NCsoft, first as a contract developer and then as a full-time employee. His employment with NCsoft ended in September, 2012. He was employed at Portalarium until Jun 20, 2018. https://twitter.com/lum_/status/1009194147054530561 Personal life Around 1995, Jennings married. He and his wife Pat have a son, Robert. Origin of name Lum the Mad was the name of Jennings's Ultima Online characters. The original \\"Lum the Mad\\" was a character in the Greyhawk campaign setting for Dungeons & Dragons and was previously mentioned in the 2nd edition Advanced Dungeons and Dragons book \\"The Dungeon Master's Guide\\" in the artifact section referring to \\"The Machine of Lum the Mad\\". In the game Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, there is a machine built by one \\"Lum the Mad\\". This is an artifact originally described in the 1st Edition Advanced Dungeon and Dragons Dungeon Master's Guide. In the computer game this machine is found on the fourth level of the dungeon called \\"Watcher's Keep.\\" Lum the Mad is also referenced briefly at the finale of Planescape: Torment.

Development The aircraft was designed in response to a Polish Air Force requirement for a modern piston-engined trainer with a retractable tricycle landing gear to replace Junak 3 and Yak-11 aircraft. The main designer was Tadeusz So≈Çtyk ‚Äì hence the designation letters TS. The plane was named Bies ‚Äì a folk name for the devil. Work started in 1953 and the first prototype was flown on July 23, 1955. In 1956 and 1957 it beat three international records in its class.World records of height 7084.5 m in C-Ic class (weight 1000‚Äì1750 kg), distance in a closed circuit 2884.5 km in C-Id class (weight 1750‚Äì3000 kg), speed 317 km/h in a closed circuit 2000 km in C-Ic class The second prototype was shown at the Paris Air Show in 1957. In 1957 the first experimental series of 10 aircraft was produced by WSK-Okecie (designated as TS-8 BI). A slightly improved main variant, designated as theTS-8 BII, was produced from 1958 to 1960 by WSK Mielec. The last 10 machines,TS-8 BIII, were built with better avionics, in total 251 TS-8 were produced of which 229 were the TS-8 BII variant. The TS-8 had good handling and performance; a noisy engine being one of its few flaws. It was the first really modern aircraft designed in Poland after the war, that also used a Polish engine. Design The TS-8 was an all- metal low-wing cantilever monoplane, with metal-covered semi-monocoque fuselage, oval in cross-section. The three-part single-spar wing, of semi- monocoque design, creating a transverse inverted gull wing \\"W\\" shape. It had a Tricycle retractable landing gear, and a 7-cylinder WN-3 radial engine in front, delivering 330 hp take-off power and 283 hp normal power to a 2.2 m diameter two-blade variable pitch wooden propeller. The crew of two, sat in a tandem enclosed cockpit, with twin controls, the student in front with the instructor in the rear. Canopy sections above the crewmen slid rearwards. The plane had no armament, except for the experimental series TS-8 BI, which had one 12.7mm machine gun and two small bomb pylons. Operational history The TS-8s began to be withdrawn from Polish Air Force service in the mid-1960s, being replaced by PZL TS-11 Iskra jet trainers. Over 100 withdrawn aircraft were handed over to the civilian aviation (aero clubs). Most TS-8s were finally withdrawn from civilian aviation by 1978, with three currently remaining airworthy. Two TS-8s were used by Indonesia. Variants TS-8 Bies TS-8 BII at the Polish Aviation Museum ;TS-8 :3 prototypes. ;TS-8 BI :First experimental series, 10 built. ;TS-8 BII :Improved TS-8 BI.

Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the music of Tahiti was dominated by festivals called heiva. Dancing was a vital part of Tahitian life then, and dances were used to celebrate, pray and mark almost every occasion of life. Examples include the men's  ª≈çte ªa dance and the couple's 'upa ªupa. Professional dance troupes called  ªarioi were common, and they moved around the various islands and communities dancing highly sensually and erotically. In the early 19th century, however, colonial laws severely restricted these and other dances, which were considered immoral. Herman Melville celebrated one such dance (he called it the 'lori-lori') for its sensuality. They were replaced instead by genres of Christian music such as himene tarava. The word 'himene' is derived from the English word 'hymn' (Tahiti was first colonized by the English). Likewise, the harmonies and tune characteristics / 'strophe patterns' of much of the music of Polynesia is western in style and derived originally from missionary influence via hymns and other church music. One unique quality of Polynesian music is the use of the sustained 6th chord in vocal music, though typically the 6th chord is not used in religious music. Traditional instruments include a conch-shell called the pu and a nose flute called the vivo, as well as numerous kinds of drums made from hollowed-out tree trunks and dog or shark skin.

It shares water boundaries with Quebec to the north and New York State to the east and south, as well as a small land boundary with the Vaudreuil-Soulanges region of Quebec to the east. It includes the cities of Ottawa and Kingston, and the census divisions of the following: the counties of Prescott and Russell, Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, Lanark, Renfrew, Leeds and Grenville, Frontenac and Lennox and Addington. Some sources may also include Hastings, Prince Edward, and occasionally Northumberland in the definition of Eastern Ontario, but others classify them as Central Ontario. The region may also be referred to as Southeastern Ontario to differentiate it from the Northern Ontario secondary region of Northeastern Ontario. History French explorers and fur traders were the first recorded Europeans to pass through this region. Samuel de Champlain, explorer, traversed the Ottawa River in 1615 on his way westward to the Great Lakes. The largest city in the region is the city of Ottawa, capital of Canada, which accounts for roughly 60% of Eastern Ontario's population. Kingston, itself once capital of the Province of Canada, is another city in the region outside of the National Capital Region. Much of the remainder of the region relies on agriculture and tourism. Heavier reliance on recreation and tourism exists in the more rugged Renfrew county in the northwest of Eastern Ontario. Downtown Ottawa Of all Ontario's regions, parts of Eastern Ontario are the most heavily influenced by the United Empire Loyalists, American settlers who moved to Upper Canada out of loyalty to the British Crown during and after the American Revolutionary War. The Loyalist influence has a presence in the counties of Lennox and Addington, Leeds and Grenville, Frontenac, Lanark, Hastings, and Prince Edward. In Ottawa, Prescott and Russell, Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, and Renfrew, Eastern Ontario is home to the largest Franco-Ontarian community within Ontario. Extensive immigration by Scottish Highlanders from the Highland land clearances also took place around the time of the United Empire Loyalist migration. After the Loyalist period, more waves of Highland emigration came primarily from Inverness-shire, Scotland to seek a better quality of life. The majority of these Scottish immigrants settled in the specific Highland community Glengarry County. Large numbers of Irish Catholics, mainly from Cork and surrounding counties also settled in the area in the decades following the War of 1812, the majority of them in or near present-day Ottawa. Many arrived through government backed immigration schemes to settle unoccupied lands and fill labour shortages. Along with the Franco-Ontarians in particular, they made up the majority of canal builders on the large Rideau Canal project and were heavily employed in the area's extensive lumber industry. Through the last century, newer immigrant groups have added to the cultural diversity, mostly in Ottawa. There are still a large number of Francophones in Eastern Ontario, especially in Prescott and Russell United Counties. Climate The climate of Eastern Ontario is humid continental with large seasonal variation. Snow and ice are dominant during the winter season. Ottawa receives close to 250 cm (100 in) of snowfall over an average winter. Winters are long and celebrated in Eastern Ontario. The average temperature in January is ‚àí6 ¬∞C (21 ¬∞F). In recent years, there has been winters with snow free periods lasting into early January. However, in the winter months of 2008 and 2019, there were records levels of snow fall. Ice storms are also relatively common, especially on lower terrain if compared with other parts of the country. One such large storm caused vast power outages and affected the local economy, known as the 1998 Ice Storm. Winters are more severe and longer along the Ottawa River, particularly in higher terrain of Renfrew County than further south along the Upper St. Lawrence River shoreline. Summers are fairly hot and humid in the Ottawa and St. Lawrence valleys. The average July maximum temperature is 27 ¬∞C (80 ¬∞F). Temperatures occasionally exceed 35 ¬∞C (95 ¬∞F), and during periods of hot weather, high humidity is often an aggravating factor, pushing the temperature into the 40s ¬∞C (100s ¬∞F) with the humidex. Thunderstorms are on occasion severe, causing tree and property damage. Spring and fall (especially spring) are changeable seasons, prone to extremes in temperature and unpredictable swings in conditions. Average annual precipitation is around 950 mm (37 in.). Geography Thousand Islands The eastern section of Eastern Ontario, that is east and southeast of Ottawa, including the towns of Cornwall, Embrun and Hawkesbury is generally a flat plain, dotted with some extensive woodlots and boggy marshes, but is primarily farmland. Certain sections here are prone to low-lying flooding and spring ice jams, particularly on the banks of the South Nation River. The Laurentian Highlands, which form a small section of the extensive Canadian Shield, cuts through the western section from the Upper Ottawa River valley southeast toward to the St. Lawrence River around Gananoque. Here sedimentary rock can be found folding over the Shield. This is also the portion where the greatest concentration of inland lakes are found. In Renfrew County, this higher terrain is called the 'Madawaska Highlands' after a major river that bisects these hills. Some highland peaks are over 400 m higher than the Ottawa River. The picturesque area of the St. Lawrence River bordering New York State is known as the Thousand Islands region reflected by its numerous small islands. The bulk of the Laurentian Upland is located just to the north of the Ottawa River in adjacent Quebec and covers a vastly larger area within that province. Along the extreme western edge of Eastern Ontario is a continuation of the Laurentian Highlands, known as the Opeongo Hills, and they contain some of the highest elevations in Southern Ontario. They stretch into the northern portions of Central Ontario, near Algonquin Provincial Park. Ottawa is at the confluence of the Rideau River and Ottawa River. A series of rugged rapids and waterfalls are found along these rivers in Ottawa. Most of the underlying rock in and around the city of Ottawa is limestone bedrock, also found in abundance farther south around Kingston. Limestone was used during the construction of the Rideau Canal, which connects Kingston and Ottawa by water and was also heavily used as the building blocks for many governmental and other buildings in both cities. The Ottawa and St. Lawrence Rivers do not actually converge in Ontario. A small portion of Quebec, Vaudreuil-Soulanges, lies between the Ontario-Quebec border and the river junction. The region has a land border with Ontario, but it is necessary to cross water to reach any other part of Quebec. =Geology= The Eastern Ontario region has a history of earthquakes. Several faults run through the region, and the area is near both the Western Quebec Seismic Zone and the Saint Lawrence rift system. Minor earthquakes occur in the region regularly, most of them too weak to be felt by people. More severe earthquakes, around 5‚Äì6 on the Richter magnitude scale, occur every sixty years, on average. The most recent of the earthquakes occurred in 2010. This earthquake, known as the 2010 Central Canada earthquake although it caused some power outages and minor damage to older buildings, did not cause significant damage because buildings in the area are required to be earthquake resistant by government regulations. The earthquake caused significant panic amongst the population, though: office buildings were evacuated in Ottawa, transit routes shut down, and in the minutes after the quake, cell phone service was down, as it was overloaded with calls made by panicked people attempting to talk to friends and relatives. Although the reaction was ridiculed by many, if buildings in the area were not designed to be earthquake-resistant, it would have caused significant damage. A similar earthquake in 1944 caused significant damage to buildings in Cornwall, as it was before earthquake-resistant architecture became common. Education Queens Theological Hall The region is home to several universities and colleges, including Carleton University, Queen's University, Royal Military College of Canada, the University of Ottawa, Saint Paul University, Algonquin College, La Cit√© coll√©giale, and St. Lawrence College. Algonquin College has campuses in Ottawa, Perth, Pembroke, Hawkesbury, and Renfrew, while St. Lawrence College has campuses in Kingston, Cornwall, and Brockville.

The Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist) (CPC-ML) participated in Manitoba's 1973 provincial election, running candidates in three ridings. Glen Brown received 33 votes for the party in the riding of Burrows, Aili Waldman received 12 votes in Inkster and Diane Waldman received 24 votes in St. Johns. All of these ridings were in north-end Winnipeg, and all were also contested by the Communist Party of Canada- Manitoba (CPC-M), a branch of the Communist Party of Canada and a non- Stalinist rival to the CPC-ML. The party also participated in a 1979 by- election in the north Winnipeg riding of Rossmere, following the resignation of Edward Schreyer. The party encouraged voters to boycott Manitoba's 1981 election, claiming that none of the other parties (including the CPC-M) were worth supporting. It did not run any of its own candidates, and does not appear to have participated in any subsequent Manitoba elections. During the 1990s the CPC-ML appears to have left the federal party. For several years CPC-ML(M) continued to operate a \\"Manitoba Regional Committee\\", publishing a weekly newsletter entitled Modern Communism.

It was written by George Harrison, the band's lead guitarist. The song serves as a comment on the disharmony within the Beatles following their return from studying Transcendental Meditation in India in early 1968. This lack of camaraderie was reflected in the band's initial apathy towards the composition, which Harrison countered by inviting his friend and occasional collaborator, Eric Clapton, to contribute to the recording. Clapton overdubbed a lead guitar part, although he was not formally credited for his contribution. Harrison wrote \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" as an exercise in randomness inspired by the Chinese I Ching. The song conveys his dismay at the world's unrealised potential for universal love, which he refers to as \\"the love there that's sleeping\\". Harrison first recorded it with a sparse backing of acoustic guitar and harmonium ‚Äì a version that appeared on the 1996 Anthology 3 outtakes compilation and, with the addition of a string arrangement by George Martin, on the Love soundtrack album in 2006. The full group recording was made in September 1968, at which point the song's folk- based musical arrangement was replaced by a production in the heavy rock style. The recording was one of several collaborations between Harrison and Clapton during the late 1960s and was followed by the pair co-writing the song \\"Badge\\" for Clapton's group Cream. On release, the song received praise from several music critics, and it has since been recognised as an example of Harrison's maturing as a songwriter beside his Beatles bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Rolling Stone ranked \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" 136th on its list of \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\", seventh on the \\"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\\", and at number 10 on its list of \\"The Beatles 100 Greatest Songs\\". Clapton's performance was ranked 42nd in Guitar Worlds 2008 list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\\". Harrison and Clapton often performed the song together live, during which they shared the lead guitar role over the closing section. Live versions featuring the pair were included on the Concert for Bangladesh album in 1971 and Live in Japan in 1992. Backed by a band that included McCartney and Ringo Starr, Clapton performed the song at the Concert for George in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death. Background and inspiration George Harrison wrote \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" after his return from India, where the Beatles had been studying Transcendental Meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi during the spring of 1968. The visit had allowed Harrison to re-engage with the guitar as his primary instrument, after focusing on the Indian sitar for the previous two years, and also marked the start of a prolific period for him as a songwriter. Inspiration for the song came to him when he was visiting his parents in Warrington, Cheshire, and he began reading the I Ching, or \\"The Book of Changes\\". As Harrison put it, \\"[the book] seemed to me to be based on the Eastern concept that everything is relative to everything else, as opposed to the Western view that things are merely coincidental.\\" Embracing this idea of relativism, he committed to writing a song based on the first words he saw upon opening a book, which happened to be \\"gently weeps\\". Harrison continued to work on the lyrics after this initial writing session. The song reflects the disharmonious atmosphere within the Beatles following their return from India. Harrison had led the band in their highly publicised endorsement of Transcendental Meditation and viewed this spiritual pursuit as superior in importance to their career momentum. When discussing another song he wrote at this time, \\"Not Guilty\\", Harrison said it referred to \\"the grief I was catching\\" from John Lennon and Paul McCartney for leading them to Rishikesh and supposedly hindering the group's career and the launch of their Apple record label. Eric Clapton, with whom Harrison collaborated on several recordings throughout 1968 as a distraction from the Beatles, said that \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" conveyed Harrison's spiritual isolation within the group. Author Jonathan Gould writes that, although in the past each of the Beatles had become temporarily subsumed in fads and personal interests, the level of Harrison's commitment to Indian spirituality as an alternative to the band was unprecedented. A demo that Harrison recorded at his home in Esher includes an unused verse: \\"I look at the trouble and hate that is raging / While my guitar gently weeps / As I'm sitting here, doing nothing but ageing ‚Ä¶\\" This version also includes the line \\"The problems you sow are the troubles you're reaping\\", which he similarly discarded. An early acoustic guitar and harmonium performance of the song features a slightly different third verse: \\"I look from the wings at the play you are staging / While my guitar gently weeps / As I'm sitting here, doing nothing but ageing ‚Ä¶\\" This version was released on the 1996 compilation Anthology 3 and was used as the basis of the 2006 Love remix, with a string arrangement by George Martin. Composition =Music= \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" was one of the few Beatles compositions from early 1968 that changed markedly from demo form to the official recording. Harrison's demos suggest the influence of folk music, yet the Beatles' version is in the heavy rock style typical of much of the band's late 1960s work. While noting the importance of Harrison's return to the guitar during this period, Gould describes the song as \\"virtually a declaration of his recommitment to rock\\". The song as originally issued by the Beatles is in the key of A minor, changing to A major over the bridges. Aside from the intro, the composition is structured into two rounds of verse and bridge, with an instrumental passage extending the second of these verse sections, followed by a final verse and a long instrumental passage that fades out on the released recording. All the sections consist of an even sixteen bars or measures, which are divided into four phrases. The chord progression over the verses includes a descending bass of A‚ÄìG‚ÄìF‚ÄìF (8‚Äì7‚Äì6‚Äì6) over an A-minor chord, leading to F-major on the F bass note. According to musicologist Dominic Pedler, the 8‚Äì7‚Äì6‚Äì6 progression represents a hybrid of the Aeolian and Dorian modes. The change to the parallel major key is heralded by a C chord as the verse's penultimate chord (replacing the D used in the second phrase of each verse) before the E that leads into the bridge. Musicologist Alan Pollack views this combination of C and E as representing a sense of \\"arrival\\", after which the bridge contains \\"upward [harmonic] gestures\\" that contrast with the bass descents that dominate the verse. Such contrasts are limited by the inclusion of minor triads (III, VI and II) played over the E chord that ends the bridge's second and fourth phrases. =Lyrics= In his lyrics to \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", Harrison revisits the theme of universal love and the philosophical concerns that were evident in his overtly Indian-influenced compositions, particularly \\"Within You Without You\\". The song is a lament for how a universal love for humankind is latent in all individuals yet remains unrealised. In the description of theologian Dale Allison, the song \\"conveys spiritual angst and an urgent religious point of view without being explicitly theological\\". Harrison sings of surveying \\"you all\\" and seeing \\"the love there that's sleeping\\". Musicologist Walter Everett comments that the change from the minor-mode verse to the parallel major might express hope that \\"unrealized potential\\" described in the lyrics is to be \\"fulfilled\\", but the continued minor triads \\"seem to express a strong dismay that love is not to be unfolded\\". During the bridges, Harrison adopts a repetitive rhyming scheme in the style of Bob Dylan to convey how humankind has become distracted from its ability to manifest this love. He sings of people that have been \\"inverted\\" and \\"perverted\\" from their natural perspective. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" follows in a lyrical tradition established by Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Bo Diddley, whereby emotions and actions are attributed to a musical instrument. According to an NME reviewer, writing in 1998, the song conveys \\"serious concern\\" for the Beatles' \\"dwindling esprit de corps\\". Harrison biographer Joshua Greene says that its message reflects the pessimism encouraged by world events throughout 1968, such as the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy in the United States, and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Allison writes that the lyrics represent the \\"antithesis of spiritual triumphalism\\", in which Harrison \\"mourns because love has not conquered all\\". Recording =Early attempts and basic track= The Beatles recorded \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" several times during the sessions for their self-titled double album, also known as \\"the White Album\\". The recording sessions, which began in late May 1968, were characterised by a lack of cooperation among the four band members, and by what Lennon's bandmates regarded as the overly intrusive presence of his new romantic partner, Yoko Ono. In this atmosphere, Harrison had initially been reluctant to present his new compositions to the group. Take 1 on 25 July ‚Äì the version later issued on Anthology 3 ‚Äì was a solo performance by Harrison, playing his Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar, with an overdubbed harmonium part. Sessions on 16 August and 5 September produced full band recordings of the song. In the case of the 16 August version, an overdubbing session on 3 September marked the first time that the Beatles had used eight-track recording at EMI Studios. At the same session, Harrison overdubbed a backwards (or \\"backmasked\\") guitar solo, as he had done two years before on \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", on the Revolver album, but he was not satisfied with the results. The Beatles then remade the basic track on 5 September ‚Äì a session that marked Ringo Starr's return to the group after he had walked out on 22 August, upset at the unpleasant atmosphere. While Harrison led the band in welcoming back their drummer, by installing a large flower display all over Starr's drum kit, he continued to think that his bandmates were not giving their best to the song. =Overdubs= Clapton had given Harrison his red Gibson Les Paul shortly before the session and subsequently used it on the song. On 6 September, during a ride from Surrey into London, Harrison asked Clapton to play guitar on the track. Clapton, who recognised Harrison's talent as a songwriter, and considered that his abilities had long been held back by Lennon and McCartney, was nevertheless reluctant to participate; he later recalled that his initial response was: \\"I can't do that. Nobody ever plays on Beatles records.\\" Harrison convinced him, and Clapton's lead guitar part, played on Harrison's Gibson Les Paul electric guitar \\"Lucy\\" (a recent gift from Clapton), was overdubbed that evening. Recalling the session in his 2007 autobiography, Clapton says that, while Lennon and McCartney were \\"fairly non- committal\\", he thought the track \\"sounded fantastic\\", adding: \\"I knew George was happy, because he listened to it over and over in the control room.\\" Harrison recalled that Clapton's presence also ensured that his bandmates \\"tr[ied] a bit harder\\" and \\"were all on their best behaviour\\". The Beatles carried out the remaining overdubs, which included an ascending piano motif, played by McCartney, over the introduction, Hammond organ by Harrison, and further percussion by Starr. McCartney also added a second bass part, played on his Fender Jazz Bass rather than on either of his usual H√∂fner or Rickenbacker models. =Mixing= Still wary that his contribution might present too much of a departure from the band's sound, Clapton requested that Harrison give the lead guitar track a more \\"Beatley\\" sound when mixing the song. During final mixing for the White Album, on 14 October, the guitar part was run through an ADT circuit with \\"varispeed\\", with engineer Chris Thomas manipulating the oscillator to achieve the desired \\"wobbly\\" effect. According to Everett, Lennon's tremolo-rich guitar part, recorded on 5 September, was retained only in the song's coda. Everett credits Clapton's guitar contribution with making the Beatles recording a \\"monumental\\" track. As particularly notable features, he highlights the increasing lengths of thrice- heard first scale degrees (0:17‚Äì0:19), the restraint shown by rests in many bars then unexpected appearances (as at 0:28‚Äì0:29), commanding turnaround phrases (0:31‚Äì0:33), expressive string bends marking modal changes from C to C (0:47‚Äì0:53), power retransition (1:21‚Äì1:24), emotive vibrato (2:01‚Äì2:07), and a solo (1:55‚Äì2:31) with a \\"measured rise in intensity, rhythmic activity, tonal drive and registral climb\\". In October 1968, Harrison reciprocated by co-writing \\"Badge\\" with Clapton and playing on Cream's recording of the track. Released on Cream's final album, Goodbye, \\"Badge\\" reflected Harrison's pop sensibilities and helped Clapton transition from the heavy blues style and its reliance on extended soloing, and onto the more song-based approach that he and Harrison admired in the Band's 1968 album Music from Big Pink. Release and reception Apple Records released The Beatles on 22 November 1968. One of four Harrison compositions on the double album, \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" was sequenced as the penultimate track on side one in the LP format, between Lennon's \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\" and \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\". The song was issued as the B-side of \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\", a McCartney- written song that had also tested the Beatles' patience during the White Album sessions. This single was an international hit, topping charts in Australia, Austria, Switzerland and West Germany, but was not released in Britain or the United States. LP cover of The Beatles. Some music critics have recognised \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" as a highlight of the Beatles' 1968 double album. Recalling the release in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner said that, in returning to pop/rock songwriting after his excursions into the Indian classical style, Harrison's four White Album songs \\"firmly established him as a contender\\" beside Lennon and McCartney. In Schaffner's description, \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" was the most instantly popular of \\"a quartet of more conventionally accessible pop songs [written by Harrison] that many felt were among the finest on the album\\". According to Beatles historian Erin Torkelson Weber, the release of the White Album marked the start of a period when many observers began to consider his songs \\"equal to some of Lennon and McCartney's best compositions\\", a view that was heightened with his two contributions to the Beatles' 1969 album Abbey Road, \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\". New Yorker columnist Mark Hertsgaard, writing in his 1995 book A Day in the Life, said \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" was \\"the first great composition of George's career and perhaps the single most impressive song on the White Album\\". Among contemporary reviews, Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone said that \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" was \\"one of George Harrison's very best songs\\", and likened it to \\"Blue Jay Way\\" in that it \\"recalls California, the simple Baja California beat, the dreamy words of the Los Angeles haze, the organic pace lapping around every room as if in invisible waves\\". Wenner found the lyrics \\"slightly self-righteous and preaching\\", representing \\"a general set of incidents, a message, like a sermon, impersonally directed to everyone\\", and concluded: \\"I am willing to bet something substantial that the lead guitarist on this cut is Eric Clapton, yet another involution of the circular logic on which this song [is] so superbly constructed as a musical piece.\\" In his review for the International Times, Barry Miles said the song was a \\"great tune\\" with \\"nice hi-hats\\" but a \\"lifeless\\" guitar part. Alan Smith of the NME credited the \\"warm voice\\" and \\"very strong melody\\" to McCartney and said that the track was one of the \\"highlights ... moving into a slightly Hendrix thing\\" and was bound to be \\"Another hit for somebody\\". Three weeks later, Smith acknowledged that the singer and composer was in fact Harrison, and added: \\"the words are evocative and the melody line is creeping into my mind to stay.\\" Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Geoffrey Cannon wrote in The Guardian: \\"George Harrison has seen the truth, and is anxious that we should see our truth. He's a preacher, man of fire. When his songs speak of 'you', the address is direct. He achieves his character in 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps', which, with Phil Ochs's 'Tape from California', is the first track I know that succeeds in making magnanimous love serious and touching.\\" Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Retrospective assessment and legacy \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" became a staple of US rock radio during the early 1970s, on a par with songs such as \\"Layla\\" by Clapton's short-lived band Derek and the Dominos, Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and the Who's \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\". In 1973, it appeared on the Beatles' double album compilation 1967‚Äì1970, as one of only three tracks representing the White Album. Capitol Records included it on The Best of George Harrison in 1976; a year before this, Harrison released a sequel to the song, titled \\"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\\", which also served as the final single issued by Apple in its original incarnation. The Beatles' recording appeared on the soundtrack to Withnail and I, a 1987 comedy film set in late-1960s London and produced by Harrison's company HandMade Films. Writing for The Observer in 2004, Pete Paphides described \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" as \\"George Harrison's startling coming of age as a songwriter\\" and one of the few tracks that \\"pick themselves\\" when listeners attempt to edit the double album down to a single disc. In his book Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald was less impressed with the track, saying that it \\"exudes a browbeating self-importance which quickly becomes tiresome\\". McCartney identified it as one of his favourite selections on the 1995‚Äì96 Anthology outtakes series, and he grouped the song with \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" as candidates for Harrison's \\"greatest track\\". Starr paired it with \\"Something\\" as \\"Two of the finest love songs ever written\\", adding: \\"they're really on a par with what John and Paul or anyone else of that time wrote.\\" In their written tributes to Harrison following his death in November 2001, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards each expressed their admiration for the song. Jagger said: \\"It's lovely, plaintive. Only a guitar player could write that ...\\" Rolling Stone ranked \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" 136th on its list of \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\", seventh on the \\"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\\", and at number 10 on its list of \\"The Beatles 100 Greatest Songs\\". Clapton's performance was ranked 42nd in Guitar Worlds 2008 list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\\". Among other critics' lists of the best Beatles songs, Paste magazine and Ultimate Classic Rock each ranked it at number 4, while Mojo placed it at number 17. In his commentary for the Mojo selection, English songwriter Chris Difford said that he had only come to fully appreciate the lyrics following Harrison's death in 2001; describing them as a \\"riposte\\" to Harrison's bandmates, particularly Lennon and McCartney, Difford added: \\"George was the one who came back from India with the spiritual awakening and carried it through to the rest of his life, whereas the others came back with the postcards.\\" In 2018, the music staff of Time Out London ranked \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" 20th on their list of the best Beatles songs. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the White Album's release, Jacob Stolworthy of The Independent listed it at number 1 on his ranking of the album's 30 tracks. He said the song was \\"hands down one of The Beatles' greatest\\" and, having being conceived through \\"disharmony ‚Äì in the world, as well as in the band he'd grown up with\\", \\"testament to Harrison's genius\\". Harrison live performances Harrison and Clapton performing \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" at the 1987 Prince's Trust Concert in London Harrison played \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" at every one of his rare concerts as a solo artist. Writing for Mojo in 2003, Ashley Kahn attributed the track's \\"classic\\" status to its evocation of \\"a band falling out of harmony\\" and, with regard to the enduring musical bond between Harrison and Clapton, its standing as \\"their song\\". At Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh, held at Madison Square Garden in New York on 1 August 1971, Clapton performed the song on a Gibson Byrdland, a hollow- body guitar more suited to jazz or country music than rock. He later said that this was a poor decision and, as with his substandard playing at the event, one that was indicative of his descent into heroin addiction.The Concert for Bangladesh Revisited with George Harrison and Friends, DVD, 2005. In his entry for The Concert for Bangladesh in the book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, Tom Moon nevertheless describes Clapton and Harrison's interplay as \\"one of the more thrilling two-man guitar explorations in rock\\", adding: \\"As they finish each other's thoughts, the two extend and amplify the song's intent: You haven't heard the full gamut of gentle (and not so) guitar weeping until you've heard this.\\" Quoted in \\"The Super Seventies \\"Classic 500\\": The Concert For Bangla Desh ‚Äì George Harrison and Friends\\". superseventies.com. Retrieved 19 March 2019. The version performed by Harrison during his brief set at the 1987 Prince's Trust Concert reunited him with Starr and Clapton, and features an extended coda with the guitars of Harrison and Clapton interweaving. On their 1991 tour of Japan, Harrison and Clapton performed \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" with additional background vocals. An edit combining parts of the 14 December and 17 December Tokyo Dome performances of the song was included on Harrison's 1992 double album Live in Japan. Harrison also featured the song in the set list for his only other tour as a solo artist, a series of North American concerts over November‚ÄìDecember 1974 with Ravi Shankar. Harrison shared the lead guitarist's role with Robben Ford, often extending the piece to eight minutes. While it was a popular inclusion in a set list that barely acknowledged Harrison's past as a former Beatle, his alteration of some of the lyrics ‚Äì so that his guitar \\"gently smiles\\" and \\"tries to smile\\" ‚Äì disappointed many concert-goers and reviewers. Author Simon Leng comments that on Harrison's return to Madison Square Garden towards the end of the tour, his playing on the song nevertheless received a standing ovation. Cover versions Canadian guitarist Jeff Healey covered \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" on his 1990 album Hell to Pay. Harrison participated in the recording, contributing on acoustic guitar and backing vocals. Also issued as a single, Healey's version peaked at number 27 in Canada, number 85 in the UK and number 25 in New Zealand. During the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II concert at Buckingham Palace Garden on 3 June 2002, McCartney performed the song with Clapton, as a tribute to Harrison. The performance appears on the DVD release Party at the Palace. On 29 November the same year, Clapton, backed by a large band that included McCartney, Starr, Dhani Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Marc Mann, performed \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" at the Concert for George in memory of Harrison. Author Ian Inglis writes that while Clapton was already \\"permanently associated\\" with \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" due to his presence on the White Album recording and the Concert for Bangladesh and Live in Japan versions, his long, closing solo at the Concert for George contained \\"perhaps the most expressive\\" playing of all those versions. American musician Todd Rundgren covered \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" for the 2003 album Songs from the Material World: A Tribute to George Harrison. Rundgren said of his contribution to the multi-artist tribute: \\"[Before the Beatles], I'd never heard the term 'lead guitarist.' George created the job description for my first paying gig, the vocation that I'm still lucky enough to practice today ‚Ä¶\\" Johnny Loftus of AllMusic views the recording as one of the collection's highlights, saying that Rundgren \\"effortlessly replicates the grandeur\\" of the Beatles' track. As his personal tribute to Harrison, Peter Frampton released a version of the song on his 2003 album Now. In 2004, when Harrison was inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist, \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" was played in tribute by a large band that included Tom Petty, Lynne, Steve Winwood, Mann, Dhani Harrison and Steve Ferrone. The performance concluded with a highly acclaimed extended guitar solo by Prince, who was also being inducted into the Hall of Fame. Among other cover versions, the song has also been recorded by guitarists such as Marc Ribot, Phish and Charlie Byrd, and on ukulele by Jake Shimabukuro. Toto did a cover version for their album Through the Looking Glass and in a live performance in Live in Amsterdam. Santana did a cover for his twentieth album Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time, in 2010, featuring singer India Arie and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Released as a single, it charted on Billboards Adult Contemporary. In 2016, Regina Spektor performed the song for the soundtrack to the film Kubo and the Two Strings, accompanied by Kevin Kmetz on a shamisen. 2016 music video In June 2016, Apple Corps and Cirque du Soleil released a music video for \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\". The video was created for the tenth anniversary re-staging of Cirque du Soleil's Love theatrical production. The video was directed by Dandypunk, Andr√© Kasten and Leah Moyer. Ryan Reed, describing the clip for rollingstone.com, wrote that \\"Dandypunk's hand-drawn illustrations depict Harrison's lyrics falling off the page into the air, transporting LOVE performer Eira Glover into a series of fantastical locations.

The rules are associated with Moscow because the city developed a reputation as being a particularly harsh locale for clandestine operatives who were exposed. The list may never have existed as written.  The rules  Agent Tony Mendez wrote: > Although no one had written them down, they were the precepts we all > understood for conducting operations in the most difficult of operating > environments: the Soviet capital. By the time they got to Moscow, everyone > knew these rules. They were dead simple and full of common sense. In the International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C., the Moscow Rules are given as: # Assume nothing. # Never go against your gut. # Everyone is potentially under opposition control. # Do not look back; you are never completely alone. # Go with the flow, blend in. # Vary your pattern and stay within your cover. # Lull them into a sense of complacency. # Do not harass the opposition. # Pick the time and place for action. # Keep your options open.  Fictional references  Other rules which have been circulated around the Internet and used in fiction include: * Murphy is right. (i.e., \\"What can go wrong, will go wrong, and at the worst possible moment.\\") * Any operation can be aborted. If it feels wrong, it is wrong. * Maintain a natural pace. * Build in opportunity, but use it sparingly. * Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. (Borrowed from Muhammad Ali.) * There is no limit to a human being's ability to rationalize the truth. * Technology will always let you down. * Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time it‚Äôs enemy action. (By Auric Goldfinger, taken from Ian Fleming's novel Goldfinger, Ch. 14 : Things That Go Thump In The Night) * Do not attract attention, even by being overly careful. Moscow rules are prominently referred to in John le Carr√©'s cold war books including Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smiley's People, as tradecraft, including use of inconspicuous signal markers (drawing pins, chalk marks), the use of dead drops, and the ways to signal the need for a (rare) face-to-face meeting. Moscow Rules are important at the beginning of Smiley's People, where the General invokes the rules to request a meeting with Smiley, but he is followed and killed by KGB assassins before it can happen. The applicable rule states that no documents may be carried that cannot be instantly discarded, in this instance a 35mm negative concealed in an empty pack of cigarettes. In Spooks there are references to the Moscow Rules. In particular, in Season 6 Episode 10, Harry Pearce tells someone, \\"Treat London as enemy territory, keep your head down, find an opportunity, and make a move.\\" In an earlier episode in Season 5, rogue MI6 agent Richard Dempsey is said to be in disguise and following the Moscow Rules, where the idea of treating the place as enemy territory is repeated. Mick Herron's Slough House series refers to the Moscow Rules and counters those with The London Rules. Daniel Silva's Moscow Rules places Gabriel Allon in Moscow. In The Middleman, episode 8 (the \\"Ectoplasmic Pan-Hellenic Investigation\\"), the Moscow Rules are recited. The rules are also referred to briefly by character Leila in the ‚ÄúToo Much Information‚Äù chapter of Jonathan Franzen‚Äôs novel Purity.  References   Further reading  * Whidden. Glenn H.

It counts 115 lines of alliterative verse. As is often the case in Anglo-Saxon verse, the composer and compiler are anonymous, and within the manuscript the poem is untitled. Origins The date of the poem is impossible to determine, but it must have been composed and written before the Exeter Book. The poem has only been found in the Exeter Book, which was a manuscript made at around 975, although the poem is considered to have been written earlier.\\"The Wanderer.\\" The Norton Anthology of English Literature. Ed. Julie Reidhead. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., 2012. 117-118. Print. The inclusion of a number of Norse-influenced words, such as the compound hrimceald (ice-cold, from the Old Norse word hrimkaldr), and some unusual spelling forms, has encouraged others to date the poem to the late 9th or early 10th century. The metre of the poem is of four-stress lines, divided between the second and third stresses by a caesura. Each caesura is indicated in the manuscript by a subtle increase in character spacing and with full stops, but modern print editions render them in a more obvious fashion. Like most Old English poetry, it is written in alliterative metre. It is considered an example of an Anglo-Saxon elegy. Contents The Wanderer conveys the meditations of a solitary exile on his past happiness as a member of his lord's band of retainers, his present hardships and the values of forbearance and faith in the heavenly Lord. The warrior is identified as eardstapa (line 6a), usually translated as \\"wanderer\\" (from eard meaning 'earth' or 'land', and steppan, meaning 'to step'), who roams the cold seas and walks \\"paths of exile\\" (wr√¶clastas). He remembers the days when, as a young man, he served his lord, feasted together with comrades, and received precious gifts from the lord. Yet fate (wyrd) turned against him when he lost his lord, kinsmen and comrades in battle‚Äîthey were defending their homeland against an attack‚Äîand he was driven into exile. Some readings of the poem see the wanderer as progressing through three phases; first as the anhoga (solitary man) who dwells on the deaths of other warriors and the funeral of his lord, then as the modcearig man (man troubled in mind) who meditates on past hardships and on the fact that mass killings have been innumerable in history, and finally as the snottor on mode (man wise in mind) who has come to understand that life is full of hardships, impermanence, and suffering, and that stability only resides with God. Other readings accept the general statement that the exile does come to understand human history, his own included, in philosophical terms, but would point out that the poem has elements in common with \\"The Battle of Maldon\\", a poem about a battle in which an Anglo-Saxon troop was defeated by Viking invaders. However, the speaker reflects upon life while spending years in exile, and to some extent has gone beyond his personal sorrow. In this respect, the poem is a \\"wisdom poem\\". The degeneration of ‚Äúearthly glory‚Äù is presented as inevitable in the poem, contrasting with the theme of salvation through faith in God. The wanderer vividly describes his loneliness and yearning for the bright days past, and concludes with an admonition to put faith in God, \\"in whom all stability dwells\\". It has been argued by some scholars that this admonition is a later addition, as it lies at the end of a poem that some would say is otherwise entirely secular in its concerns. Opponents of this interpretation such as I. L. Gordon have argued that because many of the words in the poem have both secular and spiritual or religious meanings, the foundation of this argument is not on firm ground. The psychological or spiritual progress of the wanderer has been described as an \\"act of courage of one sitting alone in meditation\\", who through embracing the values of Christianity seeks \\"a meaning beyond the temporary and transitory meaning of earthly values\\". Interpretation =Critical history= The development of critical approaches to The Wanderer corresponds closely to changing historical trends in European and Anglo- American philology, literary theory, and historiography as a whole. Like other works in Old English, the rapid changes in the English language after the Norman Conquest meant that it simply would not have been understood between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. Until the early nineteenth century, the existence of the poem was largely unknown outside of Exeter Cathedral library. In John Josias Conybeare's 1826 compilation of Anglo Saxon poetry, The Wanderer was erroneously treated as part of the preceding poem Juliana. It was not until 1842 that it was identified as a separate work, in its first print edition, by the pioneering Anglo-Saxonist Benjamin Thorpe. Thorpe considered it to bear \\"considerable evidence of originality\\", but regretted an absence of information on its historical and mythological context. His decision to name it The Wanderer has not always been met with approval. J. R. R. Tolkien, who adopted the poem's Ubi sunt passage (lines 92‚Äì96) into The Lord of the Rings for his Lament for the Rohirrim, is typical of such dissatisfaction. As early as 1926-7 Tolkien was considering the alternative titles 'An Exile', or 'Alone the Banished Man', and by 1964-5 was arguing for 'The Exile's Lament'. Despite such pressure, the poem is generally referred to under Thorpe's original title. =Themes and motifs= A number of formal elements of the poem have been identified by critics, including the use of the \\"beasts of battle\\" motif, the ubi sunt formula, the exile theme, the ruin theme, and the journey motif, as also seen in The Seafarer. The \\"beasts of battle\\" motif, often found in Anglo-Saxon heroic poetry, is here modified to include not only the standard eagle, raven, and wolf, but also a \\"sad-faced man\\". It has been suggested that this is the poem's protagonist. The ubi sunt or \\"where is\\" formula is here in the form h∆ø√¶r c∆øom, the Old English phrase \\"where has gone\\". The use of this emphasises the sense of loss that pervades the poem. =Speech boundaries= A plurality of scholarly opinion holds that the main body of the poem is spoken as monologue, bound between a prologue and epilogue voiced by the poet. For example, lines 1‚Äì5, or 1‚Äì7, and 111-115 can be considered the words of the poet as they refer to the wanderer in the third person, and lines 8-110 as those of a singular individual in the first-person. Alternatively, the entire piece can be seen as a soliloquy spoken by a single speaker. Due to the disparity between the anxiety of the 'wanderer' (anhaga) in the first half and the contentment of the 'wise-man' (snottor) in the second half, others have interpreted it as a dialogue between two distinct personas, framed within the first person prologue and epilogue. An alternative approach grounded in post- structuralist literary theory, and posited by Carol Braun Pasternack identifies a polyphonic series of different speaking positions determined by the subject that the speaker will address.

The original site, some east of Almonte () was abandoned when ground water proved impossible to remove. An abandoned gravel pit outside Carp was selected instead, construction began in 1959 and was completed by 1962. The Carp shelter would be the largest of such facilities (over ) and the only one in the immediate Ottawa area. The underground 4-storey bunker required 32,000 tonnes of concrete and 5,000 tonnes of steel. The structure was capable of withstanding a nuclear blast up to 5 megatons from away. It had massive blast doors at the surface, as well as extensive air filters to prevent radiation infiltration. Although supposedly effective against surface nuclear detonations, the facility was later found to be vulnerable to conventional Bunker buster bombs developed after its construction, as these bombs had time delay fuses that would detonate after they had penetrated deeply enough underground.

Underground storage was built for food, fuel, fresh water, and other supplies. The bunker was built to accommodate 565 people for up to one month without receiving additional supplies from the outside. It included an emergency broadcast studio for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and a vault on the lowest level to hold the gold reserves of the Bank of Canada. These facilities were administered by the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals (later the Communications and Electronics Branch). A decentralized transmitter site, the Richardson Detachment, with numerous transmitter antenna was located further to the west near Perth Ontario that was supported from a 2-storey underground facility of similar construction to the Carp facility but much smaller.

From 1959 to 1994, the site was owned and operated by the Government of Canada, Department of National Defence. After the local municipality took control of the facility in 1994, the community took a great interest in the bunker, requesting access to public tours of the facility. The local municipality took control of the facility and a group of local volunteers, recognizing the heritage and tourism value of the Carp Diefenbunker, undertook to open the facility as a cold war museum and conduct public tours. It was purchased by the Diefenbunker Development Group in 1998, and officially opened as a museum. The name of the facility was changed to the Diefenbunker, Canada's Cold War Museum shortly thereafter. It is currently open year-round for public tours. Many areas of the bunker, including the PM's Suite, the Emergency Government Situation Centre, the CBC Emergency Broadcasting Studio, the Military Federal Warning Centre, the External Affairs Ministerial Office, the Public Works Minister's Office and the Bank of Canada Vault, are being restored to their operational condition. The rest of the 358 rooms have been converted to exhibits of the Cold War era. =Growth of the Museum= Upon its opening in 1998, the museum was run completely by volunteers. However, the 5,000 visitors received that year was too much to be handled solely by volunteers. In 1999, the museum's second year of operation, a curator was hired along with some students. The museum's visitation doubled to 10,000 people that year. The museum continued to grow into the 2000s. Close to 15,000 visitors passed through the Diefenbunker in 2000. Additional part- time staff was hired throughout the year to keep up with museum maintenance and upkeep. As of 2008, the Diefenbunker averages approximately 25,000 visitors each year. Four full-time staff, nine part-time staff and numerous volunteers work to keep the museum running smoothly. In 2012, the museum had 45,280 visitors. This was one of the highest increases in attendance other than the opening year of the Bunker. In 2017, Canada's sesquicentennial, the Diefenbunker welcomed 88,000 visitors through its blast doors. It continues to be one of the best tourist attractions in Ottawa.

The RWL had a number of members active in the New Democratic Party (NDP), while also maintaining a separate public organization and newspaper (therefore they did not consider themselves to be entrists). The party generally endorsed NDP candidates in elections, but ran their own on some occasions, generally in ridings which the NDP did not contest, or had very little chance of winning. Larry Johnston was the sole candidate of the Manitoba branch of the Revolutionary Workers League in the 1977 provincial election, campaigning in the Winnipeg riding of Osborne. He received 47 votes. This appears to have been the only time that the Manitoba RWL endorsed one of its own candidates in a provincial election. It is not clear how long Johnston remained in the RWL after this. During the 1980s, the RWL became divided between Trotskyist supporters of permanent revolution and followers of the American Socialist Workers Party, which after 1982 supported Fidel Castro's Cuba as the vanguard of world revolution.

The manga series was written by Ryo Takamisaki and ran in Shogakukan's CoroCoro Comic between 2001 and 2006. The anime series, produced by Xebec, ran for five seasons on TV Tokyo in Japan between March 2002 and September 2006, reaching episodes in total. Viz Media produced English- language versions of the manga and licensed the first two seasons of the anime. Despite common elements, the stories of the game, anime, and manga versions of the Battle Network series all diverge heavily from each other. Plot The series focuses on Lan Hikari and his NetNavi, MegaMan.EXE as they build their friendship while dealing with threats from various NetCrime organizations. Along with Lan are friends Maylu Sakurai, Dex Ogreon, Yai Ayano, Tory Froid, and their respective Navis: Roll, GutsMan, Glide, IceMan. Although the series originally remains fairly close to the original Battle Network in terms of storyline, it begins to diverge greatly partway into the series. For example, there is no evidence showing that Lan and MegaMan were twin brothers in the anime, unlike in the games where it is revealed near the end of the first Battle Network game. Media =Manga= The MegaMan NT Warrior manga series was written and illustrated by Ryo Takamisaki and published in the Shogakukan magazine CoroCoro Comic. A total of 13 tank≈çbon (bound volumes) were published in Japan from July 2001 to November 2006. All 13 volumes of the series were licensed in North America by Viz Media and published between May 19, 2004 and February 5, 2008. =Anime= The Rockman EXE anime first aired on TV Tokyo March 4, 2002. It spawned four sequels, Rockman EXE Axess, Rockman EXE Stream, Rockman EXE Beast, and Rockman EXE Beast+. The total number of episodes between all 5 series is 209. There was also a feature film within the Stream storyline. Only the first and second (Axess) series were adapted into English. The English adaptation, titled MegaMan NT Warrior, was produced by Viz Media and recorded by Ocean Productions. The series originally aired on Cartoon Network and Kids' WB in the United States and Teletoon in Canada. Axess aired on TV Tokyo in October 2003, while the English adaptation (titled MegaMan NT Warrior: Axess) aired in January 2005 in the United States and April 2005 in Canada. Stream aired on TV Tokyo on October 2, 2004, Beast on October 1, 2005, and Beast+ on April 8, 2006. Kids' WB dropped MegaMan NT Warrior off the TV block at one point and revived only to complete the final episodes from Axess before dropping it again. The anime is for young children in Japan but like many English adaptations of other anime series, MegaMan NT Warrior is edited due to Americanization and censorship. Among the more notable edits made was the editing out of words such as \\"fire,\\" \\"bomb,\\" and \\"napalm,\\" which were thought to be inappropriate for younger viewers (especially post-9/11). As a result, the names of FireMan, ColorMan, BombMan, and NapalmMan also changed (while the original names were retained in the English games). Other inconsistencies between the English game and anime resulted from similarities in name to American superheroes. For example, AquaMan's name was changed to SpoutMan in the English anime to avoid confusion with the DC Comics superhero of the same name. In addition, swords are blurred, and scenes of MegaMan pointing his buster at the screen are removed in earlier seasons. Also, scenes showing a character getting hit in the groin were cut. Curiously, subsequent airings of certain episodes reveal that some of the original edits were changed back‚Äîmost notably, the FireTower Battle Chip originally edited as \\"FlameTower\\" subsequently reverted to \\"FireTower\\". As with WB's other dubbed series (such as Pok√©mon and Cardcaptors), some episodes were aired out of order, edited together, or skipped entirely. Viewers elsewhere saw the series in its entirety in the correct order. The first series (EXE) has been released on DVD and a few earlier volumes on VHS, but in an edited format only. An alternate English-language version aired in Singapore, following the Japanese version more closely. EXE EXE is roughly split into two separate storylines. The first concerns the original WWW (World Three) and Mr. Wily's (Dr. Wily) plan on finding the Ultimate NetNavi, culminating in the N1 Grand Prix, a NetBattling tournament. At its conclusion, the Ultimate NetNavi PharaohMan awakens from his slumber and proceeds to claim the net as his own, deleting MegaMan in the process. PharaohMan would eventually be weakened by the two tournament finalists, Proto Man and a newly rebuilt MegaMan, leading to his capture by Wily. The second half of the season has the characters take on Grave (Gospel), a NetMafia syndicate spearheaded by Wily that seeks to create a virus beast with the capability to destroy the net. The last several episodes of EXE would serve as a lead-in to Axess. Axess Lan's father, Yuichiro Hikari, curiously absent for most of EXE, completes his research on the Synchro Chip, a device that enables Operators and NetNavis to become one through the use of Cross Fusion. This development coincides with a plot by Nebula (led by the notorious Dr. Regal) and the Darkloids (headed by ShadeMan and later Laserman) to take over both the human and cyberworlds. It is at this point that events involving Navis become secondary to the action that takes place in the real world (rather than the cyberworld), which has led critics to label it a generic Henshin (transforming) series. The storyline in Axess is considerably darker, and many EXE regulars make only sporadic appearances. At the beginning of Axess, Lan manages to use the then-untested Synchro Chip to Cross Fuse with MegaMan and defeat the Darkloids that materialize in the real world with the aid of Dimensional Area Generators. Because of this, Lan is invited to become a NetSaver (Net Savior), an Official NetBattler charged with protecting the net. As a result of Cross Fusion, MegaMan loses his Style Change option, but instead gains the ability to use Double Soul (Soul Unison) with which allows him to combine his powers with other NetNavis, harkening back to the original Megaman's Power Copy ability. Cross fusion also multiplies Megaman's power level (For example, the megabuster does much more damage in cross fusion), while making Lan lose his energy. Much of the series is devoted in dealing with the problem of the addictive Dark Chips and the criminal syndicate, Nebula who is controlled by Dr. Regal. Stream Stream continues the storyline set by Axess by introducing Duo, a being from outer space who seeks to destroy humanity after witnessing the chaos caused by Dr. Regal. Intrigued by Cross Fusion, he decides to spare mankind temporarily, bestowing a test upon the main characters to assess whether or not humans truly merit survival. He sends his subordinate, Slur, to Earth, where she hands Navis possessing the powers of Duo's asteroid to unsuspecting people to observe what they will do with such might. Lan (Netto) and the other net saviors must work together to foil Duo and his subordinate. In the process, Neo WWW is formed by Tesla Gauss (Tesla Magnets) to cause havoc. Dr. Regal also returns during the movie, and again towards the end of Stream, with the focus of Stream shifting to time travel. Beast Beast introduces the warring Cybeasts Gregar and Falzar, as well as the Navi Trill. Pitted against the newly emerged Zoanoroid armies of the Cybeasts, Lan, MegaMan, and a select group of their partners, find themselves drawn into the parallel world of Beyondard. Guided by a mysterious girl, Iris, they join the human resistance in the fight to claim the \\"Synchronizer\\" powers of Trill, with which MegaMan is able to \\"Beast Out\\". Nearing the end of Beast, the android brain belonging to Wily of Beyondard reveals himself along with his lackeys, Blackbeard and Yuika, hoping to acquire the victor Cybeast as his new body. Ultimately, the two merge into the Super Cybeast Gregar, which becomes Wily's vessel with assistance from Trill's powers. MegaMan and Trill merge and lend their strength to Lan to form a \\"Juuka Style,\\" giving him the strength to destroy it. Beast+ Beast+ continues from where Beast left off, though it is marketed as a stand-alone series. Episodes are reduced to approximately ten minutes, airing in the thirty-minute time-slot Oha Coliseum alongside the Saru Getchu anime. Beast+ consists of a string of arcs beginning with the appearance of the Professor and Zero (both from Mega Man Network Transmission). An ex-WWW member, the Professor recovers the remains of Gregar, intent on reviving it for his own purposes. Following its deletion and Zero's decision to break ties with his master, the second arc takes place. Stranded in the world that they perceive to be opposite of their own, Blackbeard and Yuika band together with Darkloid BubbleMan, committing various crimes in a Team Rocket-esque fashion. Shortly thereafter, MegaMan gains the abilities of Cross System. Zero then returns in the subsequent arc, befriending both GutsMan and MegaMan. The vengeful Professor, however, also resurfaces, unleashing a new subordinate known as Zero One. Moved by the kindness that has been shown to him, Zero sacrifices himself to put a stop to the Professor once and for all. The storyline then continues toward its finale with the introduction of Cache, the final boss of the Japan-exclusive mobile game Rockman EXE Phantom of Network, who threatens to consume the world with the aid of Phantom Navis and cache data. Beast+ concludes the series, ending September 30, 2006. =Film= The movie, , was shown alongside the Duel Masters feature film, Duel Masters: Curse of the Deathphoenix, as part of a double-billing March 12, 2005 in Japan.

Toys ranged from action figures and plush dolls to board games and trading cards. Many toys were originally released by Bandai, including an electronic Plug-In PET replica of the PET used in the original EXE, but Takara took over with merchandising starting with Axess. Electronic PET toys have since been released with every new model used in the show: Advanced PET and Advanced PET II (Axess), Progress PET (Stream), and Link PET and Link PET_EX (Beast and Beast+). Battle Chips for use in the PETs are often packaged with other merchandise, including action figures and even Japanese installments of Battle Network video games. Most of the merchandise remains Japan-exclusive. However, to help promote the English version of the anime series, Mattel created a line of original MegaMan NT Warrior action figures for the U.S. market. The series were released in two waves with a third wave planned but never released. The action figures featured many prominent characters from the anime with detachable limbs‚Äîinterchangeable with other figures‚Äîso that Battle Chip weaponry could be attached. Mattel also released all twelve DoubleSoul MegaMan figures (featured in Battle Network 4 and Axess) with detachable armor, as well as various miniature figurines (usually depicted in battle) and a few taller figurines, including a talking CrossFusion MegaMan figure. Furthermore, the Advanced PET toy (featured in Axess) was imported in three available designs: blue/gray (MegaMan), red/black (ProtoMan), and black/purple (Bass). The Advanced PET II model was planned but never released. English Battle Chips were packaged with nearly every piece of MegaMan NT Warrior merchandise, but chips could also be bought separately in booster packs. Japanese and English Battle Chips will work on either Japanese or English versions of the PETs, although only the Progress PET featured backwards compatibility with previous generations of Battle Chips. In 2004, Decipher also distributed a trading card game in the United States called \\"MegaMan NT Warrior Trading Card Game\\". However, it was not a translation of the pre-existing trading card games in Japan. Three sets were released before the game was discontinued in 2005, after the end of the Mega Man Battle Network video games. In Japan, various soundtracks have been released featuring background music and theme songs used in the show. Also, every episode of the anime has been released across sixty-five DVDs usually containing three episodes per disc. In the United States, thirteen DVDs have been released covering the original 52 episodes of EXE. The first six volumes were also released in VHS form. The English version of Axess has yet to be released on DVD. Other merchandise includes a life-sized Mega Buster that fires foam darts, an original MegaMan NT Warrior-themed board game, and MegaMan.EXE Halloween costumes. Reception MegaMan NT Warrior achieved popularity among Japanese viewing audiences. According to a viewership sample conducted in the Kant≈ç region by Video Research, the anime drew in an average of 4.5% and a maximum of 5.9% of households during the last year of its original run.

It was later ported to the Dreamcast console. The player controls a giant robot which is used to fight another robot in one-on-one combat. Studio Nue (the animation studio responsible for the mechanical designs for the mecha anime series The Super Dimension Fortress Macross) designed the robots in this game. Story The setting of Tech Romancer takes place in a far future of Earth, where advanced technology have made things calm and decent for the citizens of Japan and the rest of the world. However, the peace doesn't last long as an evil alien tyrant named Goldibus invades the planet with its loyal followers and seeks to conquer the world while enslaving the human race with an emotionless iron fist. An unlikely group of heroes band together to fight against the threat of Goldibus with their own unique mecha robots and all of them won't rest until Goldibus is defeated and the world is safe from the imminent danger. Game modes The game is primarily played in two modes: Story Mode, and Hero Challenge Mode. The Dreamcast version also had minigames that could be played on the VMU for points. A screenshot from Tech Romancer's gameplay. =Story Mode= Each mecha has its own story mode, which plays out like an anime series, with each battle broken up by an episode title, eyecatch, and dialog scenes before and after each battle. Each mecha has its own story (where it is the star of its own show), and decisions made in the dialog scenes, as well as the conditions under which a battle is won, can cause some stories to branch out and have multiple paths and endings. The other mecha and characters naturally make appearances, but their role may vary from their actual origins to fit the \\"star\\" mecha's story. =Hero Challenge Mode= An \\"Arcade-style\\" mode where the player fights through each of the major mecha and bosses. Various hidden mecha and pilots found in the game can only be used in Hero Challenge Mode. In the Dreamcast version, points earned in Hero Challenge Mode and the VMU minigames could be used to purchase hidden characters including boss characters and movies. =Matching Service= In Japan, the game is re- released as \\"Choukou Senki Kikaioh For Matching Service\\" because of its online functionality. Gameplay Battles take place mostly on a flat 3D plane, with buildings and other terrain features scattered around. Destroying the terrain (by attacking or walking through them) releases power-ups, which include three weapons (vary between each character/mecha), armor or life powerups, and the Hero Mode powerup, which increases the power of your mecha's attacks, and may also unlock additional abilities or moves. Rather than rounds, the matches are decided by the life meters of the fighters. Each fighter has two life meters, and is destroyed when the second one is depleted. In addition, each mecha gets an armor gauge that, when broken by consistent brute attacks, lowers the mecha's defense and makes it harder to recover from attacks received. Each mecha has at least two super attacks, as well as a Final Attack, which is usable when the opponent is down to the last 50% of their second lifebar. This attack, when activated and successfully connected, automatically destroys the opponent, winning the battle. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Tech Romancer on their November 1, 1998 issue as being the sixth most-successful arcade game of the year. Greg Orlando reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"It's not often when we get to step into our favorite anime and beat some metal ass. Now if only the fighting were as inspired as the off-the-wall anime plot...\\" The Dreamcast version received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 29 out of 40.

Career Brown was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1896, where he and his future partner, John Bakewell Jr. (1872‚Äì1963), also a member of Beta Theta Pi, were both prot√©g√©s of famed Bay Area architect Bernard Maybeck. Brown went to Paris and graduated from the √âcole des Beaux- Arts in 1901, attending the atelier of Victor Laloux, before returning to San Francisco to establish his practice with Bakewell in 1905. Their first commissions included the interior of the City of Paris department store and the city hall for Berkeley, California, before entering the competition for the 1915 San Francisco City Hall for which they are best known. Brown also designed the city's War Memorial Opera House and Veterans Building, the former in collaboration with G. Albert Lansburgh. Brown was meticulously trained in the rigorous Beaux-Arts tradition, and in the City Hall project his attention extended to the smallest details of light fixtures, floor patterning and doorknobs. War Memorial Opera House, San Francisco In addition to their well- known monumental works, Bakewell and Brown designed several homes in the Arts and Crafts style championed by Maybeck. Early among them were two redwood framed \\"double houses\\" for Stanford University in 1908, and the only fraternity house they designed de novo, the Beta Chi Chapter House of Sigma Nu in 1910 (razed by the University in 1991 despite student and alumni efforts to give it historic designation and restore it). They later designed additions to Ernest Coxhead's 1893 Beta Theta Pi house they had lived in as undergraduates, now a listed Berkeley landmark. The firm went on to design a series of familiar San Francisco landmarks, and many buildings at Stanford University, before Brown dissolved the partnership in 1927. For contractual reasons many buildings at Stanford through the 1930s continued to be credited to both. Bakewell and Brown also designed the Byzantine-inspired Temple Emmanuel (1926) at Lake St. and Arguello Blvd. in San Francisco, and the Pasadena City Hall (1927).,http://www.ci.pasadena.ca.us/City_Hall.aspx Most of Brown's later San Francisco works employed a stripped-down classicism. The poured-concrete Art Moderne Coit Tower (1932), that crowns Telegraph Hill is an important Modernist landmark in the Bay Area. Coit Tower was the site of some of the first public works murals executed under the Public Works Administration, later known as the WPA. \\"The primitive nature of Coit Tower would lend itself better to that sort of thing than other public buildings,\\" was Arthur Brown's first reaction to the project. Diego Rivera included Brown among the designers and craftsmen in his fresco mural of The Making of a Fresco Showing the Building of a City (1931). San Francisco City Hall, completed 1915 In Washington, D. C. Brown designed the Interstate Commerce Commission Building, its near-twin the Department of Labor Building, and the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium. All three form part of the Federal Triangle, the largest construction project undertaken by the US Federal government prior to The Pentagon. Preliminary designs were begun in 1927, with construction in the Depression years between 1932 and 1934. The new buildings were to be designed to reflect the \\"dignity and power of the nation.\\" Brown's last works were primarily at UC Berkeley, where Brown served as campus planner and chief architect from 1936 to 1950. His principal buildings there include Sproul Hall, the Bancroft Library, and the Cyclotron Building,https://commons.lbl.gov/download/attachments/76187570/LBNL-Vision- Plan-Feb09.pdf?version=1&modificationDate;=1316823566912 commissioned by Ernest Lawrence and J.

Origins The surname Hyndman has two origins. First, it may be an occupational surname, either from (\\"farm labourer\\") + , or a variant of . Second, it may have originated from a nickname, possibly (\\"courteous\\") + . Variant spellings include Hindman. Early records of bearers of the surname include a Hector Hyndman of Renfewshire in the Exchequer Rolls of Scotland for 1553. The Scottish Register of Tartans lists three tartans for families named Hyndman. Two are restricted tartans: one for the family of Captain Henry Hyndman (1785‚Äì1849) with roots in Macau and Hong Kong; the other for the family of Daniel Hyndman in Edinburgh and Ontario. The third, created for C. P. Hyndman (stated to be \\"the first Hyndman to record arms in the Lyon Register since 1672\\"), has a design chosen to reflect his family's association with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the town of Paisley, and by C. P. Hyndman's wishes is available for all bearers of the surname born in Northern Ireland. Statistics The 1881 United Kingdom census found 338 bearers of the surname Hyndman, primarily in the west of Scotland. Statistics compiled by Patrick Hanks on the basis of the 2011 United Kingdom census and 2011 Ireland census showed 718 bearers of the surname on the island of Great Britain and 367 on the island of Ireland. In the United States, the 2010 Census found 1,054 people with the surname Hyndman, making it the 23,943rd-most-common surname in the country. This represented an increase from 1,038 (22,999th-most-common) in the 2000 Census. In both censuses, roughly nine-tenths of people with this surname identified as non-Hispanic White, and roughly six percent as non-Hispanic Black or African American.

Over 10,000 titles (green), over 5,000 (yellow), over 1,000 (blue) The term World cinema is not the sum-total of all films made around the world. Rather, it is analogous to the use of the term \\"World literature\\". Johann Wolfgang von Goethe used the concept Weltliteratur in the early 19th century, to describe the international circulation and reception of literary works across Europe. His definition also included works of non-European authorship. Similarly, an interest in \\"world cinema\\" suggests an awareness of cinematic production, apart from the Hollywood Studio System which dominates international viewership. The term is oft used to refer the film and film industries of both English-Speaking and the Non-English-Speaking world. Therefore, equating a dominant form of cinema with its dominant language (E.g. Labeling Hollywood Film Production as English Cinema), is inaccurate and misleading. Furthermore, English films are produced across a varied geography, representing a diverse range of countries and cultures, across all continents; E.g. Canada in North America, England in Europe, South Africa in Africa, India in Asia and Australia. Yet, due to their marginal status in terms of access or viewership, they are included under the umbrella of \\"world cinema\\". Arguably, the understanding of \\"world cinema\\" as a complement of Hollywood cinema maybe a Eurocentric interpretation. Alternatively, the term foreign film is used as a synonym. \\"Foreign\\" is also a relative term, suggestive of a Western viewpoint. One person's national cinema can be another's foreign film. In fact, American independent cinema may be considered part of \\"world cinema\\" as it does not have the global, dominate or even adequate access, available to the American Hollywood cinema. Technically, foreign film does not mean the same as foreign language film, but the implication is that a foreign film is not only foreign in terms of the country of production, but also in terms of the language used. Thus, the use of the term foreign film for films produced in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, India, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, or other English-speaking countries would be uncommon within other English- speaking countries. Types World cinema has an unofficial implication of films with \\"artistic value\\" as opposed to \\"Hollywood commercialism.\\" Foreign language films are often grouped with \\"art house films\\" and other independent films in DVD stores, cinema listings etc. Unless dubbed into one's native language, foreign language films played in English-speaking regions usually have English subtitles. Few films of this kind receive more than a limited release and many are never played in major cinemas. As such the marketing, popularity and gross takings for these films are usually markedly less than for typical Hollywood blockbusters. The combination of subtitles and minimal exposure adds to the notion that \\"World Cinema\\" has an inferred artistic prestige or intelligence, which may discourage less sophisticated viewers. Additionally, differences in cultural style and tone between foreign and domestic films affects attendance at cinemas and DVD sales.Curran, Daniel. Foreign Films: More than 500 films on video cassette, pages v-vi. Evanston, Illinois: CineBooks, 1989. Foreign language films can be commercial, low brow or B-movies. Furthermore, foreign language films can cross cultural boundaries, particularly when the visual spectacle and style is sufficient to overcome people's misgivings. Films of this type became more common in the early 2000s, as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Am√©lie, Brotherhood of the Wolf, Y Tu Mama Tambien and Talk to Her enjoyed great successes in United States cinemas and home video sales. The first foreign and foreign language film to top the North American box office was Hero in August 2004. \\"The rule for foreign-language films is that if you've done $5 million or better (in United States cinemas), you've had a very nice success; if you do $10 (million) or better (in United States cinemas), you're in blockbuster category,\\" Warner Independent Pictures ex-president Mark Gill said. On the other hand, English-dubbed foreign films rarely did well in United States box office (except Anime films). The 1982 United States theatrical release of Wolfgang Peterson's Das Boot was the last major release to go out in both original and English-dubbed versions, and the film's original version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version. Later on, English-dubbed versions of international hits like Un indien dans la ville, Godzilla 2000, Anatomy, Pinocchio and High Tension flopped at United States box office. When Miramax planned to release the English-dubbed versions of Shaolin Soccer and Hero in the United States cinemas, their English-dubbed versions scored badly in test screenings in the United States, so Miramax finally released the films in United States cinemas with their original language. On DVD Foreign language films that are particularly successful in international markets may be taken on by the large film distribution companies for DVD releases. At the other end of the scale, many foreign language films are never given a DVD release outside of their home markets. The majority of those DVDs that are given an international release, come out on specialist labels. These labels include: * Arrow Films (UK) - Label specialising in foreign language and cult English language films * Artificial Eye (US and UK) * Axiom Films (UK) * British Film Institute (UK) * Contender Entertainment Group - Label distributing East Asian films.

The film was directed by Russ Meyer and co-written by Meyer and Roger Ebert. Originally intended as a sequel to the 1967 film Valley of the Dolls‚Äî\\"dolls\\" being a slang term for depressant pills or \\"downers\\"‚ÄîBeyond the Valley of the Dolls was instead revised as a parody of the commercially successful but critically reviled original. Plot Three young women ‚Äî Kelly MacNamara, Casey Anderson, and Petronella \\"Pet\\" Danforth ‚Äî perform in a rock band, the Kelly Affair, managed by Harris Allsworth, Kelly's boyfriend. The four travel to Los Angeles to find Kelly's estranged aunt, Susan Lake, heiress to a family fortune. After Susan promises Kelly a third of her inheritance, Porter Hall, her sleazy financial advisor, discredits Kelly as a \\"hippie\\" to dissuade Susan from dividing the fortune he secretly wants to embezzle. Undeterred, Susan introduces the Kelly Affair to a flamboyant, well-connected rock producer, Ronnie \\"Z-Man\\" Barzell, who coaxes them into an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties (after a set by real-life band Strawberry Alarm Clock). The band is so well-received that becomes their svengali manager, changing their name to the Carrie Nations and starting a long-simmering feud with Harris. Kelly drifts away from Harris and dates Lance Rocke, a high-priced gigolo, who has his own designs on her inheritance. After losing Kelly, Harris is seduced by the sexually aggressive porn star Ashley St. Ives. She soon tires of his conventional nature and waning libido due to increasing drug and alcohol intake.

Production =Development= Beyond the Valley of the Dolls was originally intended as a straightforward sequel to the 1967 film Valley of the Dolls. Jacqueline Susann, author of the novel Valley of the Dolls, had come up with the title while she was writing her second novel The Love Machine. She wrote a treatment and in June 1968 it was reported Fox wanted Dorothy Kingsley to write a screenplay but she was busy on Bracken's World.Channing 'Frizzy' in Next Opus Chicago Tribune 24 June 1968: b10. In November, it was reported that Barbara Parkins would return in the film, but Patty Duke and Sharon Tate would not.Smog Gets the Blame Again NORMA LEE BROWNING. Chicago Tribune 20 Nov 1968: b1. In June 1969 Fox announced the film would be made in the next 18 months and would come from Irving Manfield Productions.20 FILMS SCHEDULED FOR SHOOTING AT FOX Los Angeles Times 23 June 1969: c18. A script was written by Jean Holloway.Some New Faces in Crowd at Warner's Haber, Joyce. Los Angeles Times 20 Aug 1969: e17. =Russ Meyer= In August 1969 Fox announced that the film would no longer be made by Irving Mansfield. Instead they had hired Russ Meyer, whose recent movie Vixen had been a massive commercial success. Holloway's script was discarded and the film critic Roger Ebert took a five- week leave of absence from the Chicago Sun-Times to write a script. Parkins was no longer attached to the film.MOVE CALL SHEET: Director for 'Dolls' Sequel Martin, Betty. Los Angeles Times 26 Aug 1969: d17. Meyer said Richard Zanuck, head of Fox, gave him a weekend to come up with an idea of how it could be done \\"stressing budget strongly in line with the whole ideas of making movies more cheaply\\" and encouraging him to \\"make an R film smashing against an X rating.\\" Meyer wanted to use his own writer, the critic Roger Ebert. =Script= Meyer says he and Ebert wrote a 127-page treatment in 10 days and the script in three weeks. Neither of them had read the novel but they watched the 1967 film and used the same formula: Three young girls come to Hollywood, find fame and fortune, are threatened by sex, violence, and drugs, and either do or do not win redemption,\\" according to Ebert. He later added \\"We would include some of the sensational elements of the original story- homosexuality, crippling diseases, characters based on \\"real\\" people, events out of recent headlines- but, again, with flat-out exaggeration.\\"RUSS MEYER: King of the Nudies Ebert, Roger. Film Comment; New York Vol. 9, Iss. 1, (Jan/Feb 1973): 35-46. The script was not only a spoof of the original film, but also, in Ebert's words, \\"a satire of Hollywood conventions, genres, situations, dialogue, characters, and success formulas, heavily overlaid with such shocking violence that some critics didn't know whether the movie 'knew' it was a comedy\\".Ebert, Roger. \\"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\\" on the Roger Ebert's Film Festival website, comments originally written for Film Comment in 1980. Ebert said the plot was derived in collaboration \\"by creating characters and then working out situations to cover the range of exploitable content we wanted in the film. Meyer wanted the film to appeal, in some way, to almost anyone who was under thirty and went to the movies. There had to be music, mod clothes, black characters, violence, romantic love, soap opera situations, behind-the-scenes intrigue, fantastic sets, lesbians, orgies, drugs and (eventually) an ending that tied everything together.\\" Meyer's intention was for the film to \\"simultaneously be a satire, a serious melodrama, a rock musical, a comedy, a violent exploitation picture, a skin flick, and a moralistic expose (so soon after the Sharon Tate murders) of what the opening crawl called 'the oft-times nightmarish world of Show Business'\\". Ebert later recalled: > At the time we were working on BVD I didn't really understand how unusual > the project was. But in hindsight I can recognize that the conditions of its > making were almost miraculous. An independent X-rated filmmaker and an > inexperienced screenwriter were brought into a major studio and given carte > blanche to turn out a satire of one of the studio's own hits. And BVD was > made at a time when the studio's own fortunes were so low that the movie was > seen almost fatalistically, as a gamble that none of the more respectable > studio executives really wanted to think about, so that there was a minimum > of supervision (or even cognizance) from the Front Office.Russ Meyer: Ten > Years After the 'Beyond' Ebert, Roger. Film Comment; New York Vol. 16, Iss. > 4, (Jul/Aug 1980): 43-48,80. Meyer submitted the script to Richard Zanuck at Fox in September and Zanuck greenlit the film.Character Actor to Star Los Angeles Times 13 Sep 1969: a9. Meyer said when Fox offered him the film \\"I felt like I had pulled off the biggest caper in the world.\\"King of the Nudies on Biggest Film Caper Yet Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times 30 Nov 1969: s18. He described the film as \\"a soap opera for young people, a cornocopia of wild, way-out now entertainment.\\" =Character influences= Roger Ebert revealed that many of the film's themes and characters were based upon real people and events, but because neither Ebert nor Russ Meyer actually met these people, their characterizations were based on pure speculation. *Ronnie \\"Z-Man\\" Barzell ‚Äì The fictional eccentric rock producer turned Carrie Nations manager was loosely based on real-life producer Phil Spector. More than three decades later, Spector was convicted of murder after the body of Lana Clarkson was found at his mansion, which is somewhat reminiscent of the events of the film's climax. *Randy Black ‚Äì The heavyweight champ character was loosely based on the real World Heavyweight Champion Muhammad Ali. *The climactic, violent ending, which was not in the original script, was inspired by the real-life Tate-LaBianca murders perpetrated by the Manson family. The film began production on December 2, 1969, shortly after the murders, which were covered heavily by the media.McDonough 2006 pp.257, 262 Valley of the Dolls star Sharon Tate was among the murder victims, as was Jay Sebring. Vocalist Lynn Carey, who was dating Sebring and had been invited to join him the night of the Tate-LaBianca murders, refused his invitation, according to her comments on the DVD extras. * Porter Hall ‚Äì This scheming lawyer shares the name of a character actor who often played movie villains.McDonough 2006 p.271 * Susan Lake and Baxter Wolfe were, in an original draft script, Anne Welles and Lyon Burke from Valley of the Dolls. Their back-story stated in BVD (\\"He proposed to her but it was the wrong time\\", \\"It's been three years...\\"), matches the ending of the original. Following Jacqueline Susann's legal-action proceedings against 20th Century Fox, the characters were renamed and recast. Barbara Parkins, who played Anne, was originally under contract to appear in BVD and was disappointed when she was abruptly removed from the project. The special edition DVD features a screen test with Michael Blodgett and Cynthia Myers enacting the bedroom scene between Lance and Kelly. Obviously based on an early script, the dialogue has them make reference to Anne Welles, not Susan Lake, as Kelly's Aunt. =Casting= The cast was composed almost entirely of unknowns. \\"Valley of the Dolls plus my own name will be enough,\\" said Meyer. Meyer said even if Parkins had wanted to do the film they would not have used her. \\"She would cost us too much money.\\"Oh, Those Beautiful Dolls! By ALJEAN HARMETZHOLLYWOOD.. New York Times 21 Dec 1969: D17. Cynthia Myers was a playboy playmate hired to play one of the girls who realizes she's a lesbian. \\"It's a loving and tender thing,\\" Myers said of the film's depiction of her sexuality. \\"It's not The Killing of Sister George.\\"Cynthia's Fate: Poster A Commentary By Nicholas von Hoffman. The Washington Post, Times Herald 06 Nov 1969: D1. Edy Williams was under contract to Fox at the time. Pam Grier made her film debut as an extra in a party scene.PAM GRIER IS SHEDDING HER REDUNDANT IMAGE Hunt, Dennis. Los Angeles Times 12 Mar 1981: h1. =Shooting= Meyer and Ebert kept the costs down by writing \\"97 percent of the film\\" for existing sets on the Fox backlot. Ebert said that Beyond the Valley of the Dolls seemed \\"like a movie that got made by accident when the lunatics took over the asylum\\". Ebert says Meyer \\"directed his actors with a poker face, solemnly discussing the motivations behind each scene. Some of the actors asked me whether their dialogue wasn't supposed to be humorous, but Meyer discussed it so seriously with them that they hesitated to risk offending him by voicing such a suggestion. The result is that BVD has a curious tone all of its own... from actors directed at right angles to the material.\\" Because the film was put together so quickly, some plot decisions, such as the character Z-Man being revealed as a woman in drag, were made on the spot, without the chance to bring previous already-shot scenes into alignment with the new development. As they were shooting, the cast was uncertain whether the dialogue was intended to be comic or not, which would alter their approach to acting it. Because Meyer always discussed their roles and the film so seriously, they did not want to unintentionally insult him by asking, so they broached the question to Ebert, instead. Meyer's intention was to have the actors perform the material in a straightforward manner, saying \\"If the actors perform as if they know they have funny lines, it won't work.\\" Ebert described the resulting tone as \\"curious\\". In 1980, Ebert looked back on the film and said of it: > I think of it as an essay on our generic expectations. It's an anthology of > stock situations, characters, dialogue, clich√©s and stereotypes, set to > music and manipulated to work as exposition and satire at the same time; > it's cause and effect, a wind-up machine to generate emotions, pure movie > without message. =Editing= Initially the film was given an X rating by the MPAA; in 1990, it was reclassified as NC-17. Meyer's response to the original X rating was to attempt to re-edit the film to insert more nudity and sex, but Fox wanted to get the movie released quickly and would not give him the time. =Music and soundtrack= Most of the film's music was written by Stu Phillips. Phillips adapted Paul Dukas' The Sorcerer's Apprentice for the psychedelic scene at Z-Man's house near the film's end.Beyond the Valley of the Dolls: The Original Soundtrack. Liner notes from audio CD. Stu Phillips and Alex Patterson. Harkit: HRKCD 8032, 2003 Members of the fictitious Carrie Nations neither sing nor play their own instruments in the film. Vocals for the lip-synced songs were performed by Lynn Carey (Mama Lion), a blue-eyed soul singer based in Los Angeles, together with Barbara Robison, the lead singer of Peanut Butter Conspiracy. Carey's and Robison's voices are showcased on the apocalyptic rocker \\"Find It\\" (by Stu Phillips and Carey), the earnest folk anthem \\"Come With the Gentle People\\" (by Stu Phillips and Bob Stone), the raunchy R&B; of \\"Sweet Talking Candyman\\" (by Phillips and Stone), the lilting ballad \\"In the Long Run\\" (by Phillips and Stone), and the soulful strut of \\"Look On Up At the Bottom\\" (also by Phillips and Stone). She also sings \\"Once I had Love\\", written by Stu Phillips and herself. Strawberry Alarm Clock performed their 1967 hit \\"Incense and Peppermints\\", the mid-tempo rocker \\"Girl from the City\\" (written by Paul Marshall), and the power pop anthem \\"I'm Comin' Home\\" (also by Marshall) during the first party scene at Z-Man's house. The film's title song was performed by A&M; artists The Sandpipers and is heard twice near the end of the movie. The group released the song as a single and on their 1970 Come Saturday Morning LP. Different versions of the soundtrack album exist because of disputes over royalties. The original vinyl soundtrack, reissued in the early 2000s, substitutes Ami Rushes' vocals for Lynn Carey's originals, and includes one song, \\"Once I Had Love\\", not on the 2003 CD reissue. However, the CD edition of the soundtrack (Soundtrack Classics SCL 1408 and Harkit Records HRKCD 8032) contains 25 songs compared to the 12 songs on the vinyl version, with the original film versions plus Lynn Carey and Barbara Robison bonus tracks. Both labels also released vinyl editions with different covers and extended songs compared to the 1970 LP. The song \\"Once I Had A Love\\" was released on the CD Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls/Groupie Girl (Screen Gold Records SGLDCD00010) along with the songs from the LP from 1970. The CD does not contain the original film versions, only the new recordings for the LP from 1970, with four songs by Ami Rushes and two by Barbara Robison. For the first time, all original film song versions are included, with original versions sung by Carey and Robison. \\"Incense and Peppermints\\", some incidental music, and the Strawberry Alarm Clock's Hammond organ instrumental \\"Toy Boy\\" are missing from all soundtrack releases. =Box office= Despite an X rating and a modest budget of $900,000, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls grossed 10 times that amount in the U.S. market, qualifying it as a hit for Fox. It has since grossed more than $40 million from theatrical revivals and video sales, according to Roger Ebert. According to Variety, the film earned $6,800,000 in theatrical rentals in North America by 1976.\\"All-time Film Rental Champs\\", Variety, 7 January 1976 p 44 According to Fox records the film required $4,100,000 in rentals to break even and by 11 December 1970 had made $7,000,000 so made a profit to the studio. Critical reception and legacy The film was initially critically panned. Upon release, Ebert's future TV co- host Gene Siskel gave the film zero stars out of four, writing in the Chicago Tribune that the film \\"unfolds with all of the humor and excitement of a padded bra ... Boredom aplenty is provided by a screenplay which for some reason has been turned over to a screenwriting neophyte.\\" He later put it on his list of the 20 worst films of the year. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"comes off with a slightly higher rating\\" than the original Valley of the Dolls book and movie, but thought that by \\"quite consciously attempting to parody his earlier movies\\" Meyer had \\"become patronizing.\\" Variety wrote that it was \\"not much of a film. Producer-director Russ Meyer, who once made low-budget sex pix which had a crude and innocuous charm but not much of a story, this time around spent between 20 and 30 times the money he used to have, and got less for it.\\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times panned the film as a \\"a treat for the emotionally retarded, sexually inadequate and dimwitted. It is a grievously sick melange of hypermammalian girls, obvious double-entendres and sadistic violence.\\"Champlin, Charles (June 18, 1970). \\"Sexploiteer Hitchhikes on 'Dolls' Title\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post declared it \\"a mess, a disaster, a stinkeroo, the most wretched of wretched movies,\\" adding, \\"Disregard anything you hear in the so- bad-it's-good or it's-all-a-put-on veins. It's a depressing picture ‚Äî witless, hysterical, gratuitous, technically inept, needlessly brutal.\\" Mike Wallington of The Monthly Film Bulletin called it \\"corny, moralising, guileless, and visually about as appealing as a Christmas wrapper. It is also perversely enjoyable if one is prepared to laugh at it as well as with it.\\" Since its release in 1970, the film has acquired a cult following and has even been included in various \\"best of\\" lists by movie critics. The reviews have improved to become more mixed at the present, with critics agreeing it was much better than the film it parodied. In 2000, Canadian magazine Take One included it in their \\"Best Films of the 1970s\\" critics poll.Best Films of the 1970s In 2001, the Village Voice named the film #87 on its list of the 100 Greatest Films of the Century. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 75% from 28 reviews.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beyond_the_valley_of_the_dolls Lawsuit from Jacqueline Susann Jacqueline Susann, author of the unconnected novel Valley of the Dolls, later sued Fox for $10 million for damaging her reputation by making the film, saying it was \\"sex exploitation film, employs total nudity and is scandalous of content.\\"Susann Suing. The Washington Post, Times Herald 28 Apr 1970: B16. As a result, the studio placed a disclaimer at the beginning of the film informing the audience that the two films were not intended to be connected. Posters for the movie read, \\"This is not a sequel‚Äîthere has never been anything like it\\". The suit did not go to trial until after Susann's death in September 1974. Her estate won a $2 million verdict against the studio in August 1975. The production of the film, along with Myra Breckinridge, helped lead to the ousting of Richard Zanuck from Fox.Dissidents Plan Proxy Battle for Fox Control: Lawyer, N.Y.

He served as president of three major American universities: Kansas State University, Pennsylvania State University, and Johns Hopkins University. He was the younger brother of U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Early life and education He was born in Abilene, Kansas, to Ida Elizabeth Stover (1862‚Äì1946) and David Jacob Eisenhower (1863‚Äì1942); the family was poor. Eisenhower attended public schools and graduated from Kansas State University in 1923 with a BS degree in industrial journalism.  Career  =U.S. Department of Agriculture= Eisenhower served as Director of Information for the U.S. Department of Agriculture from 1928 to 1941, where he was a spokesman for the New Deal. He also was a key member of the Department of Agriculture's Employee Organization: Organization of Professional Employees of the United States Department of Agriculture (OPEDA). =World War II= Early in 1942, he was appointed director of the War Relocation Authority, the U.S. government agency responsible for the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Eisenhower was opposed to the mass incarceration, and at initial meetings with pro-exclusion officials he suggested allowing women and children to remain on the West Coast, but the proposal was rejected. In his position as WRA director, he attempted to mitigate the consequences of the \\"evacuation,\\" establishing a Japanese American advisory council with Mike Masaoka, a work program that allowed some Japanese Americans to leave camp for employment on labor-starved farms, and a student leave program that allowed Nisei who had been enrolled in college to continue their education. He also tried to get the Federal Reserve Bank to protect the property Japanese Americans were forced to leave behind, and to convince governors of states outside the exclusion zone to allow Japanese Americans to resettle there, but these efforts were largely unsuccessful. In the 1943 government propaganda film, Japanese Relocation he said, \\"This picture tells how the mass migration was accomplished. Neither the Army, not the War Relocation Authority relish the idea of taking men, women and children from their homes, their shops and their farms. So, the military and civilian agencies alike determined to do the job as a democracy should - with real consideration for the people involved.\\" Eisenhower resigned after only ninety days, and from June 1942 to mid-1943 he was associate director of the Office of War Information.Niiya, Brian. \\"Milton Eisenhower\\" Densho Encyclopedia.

During this time, he also served as the first Chairman of the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO. In this role, Eisenhower sought to also establish UNESCO commissions for each state. He personally organized the first such commission, in Kansas. He also sought to create more opportunity for African Americans at Kansas State, pushing for the racial integration of the Big Seven Conference (later Big Eight Conference) in 1949.Baker, S Zebulon, \\"'To help foster athletic equality here in the Midwest': Defeating Jim Crow in the Big Seven Conference.\\" Kansas History 39:2 (2016): 74‚Äì93. http://www.kshs.org/publicat/history/2016summer_baker.pdf Eisenhower was often referred to as \\"Doctor.\\" However, he did not hold an earned doctoral degree; instead, he had received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from the University of Nebraska in 1949.http://nebraska.edu/recognition-and- awards/honorary-degrees/alphabetical.html , Accessed 8-19-09 After leaving Kansas State University in 1950, Eisenhower served as president at two other universities: Pennsylvania State University from 1950 to 1956 and Johns Hopkins University from 1956 to 1967 and 1971 to 1972. In July 1956, Milton Eisenhower assumed the presidency of Johns Hopkins University, succeeding Lowell J. Reed. During Eisenhower's first term, University income tripled and the endowment doubled. More than $76 million in new buildings were constructed, including the Milton S. Eisenhower Library, completed in 1964 and named for Eisenhower in 1965. Respected and admired by faculty and students alike, Eisenhower was arguably the most popular Hopkins president since Daniel Coit Gilman. He kept office hours when any student could drop in, and he was welcome at students' off-campus parties. When Eisenhower retired in 1967, he was given the title president emeritus in recognition of his service. In March 1971, after Lincoln Gordon's abrupt resignation, the trustees asked Eisenhower to return until a permanent successor could be found. He reluctantly agreed to return, making it clear that the search for a permanent successor must begin immediately. His second administration, lasting ten months, required him to reduce a large deficit and slow the growth of the University's administration. His reputation for fairness helped greatly in that turbulent time, and, despite the budgetary problems, he was able to push forward with planning and design for a new student center. In January 1972, he was succeeded as president by Steven Muller, who (although hired by Lincoln Gordon) had served a ten-month \\"apprenticeship\\" under Eisenhower as vice president and provost. Eisenhower enjoyed a second active retirement until his death on May 2, 1985.Ambrose, Stephen E. and Richard H. Immerman, Milton S. Eisenhower: Educational Statesman (Baltimore, 1983) =Political career= He served as a presidential adviser in the administrations of his brother Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953‚Äì1961), John F. Kennedy (1961‚Äì1963) and Lyndon B. Johnson (1963‚Äì1969). In 1968, he was appointed chairman of the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence by President Johnson. Milton Eisenhower, Eleanor Roosevelt, Walter Reuther, and the Cuban prisoner exchange delegation in Washington, D.C. Following the Bay of Pigs in 1961, President Kennedy asked Eisenhower, Eleanor Roosevelt, and labor leader Walter Reuther to negotiate the release of captured Americans with Cuban leader Fidel Castro. In 1980, Eisenhower appeared on the ballot in Texas as the running mate of Congressman John B. Anderson, Independent candidate for President of the United States. Personal life On October 12, 1927, Eisenhower married Helen Elsie Eakin (1904‚Äì1954), with whom he had a son, Milton Stover Eisenhower, Jr., in 1930 and a daughter, Ruth Eakin Eisenhower, in 1938. While attending college at Kansas State University, Eisenhower was a member of the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Eisenhower died of cancer in Baltimore, Maryland on May 2, 1985.  Legacy  * The Milton S. Eisenhower Library of Johns Hopkins University, opened in 1964 and containing 2.5 million volumes, is named after him. It has the unusual feature of being almost entirely underground (because of the slope of the site where it was built). The south wall is entirely windows. * The primary research facility at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory was previously named the Milton S. Eisenhower Research Center (now the Research and Exploratory Development Department). * The Milton S. Eisenhower Auditorium, a 2,595-seat center for the performing arts on the University Park campus of Penn State, opened in 1974. Eisenhower Chapel, on the same campus, is named for his wife, Helen Eakin Eisenhower. * Eisenhower Hall, opened in 1951 on the Kansas State campus, is also named in his honor. It is home to the College of Arts and Sciences dean's office and the departments of History and Modern Languages. The Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium is an acclaimed, student-organized lecture series founded in 1967 at Johns Hopkins University. All events take place on the Homewood campus in Shriver Hall and are free and open to the public. Further reading * Ambrose, Stephen E., and Richard H. Immerman, Milton S.

It was released by Nintendo on February 1, 1995, in Europe and on April 25, 1995, in North America for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is a Western release of the Japanese Super Puyo Puyo. There was not a Japanese release, and the game remains the only Kirby title not released there. Gameplay Kirby's Avalanche pits players against either computer-controlled or player-controlled opponents. See also: Gameplay of Puyo Puyo In the game, groups of two colored blobs fall from the top of the screen. The player must rotate and move the groups before they touch the bottom of the screen or the pile, so that matching-colored blobs touch from above, below, the left or the right. Once four or more same-colored blobs touch, they will disappear, and any blobs above them will fall down to fill in space. If a player manages to set off a chain reaction with these blobs, rocks will fall on the other player's screen, filling it up and giving them less room to drop additional blobs. The number of rocks that falls depends on both the number of blobs popped and the number of consecutive chain reactions. These rocks will only disappear if a player manages to pop a group of blobs that are in direct contact with the rocks. A player will lose if either of the middle columns in the top row is filled with a blob or rock. Plot King Dedede has challenged Kirby and other members of Dream Land to an Avalanche Competition at the Fountain of Dreams. Kirby decides to take on the challenge, battling his way through the forest in Avalanche matches against an assortment of his old foes from Kirby's Dream Land and Kirby's Adventure (including recurring bosses such as Whispy Woods, Kracko and Meta Knight), and ultimately to a final showdown at the Fountain of Dreams with King Dedede to win the Cup. Version differences While the core gameplay remains the same, the Japanese and Western versions are drastically different cosmetically. As the story in Super Puyo Puyo is more focused on Arle and Carbuncle's adventures like the Madou Monogatari and Mega Drive Puyo Puyo versions, the Western version replaced them with Kirby characters to appeal to Western audiences. As a game released later in the SNES's life cycle, this game has bright colors and advanced graphics for its time. The sound consists of remixed tracks from Kirby's Adventure and Kirby's Dream Course, with only one original track from the Puyo Puyo game itself (the panic music). As the game boots, a sampled \\"Kirby's Avalanche!\\" or \\"Kirby's Ghost Trap!\\" can be heard. Both versions have cinematics between each round, with differences being Kirby and his opponents shown having full conversations and trash-talking each other in full sentences in the Western version, and that Kirby's personality comes off as a lot more sarcastic and confrontational, just as Arle and Carbuncle were in the Japanese version. This differs greatly from other Kirby games, where Kirby hardly speaks at all and is also friendlier in general. Port In Europe and Australia, the game was re- released on the Wii's Virtual Console service on July 27, 2007, and in North America on September 24, 2007. Reception Kirby's Avalanche received generally positive reviews, garnering an aggregate score of 74% on GameRankings based on seven reviews. IGN awarded the game 7.5 out of 10, comparing it favorably to Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, another Super Puyo Puyo clone released for the Sega Genesis in North America. GamePro commented that \\"Although Kirby's Avalanche is a rehash of an overdone puzzler theme, it's so well done that it's worth playing - that is, if you don't already have three puzzle games just like it.\\" They particularly praised the graphics and the cuteness of the digitized speech. Next Generation stated that \\"While we've seen this kind of game before, and this version doesn't offer any improvements it's still excellent fun.\\" In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked Kirby's Avalanche and Mean Bean Machine collectively as number 84 on their \\"100 Best Games of All Time\\", calling it \\"one of the simplest, most addicting puzzle games around.\\" Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. The intro also mentions that only U.S. releases are covered, hence why Super Puyo Puyo is not listed alongside Kirby's Avalanche and Mean Bean Machine even though the listing mentions its existence.

It is east-northeast of the center of Paris. Meaux is a subprefecture (sous-pr√©fecture) of the Seine-et- Marne department. In France a subprefecture is the chef-lieu (the seat or administrative capital) of an arrondissement: Meaux is the subprefecture of the arrondissement of Meaux.Meaux, as mentioned in the INSEE, the French official statistics institute It is also the chef-lieu of a smaller administrative division: the canton of Meaux. Finally, since its creation in 2003, Meaux has been the centre and the main town of an agglomeration community, the Communaut√© d'agglom√©ration du Pays de Meaux. Demographics With a population of 53,526 inhabitants in 2014, Meaux is the second largest city in the Seine-et-Marne department after Chelles (53,090 inhabitants in 2012).Population of the commune of Chelles: 2012 census (conseil-general.com, official website for all data concerning every French commune) Meaux is, with Provins, Torcy and Fontainebleau, one of the four subprefectures of the department of Seine-et-Marne, Melun being the prefecture. History and culture Inhabitants of Meaux are called Meldois. Both names Meaux and Meldois originated with the Meldi, the Latin name of the original Gaulish tribe who occupied this area of the valley of the Marne river. Although during the Roman period the city was called Iantinum by the Romans,A Meaux, qui s'appelait alors Iantinum in Tabbourt.com, a history specialised website the name of the Meldi persisted and was finally kept for naming both the city and its inhabitants. The episcopal palace (bishop's palace). Behind the palace can be seen the Meaux Cathedral Historical buildings and monuments in Meaux are mainly located in the old city, inside the old defensive walls, still nowadays partially kept thanks to an important segment of the original surrounding wall from the Gallo-Roman period. A meander of the Marne river divides the old city into the North Quarter (called among the Meldois as the Cathedral Quarter) and the South Quarter (known among the locals as the Market Quarter). In the North Quarter there is the Meaux Cathedral, the episcopal palace and its gardens (outlining the shape of a bishop's mitre), the old seat of the chapter (le vieux chapitre), part of the defensive walls (as mentioned), some keeps and towers, and the archaeological remains of the sanctuary of La Bauve, all- embracing the Gaulish period (4th, 3rd and 1st centuries BC), the era of the early Roman Empire (Gallo-Roman: 1st, 2nd and 3rd centuries AD) and the early Christian Era and subsequent centuries (from the 3rd to the 18th centuries, with the remains, among others, of the Saint-Faron Abbey, demolished during the French Revolution). The South Quarter of the old city mainly includes the historic covered market and the Canal Cornillon, built during the Middle Ages, in the year 1235.History and heritage of the rivers and canals of France (in French) Centuries later, in 1806, during the Napoleonic era, was built the Canal de l'Ourcq, destined to the inland navigation when the Marne river is not navigable because of temporary sandbanks. Meaux is nowadays mainly known for Brie de Meaux (a variety of Brie cheese) and the local variety of mustard. Following the official administrative French AOC there are two designations of Brie de Meaux: Brie de Meaux fermier (\\"farm Brie de Meaux\\", made out of the milk from the cows of a single unique producer) and Brie de Meaux laitier (laitier, that is from the French lait, \\"milk\\", which designates here an agreement, a mixture of the milk of different producers). The Moutarde de Meaux (\\"Meaux Mustard\\") recipe is since the 18th century a label commercially owned by the Pommery company and is nowadays derived not only in its traditional well known form but also in a variety of new different ingredient combinations: Honey Mustard, Green Pepper Mustard, Moutarde Royale (that latter including Cognac in its composition) etc. Several festivals and concerts are celebrated in Meaux, venues for live music like the Music Festival \\"Musik'elles\\" (usually at the end of every summer). There's a local public concert band in Meaux: L'Harmonie du Pays de Meaux. It is constituted by three different ensembles, following different ages: Les Minimes (children), Les Juniors (teenagers) and L'Harmonie de Meaux (adults). The band is also one of the two official music academies of the town. The other one is the conservatory of the city. Also, every summer for more than 30 years, during several weekends per summer, a show is played by stage actors in the esplanade situated between the cathedral and the episcopal palace: the Spectacle historique (\\"History show\\"). The show represents the history of Meaux all along the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and also, more recently, during World War I (the German advance had been halted at Meaux in 1914 during the First Battle of the Marne). There is only one cinema in Meaux: The Majestic, a former stage theatre. In modern days there are three stage theatres in the city. One is the Th√©√¢tre G√©rard Philippe, a private theatre, situated close to the covered market.Th√©√¢tre G√©rard Philippe , official website Not far from the market, in the same area but in a bigger and more recent building, there is the official subsidised theatre of the city, the Th√©√¢tre Luxembourg, divided in two separated auditoriums in the same building: the Salle Luxembourg (601 seats) and the Salle du Man√®ge (107 seats).

The besiegers were the English, under Henry V. The town's defence was led by the Bastard of Vaurus, notorious for his savagery. The siege commenced on October 6, 1421, and mining and bombardment soon brought down the walls. Casualties began to mount in the English army, including John Clifford, 7th Baron de Clifford who had been at the siege of Harfleur, the Battle of Agincourt, and received the surrender of Cherbourg. The English also began to fall sick rather early into the siege, and it is estimated that one sixteenth of the besiegers died from dysentery and smallpox. On 9 March 1422, the town surrendered, although the garrison held out. Under continued bombardment, the garrison gave in as well on 10 March, following a siege of six months. The Bastard of Vaurus was decapitated, as was a trumpeter named Orace, who had once mocked King Henry. Sir John Fortescue was then installed as English Captain of Meaux Castle.As the 1638 Fortescue mural monument in Weare Giffard Church, Devon, relates =World War I: First Battle of the Marne= During the First Battle of the Marne (September 1914), the German troops were stopped at the gates of Meaux. This heroic action not only prevented the city from being taken by the Germans but also changed the course of the war. In 1932, at the place of the battlefield, the people of the United States of America had a monument erected in the memory of the French soldiers fallen in action. Called, in French, La Libert√© √©plor√©e (\\"The Tearful Liberty\\"), the sculpture by Frederick MacMonnies is popularly known among the French as Le Monument am√©ricain (\\"the American monument\\").

As a member of the Australian team in women's 4√ó100-metre medley relay, she won an Olympic gold medal and broke a world record at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Rooney is currently an Australian television presenter. Personal life Rooney was born in Brisbane, attended Miami State Primary School and All Saints Anglican School on the Gold Coast. Giaan is married to Sam Levett. On 17 March 2014, Rooney gave birth to her first child, a boy, and on 14 June 2017 a girl. Swimming career Rooney's career began at age 11 at the Miami club in Queensland, where she was coached by Denis Cotterell. Training partners there included Grant Hackett and Daniel Kowalski. In 2002 Rooney moved to Melbourne, coached by Ian Pope at the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre. Training partners included Matt Welsh, Michael Klim (who was also her boyfriend for two years) and Brett Hawke. Rooney made her international swimming debut for Australia at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, where she won a gold medal in the 100 m backstroke as a 15-year-old. Rooney was also part of Australia's gold-medal winning 4√ó100-metre medley relay team at the 1998 Games. At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney Rooney won two silver medals as a part of the 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay (with Kirsten Thomson, Susie O'Neill and Petria Thomas) and 4√ó100-metre medley relay (swam in morning preliminary session). Rooney at the 2011 Australian Grand Prix In 2001 Rooney claimed the world champion title in the 200 m freestyle, winning at the 2001 Fukuoka World Swimming Championships in Japan. This meet was also widely remembered for the disqualification of the Australian women's team after they jumped in the water to celebrate apparent victory in the 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay: the team of Elka Graham, Petria Thomas and Linda Mackenzie joined anchor swimmer Rooney in the water to celebrate their win, but as it was before all other competitors had finished the event, they were disqualified.

She won a silver medal behind teammate Sophie Edington in the 100-metre backstroke, and qualified fastest for the 50-metre backstroke. However, she was upset by Edington by 0.01 of a second, again winning a silver medal.

It was founded in 1980, and promoted the separation from Canada of all provinces and territories west of Ontario. The WCC attained its greatest notoriety in Alberta, where it succeeded in electing an MLA to the provincial legislature in 1982. It was also active in the other western provinces, however, and ran provincial candidates in Manitoba in a 1984 by-election and the 1986 general election. Its Manitoba leader was Fred Cameron. In 1984, Cameron stood for a by-election in the Winnipeg riding of Fort Garry, and received 186 votes. In the following general election, he stood against Gary Doer in Concordia and received 204 votes. There were five WCC candidates in this election, the minimum required for official ballot status. Their combined vote total was 672. In 1987, a number of disgruntled WCC members in Alberta formed the new Western Independence Party. Cameron joined this new organization, and appears to have taken most of Manitoba's WCC membership with him. It is unclear if the party simply changed its name, or if the Manitoba WIP was formed by secessionists from the WCC. In any event, the Manitoba WCC does not appear to have existed past 1987.

The population of the region was 1,123,307 in 2016; however, this number does not include large numbers of seasonal cottage country residents, which at peak times of the year swell its population to well in excess of 1.5 million. Although it contains many small and medium-sized urban centres, much of Central Ontario is covered by farms, lakes (with freshwater beaches), rivers or sparsely populated forested land on the southern edge of the Canadian Shield. Definitions Central Ontario is located within the primary region of Southern Ontario, which places it geographically in the south- central part of the province. Although most of the census divisions (which in Ontario take the form of counties, regional and district municipalities, territorial districts, and some cities) in the south-central tier of the province are commonly grouped as a distinct secondary provincial region, nearly all of them have affiliations or orientations towards other primary or secondary provincial regions to the north, south, and east. The Parry Sound territorial or judicial district and Muskoka district municipality are geographically within Central Ontario but are administrated as part of the primary region of Northern Ontario by federal economic development programs because of these districts' special economic circumstances. Parry Sound, but not Muskoka, is also classed administratively with an extended primary Northern Ontario region by the provincial government for reasons similar to those at the federal level. The southern part of the territorial or judicial district of Nipissing lies in Central Ontario which extends geographically as far north as the Mattawa River. However like Muskoka and Parry Sound, all of Nipissing is treated administratively as part of Northern Ontario. All or part of Dufferin, Grey, and Bruce counties may on occasion be included with Central Ontario as they are near or north of 44 degrees latitude, but are far more often treated as part of the secondary region of Southwestern Ontario (particularly its Midwestern Ontario subset) or the Georgian Triangle area, which includes parts of both Central and Southwestern Ontario. Further east at about the same latitude, Simcoe, Peterborough, and Northumberland counties and the City of Kawartha Lakes also have a southward orientation as part of the Greater Golden Horseshoe region centered around the west end of Lake Ontario. Even further east, Hastings County and Prince Edward County may be considered part of Central Ontario by different sources but are more often included with the secondary region of Eastern Ontario, mostly because they share the same telephone area codes (613 and 343), have better transportation links to this region, and are part of the coverage area of Kingston-area media. This leaves Haliburton County as the only census division in Central Ontario that has no affiliations with any other secondary provincial regions of Ontario. Geography Lake Simcoe The Canadian Shield runs over the northern part of Central Ontario, a recreational area with a much-increased summer-time population, including the wilderness of Algonquin Provincial Park. Often referred to as 'Cottage Country', this area's lakes and rivers are dotted with numerous cottages, some of them seasonal, but in recent years there is a growing trend for some of these 'summer cottages' to be used as year-round residences due to a number of factors, abundance of outdoor recreation, baby- boom retiree population, increased local services and improved wireless communication. The Trent-Severn Waterway, constructed over many years in the mid-19th century, spans Central Ontario via a series of boat locks, connecting Georgian Bay with Lake Ontario, entering the bay at Port Severn and Lake Ontario at the Trent River on the Bay of Quinte at Trenton (access to Lake Ontario also can be had by using the Murray Canal). Bypassing many rapids, this waterway is used by pleasure boaters and anglers during the summer months. Along the northern edge of Central Ontario, are some of the highest elevations in Southern Ontario. These highlands are known as the Opeongo Hills, and they stretch into portions of Eastern Ontario as well. Climate The climate of this area is a humid continental climate with large seasonal variation moderated somewhat by the Great Lakes. Summers are warm and humid (sometimes hot) but are shorter than further south with generally cooler nights. Winters are cold with significant snowfalls; some snowbelt areas receive an average of over 300 cm (120 in.) per year. Severe summer storms are also commonplace, particularly in Simcoe County which for Ontario has a high tornado prevalence and was the site of the infamous Barrie Tornado in 1985.

It was formed in 1987 by Fred Cameron, formerly the leader of the province's Western Canada Concept. It is unclear if the Manitoba WIP was simply a renamed WCC or an entirely new organization. The Manitoba WCC seems to have disappeared soon after the WIP's founding. Like the WCC, the WIP promoted independence and nationhood for Canada's four western provinces (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia). The Manitoba branch of the party participated in the province's 1988 and 1990 elections, with Cameron as its leader. The WIP ran 16 candidates in the 1988 election, considerably more than the five run by the WCC in the 1986 election. Cameron ran against Gary Doer in the north Winnipeg riding of Concordia, and received 114 votes. No WIP candidate came close to being elected. The WIP ran six candidates in the 1990 election. Cameron again ran against Doer, this time receiving 168 votes. Once again, no WIP candidate came close to being elected. The party was still registered with Elections Manitoba in the 1995 election, but did not run any candidates. In 2003, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation report on the Saskatchewan WIP made reference to the Manitoba party's continued existence. It has not participated in any elections since 1990, however.

Acclaimed in his lifetime as a hypnotist, mentalist, occultist, and astrologer, Hanussen was active in Weimar Republic Germany and also at the beginning of Nazi Germany. He is said to have instructed Adolf Hitler in performance and the achievement of dramatic effect. Early years Although Hanussen claimed to be a Danish aristocrat, he was in fact a Moravian Jew, born as Hermann (Herschel Chaim) Steinschneider.Gordon, Mel: \\"Hanussen: Hitler's Jewish Clairvoyant\\". Feral House, 2001, p. 249. Hanussen's father, Siegfried Steinschneider (1858-1910), was an actor and caretaker of a synagogue who married Antonie Julie Kohn, a singer, in Vienna, Austria. Hanussen's parents traveled constantly through Austria and Italy with acting and musical troupes, taking Hanussen with them.\\"Magida, p. 18. Career After World War I, Hanussen performed a mind reading and hypnosis act at La Scala in Berlin that catapulted him to stardom. At his height, he enjoyed the company of Germany's military and business elite, also becoming close with members of the SA. It is claimed he was a supporter of the Nazis despite his Jewish ancestry, which was an open secret. Stories abound of meetings between Hanussen and Hitler, including an encounter shortly before the election of November 1932, during which Hanussen taught Hitler his crowd control techniques of using gestures and dramatic pauses.See generally John Toland, Adolf Hitler, p. 218, Anchor Books edition (1992), originally published by Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc. (1976). Hanussen was also quite close to other important Nazi officials, to whom he had often lent money, including Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf, Karl Ernst and Friedrich Wilhelm Ohst. Dr. Walter C. Langer, a psychoanalyst, prepared a psychological profile of Hitler for the Office of Strategic Services in 1943. The profile included a reference to Hanussen: \\"... during the early 1920s Hitler took regular lessons in speaking and in mass psychology from a man named [Hanussen]The name in the quote is \\"Hamissen.\\" This is apparently a typographical error, since in the same sentence the name is subsequently spelled correctly two times as Hanussen. In the 1972 reprint of the document by New American Library, the name \\"Hanussen\\" is spelled correctly. See Walter C. Langer, The Mind of Adolf Hitler: The Secret Wartime Report, p. 40, New American Library (1972). who was also a practicing astrologer and fortune-teller. He was an extremely clever individual who taught Hitler a great deal concerning the importance of staging meetings to obtain the greatest dramatic effect.\\"A Psychological Profile of Adolph Hitler ; see also Walter C. Langer, The Mind of Adolf Hitler: The Secret Wartime Report, p. 40, New American Library (1972). In 1931 Hanussen purchased a Breslau printing firm and began publishing an occult journal, Hanussen Magazin and Bunte Wochenschau, a popular biweekly Berlin tabloid which included astrological columns.Gordon, Mel: \\"Hitler's Jewish Psychic\\". \\"Guilt & Pleasure\\" (3). Roger Bennett, Summer 2006 He used the proceeds from his publishing ventures and stage shows to purchase a mansion which became known as \\"The Palace of the Occult\\", which he renovated and turned into a luxurious interactive theatre for fortune telling games. Guests would sit around a large circular table and place their palms on glass with symbols lit from beneath; the room lights would be lowered in a s√©ance-like fashion; and various gimmicks would highlight Hanussen's dramatic verbal presentation of prophecies to the guests. He predicted events in the lives of the individuals present, but controversy arose when he predicted the future of Germany. He became successful, was always in demand in various venues, and had a full-time valet. Alfred Neubauer, a famous motor racing team manager, refers to Hanussen in his autobiography, Speed Was My Life (first published in English in 1960). In the chapter 'A Prophecy Comes True', he describes a prediction made by Hanussen before the race at AVUS in Germany in May 1932. While at the Roxy Bar with other drivers, Neubauer challenged Hanussen to predict the winner of the following day's race. After some 'leg pulling', Hanussen wrote two names on a piece of paper, which he folded, and put in an envelope. This was placed in the custody of the barman. He had strict instructions that it be left unopened until after the race. Hanussen announced, 'One of us at this table will win tomorrow, another will die. The two names are in this envelope.' During the race, driver Prince Lobkowicz was killed, and Brauchitsch won. After the race, Neubauer states he opened the envelope and found those names inside. Several days later, a Berlin newspaper reported that Hanussen had urged the German Automobile Club to persuade Prince Lobkowicz not to take part in the race, but Club officials had taken no action. =Reichstag fire and assassination= Predicting the Reichstag fire, a decisive event that allowed recently appointed Chancellor of Germany Adolf Hitler to seize absolute power in 1933, was Hanussen's most famous feat of clairvoyance. It also was possibly a miscalculated use of inside information that led to his death shortly thereafter.Kurlander, p. 105. Hanussen was assassinated on March 25, 1933,Gordon, Mel: Hanussen: Hitler's Jewish Clairvoyant Feral House, 2001, p. 249. . probably by a group of SA men,Kurlander, p. 101. and was hastily buried in a field on the outskirts of Berlin, near Stahnsdorf.John Toland, Adolf Hitler, p. 962, Anchor Books edition (1992), originally published by Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc. (1976). He was potential competition to Hermann G√∂ring and Joseph Goebbels for the attention of their F√ºhrer, which may also have led to his murder. Hanussen's body was discovered over a month later. There are unsubstantiated claims that he may have been involved in the Reichstag fire, hypnotizing and directing Marinus van der Lubbe, the convicted arsonist, to commit the act.Gordon, Mel: \\"Hanussen: Hitler's Jewish Clairvoyant\\". Feral House, 2001, p. 242 Erik Jan Hanussen is buried in the S√ºdwestkirchhof, Stahnsdorf, near Berlin.Magida, pp. 215-217. Personal life Hanussen's daughter, Erika Fuchs Steinschneider, was born to his first wife Theresia Luksch in 1920.Steinschneider, Phil: Steinschneider Genealogy. Accessed 2008-02-13 After their separation, Theresia resettled with her young daughter in Merano, Italy where Theresia eventually met, married, and later divorced Mr. Fuchs, heir to a brewing company. Hanussen was possibly survived by a son born in 1922 to a mistress. The son, Gerhard Belgardt, was placed in an orphanage and survived the war. He later gained some fame by performing as a clairvoyant, calling himself Hanussen II.

Early life At the age of 13, Petitclerc lost the use of both legs in an accident when at a friend's farm, a heavy barn door fell on her, fracturing her spine at the L1-T12 vertebra. Gaston Jacques, a high school physical education teacher, was to have a decisive influence on her life when he taught her to swim for four lunch hours a week throughout high school as she was unable to participate in the gym course. In a 2011 interview, she stated that, \\"[swimming] really helped me get more fit and stronger, and helped me live a more independent life in a wheelchair.\\" Swimming also allowed her to discover her competitive drive. While she had previously been first in her class academically, it was her introduction to the world of competitive racing. Sport When she was eighteen, Pierre Pomerleau, a trainer at Universit√© Laval in Quebec City, introduced her to wheelchair sports. Using a homemade wheelchair, she took part in her first race and came last, well behind the other competitors. However, she had fallen in love with wheelchair racing and a long and fruitful career had begun. While Petitclerc was developing her skills as a wheelchair athlete, she pursued her studies, first in social sciences at the CEGEP de Sainte-Foy and then in history at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, where she registered in order to be able to train with Peter Eriksson, who remains her coach to this day. Petitclerc competed in the Paralympic Games for the first time in Barcelona in 1992, returning with two bronze medals, the start of collection that now includes twenty one Paralympic medals, fourteen of them gold. Four years later, at the Atlanta games, she took gold medals in the 100 and 200 m events and three silvers in the 400, 800, and 1500 m races. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, she won two golds, in the 200 m and 800 m, and two silvers, in the 100 m and 400 m races. She won three gold medals (in 100 m, 200 m, and 400 m) and a bronze (800 m) at the 2002 World Championships and a gold at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in the 800 m. At the 2004 Summer Olympics (where wheelchair racing was an exhibition sport) she won the 800 m, and went on to an impressive showing with 5 gold medals at the 2004 Summer Paralympics. When she returned from Athens in 2004, Petitclerc told reporters the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing would be her last big international meeting but that she will continue training and road racing for a while. For her performance in 2008, she was awarded the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canadian athlete of the year and the Canadian Press's Bobbie Rosenfeld Award as Canada's female athlete of the year. Petitclerc was also awarded the Best Female award at the Paralympic Sport Awards. With her 5 golds in the 2004 Paralympics, she tied the existing Canadian gold medal record at a single Games, Winter or Summer, set by Stephanie Dixon at the 2000 Summer Paralympics. Her 5 golds in the 2008 Paralympics tied that record. As of 2010, the record still stood.Vancouver Sun, \\"Woolstencroft wins fifth gold medal\\" , CanWest News Service, 21 March 2010 (accessed 21 March 2010) As of 2012 she holds five world records for wheelchair racing. As of 2019 she is still the most gold-medalled female paralympic athlete with 14 golds and 21 medals. She was chosen as the flagbearer of the Canadian team at the opening ceremonies of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Petitclerc lives in Montreal, and trains at Complexe sportif Claude-Robillard. Rio Tinto Alcan is her main sponsor since 1998. Petitclerc was appointed as a coach and mentor to the British athletics team ahead of the 2012 Summer Paralympics, working alongside her former coach and UK Athletics' Paralympic head coach Peter Eriksson. Petitclerc was named the Chef de Mission for Canada's 2014 Commonwealth Games team. She was also named Chef de Mission for the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Personal life Petitclerc is married to electro-acoustic music composer James Duhamel and gave birth to son Elliot in December 2013. Senate On March 18, 2016, Petitclerc was named to the Senate of Canada on the advice of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. She sits as an Independent senator, part of the Independent Senators Group. Her main priorities in the Senate are health as well as the rights of persons with disabilities. In June 2016, Senator Petitclerc delivered her first speech in the Chamber on Bill C-14, An Act to amend the Criminal Code and to make related amendments to other Acts (medical assistance in dying). Her speech moved many of her colleagues, when she quoted: \\"When you have a disability, the worst part is feeling as if you have no control over your own life, over your own body. It happens to all people with disabilities, I can assure you.\\" She also sponsored Bill S-5, An Act to amend the Tobacco Act and the Non Smokers' Health Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts. Honours and awards The St-Marc- des-Carri√®res municipal ice hockey arena now bears her name. In 2002, Petitclerc was awarded with the Meritorious Service Medal (civil division). In 2005, Petitclerc was invested as a Knight of the Order of Quebec On June 16, 2009, it was announced that Petitclerc would receive a star on Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto. The induction ceremony was held on September 12, 2009. In 2009, she was invested as a Companion of the Order of Canada \\"for her achievements as a Paralympic champion known internationally as an inspiration, and for her commitment to developing sports for athletes with a disability\\".

Life He was the eldest son of Duke Bretislav I (d. 1055) and his consort Judith of Schweinfurt. While his father entered into conflict with the Salian king Henry III, young Spytihnƒõv from 1039 onwards spent several years as a hostage at the German court. When he succeeded his father as duke, his coronation was celebrated with the first known rendition of Hospodine pomiluj ny, the earliest known song in the Czech language. After his accession to the throne, he went at once to Regensburg to receive imperial confirmation. According to the contemporary chronicler Cosmas of Prague, this loyalty to the Holy Roman Empire did not prevent him from expelling all Germans from his lands, including his mother Judith, and the new anti-German policy continued to his death. In 1056, Spytihnƒõv had all the monks driven out of Sazava Abbey, yet despite this, Pope Nicholas II sought the alliance of the Bohemian duke in 1059. Thus, Rome granted Spytihnƒõv the right to wear the mitre and tunic of a bishop for the annual sum of 100 marks. His brothers having inherited Moravia, Spytihnƒõv tried to reduce their authority by arresting 300 Moravian magnates and stripping his brothers of their rights in the province. Thus, Vratislaus of Olomouc fled to Hungary in 1058. Spytihnƒõv was succeeded by Vratislaus, who in turn entrusted Moravia to his brother Conrad. Marriage About 1054 Spytihnƒõv was married to Ida of Wettin (Hidda), a daughter of Margrave Theodoric II of Lusatia. They had: *Svatobor (Friedrich), Patriarch of Aquileia in 1084.

Design and development The previous project of a four-seater STOL experimental aircraft under the designation Pilatus SB-1 was not implemented, followed by the SB-2, which was intended for commercial use.Pilatus SB-2 Pelican: Das Schweizer Bergflugzeug 1938‚Äì1949. Studienb√ºro f√ºr Spezialflugzeuge, Kuno Gross, . Work on the SB-2 Pelican, a special ‚Äúslow- flying‚Äù aircraft, commenced in the winter of 1941. Good short takeoff and landing credentials, plus steep climbing capabilities, were essential attributes of the aircraft flown in the narrow Alpine valleys at that time. The aircraft was designed to carry four to six passengers. The configuration of the SB-2 was slightly unusual, in that it was provided with tricycle undercarriage (an uncommon feature at the time), and a wing that had a slight forward sweep. The Pilatus SB-2 also served as the basis for a slightly larger STOL aircraft with a larger cargo and passenger capacity, the Pilatus SB-5. However, the Pilatus SB-5 was never built.Pilatus SB-2 Pelican: Das Schweizer Bergflugzeug 1938‚Äì1949. Studienb√ºro f√ºr Spezialflugzeuge, Kuno Gross, . Operational history The SB-2 made its maiden flight on 30 May 1944. After extensive trials, the only model built went to Alpar AG in Bern. The Pelikan was particularly well suited for passenger operations, but could also be used for aerial photography, survey flights, freight transport and agricultural work. During an air display on 13 June 1948, the Pelican flipped over because the nosewheel sheared off from an unnoticed transverse fracture. It was damaged beyond repair.

It is also popular in Argentina and Brazil, brought in by Italian immigrants, mostly in the Scopa di Quindici variation. Scopa is also played in former Italian colonies such as Libya and Somalia or some other countries like Tunisia with changed appearance in the cards. It is played with a standard Italian 40-card deck, mostly between two players or four in two partnerships, but it can also be played by 3 or 6 players. The name is an Italian noun meaning \\"broom\\", since taking a scopa means \\"to sweep\\" all the cards from the table. Watching a game of scopa can be a highly entertaining activity, since games traditionally involve lively, colorful, and somewhat strong-worded banter in between hands. However, skill and chance are more important for the outcome of the game.  History  Scopa was already widespread throughout Italy in the 18th century, but there is no earlier evidence of its origin. Cards \\"Napoletane\\" cards A deck of Italian cards consist of 40 cards, divided into four suits. Neapolitan, Piacentine, Triestine, and Sicilian cards are divided into Coppe (Cups), Ori or Denari (Golds or Coins), Spade (Swords) and Bastoni (Clubs), while Piemontesi, Milanesi and Toscane cards use the 'French' suits, that is Cuori (Hearts), Quadri (Diamonds, literally \\"Squares\\"), Fiori (Flowers) and Picche (Spades, literally \\"Pikes\\"). The values on the cards range numerically from one through seven, plus three face cards in each suit: Knave [Fante in Italian] (worth a value of 8), Knight [Cavallo in Italian] in the Neapolitan- type decks, Queen [Donna in Italian] in the Milanese-type decks (worth 9), and King [Re in Italian] (worth 10). A Knave is a lone male figure standing. The Knight is a male figure riding a horse; the Queen is a female figure. The King is a male figure wearing a crown. To determine the face value of any numeric card, simply count the number of suit icons on the card. Since the Coins/Diamonds are important in winning some points, the cards of that suit are also nicknamed as \\"bello\\" (handsome): so, \\"il settebello\\" is the Seven of Coins/Diamonds, \\"l'asso bello\\" is the Ace of Coins/Diamonds. Gameplay All players arrange themselves around the playing surface. If playing in teams, team members should be opposite each other. One player is chosen to be the dealer. Initial setting of the game Each player receives three cards. The dealer deals them out one card at a time, in a counter-clockwise direction, beginning with the player to their right. During this deal, the dealer will also place four cards face up on the table. A table card may be dealt before the deal begins, immediately after dealing a card to themselves but before dealing to the next player, or after dealing all players all three cards. As it is impossible to sweep in a game where the initial table cards include three or four kings, such a deal is considered invalid. The cards are re- shuffled, and the dealer deals again. The player to the dealer's right begins play. This player has two options: Either place a card on the table, or play a card to capture one or more cards. A capture is made by matching a card in the player's hand to a card of the same value on the table, or if that is not possible, by matching a card in the player's hand to the sum of the values of two or more cards on the table. In both cases, both the card from the player's hand and the captured card(s) are removed and placed face down in a pile in front of the player. These cards are now out of play until scores are calculated at the end of the round. If by capturing, all cards were removed from the table, then this is called a scopa, and an additional point is awarded at the end of the round. Opponent is capturing two cards with one card from his hand (1+3=4). :Example: The player's hand contains the 2 of coins, 5 of swords, and 7 of clubs (or batons). On the table are the ace of coins, 5 of cups, and 6 of swords. The player's options are: #Place the 2 of coins on the table; #Capture the 5 of cups using the 5 of swords, and place both cards face down in front of themselves; #Capture the 6 of swords and ace of coins using the 7 of clubs, and place all three cards face down in front of themselves. Note that it is not legal to place on the table a card that has the ability to capture. For example, if a 2 and a 4 are on the table and a player holds a 6, the player must either take that trick or play a different card from their hand. In any circumstance in which a played card may capture either a single or multiple cards, the player is forced to capture only the single card. For example, if the cards on the table are 1, 3, 4, and 8 (Knave, or Fante in Italian), and the player plays another Knave, the player is not allowed to capture the 1, 3, and 4, even though their total does add up to 8. Instead, the player is only allowed to capture the Knave. After all players have played all three cards, the dealer deals out three more cards to each player, again beginning with the player to their right. That player then begins play again. No additional cards are dealt to the table. This process is repeated until no cards remain in the deck. After the dealer has played the final card of the final hand of the round, the player who most recently captured is awarded any remaining cards on the table, and points are calculated for each player or team. If no team has yet won the game, the deal moves to the right. The new dealer shuffles and deals the cards as described above. Scoring Points are awarded at the completion of each deal. If playing in teams, the team members combine their captured cards before counting to calculate points. Players get one point for each \\"scopa\\". In addition, there are up to four points available for the following, each worth 1 point apiece: * captured the greatest number of cards. * captured the greatest number of cards in the suit of coins. * captured the seven of coins (\\"sette bello\\"). * obtained the highest \\"prime\\" (literally, primiera), erroneously referred to as simply \\"capturing the majority of sevens\\". If two or more teams or players capture the same number of cards, same number of coin cards, or the same prime value, no point is awarded for that result, e.g. if both Team 1 and Team 2 capture 20 cards total, neither gets a point for the most cards. The \\"prime\\" for each team is determined by selecting the team's \\"best\\" card in each of the four suits, and totaling those four cards' point values. When calculating the prime, a separate point scale is used. The player with the highest number of points using this separate point scale gets one point toward the game score. The most common version of the separate scale is: * Seven (sette) = 21 points * Six (sei) = 18 points * Ace (asso) = 16 points * Five (cinque) = 15 points * Four (quattro) = 14 points * Three (tre) = 13 points * Two (due) = 12 points * Face cards = 10 points If one team captures the sevens of cups and coins, the six of clubs and the ace of swords, that team's prime is (21 + 21 + 18 + 16) = 76. Other versions of the prime's point scale exist. Most use the same ranking of cards but have variant scores, e.g. 0 points for face cards instead of 10. A variant that is popular in America but disliked by purists is to award the prime to the person with the most sevens, or the person with the most sixes if there is a tie, down to aces, and so on. Obviously, the seven of coins is the most valuable card in the deck, as it alone contributes to all the four points. A player or team can win the \\"prime\\" even with only one seven but other useful cards. If one player has three sevens (3x21) and no cards of the fourth suit (sum=63), their opponent can win the \\"prime\\" with one seven (21) and three aces (3x16), for their sum would be 69. Therefore, it is a common tactic, while playing the game, to capture aces and sixes whenever possible. Likewise, if a player is holding a six and there are an ace, a two, a four, and a five on the table, they should choose the five plus the ace, unless they have already taken the seven or the six of the suit of the ace and unless one of the two remaining cards is of the coins suit and they haven't made the point of coins yet. In addition to the four standard points (called \\"punti di mazzo\\", literally \\"deck's points\\"), teams are awarded additional points for every \\"scopa\\" they took during game play. A scopa is awarded when a team manages to sweep the table of all cards. That is, if the table contains only a 2 and a 4, and player A plays a 6, player A is awarded a scopa. Clearing the table on the last play of the last hand of a round does not count as a scopa. The game is played until one team has at least 11 points and has a greater total than any other team. No points, including scopa points, are awarded mid- round; they are all calculated upon completion of the round. For that reason, if the current score is 10 to 9, and the team with 10 points captures the seven of coins or a scopa, the team cannot immediately claim victory. It is still possible that the opposing team could end up with a tied or higher score once all points are calculated. In some Italian cities before the game the players can agree to play with the \\"cappotto\\" variant, in that scenario if a player is winning 7 points to 0, the game can be considered over and the player does not have to reach the total of 11 points. It is also possible to agree on a different score, usually with increments of five or ten, e.g., 16, 21 or 31 points. Idioms Traditionally, one card from a sweep is turned face up in the captured cards, to remind players while calculating points that a scopa was won, and to taunt them. Many players deal the initial table cards in a 2x2 square. Alternative variations There are many variations of scopa. Since there are no formal rules, it is good manners to agree with the other players on the rules that are to be used before starting a game. Many of the variations here can be combined. For example, a common variant in the Milan area combines \\"Scopone scientifico\\", \\"Scopa d'Assi\\" and \\"Napola\\". =Playing with French-suited cards= When playing with a standard 52-card pack with French suits, 12 cards need to be removed from the deck. Easiest for most new players is to remove the face cards, and therefore play with cards ranging numerically from one through ten. More traditional is to remove the eights, nines, and tens from the deck, which yields the 40-card \\"Milanese\\" deck. With the Milanese deck the Jack is 8, the Queen is 9, and the King is 10 (note that in some Neapolitan decks, the Jack is called \\"Lady\\" and is worth 8). Regardless of which cards are removed, the diamonds suit is used for the Italian coin suit, making capturing the most diamonds and the seven of diamonds each worth a point. =Scopa d'Assi (Asso piglia tutto)= In this variation of the game, playing an Ace captures all cards currently on the table (and does not count as a scopa). Depending on other chosen variants, it can happen that an ace is already on the table when one draws an ace. Rules vary as to whether or not the player will take all the cards, but usually the player takes only the ace already on the table. This event, that every player will try to avoid, is called burning an ace. =Scopone= The game of Scopone is based on Scopa. In this game, which must be played in 2 teams of 2, players are dealt all nine of their cards at the start of each round. Play proceeds around the table until all players have played all of their cards. In another form of the game, the scopone scientifico, the players are dealt ten cards each so that none is left. Scopa d'Assi is mostly played in the latter variant. =Napola= In this variation (also known as Scopone trentino), a team capturing the ace, two, and three of coins achieves the Napola (aka Napula) and is awarded additional points equal to the highest consecutive coin they obtain, e.g. if a team captures the ace, two, three, four, and five, and eight of coins, that team is awarded 5 additional points. Because of the higher number of points awarded per game, the game is played until one team has 21 points, rather than 11. Sometimes a team that manages to capture all 10 coins in a single round wins the game immediately. =Additional points= In the Re Bello (\\"Beautiful King\\") version, the King of coins also counts as a point, just as does the Seven of coins. In some regions of Calabria (especially near Cosenza), a point is awarded for the seven of cups in addition to the seven of coins. =Scopa di Quindici= In this variation, the played card does not take a card or set of cards that sum to the value of the card played. Rather, it takes any set of cards including itself that add to 15. If the table is A, 3, 5, 7, playing a 2 would take itself plus the A, 5 and 7 (A + 2 + 5 + 7 = 15). =Cirulla= This Genoese variation is highly popular in Liguria and bordering zones; it is basically a mixture of traditional scopa, \\"Scopa di quindici\\" and \\"Scopa d'assi\\", plus it awards additional points for the \\"Grande\\" (Big One - 5 points go to the player able to take all three figure cards of coins), \\"Piccola\\" (Small Ones - 1 point awarded for each consecutive card of coins after the ace. It is entirely possible for a player to get the \\"most coins\\" point but neither the Big One nor Small One bonus due to the opponent securing vital cards in the sequence). Moreover, Cirulla players whose hand of three cards adds up to less than 9 have to put all of them down on the table and mark three points as if he scored that many \\"scopa\\". To the end of such calculations the seven of cups (hearts in Genoese-types) counts as \\"matta\\" (\\"joker\\"): the player decides its value. With such a high degree of point-awarding combinations and the possibility of scoring dozens of points in a single hand Cirulla games are tense affairs, where seemingly desperate situations can be reversed in a matter of minutes and where the ultimate goal can be set at 51 points. =Libyan Scopa= Scopa is very popular in Libya and is usually played as mentioned above, but some local variations are often added: for example, a) a sweep of Diamonds (sometimes eight are enough) will reset the opponent to zero, b) players count Scopas based on the value of the winning card (if the 'winning card' is worth 7, the scopa is worth 7), and c) players count Scopa values based on the total number of cards involved (if a scopa numbers 5 cards, the number of points awarded for that scopa equals 5; if a scopa is but 2 cards, only 2 points are awarded). =Scoring the prime= A number of variant point systems are used for calculating the prime, most of which produce the same order of hands. One notable variant that does not produce the same order is to count 0 points for each face card. =Final score= Some play to 16 or 21 points, or even to an arbitrary score agreed to at the beginning of the game. =Tunisian Shkobba= Brought by Italian and Sicilian immigrants, the game is known in Tunisia as Shkobba and is played with decks similar in appearance to Sicilian cards. Shkobba is played with the same rules, the same score but played main with two players, or two duos. Shkobba is popular in Tunisia, especially during Ramadan. Computer versions There is a playable version of Scopa within the Nancy Drew game The Phantom of Venice. There are apps for Android smartphones, and the Nokia internet tablet running the Maemo operating system, as well as for iOS iPads and iPhones.

It was later collected in The Stories of John Cheever. In 1968, \\"The Swimmer\\" was adapted into a film of the same name, starring Burt Lancaster. Plot The story begins with Neddy Merrill lounging at a friend's pool on a warm midsummer day. On a whim, Neddy decides to return home by swimming through all the pools in the neighborhood, which he names \\"the Lucinda River\\" to honor his wife. He begins the journey enthusiastic and full of youthful energy and, in the early stops on his journey, his friends enthusiastically greet him with drinks; it is readily apparent that he is well-regarded, and has an upper or upper-middle-class social standing. As his journey progresses, the story's tone gradually becomes darker and more surreal. Despite the ever-present afternoon light, it becomes unclear how much time has passed: at the beginning of the story it is clearly midsummer, but eventually all natural signs point to the season being autumn. Some old acquaintances Neddy encounters mention his financial problems, although he does not remember having such misfortunes. He is patently unwelcome at several houses belonging to owners of a lower social class. His earlier, youthful energy gradually declines, and it becomes increasingly painful and difficult for him to swim on. Finally, he staggers back home only to find his house decrepit, empty, and abandoned. Background Originally conceived as a novel and pared down from over 150 pages of notes, some scholars believe it is Cheever's most famous and frequently anthologized story. As published, the story is highly praised for its blend of realism and surrealism, the thematic exploration of suburban America, especially the relationship between wealth and happiness, as well as his use of myth and symbolism.  Differences between the film plot and original story  Although the story and the film share many commonalities, the differences lie in making a short story long enough to suit a feature-length film which does not change the basic elements of the story's plot. The first change is that Neddy is mostly referred to as Ned, with just a few pleasantly surprised neighbours briefly using Neddy. Shirley Adams, Neddy's previous mistress, also undergoes a name change. She is no longer simply described as being beautiful but is changed into an actress named Shirley Abbott. Shirley is given an opportunity to share her experience with being Ned's mistress, while the story version of Shirley speaks only briefly before Neddy swims in her pool. Several minor characters in the film are completely absent in the short story: Julie, the Merrill daughters' old babysitter; Kevin, a boy who Ned helps conquer his fears of swimming; and Joan, an eager young woman whose friends dissuade her from joining Ned on his adventure. The film also hints at Ned's dark past much earlier in the narrative than the story by allowing the Westerhazys to appear concerned as Ned leaves their pool. In contrast, Neddy is well into his adventure before the text hints at his forgotten past. Alcohol appears repeatedly in both the book and the film as well as Ned's inability to remember painful events from the past. The final scene in both the story and the film are the same: Ned returns to his deserted home and is unable to enter.

The band performed live mainly in the New England area, with acrimony between the brothers steadily building up, until a definitive falling out between Tommy and Jimmy over the tempo of \\"I'll Never Say Never Again Again\\" in May 1935, after which Tommy walked off the stage. Glenn Miller composed four songs for the Dorsey Brothers when he was a member in 1934 and 1935, \\"Annie's Cousin Fannie\\", on which both Tommy and Glenn share the rather racy vocal, \\"Dese Dem Dose\\", \\"Harlem Chapel Chimes\\", and \\"Tomorrow's Another Day\\".. Miller left in late 1934 to take up the job as Ray Noble's musical director and arranger. In 1935, the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra had two No. 1 recordings on Decca, including \\"Lullaby of Broadway\\" with Bob Crosby on vocals, topping the charts for two weeks and No. 1 for three weeks. Tommy Dorsey permanently left the orchestra in 1935 to take over the Joe Haymes band, turning it into Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra, with the nucleus of the Dorsey Brothers' Orchestra carrying on under Jimmy's leadership. Tommy's chair was filled by the 16-year-old Bobby Byrne. The Dorseys reunited on March 15, 1945 to record a V-Disc at Liederkranz Hall in New York City. Released in June 1945, the disc contained \\"More Than You Know\\" and \\"Brotherly Jump\\". The songs were performed by the combined orchestras of Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey. They reunited again in 1947 for the film The Fabulous Dorseys. In 1950, Jimmy disbanded his orchestra and joined Tommy's band on a permanent basis. On May 23, 1953, the combined orchestra made its television debut on the Jackie Gleason Show. Starting in 1954, they had a network TV series, Stage Show produced by Jackie Gleason. Elvis Presley made his national television debut on their show in 1956. Charlie Parker, who as a fledgling alto sax player expressed an admiration for Jimmy, died in front of the TV while watching a Dorsey Brothers' show. When in November 1956 Tommy died in his sleep from choking on his own vomit, Jimmy, already desperately ill, carried on for some months with Tommy's silent trombone displayed on stage, until in June 1957 he succumbed to lung cancer. Jimmy and Tommy appeared as the Mystery Guests on the October 16, 1955 airing of What's My Line?. They were guessed by Dorothy Kilgallen. In 1996, the U.S. Postal Service issued a commemorative postage stamp in honor of Jimmy Dorsey and Tommy Dorsey.

Biography Marsden was born at 8 Menzies Street, Toxteth, Liverpool, to Frederick Marsden and Mary McAlindin. His interest in music began at an early age. He remembers standing on top of an air raid shelter singing \\"Ragtime Cowboy Joe\\" and getting a great reception from onlookers. Gerry and the Pacemakers was the second group signed by Brian Epstein and remained among his favourite artists. Their first single was \\"How Do You Do It,\\" recommended by George Martin after it was initially given to the Beatles. This was the first number one hit for the Pacemakers. It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios and was released on EMI's Columbia label. Marsden said the recording took four or five takes. The group's second number one was \\"I Like It\\", followed by \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\". Other singles included \\"It's Gonna Be Alright\\", \\"I'm the One\\", \\"Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying\\" and \\"Ferry Cross the Mersey\\". In 1965, Marsden married Pauline Behan; they have two daughters, Yvette and Victoria. After leaving the Pacemakers, Marsden maintained a low-key career on television, and starred in the West End musical Charlie Girl alongside Derek Nimmo and Anna Neagle. Marsden returned to #1 in the charts twice during the 1980s with re-recordings of two of his old hits, with all profits going to charity. In 1985 after the Bradford Football Club stadium tragedy in which 56 were killed, he formed a group called the Crowd, which included other musicians, singers and radio disc jockeys, to produce a new version of \\"You'll Never Walk Alone.\\" On 18 April 1989, three days after the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 Liverpool F.C. fans ultimately died as a result of their injuries, he joined forces with Paul McCartney, the Christians, Holly Johnson and his production trio Stock, Aitken & Waterman on a new version of \\"Ferry Cross the Mersey\\".

Translation from Irish: 'In memory of the heroes who fell in Dunboy on behalf of country and faith in June 1602. May their souls rest in peace.' Dunboy Castle () is a ruined castle on the Beara Peninsula in south-west Ireland near the town of Castletownbere. It was a stronghold of the O'Sullivan Bere, a Gaelic clan leader and 'Chief of Dunboy', and was built to guard and defend the harbour of Berehaven. Its presence enabled O'Sullivan Bere to control the sea fisheries off the Irish coast and collect taxes from Irish and continental European fishing vessels sheltering in the haven. It was also a centre for the import/export trade to and from the continent. Today, much of the castle is destroyed but the ruins are open to the public. Dunboy Castle was the scene of the noted Siege of Dunboy in the summer of 1602 which ultimately led to its destruction and the breaking of the power of the O'Sullivan Bere. At that time Donal Cam O'Sullivan Bere was in rebellion against the English crown, and Elizabeth I had sent a 5000-strong army under the command of Sir George Carew to suppress the insurgents. Even with its small garrison of 143 men, Dunboy Castle was thought to be impregnable but following a fierce artillery bombardment the walls were smashed and after some desperate hand-to-hand fighting amid the rubble the defenders were finally overcome. The 58 survivors of the two-week siege were executed in the nearby market square. Near the castle ruins stands Puxley Mansion, a 19th-century manor house. It was burnt by the IRA in 1920 in reprisal for the destruction of houses that harboured IRA men and weapons by the Crown Forces. While some restoration work was completed in the 2000s, funding issues halted plans to refurbish the mansion and open it as a hotel.

Under its founder Neil Bogart, Casablanca was most successful during the disco era of the mid to late 1970s. The label currently focuses on Dance and Electronic music under the direction of Rob Stevenson and Brett Alperowitz.  Biography  Casablanca was founded in 1973 by former Buddah Records executive Neil Bogart, who named the label in homage to the 1942 film Casablanca. He partnered with Cecil Holmes, Larry Harris and Buck Reingold in 1973, and was based in Los Angeles. The label was formed after they left Buddah and secured financing by Warner Bros. Records to start the venture. Casablanca became one of the most successful American labels of the 1970s, signing and releasing albums by such acts as Kiss, Donna Summer, Village People, Cher, Lipps Inc. (with lead vocalist Cynthia Johnson), and Parliament (featuring George Clinton). In 1976, the label merged with indie- film company Filmworks, Inc. headed by founder, Peter Guber to form Casablanca Record and FilmWorks, Inc., which had hits with the movies The Deep and Midnight Express. In 1977, PolyGram acquired a 50% stake of Casablanca for $15 million; in 1980, it purchased the remaining half. In 1980, one of the label's biggest acts, Donna Summer, departed to Geffen Records as she and Casablanca failed to agree on her musical direction for the future. That same year, PolyGram pushed Bogart out of Casablanca due to what it viewed as the label's overspending and accounting irregularities. The film division was separated from the label and renamed PolyGram Pictures. In the early 1980s, with Bogart no longer heading the label, Casablanca had hits with acts Lipps Inc, Stephanie Mills, Cameo (on sister label Chocolate City Records), and Irene Cara, but it did not have the same level of success it had enjoyed in the 1970s. The label was eventually shut down by PolyGram with some of the artist roster and catalog absorbed into sister label, Mercury Records. In 1999, PolyGram (including its subsidiaries) was purchased by Seagram and then merged with Seagram's MCA Music Entertainment Group to form the Universal Music Group. In 2000, the Casablanca Records name was revived for a joint venture between Universal Music Group and Tommy Mottola. In a Billboard article, Mottola said that he chose the name as a homage to the original label, but that there was no connection between the old and new labels. Casablanca is currently a dance and electronic label under Republic Records headed by GM, Brett Alperowitz.  History  Bogart was the head of Buddah Records, which was owned by the Viewlex Corporation. Also employed at Buddah Records were Holmes, Harris, and Reingold. Bogart had an unorthodox approach to the music business and he eventually grew tired of answering and conforming to Viewlex's business mode. In 1973, he arranged financing through Warner Bros. Records whereas he could start his own record label, which would be a subsidiary of Warner Bros. After much back and forth, the green light was eventually given by Warner and Bogart started the new label, bringing Harris, Holmes, and Reingold with him. Bogart called the label Casablanca as it was the name of his favorite film, and he also had the same last name as its star Humphrey Bogart. Also, since Warner Bros. owned the rights to the title of the film Casablanca, Bogart knew there would be no lawsuit against him regarding the name Casablanca Records. The label's first signing was the rock group Kiss, however, the label's first single was Bill Amesbury's \\"Virginia (Touch Me Like You Do)\\" which became a minor hit on the US Hot 100. \\"Butter Boy\\" by Fanny and The Hudson Brothers' \\"So You Are a Star\\" proved to be Casablanca's first Billboard Top 40 hits. From the time of its inception, Casablanca did not quite fit within the Warner scope of music, especially with the signing of a then-new act known as Kiss. Bogart was also quite brash and sure of himself, which rubbed some Warner staffers the wrong way. Thus, Casablanca experienced lukewarm relations with Warner Bros., its parent company. Warner manufactured and distributed albums for its own acts, as well as for all its subsidiary labels. Both Casablanca and Warner handled promotion for Casablanca artists. However, a few years later when Warner began experiencing manufacturing problems, it began focusing mainly on manufacturing albums by Warner acts and not so much the subsidiaries. Thus, Casablanca found itself with only modest success with its releases as it had limited distribution. Once Bogart realized this, he took the issue to Warner head Mo Ostin who had not been aware of the lack of attention being given to the subsidiary labels. Ostin, who did not feel strongly about the Casablanca venture anyway, decided to handle the situation by completely breaking Casablanca Records away from Warner Bros. and giving Bogart ownership of the label, thus making Casablanca an independent label. Bogart was thrilled at the opportunity to own his own record company outright and being able to make all the decisions, but he did pay Warner Bros. back in full in installment payments for the Casablanca label as opposed to taking it for free. The now-independent Casablanca Records was suddenly put in a tenuous financial situation as it still had yet to score a major hit album and no longer had the backing of Warner Bros. Casablanca was banking on the success of an upcoming album it was planning: a two-record set of audio highlights from television's The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. The album was entitled Here's Johnny: Magic Moments from The Tonight Show and was released in November 1974. Although the album was certified gold by the RIAA for shipments to stores of over 500,000 copies, the album did not sell well, and returns from retailers of unsold copies were high. Even the promotional copies were returned, initiating the joke that it shipped Gold and went back to the label Platinum. Casablanca had realized that even though The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson was immensely popular, the show did not carry over well to recordings.  Notable artists  = Kiss = Casablanca had released three albums by Kiss: Kiss (1974), Hotter Than Hell (1974), and Dressed to Kill (1975), but all had failed to make a big impact on the charts. The label also did not experience heavy sales with albums by Angel, who was introduced to the label by Gene Simmons of Kiss, although that glam rock band did amass a cult following. The label would have been on the verge of bankruptcy when Bogart decided to release a live album by Kiss. Although the band's studio albums had not been strong sellers, the band had a reputation for performing exciting shows. Casablanca decided to try to capitalize on that reputation by releasing the double-live Alive! (1975) album. It became both Casablanca's and Kiss's first top ten album and was certified gold. Kiss's follow-up studio albums to Alive! were better sellers than its previous studio albums. Destroyer (1976), Rock and Roll Over (1976), and Love Gun (1977) were all certified platinum in the United States. Other successful late 1970s Kiss albums on Casablanca were Alive II, Double Platinum, the band's four solo albums and Dynasty. Their less successful early 1980's works here were Unmasked and Music from The Elder. The band's last studio album on Casablanca was Creatures of the Night in 1982. = Donna Summer = In 1975, Casablanca signed Donna Summer and released her album Love to Love You Baby which was certified gold. Summer had several gold and platinum albums on Casablanca in 1975‚Äì1979 and was the label's most successful act on the singles chart. She recorded eight Top 5 singles in a 19-month period. Summer had 10 gold singles, 2 went platinum, and a gold maxi-single with Casablanca. Summer was called in the American press \\"The First Lady of Love\\", a name that she disliked but that Casablanca marketed with great success. She was called the queen of the disco era. Her hits included \\"Bad Girls\\", the Oscar and Grammy winning \\"Last Dance\\", the Grammy winning \\"Hot Stuff\\", and the hit single, \\"I Feel Love\\", co-written and produced by Giorgio Moroder. Her album Bad Girls achieved triple-platinum status. The label followed it with a greatest hits collection entitled On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I & II, which was certified double platinum and was Summer's last album on Casablanca. She recorded three double-albums that reached the top of the charts in a 14-month period. = Lipps, Inc. = In 1979 Lipps Inc., with Steven Greenberg as writer, producer, and musician, and Cynthia Johnson on lead vocals, signed with Casablanca. The single \\"Rock It\\" was released, followed by the album Mouth to Mouth. The album included the No.1 hit \\"Funkytown.\\" Funkytown spent four weeks at #1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts in the United States. The 7\\" single sold over two million copies within a few months and was awarded a platinum record within the same year of its release.[ Allmusic ‚Äì Funkytown Charting] It reached #2 in the United KingdomUK Charts Search 'Funkytown' and was a hit throughout the world. = Parliament = Parliament was signed to Casablanca in 1973 due to Bogart's long-standing relationship with group leader George Clinton. Their relationship dated to Bogart's period at Buddah Records. Their first release for the label was in 1974 with the album Up for the Down Stroke. The title song from the album gave Parliament its first top ten R&B; hit. Their next album, Chocolate City, sold approximately 150,000 albums in the Washington, D.C. area alone. But it was their next release, Mothership Connection, that gave the group its first gold and platinum album. Parliament achieved either gold or platinum status with each album release until 1980. The group's hit singles included \\"Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)\\", \\"Flash Light\\" (Casablanca's first R&B; number one hit) and \\"Aqua Boogie (A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop)\\". The success of Parliament allowed George Clinton to develop another P-Funk spin off act known as Parlet. Casablanca bankrolled the extravagant P-Funk stage shows, including the \\"Mothership Connection/P-Funk Earth Tour\\" of 1976‚Äì77 and the Motor Booty Affair underwater tour of 1979. Parliament was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. = Village People = Village People is an American disco group best known for their on-stage costumes, catchy tunes and suggestive lyrics. The group was originally formed by French producers Jacques Morali, Henri Belolo and lead singer Victor Willis following the release of the debut album, Village People, which targeted disco's gay audience. The group's name refers to New York City's Greenwich Village, at the time known for its large gay population, The characters were a symbolic group of gay and macho fantasy personas. The group quickly became popular and moved into the mainstream, scoring several disco and dance hits internationally under the label, including the hit singles \\"Macho Man\\", \\"In the Navy\\", \\"Go West\\" and their biggest hit, \\"Y.M.C.A.\\" = MIKA = MIKA's debut single, \\"Relax, Take It Easy\\", was released in 2006. His second single, \\"Grace Kelly\\", was released in January 2007 and debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, followed by his debut album, Life in Cartoon Motion, in February 2007. The single reached number 57 in the US. Other singles released were; \\"Love Today\\", \\"Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)\\", \\"Happy Ending\\", and \\"Lollipop\\". Mika's second album, The Boy Who Knew Too Much, followed in September 2009. The first single from the album, \\"We Are Golden\\", made its debut at number four in the UK. \\"Rain\\" and \\"Blame It on the Girls\\" were released as the second and third UK singles with both peaking at number seventy-two. His third studio album, The Origin of Love, was released in France on September 17, 2012, and in the United Kingdom on October 8, 2012. The album was preceded by an alternate lead single in each region. \\"Elle me dit\\" was first released in France, whereas \\"Celebrate\\" served as the first official single for the United Kingdom. = Lindsay Lohan = Lindsay Lohan signed on to the label in 2004, under the management of Tommy Mottola. She released her debut studio album, Speak in December 2004, peaking at number 4 on the Billboard 200 and eventually earning Platinum certification. Speak spawned Lohan's first single, \\"Rumors\\". Detailing Lohan's complaints with the paparazzi, \\"Rumors\\" eventually earned gold certification, as well as a nomination for Best Pop Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. Lohan released her second album, A Little More Personal (Raw) in December 2005. The album peaked at number 20 on the Billboard 200, gaining gold certification in early 2006. The first and only single from the album, \\"Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)\\", peaked at number 57 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Lohan's first single to debut on the chart. The song documents the problems Lohan has had in her family life, and the music video, which Lohan herself directed, features her younger sister Aliana. In June 2019, Page Six reported that Lohan had re-signed with Casablanca Records to record and release her third studio album, along with \\"a couple of soundtracks\\". = Ti√´sto = Ti√´sto's fifth studio album A Town Called Paradise was released on June 13, 2014. \\"Red Lights\\" was released as the lead single from the album on December 13, 2013. It was his first number one in Scotland, and peaked at number 6 on the UK Singles Chart. The song reached the top 10 in Australia, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. \\"Wasted\\" was released as the second single from the album on April 25, 2014. The song peaked at number 3 on the UK Singles Chart, and reached the top 10 in Sweden. \\"Light Years Away\\" was released as the album's third single on November 28, 2014. = Kungs = Kungs released his first extended play This Girl in 2016 following his remix of Cookin' on 3 Burners \\"This Girl\\", which reached number 1 in France, Germany and Switzerland and number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 2016.Peaks in the UK: * All except noted: * For \\"Don't You Know\\": He has since released the single \\"Don't You Know\\" featuring Jamie N Commons and \\"I Feel So Bad\\" featuring Ephemerals. Kungs' three 2016 singles were released on his debut album Layers, which was released on 4 November. On March 23, 2018 Kungs played a live set at the Miami Ultra Music Festival. He followed acts from fellow artists Raiden and Ksuke to perform his individual set on the 2018 Ultra Main Stage. = Martin Solveig = Martin Picandet (; born September 22, 1976), better known by his stage name Martin Solveig, is a French DJ, singer, songwriter and record producer. He hosts a weekly radio show called C'est La Vie on radio stations worldwide, including Radio FG in his homeland. His label is called Mixture Stereophonic. Solveig had been ranked number 29 in the 2011 DJ Mag. He has collaborated with Dragonette, Kele of Bloc Party, and Madonna. = SG Lewis = Britain's SG Lewis is an in-demand producer, songwriter, and DJ with an emotive, atmospheric approach to dance-oriented, electronic-based music. Initially known for his remixes of artists like Jessie Ware, he released his debut EP, Shivers, in 2015. Collaborations with vocalists such as Gallant (singer), Ray BLK, and Bishop Nehru followed, and Lewis released Dusk, the first EP in a three-part series dedicated to club culture, in 2018.  Other events  Casablanca started a subsidiary label in 1975 called Chocolate City Records. It was mainly overseen by Bogart's partner Cecil Holmes. The label focused on R&B;, funk, and disco releases. Chocolate City's signings included the then-new act Cameo and veteran act Brenda & the Tabulations. From 1976 to 1979, Casablanca also had another subsidiary label called Parachute Records. The label was run by former Motown Records promoter and Uni Records CEO Russ Regan. Artists signed to the label included singer Randy Brown, the heavily sampled disco group 7th Wonder, and songwriter-author-poet Shel Silverstein, who recorded one album for the label‚Äî1978's Songs and Stories. The offices of Casablanca moved into the former A&M; Records offices on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Casablanca's new offices were soon remodeled after the movie set of the film of the same name. Later, the record company merged with an indie production company called Filmworks, Inc., which was founded by former Columbia Pictures executive Peter Guber. The new company became known as Casablanca Record and Filmworks, with Bogart still at its helm as president, while Guber became Chairman of the Board and head of its film division. Guber would remain with the company for two years. In 1977, PolyGram acquired a 50% stake in the independent Casablanca, which had been quite successful for several years. Casablanca remained very successful throughout the rest of the 1970s. But the label's rise and fall would both be dramatic instances. The rise came with the success of several acts such as Donna Summer, Kiss, Parliament, and Village People, as well as some success from its subsidiary label and its film division. The fall began when the 1980s rolled in. The label was known to spend lavish amounts of money on parties, events, and promotion. Although this resulted in hit albums and singles, the profit margin suffered due to the carefree spending by the label. Casablanca spent lavish amounts of money on promoting its releases, which made its artists happy, but not necessarily PolyGram, which now owned a 50% stake in the label. When Casablanca's lavish spending habits were realized by PolyGram, it quickly made an offer to purchase the other 50% of Casablanca in 1980. Bogart accepted; however, he soon found out he would not be allowed to stay with Casablanca, and PolyGram released him from his post. He used the money he acquired from the sale to start Boardwalk Records and he signed then-new rocker Joan Jett, who had experienced some success in Japan as a member of the group The Runaways. Bogart died from cancer in 1982 and Boardwalk Records folded.  Post-Bogart years  Casablanca was not as successful without Bogart running the company. Its only notable releases from 1980 onward were the Robin Williams debut comedy LP Reality, What A Concept! (1981), the soundtrack to the movie Flashdance (1983), and the final three Kiss LP's on Casablanca: Unmasked, Music from \\"The Elder\\", and Creatures of the Night. Dusty Springfield's sole release on Casablanca, 1982's White Heat, came and went with little notice due to the label's mounting internal problems. The most successful act on the label during the 1980s was R&B; singer Stephanie Mills, who came to the label after PolyGram bought the 20th Century Fox Records label and absorbed its artists and back catalog into Casablanca. The last album released by the label was Animotion's Strange Behavior in 1986, which was a modest seller. By that time, PolyGram had folded Casablanca Records, moving some of its acts to Mercury Records and dropping others.  Official biography  In 2009, Casablanca co-founder Larry Harris released an insider's history of the label with a book entitled And Party Every Day: The Inside Story of Casablanca Records.  2000 relaunch  In 1998, Seagram purchased PolyGram and merged it with MCA Inc. to create the Universal Music Group. Upon the merger, the original (pre-2000) Casablanca Records music catalog became a part of The Island Def Jam Music Group, which folded in 2014. Reissues from the catalog became the responsibility of Island Records. In 2000, Universal and Tommy Mottola, who had served as CEO of Sony Music Entertainment and Columbia Records throughout the 1990s, partnered to launch a new record label that would be headed by Mottola and be part of the Universal Records Group. Mottola chose the name Casablanca, in homage to the Casablanca Records once run by Bogart. The label's first release was to be a girl-group first known as \\"iNK\\", but which later changed its name to \\"NSS (Not So Sweet) 16\\". The group, however, disbanded due to internal problems. NSS16's only single OopDeeWopDee was produced by hit music producer and Grammy award winner Greg Lawson and directed by Hakeem khaaliq. Some of Casablanca's releases included albums by Lindsay Lohan in 2004, albums by Lohan and Brie Larson in 2005, and music by Mika in 2007, who scored a hit with the song \\"Relax, Take It Easy\\". In 2006, an unknown at the time teenage Zariah Avana was signed to the label. Mottola's label once again become inactive when Lohan and Larson moved to other labels within the Universal family. In the fall of 2009, Casablanca became active again (albeit in name only) with the releases of Mika's second album, The Boy Who Knew Too Much, and Ryan Leslie's second album, Transition. = Releases = * Shall We Dance?

San Diego Bay is a natural harbor and deepwater port located in San Diego County, California near the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border. The bay, which is long and wide, is the third largest of the three large, protected natural bays on California's entire long coastline after San Francisco Bay and Humboldt Bay. The highly urbanized land adjacent to the bay includes the city of San Diego (eighth largest city in the United States) and four other cities: National City, Chula Vista, Imperial Beach and Coronado. Beach at Border State Park; San Diego is on the right while Tijuana, Mexico is on the left. Considered to be one of the best natural harbors on the west coast of North America, it was colonized by Spain beginning in 1769. Later it served as base headquarters of major ships of the United States Navy in the Pacific until just before the United States entered World War II, when the newly organized United States Pacific Fleet primary base was transferred to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. However, San Diego Bay remains as a home port of major assets, including several aircraft carriers, of the United States Pacific Fleet, and as a result of base closures beginning in the 1980s, facilities in San Diego Bay are the major naval base facilities still in operation in California. Ports The Port of San Diego has two container ship facilities (one for refrigerated containers) and a cruise ship terminal. A second cruise ship terminal opened in December 2010. The port handles more than 3 million metric tons of cargo yearly. The cruise ship terminal hosted more than 250 ship calls a year totaling more than 800,000 passengers at its peak in 2008; since then the number of ship calls has fallen to fewer than 100 per year due to the withdrawal of regular service by major cruise lines. General Dynamics' National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO), the only shipyard on the west coast capable of building and repairing large ocean-going vessels, is near the San Diego side of the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge. San Diego International Airport is also adjacent to the bay, across Harbor Drive from the Coast Guard Station. San Diego‚ÄìCoronado Bridge The bay is spanned by the San Diego‚ÄìCoronado Bridge, built in 1969. The bridge curves and rises to a height of 200 feet above the water so that Navy ships can pass under it. (However, the vertical clearance is insufficient for Nimitz-class aircraft carriers, which is why these are docked north of the bridge.) The bridge was originally a toll bridge; however, toll collection was discontinued in 2002, when the bridge's construction loans were paid in full. America's Cup Harbor Formerly known as Commercial Basin and housing much of San Diego's sport and commercial fishing fleet, the small cove in the southern lee of Shelter Island was renamed in 1994 to America's Cup Harbor, in honor of the 1995 America's Cup races held in San Diego. America's Cup Harbor has several boat yards and marinas for private sailing yachts, as well as a mooring field. Recreation The Star of India Numerous resorts, hotels, and the San Diego Convention Center are adjacent to the Bay. Several parks and nature preserves are found at various locations along the shoreline. Sightseeing boats depart from the downtown area. Commercial sport fishing and whale watching tours depart from Shelter Island. Ten museum ships call San Diego Bay home. They include the USS Midway, an aircraft carrier museum, and the Star of India, the oldest iron-hulled merchant ship afloat and the world's oldest active sailing ship. The Star of India and eight other ships and boats on San Diego Bay are the floating collection of the San Diego Maritime Museum; they are open to the public for a fee, and many are in sailing condition. In the northern part of the bay there are two commercial \\"islands\\" (actually peninsulas connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land) called Harbor Island and Shelter Island. They were built up from former sand bars and now hold hotels, restaurants, marinas, and public parkland. Across from Harbor Island is a bayside park called Spanish Landing, a historic site which commemorates the meeting in 1769 of two expeditions from Spanish Mexico that made possible the European settlement of California. Spanish Landing park is the site of San Salvador Village, where the San Diego Maritime Museum is constructing a full- sized, fully functional wooden replica of the San Salvador flagship, in which explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo discovered San Diego Bay in 1542. Small boat sailing is extremely popular, and the bay is lined by dozens of marinas and nine yacht clubs, including the San Diego Yacht Club which was the home of the America's Cup from 1988 to 1995. For tourists and locals alike there many businesses that offer jet ski rental and boat rental to explore the scenic waterway. An inlet of the bay was renamed America's Cup Harbor to commemorate that occasion. =Special events= An annual fireworks display called the Big Bay Boom is held on the Fourth of July over the waters of the Bay. Fireworks are launched simultaneously from four barges in the Bay as well as from a pier in Imperial Beach. It is one of the largest annual fireworks displays in the United States and is viewed by half a million people each year. The Parade of Lights is a parade of more than 80 small boats with holiday decorations and lights on two Sundays in December. The parade has been held annually since 1972. The parade starts off Shelter Island and proceeds past Harbor Island and Downtown, finishing at the Coronado ferry landing. A one-time special event was the \\"Parade of Flight\\" in February 2011, celebrating the 100th anniversary of naval aviation. It featured flights over San Diego Bay by more than 200 historic naval aircraft, and concluded with a flyover by the air wing from the U.S.S. John C. Stennis. Naval facilities A plane flying over the Bay The western border of the bay is protected from the Pacific Ocean by a long, narrow strip of land called the Silver Strand. The northern end of the Silver Strand expands to become North Island, the location of Naval Air Station North Island (the home port of several aircraft carriers including the USS Theodore Roosevelt) and Coronado. Coronado is the site of the famous Hotel del Coronado. The U.S. Navy has three other facilities on the bay: Naval Station San Diego, Naval Base Point Loma at Ballast Point, which is a Nuclear Submarine base, and Naval Amphibious Base Coronado. The Coast Guard Air Station San Diego is across the bay from NAS North Island and the Federal Communications Commission maintains a monitoring station on the Silver Strand. Several other Navy facilities are located in the surrounding area, and even more existed previously but have since been closed. The U.S. Marine Corps also operates one of its two Recruit Depots near the shores of San Diego Bay. Ecology San Diego Bay & Coronado Islands at sunset. The shallow southern end of the bay is used for evaporation ponds to extract salt from the sea water. The salt ponds, the Sweetwater Marsh, and other areas of the bay are included in the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge Complex. The area includes the largest contiguous mud-flat in Southern California. It is an important stop on the Pacific Flyway for migrating birds, and it supports numerous endangered and threatened species of plants and animals. Public access to the bay and wetlands, with walking trails and educational exhibits about the area's ecological resources, is provided at the Chula Vista Nature Center operated by the city of Chula Vista. San Diego Bay is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy.State Water Resources Control Board Water Quality Control Policy for the Enclosed Bays and Estuaries of California (1974) State of California As early as the 1840s whales were documented in the bay during the winter, with as many as fifteen seen in the bay in 1872; in 1858 whaling stations began to operate in San Diego, having ended operations as late as 1886. =Pollution= Sources of pollution in the Bay include storm-water runoff and marine waste from commercial and military shipping and shipbuilding. The city of San Diego has spent millions of dollars trying to clean up this pollution, particularly at the section of the eastern shoreline referred to as the Shipyards Sediment Site. In 2009 the city and the San Diego Unified Port Authority filed suit against several major shipping companies to recoup some of the cost of those remediation efforts. In 2014 the city reached an agreement with the San Diego Regional Water Control Board to pay a fine of nearly $1 million for storm-water violations. In 2015, the city and the Port filed suit against Monsanto, whose products containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are blamed for pollution of the Bay and tidelands. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for fish caught in the Salton Sea based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in local species. Management The Port of San Diego manages the harbor and administers the public lands adjacent to the bay. The Port is a special government entity created by the state legislature in 1962, for which revenue consists of tariffs and rents paid by district tenants. Treaty of Guadalupe Hildago San Diego Bay (called the \\"port of San Diego\\") is referenced in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo as the westernmost of the landmarks used in the resolution of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The border is defined as being \\"one marine league\\" (3 nautical miles, 3.452 mi. or 5.556 km) \\"due south of the southernmost point\\" of the bay.

It was known as the Manitoba Confederation of Regions Party (CoR) in the provincial elections of 1986, 1988 and 1990. Confederation of Regions The Manitoba Confederation of Regions Party was the provincial branch of the Confederation of Regions Party of Canada, a right-wing organization which sought greater autonomy for Western Canada. Unlike the Western Canada Concept and the Western Independence Party, the CoR did not advocate full independence for the western provinces. The national party leader was Elmer Knutson; its original provincial leader was Douglas Edmondson. The Manitoba CoR was founded in 1984, as a result of public controversy over New Democratic Party Premier Howard Pawley's attempts to entrench francophone services in the province. The CoR opposed any expansion of French language rights. The national CoR Party polled surprisingly well in the 1984 federal election in Manitoba, placing second to the Progressive Conservatives in three rural anglophone ridings. The party, as such, hoped to elect candidates to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the general election of 1986. The party ran 15 candidates in 1986, and managed to place second in four rural ridings (Arthur, Gladstone, Pembina and Rhineland). None of the CoR's candidates came close to victory; Dennis Heeney, who had replaced Edmondson as leader, placed third in Minnedosa. The CoR ran 14 candidates in 1988. Despite a high-profile endorsement of the party from former Premier Douglas Campbell, no candidate placed higher than a distant third. Dennis Heeney appears to have stepped down as party leader following the election. In 1990, only five candidates ran under the CoR banner. Irene Armishaw was the party's president. Armishaw received the largest number of votes of any of the party's candidates‚Äî486 votes in the rural riding of Lakeside. In April 1991, the Manitoba CoR changed its name to the Manitoba Reform Party after a mail-in referendum among party members conducted in March and April, in which 67% of the respondents were said to have favoured the change. (The Manitoba CoR had 65-70 members by this time.) The new name brought about a lawsuit from the Reform Party of Canada, which had no formal connection to the Manitoba group. National CoR leader Elmer Knutson was also opposed to the change. Manitoba Reformers argued that as no other group had applied to use the name on a provincial level. The Court of Appeals in Manitoba determined in 1991 that party's use of the word \\"Reform\\" at the provincial level was legal. In September 1992, the Manitoba Reform Party contested two provincial by- elections. Ken Carver received 97 votes in Crescentwood, and anti-bilingualism activist Fred Debrecen received 388 votes in Portage la Prairie. The party was registered with Elections Manitoba for the 1995 provincial election, but did not run any candidates. Its subsequent history is unclear.

The cast also included Joan Rice, Andr√© Morell, Abraham Sofaer, Archie Savage, and Benson Fong. The screenplay by Borden Chase and James Hill was based on the novel of the same name by Laurence Klingman and Gerald Green (1952). Plot summary Captain David O'Keefe, seeking his fortune in the 19th century South Pacific, decides to enlist island natives to harvest copra, but runs into a wall of cultural problems. Backed by a Chinese dentist, he obtains a ship and sets about harvesting copra while fending off cantankerous native chieftains and ambitious German empire-builders. The natives, happy with their existence, see no reason to work hard to obtain copra, either for a German trading company or for O'Keefe. He finally motivates them by showing them how to produce large quantities of Rai stones, the stone money of Yap, their valued coinage. Cast Historical basis coin\\" from the village of Gachpar, on Yap. The story is based on the life of a sailor named David O'Keefe who in 1871 was shipwrecked on Yap in the Caroline Islands, where he found the natives highly prized Rai stones quarried at great effort and danger on the island of Palau. He organized the natives to produce the large stone disks by employing modern methods and then used them to buy copra for coconut oil. The stones he produced were not valued as highly as those obtained by traditional methods due to the lack of personal sacrifice in their production, and the effect of an inflationary over-production.

While in the Middle Ages a saucer was used for serving condiments and sauces,Webster's Dictionary currently the term is used to denote a small plate or shallow bowl that supports a cup ‚Äì usually one used to serve coffee or tea. The center of the saucer often contains a depression or raised ring sized to fit a matching cup; this was only introduced in the mid 18th century. The saucer is useful for protecting surfaces from possible damage due to the heat of a cup, and to catch overflow, splashes, and drips from the cup, thus protecting both table linen and the user sitting in a free- standing chair who holds both cup and saucer. The saucer also provides a convenient place for a wet spoon, as might be used to stir the drink in the cup in order to mix sweeteners or creamers into tea or coffee. Some people pour the hot tea or coffee from the cup into the saucer;Victoriana Blog, with paintingsWashington and Jefferson senatorial saucer, 9th para. the increased surface area of the liquid exposed to the air increases the rate at which it cools, allowing the drinker to consume the beverage quickly after preparation. This was very common in the 18th century, but by the end of it was considered vulgar. Although often part of a place setting in a tea or dinner set, teacups with unique styling are often sold with matching saucers, sometimes alone, or as part of a tea set, including a teapot and small dessert plates. Thermal transport When placed beneath a cup, saucers have very little direct influence on beverage cooling rate. For hot, water based beverages (e.g. tea or coffee), cooling rate in a cup is typically dominated by evaporation, which occurs across the free surface in contact with the air. Heat transfer through the bottom of the cup is small relative to heat lost through the top of the cup. Further reducing the heat lost through the bottom of the cup has little effect on the cooling rate of the beverage. Placing a saucer on top of a cup, however, inhibits evaporative cooling and is thus an effective way of reducing the cooling rate so that the drink remains warmer for longer.

Flannel was originally made from carded wool or worsted yarn, but is now often made from either wool, cotton, or synthetic fiber. Flannel may be brushed to create extra softness or remain unbrushed. Brushing is a mechanical process wherein a fine metal brush rubs the fabric to raise fine fibres from the loosely spun yarns to form a nap on one or both sides. If the flannel is not napped, it gains its softness through the loosely spun yarn in its woven form. Flannel is commonly used to make tartan clothing, blankets, bed sheets, and sleepwear. The term \\"flannel shirt\\" is often mistakenly used to refer to any shirt with a plaid or tartan pattern casually. However, it is actually just a form of fabric and there can be flannel shirts that are not plaid. History The origin of the word is uncertain, but a Welsh origin has been suggested as fabric similar to flannel can be traced back to Wales, where it was well known as early as the 16th century. The French term flanelle was used in the late 17th century, and the German Flanell was used in the early 18th century. Flannel has been made since the 17th century, gradually replacing the older Welsh plains, some of which were finished as \\"cottons\\" or friezes, which was the local textile product. In the 19th century, flannel was made particularly in towns such as Newtown, Montgomeryshire,Newtown History Hay on Wye,Clwyd- Powys Archaeological Trust - Projects - Historic Landscapes - Middle Wye - Administrative Landscapes and Llanidloes.Llanidloes History The expansion of its production is closely associated with the spread of carding mills, which prepared the wool for spinning, this being the first aspect of the production of woollen cloth to be mechanised (apart from fulling). The marketing of these Welsh woollen clothes was largely controlled by the Drapers Company of Shrewsbury. At one time Welsh, Yorkshire, Lancashire and Irish flannels differed slightly in character due largely to the grade of raw wool used in the several localities, some being softer and finer than others. While nowadays, the colour of flannel is determined by dyes, originally this was achieved through mixing white, blue, brown and black wools in varying proportions. Lighter shades were achieved by bleaching with sulphur dioxide. Originally it was made of fine, short staple wool, but by the 20th century mixtures of silk and cotton had become common. It was at this time that flannel trousers became popular in sports, especially cricket, in which it was used extensively until the late 1970s. The use of flannel plaid shirts was at peak in the 1990s with popular grunge bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam using them as one of the trademarks of their shaggy look. However, few of the mass- produced plaid shirts available at the time were actually made out of flannel. The association between flannel and plaid has led to the use of flannel as a synonym for plaid. Types Flannelette typically refers to a napped cotton fabric imitating the texture of flannel. The weft is generally coarser than the warp. The flannel-like appearance is created by creating a nap from the weft; scratching it and raising it up. Flannelette can either have long or short nap, and can be napped on one or two sides. It comes in many colours, both solid and patterned. * Baby flannel is a lightweight fabric used for childrenswear. * Cotton flannel or Canton flannel is a cotton fabric napped on one side or two sides. * Ceylon flannel was a name for a wool and cotton mixture.The Concise Household Encyclopedia (c. 1935) The Amalgamated Press, London * Diaper flannel is a stout cotton fabric napped on both sides, and used for making cloth diapers. * Vegetable flannel, invented by L√©opold Lairitz in Germany in the 1800s, uses fibres from the Scots pine rather than wool. Weave Flannel, flannelette, and cotton flannel can be woven in either a twill weave or plain weave. The weave is often hidden by napping on one or both sides. After weaving, it is napped once, then bleached, dyed, or otherwise treated, and then napped a second time.

The film revolves around Jack, a pure being who must stop the Lord of Darkness who plots to cover the world with eternal night. It is often described as a dark fairy tale and as a return to more original and sometimes disturbing fables originating from the oral tradition of ancient times before reading and writing were widespread.Meslow, Scott (May 31, 2012). \\"Fairy Tales Started Dark, Got Cute, and Are Now Getting Dark Again.\\" TheAtlantic.com. Retrieved June 5, 2012. Although not a commercial success when first released, it won the British Society of Cinematographers Award for Best Cinematography in 1985 for cinematographer Alex Thomson, as well as being nominated for multiple awards: Oscar for Best Makeup; Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films Saturn Award for Best Makeup; BAFTA Awards for Best Costume Design, Best Makeup Artist, Best Special Visual Effects; DVD Exclusive Awards; and Young Artist Awards. Since its premiere and the subsequent release of the unrated Director's Cut, the film has become a cult classic. Plot In order to cast the world into eternal night, the Lord of Darkness sends the goblin Blix on a mission to kill the unicorns in the forest near his castle that guard the light and bring him their horns. Blix and his colleagues Pox and Blunder follow impetuous Princess Lili as she visits her forest-dwelling paramour Jack O'Greene, and they kiss for hours in the forest. After failed attempts to progress their relationship, Jack takes Lili to the lair of the unicorns. This is something that would be forbidden amongst mortals, had Jack not blindfolded Lili to keep the location hidden, and did all of it out of love. However, Lili distracts the stallion by stroking it, another forbidden act, allowing Blix to shoot it with a poison dart from his blowpipe, and the unicorns flee. With the couple unaware of the goblins, Lili makes light of Jack's fears concerning her sin and sets him a challenge by throwing her ring into a pond, declaring she will marry whoever finds it. While Jack dives in after the ring, the goblins find the dying stallion and sever its alicorn. An apocalyptic winter descends; Lili runs off in terror and Jack is barely able to break through the surface of the now frozen pond. Lili takes refuge in the frozen cottage of a kind and friendly family. There, Lili sees the goblins testing the alicorn's magical powers, and overhears from them about how she had a role in their slaying of the stallion, and by doing so, casting the dark winter onto the world. She follows the goblins to a rendezvous with Darkness, who tells them the world cannot be cast into eternal night as long as the surviving mare still lives. Blunder valiantly but unsuccessfully tries using the alicorn to overthrow Darkness and is taken away to his castle. Meanwhile, Jack, accompanied by the forest elf Honeythorn Gump, the fairy Oona, and the dwarves Brown Tom and Screwball, finds the mare mourning the lifeless stallion. Lamenting over his role in their current predicament, Jack cries and apologizes to the mare, who tells him the alicorn must be recovered and returned to the stallion. Leaving Brown Tom to guard the unicorns, Jack and the others retrieve a hidden cache of ancient weapons and armor. While they are gone, Lili tries to help make things right by helping to save the mare from the goblins, but they overpower Tom and capture both the mare and Lili. Learning of what has transpired, Jack and his group make their way to the castle in the middle of a swamp. On the way, they are nearly killed by a swamp hag named Meg Mucklebones, but defeat her by flattering her appearance and then decapitating her. After reaching the castle, Jack's group falls into an underground prison cell in a hellish kitchen. They encounter Blunder in the same cell, revealed to be an elf gone astray, before he is dragged off by an ogre cook to be baked into a pie. Oona offers to use her magic to escape their cell and retrieve keys to free the others if she receives a kiss from Jack. He is tempted when Oona turns into an amorous Lili, but refuses to follow through, telling her \\"human hearts don't work that way\\". Oona is greatly offended and scolds Jack, reminding him it was his lust that caused the apocalypse. Despite this, she remembers what's at stake and frees everyone so they can all search for Lili and the mare. Having fallen in love with Lili, Darkness tempts her with jewelry, a beautiful dress and promises of power and glory. Seemingly seduced, she agrees to wed him under the condition that she will be the one to kill the mare in the upcoming ritual. Overhearing their conversation, Jack and Gump learn that Darkness can be destroyed by daylight. After saving Blunder, the group takes the ogres' giant metal platters to reflect the sunlight to the chamber where the mare is to be sacrificed. As the ritual begins, Lili frees the mare, but is knocked out by Darkness. While the others relay the light of the setting sun using the platters, Jack fights Darkness, finally wounding him with the severed alicorn. As the redirected sunlight blasts him to the edge of a void, Darkness warns them that because evil lurks in everyone, he will never truly be vanquished. Jack hesitates as he realizes this to be true, but overcomes his doubt and severs the evil hand holding the alicorn, thus expelling him into the void. Gump returns the stallion's horn, returning him to life and ending the winter. Jack retrieves the mystic ring from the pond and returns it to Lili, returning her to life. =Alternate endings= There are three different versions of the film‚Äôs conclusion: *In the Director's Cut, Lili wakes with Jack trying to convince her she was merely dreaming, but she is ultimately unconvinced. They confess their true love for each other, but realize they live in two different lifestyles, which causes Lili to request continuing a merely platonic relationship. Jack, happy with this request for the first time, accepts. Lili returns to her home to assume her responsibilities, promising to visit him again. Jack happily runs off into the sunset, hailed by the forest fairies and the revived unicorns. *In the American theatrical version, Jack and Lili assure each other of their love and watch the unicorns reunite, and they run off into the sunset together, hailed by the forest fairies and the unicorns.

Production Ridley Scott in 2012 =Development= While filming The Duellists in France, Ridley Scott conceived Legend after another planned project, Tristan and Isolde, fell through temporarily. However, he believed that it would be an art film with limited audience appeal and went on to make Alien and did pre-production work on Dune, another halted project, which was eventually finished by director David Lynch. Frustrated, he came back to the idea of filming a fairy tale or mythological story. For inspiration, Scott read all the classic fairy tales, including ones by the Brothers Grimm. From that, he conceived a story about a young hermit who is transformed into a hero when he battles the Darkness in order to rescue a beautiful princess and release the world from a wintery curse. =Screenplay= Scott wanted Legend to have an original screenplay because he believed that \\"it was far easier to design a story to fit the medium of cinema than bend the medium for an established story\\". By chance, he discovered several books written by American novelist William Hjortsberg, and found that the writer had already written several scripts for some unmade lower-budgeted films. Scott asked him if he was interested in writing a fairy tale. He was already writing some and agreed. Scott remembers, \\"The first notion was to actually make a classical fairy story, but if you actually analyze a classical fairy story, most are either very short, or very complex\\". The two men bonded over Jean Cocteau's 1946 film of Beauty and the Beast. In January 1981, just before beginning principal photography on Blade Runner, Scott spent five weeks with Hjortsberg working out a rough storyline for what was then called Legend of Darkness. Originally, Scott \\"only had the vague notion of something in pursuit of the swiftest steed alive which, of course, was the unicorn\\". Scott felt that they should have a quest and wanted unicorns as well as magic armor and a sword. Hjortsberg suggested plunging the world into wintery darkness. Hjortsberg's first draft of Legend of Darkness also had Princess Lili slowly transform into a clawed and fur-covered beast who is whipped and sexually seduced by the antagonist (called Baron Couer De Noir in this draft). Scott wanted to show the outside world as little as possible and they settled on the clockmaker's cottage. Initially, the quest was longer, but it was eventually substantially reduced. Scott wanted to avoid too many subplots that departed from the main story and go for a \\"more contemporary movement rather than get bogged down in too classical a format\\". By the time Scott had finished Blade Runner, he and Hjortsberg had a script that was \\"lengthy, hugely expensive, and impractical in its size and scope\\". They went through it and took out large sections that were secondary to the story. The two men went through 15 script revisions. =Pre-production= The look Scott envisioned for Legend was influenced by the style of Disney animation. He had even offered the project to Disney, but they were intimidated by the film's dark tone at a time when Disney still focused on family-friendly material. Visually, he referenced films like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia and Pinocchio.Jones 1986, p. 24. Early on, Scott worked with Alan Lee as a visual consultant who drew some characters and sketched environments. However, Scott eventually replaced Lee with Assheton Gorton, a production designer whom he had wanted for both Alien and Blade Runner. Scott hired Gorton because he knew \\"all the pitfalls of shooting exteriors on a soundstage. We both knew that whatever we did would never look absolutely real, but would very quickly gain its own reality and dispense with any feeling of theatricality\\". Scott also consulted with effects expert Richard Edlund because the director did not want to limit major character roles to the number of smaller people who could act. At one point, the director considered Mickey Rooney to play one of the major characters but he did not look small enough next to Tom Cruise. Edlund considered shooting on 70 mm film stock, taking the negative, and reducing the actors to any size they wanted‚Äîbut this was deemed too expensive. Thus, Scott was tasked with finding an ensemble of small actors. Legend would be financed with a budget of $24.5 million, and would be distributed by Universal Pictures in North America and by 20th Century Fox in all other territories. Sequoias of Yosemite National Park In order to achieve the look of Legend that he wanted, Scott scouted locations in the Sequoias of Yosemite National Park to see the grand scale of trees there. \\"The whole environment is so stunning ... It was so impressive, but I didn't know how you would control it\\". However, it would cost too much to shoot on location and he decided to build a forest set on the 007 Stage, named after and used for many James Bond films, at Pinewood Studios. The crew spent 14 weeks constructing the forest set, and Scott was worried that it would not look real enough. It was only days before the start of principal photography that it looked good enough to film. The trees were 60 feet high with trunks 30 feet in diameter and were sculpted out of polystyrene built onto tubular scaffolding frames. In addition, other sets were constructed on five huge soundstages. =Casting= Johnny Depp, Jim Carrey and Robert Downey Jr. were considered for the role of Jack. While Scott was considering Richard O'Brien to play Meg Mucklebones, he watched The Rocky Horror Picture Show and saw Tim Curry. He thought the actor would be ideal to play Darkness because the actor had film and theatrical experience. Tim Curry's makeup as Darkness in Legend is considered to be one of the most iconic images in all of fantasy cinema.Monfette, Christopher (May 12, 2009). \\"Top 10 Angels and Demons.\\" IGN.com. Retrieved June 5, 2012. Scott discovered Mia Sara in a casting session and was impressed by her \\"good theatrical instincts\\".Pirani December 1985, p. 66 =Makeup effects= Scott contacted Rob Bottin, who designed the special makeup effects for The Howling, about working on Blade Runner, but Bottin was already committed to John Carpenter's The Thing. Scott told him about Legend, and toward the end of production on The Thing, Bottin read a script for the film and saw an excellent opportunity to create characters in starring roles. After wrapping his work with Carpenter, Bottin met with Scott to reduce the thousands of creatures suggested by the script to a manageable quantity. The process would involve complicated prosthetic makeup that would be worn for up to 60 days with some full body prosthetics. According to Bottin, at the time, Legend had the largest makeup crew ever dedicated to one project. Bottin divided his facility into different shops in order to cover the immense workload. As actors were cast, Bottin and his crew began making life casts and designed characters on drafting paper laid over sketches of the actors' faces. He designed the prosthetics in his Los Angeles studio and spent some time in England occasionally helping with the application of makeup.Pirani December 1985, p. 65 Curry's makeup for the film took five and a half hours to apply. With the exception of Cruise and Sara, all the principal actors spent hours every morning having extensive makeup applied. Between 8 and 12 prosthetic pieces were applied individually to each face, then made up, molded and grafted into the actor's face so that the prosthetics moved with their muscles. Each person needed three makeup artists working on them for an average time of three and a half hours spent applying prosthetics. Actor Tim Curry took five and a half hours because his entire body was encased in makeup, the film's most challenging character design.Biodrowski 1986, p. 26 Curry had to wear a large, bull-like structure atop his head with three-foot fiberglass horns supported by a harness underneath the makeup.Biodrowski 1986, p. 57 The initial design of the horns placed a strain on the back of the actor's neck because they extended forward and not straight up but Bottin and his crew eventually reduced the weight of the horns. At the end of the day, he spent an hour in a bath in order to liquefy the soluble spirit gum. At one point, Curry became claustrophobic, got too impatient, and pulled the makeup off too quickly, tearing off his own skin in the process. Scott had to shoot around the actor for a week as a result. =Principal photography= Principal photography began on March 26, 1984 on the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios. On June 27, 1984, with ten days filming left on this stage, the entire set burned down during a lunch break. Reportedly, flames from the set fire leapt more than 100 feet into the air and the clouds of smoke could be seen five miles away. It occurred during lunchtime, and no one was hurt. Scott quickly made changes to the shooting schedule and only lost three days moving to another soundstage. Meanwhile, the art department rebuilt the section of the forest set that was needed to complete filming. Due to the fire, the scenes of Lili meeting the unicorns for the first time and finding the cottages in the snow were filmed in the garden of the main house behind Shepperton Studios.Ridley Scott DVD Commentary for \\"Legend: Ultimate Edition\\", Disc 2, Universal Studios Home Video, 2002. The underwater scenes were filmed in Silver Springs, Florida for the \\"purity\\" of the water. Cruise did all his own diving and swimming in waters that, according to Scott, had real alligators 25 feet from where they were filming. =Post-production= Scott's first cut of Legend ran 125 minutes long.Jones 1986, p. 27. He then believed there were minor plot points that could be trimmed and cut the film down to 113 minutes, so he tested this version for an audience in Orange County. However, it was decided that the audience had to work too much to be entertained, and another 20 minutes was cut. The 95-minute version was shown in Great Britain and then the film was cut down even further to 89 minutes for North America. At the time, Scott said, \\"European audiences are more sophisticated. They accepted preambles and subtleties whereas the U.S. goes for a much broader stroke.\\" He and Universal delayed the North American theatrical release until 1986 so that they could replace Jerry Goldsmith's score with music by Tangerine Dream, Yes lead singer Jon Anderson, and Bryan Ferry. Scott allowed Goldsmith's score to remain on European prints and the composer said, \\"that this dreamy, bucolic setting is suddenly to be scored by a techno-pop group seems sort of strange to me\\". Normally, Goldsmith would spend 6‚Äì10 weeks on a film score, but for Legend, he spent six months writing songs and dance sequences ahead of time. In 2000, Universal unearthed an answer print of the 113-minute preview cut with Jerry Goldsmith's score. This print had minor visual anomalies that were eventually digitally replaced, occasionally with finished shots from the 89-minute U.S. version. This edition is Scott's preferred 2002 \\"Director's Cut\\", with the restored Jerry Goldsmith soundtracks. The Director's Cut's source is one of only two prints of this extended version known to exist, used for Universal's 2002 DVD (and eventual Blu-ray) \\"Ultimate Edition.\\" Reception Legend received mixed reviews. The film currently holds a 38% \\"Rotten\\" approval rating on the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 4.87/10. The consensus reads: \\"Not even Ridley Scott's gorgeously realized set pieces can save Legend from its own tawdry tale -- though it may be serviceable for those simply looking for fantasy eye candy.\\" Steve Biodrowski of Cinefantastique praised the film, highlighting the makeup design by Rob Bottin and Tim Curry's performance as Darkness, saying that \\"[b]ecause of the visuals (and Curry's performance, which is mostly limited to the last 20 minutes), the film is worth seeing\\".Browse: Home / DVD, Movies, Reviews / Legend (1985) ‚Äì Retrospective Film & DVD Review + Legend (1985) ‚Äì Retrospective Film & DVD Review Widgett Walls of needcoffee.com also praised the film, once again highlighting Bottin's makeup, focusing on the character of Darkness, saying simply that \\"Tim Curry's Darkness is absolutely incredible.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times said that \\"[i]t's a slap-dash amalgam of Old Testament, King Arthur, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and any number of comic books.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised the visuals as \\"a sumptuous, richly colored feast for cinematographer Alex Gordon's camera\\", but thought the film \\"surely could have used more humor and invention\\".Thomas, Kevin (April 18, 1986). \\"'Legend': Light, Dark and Unicorns\\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 4. Kim Newman of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that \\"like Blade Runner before it, the film suffers so much from an over-emphasis on details at the expense of the actual story that it becomes a plodding bore.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film half of one star out of four and stated that writing the review was \\"akin to recalling a bad dream\\", concluding that \\"I don't want to remember any more about Legend than to make sure I include it in my 'worst films of 1986' list and never rent it when it comes out as a video cassette.\\"Siskel, Gene (April 18, 1986). \\"'Legend' may become one, but for all the wrong reasons\\". Chicago Tribune, Section 7, p. N. The film has been described as the \\"extinction event\\" that discouraged Hollywood from making fantasy films.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/legend- ridley-scott/tom-cruise-making-of/ Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Bottin's makeup and Assheton Gorton's set design and the performances of Tim Curry and Tom Cruise, but noted that the effects were so good that the roles could have been played by almost anyone. Ebert also said that the movie was composed of all of the right ingredients to be successful, but that the film simply \\"doesn't work\\". He went on to say that \\"[a]ll of the special effects in the world, and all of the great makeup, and all of the great Muppet creatures can't save a movie that has no clear idea of its own mission and no joy in its own accomplishment\\". However, with the release of the 2002 Director's Cut, he agreed with many fans on how it was intended to question the balance between good and evil, and gives the main characters moral flaws to display the imperfections of humans. The release of the Director's Cut in 2002 also had the original score from Jerry Goldsmith restored, and brought renewed attention to the film. Both Ridley Scott and Tom Cruise have requested their fans to view this version, even to the extent of Cruise disowning the US version entirely as a \\"stereotypical 80's fantasy\\". Soundtrack Due to the changes in the film from its European and American releases, Legend has two different soundtracks. The first, produced, composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith, was used for its initial European release and restored in the director's cut edition of the Region 1 DVD release. The second soundtrack features music by German electronic artists Tangerine Dream and was used for the initial theatrical and home video releases in the United States. This soundtrack also includes songs by Jon Anderson of Yes and Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music. The following songs are featured in the European and Director's Cuts, with lyrics composed by John Bettis (composer of many Carpenters songs) and music by Jerry Goldsmith: * \\"My True Love's Eyes\\" (the main theme, sung mostly by Lili. Mia Sara provided some of the singing, while session singers provided vocals wherever Sara was unable to perform). * \\"Living River\\" (the first reprise of \\"My True Love's Eyes\\", sung as Lili calls to the unicorn). * \\"Bumps and Hollows\\" (sung by Lili after her forbidden act of touching a unicorn). * \\"Sing The Wee\\" (the theme for the fairies. The first sung version was cut from all editions of the film as it accompanied a scene with Jack and the fairies that was itself cut; the final sung version by the National Philharmonic Chorus is heard over the end credits). * \\"Reunited\\" (the final reprise of \\"My True Love's Eyes\\", sung by Lili as she says goodbye to Jack). The following songs appeared in the 89-minute U.S. re-cut when it was re-scored by Tangerine Dream: * \\"Loved by the Sun\\" (music by Tangerine Dream, lyrics written and sung by Jon Anderson). * \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough\\" (written and performed by Bryan Ferry over the U.S. print's end credits). A promotional music video (presumably for the U.S. market, where the Tangerine Dream soundtrack was used) was created for the Bryan Ferry song \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough\\". The video, which incorporates Ferry and guitarist David Gilmour into footage from the film, is included as a bonus on disc 2 of the 2002 \\"Ultimate Edition\\" DVD release. Home media In 2002, Universal released the 113-minute Director's Cut on Region 1 DVD, restoring previously cut scenes and the original Goldsmith score. Universal released a Blu-ray version of the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" on May 31, 2011. With the exception of the 2002 DVD-ROM features, this disc carries over all the content from the DVD, including the Jerry Goldsmith-scored \\"Director's Cut\\" and the Tangerine Dream-scored theatrical version. 20th Century Fox - the international rights holder - has released a Blu-ray issue for Region 2 of both the 94-minute European version and the 113-minute Director's Cut, both with Jerry Goldsmith's music.

It may be with or without a handle, generally a small one that may be grasped with the thumb and one or two fingers. It is typically made of a ceramic material. It is usually part of a set, composed of a cup and a matching saucer or a trio that includes a small cake or sandwich plate. These in turn may be part of a tea set in combination with a teapot, cream jug, covered sugar bowl and slop bowl en suite. Teacups are often wider and shorter than coffee cups. Cups for morning tea are conventionally larger than cups for afternoon tea. Better teacups typically are of fine white translucent porcelain and decorated with patterns that may be en suite with extensive dinner services. Some collectors acquire numerous one-of-a-kind cups with matching saucers. Such decorative cabinet cups may be souvenirs of a location, person, or event. Such collectors may also accumulate silver teaspoons with a decorated enamel insert in the handle, with similar themes. In Europe, fine porcelain tea cups made of porcelain (Limoges porcelain from a kaolin base heated in ovens or China porcelain) were a delicacy for enjoying tea time. The cups are made with a handle and are paired with a saucer in a set, they feature hand painted decoration and gold or silver patterns especially lining the rim and the handle. In the culture of China teacups are very small, normally holding no more than 30ml of liquid. They are designed to be used with Yixing teapots or Gaiwan. Countries in the Horn of Africa like Eritrea also use the handleless cups to drink boon which is traditional coffee there. In Russian-speaking cultures and West Asian cultures influenced by the Ottoman Empire tea is often served in a glass held in a separate metal container with a handle, called a zarf. or in Russian a podstakannik. The first small cups specifically made for drinking the beverage tea when it was newly seen in Europe in the 17th century were exported from the Japanese port of Imari or from the Chinese port of Canton. Tea bowls in the Far East did not have handles, and the first European imitations, made at Meissen, were without handles, too. At the turn of the 19th century canns of cylindrical form with handles became a fashionable alternative to bowl-shaped cups. The handle on a teacup was an explicitly German invention in 1707, by Johann Friedrich Bottger, to solve the freshness issue. Unicode codepoints and portray a teacup. is often rendered as a teacup.

Jackson).  Early life  Quinn was born in Albany, New York, the daughter of Nina Pattison, a retirement counselor, and David Quinn, an attorney. She is the stepdaughter of personal finance columnist Jane Bryant Quinn, and has two older brothers and a younger half-brother. Prior to joining MTV, Quinn graduated from Ossining High School in 1977, and NYU in 1981.  MTV  On July 13, 1981, Quinn was working at NYU's Weinstein Dormitory where she answered phones and gave students their toilet paper, mail, and lightbulbs. At the end of her day she decided to stop at WNBC (AM), where she'd just finished up interning for her senior year. Coincidentally, California record company executive Burt Stein also was visiting WNBC. He asked out loud if anyone knew what Bob Pittman was doing. Pittman had been the program director of WNBC a year or so earlier, but had left to start a new venture: a cable channel called MTV (Music Television). WNBC assistant program director Buzz Brindle overheard Stein‚Äôs question and remembered the new venture. He turned to Quinn and suggested that she should try out for a role at the new network as a VJ. Brindle called Pittman and told him about his former intern, Quinn. Pittman told him to get her to the MTV studios immediately, as it was the last day of auditions. Quinn immediately took a cab to Hell's Kitchen for her audition. Brindle's idea had some merit. Quinn had spent much of her time at New York University doing two things: performing in TV commercials (McDonald's first Chicken McNuggets girl, Country Time Lemonade, Clearasil, Campbell's Soup) and working at WNYU-FM, the college radio station. Quinn would later lament that her father and stepmother, financial columnist Jane Bryant Quinn, had spent their money for Martha to spin Peter, Paul, and Mary vinyl as the host of Just Plain Folk. Quinn entered the studio knowing nothing about MTV or what its producers expected of her. She did a four-minute audition where she talked about Earth, Wind, and Fire; MTV executives immediately surrounded her, asking, \\"Who are you? Where did you come from? How old are you?\\" Quinn was stunned, realizing she had just found the perfect job for her talents. Two days later Quinn got the news she was an MTV VJ. Quinn joined Mark Goodman, Nina Blackwood, Alan Hunter and JJ Jackson as original faces and voices of MTV. Being hosts of the nation's first music television network provided them with an in-depth and up-close perspective on the most popular rock/pop music and artists of the 1980s. In 1986, Quinn took part in the then World Wrestling Federation WWE Slammy Awards conducting interviews backstage. Quinn initially left MTV at the end of her contract in late 1986.WESTBROOK, BRUCE. \\"MTV drops Quinn while searching for fresh faces.\\" Houston Chronicle, NO STAR ed., sec.

Indeed, in a 2011 review of I Want My MTV by Craig Marks and Rob Tannenbaum,N.Y. Times, Oct. 26, 2011, p. C8 Dwight Garner recalled: \\"Every sentient straight male in the country developed a schoolboy crush on Martha Quinn, one of the first V.J.'s, fresh out of New York University and so cute she could make your cranium detonate.\\" Musicians Mojo Nixon & Skid Roper recorded a song in 1986 titled \\"Stuffin' Martha's Muffin\\". In the early ‚Äò90s, she also hosted the MTV programs Martha's Greatest Hits, MTV Prime with Martha Quinn, and Rockline. Critics have dubbed Quinn's departure from MTV as \\"the day the video music died.\\" She was also the MTV host at Knebworth 1990.  Acting roles  In 1984, Quinn appeared as herself in an episode of the short-lived sitcom E/R. Quinn played Tympani Charles in Dangerous Curves in 1988. In 1990, she appeared on the short-lived Brady Bunch sequel The Bradys. Quinn played Tracy, who married Bobby Brady (played by Mike Lookinland). She joined Ed McMahon as a co-host for Star Search in 1994. She was a bi-weekly correspondent on The Early Show in 1999. Her film appearances include 1988's Tapeheads; the 1989 film sequel Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives!; 1991's Problem Child 2 as Emily, a hot date that received a shocking introduction from John Ritter's problematic son, Junior; and the 1992 low-budget horror film Bad Channels. She also had a recurring role on Full House. Quinn was featured in a series of commercials for Neutrogena in the mid-1990s.  Career in the 21st century  In 2005, Quinn joined Sirius Satellite Radio network, hosting a one-hour weekly show from her home in Malibu called Martha Quinn Presents: Gods of the Big '80s for the Big '80s channel. After Sirius merged with XM Radio, the channel was rebranded as The 80s on 8, and the show was simply titled \\"Martha Quinn Presents.\\" Quinn joins the other surviving original MTV VJs in hosting programs for The 80s on 8 (10:00 am ‚Äì 1:00 pm). On the September 22, 2005 episode of Comedy Central's new series The Showbiz Show with David Spade, Quinn appeared as herself in mock archival footage (dating back to 1983) from her MTV days. In two separate bumper skits, Quinn sarcastically foretold considerably bizarre behavior from stars Michael Jackson and Sting. Subsequent episodes took shots at Whitney Houston and Tommy Lee. In 2007, Quinn lent her name, face and voice to The '80s Game with Martha Quinn, a PC trivia game developed by Funkitron. The game featured multiple-choice questions about 1980s culture in categories including music, politics, television, sports, movies and celebrities. Quinn was on SiriusXM until 2016 when she left to host mornings for KOSF in San Francisco, owned by Bob Pittman's iHeartMedia. In December 2017, Quinn hosted a show for public television called The 80's (My Music). Personal life Quinn is a vegetarian. In the 1980s, she dated Stiv Bators, frontman for punk band Dead Boys. In 1992, she married musician Jordan Tarlow (ex-Fuzztones). They have two children and live in Malibu, California.

The Anglican Communion Network later developed into the Anglican Church in North America. Goals and structure Its key preoccupation was adhering to traditional, orthodox Christian doctrine in the Anglican Communion on subjects such as the infallibility of Scripture and sexual morality (especially regarding the ordination of non-celibate homosexuals and the blessing of same sex unions), particularly in the United States and Canada. Most of these dioceses and parishes were members of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America (ECUSA), while others were under the jurisdiction of overseas bishops from Uganda, Kenya, Bolivia and other countries. The ACN also included a Forward in Faith convocation of churches, some of which were in the Continuing Anglican Movement. In January 2007, the ACN claimed to have the support of 200,000 laity and 2,200 clergy in ten dioceses and 900 congregations in the United States and Canada. Anglican Communion Network's official website Origins The ACN was officially formed in January 2004 at a conference in Plano, Texas attended by several hundred priests and lay leaders, including 12 Episcopal bishops. Retired Florida Bishop Stephen Hays Jecko was a leader.Brumley, Jeff: \\"Bishop led without losing his humanity\\" Florida Times-Union, June 9, 2007 Its main intent was to provide a system to supply theologically conservative leadership and church oversight to Anglicans in the United States and Canada. The ACN was formed in response to suggestions by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Rowan Williams, in the wake of the controversy regarding Anglican views of homosexuality. In the United States the initial controversy was the 2003 consecration of Gene Robinson as bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire. At the time of his election, Robinson was openly living with a same-sex partner. Some issues date back to the adoption of 1979 Book of Common Prayer. Further controversy followed the election of Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori. Statements made by Schori, such as \\"Our mother Jesus gives birth to a new creation\\", have also been disputed. In Canada the main trigger was the approval of the blessing of same-sex unions by the Diocese of Westminster, also in 2003. Most of the work in establishing the ACN was performed by the American Anglican Council, a group of theologically- conservative congregations within the Episcopal Church. The first ACN Moderator was Robert Duncan, seventh bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh (Episcopal Church), and first Archbishop of the Anglican Church in North America. Anglican Relief and Development Fund The Anglican Relief and Development Fund (ARDF) was created by the ACN in 2004 to be a support and humanitarian organisation working with Anglicans in the Global South. The ARDF works on multiple Millennium Development Goals projects throughout Africa, South America, and the Middle East. ARDF is supported by the Church of Nigeria, the Anglican Church of Kenya, the Province of South East Asia, the Church in the Province of the West Indies, and the Church of the Province of West Africa. In 2005 over $1.4 million was donated from ARDF. Youth and children Youth ministers from Network Dioceses gathered in Charlotte, North Carolina prior to the November 2006 National Youthworker's Convention hosted by Youth Specialties. During this meeting, speakers inspired participants to get back to the basics of faith, including instructing youth and children in Biblical literacy. Jack Gabig was the director of youth and children for the network. Network dioceses These are the dioceses of the Episcopal Church that were part of ACN from the beginning: *Diocese of Albany (N.Y.) *Diocese of Central Florida *Diocese of Pittsburgh *Diocese of Quincy (Ill.) *Diocese of Rio Grande (Texas) *Diocese of Springfield (Ill.) *Diocese of Fort Worth (Texas) *Diocese of South Carolina *Diocese of Dallas *Diocese of San Joaquin (Calif.) Subsequently, the conventions of the dioceses of San Joaquin, Pittsburgh, Quincy, and Fort Worth voted to leave the Episcopal Church. The departing members joined the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone and it is those dioceses which participated in the Network. The members of those dioceses that remained in TEC did not indicated an interest in remaining a part of the Network. Support from Anglican churches and ministries The Common Cause Partnership, founded in June 2004, is an alliance of several churches and ministries which support ACN. The initial meeting was followed by a gathering in February 2005 which resulted in a Statement of Common Cause Partners in North America. The Common Cause Partners are as follows: *American Anglican Council *Anglican Coalition in Canada *Anglican Mission in America *Anglican Network in Canada *Anglican Province of America *Convocation of Anglicans in North America *Forward in Faith North America *Reformed Episcopal Church Ecumenical relations In a 2005 meeting, the ACN requested that its moderator send a letter to Pope Benedict XVI in order to express its greetings and support for upholding the historic teaching and faith of the Church.Bedford, TX : Anglican Communion Network Council Communiqu√© See also *Anglican realignment *Anglican Communion *Anglican Coalition in Canada *Anglican Mission in America *Anglican Network in Canada *Anglican views of homosexuality *Confessing Movement *Continuing Anglican Movement References *Following the Money, article by Jim Naughton.

Scott Frandsen (born July 21, 1980 in Kelowna, British Columbia) is a Canadian rower of Swedish and Danish descent. Biography Born in Kelowna, British Columbia, he began rowing at age 16 at Brentwood College (High School), in British Columbia, Canada. He rowed for four years at the University of California, Berkeley. His freshman boat in 1999, coached by Craig Amerkhanian finished second at the Intercollegiate Rowing Association championship, which serves as the national championship race for men's collegiate rowing in the United States. In 2000, 2001, and 2002, he was in the varsity eight man boat, which won the IRA championship each year. In 2000 and 2001, his boats were undefeated and are considered by many as the fastest collegiate boats ever. In 2003, he went to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, for graduate work. There he rowed for the University in the Oxford Blue Boat against rivals Cambridge in The Boat Race. Despite their diminutive stature his Oxford crew won a dramatic race by the smallest ever recorded margin (one foot), and in so winning, they overturned the biggest weight deficit in the history of the contest. They achieved this by over-rating and out-racing their heavier Cambridge counterparts on the outside of the long Surrey bend through the middle of the race. This took considerable guts and fortitude, and the attitude the crew exemplified in doing so was reflective of Frandsen's natural tenacity and stubbornness. Commentators cite this tenacity as the main factor allowing the Oxford crew to upset the much bigger, more powerful and more experienced 2003 Cambridge boat. Frandsen went on to row that summer with one of his Cambridge rivals from the 2003 Boat Race, Wayne Pommen, at the 2003 World Rowing Championships in Milan. The Boat Race pairing took sixth place for Canada in a hotly contested final of the coxless pairs event. The following year Frandsen pursued selection for the 2004 Athens Olympics. He won two gold medals on the 2004 World Cup circuit, both in the Men's Eight event (in Munich, Germany and in Lucerne, Switzerland). At the 2004 Summer Olympics he was in the Canadian Men's Eight (M8+) which was the favourite for the event. His boat narrowly lost out to the Americans in the Heat, with both crews going under the previous World Record time. Come the Final the Canadians had a disappointing row and finished out of the medals in fifth place. In 2005, Frandsen was again in the Canadian Men's Eight. This time, his boat finished seventh at the World Championships held in Gifu-Nagaragawa, Japan. After a frustrating couple of years in the Canadian National Team system, at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China Scott won a silver medal in the Men's coxless pairs with Dave Calder. It was Canada's first medal of the Games. Terry Paul coached them for the event. He and David Calder teamed again at the 2012 Summer Olympics, finishing 6th in the final.

The screenplay was by Cy Endfield, from his book, and Anthony Storey. The film was directed by Douglas Hickox. The score was composed by Elmer Bernstein. Zulu Dawn is a prequel to Zulu, released in 1964, which depicts the historical Battle of Rorke's Drift later the same day, and which was co-written and directed by Cy Endfield. Plot The film is set in British South Africa, in the province of Natal, in January 1879. The first act of the film revolves around the administrators and officials of Cape Colony, notably the supremely arrogant Lord Chelmsford and the scheming Sir Henry Bartle Frere, who both wish to crush the neighbouring Zulu Empire, which is perceived as a threat to Cape Colony's emerging industrial economy. Bartle Frere issues an impossible ultimatum to the Zulu king, Cetshwayo, demanding that he dissolve the Zulu Empire. Cetshwayo refuses, providing Cape Colony with a pretext to invade Zululand. Despite objections from leading members of Cape Colony's high society and from Great Britain itself, Bartle Frere authorises Lord Chelmsford to lead a British invasion force into Zululand. The rest of the film focuses on the British invasion of Zululand and the lead-up to the Battle of Isandlwana. The invading British army, laden with an immense network of supply wagons, invades Zululand and marches in the direction of Ulundi, the Zulu capital. British forces, eager to fight a large battle in which they can unleash their cutting-edge military technology against the vast Zulu army, become increasingly frustrated as the main Zulu army refuses to attack the British, and fighting is restricted to a few small skirmishes between British and Zulu scouts. Concerned that their supply lines are becoming overstretched and that the main Zulu army is still at large, British troops begin torturing captive Zulu warriors in an effort to learn the location and tactics of the Zulu army. Halfway to Ulundi, Chelmsford halts his army at the base of Mount Isandhlwana, ignoring the advice of Boer attendants to entrench the camp and laager the supply wagons, leaving the camp dangerously exposed. During the night, Colonel Durnford and an escort of fifty mounted Basutos approach the camp. Lord Chelmsford then orders Durnford to return to his unit, bringing them to the camp immediately to reinforce Colonel Pulleine. Lt. Vereker should join Durnford as aide-de-camp. Reacting to false intelligence, Chelmsford leads half of the British army, including the best infantry, cavalry and artillery units, on a wild goose chase far from the camp, in pursuit of a phantom Zulu army. On the day of battle, Durnford and his troops arrive at 11:00 a.m. at the camp at Isandlwana. Meanwhile, the Zulu captives escape from their torturers and regroup with the Zulu army, informing them of the British army's direction and strength. After having lunch with Colonel Pulleine and Lt. Vereker, Durnford quickly decides to send Vereker to scout the hills. Durnford then decides to take his own command out from the camp too, and scout the iNyoni heights. The entire Zulu army is later discovered by men of Lt. Vereker's troop of scouts. Chasing a number of Zulu herdsmen trying to hurry away their cattle, they discover the main Zulu enemy force of thousands at the bottom of a valley. Lt. Vereker sends Lt. Raw to warn the camp that it is about to be attacked. As Zulu impis descend upon the camp, Durnford's cavalry retreat to a donga in an effort to hold back the Zulu advance. Forced back, the British take heavy casualties, including the battery of Hale rockets, which is overrun by the Zulus. Initially, the British infantry succeed in defending the camp, and Zulu forces retreat under a hail of artillery fire. British units defending the camp are now becoming dangerously spread-out, and are oblivious to Zulu forces moving round the sides of the mountain in an encircling move. As British infantrymen begin to run out of ammunition due to the Quartermaster's incompetent distribution and the British cavalry are driven back towards the camp, Zulu warriors charge the British troops en masse, sustaining horrific casualties, but succeed in breaking the British lines. As British troops break and flee towards the camp, the battle breaks down into hand-to-hand fighting between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, amongst the d√©bris of tents, fallen soldiers and supply wagons. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of Zulu warriors, British soldiers and their Afrikaner allies are slaughtered in the camp, some being cut down as they attempt to flee towards Natal. During the last minutes of the battle, the camp's commander, Colonel Pulleine, entrusts the Queen's Colours of the 2nd battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot to two junior officers, Lts. Melvill and Coghill, who attempt to carry them to safety in Natal, passing gruesome scenes as Zulu warriors hunt down British and Afrikaner infantrymen attempting to flee across the river. Pulleine was speared in his tent during the skirmish. While crossing the Buffalo River, the three lieutenants are cut down by Zulus and the Colours (a Union Flag embroidered with the Regiment's insignia) are captured. Lying wounded, perhaps mortally, Vereker shoots and kills the Zulu wielding the Colours, and the Colours fall gracefully into the river, where they are carried out of reach. In the evening, Chelmsford and the rest of the British army return to Isandlwana, to be greeted by the sight of their slaughtered comrades, and the news that a mass Zulu army has invaded Natal and laid siege to Rorke's Drift. The film ends with Zulu warriors in a silhouetted victory procession, dragging captured British artillery back to Ulundi. Cast =British= * Peter O'Toole as Lt. General Lord Chelmsford. The arrogant commander of British forces in South Africa, Chelmsford is eager to advance his military career by crushing neighbouring Zululand, believing that \\"for the savage as for the child, chastisement is sometimes a blessing\\". During the invasion, Chelmsford refuses to listen to advice from his British and Boer advisers, and from the comfort of his tent and personal coach, authorises his troops to torture Zulu captives. On the day of the battle, Chelmsford commits a cardinal error in splitting his forces. While the troops at Isandlwana fight for their lives, Chelmsford and his equally arrogant officers, a few miles away, enjoy a silver-service luncheon. Chelmsford is last seen arriving at the site of the battle several hours later, mortified by the defeat of his soldiers, absorbing the news that the victorious Zulu army has invaded Natal. Chelmsford's arrogance was mixed with incompetence as he left unclear instructions to those left behind at Isandlwana including which officer was in charge, Durnford or Pulleine. Chelmsford would later lay the blame for the disaster on Colonel Durnford. * Burt Lancaster as Colonel Anthony Durnford. Commander of a large force of the Natal Native Contingent (NNC), Britain's African allies, Durnford is a humane officer who expresses concern for the lives and welfare of his African troops. When war breaks out, Durnford, much to his chagrin, is ordered to remain in Natal and defend the border rather than accompany the invasion force. His troops are ultimately called to reinforce the invasion army, and on the day of battle, Durnford and his African cavalrymen are driven into the camp at Isandlwana. As the British forces break apart, the one-armed Durnford becomes trapped in the camp. Hoping to save his men, Durnford orders his African cavalrymen to retreat. Remaining on foot at the battlefield, Durnford is killed alongside his infantrymen. Durnford would later be painted by Chelmsford as the scape-goat for the disaster. * Denholm Elliott as Colonel Henry Pulleine. A mild-mannered man, Pulleine is a military bureaucrat who accompanies the army into Zululand, and finds himself left in command of the camp at Isandlwana after Chelmsford leaves on a sortie. News of the approaching Zulu army unnerves Pulleine, and his overstretched troops are unable to defend the camp. After having entrusted the Union Flag to Lts. Melvill and Coghill, Pulleine returns to his tent to pen a last letter to his wife. He is discovered by an escaped Zulu prisoner and, unwilling to shoot the young soldier, the elderly Pulleine is killed in his tent. * James Faulkner as Lieutenant Teignmouth Melvill. Portrayed as an arrogant and overconfident man, when a lone Zulu warrior calls from the mountain asking why British forces are invading, Melvill replies, \\"we come here by the order of the great Queen Victoria, Queen of all Africa!\\" Towards the end of the battle, Melvill carries the Queen's Colours back towards Natal, bypassing British infantrymen being killed as they flee towards the river. Melvill reaches the river border between Zululand and Natal, but is speared by Zulu warriors while defending the flag. * Christopher Cazenove as Lieutenant Coghill. A polite and humorous young officer, Coghill is temporarily attached to Colonel Pulleine's staff, due to an injured leg which requires him to ride on horseback. Coghill has a close friendship with Lt. Melvill, and during the invasion he expresses dissatisfaction at Chelmsford's strategy. Towards the end of the battle, Coghill accompanies Melvill in his attempt to escort the Queen's Colours back to Natal. When Melvill nearly drowns while trying to cross the Buffalo River, Coghill turns to help him, but they are ambushed by Zulu warriors. Coghill tries to defend the flag with his revolver, but is killed. * Simon Ward as Lt. William Vereker. A young officer who has recently attached to Durnford's command, Vereker is a light-hearted cavalry officer eager to see war. Vereker's enthusiasm, though, evaporates as he sees Zulu warriors tortured and slain by British troops. Vereker and his men discover the main Zulu army on the morning of the battle, and as British lines collapse, Vereker accompanies Lts. Melvill and Coghill in an effort to return the Queen's Colours to Natal. Zulu warriors attack and kill Melvill and Coghill, and seize the Colours. Vereker, despite his injuries, takes aim with his rifle and shoots the Zulu wielding the Colours, ensuring that they fall into the Buffalo River, where they float downstream. Vereker's fate remains unknown. * Bob Hoskins as Colour Sergeant Williams. The loud, aggressive Williams, a high-ranking NCO, is both feared and respected by his troops, but displays genuine concern, taking the young Private Williams under his wing. During the battle, Williams loses many of his infantrymen during hand-to-hand fighting, and is injured while defending a group of unarmed artillerymen. Williams is stabbed in the back while attempting to rescue Private Williams, and having killed several warriors with his bayonet, dies amid a large wave of Zulus. * Peter Vaughan as Quartermaster Bloomfield. An elderly and jovial war veteran who claims, somewhat dubiously, to have been the bugler for the Duke of Wellington. Bloomfield is a military administrator responsible for overseeing the invasion force's supply network. Bloomfield takes a young bugler, Boy Pullen (Phil Daniels) under his wing, but his compassion does not extend to the NNC's black soldiers, whom he sees as little more than savage animals. During the battle, Bloomfield refuses to bypass regulations requiring that ammunition be dispensed in small, properly recorded quantities, causing an ammunition shortage that forces British troops to retreat. Bloomfield is injured when his ammunition wagon explodes, which kills Boy Pullen, and is himself killed when a Zulu warrior impales him from behind. * Michael Jayston as Colonel Crealock. An officer of the Royal Artillery and lickspittle to his commander, Colonel Crealock acts as Lord Chelmsford's secretary, constantly expressing his agreement with Chelmsford's decisions. He accompanies Chelmsford's expedition away from Isandhlwana, and is seen idly sketching the landscape. When questioned by Newman on the logic of splitting the British army, Crealock acidly replies that the Zulus' primitive weaponry does not pose any real threat. When Lieutenant Harford relays news from Isandhlwana with an urgent request for reinforcements, Crealock lectures Harford on military etiquette, and does nothing to facilitate the request. Crealock is last seen with Chelmsford after returning to the devastated camp, bringing news of an ongoing battle at Rorke's Drift and a Zulu invasion of Natal. * Ronald Pickup as Lieutenant Harford. A well-meaning officer of the NNC, Harford distinguishes himself from his colleagues through his concern for his African soldiers, and is appalled by his superior's lack of concern for the lives of native workers, and by Chelmsford's casual attitude to the torture of Zulu captives. On the day of the battle, Harford accompanies Chelmsford's column. During the early stages of the battle, a rider dispatched by Colonel Pulleine to catch up with Chelmsford's army brings an urgent request for reinforcements. His message is ignored, and Harford is denied permission to return to Isandhlwana. He is last seen in the evening, weeping at the bodies of young soldiers. * Ronald Lacey as Norris \\"Noggs\\" Newman. A war correspondent for The Standard, Norris-Newman accompanies the army into Zululand to report on the war. Newman is deeply critical of Chelmsford, frequently pointing out his tactical errors, making no effort to conceal his contempt for the general. Newman appears to have more knowledge of the Zulus than the officers, and expresses sympathy for the tribe, who stand little chance against Western warfare. Newman accompanies Chelmsford's expedition and is last seen with Chelmsford, staring at the devastation of the battlefield. * John Mills as Sir Henry Bartle Frere. The British High Commissioner for South Africa who provokes the war by issuing King Cetshwayo with an impossible ultimatum. Viewing the Zulus as savage barbarians, Bartle Frere believes that the war will provide \\"a final solution to the Zulu problem.\\" Frere is last seen on the night of the British invasion, and is not seen again after this. =Zulu= * Simon Sabela as King Cetshwayo. King of Zululand, Cetshwayo is depicted as a peaceful and effective ruler, eager to avoid war but unwilling to compromise Zululand's security by agreeing to Bartle Frere's ultimatum. Cetshwayo is concerned that mobilising his armies will leave a chronic labour shortage, and is eager to defeat the British army in time for his soldiers to return and gather the harvest. Cetshwayo is last seen in his kraal at Ulundi, reluctantly announcing a state of war between Zululand and Cape Colony. * Ken Gampu as Mantshonga. A Zulu regarded as a traitor by Cetshwayo because of his support for a rival claimant to the Zulu throne, Mantshonga delivers the British ultimatum to Cetshwayo and returns his response. * Abe Temba as Uhama. A leading general and strongman in the Zulu army, Uhama masterminds various schemes to confuse British forces, using scouts to gain intelligence on the British army, and small raiding parties to confuse their scouts on the whereabouts of Zulu impis. Uhama realises he must overwhelm the British while they are exposed and vulnerable; and that an open battle would result in a crushing Zulu defeat. He keeps his impis hidden, allowing the invaders to progress deep into Zululand, waiting for them to commit an error that will give the impis the opportunity to overwhelm the British before they have time to commit their technology to the battle. While chasing a Boer scout, Uhama instructs three of his warriors to allow themselves to be captured by the British, who eventually escape and advise Uhama on British weaknesses. In contrast to the British commanders, Uhama displays immense bravery, and is last seen leading his warriors into the d√©b√¢cle of the British camp, where he is shot and presumably killed. * Gilbert Tiabane as Bayele. The son of King Cetshwayo, he leads several scouting missions to gain intelligence on British forces. Under orders from Uhama, Bayele allows himself to be captured by cavalrymen of the NNC, and with two other warriors, is taken to the camp at Isandhlwana. While lashed to wagon wheels, Bayele and his two comrades are beaten but only reveal false information. Bayele later uses a distraction in the camp to kill the sentry guarding them and release his two comrades, and the three escape and return to Uhama. Bayele takes part in the assault on the camp, and by chance finds himself face-to-face with Colonel Pulleine in the command tent. Pulleine, recognising Bayele as the tortured prisoner, is unwilling to shoot the young soldier, and Bayele seizes the opportunity to kill him. Production The script was originally written by Cy Endfield. The Lamitas Property Investment Corporation raised money for the film. They financed a series of films, including several in South Africa, such as The Wild Geese (1978). The company committed about ¬£5 million to Zulu Dawn, most of it raised from a Swiss bank, the Banque de Paris et des Pay Bas. HBO helped guarantee finance. The budget was initially set at $6.5 million but the budget kept increasing and eventually cost $11.75 million, despite coming in only two days over schedule. Jake Eberts was involved in raising finance for the film. He had to guarantee Burt Lancaster's salary when Lancaster's agent insisted on one. This meant Eberts was liable for the loan. In 1983 the interest made this ¬£450,000. Eberts spent years paying it back. John Hurt was cast in a lead role but was refused entry to South Africa. This confused Hurt who was not particularly political. It was thought South African Intelligence may have confused him with the actor John Hurd, who was a draft dodger. Orion Pictures picked the film up for worldwide distribution through Warner Bros. and other companies. =Shooting= Every day over 1,000 people were involved in filming, with Zulu extras being paid ¬£2.70 per day. In 1978, the producers and financiers agreed to defer their fees and no completion guarantee was in place to get the film finished. Norma Foster was a liaison between the South African government (notably the Minister of Information, Dr Connie Mulder) and the filmmakers; she later claimed the producers owed her ¬£20,000. Co-producers, James Faulkner and Barrie Saint Clair, claimed they were owed ¬£100,000 in deferred fees. Over 100 creditors in South Africa claimed they were owed ¬£250,000. Faulkner and Saint Clair sought an injunction to block screening of the film until they were paid. Lamitas denied liability for the money, claiming expenses exceeded the agreed budget and the injunction was lifted May 21, 1979. They later offered to settle for 25 pence in the pound. Reception Despite the success of Zulu, the prequel was not well received and did not fare particularly well at the box office.

In 2005 Kreek took the summer off to get married and spend time with his wife. Kreek coached at Stanford Rowing Center in 2006 and 2007 for the Junior Crew. Athletic career He won the gold medal at the 2002, 2003 and 2007 world championships for Canada's men's eight team in Seville, Spain, Milan, Italy and Munich, Germany respectively. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Kreek competed with the Canadian men's eight, who were widely expected to win a medal but ultimately finished in fifth place. He won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in the men's eights with Andrew Byrnes, Kyle Hamilton, Malcolm Howard, Kevin Light, Ben Rutledge, Dominic Seiterle, Jake Wetzel and cox Brian Price. Kreek's singing of O Canada at the medal ceremony was cited as an inspiration by Simon Whitfield, who won a silver medal in the triathlon. Whitfield wrote \\"Sing like Adam Kreek\\" on the handlebars of his bicycle and repeated \\"Sing like Kreek\\" to himself near the end of the race. In 2013 Kreek set off with three other rowers, Markus Pukonen, Jordan Hanssen and Pat Fleming to attempt the first-ever row from mainland Africa to North America, recording it for classroom lessons in schools across the United States and Canada. 73 days into the 6,700-kilometre transatlantic rowing expedition the boat capsized in the Bermuda Triangle. The crew called for help through a personal locator beacon attached to a life-jacket and were successfully located and rescued. The expedition was sponsored by the Canadian Wildlife Federation and Ocean Adventure, Rowing and Education (OAR Northwest). A computer program developed at the University of Victoria monitored the crew's activities and ensured they followed a strict schedule that maximized their energy and mental sharpness. There was also scientific equipment on board to monitor the ocean conditions and marine life.

He is a graduate of the University of Alberta. He won the gold medal at both the 2003 and 2002 world championships for Canada's men's eight team in Milan, Italy and Seville, Spain respectively. Hoskins comes from a long line of rowers on his mother's side: He is the grandson of Ted Lindstrom; the nephew of Olympian David Lindstrom (Montreal 1976), and the cousin of Olympian George Keys (Seoul 1988). Hoskins began rowing at the Edmonton Rowing Club as a form of physical therapy to recondition his shoulder shortly after recovering in 1996. Just two years later, in 1998, Hoskins won gold at Royal Canadian Henley in the Intermediate Single and Senior Single. Hoskins tried out for and made the Canadian rowing team later that year. For the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, he was a member of the Spares Club along with celebrated lightweights Ben Storey and Edward Winchester. After a coaching purge in Canadian rowing, 2001 marked the arrival of Mike Spracklen as head coach of the men's program. Under Spracklen, Hoskins served as the captain of the men's program when the 8+ won a gold medal at both the 2002 and 2003 world championships in Spain and Italy respectively. Although favoured to win gold in Athens in 2004, the 8+ finished in a disappointing fifth place, well behind the USA boat, their arch-rivals leading up to the Games.Olympic results Hoskins continued to row the following year after the Olympics, and retired in 2005 and finished his Environmental Science degree from the University of Alberta in 2006. He has been busy earning his certification as an environmental geologist and parenting his three young children.

The concept retains a sense of generality, aimed at understanding and improving design processes and practices quite broadly, rather than developing domain-specific knowledge within any professional field of design.  Origins  Design research emerged as a recognisable field of study in the 1960s, initially marked by a conference on Design methodsJones, J C and D G Thornley (eds) (1963) Conference on Design Methods, Oxford, UK: Pergamon Press at Imperial College London, in 1962. It led to the founding of the Design Research Society (DRS) in 1966. John Christopher Jones (one of the initiators of the 1962 conference) founded a postgraduate Design Research Laboratory at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, and L. Bruce Archer supported by Misha Black founded the postgraduate Department of Design Research at the Royal College of Art, London, becoming the first Professor of Design Research.DRS2016 Online Exhibition http://www.drs2016.org/exhibition/#ddr1 The Design Research Society has always stated its aim as: ‚Äòto promote the study of and research into the process of designing in all its many fields‚Äô. Its purpose therefore is to act as a form of learned society, taking a scholarly and domain independent view of the process of designing. Some of the origins of design methods and design research lay in the emergence after the 2nd World War of operational research methods and management decision-making techniques, the development of creativity techniques in the 1950s, and the beginnings of computer programs for problem solving in the 1960s. A statement by Bruce Archer encapsulated what was going on: ‚ÄòThe most fundamental challenge to conventional ideas on design has been the growing advocacy of systematic methods of problem solving, borrowed from computer techniques and management theory, for the assessment of design problems and the development of design solutions.‚Äô Herbert A. Simon established the foundations for ‚Äòa science of design‚Äô, which would be ‚Äòa body of intellectually tough, analytic, partly formalizable, partly empirical, teachable doctrine about the design process.‚Äô Early work Early work was mainly within the domains of architecture and industrial design, but research in engineering design developed strongly in the 1980s; for example, through ICED--the series of International Conferences on Engineering Design, now run by The Design Society. These developments were especially strong in Germany and Japan. In the USA there were also some important developments in design theory and methodology, including the publications of the Design Methods Group and the series of conferences of the Environmental Design Research Association. The National Science Foundation initiative on design theory and methods led to substantial growth in engineering design research in the late-1980s. A particularly significant development was the emergence of the first journals of design research. DRS initiated Design Studies in 1979, Design Issues appeared in 1984, and Research in Engineering Design in 1989.  Development  The development of design research has led to the establishment of design as a coherent discipline of study in its own right, based on the view that design has its own things to know and its own ways of knowing them. Bruce Archer again encapsulated the view in stating his new belief that ‚Äòthere exists a designerly way of thinking and communicating that is both different from scientific and scholarly ways of thinking and communicating, and as powerful as scientific and scholarly methods of enquiry when applied to its own kinds of problems‚Äô. This view was developed further in a series of papers by Nigel Cross, collected as a book on 'Designerly Ways of Knowing'. Significantly, Donald Sch√∂n promoted the new view within his book The Reflective Practitioner, in which he challenged the technical rationality of Simon and sought to establish ‚Äòan epistemology of practice implicit in the artistic, intuitive processes which [design and other] practitioners bring to situations of uncertainty, instability, uniqueness and value conflict‚Äô. Design research ‚Äòcame of age‚Äô in the 1980s, and has continued to expand. This was helped by the development of a research base, including doctoral programmes, within many of the design schools located within new institutions that were previously art colleges, and the emergence of new areas such as interaction design. More new journals have appeared, such as The Design Journal, the Journal of Design Research, CoDesign and more recently Design Science. There has also been a major growth in conferences, with not only a continuing series by DRS, but also series such as Design Thinking, Doctoral Education in Design, Design Computing and Cognition, Design and Emotion, the European Academy, the Asian Design Conferences, etc. Design research now operates on an international scale, acknowledged in the cooperation of DRS with the Asian design research societies in the founding in 2005 of the International Association of Societies of Design Research.

It was one of the largest known impact events to have happened in North America.\\"The Manson impact was the biggest thing that has ever occurred on the mainland United States. Of any type. Ever,\\" Bill Bryson, A Short History of Nearly Everything 2003:238. Previously it was thought to have led to the extinction of the dinosaurs until isotopic ages proved that it was too old.  Description  No surface evidence exists due to comparatively recent coverage by glacial till, and the site where the crater lies buried is now a flat landscape. But, hidden about below the surface is a buried structure about in diameter. It lies under the southeast corner of Pocahontas County and extends under portions of three adjoining counties. That an anomalous structure underlaid the area was known from unusual water well drill cuttings in 1912 of deformed rock, \\"crystalline clast breccia with a melt matrix\\" as a later report described it.Koeberl and Anderson 1996. A research investigation was started in 1955, and it was labeled a \\"cryptovolcanic structure\\" (a hypothetical volcanic steam explosion). Further investigation was undertaken by Robert S. Dietz who proposed an impact origin in 1959 and by Nicholas Short in 1966 who produced evidence of shocked quartz grains which confirmed the impact origin of the structure. In 1991 and 1992 the U.S. Geological Survey along with others including the Iowa Geological Survey conducted detailed research in part to test the possible connection of the Manson Crater with the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. The / isotope ratio dating of the core from the impact structure gave an age of about 74 Ma, or about 10 Ma older than the K‚ÄìT boundary. The impactor is considered to have been a stony meteorite about in diameter. The site at the time was the shore of a shallow inland seaBryson 2002:237. the Western Interior Seaway. The impact disrupted granite, gneiss, and shales of the Precambrian basement as well as sedimentary formations of Paleozoic age, Devonian through Cretaceous. Limestone layers that give the rest of Iowa hard water were instantaneously vaporized down to the basement rocks, giving Manson the anomalous soft water that it has today.Bryson 2002:237.

After having lived in Ottawa after the Athens Olympics for two years, and Robbi becoming a Registered Massage Therapist, they moved back to Victoria in March 2007 so that Brian could train at the Victoria Training Centre full-time. They now reside in Orangeville, ON. Robbi has given birth to two girls, Brianna Helen on May 31, 2007 and most recently their second daughter, Peyton Victoria on January 12, 2010. Price is now an Olympic Gold Medallist after dominating the field at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing China. He won the Men's Eight with team mates Kevin Light, Ben Rutledge, Andrew Byrnes, Jake Wetzel, Malcolm Howard, Dominic Sieterle, Adam Kreek and Kyle Hamilton Great Britain won the silver while USA finished with Bronze. The Canadian boat stormed out to a lead right from the start with GB and the USA unable to match their immense power. Price decided to take two years away from rowing (2009, 2010) and enjoyed a successful career in the speaking industry. His motivational story of Cancer survival to Olympic Champion resonated with everyone from corporate audiences to elementary schools. As much as he enjoyed speaking, he was drawn back to rowing by a young and motivated group of guys on the Canadian National Team. With Mike Spracklen still at the helm of the Heavy Men's Eight, it was the obvious choice to return to the Eight with the aim of defending gold in London 2012. With 2011 being his first World Championships back in the boat, it proved to be successful one with improvements coming throughout the season. Canada finished 5th at the prestigious Lucerne World Cup Regatta and improved even more with a Bronze medal at the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled Slovenia. This finish qualified them for the 2012 Olympics (top 7 qualified) and solidified them a legitimate contenders heading into the games. He won a silver medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the men's eight. His teammates included Malcolm Howard and Andrew Byrnes, with whom he won gold in 2008.

A combine car in North American parlance, most often referred to simply as a combine, is a type of railroad car which combines sections for both passengers and freight. Most often, it was used on short lines to carry passengers and their luggage, as a full car would not have been cost effective. One half (or less) of the car is built like a baggage car while the other half of the car is a regular passenger car. This type of combine is referred to as a coach-baggage. Another common type of combine in railroad use was the coach-RPO. A portion of this type of car was configured as a railway post office while the rest of the car was configured as a coach. The New York, New Haven & Hartford railroad operated a combine separated into an RPO and a smoking section. In 1893, Pullman produced a combine with a baggage area, buffet, barber shop, bathroom with tub and a smoking section featuring a fireplace. When Amtrak took over in 1971, lightweight combines were used on most routes, particularly on trains that had used combines before Amtrak took over. As Amtrak started rehabbing their older cars to Heritage Fleet standards, the only combines which survived were the Baggage-Dorm cars. As Amtrak received the Superliner cars in all forms, including dorm cars, the only routes which required rehabbed single-level dorm cars were the East Coast routes (Crescent, Lake Shore Limited, Silver Star, etc.) due to low tunnel clearance. Because Amtrak had a surplus of single-level coaches due to the recent delivery of Amfleet coaches, baggage-coaches were unnecessary. Thus, baggage-dorm cars were the only cars that should logically be rehabbed. Rehabbed baggage-dorm cars were used on Amtrak East Coast routes from the early 1980s until 1996. When Amtrak received its new Viewliner and Superliner II sleeping cars in 1996, some of the Heritage 10-6 sleepers were turned into crew dorms, and the dorms became unnecessary. When Amtrak received the Superliner II coaches, some of the Heritage coaches which had been replaced were turned into baggage cars. Thus, baggage-dorms became unnecessary, and all were retired. The Viewliner II orders included 10 baggage-dorms and 4 are currently in service on the Crescent route. Although Amtrak operates many cars in its Superliner fleet that are labeled as coach-baggage, they are not often referred to as combines. Via Rail Canada still operates a few combines in the traditional sense, which carry passengers, baggage and supplies for villages en route. They are towed by freight trains in far northern Manitoba.

History  The title of the book refers to a quote that Capote chose as an epigraph: \\"More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones\\". The quote is attributed to Saint Teresa of √Åvila, although there is no evidence that it is authentic. According to Joseph M. Fox's editor's note to the 1987 edition, Capote signed the initial contract for the novel‚Äîenvisioned as a contemporary American analog to Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time‚Äîon January 5, 1966, with Random House. This agreement provided a $25,000 advance with a stipulated delivery date of January 1, 1968.Capote Truman: Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel, page xi. Random House, 1987 Distracted by the unprecedented success of his \\"nonfiction novel\\" In Cold Blood amid the gestation of the Black and White Ball (a party thrown by Capote in honor of Katharine Graham at the Plaza Hotel in November 1966), various television projects, short pieces and increasing personal demons, Capote missed his 1968 deadline. In July 1969, the superannuated 1966 contract was renegotiated, granting a \\"substantially larger\\" $750,000 advance in exchange for a trilogy to be delivered in January 1973.Capote Truman: Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel, page xii. Random House, 1987The Self- Destructive Spiral of Truman Capote After Answered Prayers  Vanity Fair The delivery date was further delayed to January 1974 and then September 1977. A final agreement in early 1980 would have yielded Capote $1 million to have been paid only if he submitted the manuscript by March 1, 1981. This final deadline was not kept.Capote, Truman: Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel, page xiii. Random House, 1987 In May 1971, on The Dick Cavett Show, Capote referred to the book as his \\"posthumous novel\\", explaining, \\"either I'm going to kill it, or it's going to kill me\\". The book is a somewhat sordid tale of the mixing of high and low social classes, drawn from his experiences as best friend and confidant to the most prominent female socialites of the era and their husbands. The first chapter of Answered Prayers, \\"Unspoiled Monsters\\", chronicles the \\"picaresque\\" exploits of P.B. Jones, a young writer (enmeshed in the process of writing a novel, Answered Prayers) and \\"bisexual hustler\\" who \\"beds men and women alike if they can further his literary career\\" in the 1940s New York literary milieu; accordingly, both Katherine Anne Porter and Tennessee Williams are depicted in a vituperative light. Jones (who later appears as the main interlocutor in \\"La Cote Basque\\") is believed to be a composite of Capote, Perry Smith from In Cold Blood, and Capote's late friend Denham Fouts. The eponymous protagonist of the comparatively obfuscatory chapter \\"Kate McCloud\\" (and the ostensible heroine of the novel) was inspired by Mona von Bismarck, the eldest of Capote's society friends.The New York Times: Book Review Search Article By 1975, Capote's increasingly outrageous public behavior‚Äîfueled by alcohol, drugs and sexual indiscretion‚Äîled many to believe that he had no intention of ever publishing Answered Prayers and had essentially given up writing to follow in the footsteps of his fabulous friends as a professional socialite. To prove that he was still a viable and productive writer, Capote sold four chapters (\\"Mojave\\", \\"La Cote Basque\\", \\"Unspoiled Monsters\\", and \\"Kate McCloud\\") of the novel-in-progress to Esquire at the behest of Gordon Lish in 1975 and 1976. \\"Mojave\\" was published in the magazine's June 1975 issue to little fanfare. However, with the publication of \\"La Cote Basque\\" in the November 1975 issue, there was an uproar of shock and anger among Capote's friends and acquaintances, who recognized thinly veiled characters based on themselves. Both \\"Mojave\\" and \\"La Cote Basque\\" were expos√©s of the dysfunctional personal lives led by the author's social benefactors, including CBS head William S. Paley, his wife Babe (then terminally ill with cancer), Gloria Vanderbilt (depicted as being insufferably vacuous), Happy Rockefeller, and Ann Woodward. The Paleys would never socialize with Capote again and led an exodus of ostracizing friends. Subsequently, \\"Unspoiled Monsters\\" and \\"Kate McCloud\\" were published in the periodical in May 1976 and December 1976, respectively. From a literary viewpoint the chapters received a mixed reaction. Some, like Capote biographer Gerald Clarke, consider Answered Prayers to be the culmination of the factual novel form first employed by the author with In Cold Blood and a testimonial to his talent's ability to transcend substance abuse. Norman Mailer praised Capote's technique but questioned the seemingly frivolous plotline of escapades among the socially outmoded jet set. Composition In the introduction to his 1980 collection, Music for Chameleons, Capote detailed the writing process of the novel: If this chronology is to be believed, Capote stopped work on Answered Prayers in September 1977 after suffering what he considered to be a \\"nervous breakdown\\". After a period of consideration and reorganization, he claimed to have completed substantial revisions on the chapters published in Esquire with the exception of \\"Mojave\\", a vignette situated outside of the diegetic framework of the novel that was intended to be the second chapter before Capote elected to excise it from the work; in 1980, it was republished as a standalone short story in Music for Chameleons. However, further evidence makes Capote's statements seem less credible. Fox corroborates Capote to a large extent and claimed to have seen all four of the Esquire chapters in 1975, but Gerald Clarke's biography indicates that only the recently written \\"Mojave\\" and \\"La Cote Basque\\" were in any sort of publishable condition by that date. (Nevertheless, both \\"Unspoiled Monsters\\" and \\"Kate McCloud\\" were published in 1976, a period coinciding with one of the lowest ebbs in Capote's personal life.) Capote's legendary and almost stenographic journals, considered by a minority of friends to have been the foundation of his literary output, have never surfaced after his death, let alone in a revised form. By all accounts, he spent those years in a drug- and alcohol-induced haze. Theories regarding missing chapters Comparable in length to Capote's earlier works of long fiction, the three chapters published in Esquire were collected by Random House in 1987 as Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel. An unpublished short narrative bearing the title of one of the missing chapters (\\"Yachts and Things\\") was later found among Capote's papers in the Manuscripts and Archives Division of the New York Public Library and published in the December 2012 issue of Vanity Fair, which billed it as the long-lost work. Apart from its title, however, the piece appears to be a separate work, and in 2013 it was added to a Modern Library edition of The Complete Stories of Truman Capote as a self-contained story. Revised versions of the Esquire chapters and \\"Yachts and Things\\" that were purported to have existed, along with \\"A Severe Insult to the Brain\\" (a vignette about Jerry Zipkin, a prominent real estate heir, social escort, and Nancy Reagan intimate); \\"And Audrey Wilder Sang\\" (an account of \\"the beautiful people of Hollywood and New York... and how they're not so beautiful\\"); and \\"Father Flanagan's...\\" (the final chapter) have never been located.Capote Truman: Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel, page xviii. Random House, 1987 In the years prior to his death, Capote frequently read from these chapters to friends at dinners, but such was his gift of storytelling that few could discern whether he was actually reading from a manuscript or improvising. He arranged to sell \\"Father Flanagan's...\\" to Esquire during Clay Felker's editorship in the early 1980s for $35,000; although he claimed that he only \\"needed to tighten a few screws,\\" the excerpt was never submitted.Plimpton, George: \\"Truman Capote\\", page 442. Anchor Books, 1998 Capote alleged that lover John O'Shea had absconded with \\"A Severe Insult to the Brain\\" in 1977 and subsequently sued for repossession, but he eventually reconciled with O'Shea and dropped the lawsuit in 1981. According to Joseph Fox, at least four of Capote's friends (including John Knowles and Lester Persky) reportedly read or listened to Capote read selections from \\"some of the... chapters... probably 'Father Flanagan's All-Night Nigger Queen Kosher Cafe' and 'A Severe Insult to the Brain,'\\" while Persky professed to have copied and bound a complete manuscript that subsequently vanished.Plimpton, George: \\"Truman Capote\\", page 448. Anchor Books, 1998 Longtime Capote confidante Joanne Carson contended that she read three \\"very long\\" chapters (\\"And Audrey Wilder Sang\\", \\"Yachts and Things\\", and \\"Father Flanagan's...\\") that completed the novel in the early 1980s. On the morning preceding his death, Capote handed a key to Carson for a safe deposit box or locker that contained the completed novel, stating that \\"[the chapters] will be found when they want to be found.\\" When Carson pressed Capote for a precise location, he proffered myriad locations in various locales that he frequented, including Manhattan, Palm Springs, Los Angeles and New Orleans. An exhaustive search for the manuscript after Capote's death yielded nothing.Plimpton, George: \\"Truman Capote\\", page 449-51. Anchor Books, 1998 In his editor's note, Fox \\"hesitantly\\" theorized that the chapters did exist at one juncture but were \\"deliberately destroyed\\" by Capote in the early 1980s.Capote Truman: Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel, page xxi. Random House, 1987 Andreas Brown likewise believes that Capote, a trenchant perfectionist, \\"may well have destroyed the manuscripts\\" during his intermittent periods of sobriety.Plimpton, George: \\"Truman Capote\\", page 440. Anchor Books, 1998 A third and less tantalizing belief held by a minority of Capote's closest friends (including Andy Warhol and Capote's life partner Jack Dunphy) was that the publication of \\"La Cote Basque\\" had traumatized Capote to the extent where he ceased all work on Answered Prayers after finishing \\"Kate McCloud\\" and was incapable of finishing it. In his diary, Warhol made frequent mention of drunken ramblings related to the novel by Capote but was never able to secure any serious plot details. When he did discuss the contents of one of the chapters to a privileged Brigid Berlin, Warhol was incensed that she did not tape the discussion. In 2019, a commentary on the novel was published in Russia with a circulation of 300 copies. A Russian literary researcher and Ph. D History specialist Denis Zakharov told the story of the creation and publication of the unfinished novel, made an explanation of the most complicated episodes, collected the information about the reaction of people who served as prototypes of the heroes of the novel. ‚ÄúAmericans should translate this book into English in order to better understand Capote and his novel‚Äù, said famous Russian translator of Capote's works Viktor Golyshev.

He coined the term \\"history from below\\", which was later popularised by the British Marxist Historians, and the phrase the \\"death certificate of the old order\\" to describe the Great Fear of 1789. Among his most significant works was the 1924 book Les Paysans du Nord pendant la R√©volution fran√ßaise (\\"The Peasants of the North During the French Revolution\\"), which was the result of 20 years of research into the role of the peasantry during the revolutionary period. Personal background Lefebvre was born in Lille to a family of modest means. He attended public school, obtaining his secondary and university training with the help of scholarships. Lefebvre attended the University of Lille, and it was here that he followed the \\"special curriculum\\", which emphasized modern languages, mathematics, and economics instead of the classical languages. It was as a result of his schooling that Georges Lefebvre was able to teach in a series of secondary schools for more than twenty years after his graduation in 1898. After his career in teaching secondary school students, Lefebvre began teaching at the university level. He became more and more influenced by Marxism about the time of the Second World War. Lefebvre was influenced by the Marxist idea that history should be concerned with economic structures and class relations. He died in Paris in 1959. The French Revolution Lefebvre began writing in 1904, but it was not until 1924, at the age of fifty, that he was finally at the point in his career - no longer preoccupied with supporting his family - that he was able to finish his doctoral thesis: Les Paysans du Nord pendant la R√©volution fran√ßaise. This work was a detailed and thorough examination of the effects of the French Revolution on the countryside. Lefebvre‚Äôs work on this thesis was \\"based on a thorough analysis of thousands of tax rolls, notarial records, and the registers of rural municipalities, whose materials he used to trace the effects of the abolition of feudalism and ecclesiastical tithes, the consequences of property transfers, the movement of the bourgeoisie onto the countryside, and the destruction of collective rights in the peasants villages\\". He often wrote from a viewpoint which he felt the peasant of the time would have held. His \\"the Coming of the French Revolution\\" identified four key champions: the aristocracy (which prevented monarchical reform), the bourgeoisie, the urban revolution (storming the Bastille), and the peasant revolution. Fellow historians tend to examine the last 35 years of Lefebvre's writings (1924-1959). This period is chosen because it is when he wrote his most influential and \\"much more complex interpretation of the Revolution than had hitherto prevailed amongst historians\\". Peter Jones elaborates that Lefebvre‚Äôs take on the Revolution has three major emphases: the idea that the countryside peasantry actively participated in the Revolution, the idea that this participation was not significantly influenced by the bourgeoisie, and the idea that the peasants largely agreed on an anticapitalist way of thinking in the 1790s. Accomplishments Lefebvre's account of the origins of the French Revolution was written in Quatre-Vingt-Neuf(meaning 89), and published in 1939 to mark the sesquicentennial of the events of 1789, but the Vichy government that took over the following year wanted no left-wing history or sympathetic understanding of the Revolution, as they drew their support from the anti-republican right. The Vichy r√©gime suppressed the book, ordering 8,000 copies to be burned; as a result the work was virtually unknown in its native land until it was reprinted in 1970. Its reputation was already secure in the English-speaking world, however, since the English translation, The Coming of the French Revolution (1939) had established it as a clear, yet subtle, classic. It remains the definitive explanation of the Marxist interpretation of the causes of the Revolution. His seminal work, La R√©volution Fran√ßaise (revised edition, 1951) was translated into English as two volumes: The French Revolution From Its Origins To 1793 (1962-4) and The French Revolution from 1793 to 1799 (1964). He also wrote a highly regarded study of Napol√©on (4th edition 1953; translated in 2 volumes, 1969). A doctoral dissertation by Lawrence Davis, entitled Georges Lefebvre: Historian and Public Intellectual, 1928-1959, as the title suggests, concentrates on the latter part of Lefebvre‚Äôs life and on the scholarly publications that made Lefebvre a noteworthy historian. Davis expands on the concept of mentalit√© that Lefebvre developed, arguing that this is \\"a term that represented their collective goal of documenting the material and mental worlds of people of the past, where the social and cultural existed comfortably side by side\\". Throughout the work, Davis stressed the notion that Lefebvre used this concept of mentalit√© of the peasantry to explain the Revolution.

By 1914 he had already published a collection of documents, entitled Documents relatifs √† l‚Äôhistoire des subsistances dans le district de Bergues pendant la R√©volution (1788-An V). Lefebvre continued to engrave all that he could on the French Revolution and all that dealt with it, well into his old age and beyond his retirement from the position of Chair at the Sorbonne in 1945.

From 1947 until 1968, Cura ran a business selling the 250,000-plus tele-snaps he took. The photographs were snapped in half of a normal frame of 35mm film, at an exposure of 1/25th of a second. Generally around 70‚Äì80 tele- snaps were taken of each programme. They were mostly purchased by actors and directors to use as records and examples of their work before the prevalence of videocassette recorders. For many early programmes tele-snaps are the only surviving record of their appearance. From the 1990s onwards, tele-snaps have often been used by groups of fans to recreate lost Doctor Who episodes, creating \\"reconstructions\\" by marrying the images to fan-recorded off-air soundtracks of the episodes. History A sequence of tele-snaps from the missing Out of the Unknown episode \\"The Prophet\\" From a young age, Cura had been interested in electronics and photography, developing a reputation among his family as a \\"Heath Robinson inventor\\".Lewisohn, John Cura: Snapshots of History In June 1946, the BBC resumed its television service following the hiatus imposed by the Second World War. Cura, recently demobilised from the RAF, combined his twin passions of photography and electronics and began to experiment with developing a camera that could take pictures from a television screen. He eventually came up with a mechanism that took half-frame 18√ó24 mm images on 35 mm film (i.e. the same format as in 35 mm motion picture cameras), at a speed of 1/25th of a second. Once satisfied with his process, Cura wrote to the BBC on 11 September 1947 enclosing samples of his work and requesting permission to exploit the images commercially. Cura's request caused considerable consternation in the BBC's legal department who were concerned about copyright. Ultimately, the BBC concluded that a television image was not covered by existing copyright law and replied to Cura giving him permission to proceed but to \\"only photograph the television image of individual artists who have instructed you to do so prior to their television appearance, and that you do not give or sell the photographs to anyone other than the artist in question\\".Bignell, John Cura ‚Äì Photographer of the Lost Archive, p. 12. Cura often ignored this restriction, however, frequently sending tele-snaps to artists on spec in the hope of attracting business from them. Many of his clients were BBC programme makers who found his photographs useful records of their work. In 1951, Cura came once again to the attention of the BBC's lawyers when he requested that he be allowed to photograph entire BBC productions, writing that his service \\"enables you to have a permanent pictorial record for valuable reference in years to come, of series which have a brief life of an hour or so and are then lost forever\\".Bignell, John Cura ‚Äì Photographer of the Lost Archive, p. 13. The BBC had also been contacted by several newspapers at this time, looking for permission to use Cura's tele- snaps‚Äîespecially after it transpired that Cura had taken the only image of Oxford's boat sinking during that year's Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge. The BBC made petitions to the Houses of Parliament to have the Copyright Acts overhauled to give them legal certainty regarding the issue. Although a revised Copyright Bill was enacted in 1956, it did little to curtail Cura's activities. Cura's business was at its peak in the mid-fifties, his business having doubled overnight following the launch of ITV in 1955. A second television set was purchased and a second camera constructed to enable Cura to photograph both channels. Cura also enjoyed success with two best- selling books on improving television reception and correcting picture faults, which were illustrated with his tele-snaps. He also appeared on the BBC's television panel game show What's My Line?. Celebrity clients of the tele- snaps service included Benny Hill and the Beverley Sisters. By 1959, Cura claimed to have taken over 250,000 tele-snaps and that sets of his tele-snaps had been \\"presented to and graciously accepted by the Royal Family; Their Majesties the King of Denmark; the late King of Norway; Queen Juliana of the Netherlands; Ex-president Auriol of France; Earl Attlee; Sir Winston Churchill; Mr Charles Chaplin; Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt\\"Bignell, John Cura ‚Äì Photographer of the Lost Archive, p. 14. as well as a wide range of newspapers and periodicals. However, when Cura raised the prices for his service in 1964, the BBC ordered a review of the tele-snap service, which at this stage was costing them ¬£1,300 per annum, and, with many programmes now routinely recorded on film or video, the business began to decline. John Cura continued to take tele-snaps right up within a few months of his death in 1969 from colon cancer. His widow offered her late husband's collection of tele-snaps to the BBC but was turned down. It is believed that they were subsequently destroyed.\\"Emily [Cura's widow] told us that when John died she got in touch with the BBC and said, \\"I've got a garage full of photos, do you want them?\\" and an executive said, \\"We're moving forward, Mrs Cura, not backwards.\\" Emily told us she was so upset that she destroyed the lot.\\" ‚Äì Teddie Beverley, quoted in Lewisohn, John Cura: Snapshots of History. However, many copies of tele-snaps survive on broadcasters' production files and in the private collections of many of the artists and technicians whose work Cura photographed. Cultural significance In the early days of television, the means of making recordings of television programmes were limited and programmes were, in the main, transmitted live. This began to change as techniques for recording programmes onto film (telerecording) and, later, videotape were developed in the 1950s. Even after the technology for recording programmes had become the norm, it was a common practice, due to a combination of the costs of storage and restrictions on broadcasting repeats, for UK broadcasters to wipe programmes after transmission. As a result, John Cura's tele-snaps are often the only surviving record of many lost programmes from the early years of television. Tele-snaps have been used to reconstruct lost television shows by marrying up the tele-snaps with audio recordings of missing shows to create a slide-show backed by the programme's soundtrack. Most notably, this technique has been employed, on an amateur, not-for-profit basis, by some enthusiasts of the British science fiction series Doctor Who, which has nearly a hundred missing episodes. Some professional reconstructions using tele-snaps have also been created, including: * A brief (15-minute) reconstruction of episodes two and three of the Doctor Who serial The Ice Warriors for its VHS videotape release in 1998. * A full reconstruction of the final episode of the Doctor Who serial The Tenth Planet for its VHS videotape release in 2000. * A full reconstruction of the Doctor Who serial The Power of the Daleks for the MP3 CD release of that story in 2005. This reconstruction was later included in the DVD release of an animated version of the serial in 2016. https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=the-power-of-the-daleks-dvd- artwork-and-extras-unveiled. *Similar full reconstructions of all four episodes of The Macra Terror and parts 2,4,5 and 6 of The Faceless Ones (with the surviving parts represented by the original episodes) have also been included in the subsequent DVD releases of animated versions in 2019 and 2020 respectively.https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=the-macra-terror-dvd-and- bluray-cover-art-and-special-features- revealedhttps://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=the-faceless-ones-dvd-bluray- reveal * A condensed (30-minute) reconstruction of the seven-part Doctor Who serial Marco Polo for the DVD release, \\"The Beginning\\", in 2006. * A condensed reconstruction of the missing episodes of the 1961 science fiction serial A for Andromeda for its DVD release in 2006.

Originally a trim upgrade based on the Tempest, it spawned the industry changing signature muscle car, the GTO, in 1964. Manufactured in five generations in the 1960s and '70s, it was replaced by the downsized Pontiac Bonneville for the 1982 model year. From 1988 to 1994 the name was resurrected for a badge-engineered version of the Daewoo LeMans manufactured by Daewoo in South Korea. First generation (1961‚Äì1963) =1961= The LeMans was introduced as the top-of-the-line version of the compact-sized Pontiac Tempest toward the end of the 1961 model year on GM's new Y body platform. The Tempest LeMans was a trim package featuring sportier and more luxurious trim than the Tempest, including different badging and bucket seats. The trim option was available only on the two-door sedan (pillared coupe) body style. =1962= For the 1962 model year, the LeMans was still a trim package, but now also available in the convertible body style, as well as with the I4 4-bbl carbureted engine. There was also no pillarless hardtop body style available in either the Tempest and LeMans versions. =1963= For 1963, the LeMans name was still used only on two-door coupes and convertibles, but now was designated as a separate model in the Pontiac compact car lineup. This would last for just one year. Optional was a high-performance \\"326 CID V8\\" engine (actually displacing during the 1963 model year). A slant 4 was also available. File:1962 Pontiac Lemans Convertible.jpg1962 Pontiac Tempest LeMans convertible Second generation (1964‚Äì1967) =1964= 1964 LeMans Convertible The Tempest line was changed to an intermediate-sized car on the new GM A platform in 1964. The LeMans was its own separate model like it was in 1963 which included carpeted lower door panels, deluxe steering wheels, courtesy lighting, and full wheel covers. For 1964, a two-door hardtop was added. A new I6 was introduced, as well as a redesigned V8 that now actually displaced 326 CID. Shortly after the start of the 1964 model year, the LeMans became available with a new performance package designated as the GTO, or 'Gran Turismo Omologato'. The GTO option included a V8 from the full-sized Pontiac line that produced 325 HP with a four-barrel carburetor or 348 HP in Tri-Power] version featuring three two-barrels. =1965= The LeMans line was expanded to include a four-door sedan for the 1965 model year. Horsepower ratings for the GTO version were increased to 335HP 4bbl and 360 Hp Tri power hp, a four-speed floor shift Muncie manual transmission with Hurst shifter, heavy-duty suspension, red-line Tiger Paw tires. With the Introduction of the Tempest in 1961, Pontiac achieved the number three in sales and something it would hold onto through the decade of the Sixties. The success and the aggressive image of the GTO also spilled over and helped increase the image and sales of the entire Pontiac line. =1966= 1966 Pontiac LeMans four-door hardtop The pillared 4-door sedan was replaced by a four-door hardtop body style for the 1966 model year. The GTO became a separate model of its own for 1966, though retaining the same basic body as the Tempest and LeMans models. For 1966, all Pontiac intermediates got new styling featuring tunnelback rooflines on two-door hardtop and pillared coupes. While the GTO continued as a big-engined muscle car, the Tempest and LeMans models got a new SOHC I6 as the base engine. This engine, as well as the early Tempest with the transaxle in the rear, were ideas of Pontiac's Chief Engineer John DeLorean (who became Pontiac's general manager at the end of the 1965 model year). This engine was available in an economical one-barrel carbureted, 165 hp version as standard equipment on all Pontiac intermediates except GTOs. Optional on all Tempest and LeMans models except station wagons was a Sprint package that included a four-barrel version of the I6 that also included higher compression ratio and hotter cam, resulting in 207 horsepower, along with an \\"all-syncro\\" floor- mounted three-speed transmission with Hurst shifter, suspension kit, and body striping. Optional were a two-barrel 326 CID V8 rated at 250 hp or a 285 hp four-barrel 326 HO V8 with higher compression ratio and dual exhausts. The Sprint-optioned Tempest and LeMans models were not popular during the mid-to- late 1960s, being outsold by the bigger-engined GTO. The Sprint option and SOHC six-cylinder engine were discontinued after 1969, and replaced with a Chevrolet-built 250 CID OHV six-cylinder engine, becoming the base engine from 1970 to 1976 in most Pontiac intermediates. Third generation (1968‚Äì1972) The four-door Safari station wagon became available for the 1968 model year in the Tempest line. A new engine replaced the 326. This new engine was based on all existing Pontiac engine architecture and using the 326, 389, and 400 engines crank at 3.75\\" and expanding the 326's 3.72\\" bore to 3.88\\" to give 353.84 cubic inches. It was marketed by Pontiac as a 350, just like the original 326 was called rather that its true size of 325.84. For 1968 the 350 could be had in two versions at 265 hp 2bbl and 325 hp 4bbl. In 1969 the engine came as 265 hp 2bbl and 330 hp 4bbl. The ten horsepower increase over 1968's engine is due to a different cam plus the use of the # 48 big valve heads, the same head used on the Ram air 3 400\\" engine and the 428-HO engine at 390 hp. 1969 would be the last high performance version of the 350. The Sprint OHC six had gone from its original size of 230 inches to 250 cubic inches, and the horsepower had increased from the original to in its final version in 1969. For 1970, Pontiac reshuffled its intermediate lineup with the Le Mans nameplate downgraded to the mid-line sub-series previously known as the Tempest Custom and included two- and four-door pillared sedans, while the previous top Le Mans series was renamed the Le Mans Sport in the same three body styles including a four-door hardtop sedan, two-door hardtop coupe and convertible. This year, bigger engines - which had previously reserved for GTOs - were made available on lesser Tempest/Le Mans models including a 400 CID V8 rated at with a two-barrel carburetor or a option with a four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts. At mid-year the bottom Tempest line, which initially included only two- and four-door sedans, added the T-37 hardtop coupe which was initially described as \\"General Motors' lowest-priced hardtop (undercut by a base Chevrolet Chevelle hardtop coupe introduced a few weeks later). Less expensive than the GTO, the T-37 hardtop coupe offered a GT-37 appearance package that included striping, three-speed floor shift transmission, tuned suspension and other trim. The GT-37 was available with any Tempest/Le Mans V8 from the standard 350 two-barrel to the 400 four- barrel. Replacing the Pontiac-built OHC six-cylinder as the base engine for Tempest/Le Mans models for 1970 was Chevrolet's 250 cubic-inch straight-six engine, while the 350 two-barrel was again the base V8 and the four-barrel 350 HO was discontinued. In 1971, the Tempest nameplate was retired and Pontiac promoted the Le Mans nameplate to full-series status to identify all of its intermediate models, which still included the GTO. At the bottom of the line was the Pontiac T-37, previously known as the Tempest, and now expanded to include two- and four-door sedan along with the original hardtop coupe. The GT-37 option was available on both the two-door sedan (pillared coupe) or hardtop coupe. Engine offerings were carried over from 1970 and Pontiac's 455 cubic-inch V8 (offered only on GTOs in 1970) was now available as an option on all Pontiac intermediates in both base four-barrel with 325 horsepower or the 455 HO option with 335 horsepower. All 1971 engines were detuned with lower compression ratios to run on lower-octane regular leaded, low-lead or unleaded gasoline. Brakes were 9.5\\" drums. For 1972, all Pontiac intermediates were now Le Mans models and the low-priced T-37 line was replaced by a base Le Mans pillared coupe. The top-line intermediate was the Luxury Le Mans, available in hardtop sedan and coupe models, featuring upgraded interiors compared to regular Le Mans models. The Le Mans Sport was available as a two-door hardtop or convertible with Strato bucket seats and interiors from the Luxury Le Mans. The GTO was changed from a separate series back to an option package on Le Mans and Le Mans Sport coupes. Replacing the previous GT-37 option package for 1972 was the new \\"Le Mans GT\\" option, available on Le Mans pillared and hardtop coupes with any V8 ranging from the 350 two-barrel to the 455 HO four- barrel, and also included the same appearance and handling items carried over from the GT-37.

During this period, Pontiac's intermediate lineup included the base Le Mans, Le Mans Sport Coupe, GTO (1973 only), Luxury Le Mans (became the Grand Le Mans in 1975), the Euro-styled Grand Am from 1973 to 1975, and the 1977 Can Am. Body styles were all based on GM's Colonnade design for both sedans and coupes (no convertibles or hardtops offered after 1972) that included center pillars for improved rollover safety standards but eliminated true hardtop design, along with frameless windows similar to a hardtop. Two-door coupes featured triangular \\"fixed\\" rear side windows that did not open, which were covered with louvers on the Le Mans and GTO sport coupes, and the new Grand Am coupe. =1973= The 1973 Le Mans, along with all other GM intermediates, was new from the ground up but retained the same wheelbase lengths of 112 inches for two-door coupes, and 116 inches for four-door sedans and station wagons. All models featured the federally mandated 5-mile-per-hour front bumpers along with single headlights. Handling capabilities were greatly improved on all models due to new front-suspension components shared with the F-body Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro, improved rear-coil suspension and bias-belted tires (except Grand Ams, which got radial tires). Engine offerings were carried over from 1972 with revisions to meet the 1973 emission requirements. Standard on base Le Mans sedans and coupes was Chevrolet's 250-cubic-inch inline six-cylinder engine, while the Le Mans Sport Coupe, Luxury Le Mans sedans and coupes, and all Safari wagons got Pontiac's 350-cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor rated at 150 horsepower standard (optional on base Le Mans models). Optionally available on Le Mans, Le Mans Sport and Luxury Le Mans was a 400-cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carb and 170 horsepower, a 230-horsepower 400 four-barrel (standard with the GTO option) and a 250-horsepower 455 four-barrel was optional on all models. Planned and listed as an option for the 1973 GTO but never materialized was a 455 Super Duty V8 rated at 310 net horsepower for which introduction was delayed by Pontiac management due to emission issues until the spring of 1973 and then only in the smaller Firebird Formula and Trans Am pony cars. A three-speed automatic transmission was standard on Le Mans and Luxury Le Mans models while the GTO came with a floor-mounted three-speed with Hurst shifter. Available at extra cost was the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic with all engines, while a four- speed manual with Hurst shifter was available with the 230-horsepower 400. 1973 Pontiac Le Mans sport coupe =1974= Changes for the 1974 Le Mans included new split grilles with horizontal bars on base Le Mans and Le Mans Sport models, while Luxury Le Mans models got chromed vertical bar split grilles. Model offerings in each series were the same as 1973, except for the addition of a new Luxury Le Mans Safari wagon and the deletion of the GTO series from the intermediate line to the compact Pontiac Ventura series. Out back were new federally mandated 5 mph bumpers to match the similarly mandated front bumpers of the previous year and less curvaceous rear end treatment with vertical taillights and license plate/fuel filler moved above the bumper. Base Le Mans coupes retained the fixed full triangular rear side windows while Luxury Le Mans coupes got a smaller vertical opera window similar to the Grand Prix along with an optional Landau rear quarter vinyl roof. Le Mans Sport Coupes were now available with two rear side window treatments - the louvered triangular version carried over or the opera window with Landau vinyl roof from the Luxury Le Mans. All engines were carried over from 1973 including the 250 inline six, and V8s including the 350 two-barrel, 400 two- and four-barrel and 455 four-barrel. New to the option list for 1974 was a 350 four-barrel. The same assortment of three- and four-speed manual transmissions were carried over for 1974 along with the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic. New to the option list for 1974 on all models were GM-specification radial-ply tires manufactured by GM's usual tire suppliers that included revised suspension tuning. =1975= The 1975 Le Mans received mostly trim changes including new crosshatch grilles on base and Sport models, and a distinctive vertical bar grille with more chrome on the Grand Le Mans (renamed from Luxury Le Mans) series cars and only revised nameplates and taillight lenses in the rear. Interiors were revised on top Grand Le Mans cars to include the distinctive wrap-around dashboard from the Grand Prix and Grand Am models with simulated African Crossfire Mahogany trim, a notchback bench seat with armrest in sedans and wagons or a no-cost choice of the notchback bench or Strato bucket seats in coupes. Base Le Mans and Sport Coupe models carried over trim only slightly revised from 1974 including a revised Custom Cushioned steering wheel. Pontiac's Maximum Mileage System consisted of GM's new catalytic converter that reduced emissions while improving drivability and fuel economy, a High Energy electronic ignition, and lengthened routine maintenance intervals. Radial tires were standard on all models and a \\"Radial Tuned Suspension\\" option was available that included upgraded radial tires along with front and rear sway bars. Engines were revised for 1975 to meet that year's emission requirements and mated to the catalytic converter, which spelled the end of true dual exhausts. The 250 cubic-inch Chevy inline six was standard on base Le Mans coupes and sedans while the 350 two-barrel V8 was optional and standard on the Le Mans Sport Coupe, and Grand Le Mans sedans and coupes, and optional engines on all of those models including a 350 four-barrel and a 400 two-barrel. Le Mans and Grand Le Mans Safari wagons came standard with a 400 four-barrel engine that was optional on other models. The 455 V8 was discontinued for all LeMans models for 1975, but still available in the Grand Am. Transmission offerings included a three-speed manual standard with the six-cylinder and 350 two-barrel V8, with the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic optional with those engines, a \\"mandatory\\" option with all other engines in sedans and coupes, and standard on the Safari wagons. The Hurst-shifted four- speed manual was no longer offered. =1976= 1976 Pontiac Le Mans For 1976, the Le Mans and Grand Le Mans were the only Pontiac intermediate offerings with the discontinuation of the Grand Am series. All models received new rectangular headlights with distinct grilles unique to the base and Le Mans Sport and another one for the Grand Le Mans. The Grand Le Mans had the instrument panel of the 1973-75 Gran Am, while the Le Mans and Le Mans Sport continued with the regular dash. The 1973-75 Luxury Le Mans had the regular Le Mans instrument panel. The Chevy-built 250 straight-six was now standard on all Le Mans and Grand Le Mans sedans and coupes along with the Le Mans Sport Coupe with V8 options including a new \\"Oldsmobile-built\\" 260 V8 and Pontiac V8s of 350 and 400 cubic inches with two- or four-barrel carburetion (400 four-barrel still standard on all Safari wagons), along with the return of the 455 four-barrel V8 after a one-year absence. The three-speed manual transmission was standard with the Chevy six with Turbo Hydra-matic optional, the latter now the only transmission offered with all V8s except the small 260 which could be ordered with a five-speed manual in the Le Mans Sport Coupe. Also new for 1976 was an \\"Enforcer\\" police package on Le Mans sedans with either the 400 or 455 V8s that included Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, variable ratio power steering, heavy duty power front disc brakes and suspension tuning. =1977= 1977 Pontiac Le Mans Sport Coupe The 1977 model year was the last for the Le Mans and Grand Le Mans built off the 1973-vintage Colonnade body. Appearance changes were limited to revised grilles and taillight lenses. Engine offerings were revised with Buick's 231 cubic-inch V6 replacing the Chevy inline six as the base power plant in sedans and coupes. The base V8 (standard on Safari wagons and optional on other models) was Pontiac's new 301 cubic-inch engine based on the same V8 engine block as other Pontiac V8s but utilized many lightweight components. Optional V8s were pared down to Pontiac-built 350 and 400 four-barrel powerplants. The three-speed manual was the standard transmission on V6 models, while the Turbo Hydra-matic was optional and the only transmission available with the V8 engines. Those drivetrain offerings were available in 49 states. In California, Pontiac V8s were not offered for 1977 due to the inability to meet that state's more stringent regulations. In the Golden State, the Buick V6 was standard on most models but the V8 engines offered there were Oldsmobile's 350 and 403 four- barrel engines. Turbo Hydra-matic was the only transmission offered in California. A sporty-performance model based on the Le Mans Sport Coupe called the Pontiac Can Am was a one-year only offering for 1977. The Can Am came standard with the 400 four-barrel V8 in 49 states or the Olds 403 four-barrel in California, along with Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, a Grand Prix instrument panel and console, along with Strato bucket seats, and rear spoiler. It was partially intended as a replacement for the 1973-75 Grand Am, whose departure had caused A-body sales to drop significantly, combined with the fact that the Pontiac models had always been the weakest sellers of the line with a high percentage of low-profit fleet sales. For the final year of the Colonnade Le Mans models, they were joined by newly downsized B-body Catalina and Bonneville full-sized cars, which weighed a few pounds less than the \\"intermediates\\" and rode on the same 116-inch wheelbase length as the Le Mans sedans and Safari wagons and also had similar dimensions as far as length and width were concerned. The intermediates would have to wait one more year for downsizing, and although the new B-bodies made them redundant, it was still considered necessary to sell both as a hedge in case the B-body cars proved to be troublesome. In addition, many customers still preferred the tried-and-true Colonnade intermediates to the B-bodies and they continued to sell well for their final year, mostly thanks to the coupe models. Fifth generation (1978‚Äì1981) 1979 Pontiac Le Mans sedan In 1978, the Le Mans and other GM mid-sized cars were considerably downsized and lost some 600-800 lb. Pontiac's engines were also downsized, with the standard engine being the Buick 3.8 L 231 ci V6, Pontiac 265 ci V8, or optional Pontiac 4.9 L 301 ci V8 for 1978, (a Chevy 305 ci V8 in California). 1978 also saw Pontiac's 350 ci & 400 ci engine production shut down after many years of service as its hallmark V8s. A limited production run of 400ci engines was made, but were only available in 1978 and 1979 Trans Ams equipped with the four-speed manual transmission. Chevrolet's 350 V8 was available in 1979 LeMans Safaris (station wagon) only.Gunnell and Kowalke, p. 155 From 1978 to 1980, Pontiac's mid-sized lineup included the base Le Mans, Grand Le Mans, and a revived Grand Am; all available as a Coupe, Sedan, or Wagon. In 1980, the Grand Am was only offered only as a coupe, and the \\"Grand Am\\" nameplate was again discontinued until 1985, when it was used on Pontiac's new compact car -- a form the Grand Am would take for the next two decades. 1980 Pontiac Grand Le Mans coupe The final year for the mid-sized Le Mans was 1981 with only base and Grand Le Mans models offered initially. They were joined mid-year by a new LJ trim level positioned between the base and Grand models. The car was given a new Firebird-esque slanted nose which made the 2-door coupe popular in NASCAR, especially as a superspeedway race car in 1981, which was the first year these cars were used in the series. A Le Mans driven by Cale Yarborough won the 1983 Daytona 500, and one driven by Tim Richmond at the 1983 Pocono 500. Engine offerings by this time included Buick's 231 CID V6, Pontiac's 4.3 L 265 CID V8, Pontiac's 301 CID V8, and Chevrolet's 305 CID V8 (for California only). For 1982, because the larger Pontiacs were not selling well, GM decided to discontinue the full-sized Catalina and Bonneville. The Bonneville name was then simply swapped onto the smaller G-body sedan and wagon because GM reasoned that it carried a higher level of name recognition with customers than LeMans; the wagon was replaced by the Pontiac 6000 wagon and overlapped with the Bonneville Safari for two years while the Grand Prix served as the de facto replacement for the coupe. This \\"new\\" Bonneville amounted to little more than the existing LeMans with revised front and rear fascia designed to mimic the departed Pontiac B-body. In Canada, this model continued to use the Grand LeMans name through 1983, after which it was badged as a Bonneville. Due to GM cost-cutting measures, Pontiac's remaining V8's, the 265 and 301 were both discontinued late in 1981, with all engine development to focus on the Pontiac Iron Duke four-cylinder engines for GM's smaller cars. That engine was essentially half of a Pontiac 301 V8. The new engine lineup now consisted of the Buick 3.8 L V6, Chevrolet 305 V8, and Oldsmobile 350 diesel V8. For 1984, the Bonneville Safari Wagon was dropped, while the Bonneville four-door sedan continued through the 1986 model year. Beginning in 1987, the Bonneville nameplate was moved to a slightly larger front-wheel-drive sedan that shared its basic platform with the Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile Delta 88; by 1992, the W body-based Grand Prix had evolved from its personal luxury car origins to become Pontiac's sole midsize offering. Sixth generation (1988‚Äì1994) 1992 Pontiac Le Mans sedan The Pontiac Le Mans nameplate was revived in 1988 as a rebadged Daewoo LeMans; a subcompact car sold in the North American and New Zealand markets until 1994 as a captive import. In North America, three- door hatchback and a four-door sedan body styles were offered. It replaced the Pontiac 1000. The Pontiac/Daewoo Lemans was a rebadged variant of the Opel Kadett; Opel Kadett Combo (European markets); Vauxhall Astra Mark 2, Vauxhall Belmont, Bedford Astravan, Bedford Astramax (Britain); Chevrolet Kadett (in Brazil); and the UzDaewooAuto Nexia (in Uzbekistan).

As Subaru's first entry into the luxury/performance market, the SVX was noted for its aircraft- inspired 'window-within-a-window' side-glass configuration. The nameplate \\"Alcyone\\" (pronounced \\"al-SIGH-uh-nee\\") refers to the brightest star in the Pleiades constellation, stylized in the Subaru company logo. The suffix \\"SVX\\" is an acronym for \\"Subaru Vehicle X\\".  Development  Alcyone SVX hood emblem The Subaru Alcyone SVX debuted as a concept at the 1989 Tokyo Auto Show with styling by noted Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro of ItalDesign. The SVX entered production, retaining its window-within-a-window configuration, adapted from the previous generation Subaru Alcyone with an additional extension of glass covering the A-pillar -- which Subaru described as an \\"aircraft-inspired glass-to-glass canopy.\\" In contrast to the angular XT, the SVX featured softer lines with its two-piece power side windows. The windows are split about two-thirds of the way from the bottom, with the division being parallel to the upper curve of the door frame similar to the half-windows of the Lamborghini Countach, DMC DeLorean (another Giugiaro design), and the McLaren F1. The SVX featured a drag coefficient of , identical to that of the XT coupe it replaced. European market cars had a slightly lower wind resistance of , thanks to a larger undertray.Mayersohn (1991), p. 72. From 1991 to 1992, Subaru displayed the Amadeus, a prototype shooting brake variation on the SVX, in both two- and four-door versions, which was considered for production. Ultimately the Amadeus was not produced.  Powertrain  The SVX debuted with and remained available with only one engine, the EG33 model 3.3-liter boxer horizontally opposed flat-six. This engine was the largest engine produced by Subaru for its passenger cars until the introduction of the 3.6-liter EZ36 engine in the 2008 Subaru Tribeca. The previous generation Subaru Alcyone had a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, but the larger EG33 was more powerful and so a turbo was not installed. EG33, quad cam, 24 valve engine Internally, the engine is essentially a six-cylinder variant of the EJ22 found in the first-generation Japanese market Legacy and Impreza. The new 3.3-liter variant was equipped with DOHC and four valves per cylinder, and had an increased compression ratio of 10.1:1, bringing horsepower up to at 5,400 rpm with of torque at 4,400 rpm. Fuel delivery was accomplished with sequential multi-port fuel injection with dual-spray injectors. Engine ignition used platinum spark plugs and a computerized management system with \\"limp home feature\\", which included over-rev protection, as well as monitors for fuel injection and ignition. The exhaust system consisted of head pipes from each bank of cylinders with their own pre- catalytic converters, which entered a dual-inlet / single outlet main catalytic converter. A single exhaust pipe exited the main converter and went into a resonator, and onto the main, transverse, single-inlet muffler with twin exhaust tips in the bumper. The SVX was offered solely with an automatic transmissions, as Subaru did not offer a manual transmission capable of handling the horsepower and torque of the EG33 engine at the time. Subaru offered two all-wheel drive systems for the automatic transmission, called ACT-4 or VTD. The first system, called ACT-4 (active torque split) was introduced on the 1988.5 Alcyone using an electronic control unit to vary the torque applied to the rear wheels dynamically based on driving conditions. As an active system, it varied the torque split infinitely based on several inputs. This AWD system was used throughout the entire production run in vehicles manufactured for sale in the US, Canada, Germany, France and Switzerland. A more advanced system called VTD (variable torque distribution), was introduced and used on SVX for sale in Japan, the UK, the Benelux region, Sweden, Australia, Spain, Austria and Brazil. The VTD AWD system adds a planetary center differential. The system retains the use of the ACT clutch and active control, though its size and role are much smaller as it is used only to suppress differential action instead of the complete differential function. When no speed difference exists between front and rear, the entire VTD gear rotates as a unit and torque split is at a mechanical 36/64 biased by the planetary gear ratio. The clutch is incorporated to prevent and suppress any differential action that may occur as the planetary gear will send virtually all torque to the axle with the highest speed if not restrained. By using a similar logic to the previous ACT system, the clutch can theoretically direct any percentage of torque to either axle, but in practice the variation remains between 34-50% front and 64-50% rear. This system is not capable of operating in 2WD and therefore could not be used on 2WD dynos as required for emissions testing in some states. This prevented VTD as an option on Subaru vehicles offered for sale in US until passenger car regulations were changed, which occurred long after the end of svx production. It was later introduced to the US with the Outback VDC.Subaru SVX and Isuzu Piazza [Japanese language] Problems with early SVX transmissions included a defective torque converter clutch which disintegrates and clogs early radiators (both clutch and radiator changed in 1993), and had systemic high clutch failures due to lower than spec pump pressure, fluid evacuation, and clutch balance pressure. Several major revisions were made, all of which are included by late 1994 production. Shortly after the SVX ended production Subaru transitioned to a completely redesigned 4 speed unit. The Japanese-spec \\"SVX L\\" received four-wheel steering in 1991 and 1992 (model code \\"CXD\\" of which 1,905 were built). The VTD equipped versions received the \\"CXW\\" chassis code. In an attempt to lower the price for the US market, a front-wheel drive (\\"CXV\\") was offered in 1994 and 1995 but sales were less than stellar. *0-60 mph: 7.3 seconds *1/4 mile: 15.4 seconds at *Top speed: (1992‚Äì93), (1994+ due to the addition of an electronic speed governor)Mayersohn (1991), pp. 36, 95. *60-0 mph: Motorweek Road Test of the SVX, 1991  Market  Sales of the SVX reached 14,257 in the United States and a total of 24,379 worldwide. 2,478 SVXs were sold in Europe (with 854 headed directly to Germany and 60 to France). Roughly 7,000 of all SVXs sold were right-hand drive models. Included in this number were the 249 vehicles sold in Australia, at a cost between approx. A$73,000 to A$83,000. 5,884 units remained in Japan. The SVX was also developed and released during Japan's \\"bubble economy\\", and as the economic condition in Japan continued to decline, it had an effect on sales in Japan. = Asia = In Japan, the SVX was the first Subaru to exceed government dimension regulations with regards to the vehicles exterior measurements. The SVX also obligated Japanese buyers to pay more annual road tax which limited sales due to the engine displacement. The SVX was not Subaru's first car to be sold in Japan with an engine bigger than two litres; this honor goes to the preceding Alcyone XT6. The models offered in Japan were the L (similar to the LSi in the US) and the S4. As a result, in Japan the SVX was considered a luxury vehicle and was equipped appropriately with one-touch climate control, leather interior, front seats that were both electrically adjustable and heated, a single-disc CD player coupled with a Panasonic AM/FM stereo system, that was hidden behind a retractable panel, and a remote-controlled infrared keyless entry with security system. Later S-Four badged versions had . Some later Japanese models also came with upgraded 17-inch BBS alloy wheels instead of the 16-inch wheels most cars have. Television advertising in Japan used Alison Krauss singing \\"Five Hundred Miles\\", a reference to the car being able to travel on one tank of fuel, with a fuel economy of . = North America = A Subaru SVX in the United States. Subaru introduced the SVX in the United States in July 1991 (as a 1992 model), following the US debut with a Japanese market introduction in September of that same year. The model was designed and marketed as the replacement for the Alcyone XT and Alcyone XT6 coupes. Outside Japan, the Alcyone designation was dropped, and the car was marketed as the Subaru SVX. The 1992 Subaru Legacy received a facelift inspired by the SVX. The introduction of the SVX followed the 1990 introduction of the Acura NSX and the 1980 introduction of the Isuzu Piazza. The MSRP) for the US base model 1992 SVX-L was $24,445, with the top of the line model with touring package (leather trim, 8 way electronic seat adjustment, tilt and slide sunroof), the LS-L, listing at $28,000. This was $8,000‚Äì$11,000 higher than any previous Subaru. A rear spoiler was optional on the 1992 L and LS-L models and was included as standard equipment beginning in 1993. There was a brief XR model in 1992 that included the spoiler standard but put the vehicle over the import weight limit. As a result, the spoiler was shipped separately. By the end of its production run in 1996, the price had risen to $36,740 for the top-of-the- line LSi, which was the same trim level as the 1992 LS-L A front-wheel drive version was offered on the SVX during the 1994‚Äì1995 model year, which cost about $5,300 less than the AWD version in 1994 and $1500 difference in 1995. In 1994, FWD was offered on both the base L model (X33 in the VIN) and on the mid-range LS model (X34 in the VIN). In 1995, only the base L model was offered in FWD (X33 in the 5th, 6th and 7th digits of the VIN). With Subaru forecasting sales of 10,000 each year, SVX sales reached 5,280 in 1992 and 3,859 cars in 1993. Production ended in December 1996, with sales continuing into 1997 -- and 640 units sold in the final year.  Motorsports  In 1991, a Subaru SVX, driven by Ken Knight and Bob Dart, won the Alcan Winter Rally, a race starting in Seattle to the Arctic Circle and back. In the early 1990s there was a Subaru SVX PPG Pace Car. It featured a silver to purple fade paint job, silver wheels in the front, purple wheels in the rear, \\"SVX\\" windshield banner, roll cage and an amber roof light. It was evaluated by Wally Dallenbach Sr, Indy Car Chief Steward and PPG Pace Car evaluator. It was used as a promotional tool for Subaru, as well as a pace car. While most pace cars were retired after one season, the SVX proved to be such a worthy example and a favorite, and was used for several seasons. It was in storage for many years in the \\"Subaru Performance Attic\\" in Cherry Hill, New Jersey near Subaru of America's new headquarters in Camden, New Jersey.

The most common type of flat-six engine is the boxer-six engine, where each pair of opposed cylinders moves inwards and outwards at the same time. The advantages of the flat-six layout are good engine balance (for reduced vibration), a low center of gravity, short length (compared with an inline-six engine) and being well suited to air-cooling. The disadvantages are a large width (which can limit the maximum steering angle when used in a front-engined car), a large intake manifold being required when a central carburetor is used, and duplication of the inlet and outlet connections for water-cooled engines. The first production flat-six engine was in the 1904 Wilson-Pilcher 18/24 HP car. The most notable use of flat-six engines is the Porsche 911 sports car, which has used flat-six engines continuously since 1963. Several other car manufacturers, including Subaru, have produced flat-six engines at times. Flat-six engines have also occasionally been used in aircraft and motorcycles.  Engine balance  A boxer-style flat-six engine is able to have perfect primary and secondary balance. As per other six-cylinder engines, the overlapping power strokes of the cylinders (with a firing interval of 120 degrees in a four-stroke engine) reduces the pulsating power delivery seen on engines with fewer cylinders. Also, when used in a boxer configuration, a flat-six engine does not have the rocking couple that is present on flat-four engines. These characteristics result in low vibration for flat-six engines (as per straight-six engines), especially when compared with the imbalances that are present in V6 engines with a 90-degree bank angle.  Use in aircraft  1945-1975 Franklin O-335 air-cooled aircraft engine Early flat-six engines include the Franklin O-265 which began production in 1940, and the Lycoming O-435 which began production in 1942. Several manufacturers use the letter \\"O\\" in the model code for flat-six engines, as an abbreviation for the opposed cylinder layout. The Franklin O-335 was used in the Bell 47 light helicopter. Flat engines largely replaced the historically more popular radial engines in small aircraft after World War II because they were less expensive to manufacture. The smaller frontal area compared with a radial engine also results in less drag. Some aircraft have used flat-six engines originally designed for cars. The Porsche PFM 3200 engine, produced from 1985-1991, was based on the engine used in the Porsche 911 sports car. Several examples of the Pietenpol Air Camper homebuilt monoplane aircraft have used the air-cooled engine from the Chevrolet Corvair compact car. Compared with the engines used in cars, flat-six engines used by helicopters have large displacements and are low revving, producing more torque and less power.  Use in automobiles  = Porsche = Porsche 911 The flat-six engine is often associated with the Porsche 911, a rear-engined sports car which has used flat-six engines exclusively since 1963. The engines were air-cooled until 1999, when Porsche started using water-cooled engines. Other Porsche models that use flat-six engines are the 1970-1972 Porsche 914/6 (mid-engine), the 1986-1993 Porsche 959 (rear-engine), and the 1996-2021 Porsche Boxster/Cayman (mid-engine). = Other manufacturers = The first car to use a flat-six engine was the 1904‚Äì1907 Wilson-Pilcher 18/24 HP, which used an engine based on a flat-four engine with two cylinders added. The Wilson-Pilcher was a front-engined car with the crankshaft in-line with the chassis and the cylinders between the chassis rails. Reports on this car quote it as being \\"remarkably silent and smooth running\\" and \\"almost total absence of vibration\\".\\"The Wilson-Pilcher Petrol Cars\\", The Automotor Journal, April 16th, 1904, pp. 463-468 Two American manufacturers briefly produced cars with flat-six engines‚Äî the 1948 Tucker 48 (water-cooled) and the 1959-1969 Chevrolet Corvair (air-cooled). Both are rear-engined cars with rear-wheel drive. Japanese manufacturer Subaru produced water-cooled flat-6 engines from 1988‚Äì1996 and 2001‚Äì2019. Their first flat-6 engine, the Subaru ER27, was added to the model range of the Subaru XT coupe. In 1991, the Subaru EG33 engine was used in the Subaru Alcyone SVX, the replacement for the Subaru XT. Following a hiatus of flat-6 engine production for four years, the Subaru EZ30 engine was introduced in the 2000 Subaru Legacy/Outback. The Subaru EZ36 engine was introduced in 2007 and was produced until 2019. All engines were used in front-engine cars with all-wheel drive, plus the XT and Alcyone SVX were also available with front-wheel drive.  Use in motorcycles  1997-2004 Honda Valkyrie engine Most motorcycles use engines with four or fewer cylinders, however the Honda Gold Wing touring motorcycle has used a water-cooled flat-six engine since 1987. Initially, the engine had a displacement of , until it was enlarged to in 2001. The Honda Valkyrie F6C (1997‚Äì2003) was a cruiser based on the GL1500 Gold Wing. The limited edition 2004 Valkyrie Rune was based on the GL1800.

It was located in unincorporated Maine Township, part of Maine Township High School District 207 which includes Maine East, Maine West, and Maine South High Schools. Opened in 1970, it closed just eleven years later in 1981, and served parts of Des Plaines, Glenview, and Niles. As student population shrank, the decision came down to closing Maine East or Maine North. Maine East, the oldest school in the district, opened in 1929, but also had considerable numbers of alumni and students with the S.O.S. (Save Our School) campaign pushing to keep it open. On November 17, 1980, the Board voted, 4‚Äì3, to close Maine North by 1981, citing that it was not only the smallest school, but the least centrally located of the schools in the district.

It is located in the Mekong Delta, in the southwestern part of the country.  Geography  An Giang occupies a position in the upper reaches of the Mekong Delta. The H·∫≠u Giang and Ti·ªÅn Giang branches of the Mekong River are the dominant geographical features of the province. With the exception of the west, most of An Giang is fairly flat and is criss-crossed by many canals and small rivers. This terrain has led to An Giang being a significant agricultural center, producing significant quantities of rice. The C·∫•m Mountains, also known as the Th·∫•t S∆°n range or the \\"Seven Mountains\\", are located in the western T·ªãnh Bi√™n District.

It is believed that An Giang was once an important center of the 1st millennium √ìc Eo culture, presumably owing to its position on the river. Traditionally, An Giang has been known for its silk industry. An Giang is home to a sizable number of people from Vietnam's ethnic minorities. Due to the province's proximity to Cambodia, the Khmer Krom are the largest non- Vietnamese group. Other groups, such as the Chams and ethnic Chinese (Hoa), are also found in An Giang.

It is usually audible. Causes *Burping is usually caused by swallowing air when eating or drinking and subsequently expelling it, in which case the expelled gas is mainly a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen. *Burps can be caused by drinking beverages containing carbon dioxide, such as beer and soft drinks, in which case the expelled gas is mainly carbon dioxide. *Diabetes drugs such as metformin and exenatide can cause burping, especially at higher doses. This often resolves in a few weeks. *Burping combined with other symptoms such as dyspepsia, nausea and heartburn may be a sign of an ulcer or hiatal hernia, and should be reviewed by a physician. *Other causes of burping include: food allergy, gallbladder diseases, esophageal reflux , H. pylori, acid reflux disease and gastritis. Complications In microgravity environments, burping is frequently associated with regurgitation. With reduced gravity, the stomach contents are more likely to rise up into the esophagus when the gastroesophageal sphincter is relaxed, along with the expelled air.Vickie Kloeris (1 May 2001). Eating on the ISS . Interview with Lori Keith. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Retrieved 2011-11-12. Disorders *Inability to burp is uncommon *Chest pain associated with burping can occur, but is rare. Society and culture =Acceptance= Some cultures regard burping as acceptable in certain situations, for example, in South Asia, it signals the host that the guest has enjoyed the food and is full. In Japan, burping during a meal is considered bad manners. Burping during a meal is also considered unacceptable in Western cultures, such as North America and Europe. In Middle Eastern countries, it is not acceptable to burp out loud in public, and one should silence one's burp, or at least attempt to do so. =Infants= Babies are likely to accumulate gas in the stomach while feeding and experience considerable discomfort (and agitation) until assisted. Burping an infant involves placing the child in a position conducive to gas expulsion (for example against the adult's shoulder, with the infant's stomach resting on the adult's chest) and then lightly patting the lower back. Because burping can cause vomiting, a \\"burp cloth\\" or \\"burp pad\\" is sometimes employed on the shoulder to protect clothing. =Contest= The current Guinness World Record for the loudest burp is 109.9 dB, set by UK's Paul Hunn at Butlins in Bognor Regis on 23 August 2009. This is louder than a jackhammer at a distance of . =Burped speech= It is possible to voluntarily induce burping through swallowing air and then expelling it, and by manipulation of the vocal tract produce burped speech. While this is often employed as a means of entertainment or competition, it can also act as an alternative means of vocalisation for people who have undergone a laryngectomy, with the burp replacing laryngeal phonation. This is known as esophageal speech. Other animals Many other mammals, such as cows, dogs and sheep also burp. =Ruminants= Much of the gas expelled is produced as a byproduct of the ruminant's digestive process. These gasses notably include a large volume of methane, produced exclusively by a narrow cohort of methanogenic archaea in the animal's gut; Escherichia coli (E. coli) and other bacteria lack the enzymes and cofactors required for methane production. A lactating cow produces about 322g of methane per day, i.e. more than 117kg per year through burping and exhalation, making commercially farmed cows a major (37%) contributor to anthropogenic methane emissions, and hence to the greenhouse effect. 95% of this gas (wind) is emitted through burping. This has led scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation of Perth, Australia, to develop an anti-methanogen vaccine to minimize methane in cow burps. One reason why cows burp so much is that they are often fed foods that their digestive systems cannot fully process, such as corn and soy. Some farmers have reduced burping in their cows by feeding them alfalfa and flaxseed, which are closer to the grasses that they had eaten in the wild before they were domesticated. The failure to burp successfully can be fatal. This is particularly common among domesticated ruminants that are allowed to gorge themselves on spring clover or alfalfa. The condition, known as ruminal tympany, is a high-pressure buildup of gas in the stomach(s) and requires immediate treatment to expel the gas, usually the insertion of a flexible rubber hose down the esophagus, or in extreme cases the lancing of the animal's side with a trochar and cannula. =Birds= There is no documented evidence that birds burp, though ornithologists believe that there is nothing which physiologically prevents them from doing so. However, since the microbiota of birds do not include the same set of gas-producing bacteria that mammals have to aid in digestion, gas rarely builds up in the gastrointestinal tracts of birds.

In a total laryngectomy, the entire larynx is removed (including the vocal folds, hyoid bone, epiglottis, thyroid and cricoid cartilage and a few tracheal cartilage rings). In a partial laryngectomy, only a portion of the larynx is removed. Following the procedure, the person breathes through an opening in the neck known as a stoma. This procedure is usually performed by an ENT surgeon in cases of laryngeal cancer. Many cases of laryngeal cancer are treated with more conservative methods (surgeries through the mouth, radiation and/or chemotherapy). A laryngectomy is performed when these treatments fail to conserve the larynx or when the cancer has progressed such that normal functioning would be prevented. Laryngectomies are also performed on individuals with other types of head and neck cancer. Post-laryngectomy rehabilitation includes voice restoration, oral feeding and more recently, smell and taste rehabilitation. An individual's quality of life can be affected post-surgery. History The first total laryngectomy was performed in 1873 by Theodor Billroth. The patient was a 36 year old man with a subglottic squamous cell carcinoma. On November 27, 1873 Billroth performed a partial laryngectomy. Subsequent laryngoscopic examination in mid-December 1873 found tumor recurrence. On December 31, 1873 Billroth performed the first total laryngectomy. The patient recovered, and an artificial larynx was manufactured for him which enabled the patient to speak despite the removal of his vocal cords. Older references credit a Patrick Watson of Edinburgh with the first laryngectomy in 1866, but this patient's larynx was only excised after death. The first artificial larynx was constructed by Johann Nepomuk Czermak in 1869. Vincenz Czerny developed an artificial larynx which he tested in dogs in 1870. Incidence/Prevalence According to the GLOBOCAN 2018 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were 177,422 new cases of laryngeal cancer worldwide in 2018 (1.0% of the global total.) Among worldwide cancer deaths, 94,771 (1.0%) were due to laryngeal cancer. In 2019 it is estimated that there will be 12,410 new laryngeal cancer cases in the United States, (3.0 per 100,000). The number of new cases decreases every year at a rate of 2.4%, and this is believed to be related to decreased cigarette smoking in the general population. The number of laryngectomies performed each year in the U.S. has been declining at an even faster rate due to the development of less invasive techniques. A study using the National Inpatient Sample found that there were 8,288 total laryngectomy cases performed in the US between 1998 and 2008, and that hospitals performing total laryngectomy decreased by 12.3 per year. As of 2013, one reference estimates that there are 50,000 to 60,000 laryngectomees in the US.  Identification  To determine the severity/spread of the laryngeal cancer and the level of vocal fold function, indirect laryngoscopies using mirrors, endoscopies (rigid or flexible) and/or stroboscopies may be performed. Other methods of visualization using CT scans, MRIs and PET scans and investigations of the cancer through biopsy can also be completed. Acoustic observations can also be utilized, where certain laryngeal cancer locations (e.g. at the level of the glottis) can cause an individual's voice to sound hoarse. Examinations are used to determine the tumor classification (TNM classification) and the stage (1-4) of the tumor. The increasing classifications from T1 to T4 indicates the spread/size of the tumor and provides information on which surgical intervention is recommended, where T1-T3 (smaller tumors) may require partial laryngectomies and T4 (larger tumors) may require complete laryngectomies. Radiation and/or chemotherapy may also be used. The airways and ventilation after laryngectomy 171x171px The anatomy and physiology of the airways change after laryngectomy. After a total laryngectomy, the individual breathes through a stoma where the tracheostomy has created an opening in the neck. There is no longer a connection between the trachea and the mouth and nose. These individuals are termed total neck breathers. After a partial laryngectomy, the individual breathes mainly through the stoma, but a connection still exists between the trachea and upper airways such that these individuals are able to breathe air through the mouth and nose. They are therefore termed partial neck breathers. The extent of breathing through the upper airways in these individuals varies and a tracheostomy tube is present in many of them. Ventilation and resuscitation of total and partial neck breathers is performed through the stoma. However, for these individuals, the mouth should be kept closed and the nose should be sealed to prevent air escape during resuscitation.  Complications  Different types of complications can follow total laryngectomy. The most frequent postoperative complication is pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF), characterized by an abnormal opening between the pharynx and the trachea or the skin resulting in the leaking of saliva outside of the throat. This complication, which requires feeding to be completed via nasogastric tube, increases morbidity, length of hospitalization, and level of discomfort, and may delay rehabilitation. Up to 29% of persons who undergo total laryngectomy will be affected by PCF. Various factors have been associated with an increased risk of experiencing this type of complication. These factors include anaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, poor nutrition, hepatic and renal dysfunction, preoperative tracheostomy, smoking, alcohol use, older age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and localization and stage of cancer. However, the installation of a free-flap has been shown to significantly reduce the risks of PCF. Other complications such as wound infection, dehiscence and necrosis, bleeding, pharyngeal and stomal stenosis, and dysphagia have also been reported in fewer cases. Rehabilitation = Voice restoration = Total laryngectomy results in the removal of the larynx, an organ essential for natural sound production. The loss of voice and of normal and efficient verbal communication is a negative consequence associated with this type of surgery and can have significant impacts on the quality of life of these individuals. Voice rehabilitation is an important component of the recovery process following the surgery. Technological and scientific advances over the years have led to the development of different techniques and devices specialized in voice restoration. The desired method of voice restoration should be selected based on each individual‚Äôs abilities, needs, and lifestyle. Factors that affect success and candidacy for any chosen voice restoration method could include: cognitive ability, individual physiology, motivation, physical ability, and pre-existing medical conditions. Pre and post-operative sessions with a speech-language pathologist (SLP) are often part of the treatment plan for people undergoing a total laryngectomy. Pre-operative sessions would likely involve counselling on the function of the larynx, the options for post-op voice restoration, and managing expectations for outcomes and rehabilitation. Post-operative therapy sessions with an SLP would aim to help individuals learn to vocalize and care for their new voice prosthesis as well as refine their use of speech depending on the chosen method of voice restoration. Voice prosthesis Available methods for voice restoration: * For tracheoesophageal speech, a voice prosthesis is placed in the tracheo- oesophageal puncture (TEP) created by the surgeon. The voice prosthesis is a one-way air valve that allows air to pass from the lungs/trachea to the esophagus when the stoma is covered, where the redirected air vibrates the esophageal tissue to produce a hoarse voice. The TEP and voice prosthesis combination allows individuals post-laryngectomy to have a voice to speak, while also avoiding aspiration of saliva, food or other liquids. Tracheoesophageal speech is considered more natural sounding than esophageal speech, but voice quality differs from person to person. * For speech using an electrolarynx, an electrolarynx is an external device that is placed against the neck and creates vibration that the speaker then articulates. The sound has been characterized as mechanical and robotic. * For esophageal speech, the speaker pushes air into the esophagus and then pushes it back up, articulating speech sounds to speak. This method is time-consuming and difficult to learn and is less frequently used by laryngectomees. * For larynx transplants, a larynx from a cadaver donor is used as a replacement. This option is the most recent and is still very rare. For individuals using tracheoesophageal or esophageal speech, botulinum toxin may be injected to improve voice quality when spasms or increased tone (hypertonicity) is present at the level of the pharyngoesophageal segment muscles. The amount of botulinum toxin administered unilaterally into two or three sites along the pharyngoesophageal segment varies from 15 to 100 units per injection. Positive voice improvements are possible after a single injection, however outcomes are variable. Dosages may need to be re-administered (individual-dependent) after a number of months, where effective results are expected to last for about 6 to 9 months. = Oral feeding = The laryngectomy surgery results in anatomical and physiological changes in the larynx and surrounding structures. Consequently, swallowing function can undergo changes as well, compromising the patient's oral feeding ability and nutrition. Patients may experience distress, frustration, and reluctance to eat out due to swallowing difficulties. Despite the high prevalence of post-operative swallowing difficulties in the first days following the laryngectomy, most patients recover swallowing function within 3 months. Laryngectomy patients do not aspirate due to the structural changes in the larynx, but they may experience difficulty swallowing solid food. They may also experience changes in appetite due to a significant loss in their senses of taste and smell. In order to prevent the development of pharyngocutaneous fistula, it is common practice to reintroduce oral feeding as of the seventh to tenth day post-surgery, although the ideal timeline remains controversial. Pharyngocutaneous fistula typically develops before the reintroduction of oral feeding, as the pH level and presence of amylase in saliva is more harmful to tissues than other liquids or food. Whether the reintroduction of oral feeding at an earlier post-operative date decreases the risk of fistula remains unclear. However, early oral feeding (within 7 days of the operation) can be conducive to reduced length of hospital stay and earlier discharge from the hospital, entailing a decrease in costs and psychological distress. = Smell and taste rehabilitation = A total laryngectomy causes the separation of the upper air respiratory tract (pharynx, nose, mouth) and lower air respiratory tract (lungs, lower trachea). Breathing is no longer done through the nose (nasal airflow), which causes a loss/decrease of the sense of smell, leading to a decrease in the sense of taste. The Nasal Airflow Inducing Manoeuvre (NAIM), also known as the \\"Polite Yawning\\" manoeuvre, was created in 2000 and is widely accepted and used by speech-language pathologists in the Netherlands, while also becoming more widely used in Europe. This technique consists of increasing the space in the oral cavity while keeping the lips closed, simulating a yawn with a closed mouth by lowering the jaw, tongue and floor of the mouth. This causes a negative pressure in the oral cavity, leading to nasal airflow. The NAIM has been recognized as an effective rehabilitation technique to improve the sense of smell.  Quality of life  People with a partial laryngectomy are more likely to have a higher quality of life than individuals with a total laryngectomy. People having undergone total laryngectomy have been found to be more prone to depression and anxiety, and often experience a decrease in the quality of their social life and physical health. Voice quality, swallowing and reflux are affected in both types, with the sense of smell and taste (hyposnia/anosmia and dysgeusia) also being affected in total laryngectomies (a complaint which is given very little attention by medical professionals). Partial or total laryngectomy can lead to swallowing difficulties (known as dysphagia). Dysphagia can have a significant effect on some patients' quality of life following surgery. Dysphagia poses challenges in eating and social involvement, often causing patients to experience increased levels of distress. This effect holds true even after the acute phase of recovery. More than half of patients who received total laryngectomy were found to experience restrictions in their food intake, specifically in what they can eat and how they can eat it. The diet limitations imposed by dysphagia can negatively impact a patient's quality of life, as it can be perceived as a form of participation restriction. Accordingly, these perceived restrictions are more commonly experienced by dysphasic laryngectomy patients compared to non-dysphasic laryngectomy patients. Therefore, it is important to consider dysphagia in short and long- term outcomes post-laryngectomy in order for patients to uphold a higher quality of life. Often, speech-language pathologists are involved in the process of prioritizing swallowing outcomes. People receiving voice rehabilitation report best voice quality and overall quality of life when using a voice prosthesis as compared to esophageal speech or electrolarynx. Furthermore, individuals going through non-surgical therapy report a higher quality of life than those having undergone a total laryngectomy. Lastly, it is much more difficult for those using alaryngeal speech to vary their pitch, which particularly affects the social functioning of those speaking a tonal language.

In mathematics, the Smith‚ÄìVolterra‚ÄìCantor set (SVC), fat Cantor set, or Œµ-Cantor setAliprantis and Burkinshaw (1981), Principles of Real Analysis is an example of a set of points on the real line ‚Ñù that is nowhere dense (in particular it contains no intervals), yet has positive measure. The Smith‚ÄìVolterra‚ÄìCantor set is named after the mathematicians Henry Smith, Vito Volterra and Georg Cantor. In an 1875 paper, Smith discussed a nowhere-dense set of positive measure on the real line,Smith (1874) and Volterra introduced a similar example in 1881.Bressoud (2003) The Cantor set as we know it today followed in 1883. The Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is topologically equivalent to the middle-thirds Cantor set.  Construction  Similar to the construction of the Cantor set, the Smith‚ÄìVolterra‚ÄìCantor set is constructed by removing certain intervals from the unit interval [0, 1]. The process begins by removing the middle 1/4 from the interval [0, 1] (the same as removing 1/8 on either side of the middle point at 1/2) so the remaining set is :\\\\left[0, \\\\frac{3}{8}\\\\right] \\\\cup \\\\left[\\\\frac{5}{8}, 1\\\\right]. The following steps consist of removing subintervals of width 1/4n from the middle of each of the 2n‚àí1 remaining intervals. So for the second step the intervals (5/32, 7/32) and (25/32, 27/32) are removed, leaving :\\\\left[0, \\\\frac{5}{32}\\\\right] \\\\cup \\\\left[\\\\frac{7}{32}, \\\\frac{3}{8}\\\\right] \\\\cup \\\\left[\\\\frac{5}{8}, \\\\frac{25}{32}\\\\right] \\\\cup \\\\left[\\\\frac{27}{32}, 1\\\\right]. Continuing indefinitely with this removal, the Smith‚ÄìVolterra‚ÄìCantor set is then the set of points that are never removed. The image below shows the initial set and five iterations of this process. 512px Each subsequent iterate in the Smith‚ÄìVolterra‚ÄìCantor set's construction removes proportionally less from the remaining intervals. This stands in contrast to the Cantor set, where the proportion removed from each interval remains constant. Thus, the former has positive measure while the latter has zero measure.  Properties  By construction, the Smith‚ÄìVolterra‚ÄìCantor set contains no intervals and therefore has empty interior. It is also the intersection of a sequence of closed sets, which means that it is closed. During the process, intervals of total length : \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{2^n}{2^{2n + 2}} = \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{8} + \\\\frac{1}{16} + \\\\cdots = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\, are removed from [0, 1], showing that the set of the remaining points has a positive measure of 1/2. This makes the Smith‚ÄìVolterra‚ÄìCantor set an example of a closed set whose boundary has positive Lebesgue measure.  Other fat Cantor sets  In general, one can remove r_n from each remaining subinterval at the n th step of the algorithm, and end up with a Cantor-like set. The resulting set will have positive measure if and only if the sum of the sequence is less than the measure of the initial interval. For instance, suppose the middle intervals of length a^n are removed from [0, 1] for each n th iteration, for some 0 \\\\le a \\\\le \\\\dfrac{1}{3} . Then, the resulting set has Lebesgue measure : \\\\begin{align} 1 - \\\\sum _{n=0}^{\\\\infty } 2^n a ^ {n+1} &= 1 - a \\\\sum _{n=0}^{\\\\infty } (2a) ^ {n}  &= 1 - a \\\\dfrac{1}{1 - 2a}  &= \\\\dfrac{1 - 3a}{1 - 2a} \\\\end{align} which goes from 0 to 1 as a goes from 1/3 to 0 . ( a > 1/3 is impossible in this construction.) Cartesian products of Smith‚ÄìVolterra‚ÄìCantor sets can be used to find totally disconnected sets in higher dimensions with nonzero measure. By applying the Denjoy‚ÄìRiesz theorem to a two-dimensional set of this type, it is possible to find an Osgood curve, a Jordan curve such that the points on the curve have positive area..  See also  * The SVC is used in the construction of Volterra's function (see external link). * The SVC is an example of a compact set that is not Jordan measurable, see Jordan measure#Extension to more complicated sets. * The indicator function of the SVC is an example of a bounded function that is not Riemann integrable on (0,1) and moreover, is not equal almost everywhere to a Riemann integrable function, see Riemann integral#Examples.

Career =Early life and marriage= Lu You was born on a boat floating in the Wei River early on a rainy morning, October 17, 1125 (Chinese calendar). At the time of his birth, China was divided and the once- glorious Song dynasty in the northern part of the country had been invaded by the Jurchens of the Jin dynasty in the Jin‚ÄìSong wars. The southern part of China continued to hold out as the Southern Song dynasty for another 150 years, but during Lu You's entire life, the country was threatened by invasion from the north. He is known for his many patriotic poems. Excerpt from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica ..article on Lu You One year after his birth, the troops of the Jin dynasty conquered the capital of the Northern Song dynasty; his family fled to the south. Lu You's family included government officials, and he received a good education. He was brought up to be patriotic, and grew up determined to expel the foreign Jurchen from the North and bring about the reunification of China under the Song dynasty. Lu You grew up with his cousin Tang Wan (ÂîêÁê¨), who was quiet but loved literature. They fell deeply in love and were married when he was 20. But they had no children, and his mother did not like Tang Wan. Though they had lived happily together, his mother forced them to divorce in order to make Lu You concentrate on studying to fulfill his aspiration of saving the Song dynasty. In traditional Chinese culture, children were required to obey their parents. Lu You loved his mother and reluctantly divorced Tang Wan. She later married a nobleman named Zhao Shicheng (Ë∂ôÂ£´Á®ã), and he married a woman from the Wang clan (her personal name eludes most researchers). Lu You was sad after his first marriage broke up. One spring day, at age 31, eight years after their divorce, he passed by Shen's Garden (Ê≤àÂúí) Photo of Shen Garden in modern-day Shaoxing, Zhejiang, China and by chance encountered Tang Wan and her husband. Tang Wan asked her husband to let her send a cup of wine to Lu You. When her hands passed the wine to him, he saw her eyes brimmed with tears. His heart was broken, and he drank the cup of bitter wine to the bottom. He turned away and on the spot wrote the poem \\"Fonqhwang Hairpinin\\" (Chai Tou Feng, ÈáµÈ†≠È≥≥) on the wall of Shen's Garden. Notable Women of China: Shang Dynasty to the Early Twentieth Century, by Barbara Bennett Peterson, p. 280 After this meeting with Tang Wan, Lu You went to the North to struggle against the foreign Jin dynasty, before returning to southern Shu (ËúÄ, today's Sichuan) to pursue his dream of unifying China. When Tang Wan read Lu You's poem in the garden, she immediately wrote one in the same form in response. Less than a year later, she died. In the year before Lu You‚Äôs death, at age 85, he wrote another poem called ‚ÄúShen's Garden‚Äù to commemorate Tang Wan, his first love. A traditional Yue opera was written about Lu You and Tang Wan,Article on the opera and their love story is very famous in China. =Official career= At age 12, Lu You was already an excellent writer, had mastered the skill of sword fighting, and had delved deeply into war strategy. At age 19, he took the civil service examination, but did not pass. Ten years later, he took it again; this time he not only passed it, he was the first winner in the Lin An region. But this triumph brought him trouble. Qin Sun, the grandson of the powerful Qin Hui (Áß¶Ê™ú, a notorious aristocratic traitor in the Song Dynasty), had also taken the exam. Lu You's win threatened Qin Sun's position, as Lu You was now likely to take first place in the next year's national examination. In fact, not only Lu You, but all the potential winners of the next year's nationwide competition were excluded, along with even some of the examination officers. After Qin Hui's death, Lu You started his official career in government. Because he avidly insisted on fighting against the Jin dynasty and did not follow the mainstream official lethargy on the subject, he was dismissed from his job. In 1172, he was hired to do strategic planning in the military. Military life opened his eyes and mind; he hoped to fulfill his aspiration of bringing a divided China back together. He wrote many unrestrained poems to express his passionate patriotism. But the Song Dynasty was by now corrupt and indolent; most officers just wanted to make a nice living; Lu You had no opportunity to deploy his talent.\\"Entering upon a public career by virtue of his father's services, he fell into disfavour with Qin Hui; but after the latter's death he received an appointment, and in 1163 the Emperor Xiaozong(Â≠ùÂÆó) made him a Compiler for the Privy Council and conferred upon him the honorary degree of Jinshi(ÈÄ≤Â£´).\\" Entry on Lu You (Lu Yu) in A Chinese Biographical Dictionary, Herbert Giles, 1898, republished 2005 by Harvard University Press He was unsuccessful in his official career: he adopted a patriotic irredentist stance, advocating the expulsion of the Jurchen from northern China, but this position was out of tune with the times. In 1175, Fan Chengda(ËåÉÊàêÂ§ß) asked him to join his party. They shared literary interests, and now behaved casually in official society. Lu You felt there was no place for him in official life, and started to become self-indulgent, enjoying drinking to forget his lack of success in his personal life and career pursuit. He gave himself the art name \\"Fangweng\\" (ÊîæÁøÅ), meaning \\"Liberated Old Man\\", and was sarcastic about himself in his poems. After several promotions and demotions, Lu You retired in 1190 to live in seclusion in his hometown Shaoxing (Á¥πËàà, now in Zhejiang province), then a rural area. He spent the last twenty years of his life there. Lu You enjoyed good health and liked eating pearl barley and tree-ear mushrooms. This habit kept his vision and hearing keen until death. During his retirement, he still ardently supported fighting against the Jin dynasty, but without success. His wife died in 1197. On December 29, 1209 (Chinese calendar), he died at age 86. His great regret was knowing that northern China was still in the control of the foreigners. Style Lu You wrote about eleven thousand poems,Rexroth, 126 in both the shi (Ë©©) and ci (Ë©û) forms, plus a number of prose works, which made him the poet who ranks the top in the list of numbers of the poems left before 15C. In his poetry he continues to articulate the beliefs which cost him his official career, calling for reconquest of the north. Watson identifies these works as part of the legacy of Du Fu (ÊùúÁî´). Watson compares a second body of work, poems on country life and growing old, to those of Bai Juyi (ÁôΩÂ±ÖÊòì) and Tao Qian (Èô∂ÊΩõ). His style can be divided into three periods. =First Period= The first Period of Lu You's works is from his teenage years to age 46. This period, although the longest, contains the fewest of his works, about two hundred poems, because he himself destroyed his early works in his later years. =Second Period= Second Period runs from age 46 to 54, including more than 2400 shi and ci. During this period, Lu You joined the military and was affected by that experience. =Third Period= The third Period runs from the time Lu You retired to his home town until his death. He did not have time to edit his work, and 6500 poems survive from this period. His work in this period includes peaceful pastoral images as well as desolation and bleakness. Though his style changed throughout his life, his work is always full of patriotism. This is the most important feature of his poetry, and the major reason they have been valued for almost a thousand years. =Books= *„ÄäÂäçÂçóË©©Á®ø„Äã(Jian Nan Shi Gao, the draft of poems when holding a sword in the southern borders) *„ÄäÊ∏≠ÂçóÊñáÈõÜ„Äã(Wei Nan Wen Ji, the collection of proses in the south of the Wei River) *„ÄäÊîæÁøÅÈÄ∏Á®ø„Äã(Fang Weng Yi Gao, the lost drafts of the Liberated Old Man) * „ÄäÂçóÂîêÊõ∏„Äã(Nan Tang Shu, Book of Southern Tang) *„ÄäËÄÅÂ≠∏Â∫µÁ≠ÜË®ò„Äã(Lao Xue An Bi Ji, the notebook from the House of a Person Who Studies When He Is Old) *„ÄäÊîæÁøÅÂÆ∂Ë®ì„Äã(Fang Weng Jia Xun, family precepts from the Liberated Old Man) *„ÄäÂÆ∂‰∏ñËàäÊñá„Äã(Jia Shi Jiu Wen, an old prose about the history of my family) =Poems= Lu You wrote many poems.

When the day of the emperor's troops sweeping the North comes, you must not forget to tell me at my tombstone. He composed this last poem when he was near death. What this poem means is that he does not mind not being able to take anything with him when he dies, but he is upset to see that China is still not united as a nation. He is telling his son that if this day ever comes, his family must not forget to go to his grave and tell him there. *Rainstorm on the Eleventh month 4th (ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÊúàÂõõÊó•È¢®Èõ®Â§ß‰Ωú) ÂÉµËá•Â≠§ÈÇ®‰∏çËá™ÂìÄÔºå Â∞öÊÄùÁà≤ÂúãÊàçËº™Âè∞„ÄÇ Â§úÈóåËá•ËÅΩÈ¢®ÂêπÈõ®Ôºå ÈêµÈ¶¨ÂÜ∞Ê≤≥ÂÖ•Â§¢‰æÜ„ÄÇ I slept stiff and alone in a lonely village without feeling self- pity.

'' Note: The words \\"wrong\\" and \\"don't\\" rhyme in Chinese. This poem is about his real love story (see his marriage). In this poem, \\"Biting east wind\\" is a metaphor for traditional Chinese view about women. This view broke up his first marriage. \\"Brocade book\\", or \\"glorious/bright book,\\" is another metaphor for his ambition of unifying China. But he doesn't seem to be successful in either of them (marriage and career). He also uses antithesis, which is very popular in Chinese poetry. It matches both sound and sense in two poetic lines, like \\"a heart of sorrow\\" pairing with \\"years apart\\" and \\"paramount promise\\" pairing \\"brocade book\\". The sounds match perfectly in Chinese.

Except from the Chlorarachniophyte and three species in the genus Paulinella in the phylum Cercozoa, they are all non-photosynthethic, but many foraminifera and radiolaria have a symbiotic relationship with unicellular algae. A multicellular form, Guttulinopsis vulgaris, a cellular slime mold, has also been described. This supergroup was proposed by Cavalier-Smith in 2002. Being described mainly from rDNA sequences, they vary considerably in form, having no clear morphological distinctive characters (synapomorphies), but for the most part they are amoeboids with filose, reticulose, or microtubule-supported pseudopods. Many produce shells or skeletons, which may be quite complex in structure, and these make up the vast majority of protozoan fossils. Nearly all have mitochondria with tubular cristae. Groups The three main groups of Rhizaria are: * Cercozoa ‚Äì various amoebae and flagellates, usually with filose pseudopods and common in soil * Foraminifera ‚Äì amoeboids with reticulose pseudopods, common as marine benthos * Radiolaria ‚Äì amoeboids with axopods, common as marine plankton A few other groups may be included in the Cercozoa, but some trees appear closer to the Foraminifera. These are the Phytomyxea and Ascetosporea, parasites of plants and animals, respectively, and the peculiar amoeba Gromia. The different groups of Rhizaria are considered close relatives based mainly on genetic similarities, and have been regarded as an extension of the Cercozoa. The name Rhizaria for the expanded group was introduced by Cavalier-Smith in 2002, who also included the centrohelids and Apusozoa. Another order that appears to belong to this taxon is the Mikrocytida. These are parasites of oysters. Evolutionary relationships Rhizaria are part of the Diaphoretickes (bikont) clade along with Archaeplastida, Alveolata, Cryptista, Haptista, and Halvaria. Historically, many rhizarians were considered animals because of their motility and heterotrophy. However, when a simple animal-plant dichotomy was superseded by a recognition of additional kingdoms, taxonomists generally placed rhizarians in the kingdom Protista. When scientists began examining the evolutionary relationships among eukaryotes using molecular data, it became clear that the kingdom Protista was paraphyletic. Rhizaria appear to share a common ancestor with Stramenopiles and Alveolates forming part of the SAR (Stramenopiles+Alveolates+Rhizaria) super assemblage. Rhizaria has been supported by molecular phylogenetic studies as a monophyletic group. Biosynthesis of 24-isopropyl cholestane precursors in various rhizaria suggests a relevant ecological role already during the Ediacaran. =Phylogeny= Phylogeny based on Bass et al. 2009, Howe et al. 2011, and Silar 2016.

It is a few miles across Cape Ann from downtown Gloucester. History The name \\"Annisquam\\" comes from an Algonquian term meaning \\"top of the rock, containing , \\"on top of\\", and <-ompsk>, \\"rock\\". The first European settlement in Annisquam was established in 1631. In the late 19th-century, it was home to both granite quarrying and an artist colony, which attracted painters including George Loftus Noyes and Margaret Fitzhugh Browne. Annisquam is primarily a residential neighborhood. Its only businesses include a restaurant and marina, a small hotel, a real estate company, a library and the Annisquam Yacht Club, founded in 1896. Because of its small size, historic architecture and secluded geography, Annisquam remains a popular summer resort. At the mouth of the Annisquam River on Ipswich Bay is Annisquam Harbor Light, perhaps the village's most historic edifice.

He is respected as the Sage of Tea for his contribution to Chinese tea culture. He is best known for his monumental book The Classic of Tea, the first definitive work on cultivating, making and drinking tea. Biography Lu was born in 733 in Tianmen, Hubei. For six years, Lu Yu stayed in Huomen mountain studying under the guidance of master Zou Fuzi. During this period, Lu Yu often brewed tea for his teacher. He also took care of fellow students' health using his remarkable knowledge in tea and herbs that he learned while at the Longgai Monastery. Whenever time permitted between his studies Lu Yu often went to the countryside to gather tea leaves and herbs. In one of those trips Lu Yu stumbled upon a spring underneath a 6-foot round rock and the water from the spring was extremely clear and clean. When Lu Yu brewed tea with this spring water, he found the tea tasted unexpectedly better than usual. From then on, Lu Yu realised the importance of quality water in brewing tea. Zou Fuzi was moved by Lu Yu's obsession with tea and his skill in brewing good tea. He cleared the rock together with some of his students and dug a well around the fountainhead of that spring. In 1768, just over a thousand years later during the Qing Dynasty (1616‚Äì1911), Jingling was hit by drought and the whole city was badly in need of water. City folks found water still flowing from this well uncovered by Lu Yu and dug by Zou Fuzi. A Qing official ordered three wells to be dug around the spring and a structure constructed near the wells named \\"Lu Yu Hut\\" and the \\"Literary Spring\\". In 752 Lu Yu concluded his studies, bade farewell to his shifu (teacher) Zou Fuzi and returned to Jingling to meet his benefactor Li Qiwu. However, a year earlier Li Qiwu was reinstated and returned to the Tang capital Chang'an. The new Chief Official of Jingling now was Cui Guofu. Cui, a senior official who held a position similar to an Education Minister of today, was demoted to Jingling as a Chief Official for offending a member of the royalty. Statue of Lu Yu, at the Dragon Well Tea Plantation, Meijiawu, Hangzhou Cui Guofu was a scholar and poet well known for his magnificent 5 characters per verse short poem. After his demotion to Jingling, Cui Guofu took life fairly easy. Even though Cui was many years older than Lu Yu, both men shared the same interest in tea, literature, and poetry. As such they became good friends soon after they met. During this period, Lu Yu stayed with Cui Guofu and assisted him in his administrative tasks. The two of a kind spent much time traveling, drinking tea, and writing poems, and they co-authored several books on poems. This period with Cui Guofu was the growing phase for Lu Yu as a man of letters; an incubation period for Lu Yu to practise and sharpen what he learned from his shifu Zou Fuzi. Cui Guofu, with his vast experience and skill in literary work, became a coach that provided the necessary guidance to enhance and mature Lu Yu's writing and literary skills. During this time he wrote The Classic of Tea. The original version of The Classic of Tea consisted of 3 books totaling 10 chapters: book 1 consisted of the first 3 chapters; book 2 consisted of chapter 4 only; book 3 consisted of chapters 5 to 10. After the Tang Dynasty all three books were bound into a single volume, and the three volume version was no longer available.

It was introduced in 1884 in Kobe by the Scottish pharmacist Alexander Cameron Sim. The name is derived from a Japanese borrowing of the English word lemonade. Bottle design The Codd- neck marble lock in the neck of the bottle Ramune is known for the distinctive design of its bottle, called Codd-neck bottles after their inventor, Hiram Codd. They are made of glass and sealed with a marble; the codd head is held in place by the pressure of the carbonation in the drink. To open the bottle, a plastic device used to push the marble inward is provided. The marble is pushed inside the neck of the bottle where it rattles around while drinking. Therefore, the drinks are sometimes called \\"marble soda\\" outside Japan. While the Codd-neck bottle was once commonly used for carbonated drinks, today Ramune, along with Banta, is one of its very few users. People trying Ramune for the first time sometimes find it difficult to drink, as it takes practice to learn to stop the marble from blocking the flow. In one version of the bottle introduced in 2006, little slots were added to the cap where the marble was originally held. This prevented the flow from obstruction if the marble falls back into the cap. Ramune is also available in plastic PET bottles and cans. Ramune is one of the modern symbols of summer in Japan and is widely consumed during warm festival days and nights. Empty bottles are usually collected for recycling at stalls where it is sold. Flavors The original ramune flavor is lemon-lime. Including Original, there have been at least 55 flavors of ramune: Banana, Bloody Grapefruit, Blueberry, Blue Hawaii, Bubble, Bubble Gum, Candy, Champagne, Cherry, Chili oil, Chocolate, Coconut, Cola, Cotton Candy, Corn Potage, Cream Stew, Curry, Disco Dance, Dragon Fruit, Flaming, Ginseng, Grape, Green Apple, Green Tea, Kimchi, Kiwi, Lemonade, Lychee, Mango, Mango & Pine, Melon, Muscat, Mystery, Octopus, Orange, Peach, Pineapple, Plum, Pomelo, Pomegranate, Raspberry, Red Champagne, Root Beer, Sour, Sour Watermelon, Strawberry, Sweet, Takoyaki (sauce), Teriyaki, Tropical Banana, Vanilla, Wasabi, Watermelon, Yogurt, and Yuzu.

Each year in August, they organise a commemoration of the victims of the two World Wars, combined with a rally for Flemish independence and a more conservative government policy. Many participants are members of the political party Vlaams Belang, and some are members and sympathizers of the less radical Nieuw- Vlaamse Alliantie. Ultra-right organisations, such as Voorpost and NSV, also attend. The annual event derives its name from the IJzer river, around which some of the fiercest and most deadly battles of the first World War were fought. It takes place in a field near Zuidschote, between the towns Diksmuide on the IJzer river, and Ieper. A monument in the field commemorates the Brothers Van Raemdonck, the Flemish soldiers who both fell there on March 26, 1917, killed by enemy fire and apparently having died in each other's arms. The philosophical concept behind the IJzerwake is that of \\"Godsvrede\\" (Truce of God), a medieval term referring to the unification of previously competing factions behind one common cause. This of course symbolises the meeting of the myriad of organisations in the strongly diversified Flemish Movement which the IJzerwake hopes to unite.

This pilgrimage remembers the Flemish soldiers who died while serving in the Belgian Army during the First World War and was first organised in 1920. Initially influenced by pacifism, it became increasingly associated with the Flemish Movement. It is at the same time a political meeting striving for Flemish political autonomy. The aims of the annual meeting are \\"No More War\\", \\"Autonomy\\" and \\"Truce of God\\". During the Second World War the pilgrimages were organised by the German occupying forces. Because of this link that stills goes on, Diksmuide became a gathering place of neo-Nazis from all over Europe during the weekend of the IJzerbedevaart. The IJzerbedevaart had hard times avoiding the publicity to be associated with their armed forces. The Committee organising the IJzerbedevaart answered by making its message more radical and more modern at the same time. They tried to do this by clearly stressing the original aims dating back to the First World War (No more War, Autonomy and Truce of God), and by rephrasing these aims to values of present-day interest (Peace, Freedom and Tolerance). They also diversified their activities to a.o. the museum in the IJzertoren and a music festival for peace (Ten Vrede). Some participants did not agree with both the abolishing of the Second World War blemish and the rephrasing of the message. They first tried to take over the organisation, and in 1996 they even physically attacked the president during the IJzerbedevaart. This profound discord further harmed the reputation of the pilgrimage. Eventually the dissenters, who consider themselves to be more radical, split off and formed the IJzerwake.

He was the founder of the Israelite Tribe of Reuben. Etymology The text of the Torah gives two different etymologies for the name of Reuben, which textual scholars attribute to different sources: one to the Yahwist and the other to the Elohist;New American Bible, footnote to Genesis 29:32 the first explanation given by the Torah is that the name refers to God having witnessed Leah's misery, in regard to her status as the less-favourite of Jacob's wives, implying that the etymology of Reuben derives from raa beonyi, meaning he has seen my misery; the second explanation is that the name refers to Leah's hope that Reuben's birth will make Jacob love her, implying a derivation from yeehabani, meaning he will love me. Another Hebrew phrase to which Reuben is particularly close is ra'a ben, meaning behold, a son, which is how classical rabbinical literature interpreted it, although some of these sources argue that Leah was using the term to make an implied distinction between Reuben and Esau, his uncle.Berakhot 7b Some scholars suspect that the final consonant may originally have been an l (similar to an n in the early Hebrew alphabet), and Josephus rendered the name as Reubel; it is thus possible that Reuben's name is cognate with the Arabic term Ra'abil, meaning wolves.Cheyne and Black, Encyclopedia Biblica Biblical references Reuben and his brothers by Colijn de Coter, ca. 1500, fragment of a painting in the National Museum in Warsaw In the Torah, Reuben is briefly described as having had sexual activity with Bilhah, his step-mother's maid and father's concubine. On his deathbed, Jacob declares that Reuben \\"will no longer excel, for you went up onto your father's bed, onto my couch and defiled it\\". (NIV) Reuben's behaviour angered Jacob to the extent that he gave Reuben's birthright (as firstborn) to Joseph: a comment within makes the same point. Classical rabbinical sources argue that the birthright had included the right of his descendants (the tribe of Reuben) to become ruler over the tribes (transferred to Judah) and priests (transferred to Levi). However, some of these sources argue that Reuben had not actually had sexual activity with Bilhah, but instead had simply supported the cause of his mother Leah, by harming that of Bilhah, angering Jacob; in these sources, it is argued that after the death of Rachel (Jacob's favourite wife), Jacob sought to give the precedence to Bilhah, as he had formerly preferred her as his mistress, and Reuben removed Bilhah's bed from the place where Jacob wished to have it. The classical rabbinical texts argue that Reuben immediately showed contrition for his actions in regard to Bilhah, and thus was the first penitent; initially, according to these sources, Reuben practiced penitence by secretly meditating, and also by abstaining from meat and wine, but when Judah confessed to the matter of Tamar, Reuben admitted what he had done, lest his other brothers might be suspected of his deed and punished for it. The classical sources go on to state that in honour of this voluntary penance and confession, God gave the tribe of Reuben Hosea as a member, and Reuben was given a reward in the future world. Although part of the plot against Joseph, it is Reuben who persuades the others not to kill Joseph, tries to rescue him, and who later concludes that the trouble the brothers run into in Egypt was divine punishment for the plot. In classical rabbinical literature, Reuben is described as being motivated by a sense of responsibility over his brothers (since he was the eldest), and as having become angry when he discovers that Joseph had gone missing as a result of his brothers selling him to Ishmaelites: \\"to the Ishmaelites\\" (textual scholars attribute this version of the narrative to the Yahwist) or Joseph being found and taken by Midianites: And there passed by Midianites‚Ä¶ (textual scholars attribute this version of the narrative to the Elohist). The rabbinical sources argue that the first cities of refuge were located in the territory of the tribe of Reuben, since Reuben (the individual) had tried to save Joseph from the mob of his brothers. \\"Reuben's tomb\\" in Nabi Rubin Classical rabbinical sources argue that Reuben was born on 14 Kislev, and died at the age of 125. The midrashic Book of Jasher argues that when he died, Reuben's body was placed in a coffin, and was later taken back to Israel, where it was buried. There is a Muslim tradition that Reuben was buried at a shrine in the former village of Nabi Rubin; the site was a place of pilgrimage and an annual festival before the 1948 establishment of the State of Israel. Reuben's family According to , Reuben had four sons: Hanoch, Phallu, Hezron, and Carmi. The name(s) of his wife/wives are not given. According to , a stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben marked a point along the boundary of the land allocated to the tribe of Judah.

It was built to commemorate the soldiers killed on the Yser Front in World War I and pacifism but subsequently became an important political symbol for the Flemish Movement. The original monument was constructed in 1930 but was destroyed in 1946 as a result of its political associations with Flemish nationalist collaboration after World War II. The current tower was rebuilt alongside the remains of the original and was finished in 1965. It remains a site of political significance to Flemish nationalists and is the center for their annual Yser Pilgrimage (IJzerbedevaart). Tower =First tower, 1930‚Äì1946= The idea for a distinct monument in Flanders to commemorate the Flemish soldiers killed in the Belgian Army in World War I had been discussed since at least 1916 under the patronage of the priest Cyriel Verschaeve. The project was associated with the Flemish Movement and particularly the former Frontbeweging which had emerged among Flemish soldiers themselves. After some initial efforts, construction on a -high tower-shaped monument near the Yser river at Kaaskerke near Diksmuide began in 1928. The site was symbolic because the Yser had represented the front-line of the Belgian Army for most of the war. The tower was finished in 1930 and incorporated the Frontbeweging's cruciform motto \\"All for Flanders‚ÄîFlanders for Christ\\" (Alles Voor Vlaanderen, Vlaanderen Voor Kristus, AVV‚ÄîVVK) and was unveiled at the 11th annual Yser Pilgrimage (IJzerbedevaart). In following years, the human remains of a number of \\"Yser Symbols\\" (IJzersymbolen) were reburied in the crypt of the tower, including the Van Raemdonck Brothers. Initially associated with pacificism, the site soon became one of the most important symbolic places for the Flemish Movement. The association of the Flemish Movement with collaborationism in German occupation of Belgium during World War II led two former members of the Belgian Resistance to illegally destroy the tower with dynamite on the night of 15‚Äì16 March 1946 as a reprisal. The ruins of the first tower were retained and transformed into the Peace Gate (Paxpoort) in 1950. =Second tower, 1965‚Äìpresent= The second tower still stands at the site near to the remnants of the first. It was built to roughly the same design as the first but is larger at tall. Work began in 1951 and was not finished until 1965. It houses a museum on Oorlog, vrede en Vlaamse ontvoogding (War, Peace, and Flemish Emancipation), that belongs to the United Nations network of peace museums. The museum houses the large painting, The Golden Canvass of Flanders (Het Gulden Doek van Vlaanderen) by Dutch-born Belgian painter Henry Luyten. The painting depicts a fictional meeting of the one hundred people who in Luyten's opinion played the most important roles in Flemish history.

Even though the guitar style resembled heavy metal in many aspects, GISM was one of the first Japanese hardcore bands, while at the same time drawing influence from the early industrial/avant-garde music scene‚Äîsomething uncommon in punk bands at that time. The acronym GISM has many different variations; they include: \\"Guerrilla Incendiary Sabotage Mutineer\\" (original), \\"God In the Schizoid Mind\\", \\"Grand Imperialism Social Murder\\", \\"Genocide Infanticide Suicide Menticide\\", \\"Gay Individual Social Mean\\", \\"Gothic Incest Sex Machine\\", \\"Grubby Incest Stripper Mastitis\\", \\"Gravity Impel Slaying Machine\\", \\"Get Incinerated Sorrow Mass\\", \\"Gore Impromptu Suicide Mine\\", \\"Grim Iconic Sadistic Mantra\\" and \\"Gnostic Idiosyncrasy Sonic Militant\\". GISM has attained a cult status in the international punk scene, duly for their unique blend of heavy metal and hardcore punk. Roadrunner Records ranked Sakevi Yokoyama No. 49 out of 50 of The Greatest Metal Frontmen of All Time. Biography =Career= GISM had their first performance in 1981 at the University of Tokyo. In 1983, GISM released their first album, titled Detestation, on Dogma Records. The album has been applauded for having unique vocals and a guitar style that was very uncommon in hardcore punk. M.A.N., or Military Affairs Neurotic, was released in 1987 on Beast Arts Records. The album was quite a departure from the 'Detestation' album, putting more emphasis on a slower, metal style of music compared to the hardcore punk sound of the previous release. GISM released their last album on compact disc, titled SoniCRIME TheRapy, in 2001. The band featured Kiichi Takahashi on bass and Ironfist Tatsushima on drums. Guitarist Randy Uchida died from cancer on February 10, 2001, shortly after the release of the album. GISM played two shows in Tokyo in honor of Randy Uchida, and then broke up. In 2002, GISM made the cover of Burst Magazine (issue No. 49), an underground Japanese magazine. GISM performed in the Netherlands on April 15, 2016 at Lee Dorian's Roadburn event. It was their first performance after a 13-year hiatus, along with being their first show outside of Japan. =Members and other projects= Sakevi Yokoyama continues to make collage art with his own clothing brand \\"stlTH\\", which makes T-shirt designs. In 1987, he made a cameo appearance in the Japanese film Robinson's Garden. In the movie, he attacks a Rastafarian man for teaching children spirituality. This film is the only documentation of his \\"acting\\" career. In 2004, Sakevi released a solo album titled The War under the name S.K.V. In 2006, he designed the artwork for World Burns To Death's album titled Totalitarian Sodomy. Randy Uchida (guitarist) & Hiroshima (drummer) played with Ronny Wakamats & Michel Hammer in a side project called R.U.G. (Randy Uchida Group), which released one vinyl EP titled ‚ÄúDeathly Fighter‚Äù in 1984. Uchida died in 2001 of cancer. Kiichi Takahashi (bassist) was the vocalist for the occult heavy metal band Sabbrabells. Cloudy (original bassist) played bass for female-fronted speed metal band Front Guerrilla, which released an EP titled Fight Back in 1986. Ironfist Tatushima (drummer) continues to play in the bands Die You Bastard! and Crow, which he had been playing with prior to GISM. Kaori Komura (original drummer) is an improviser using Korean percussion. She released an duo CD with Kazumoto Endo titled \\"In The Cave\\" in 2020. P.O.W. magazine During the mid 80s, Sakevi published a Japanese punkzine titled P.O.W. The acronym of P.O.W. initially stood for Punk On Wave, but then changed to Performance Of War for the third, final issue. The magazine promoted local punk bands from the Tokyo scene at the time. Sakevi also personally interviewed the Tokyo Medical Examiners Office, wrote the P.L.O., and wrote prisoners of war from Anti Japanese Armed Fronts by asking them all their opinions on death, included vivid instructions on different ways to kill people and showed vivid drawings on how ABC weapons are made with images of their horrific consequences. John Duncan, the guest-editor for the magazine, stated in the introduction of the third issue that Sakevi attacked a salaryman for staring with a makeshift flamethrower on a Tokyo commuter train, subsequently landing him in prison.

Bunched logic provides primitives for reasoning about resource composition, which aid in the compositional analysis of computer and other systems. It has category-theoretic and truth-functional semantics which can be understood in terms of an abstract concept of resource, and a proof theory in which the contexts Œì in an entailment judgement Œì ‚ä¢ A are tree-like structures (bunches) rather than lists or (multi)sets as in most proof calculi. Bunched logic has an associated type theory, and its first application was in providing a way to control the aliasing and other forms of interference in imperative programs. The logic has seen further applications in program verification, where it is the basis of the assertion language of separation logic, and in systems modelling, where it provides a way to decompose the resources used by components of a system.  Foundations  The deduction theorem of classical logic relates conjunction and implication: ::A \\\\wedge B \\\\vdash C \\\\quad \\\\mbox{iff} \\\\quad A \\\\vdash B \\\\Rightarrow C Bunched logic has two versions of the deduction theorem: ::A * B \\\\vdash C \\\\quad \\\\mbox{iff} \\\\quad A \\\\vdash B {-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!*} C \\\\qquad \\\\mbox{and also} \\\\qquad A \\\\wedge B \\\\vdash C \\\\quad \\\\mbox{iff} \\\\quad A \\\\vdash B \\\\Rightarrow C A * B and B {-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!*} C are forms of conjunction and implication that take resources into account (explained below). In addition to these connectives bunched logic has a formula, sometimes written I or emp, which is the unit of *. In the original version of bunched logic \\\\wedge and \\\\Rightarrow were the connectives from intuitionistic logic, while a boolean variant takes \\\\wedge and \\\\Rightarrow (and eg ) as from traditional boolean logic. Thus, bunched logic is compatible with constructive principles, but is in no way dependent on them. =Truth-functional Semantics (resource semantics)= The easiest way to understand these formulae is in terms of its truth-functional semantics. In this semantics a formula is true or false with respect to given resources. A*B asserts that the resource at hand can be decomposed into resources that satisfy A and B. B {-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!*} C says that if we compose the resource at hand with additional resource that satisfies B, then the combined resource satisfies C. \\\\wedge and \\\\Rightarrow have their familiar meanings. The foundation for this reading of formulae was provided by a forcing semantics r \\\\models A advanced by Pym, where the forcing relation means \`A holds of resource r\`. The semantics is analogous to Kripke's semantics of intuitionistic or modal logic, but where the elements of the model are regarded as resources which can be composed and decomposed, rather than as possible worlds that are accessible from one another. For example, the forcing semantics for the conjunction is of the form ::r \\\\models A * B \\\\quad \\\\mbox{iff} \\\\quad \\\\exists r_Ar_B.\\\\,r_A \\\\models A,\\\\, r_B \\\\models B,\\\\,\\\\mbox{and}\\\\,r_A \\\\bullet r_B \\\\leq r where r_A \\\\bullet r_B is a way of combining resources and \\\\leq is a relation of approximation. This semantics of bunched logic draws on prior work in Relevant Logic (especially the operational semantics of Routley-Meyer), but differs from it by not requiring r \\\\bullet r \\\\leq r and by accepting the semantics of standard intuitionistic or classical versions of \\\\wedge and \\\\Rightarrow . The property r \\\\bullet r \\\\leq r is justified when thinking about relevance but denied by considerations of resource; having two copies of a resource is not the same as having one, and in some models (e.g. heap models) r \\\\bullet r might not even be defined. The standard semantics of \\\\Rightarrow (or of negation) is often rejected by relevantists in their bid to escape the \`paradoxes of material implication', which are not a problem from the perspective of modelling resources and so not rejected by bunched logic. The semantics is also related to the 'phase semantics' of linear logic, but again is differentiated by accepting the standard (even boolean) semantics of \\\\wedge and \\\\Rightarrow which in linear logic is rejected in a bid to be constructive. These considerations are discussed in detail in an article on Resource semantics by Pym, O'Hearn and Yang. =Categorical semantics (doubly closed categories)= The double version of the deduction theorem of bunched logic has a corresponding category-theoretic structure. Proofs in intuitionistic logic can be interpreted in cartesian closed categories, that is, categories with finite products satisfying the (natural in A and C) adjunction correspondence relating hom sets: ::Hom(A \\\\wedge B, C) \\\\quad \\\\mbox{is isomorphic to} \\\\quad Hom(A, B \\\\Rightarrow C) Bunched logic can be interpreted in categories possessing two such structures ::a categorical model of bunched logic is a single category possessing two closed structures, one symmetric monoidal closed the other cartesian closed. A host of categorial models can be given using Day's tensor product construction. Additionally, implicational fragment of bunched logic has been given a games semantics. =Algebraic semantics= The algebraic semantics of bunched logic is a special case of its categorical semantics, but is simple to state and can be more approachable. ::an algebraic model of bunched logic is a poset which is a Heyting algebra and which carries an additional commutative residuated lattice structure (for the same lattice as the Heyting algebra): that is, an ordered commutative monoid with an associated implication satisfying A * B \\\\leq C \\\\quad \\\\mbox{iff} \\\\quad A \\\\leq B {-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!*} C. The boolean version of bunched logic has models as follows. ::an algebraic model of boolean bunched logic is a poset which is a Boolean algebra and which carries an additional residuated commutative monoid structure. =Proof theory and type theory (bunches)= The proof calculus of bunched logic differs from usual sequent calculi in having a tree-like context of hypotheses instead of a flat list-like structure. In its sequent-based proof theories, the context \\\\Delta in an entailment judgement \\\\Delta \\\\vdash A is a tree whose leaves are propositions and whose internal nodes are labelled with modes of composition corresponding to the two conjunctions. The two combining operators, comma and semicolon, are used (for instance) in the introduction rules for the two implications. :\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma,A \\\\vdash B}{\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash A{-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!*} B} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma;A \\\\vdash B}{\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash A{\\\\Rightarrow} B} The difference between the two composition rules comes from additional rules that apply to them. * Multiplicative composition \\\\Delta , \\\\Gamma denies the structural rules of weakening and contraction. * Additive composition \\\\Delta ; \\\\Gamma admits weakening and contraction of entire bunches. The structural rules and other operations on bunches are often applied deep within a tree-context, and not only at the top level: it is thus in a sense a calculus of deep inference. Corresponding to bunched logic is a type theory having two kinds of function type. Following the Curry‚ÄìHoward correspondence, introduction rules for implications correspond to introduction rules for function types. :\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma,x:A \\\\vdash M:B}{\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash \\\\lambda x.M: A{-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!*} B} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma;x:A \\\\vdash M: B}{\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash \\\\alpha x.M:A{\\\\Rightarrow} B} Here, there are two distinct binders, \\\\lambda and \\\\alpha, one for each kind of function type. The proof theory of bunched logic has an historical debt to the use of bunches in Relevance logic. But the bunched structure can in a sense be derived from the categorical and algebraic semantics: to formulate an introduction rule for {-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!*} we should mimick * on the left in sequents, and to introduce \\\\Rightarrow we should mimick \\\\wedge . This consideration leads to the use of two combining operators. James Brotherston has done further significant work on a unified proof theory for bunched logic and variants, employing Belnap's notion of display logic. Galmiche, M√©ry, and Pym have provided a comprehensive treatment of bunched logic, including completeness and other meta-theory, based on labelled tableaux.  Applications  = Interference control = In perhaps the first use of substructural type theory to control resources, John C. Reynolds showed how to use an affine type theory to control aliasing and other forms of interference in Algol-like programming languages. O'Hearn used bunched type theory to extend Reynolds system by allowing interference and non-interference to be more flexibly mixed. This resolved open problems concerning recursion and jumps in Reynolds's system. = Separation logic = Separation logic is an extension of Hoare logic which facilitates reasoning about mutable data structures that use pointers. Following Hoare logic the formulae of separation logic are of the form \\\\\\\\{Pre\\\\\\\\} program \\\\\\\\{Post\\\\\\\\}, but the preconditions and postconditions are formulae interpreted in a model of bunched logic. The original version of the logic was based on models as follows: * Heaps = L \\\\rightharpoonup_f V \\\\qquad (finite partial functions from locations to values) * h_0 \\\\bullet h_1 = union of heaps with disjoint domains, undefined when domains overlap. It is the undefinedness of the composition on overlapping heaps that models the separation idea. This is a model of the boolean variant of bunched logic. Separation logic was used originally to prove sequential programs, but then was extended to concurrency using a proof rule : \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\{P_1\\\\\\\\} C_1 \\\\\\\\{Q_1\\\\\\\\} \\\\quad \\\\\\\\{P_2\\\\\\\\} C_2 \\\\\\\\{Q_2\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\\\\\{P_1 * P_2\\\\\\\\} C_1 \\\\parallel C_2 \\\\\\\\{Q_1 * Q_2\\\\\\\\}} that divides the storage accessed by parallel threads. Later, the greater generality of the resource semantics was utilized: an abstract version of separation logic works for Hoare triples where the preconditions and postconditions are formulae interpreted over an arbitrary partial commutative monoid instead of a particular heap model. By suitable choice of commutative monoid, it was surprisingly found that the proofs rules of abstract versions of concurrent separation logic could be used to reason about interfering concurrent processes, for example by encoding rely-guarantee and trace-based reasoning. Separation logic is the basis of a number of tools for automatic and semi-automatic reasoning about programs, and is used in the Infer program analyzer currently deployed at Facebook. = Resources and processes = Bunched logic has been used in connection with the (synchronous) resource-process calculus SCRP in order to give a (modal) logic which characterizes, in the sense of Hennessey-Milner, the compositional structure of concurrent systems. SCRP is notable for interpreting A * B in terms of both parallel composition of systems and composition of their associated resources. The semantic clause of SCRP's process logic that corresponds to separation logic's rule for concurrency asserts that a formula A * B is true in resource-process state R , E just in case there are decompositions of the resource R = S \\\\bullet T and process E ~ F \\\\times G, where ~ denotes bisimulation, such that A is true in the resource-process state S , F and B is true in the resource-process state T , G ; that is R , E \\\\models A iff S , F \\\\models A and T , G \\\\models B . The system SCRP is based directly on bunched logic's resource semantics; that is, on ordered monoids of resource elements. While direct and intuitively appealing, this choice leads to a specific technical problem: the Hennessy-Milner completeness theorem holds only for fragments of the modal logic that exclude the multiplicative implication and multiplicative modalities. This problem is solved by basing resource-process calculus on a resource semantics in which resource elements are combined using two combinators, one corresponding to concurrent composition and one corresponding to choice. = Spatial logics = Cardelli, Caires, Gordon and others have investigated a series of logics of process calculi, where a conjunction is interpreted in terms of parallel composition. [References, to add] Unlike the work of Pym et al. in SCRP, they do not distinguish between parallel composition of systems and composition of resources accessed by the systems. Their logics are based on instances of the resource semantics which give rise to models of the boolean variant of bunched logic. Although these logics give rise to instances of boolean bunched logic, they appear to have been arrived at independently, and in any case have significant additional structure in the way of modalities and binders. Related logics have been proposed as well for modelling XML data.

McAlmon, as his signature name, March 9, 1895 ‚Äì February 2, 1956) was an American author, poet and publisher.Biography of McAlmon. Life McAlmon was born in Clifton, Kansas, the youngest of 10 children of an itinerant Presbyterian minister. He died in Desert Hot Springs, California, at the age of 60. McAlmon was admitted to the University of Minnesota in 1916, but only spent one semester there before enlisting in the United States Army Air Corps in 1918. At the conclusion of World War I, he returned to university (1917‚Äì1920), this time at the University of Southern California. He attended classes intermittently until 1920, when he moved to Chicago and then New York City, where he worked as a nude model at art school. Once in New York, he collaborated with William Carlos Williams on the Contact Review, which did not last for long, but published poetry by Ezra Pound, Wallace Stevens, Marianne Moore, H. D. (Hilda Doolittle), Kay Boyle and Marsden Hartley. The next year, he moved to Paris after marrying the wealthy and lesbian English writer Annie Winifred Ellerman, better known as Bryher. McAlmon typed and edited the handwritten manuscript of Ulysses by James Joyce, with whom he had a friendship. McAlmon became a prolific writer after the move, with many of his stories and poems based on his experiences as a youth in South Dakota. Contact editions Having published his book of short stories A Hasty Bunch with James Joyce's printer Maurice Daranti√®re in Dijon in 1922, he founded the Contact Publishing Company in 1923 using his father-in-law's money. Lasting until 1929, Contact Editions brought out books by Bryher (Two Selves), H. D.'s Palimpsest, Mina Loy's Lunar Baedecker, Ernest Hemingway's first book Three Stories & Ten Poems (1923), poems by Marsden Hartley, William Carlos Williams (Spring and All, 1923), Emanuel Carnevali's only book during his lifetime (The Hurried Man), prose by Ford Madox Ford, Gertrude Stein (The Making of Americans, 1925), Mary Butts (Ashe of Rings), John Herrmann (What Happens), Edwin Lanham (Sailors Don't Care), Robert Coates (The Eater of Darkness), Texas schoolteacher Gertrude Beasley's My First Thirty Years and Saikaku Ihara's Quaint Tales of Samurais. McAlmon paid for the publication of The Ladies Almanack by Djuna Barnes. One of McAlmon's most important and best-received works is Village: As It Happened Through a Fifteen Year Period (1924) which presents a bleak portrait of an American town. The book shows his love for Eugene Vidal (Eugene Collins in the book), Gore Vidal's father, with whom he grew up in Madison, South Dakota, which is documented in Gore Vidal's mid-90s memoir, Palimpsest. Other works include the short story collection A Companion Volume (1923), the autobiographical novel Post-Adolescence (1923), Distinguished Air (Grim Fairy Tales) (1925), the poetry collections The Portrait of a Generation (1926) and Not Alone Lost (1937), the 1,200 line epic poem North America, Continent of Conjecture (1929), and his memoir Being Geniuses Together: An Autobiography (1938). McAlmon returned to the United States in 1940, residing in El Paso, Texas, where he sought treatment for a pulmonary ailment. He died at Desert Hot Springs, California, almost unknown in his native country sixteen years later. In the 1990s, Edward Lorusso brought out three volumes of McAlmon's fiction (many were first American publications), Village (1924, 1990), Post- Adolescence (1923, 1991), and Miss Knight and Others (1992), all through University of New Mexico Press. McAlmon is heavily featured in the book Memoirs of Montparnasse by John Glassco about the golden age of Paris in the 1920s when writers and artists flocked to the city. His social circle and friendship with Ernest Hemingway is discussed in the novel The Paris Wife by Paula McLain. In 2007, his fictionalized memoir The Nightinghouls of Paris was published, based on the experiences of Glassco and his friend Graeme Taylor with McAlmon in Paris. The previously unpublished book was based on a typescript held by Yale's archives. An epistolary novel about McMalmon and his expatriate adventures and final years in California, Letters from Oblivion, was published by Edward Lorusso in 2014.

History The first Round Table was formed in Norwich, England in 1927. The founder was a young member of Norwich Rotary Club who felt there was a need for a club aimed more at the younger businessmen of the town. His vision was for them to exchange ideas, learn from the experiences of their colleagues, and together contribute to the civic life of the town. In the following year, interest was so high that the club attracted 85 members, and people around the country were starting to show an interest in establishing other clubs. The second Round Table club opened soon after in Portsmouth. By the time the Second World War broke out in 1939 there were 125 clubs and 4,600 members. The first overseas group was formed in Copenhagen in 1936, and while the movement continued to grow in Denmark, the war years halted British expansion for a while. Today, in the United Kingdom, there are 600 local Round Tables, with a combined membership of close to 4000. The Round Table is now an international movement, with active members in most European countries, as well as Africa, the Middle East, India, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and the USA. Logo The Winchester Round Table Round Table has no direct connection to Arthurian Round Table. The design of the Round Table emblem or rondel (see right) is, however, an adaptation of the one which hangs in the Great Hall in Winchester Castle. Although this is claimed to be the Round Table of the mythical court of King Arthur, it is in fact a representation which was made in the 13th century, and painted in its current form on the order of Henry VIII. The Round Table Family The Round Table Family of clubs consists of four clubs. Round Table, Ladies Circle, 41 Club and Tangent. In 1932 the wives of Tablers set up their own social networking and charitable fundraising organisation - Ladies Circle. This was founded by and for wives of Tablers, however is now open to all women aged 18 to 45. Retiring Round Tablers have their own club, 41 Club. Similarly, retiring Circlers have Tangent & Agora(clubs), although Tangent is, but Agora is not, officially part of the Round Table Family of clubs. Activities =Socialising= The association promotes fellowship amongst young professional and business men. Members of a Round Table club meet on a regular basis, normally once a fortnight. Round Table clubs within the UK are grouped into \\"Areas\\", and clubs meet every three months for both social and charitable Area gatherings. =Community work= Round Table is frequently associated with its charitable fund raising activities and community service projects, which can either be requests for assistance or a project initiated by the club itself. In the UK, many Round Table clubs operate these activities through charitable trusts but who receives these funds is agreed upon by the clubs members. Many clubs organise community events during the year, for example Bonfire & Firework Nights or ‚ÄòSanta‚Äôs Sleigh‚Äôat Christmas.

The first Round Table Pizza restaurant was opened in 1959, and the company has over 400 restaurants. The company is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Overview The company currently operates two formats. Traditional Round Table Pizza restaurants serve primarily pizza, salads, and beverages. A new format, Round Table Pizza Clubhouse - Pizza Pub Play, features expanded entertainment with arcade games for children and big-screen TVs with sports programming, as well as an expanded menu and craft beer selection.  History  William R. Larson (January 30th, 1933 - November 15, 2006) was born in San Jose, California on January 30, 1933, and was raised in Palo Alto, California. After serving 4 years in the military, Larson worked several different jobs, gaining experience that ultimately led him to create his own restaurant. He opened his first pizza parlor in Menlo Park, California on December 21, 1959 located at 1235 El Camino Real. He called his new restaurant Round Table Pizza. This original location would eventually be moved to 1225 El Camino Real a few years later where it still stands today, and is owned and operated by Bob Larson, William's son. He named the restaurant Round Table Pizza after the round redwood tables he and his father constructed. According to PizzaMarketPlace.com, \\"William's developed recipe & crust soon brought Round Table Pizza a strong following from customers and entrepreneurs.\\" By 1978 under Larson's direction, Round Table had amassed over 225 stores. In 2011, the company filed for protection under Chapter 11 with the U.S. bankruptcy court and emerged from bankruptcy the same year. The Consensual Plan of Reorganization provides for 100% repayment of obligations to its secured and unsecured creditors and for its employee owners to retain 100% ownership of the company. Since then, the company met all obligations and its financial strength steadily improved with the retirement of debt and the increase in cash flow. In 2014, the company signed a 35-store development agreement to build restaurants in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, and Qatar. As of 2016, more than 450 franchised and company-owned locations were in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. Round Table Pizza had seven branches in Dubai and additional locations in Bahrain and Mongolia at this time.. On September 15, 2017, Round Table Pizza announced that it was acquired by Global Franchise Group. In the same month, Round Table Pizza closed all seven branches in Dubai. In 2019, Round Table Pizza rebranded on its 60th anniversary, including a new logo and a new motto \\"Pizza Royalty\\". The chain also expanded to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex for the first time in 2019 with new locations in Frisco, Texas and near the Southern Methodist University campus in University Park. Marketing Updated Version of the original Round Table Pizza logo designed by William R. Larson. William Larson penned the slogan for Round Table \\"share a little pizza with someone you love.\\" This was later changed to \\"The Last Honest Pizza.\\" In 1961, a friend of Larson's drew some sketches of members of King Arthur's court eating pizza, and Mr. Larson then adopted the King Arthur theme for his restaurants.Company website. Retrieved January 12, 2007. The three banners in the official logo were added in 1970, and are intended to symbolize the letters \\"F-U-N\\".

He is known for being the first to develop successful balloon angioplasty for expanding lumens of narrowed arteries. He was born in Dresden. Early life Andreas Roland Gruentzig was born in Dresden, Germany on June 25, 1939, shortly before the start of World War II. His father, Dr. Wilmar Gruentzig (1902‚Äì1945), was a secondary-school science teacher with a Ph.D. in chemistry. Wilmar was conscripted into the meteorological service of the Luftwaffe during World War II. He presumably died during the war. His mother was Charlotta (n√©e Zeugner) Gruentzig (1907-1955) and a teacher. His older brother was Johannes Gruentzig. After his birth in Dresden, in 1940 the family moved to the house of a relative in the small town of Rochlitz in western Saxony. After the war, Charlotta and her sons moved to Leipzig along with her sister Alfreda Beier and her mother. In 1950, Charlotta moved her family to Buenos Aires, Argentina to live with her husband's brother and wife. Unhappy and homesick Charlotta and her two sons moved back to Leipzig two years later. Gruentzig and his brother Johannes entered high school at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. Gruetzig graduated from the Thomasschule in 1957 with highest honors. In 1956, his brother Johannes fled across the border to Hanover. Gruentzig followed a year later.Monagan, David and David O. Williams. Journey into the Heart: A Tale of Pioneering Doctors and Their Race to Transform Cardiovascular Medicine. New York: Gotham Books, February 1, 2007.Matthias B; Gruentzig J, Husmann M, Rosch J. Balloon angrioplasty - the legacy of Andreas Gruentzig, M.D. (1939-1985). Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine (2014) 1(15). Gruentzig studied at Bunsen Gymnasium while his brother enrolled as a medical student at Heidelberg University. Gruentzig began his medical studies at Heidelberg University in the fall of 1958 subsequently graduating on April 8, 1964. He then rotated through a series of internships in Mannheim, Hanover, Bad Harzburg, and Ludwigshafen. His studies included internal medicine and vascular surgery. In 1966 Gruentzig returned to Heidelberg University to take on a staff assistant job at the university's Institute for Social and Occupational Medicine investigating risk factors for cardiovascular disease, chronic bronchitis, and liver degeneration. In 1967, he departed for a six-month paid fellowship to study epidemiology at the University of London School of Hygiene. In 1968 he returned to Heidelberg. Early in 1968 he left for a six-month assistant doctor's job in Darmstadt at the Max Ratschow Clinic. In November 1969, Gruentzig and his future wife Michaela moved to Zurich where he worked in the department of Angiology at the University Hospital of Zurich. Angioplasties In the late 1960s, Gruentzig learned of the angioplasty procedure developed by Charles Dotter, an American, at a lecture in Frankfurt, Germany. Encountering bureaucratic resistance in Germany to his exploration of angioplasty techniques, Gruentzig moved to Switzerland in 1969.http://www.emoryhealthcare.org/heart-center-atlanta/history/andreas- gruentzig.html Gruentzig's first successful coronary angioplasty treatment on an awake human was performed on 16 September 1977, in Zurich, Switzerland. He expanded a short, about 3 mm, non-branching section of the Left Anterior Descending (LAD) artery (the front branch of the left coronary artery) which supplies the front wall and tip of the heart (see coronary circulation) which had a high grade stenosis, about 80%, of the lumen. Gruentzig presented the results of his first four angioplasty cases at the 1977 American Heart Association (AHA) meeting, which led to widespread acknowledgement of his pioneering work. The immediate results of this treatment, despite using only a carefully kitchen built catheter (crude by current standards), were quite good. The patient became and remained angina free after this treatment. This initial patient's result was electively rechecked, by angiography at Emory University, on the 10-year anniversary of the initial treatment. The LAD narrowing, after this 10-year timespan, remained almost perfectly expanded. There was minimal residual narrowing, probably less than 10%, as seen in similar angle and multiple different views comparing with photographs of the original, 10 years earlier, before and after results. The excellent results of this initial and subsequent patients were critical to the rapid development and growing acceptance of the angioplasty treatment option. Gruentzig recognized multiple important issues early: (a) the treatment would not be readily accepted by most physicians, especially bypass surgeons, (b) it could easily lead to bad outcomes without great care in selection of which patients/lesions to treat and of the treating physicians, and (c) it required careful teaching of the technique and its potential difficulties and pitfalls to other physicians, so as to proactively reduce the occurrence of poor results. Understanding these issues and tireless effort on his part are widely recognized in cardiology for being of fundamental importance to the ultimate success of the technique. By about 1990, lumen stenosis of the coronary arteries was more commonly treated by the angioplasty technique than by coronary artery bypass surgery. This treatment approach is now referred to as plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA). In the 1990s, further major improvements, both immediate and especially long term became possible with better understanding of disease as a result of clinical research trials using IVUS and the development of stents to mechanically support POBA results. Since the later 1990s, most angioplasties also involve a stent over the angioplasty balloon; the balloon is hydraulically expanded, typically at 6‚Äì25 atmospheres of internal pressure, then deflated and removed while the stent remains behind to mechanically support the lumen remaining in the new, more open shape as created by the hydraulically expanded balloon. Gruentzig's success remains a major breakthrough and great contribution to the field of medicine in demonstrating that doctors could work inside of the arteries safely, without the need for open surgery. By utilizing the arterial circulation as a \\"therapeutic highway\\", many types of devices and drugs can now be delivered directly to the heart, kidneys, carotid arteries, brain, legs and aorta without the need for major surgery and general anesthesia. Personal life Gruentzig fathered an out-of-wedlock daughter named Katrin Hoffman in 1967. Around the same time, Gruentzig met Michaela (n√©e Seebrunner) Gruentzig.

Watson and published in 1968. It has earned both critical and public praise, along with continuing controversy about credit for the Nobel award and attitudes towards female scientists at the time of the discovery. Significance Watson is a U.S. molecular biologist, geneticist and zoologist, best known as one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA in 1953 with Francis Crick. In 1998, the Modern Library placed The Double Helix at number 7 on its list of the 100 best nonfiction books of the 20th century. In 2012, The Double Helix was named as one of the 88 \\"Books That Shaped America\\" by the Library of Congress. Though an important book about an immensely important subject, it was and remains a controversial account. Though it was originally slated to be published by Harvard University Press, Watson's home university, Harvard dropped the arrangement after protestations from Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, and it was published instead by Atheneum in the United States and Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the UK. The intimate first-person memoir about scientific discovery was unusual for its time. The book has been hailed for its highly personal view of scientific work, though has been criticised as caring only about the glory of priority and the author is claimed to be willing to appropriate data from others surreptitiously in order to obtain it. It has also been criticized as being disagreeably sexist towards Rosalind Franklin, another participant in the discovery, who was deceased by the time Watson's book was written. The events described in the book were dramatized in a BBC television program Life Story (known as The Race for the Double Helix in the U.S.).  Criticism  A 1980 Norton Critical Edition of The Double Helix edited by Gunther Stent, analyzed the events surrounding its initial publication. It presents a selection of both positive and negative reviews of the book, by such figures as Philip Morrison, Richard Lewontin, Alex Comfort, Jacob Bronowski, and more in-depth analyses by Peter Medawar, Robert K. Merton, and Andre Lwoff. Erwin Chargaff declined permission to reprint his unsympathetic review from the March 29, 1968, issue of Science, but letters in response from Max Perutz, Maurice Wilkins, and Watson are printed. Also included are retrospectives from a 1974 edition of Nature written by Francis Crick and Linus Pauling, and an analysis of Franklin's work by her student Aaron Klug. The Norton edition concludes with the 1953 papers on DNA structure as published in Nature. In the book Rosalind Franklin and DNA, author Anne Sayre is very critical of Watson's account. She claims that Watson's book did not give a balanced description of Rosalind Franklin and the nature of her interactions with Maurice Wilkins at King's College, London. Sayre's book raises doubts about the ethics of how Watson and Crick used some of Franklin's results and whether adequate credit was given to her. Watson had very limited contact with Franklin during the time she worked on DNA. By providing more information about Franklin's life than was included in Watson's book, it was possible for Sayre to provide a different perspective on the role Franklin played in Watson and Crick's discovery of the double helix structure of DNA. (See: King's College (London) DNA Controversy) In the book's preface, Watson explains that he is describing his impressions at the time of the events, and not at the time he wrote the book. In the epilogue Watson writes; \\"Since my initial impressions about [Franklin], both scientific and personal (as recorded in the early pages of this book) were often wrong I want to say something here about her achievements.\\" He goes on to describe her superb work, and, despite this, the enormous barriers she faced as a woman in the field of science. He also acknowledged that it took years to overcome their bickering before he could appreciate Franklin's generosity and integrity.  An annotated and illustrated edition  An annotated and illustrated version of the book, edited by Alex Gann and Jan Witkowski, was published in November 2012 by Simon & Schuster in association with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. The new edition coincided with the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the 1962 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine to Francis Crick, James D. Watson and Maurice Wilkins. It contains over three hundred annotations on the events and characters portrayed, with facsimile letters and contemporary photographs, many previously unpublished. Their sources include newly discovered correspondence from Crick, the papers of Franklin, Pauling, and Wilkins, and they include a chapter dropped from the original edition that described Watson's holiday in the Italian Alps in 1952. The edition was favorably reviewed in The New York Times by Nicholas Wade who commented, \\"anyone seeking to understand modern biology and genomics could do much worse than start with the discovery of the structure of DNA, on which almost everything else is based. This edition includes several appendices, including letters by Crick and Watson giving the first account of the discovery, a previously unpublished chapter, an account of the controversy surrounding the publication, and the unsympathetic review by the late Erwin Chargaff from the March 29, 1968, issue of Science, which he previously declined permission to reprint in the 1980 Norton Critical Edition of The Double Helix edited by Gunther Stent. The book does not include the four press cuttings from the News Chronicle, Varsity and The New York Times (2) of May and June 1953 regarding the discovery of the structure of DNA, and Crick's letter of 13th April 1967 is incomplete. Film adaptation In 1987, the memoir was adapted as a 107-minute television docudrama called Life Story for the BBC, airing on Horizon, the long-running British documentary television series on BBC Two that covers science and philosophy. The script was written by William Nicholson, and it was produced and directed by Mick Jackson. Jeff Goldblum starred as Watson, with Tim Pigott-Smith as Francis Crick, Juliet Stevenson as Rosalind Franklin, and Alan Howard as Maurice Wilkins. The film won several awards in the UK and U.S., including the 1988 BAFTA TV Award as the Best Single Drama. Notes References *James D.

Ewen Cameron or Ewen Cameron ‚Äì was a Scottish-born psychiatrist who served as President of the American Psychiatric Association (1952‚Äì1953), Canadian Psychiatric Association (1958‚Äì1959), American Psychopathological Association (1963), Society of Biological Psychiatry (1965) and World Psychiatric Association (1961‚Äì1966). In spite of his high professional reputation, he has been criticized for, among other things, administering electroconvulsive therapy and experimental drugs, including poisons such as curare, to patients and prisoners without their informed consent, and his role in the history of the development of psychological and medical torture techniques. Some of this work took place in the context of the Project MKUltra program for the developing of mind control and torture techniques, psychoactive poisons, and behavior modification systems. Decades after his own death, the psychic driving technique he developed continued to see extensive use in the torture of prisoners around the world. Cameron is the subject of Stephen Bennett's film Eminent Monsters (2020), which was funded by BBC Scotland and Creative Scotland.Bennett, Stephen (2020), When men become monsters, Seven Days, Sunday National, 29 March 2020 pp. 1-2 Early life and career Donald Ewen Cameron was born in Bridge of Allan, Scotland, the oldest son of a Presbyterian minister. He received an M.B., Ch.B. in psychological medicine at the University of Glasgow in 1924, a D.P.M. from the University of London in 1925, and an M.D. with distinction from the University in 1936. Cameron began his training in psychiatry at the Glasgow Royal Mental Hospital in 1925. In 1926, he served as assistant medical officer there and was introduced to psychiatrist Sir David Henderson, a student of Swiss-born US psychiatrist Adolf Meyer. He continued his training in the United States under Meyer at the Phipps Clinic, Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland from 1926 to 1928 with a Henderson Research Scholarship. In 1928, Cameron left Baltimore for the Burgh√∂lzli, the psychiatric hospital of the University of Zurich, in Switzerland, where he studied under Hans W. Maier, the successor of Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, who had significantly influenced psychiatric thinking. There he met A. T. Mathers, Manitoba's principal psychiatrist, who convinced Cameron in 1929 to move to Brandon, the second largest city of Manitoba, Canada. Cameron stayed there for seven years and was made physician-in-charge of the Reception Unit of the Provincial Mental Hospital. He also organized the structure of mental health services in the western half of the province, establishing 10 functioning clinics; this model was used as the blueprint for similar efforts in Montreal and a forerunner of 1960s community health models. In 1933, he married Jean C. Rankine, whom he had met while they were students at the University of Glasgow. She was a former captain of the Scottish field hockey team, a competitive tennis player, and lecturer in mathematics at the University of Glasgow. They had four children; a daughter and three sons. In 1936, he moved to Massachusetts to become director of the research division at Worcester State Hospital only 1 year later. In 1936, he also published his first book, Objective and Experimental Psychiatry which introduced his belief that psychiatry should approach the study of human behavior in a rigorous, scientific fashion rooted in biology. His theories of behavior stressed the unity of the organism with the environment; the book also outlined experimental method and research design. Cameron believed firmly in clinical psychiatry and a strict scientific method. In 1938 he moved to Albany, New York, where he received his diplomate in psychiatry and thus was certified in psychiatry. From 1939 to 1943 he was professor of neurology and psychiatry at Albany Medical College, and at the Russell Sage School of Nursing, also in the Albany area. During those years, Cameron began to expand on his thoughts about the interrelationships of mind and body, developing a reputation as a psychiatrist who could bridge the gap between the organic, structural neurologists, and the psychiatrists whose knowledge of anatomy was limited to maps of the mind as opposed to maps of the brain. Through his instruction of nurses and psychiatrists he became an authority in his areas of concentration. Cameron focused primarily on biological descriptive psychiatry and applied the British and European schools and models of the practice. Cameron followed these schools in demanding that mental disturbances are diseases and somatic in nature; all psychological illness would therefore be hardwired, a product of the body and the direct result of a patient's biological structure rather than caused by social environments. Characteristics were thus diagnosed as syndromes emerging from the brain. It is at this juncture that he became interested with how he could effectively manipulate the brain to control and understand the processes of memory. He furthermore wanted to understand the problems of memory caused by aging, believing that the aged brain suffered from psychosis. In 1943, Cameron was invited to McGill University in Montreal by neurosurgeon Dr Wilder Penfield. With a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, money from John Wilson McConnell of the Montreal Star, and a gift of Sir Hugh Allan's mansion on Mount Royal, the Allan Memorial Institute for psychiatry was founded. Cameron became the first director of the Allan Memorial Institute as well as the first chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at McGill. He recruited psychoanalysts, social psychiatrists and biologists globally to develop the psychiatry program at McGill From its beginning in 1943, the Allan Memorial Institute was run on an \\"open door\\" basis, allowing patients to leave if they wished, as opposed to the \\"closed door\\" policy of other hospitals in Canada in the early 1940s. In 1946, Cameron introduced the practice of the day hospital, the first of its kind in North America, permitting patients to remain at home while receiving treatment at the Institute during the day, thus avoiding unnecessary hospitalization and allowing the patients to maintain ties with their community and family.  Nuremberg trials  In 1945, Cameron, Nolan D. C. Lewis and Dr Paul L. Schroeder, colonel and psychiatrist, University College of Illinois, were invited to the Nuremberg trials for a psychiatric evaluation of Rudolf Hess. Their diagnosis was amnesia and hysteria per a short commentary in JAMA. Hess later confessed that he had faked the amnesia. Before his arrival in Nuremberg, Cameron had written The Social Reorganization of Germany, in which he argued that German culture and its individual citizens would have to be transformed and reorganized. In his analysis, German culture was made up of people who had the need for status, worshipped strict order and regimentation, desired authoritarian leadership and had a deeply ingrained fear of other countries. The paper stated that German culture and its people would have offspring bound to become a threat to world peace in 30 years. To prevent this, the West would have to take measures to reorganize German society. Other similar psychiatric diagnoses of Germany were published during this time.Paul Weindling. John W. Thompson: Psychiatrist in the Shadow of the Holocaust. University Rochester Press, 2010. p. 85. Cameron next published Nuremberg and Its Significance. In this, he hoped to establish a suitable method to reinstate a form of justice in Germany that could prevent its society from recreating the attitudes that led it from the Great War to World War II. Cameron viewed German society throughout history as continually giving rise to fearsome aggression. He came up with the idea that if he presented the world and confronted the Germans with the atrocities committed during the war, the world and the Germans would refrain from repeated acts of extreme aggression.; if the greater population of Germany saw the atrocities of World War II, they would surely submit to a re-organized system of justice. Cameron decided that Germans would be most likely to commit atrocities due to their historical, biological, racial and cultural past and their particular psychological nature. All Germans on trial would be assessed according to the likeliness for committing the crime. Cameron began to develop broader theories of society, new concepts of human relations to replace concepts he deemed dangerous and outdated. These became the basis of a new social and behavioural science that he would later institute through his presidencies of the Canadian, American and World Psychiatric Associations, the American Psychopathological Association and the Society of Biological Psychiatry. With the results of the Manhattan project, Cameron feared that without proper re-organization of society, atomic weapons could fall into the hands of new, fearsome aggressors.Father, Son and CIA by Harvey Weinstein p. 97. Cameron argued that it was necessary for behavioral scientists to act as the social planners of society, and that the United Nations could provide a conduit for implementing his ideas for applying psychiatric elements to global governance and politics. Cameron started to distinguish populations between \\"the weak\\" and \\"the strong\\". Those with anxieties or insecurities and who had trouble with the state of the world were labelled as \\"the weak\\"; in Cameron's analysis, they could not cope with life and had to be isolated from society by \\"the strong\\". The mentally ill were thus labelled as not only sick, but also weak. Cameron further argued that \\"the weak\\" must not influence children. He promoted a philosophy where chaos could be prevented by removing the weak from society.  Social and intrapsychic behaviour analysis  In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Cameron continued his work on memory and its relationship to aging. He published a book called Remembering and extended psychiatric links to human biology. In papers published during this time he linked RNA to memory. He furthered his diagnostic definitions of clinical states such as anxiety, depression and schizophrenia. He began to develop the discipline of social psychiatry which concentrated on the roles of interpersonal interaction, family, community and culture in the emergence and amelioration of emotional disturbance. Cameron placed the psychiatric treatment unit inside of the hospital and inspected its success. Here in the hospital Cameron could observe how the psychiatric patient resembled patients with other diseases that were not psychiatric in nature. In this manner, somatic causes could be compared. The behaviour of a mental patient could resemble the behaviour of a patient with, for example, syphilis, and then a somatic cause could be deduced for a psychological illness. Cameron titled this procedure \\"intrapsychic\\" (a term derived from the psycho-somatic relationship of hospital patients). Cameron began to abandon the Freudian unconscious in favour of a social constructivist's view of mental illness. In his analysis, culture and society played a crucial role in the ability for one to function according to the demands necessary for human survival. Therefore, society should function to select out the weak and unwanted, those apt towards fearsome aggression that threatened society. Psychiatry would play a disciplinary role. Cameron began to explore how industrial conditions could satisfy the population through work and what kind of person or worker is best suited to industrial conditions. A stronger personality would be able to maintain itself in heavy industrial situations, he theorised, while the weaker would not be able to cope with industrial conditions. Cameron would analyze what conditions produced the stronger worker, what would be the necessary conditions to replicate this personality and to reward the stronger while disciplining the weaker. In his 1946 paper entitled \\"Frontiers of Social Psychiatry\\", he used the case of World War II Germany as an example where society poisoned the minds of citizens by creating a general anxiety or neurosis.Father, Son and CIA by Harvey Weinstein p. 90  Cameron and Freud: civilization and discontents  Although Cameron rejected the Freudian notion of the unconscious, he shared the Freudian idea in that personal psychology is linked to the nervous nature. He theorized that attitudes and beliefs should reinforce the overall attitudes of the desired society. Like Freud, Cameron maintained that the family was the nucleus of social behavior and anxieties later in life were spawned during childhood. Cameron wanted to build an inventive psychiatric institution to determine rapid ways for societal control while demanding a psychological economy that did not center itself around guilt and guilt complexes. His focus on children included the rights to protection against outmoded, doctrinaire tactics, and the necessity for the implantation of taboos and inhibitions from their parents. Cameron wrote that mental illness was transmitted generationally; thus, the re-occurrence of mental illness could be stopped by remodeling and expanding existing concepts of marriage suitability, as well as the quarantine of mentally ill individuals from the general population. The only cure for mental illness, he theorized, was to eliminate its \\"carriers\\" from society altogether. Cameron believed that mental illness was literally contagious ‚Äì that if one came into contact with someone suffering from mental illness, one would begin to produce the symptoms of a mental disease. For example, something like rock music could be created by mentally ill people and would produce mentally ill people through infection, which in turn would be transmitted to the genes. Thus, this group would have to be studied and controlled as a contagious social disease. Police, hospitals, government, and schools would need to use the correct psychiatric authority to stop mental contagions from spreading. Cameron also hoped to generate families capable of using authority and techniques to take measures against mental illness, which would later be apparent in Cameron's MKULTRA and MKDELTA experiments.  Cameron and the Germans  In Cameron's book Life is For Living, published in 1948, he expressed a concern for the German race in general. Just as Sigrid Schultz stated in Germany will try it again, Cameron fostered a fear for Germans and their genetic determination. Those Germans affected by the events that led to World War II were of utmost concern. Cameron's concerns extended to his policies determining who should have children and advance to positions of authority. According to Cameron's psychiatric analysis of the German people, they were not suitable to have children or hold positions of authority because of a genetic tendency to organize society in a way that fostered fearsome aggression and would lead to war rather than peace; he would repeatedly use the German as the archetypal character structure on which to ground the most psychologically deviant humans.  Mental illness as a social contagion  Although society had established sanctions against the spread of infectious diseases, Cameron wanted to extend the concept of contagion to chronic anxiety. He warned that people with mental illnesses could spread and transmit their diseases. He warned that government institutions should take measures against such potential liabilities. Cameron began to base some of his notions on race, as is seen in his theories regarding the German people. In the late 1940s, Cameron presented his ideas in a lecture entitled Dangerous Men and Women. It describes various personalities that he believed were of marked danger to all members of society. The personality types are as follows: * A passive man who \\"is afraid to say what he really thinks\\" and \\"will stand anything, and stands for nothing\\". \\"[H]e was born in Munich, he is the eternal compromiser and his spiritual food is appeasement\\". * A possessive type, filled with jealousy and demanding utmost loyalty. This personality type poses a danger to those closest to them, especially children. * The insecure man ‚Äì \\"They are the driven crowds that makes the army of the authoritarian overlord; they are the stuffing of conservatism ... mediocrity is their god. They fear the stranger, they fear the new idea; they are afraid to live, and scared to die.\\" This third type needs conformity and obeys the dictates of society, adhering to a world of strict standards of right or wrong (which are manipulated by power groups to keep the insecure controlled and dependent). Cameron theorized that this type is dangerous because of its \\"lust for authority\\".Father, Son and CIA by Harvey Weinstein p. 101 * The last type is the psychopath, the greatest danger in times of political and societal upheaval; this Cameron labeled \\"the Gestapo\\". Cameron believed that a society in which psychiatry built and developed the institutions of government, schools, prisons and hospitals would be one in which science triumphed over the \\"sick\\" members of society. He demanded that political systems be watched, and that German people needed to be monitored due to their \\"personality type\\", which he claimed results in the conditions that give rise to the dictatorial power of an authoritarian overlord. Cameron stated, \\"Get it understood how dangerous these damaged, sick personalities are to ourselves ‚Äì and above all, to our children, whose traits are taking form and we shall find ways to put an end to them.\\" He spoke about Germans, but also to the larger portion of the society that resembled or associated with such traits. For Cameron, the traits were contagions and anyone affected by the societal, cultural or personality forms would themselves be infected. Cameron used his ideas to implement policies on who should govern and parent in society. The described types would have to be eliminated from society if there was to be peace and progress. The sick were, for Cameron, the viral infection to its stability and health. The described types were the enemies of society and life. Experts must develop methods of forcefully changing attitudes and beliefs to prevent the authoritarian overlord. MKULTRA Subproject 68 During the 1950s and 1960s, Cameron became involved in what has later become known as the MKUltra mind control program, which was covertly sponsored by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and which eventually led to the publication of the KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation manual. Cameron's work was funded under MKUltra's subproject 68. He is unrelated to another CIA psychiatrist, Alan S. Cameron, who helped pioneer psychological profiling of world leaders during the 1970s and was not associated with the behavioral modification research program. Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. He commuted from Albany to Montreal every week to work at McGill's Allan Memorial Institute and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 to carry out MKUltra experiments there, known as the Montreal experiments. In addition to LSD, he experimented with various paralytic drugs and electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power.\\"Inside Montreal's House Of Horrors\\" Montreal Gazette. January 21, 1984 His \\"psychic driving\\" experiments consisted of putting a subject into a drug-induced coma for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple statements. These experiments were typically carried out on patients who had entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postnatal depression; many suffered permanent debilitation after these treatments. Such consequences included incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents, and thinking their interrogators were their parents. His work was inspired and paralleled by the psychiatrist William Sargant, who was also involved with the intelligence services and experimented extensively on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage. Sid Taylor stated that Cameron used curare to immobilise his patients during his research. After one test he noted: \\"Although the patient was prepared by both prolonged sensory isolation (35 days) and by repeated depatterning, and although she received 101 days of positive driving, no favourable results were obtained.\\" Patients were tested in the Radio Telemetry Laboratory, which was built under Cameron's direction. Here, patients were exposed to a range of RF and electromagnetic signals and monitored for changes in behaviour. It was reported that none of the patients sent to the Radio Telemetry Lab showed any signs of improvement. In 1980, the Canadian investigative news program The Fifth Estate interviewed two former patients of Cameron's who were among several of his ex patients who were at that time suing the CIA for the long term effects of Cameron's treatment.\\"MK Ultra\\", The Fifth Estate, March 11, 1980 In her book, In the Sleep Room: The Story of the CIA Brainwashing Experiments in Canada, author Anne Collins explored the history of Cameron and Montreal's Allan Memorial Institute. This was made into a TV mini-series directed by Anne Wheeler in 1998, called The Sleep Room, which also dramatizes the lawsuit of Cameron's ex-patients against the CIA. Naomi Klein states in her book The Shock Doctrine that Cameron's research and his contribution to MKUltra were not about mind control and brainwashing, but \\"to design a scientifically based system for extracting information from 'resistant sources.' In other words, torture.\\"Klein, N., \\"The Shock Doctrine\\", p. 39, Metropolitan Books, New York, 2007 She then cites Alfred W.

It was originally developed by Altsys but is now owned by FontLab Ltd. History =Altsys Corporation= In December 1984, James R. Von Ehr II founded the Altsys Corporation to develop graphics applications for personal computers. The first foray by Altsys into commercial font editing software was a bitmap font editor called Fontastic, released in the mid-1980s for the Apple Macintosh. The program, developed by Altsys founder Von Ehr, was able to edit the native bitmap font format of the Mac. It introduced many of the interface elements that would carry over into Fontographer. Fontastic Plus was later introduced with new editing tools and kerning pairs. Fontographer, developed by von Ehr for the Mac and released in January 1986 ‚Äîbefore Adobe Illustrator‚Äî was the first commercially available B√©zier curve editing software for a personal computer. High quality fonts in the PostScript format could be developed for a fraction of the cost of all other existing methods (URW's Ikarus required systems costing over $100,000), leading to what has been called \\"the democratization of type design\\": for the first time in history, numerous self-taught type designers without substantial capital investment produced fonts for professional use. Fontographer 2.0 was released eight months later in the Fall of 1986. With the PostScript background established with Fontographer, Altsys developed FreeHand in 1988 as a Macintosh Postscript-based illustration program using B√©zier curves for drawing and editing. In 1989, Fontographer 3.0 was released, featuring an auto-trace tool and automatic generation of hints for Postscript printer fonts. =Macromedia= In January 1995 Altsys was acquired by Macromedia and both Fontographer and FreeHand were incorporated into the Macromedia product lineup. A new version of Fontographer was included in the Macromedia Graphics Suite, which helped its wider adoption. Although development of the font editor was frozen from 1991, when version 4.1 was released, until 2006, many font and graphics designers continued to use it. The only serious competitor at the time, FontLab (later FontLab Studio), was generally considered more difficult to use, although by 2005 it had overwhelmingly replaced Fontographer for most professional font development. =FontLab= In May 2005, FontLab Ltd. announced that they had licensed distribution rights from Macromedia, and resumed development. They are currently selling Fontographer along with their other products. In December 2005 FontLab shipped a new version of Fontographer for Mac OS, running natively on OS X and featuring numerous bug fixes. They have since exercised their option to buy all rights to Fontographer, so it is now fully owned by FontLab Ltd. In June 2010, Fontographer version 5.0 was released by FontLab. This represents the first major features added to the product since 1996. FontLab has positioned the product as an easier-to-use alternative to FontLab Studio, though without as many of the high-end features needed by professional type designers, and given it a price intermediate between FontLab Studio and their more introductory font editing program TypeTool. In the summer of 2011, Fontlab released Fontographer 5.1. The latest version of Fontographer (5.2) is still a 32-bit application, and the Mac version is not expected to run on the upcoming macOS 10.15 (the next full macOS to be released after Mojave, expected in fall 2019).

He wrote The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, a history of Nazi Germany that has been read by many and cited in scholarly works for more than 50 years. Originally a foreign correspondent for the Chicago Tribune and the International News Service, Shirer was the first reporter hired by Edward R. Murrow for what became a CBS radio team of journalists known as \\"Murrow's Boys\\". He became known for his broadcasts from Berlin, from the rise of the Nazi dictatorship through the first year of World War II (1940). With Murrow, he organized the first broadcast world news roundup, a format still followed by news broadcasts. Shirer wrote more than a dozen books besides The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, including Berlin Diary (published in 1941); The Collapse of the Third Republic (1969), which drew on his experience living and working in France from 1925 to 1933; and a three-volume autobiography, 20th Century Journey (1976 to 1990).  Personal life  Born in Chicago in 1904, Shirer attended Washington High School and Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He graduated from Coe in 1925. Working his way to Europe on a cattle boat to spend the summer there, he remained in Europe for 15 years. He was European correspondent for the Chicago Tribune from 1925 to 1932, covering Europe, the Near East and India. In India he formed a friendship with Mohandas Gandhi. Shirer lived and worked in France for several years starting in 1925. He left in the early 1930s but returned frequently to Paris throughout the decade. He lived and worked in Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1940. In 1931, Shirer married Theresa (\\"Tess\\") Stiberitz, an Austrian photographer. The couple had two daughters, Eileen (\\"Inga\\") and Linda. Shirer and his wife divorced in 1970. In 1972 he married Martha Pelton, whom he divorced in 1975. His third (and final) marriage was to Irina Lugovskaya, a long-time teacher of Russian at Simon's Rock College. Shirer and Irina had no children. Shirer was residing in Lenox, Massachusetts at the time of his death.William L. Shirer, Author, Is Dead at 89 - NYTimes.com Retrieved 2017-05-05.  Pre-war years  As a print journalist and later as a radio reporter for CBS, Shirer covered the strengthening one-party rule in Nazi Germany beginning in 1933. Shirer reported on Adolf Hitler's peacetime triumphs like the return of the Saarland to Germany and the remilitarization of the Rhineland. Shirer was hired in 1934 for the Berlin bureau of the Universal Service, one of William Randolph Hearst's two wire services. In Berlin Diary, Shirer described this move, in a self-proclaimed bad pun, as going from \\"bad to Hearst\\". When Universal Service folded in August 1937, Shirer was first taken on as second man by Hearst's other wire service, International News Service, then laid off a few weeks later. On the day when Shirer received two weeks' notice from INS, he received a wire from Edward R. Murrow, European manager of Columbia Broadcasting System, suggesting that the two meet. At their meeting a few days later in Berlin, Murrow said that he couldn't cover all of Europe from London and that he was seeking an experienced correspondent to open a CBS office on the Continent. He offered Shirer a job subject to an audition‚Äîa \\"trial broadcast\\"‚Äîto let CBS directors and vice presidents in New York judge Shirer's voice. Shirer feared that his reedy voice was unsuitable for radio, but he was hired. As European bureau chief, he set up headquarters in Vienna, a more central and more neutral spot than Berlin. His job was to arrange broadcasts, and early in his career he expressed disappointment at having to hire newspaper correspondents to do the broadcasting; at the time, CBS correspondents were prohibited from speaking on the radio. Shirer was the first of \\"Murrow's Boys\\", broadcast journalists who provided news coverage during World War II and afterward. CBS's prohibition of correspondents talking on the radio, viewed by Murrow and Shirer as \\"absurd\\", ended in March 1938. Shirer was in Vienna on March 11, 1938, when the German annexation of Austria (Anschluss) took place after weeks of mounting pressure by Nazi Germany on the Austrian government. As the only American broadcaster in Vienna (NBC rival Max Jordan was not in town), Shirer had a scoop but lacked the facilities to report it to his audience. Occupying German troops controlling the Austrian state radio studio would not let him broadcast. At Murrow's suggestion, Shirer flew to London via Berlin; he recalled in Berlin Diary that the direct flight to London was filled with Jews trying to escape from German-occupied Austria. Once in London, Shirer broadcast the first uncensored eyewitness account of the annexation. Meanwhile, Murrow flew from London to Vienna to cover for Shirer. The next day, CBS's New York headquarters asked Shirer and Murrow to produce a European roundup, a 30-minute broadcast featuring live reporting from five European capitals: Berlin, Vienna, Paris, Rome, and London. The broadcast, arranged in eight hours using the telephone and broadcasting facilities of the day, was a major feat. This first news roundup established a formula still used in broadcast journalism. It was also the genesis of what became CBS World News Roundup, still on the network each morning and evening, network broadcasting's oldest news series. Shirer reported on the Munich Agreement and Hitler's occupation of Czechoslovakia before reporting on the growing tensions between Germany and Poland in 1939 and the German invasion of Poland that launched World War II on September 1, 1939. During much of the pre-war period, Shirer was based in Berlin and attended Hitler's speeches and several party rallies in Nuremberg.  Reporting the war from Berlin  Shirer (center) in Compiegne, France, reporting on the signing of the armistice. When war broke out on the Western Front in 1940, Shirer moved forward with the German troops, reporting firsthand on the German \\"Blitzkrieg\\". Shirer reported on the invasion of Denmark and Norway in April from Berlin and then on the invasion of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, and France in May. As German armies closed in on Paris, he traveled to France with the German forces. Shirer reported the signing of the German armistice with France on June 22, 1940, to the American people before it had been announced by the Germans. His commentary from Compi√®gne was hailed as a masterpiece. On the day before the armistice was to be signed, Hitler ordered all foreign correspondents covering the German Army from Paris to move back to Berlin. It was Hitler's intention that the Armistice should be reported to the world by Nazi sources. Shirer avoided being returned to Berlin by leaving the press hotel early in the morning and hitching a ride to Compi√®gne with a German officer who despised Hitler. Once on site, Shirer was able to give an eye-witness account of that historical moment, \\"I am but fifty yards from [Hitler]. [‚Ä¶] I have seen that face many times at the great moments of his life. But today! It is afire with scorn, anger, hate, revenge, triumph.\\" Then he followed proceedings inside the railway car, listening to the transmission relayed to Berlin through a German army communications truck. After the armistice was signed, Shirer was allowed to transmit his own broadcast to Berlin, but only for recording and release after the Nazi version had been disseminated. Shirer spent five minutes before he went on the air calling CBS radio in New York, hoping that the broadcast would get through. It did. When German engineers in Berlin heard Shirer calling New York, they assumed that he was authorized to broadcast. Instead of sending his report to a recording machine as ordered, they put it on the shortwave transmitter. When CBS heard Shirer's call, he was put on live. For six hours Shirer's report was the only news the world had of the Armistice.William L. Shirer (1984). The Nightmare Years, Boston: Little, Brown. Pages 537‚Äì41. In peacetime, Shirer's reporting was subject only to self-censorship. He and other reporters in Germany knew that if Nazi officials in Joseph Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry objected to their reporting, they could withdraw access to state-owned broadcasting facilities or expel them from Germany. Shirer was granted more freedom than German reporters writing or broadcasting for domestic audiences. At the beginning of the war, German officials established censorship; Shirer recalled that the restrictions were similar to wartime censorship elsewhere, restricting information that could be used to Germany's military disadvantage. However, as the war continued and as Britain began to bomb German cities, including Berlin, Nazi censorship became more onerous to Shirer and his colleagues. In contrast to Murrow's live broadcasts of German bombing of London in the Blitz, foreign correspondents in Germany were not allowed to report British air raids on German cities. They were not permitted to cast doubt on statements by the Propaganda Ministry and Military High Command. Reporters were discouraged by the Propaganda Ministry from reporting news or from using terms like Nazi that might \\"create an unfavorable impression\\". Shirer resorted to subtler ways until the censors caught on. As the summer of 1940 progressed, the Nazi government pressed Shirer to broadcast official accounts that he knew were incomplete or false. As his frustration grew, he wrote to bosses in New York that tightening censorship was undermining his ability to report objectively and mused that he had outlived his usefulness in Berlin. Shirer was subsequently tipped off that the Gestapo was building an espionage case against him, which carried the death penalty. Shirer began making arrangements to leave Germany, which he did in December 1940. Shirer smuggled his diaries and notes out of Germany and used them for his Berlin Diary, a firsthand, day-by-day account of events in Nazi Germany during five years of peace and one year of war. It was published in 1941. Historians comparing the original manuscript diary with the published text discovered that Shirer made many changes. Like many others his early impressions of Hitler had been favourable, and revised later. Much of the text about the pre-1934 to 1938 period was first written long after the war began. He returned to Europe to report on the Nuremberg trials in 1945.  Post-war years  During the war Shirer became a director of the Society for the Prevention of World War III, which lobbied after the war for a harsh peace with Germany. Shirer received a 1946 Peabody Award for Outstanding Reporting and Interpretation of News for his work at CBS. The friendship between Shirer and Murrow ended in 1947, culminating in Shirer's leaving CBS in one of the great confrontations of American broadcast journalism (below). Shirer briefly provided analysis for the Mutual Broadcasting System and then found himself unable to find regular radio work. He was named in Red Channels (1950), which practically barred him from broadcasting and print journalism, and he was forced into lecturing for income. Times remained tough for Shirer, his wife Tess, and daughters Inga and Linda until Simon & Schuster published The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich in 1960. The hardback was reprinted 20 times in the first year and sold more than 600,000 copies through Book of the Month Club alone and 1 million copies overall. Serialization of a condensed version in Readers Digest and critical acclaim ensured its success in the US. Fawcett Crest gained paperback rights for $400,000 ‚Äì a record for the time ‚Äì and a further 1 million copies were sold at $1.65 (). It won the 1961 National Book Award for Nonfiction \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1961\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-02-20. and Carey‚ÄìThomas Award for non-fiction.  Shirer and Murrow  The dispute between Shirer and Murrow started in 1947 when J. B. Williams, a maker of shaving soap, withdrew sponsorship of Shirer's Sunday news show. CBS, through Murrow, who was then vice president for public affairs, and CBS head William S. Paley, did not seek another sponsor, moved Shirer's program to Sunday midday and then stopped producing it, all within a month. CBS maintained that Shirer resigned based on a comment made in an impromptu interview, but Shirer said he was essentially forced out. Stating in his third volume of memoirs: \\"I had no intention of staying on with CBS so that Paley and Murrow could humiliate me further.\\" Shirer contended that the root of his troubles was that the network and sponsor did not stand by him because of his on-air comments, such as those critical of the Truman Doctrine, and what he viewed as an emphasis on placating sponsors rather than an emphasis on journalism. He also said that the sponsor (as well as others) had hinted that he was \\"too liberal\\" at a time when the Cold War was beginning. Shirer blamed Murrow for his departure from CBS, referring to Murrow as \\"Paley's toady\\". He admitted to being \\"puzzled\\" as to why Murrow (and Paley) did not stand by him in this situation. Shirer believed there were possibly several factors: he had turned down a offer from Phil Wrigley (who was the largest single advertiser on CBS at the time) to broadcast in Chicago (which upset Paley), a subtle rivalry between Shirer and Murrow (that Shirer contends he never felt), and the fact Paley and Murrow blamed Shirer for the negative publicity that arose out of Shirer's leaving. CBS received thousands of letters and phone calls protesting the end of Shirer's broadcasts. Tuesday after the broadcast announcing Shirer's final show would be in a week, picketers appeared in front of the entrance to CBS. The episode hastened Murrow's desire to give up his vice-presidency and return to newscasting. It foreshadowed his misgivings about the future of broadcast journalism and his difficulties with Paley. The friendship between Shirer and Murrow never recovered. In her preface to This is Berlin, a compilation of Shirer's Berlin broadcasts published after his death, Shirer's daughter Inga describes how Murrow, suffering from lung cancer which he knew could be terminal, tried to heal the breach with Shirer by inviting the Shirers to his farm in 1964. Murrow tried to discuss the breach. Though the two chatted, Shirer steered the conversation away from contentious issues between the two men, and they never had another opportunity to speak before Murrow died in 1965. Shirer's daughter also writes that, shortly before her father's death in 1993, he rebuffed her attempts to learn the source of the breach that opened between the two journalists 45 years earlier. In The Nightmare Years (1984), the second volume in Shirer's three-volume memoir, 20th Century Journey, Shirer describes the birth and growth of a warm relationship with Murrow in the 1930s. Although his reminiscences are wound together with his version of their professional relationship, he emphasizes that he and Murrow were close friends as well as colleagues. He does not mention their break. A number of touching recollections are included. Thus, it is easy to understand that their break in 1947, based on business disagreements, was made bitter by the close personal relationship they once had. Another aspect of The Nightmare Years is Shirer's description of his and Murrow's three-way relationship with Paley. Shirer says that, in private, he and Murrow were contemptuous of Paley and almost always sided against him in the 1930s. Thus, when Paley and Murrow ganged up on Shirer in 1947, it was a shock, although Shirer does not say so explicitly.

He also performed on stage at the Stratford Festival, worked in radio, and hosted CBC's daily television cooking-talk show Celebrity Cooks in the late 1970s. Early life and education Gerussi was born in Medicine Hat, Alberta, the eldest son of Enrico Gerussi, a coal miner working in Lethbridge, who had trained in Italy as a stonemason, and his wife Teresina. The two married in 1927 and moved to Medicine Hat. The family subsequently moved to Exshaw where Enrico worked as a sectionman on the Canadian Pacific Railway. Bruno Gerussi grew up in Exshaw and later moved with his family to New Westminster, British Columbia. He attended the Banff School of Fine Arts. Early career In 1954 Gerussi joined the Stratford Festival in its second season.https://archives.stratfordfestival.ca/AIS/Details/people/6738 During the next few years he went on to act in many stage productions in Canada and the United States, including performing the role of Romeo in the Stratford Festival's first production of Romeo and Juliet in 1960. Gerussi joined CBC radio, and later appeared on television. One of his earliest TV appearances was as Feste in a 1962 TV production of Twelfth Night. In 1967 and 1968 he hosted a nationally broadcast mid-morning CBC radio show, Gerussi, Words and Music.\\"Popular media personality loved horse racing, alter ego\\". Tom Hawthorn, The Globe and Mail, November 29, 2011 The Beachcombers years Gerussi's best-known role arrived in 1972 when he was signed to play Nick Adonidas in The Beachcombers, a comedy-adventure-drama created by Marc and Susan Strange and set on the west coast of Canada.The Museum of Broadcast Communication The Beachcombers ran for 387 episodes between 1972 and 1990 and remains Canada's longest-ever running weekly dramatic series.\\"Canada 150: Bruno Gerussi was noted Shakespearean actor before becoming a Beachcomber\\". Vancouver Sun, Stephen Hume, March 18, 2017 During part of his time with The Beachcombers, Gerussi hosted the CBC cooking program Celebrity Cooks in the late 1970s and most of the 1980s. The series filmed for 12 seasons, with a Monday-to-Friday time slot for most of those years and Gerussi hosted 478 episodes before the show's last season in production, 1987. The Celebrity Cooks episode featured the last public appearance of actor Bob Crane of Hogan's Heroes fame, who was murdered soon afterwards. The taping of Crane's episode was dramatized in the 2002 film, Auto Focus in which actor John Kapelos portrayed Gerussi. Gerussi's appearances in Celebrity Cooks led him to become commercial spokesperson for a line of microwave ovens in the late-1970s/early-1980s. He appeared in commercials for a variety of food products. He was the host of the first Genie Awards broadcast in 1980. After The Beachcombers On 21 November 1995, Bruno Gerussi died of a heart attack in Vancouver at the home of his companion, Judge Nancy Morrison. The TV movie The New Beachcombers (2002), was dedicated in his memory. A new series was broadcast from 2002 to 2004.

( ; March 8, 1919 ‚Äì May 2, 2000), more popularly known as Bob Homme, was an American-born television actor, best known as the host of The Friendly Giant, a popular Canadian children's television program from the 1950s through the 1980s, which was broadcast on CBC Television. Background Homme was born in Stoughton, Wisconsin into a Norwegian family. His parents were high school woodworking teachers, Raymond and Roselyn Homme. He attended elementary school at West Side School before attending Stoughton High School where graduated in 1937. He enrolled at the University of Wisconsin and graduated with a major in Economics. He worked at a bank before joining the Air National Guard. His unit was activated in June 1941, prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. He was soon promoted to Staff Sergeant, a rank he held for the duration of the war. One of his military assignments was to study psychology at Cornell University. He was later sent to study again at the University of Wisconsin. He finished the war processing and classifying discharging servicemen. Among the notable people he discharged was the actor and director, Captain John Huston. Following graduation, Homme took a job with the University of Wisconsin State Radio Station WHA. Homme was married to Esther Eleanor Anderson and had four children: Richard, Ann, Ruth and Peter. Richard was a Toronto based jazz bassist who died on May 6, 2011. Singer and voice actress Emilie-Claire Barlow is Homme's step-granddaughter. Career =The Friendly Giant= While working at WHA, Homme would regularly drive from Madison to Chicago to watch rehearsals of a pioneering network television variety show called, The Dave Garroway Show. From these trips, Bob had developed an interest in programing. In 1953 as he was driving back from Chicago to Madison, Wisconsin in 1953 he imagined creating a children's program. Bob recognized that giants were usually portrayed as frightening. It was his wife, Esther, who came up with the idea of a \\"friendly giant.\\" Bob recognized that taking what is usually associated as a scary character and making it nice makes it doubly nice. Casper the Friendly Ghost is all the more friendly because that is not how ghosts are imagined. A friendly giant therefore becomes an even more friendly giant when compared to the Jack and the Beanstalk variety giant. Homme approached the program director of the WHA. The University was six months away from having their television license. While continuing to work full time on the radio, he began developing the new children‚Äôs television show. The Friendly Giant began on an educational television station at the University of Wisconsin on May 8, 1954. National Educational Television carried it in the United States from 1955 to 1968. The CBC Television produced it and telecast it from 1958 to 1986. It was later run in syndication on Canada's YTV. The show was outlined but never scripted. Homme's dramatic style was minimalist. He recognized that television was a \\"hot medium\\" so that it was easy to exaggerate any actions or dialogue. Consistent with his personality, he tended to underplay his performances. This was in contrast to other high energy early television programs such as Howdy Doody. Bob and his puppeteer partner (originally Ken Ohst in Wisconsin and then Rod Coneybeare in Canada) used the comfortable repartee of old radio programs Bob had enjoyed like, Vic and Sade, Burns and Allen, Bob and Ray, and the Easy Aces. Television production innovation One of his television production innovations was to change the perspective of the camera. Instead of the normal camera angles, raise the miniatures to camera height and place the human being as the unusual shot above the set. Suddenly, the person became the giant. Using a tight cover-shot and a loose close-up seemed to violate the newly established rules of television but it worked perfectly in creating the sense of a large giant. This countered the Godzilla effect where viewers watched a full size monster walk around a miniature set. He always kept the giant character somewhere in the shot to emotionally reassure his preschool audience and to minimize any jarring effect. =Music= Growing up in a musical family, they enjoyed singing together and performing for the extended family each other on a Saturday night. Young Homme and his father had a little vaudeville act that was available when needed in the community. He later joined the school band at the University of Wisconsin. While Bob is best known for playing the recorder, his first instruments were the clarinet and the saxophone. He first purchased a recorder while stationed in New York City during his military service to give him an inexpensive and portable instrument during his travels. The recorder would become his signature instrument. On each episode of the show, he played three different recorders to match the pitch of each to the desired tone at that stage of the show. =Other= An image of Homme, his wife, Esther, and their dog, Molly, during retirement. Bob Homme was the model in a number of paintings by his friend and Canadian artist, James Lumbers. Lumbers' \\"Moments in Time\\" paintings often featured images from the present together with a faded image of a person and things from the past at the same location. Homme's likeness was used in the images of grandfather types in these paintings such as \\"Lucky Strike\\" and \\"Gone Fishing.\\" The Springer spaniel in \\"Old Friends\\" was the Homme‚Äôs dog, Molly. In one painting of a honky-tonk piano player called \\"Billy Nine Fingers,\\" Bob and Esther are one of the couples sitting at a table in the foreground. Later life and retirement Homme became a citizen of Canada in the early 1990s, holding both American and Canadian citizenships, and was invested into the Order of Canada as a Member on November 2, 1998 in Grafton, Ontario. As Homme was too ill to travel, the Governor General Rom√©o LeBlanc came to him (instead of making Homme come to Rideau Hall where the award is usually bestowed), thus allowing him the postnominal C.M. Bob and Esther Homme retired to a rural property near Grafton, Ontario. In retirement, Bob joined the Cobourg Rotary Club and was active as a member. He and fellow Rotarian, Wally Reid formed a group, \\"Time Share.\\" Together, they regularly performed music in area retirement and nursing homes. Death Homme died on May 2, 2000 of prostate cancer. He was 81 years old. He is buried at the Fairview Cemetery, Grafton, Northumberland, Ontario, Canada. Biography * Grant D. Fairley. (2010).The Friendly Giant: The Biography of Robert Homme.

More widely, the term patriarchs can be used to refer to the twenty male ancestor-figures between Adam and Abraham. The first ten of these are called the antediluvian patriarchs, because they came before the Flood. Lifespans The lifetimes given for the patriarchs in the Masoretic Text of the Book of Genesis are: Adam 930 years, Seth 912, Enos 905, Kenan 910, Mahalalel 895, Jared 962, Enoch 365 (did not die, but was taken away by God), Methuselah 969, Lamech 777, Noah 950.Ages of the patriarchs in Genesis The lifespans given have surprising chronological implications, as the following quotation shows.

He was \\"noted for his Christian piety, his humility and gentleness, and his devotion to his calling\\". Early life Leighton lived through one of the most turbulent periods in Scottish history. His grandfather was a Pre-Reformation Catholic; his father, Doctor Alexander Leighton was tortured during the reign of King Charles I for his Presbyterian beliefs, after authoring a pamphlet Zion's Plea against Prelacy in which he criticised the church, condemning bishops as \\"anti-christian and satanic\\". Robert became an archbishop during one of the periods when the Church of Scotland was episcopal. Robert Leighton was born in London to Scottish parents in 1611.\\"Robert Leighton\\", The Leighton Library Robert Leighton's mother was Alexander Leighton's first wife. According to Gilbert Burnet, Leighton was distinguished for his \\"saintly disposition\\" from his earliest childhood, even despite the persecution of his family. In 1627 (before his father published his pamphlet) at the age of sixteen, Robert Leighton went to study at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with an MA in 1631. Following his graduation, his father sent him to travel abroad, and he is understood to have spent several years in France, where he acquired a complete mastery of the French language. While there he passed a good deal of time with relatives at Douai who had become Roman Catholics, and with whom he kept up a correspondence for many years afterward. Either at this time or on some subsequent visit he had also a good deal of intercourse with members of the Jansenist party. This intercourse contributed to the charity towards those who differed from him in religious opinion, which ever afterward formed a feature in his character. Church career Having returned to Scotland, at the age of thirty, Leighton was ordained as a Minister in the Church of Scotland on 16 December 1641. The ordination took place at Newbattle in Midlothian and thirty-year-old Leighton was installed as Parish Minister of Newbattle on the same date. Following the furore over his father's actions, it took a while before Leighton was accepted as Minister. Parish records show that he had to deliver five trial sermons - two of which had to be delivered on the same day - before being accepted: :On the 16th of December, decreed as a whilk day for the appointment of Mr Robert Lichtoune, a sermon was delivered by John Knox, based on Hebrews 13 Verse 17. After his sermon, Mr John Knox put to Robert Lichtoune and the parishioners, sundry questions competent to ye occasion and after the imposition of hands and ye solemne prayer, was admitted minister of Newbattle (Session Records) Leighton signed the Solemn League and Covenant in 1643. Leighton served at Newbattle for eleven years, before resigning his charge in 1652. What led him to take this step is not immediately clear, though the account given is that he had little sympathy with the fiery zeal of his brother clergymen on certain political questions, and that this led to severe censures on their part. University of Edinburgh Early in 1653, Leighton was appointed principal of the University of Edinburgh, and primarius professor of divinity. The position was originally supposed to be filled by William Colvill, but Colvill was unable to take possession of it, since he was in the Netherlands and so the position was declared vacant again, and Leighton appointed in Colvill's place. Leighton continued in this post until 1662, when he was succeeded by Colvill, who had since returned to Scotland. A considerable number of his Latin prelections and other addresses (published after his death) are remarkable for the purity and elegance of their Latinity, and their subdued and meditative eloquence. They are valuable instructions in the art of living a holy life rather than a body of scientific divinity. Throughout, however, they bear the marks of a deeply learned and accomplished mind, saturated with both classical and patristic reading, and like all his works they breathe the spirit of one who lived very much above the world. While at the university and afterwards he wrote commentaries on New Testament books and his theological and expository lectures were also published, notably An Exposition of the Creed, Lord's prayer and Ten Commandments, Rules and Instructions for a Holy Life and A Modest Defence of Moderate Episcopacy. Bishop and Archbishop Although an ordained Presbyterian minister, in 1661 Leighton allowed himself to be appointed Bishop by King Charles II. Aware that he might be accused of seeking self-aggrandisement, he requested the post in Dunblane, the smallest and poorest see in the country. He sought to reconcile Presbyterians and Episcopalians in a United Church of Scotland, but his mild-mannered nature gave him problems in this role, Bishop Leighton suggested a system of ecclesiastical government in which the bishops were guided by the majority view of their presbyters but this found no favour with the other bishops. He attempted to resign in 1665, making a trip to London for that purpose, but did not go through with this after King Charles II agreed to milder measures.\\"Restoration of King and Episcopacy\\", The Scottish Episcopal Church He repeated his trip to London again in 1669, but little result followed. In 1670, he hesitantly agreed to accept appointment as Archbishop of Glasgow.\\"Robert Leighton\\", University of Glasgow In this higher sphere he redoubled his efforts with the Presbyterians to bring about some degree of conciliation with Episcopacy, but the only result was to embroil himself with the hot-headed Episcopal party as well as with the Presbyterians. He resigned the archbishopric in 1674. Religious views Leighton saw good and bad in both the Episcopal and the English Puritan forms of worship. The Puritan Party gained such popularity that Leighton retired from the Ministry at Newbattle, citing the introduction of the Cromwellian ideas as to doctrine and ritual, as his main reason. Scotland's \\"Apostle of Peace\\", as he became known, took up the post at Edinburgh University as principal for a period of 8 years, before being summoned to London, by Charles II, to be one of four bishops appointed to look after the King's Northern realm in the Westminster Way. Hence his term at Dunblane as bishop and subsequently at Glasgow as archbishop. Later life After leaving his position as archbishop in 1674, Leighton retired to the mansion of his widowed sister Sapphira (Mrs Edward Lightmaker), and her son, at Broadhurst in Sussex. Leighton died suddenly on 25 June 1684 during a trip to London, in an inn in the shadow of a partly finished St Paul's Cathedral. His final parting wish was that \\"At eventide there might be light\\". Leighton was buried in Horsted Keynes, Sussex. In his will, he bequeathed his collection of 1,400 volumes and a hundred pounds for the erection of the Leighton Library. He also gave instruction that all his personal papers and manuscripts be destroyed, though this never took place. Following his death, a commentary of his on 1 Peter, was published in two volumes in 1693 and 1694, and has rarely been out of print ever since. Family Leighton never married, and so had no children. Father: Alexander Leighton Mother: Unknown (Alexander's first wife) :Brother: Elisha Leighton (???‚Äì1684) (later Sir Ellis Leighton) who was secretary to John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton when he was Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1670 and British Ambassador to France in 1675. :Sister: Sapphira (later Mrs Edward Lightmaker) (1623‚Äì1704) :Other Siblings who did not survive to maturity: James, Caleb, Elizabeth. However it is possible that Elizabeth did survive to maturity, as Leighton mentioned his mother and sisters (as opposed to sister) in some correspondence to his brother-in-law, Mr Edward Lightmaker (year unknown): ::My mother writes to me and presses my coming up. I know not yet if that can be. But I intend, God willing, so soon as I can conveniently ... Remember my love to my sisters. The Lord be with you, and lead you in his ways. Leighton Library The Leighton Library, Dunblane Leighton was a learned scholar, with wide-ranging interests. His legacy remains today in the Leighton Library (or Bibliotheca Leightoniana), which is the oldest purpose- built library in Scotland. It contains a collection of around 4000 volumes and 78 manuscripts from the 16th to the 19th century, and is founded on the personal collection of Leighton, who bequeathed some 1500 books to Dunblane Cathedral. A library building was erected between 1684 and 1688 in order to house the books for the use of the local clergy. From 1734 the library became one of the first subscription libraries in Scotland. The collection covers a variety of subject areas, including history and politics (particularly 17th century), theology, medicine, travel, and language.\\"Robert Leighton and His Books\\", University of Sterling Some of the collection was originally owned by Newbattle and was stored at the Old Manse, but it is now held in its entirety at The Cross, Dunblane. The catalogue of contents is now available to academics and researchers through arrangement with Stirling University.

It is not the original, but a replica used in a film. Only two preserved original cars from the other train exist; they are exhibited in the Museum of Slovak National Uprising in Bansk√° Bystrica. An armoured train is a railway train protected with armour. Armoured trains usually include railroad cars armed with artillery, machine guns and autocannons, some also had slits used to fire small arms like pistols and rifles from the inside of the train, this feature was especially prevalent in earlier versions of armoured trains. For the most part they were used during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they offered an innovative way to quickly move large amounts of firepower. Most countries discontinued their use ‚Äì road vehicles became much more powerful and offered more flexibility, and train tracks proved too vulnerable to sabotage as well as to attacks from the air. However, the Russian Federation used improvised armoured trains in the Second Chechen War of 1999‚Äì2009.  Design and equipment  Danuta, in 1939. From the left: artillery wagon, infantry assault wagon, armoured locomotive, artillery wagon A TKS tankette used as an armoured reconnaissance draisine, an attempt to overcome one of the inflexibilities of the armoured train - being limited to the track The rail cars on an armoured train were designed for many tasks. Typical roles included: * Artillery - fielding a mixture of guns, machine guns and rocket launchers. See also railway guns. * Infantry - designed to carry infantry units, may also mount machine guns. * Machine gun - dedicated to machine guns. * Anti-aircraft - equipped with anti-aircraft weapons. * Command - similar to infantry wagons, but designed to be a train command centre * Anti-tank - equipped with anti- tank guns, usually in a tank gun turret * Platform - unarmoured, used for any purpose from the transport of ammunition or vehicles, through track repair or derailing protection to railroad ploughs for track destruction. * Troop sleepers * The German Wehrmacht would sometimes put a Fremdger√§t, such as a captured French Somua S-35 or Czech PzKpfw 38(t) light tank, or Panzer II light tank on a flatbed car which could be quickly offloaded by means of a ramp and used away from the range of the main railway line to chase down enemy partisans * Missile transport - the USSR had railway-based RT-23 Molodets ICBMs by the late 1980s (to reduce the chances of a first strike succeeding in destroying the launchers for a retaliatory strike). The US at one time proposed having a railway-based system for the MX Missile program but this never got past the planning stage Different types of armour were used to protect from attack by tanks. In addition to various metal plates, concrete and sandbags were used in some cases for improvised armoured trains. Armoured trains were sometimes escorted by a kind of rail-tank called a draisine. One such example was the 'Littorina' armoured trolley which had a cab in the front and rear, each with a control set so it could be driven down the tracks in either direction. Littorina mounted two dual 7.92mm MG13 machine gun turrets from Panzer I light tanks.  History  = Origins = Armoured and armed trains saw use during the 19th century in the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì1871), the First and Second Boer Wars (1880‚Äì1881 and 1899‚Äì1902). During the Second Boer War, Winston Churchill, then a war- correspondent, was travelling aboard an armoured train on 15 November 1899, when a Boer commando led by General Louis Botha ambushed the train. The Boers captured Churchill and many of the train's contingent, but many others escaped, including wounded soldiers who had been carried on the train's engine. Early in the 20th century, Russia used armoured trains during the Russo-Japanese War. Armoured trains went on to see use during the Mexican Revolution (1910‚Äì1920) and World War I (1914‚Äì1918). The most intensive use of armoured trains was during the Russian Civil War (1918‚Äì1920). The Spanish Civil War saw a little use of armoured trains, though World War II (1939‚Äì1945) saw more. The French used them during the First Indochina War (1946‚Äì1954), and a number of countries had armoured trains during the Cold War. The last combat use appears to have been during the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. =American Civil War= The most successful armed train was a single armoured wagon built to defend the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad. The railroad had been attacked by southern forces to prevent transport of Union soldiers to the front, and snipers were discouraging men attempting to repair the damage. Baldwin Locomotive Works modified a baggage wagon in late April 1861. A 24-pounder howitzer was placed on a swivel mount at the opposite end of the wagon from the pushing locomotive. The sides of the wagon were sheathed with oak planks covered with boiler plate. The end of the wagon around the howitzer was fitted with hinged panels which could be temporarily lifted to aim and fire the howitzer and then lowered to protect the crew of six men loading the howitzer with canister shot or grapeshot. The remainder of the wagon contained fifty ports for riflemen. The wagon was effective for its original purpose, but vulnerability to artillery rendered such wagons of comparatively little use during later stages of the war. In August 1864, a Confederate raiding party disabled a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad locomotive pushing an armoured wagon, and then piled tires around the armoured wagon and set them afire. =Volunteers= In 1884 Charles Gervaise Boxall (1852‚Äì1914), a Brighton-born solicitor and officer in the 1st Sussex Artillery Volunteers, published The Armoured Train for Coast Defence in Great Britain, outlining a new way to employ heavy artillery. In 1894, when he had become commanding officer of the 1st Sussex AV, railway workers among the volunteers of No 6 Garrison Company manned an armoured train constructed in the workshops of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (of which the unit's Honorary Colonel, Sir Julian Goldsmid, was a director).Norman Litchfield & Ray Westlake, The Volunteer Artillery 1859‚Äì1908 (Their Lineage, Uniforms and Badges), Nottingham: Sherwood Press, 1982, , pp. 160‚Äì2.Boxall at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography =Second Boer War= The British Army employed armoured trains during the Second Boer War, most famously a train that was extemporised in the railway workshops at Ladysmith just before the siege was closed round the town. On 15 November 1899 it left the town on reconnaissance manned by a company of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers under the command of Captain Aylmer Haldane, a company of volunteers of the Durban Light Infantry, and a 7-pounder mountain gun manned by sailors from HMS Tartar. Winston Churchill accompanied the mission as a war correspondent. The train was ambushed and part-derailed, and Haldane, Churchill and some 70 of the troops were captured after a fire-fight, although the locomotive got away with the wounded.Gen Sir Aylmer Haldane, A Soldier's Saga, Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1948, pp. 139‚Äì46.Rayne Kruger, Goodbye Dolly Gray, London: Cassell 1959/Pan 1974, , pp. 104‚Äì5.Thomas Pakenham, The Boer War, London, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1979/abridged edition 1993, , pp. 95‚Äì6. Recalling his experience in My Early Life, Churchill wrote \\"Nothing looks more formidable and impressive than an armoured train; but nothing is in fact more vulnerable and helpless. It was only necessary to blow up a bridge of culvert to leave the monster stranded, far from home and help, at the mercy of the enemy\\".Roy Jenkins, Churchill. A Biography, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York, 2001, p. 52. =World War I= French mobile artillery battery (1914) An Austro-Hungarian armoured train from 1915 Hungarian M√ÅVAG armoured train in 1914 During World War I Russia used a mix of light and heavy armoured trains. The heavy trains mounted 4.2 inch or 6 inch guns; the light trains were equipped with 7.62 mm guns. Austria-Hungary also fielded armoured trains against the Italians in World War I. A Royal Navy armoured train from Britain, armed with four QF 6 inch naval guns and one QF 4 inch naval gun, was used in support of the British Expeditionary Force in the opening phase of the First Battle of Ypres in October 1914.1914: The Days of Hope, Lyn MacDonald, Penguin Books 1989 Crewe-built armoured train for coastal defence in Britain during WW1 Two armoured trains were constructed at Crewe Works during 1915 for British coastal defence duties; one was based in Norfolk and one in Edinburgh to patrol rail routes on stretches of coast considered vulnerable to amphibious assault. The trains comprised two gun trucks, one at each end, mounted with a 12-pounder quick firing gun and a machine gun; an armoured cabin behind the artillery piece contained the magazine. Inboard of each gun truck was a truck for infantry quarters. This was also armoured, with observation ports and loops for rifle fire. The armoured locomotive, with the cab and motion protected, was marshalled into the centre of the train. The driver took up a position at whichever end of the train was leading, with the regulator controlled by a mechanical connection. The intention was that the infantry, with artillery support from the train's guns, was to hold off a hostile landing force until reinforcements could be deployed. =Interwar years= The Bolshevik forces in the Russian Civil War used a wide range of armoured trains. Many were improvised by locals, others were constructed by naval engineers at the Putilov and Izhorskiy factories. As a result, the trains ranged from little more than sandbagged flatbeds to the heavily armed and armoured trains produced by the naval engineers. An attempt to standardise the design from October 1919 only had limited success. By the end of the war the Bolshevik forces had 103 armoured trains of all types. Estonian improvised armoured train in 1919 during the Estonian War of Independence. The Czechoslovak Legion used heavily armed and armoured trains to control large lengths of the Trans-Siberian Railway (and of Russia itself) during the Russian Civil War at the end of World War I.First World War - Willmott, H.P.; Dorling Kindersley, 2003, Page 251 Estonia built a total of 13 armoured trains during the Estonian War of Independence: six on broad-gauge and seven on narrow-gauge railways. The first three armoured trains with fully volunteer crews formed the backbone of the front in critical early stages of conflict. Carriages were former goods carriages and at first armor was limited to wood and sand, but later steel plating, machine guns, and cannons were added. Lithuania had three armoured trains, named after the Grand Dukes of Lithuania: Gediminas, Kƒôstutis and Algirdas. The armoured trains were used from 1920 to 1935. The first of them, Gediminas, was used in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian War. Lithuanian armoured train Gediminas 3 with Lithuanian soldiers After the First World War the use of armoured trains declined. They were used in China in the twenties and early thirties during the Chinese Civil War,\\"Armored Car Like Oil Tanker Used by Chinese\\" Popular Mechanics, March 1930 most notably by the warlord Zhang Zongchang, who employed refugee Russians to man them. =World War II= ≈ömia≈Çy and Pi≈Çsudczyk Original tank car of the ≈†tef√°nik armoured train exhibited in Bansk√° Bystrica Poland used armoured trains extensively during the invasion of Poland. One observer noted that \\"Poland had only few armoured trains, but their officers and soldiers were fighting well. Again and again they were emerging from a cover in thick forests, disturbing German lines\\".Wie das Gesetz es befahl - Karschkes, Helmut, DVG Deutsche Verlagsgesellschaft, One under-appreciated aspect of so many Polish armoured trains being deployed during the Polish Defensive War in 1939 is that when German planes attacked the railroads, it was usually the tracks themselves. As late as September 17, three fresh divisions in the east were moved westward by train. On September 18, three more divisions followed. This in turn prompted Nazi Germany to reintroduce armoured trains into its own armies. Germany then used them to a small degree during World War II.see also Wolfgang Sawodny (2003): Deutsche Panzerz√ºge, They introduced significant designs of a versatile and well-equipped nature, including railcars which housed anti- aircraft gun turrets, or designed to load and unload tanks and railcars which had complete armour protection with a large concealed gun/howitzer. Germany also had fully armoured locomotives which were used on such trains. During the Slovak National Uprising, the Slovak resistance used three armoured trains. They were named Hurban, ≈†tef√°nik and Masaryk. They were built in the Zvolen railway factory in very short time - ≈†tef√°nik was built just in 14 days, Hurban in 11 days. Boiler plates were used as the armor. In case of tank cars, whole tanks were used ‚Äì tanks LT-35 were placed at the platform wagon and armored construction was built around the hull. Trains saw combat near Star√° Kremniƒçka, ƒåremo≈°n√©, around Brezno. Later they were abandoned near Harmanec. Some of train cars were later used by Germans for training and for patrolling. Two original cars from the ≈†tef√°nik train are preserved ‚Äì tank car (with original LT-35 tank inside) and machine gun car, and they are exhibited in the Museum of Slovak National Uprising in Bansk√° Bystrica. Another train is exhibited in Zvolen ‚Äì it's a replica of armoured train Hurban, which was built for the movie De≈à, ktor√Ω neumrie. Difference of this replica in comparison with original trains are bigger turrets from tank T-34/85, instead of turrets from LT-35. A Russian WW II-era armoured train with antiaircraft gunners The Red Army had a large number of armoured trains at the start of World War II but many were lost in 1941. Trains built later in the war tended to be fitted with T-34 or KV series tank turrets. Others were fitted as specialist anti- aircraft batteries. A few were fitted as heavy artillery batteries often using guns taken from ships. Canada used an armoured train to patrol the Canadian National Railway along the Skeena River from Prince Rupert, British Columbia to the Pacific coast, against a possible Japanese seaborne raid. The train was equipped with a 75 mm gun, two Bofors 40 mm guns, and could accommodate a full infantry company. The No 1 Armoured Train entered service in June 1942 and was put into reserve in September 1943, to be dismantled in the following year.Rowse, Sue Harper (2005), In Times of War: Prince Rupert 1939-1945 (pp. 82-84) Twelve armoured trains were formed in Britain in 1940 as part of the preparations to face a German invasion; these were initially armed with QF 6 pounder 6 cwt Hotchkiss guns and six Bren Guns. They were operated by Royal Engineer crews and manned by Royal Armoured Corps troops. In late 1940 preparations began to hand the trains over to the Polish Army in the West, who operated them until 1942.Balfour, G 1981. The Armoured Train: its development and usage.

A 6-pounder wagon from one of these trains is preserved at the Tank Museum. A miniature armoured train ran on the 15-inch gauge Romney Hythe and Dymchurch Railway. The Imperial Japanese Army also utilized armored trains. First in the 1920s, to guard the rail lines in Manchuria and later when they engaged Chinese NRA and CPC troops in Second Sino-Japanese War.Taki's Imperial Japanese Army page: Improvised Armored TrainTaki's Imperial Japanese Army page: Special Armored TrainTaki's Imperial Japanese Army page: Type 94 Armored Train Preserved command car of German World War II era armoured train BP-42 from the railway museum in Bratislava =Later uses= A RT-23 Molodets in the Saint Petersburg railway museum In the First Indochina War, the French Union used the armoured and armed train La Rafale as both a cargo-carrier and a mobile surveillance unit.Le 5e R√©giment du G√©nie d'hier et d'aujourd'hui : l'aventure des Sapeurs de chemins de fer, Lavauzelle, 1997, p. 73 L‚Äôaudace du rail : les trains blind√©s du Sud-Annam in Revue historique des arm√©es #234, Alexis Neviaski, 2004, quoted in the French Defense Ministry archives In February 1951 the first Rafale was in service on the Saigon-Nha Trang line, VietnamFrench Defense Ministry archives ECPAD website French Defense Ministry archives ECPAD website while from 1947 to May 1952 the second one which was escorted by onboard Cambodian troops of the BSPP (Brigade de Surveillance de Phnom Penh) was used on the Phnom Penh-Battambang line, Cambodia.French Defense Ministry archives ECPAD website In 1953 both trains were attacked by the Viet-Minh guerrillas who destroyed or mined stone bridges when passing by.French Defense Ministry archives ECPAD website Fulgencio Batista‚Äôs army operated an armoured train during the Cuban revolution though it was derailed and destroyed during the Battle of Santa Clara. Facing the threat of Chinese cross-border raids during the Sino-Soviet split, the USSR developed armoured trains in the early 1970s to protect the Trans-Siberian Railway. According to different accounts, four or five trains were built. Every train included ten main battle tanks, two light amphibious tanks, several AA guns, as well as several armoured personnel carriers, supply vehicles and equipment for railway repairs. They were all mounted on open platforms or in special rail cars. Different parts of the train were protected with 5‚Äì20 mm thick armour. These trains were used by the Soviet Army to intimidate nationalist paramilitary units in 1990 during the early stages of the Nagorno-Karabakh War.Sovetskaja Armija v gody \\"cholodnoj vojny\\" : (1945‚Äì1991) - Fes¬∑kov, Vitalij I; Kala≈°nikov, Konstantin A; Golikov, Valerij I; Tomsk Izdat.

The train was eventually destroyed by its own crew lest it fall into enemy hands during Operation Storm, Croatia's successful effort to reclaim the territories under occupation by Serbs. The Army of Republika Srpska operated a similar train that was ambushed and destroyed in October 1992 at the entrance to the town of Gradaƒçac by Bosnian Muslim forces that included a T-55 tank. The wreckage was later converted into a museum. The Croatian Army deployed a two-wagon armoured train built in Split with a shield composed of two plates, one 8 mm and the other 6 mm thick, with a 30‚Äì50 mm gap filled with sand between them. The vehicle was armed with 12.7 mm machine guns.Hrvatski oklopni voz One armoured train that remains in regular use is that of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, which the former received as a gift from the Soviet Union and the latter used heavily for state visits to China and Russia as he had a fear of flying.

It is long ( including its source river Schwarza). Etymology The Lithaha River in the Carolingian Avar March was first mentioned in an 833 deed issued by Louis the German, son of the Carolingian emperor Louis the Pious and ruler over the stem duchy of Bavaria. The Old High German name l√Æt probably referred to a Pannonian (Illyrian) denotation for \\"mud\\", as maintained in the former Hungarian name S√°r (cf. mocs√°r: swamp). Course Plaque at Leitha origin The Leitha rises in Lower Austria at the confluence of its two headstreams, the Schwarza, discharging the Schneeberg, Rax and Schneealpe ranges of the Northern Limestone Alps, and the Pitten. Between Ebenfurth and Leithaprodersdorf, and between Bruck an der Leitha and Gattendorf,Verified on a modern Atlas the Leitha forms part of the border between the Austrian states of Lower Austria and Burgenland. East of Nickelsdorf, the river passes into Hungary, where it flows into the Moson arm of the Danube west of Szigetk√∂z Island near Mosonmagyar√≥v√°r. Important towns on its course are Wiener Neustadt, Bruck and Mosonmagyar√≥v√°r. Large amounts of the Schwarza headstream waters are diverted to supply the Wiener Neustadt Canal and the drinking water supply of Vienna. Furthermore, several canals diverge from the Leitha, feeding spinning companies in the past, today small hydroelectric power plants. Between Seibersdorf and Hof am Leithaberge, most of the water in the Leitha is removed for this purpose. From there on, the Leitha usually runs dry, unless its flow further upstream is abnormally high. Downriver from Katzelsdorf the river bed is almost completely dry as well. Dried-up streambed of Leitha near Bad Erlach Historic border After the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin in the late 9th century, the Magyar horsemen dared further invasions into the adjacent West Frankish lands, until they were finally defeated by King Otto I in the 955 Battle of Lechfeld. Thereafter the forces of the Bavarian duke Henry the Wrangler gradually re-conquered the lands beyond the Vienna Woods up to the Leitha River, where about 976 the March of Austria (Ostarr√Æchi) was established under the Babenberg margrave Leopold I. Around the turn to the 2nd millennium, the Hungarian frontier (Gyep≈±) ran along the Leitha shore, from 1156 onwards it formed the eastern border of the Duchy of Austria with fortresses erected at Wiener Neustadt, Bruck and Hainburg. The last Babenberg duke Frederick II of Austria was killed in the 1246 Battle of the Leitha River against King B√©la IV of Hungary. The course of the border was confirmed in a 1411 deed issued by King Sigismund, when his daughter Elizabeth married the Habsburg duke Albert II of Austria. Leitha bridge between Wampersdorf (Pottendorf municipality) in Lower Austria and Wimpassing (Vimp√°c) in Burgenland The placenames Cisleithania, Transleithania and Lajtab√°ns√°g are all derived from the Leitha River. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, which created the Dual Monarchy, Transleithanien (\\"beyond the Leitha\\") was the Viennese colloquial word for the region beyond the Leitha (meaning Hungary or the Kingdom of Hungary), while Cisleithanien (\\"on this side of the Leitha\\") denoted the Austrian lands. These names reflected the Viennese and Austrian perspectives towards the rest of the Empire, because Vienna lay on 'this' side, and the other half, Hungary, lay on 'that' side.German wikipedia Nevertheless, the Leitha did not form the entire border between the two: for instance Galicia and Bukovina, which were part of Cisleithania, were north- east of Hungary. Likewise, the Morava River formed the border between Cisleithanian Moravia and the Transleithanian lands of present-day Slovakia (Upper Hungary). Upon the dissolution of Austria-Hungary after World War I, the 1920 Treaty of Trianon adjudicated the West Hungarian territory of the proclaimed Lajtab√°ns√°g (Leitha Banat) to the Republic of Austria (as Burgenland), whereby the course of the river became an inner Austrian border.

Despite their nationality and time period, the band is not generally considered krautrock because of their sound, which has much more in common with English progressive rock and symphonic rock groups such as Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Yes, and Camel. History Founded in 1969 by guitarist Frank Bornemann, the band has endured several line-up changes, with Bornemann being the only consistent member of the group. In the 1980s, after a series of major splits in the group, Bornemann pursued a more commercial direction. Despite attracting a large following in Germany, the band never gained popularity in the United States. However, in later years, former members of the band re- joined, and in 1998 released the album Ocean 2, a return to the classic symphonic progressive rock genre for which the band was well known. The name Eloy is based on the futurist race of humans from the book The Time Machine by H. G. Wells (there spelled \\"Eloi\\"). Bornemann described the origin of the name of the band thus: \\"Wells describes in his book the situation of mankind about 800,000 years later, and 'Eloy' is a human race in his story. The Eloy in Wells' story have made a new start with the help of the time traveler. In a way, it was a new beginning for the human race. German rock bands in the late 1960s played mainly covers from other bands instead of playing their own compositions. Record deals for German bands were absolutely rare and German bands generally were considered to be second class bands in their own country. At that time it was a strong effort for a German band to come out with only their own compositions. It was a start into an unknown future, and from this point of view, comparable to the human race in Wells' story. That is why I got the idea to name the band 'Eloy'.\\" Bornemann reunited Eloy for its 40th anniversary in 2009. After a break of eleven years, the band released a new album called Visionary, aiming to recapture the spirit of the early years. A double DVD The Legacy Box was released in December 2010 and contains a number of videos and television recordings from all periods of the band, as well as a documentary of the band's history. The band played at festivals in Germany and Switzerland in July 2011 with largely the same personnel as those on the 1994‚Äì1995 tour. The band was booked to headline the North East Art Rock Festival in June 2012 ‚Äì its first North American concert ‚Äì but had to cancel after Bornemann was injured in road accident in March. In 2017 and 2019 two new CDs based on the legend of Jeanne d'Arc were released.

It includes any suspended solids (e.g. sediment), dissolved chemicals (e.g. CaCO3(aq)), or biologic material (e.g. diatoms) in addition to the water itself. Synonyms vary by discipline. For example, a fluvial hydrologist studying natural river systems may define discharge as streamflow, whereas an engineer operating a reservoir system might define discharge as outflow, which is contrasted with inflow. Theory and calculation A discharge is a measure of the quantity of any fluid flow over unit time. The quantity may be either volume or mass. Thus the water discharge of a tap (faucet) can be measured with a measuring jug and a stopwatch. Here the discharge might be 1 litre per 15 seconds, equivalent to 67 ml/second or 4 litres/minute. This is an average measure. For measuring the discharge of a river we need a different method and the most common is the 'area/velocity' method. The area is the cross sectional area across a river and the average velocity across that section needs to be measured for a unit time, commonly a minute. Measurement of cross sectional area and average velocity, although simple in concept, are frequently non- trivial to determine. The units that are typically used to express discharge in streams or rivers include m¬≥/s (cubic meters per second), ft¬≥/s (cubic feet per second or cfs) and/or acre-feet per day.Dunne, T., and Leopold, L.B., 1978, Water in Environmental Planning: San Francisco, Calif., W.H. Freeman, pp. 257‚Äì258. A commonly applied methodology for measuring, and estimating, the discharge of a river is based on a simplified form of the continuity equation. The equation implies that for any incompressible fluid, such as liquid water, the discharge (Q) is equal to the product of the stream's cross-sectional area (A) and its mean velocity (\\\\bar{u}), and is written as: :Q=A\\\\,\\\\bar{u} where *Q is the discharge ([L3T‚àí1]; m3/s or ft3/s) *A is the cross-sectional area of the portion of the channel occupied by the flow ([L2]; m2 or ft2) *\\\\bar{u} is the average flow velocity ([LT‚àí1]; m/s or ft/s) For example, the average discharge of the Rhine river in Europe is or per day. Because of the difficulties of measurement, a stream gauge is often used at a fixed location on the stream or river. Catchment discharge The catchment of a river above a certain location is determined by the surface area of all land which drains toward the river from above that point. The river's discharge at that location depends on the rainfall on the catchment or drainage area and the inflow or outflow of groundwater to or from the area, stream modifications such as dams and irrigation diversions, as well as evaporation and evapotranspiration from the area's land and plant surfaces. In storm hydrology, an important consideration is the stream's discharge hydrograph, a record of how the discharge varies over time after a precipitation event. The stream rises to a peak flow after each precipitation event, then falls in a slow recession. Because the peak flow also corresponds to the maximum water level reached during the event, it is of interest in flood studies. Analysis of the relationship between precipitation intensity and duration and the response of the stream discharge are aided by the concept of the unit hydrograph, which represents the response of stream discharge over time to the application of a hypothetical \\"unit\\" amount and duration of rainfall (e.g., half an inch over one hour). The amount of precipitation correlates to the volume of water (depending on the area of the catchment) that subsequently flows out of the river. Using the unit hydrograph method, actual historical rainfalls can be modeled mathematically to confirm characteristics of historical floods, and hypothetical \\"design storms\\" can be created for comparison to observed stream responses. The relationship between the discharge in the stream at a given cross-section and the level of the stream is described by a rating curve. Average velocities and the cross-sectional area of the stream are measured for a given stream level. The velocity and the area give the discharge for that level. After measurements are made for several different levels, a rating table or rating curve may be developed. Once rated, the discharge in the stream may be determined by measuring the level, and determining the corresponding discharge from the rating curve. If a continuous level-recording device is located at a rated cross-section, the stream's discharge may be continuously determined. Larger flows (higher discharges) can transport more sediment and larger particles downstream than smaller flows due to their greater force. Larger flows can also erode stream banks and damage public infrastructure. Catchement effects on river discharge and morphology GH Dury and MJ Bradshaw are two geographers who devised models showing the relationship between discharge and other variables in a river. The Bradshaw model described how pebble size and other variables change from source to mouth; while Dury considered the relationships between discharge and variables such as stream slope and friction. These follow from the ideas presented by Leopold, Wolman and Miller in 'Fluvial Processes in Geomorphology' Leopold, L.B., Wolman, M.G. and Miller, J.P. Fluvial Processes in geomorphology, W.H.

His name is often misspelled by the media, either as Edson instead of Eddison or Zvogbo instead of Zvobgo. He was born in then Southern Rhodesia in 1935, near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo), where his father was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. He comes from the Karanga subgroup of the Shona people. In 1960, Zvobgo won a scholarship to Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts aged 25. After taking a bachelor's degree there in 1964, he returned home to be arrested and detained for political activism against white rule in Rhodesia, along with Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo. Zvobgo was freed in 1971, and he spent a period in exile in Canada. He then studied law at Harvard University and international relations at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, followed by a position as associate professor teaching criminal law at Lewis University College of Law in Illinois. Zvobgo played a key role in international negotiations at Lancaster House that ended the bitter bush war and led to British-sponsored all race elections ahead of independence in 1980. He was the Zanu-PF spokesman, and impressed many in the international press with his quick repartee and astute analysis of the negotiations. In the 1980 elections, he won a seat in parliament for Masvingo, which he continued to hold until his death. An influential member of Zimbabwe's first fully independent cabinet, Zvobgo was minister for local government and housing until 1982, and minister for justice until 1985. As minister of parliamentary and constitutional affairs, in 1987 he made several amendments to the Constitution that concentrated power in the hands of the president and moved Zimbabwe towards a one-party state. Initially a staunch supporter of Zanu-PF policies, in later years he criticised Robert Mugabe's autocratic rule. In 1992 Zvobgo was moved to the less influential post of Minister of Mines. In 1996 he survived a car accident, in which both his legs were broken. This accident was considered suspicious by many. Shortly after the accident Mugabe demoted Zvobgo further to Minister Without Portfolio, and, in 2000, he was dropped from the cabinet altogether. In the 2002 presidential elections, he refused to campaign for Mugabe, but did not endorse the opposition challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). He also voiced his opposition to the sweeping media law, passed the same year, calling it \\"the most serious assault on our constitutional liberties since independence\\".Controversial Zimbabwean politician sidelined for his ambitions to succeed Robert Mugabe The Guardian 24 August 2004 Despite his criticism, Zvobgo eventually voted for the legislation, which was used to close off Zimbabwe's only privately owned daily newspaper, The Daily News, and to arrest at least 31 independent journalists. He became the subject of an internal party disciplinary inquiry in 2003 for his refusal to campaign for Mugabe and after describing the laws as a weapon to stifle opposition to the government, but allegations of disloyalty were eventually dropped. Zvobgo had also been accused of holding private talks with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change as the ruling party abandoned formal dialogue between the two parties. Zvobgo died on 22 August 2004 after a lengthy battle with cancer. His wife Julia Tukai Zvobgo, a former Zanu-PF MP, died in February 2004 at the age of 67. He is survived by his seven children, Kerina, Eddison Jr., Tsungirirai, Jonasi, Esther, Tendai and Farai Emily.

The sole member of the genus Boselaphus, the species was described and given its binomial name by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766. The nilgai stands at the shoulder; males weigh , and the lighter females . A sturdy thin-legged antelope, the nilgai is characterised by a sloping back, a deep neck with a white patch on the throat, a short crest of hair along the neck terminating in a tuft, and white facial spots. A column of pendant coarse hair hangs from the dewlap ridge below the white patch. Sexual dimorphism is prominent ‚Äì while females and juveniles are orange to tawny, adult males have a bluish-grey coat. Only males possess horns, long. The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly during the day). The animals band together in three distinct kinds of groups: one or two females with young calves, three to six adult and yearling females with calves, and all-male groups with two to 18 members. Typically tame, the nilgai may appear timid and cautious if harassed or alarmed; it flees up to -or even , galloping away from the source of danger. Herbivores, nilgai prefer grasses and herbs, though they commonly eat woody plants in the dry tropical forests of India. Females become sexually mature by two years, while males do not become sexually active until four or five years old. The time of the year when mating takes place varies geographically, but a peak breeding season lasting three to four months can be observed at most places. Gestation lasts eight to nine months, following which a single calf (sometimes twins or even triplets) is born. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves stay hidden for the first few weeks of their lives. The lifespan of the nilgai is around ten years. Nilgai prefer areas with short bushes and scattered trees in scrub forests and grassy plains. They are common in agricultural lands, but hardly occur in dense forest. Major populations occur in the Terai lowlands in the foothills of the Himalayas (northern India), but the antelope is sparsely found in Nepal and Pakistan. It was first thought to be extinct in Bangladesh but it was found there on 22 January 2019.The daily star,23 January 2019, page 2 Nilgai were first introduced to Texas in the 1920s and the 1930s. As of 2008, the feral population in Texas is nearly 37,000. The nilgai is categorised as Least Concern by the IUCN. The nilgai has been associated with Indian culture since the Vedic period (1500‚Äì500 BC). Hindus revere the nilgai as sacred and associate it with the cow, the mother animal in Hinduism, through its name and loosely similar physical features. They were hunted in the Mughal era (16th to 19th centuries) and are depicted in numerous miniatures. Nilgai have been considered a pest in several north Indian states, as they ravage crop fields and cause considerable damage. In Bihar, authorities have classified the nilgai as vermin. Etymology The vernacular name \\"nilgai\\" comes from the fusion of the Hindi words nil (\\"blue\\") and gai (\\"cow\\"). The word was first recorded in use in 1882. Alternative origins could be from the Persian gaw (\\"cow\\"). The nilgai has been referred to by a variety of names: neelghae, nilgau, nilgo, nylghau, and nylghai, constructions referring to other \\"blue\\" animals. They are also known as white-footed antelope. During Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's reign (1658‚Äì1707) of India, the nilgai was known by the name nilghor (\\"nil\\" for \\"blue\\" and \\"ghor\\" for \\"horse\\"). Taxonomy The scientific name of the nilgai is Boselaphus tragocamelus. The nilgai is the sole member of the genus Boselaphus and placed in the family Bovidae. The species was described and given its binomial name by the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766. He based his description on a 1745 account of a male nilgai by British physician James Parsons in the 43rd volume of Philosophical Transactions (now known as the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society). The nilgai has one other relative in the tribe Boselaphini, the four-horned antelope (the sole member of Tetracerus). The generic name Boselaphus comes from the combination of the Latin bos (\\"cow\\" or \\"ox\\") and the Greek elaphos (\\"deer\\"). The specific name tragocamelus comes from the join of the two Greek words tragos (\\"he-goat\\") and kamelos (\\"camel\\"). The binomial combination was first used by English zoologist Philip Sclater in 1883. Boselaphus has often been misspelled as Buselaphus (first used by Ludwig Reichenbach in 1845 for the red hartebeest) and Bosephalus (first used by Thomas Horsfield in 1851, when he mistook a nilgai specimen for a hartebeest in a museum catalogue of the East India Company). Evolution A 1992 phylogenetic study of mitochondrial DNA sequences showed a strong possibility of a clade consisting of Boselaphini, Bovini and Tragelaphini. Bovini consists of the genera Bubalus, Bos, Pseudoryx (saola), Syncerus (African Buffalo), Bison and the extinct Pelorovis. Tragelaphini consists of two genera: Taurotragus (eland) and Tragelaphus. A closer relationship between Boselaphini and Tragelaphini was predicted, and seconded by a similar study in 1999. Though the tribe Boselaphini has no African representation today, fossil evidence supports its presence in the continent in the prehistoric times, as early as the late Miocene. The two living antelope species of this tribe have been found to have a closer relationship with the earliest bovids (like Eotragus species) than do the other bovids. This tribe originated at least 8.9 million years ago, in much the same area where the four-horned antelope lives today, and may represent the most \\"primitive\\" of all living bovids, having changed the least since the origins of the family. The extant and extinct boselaphine forms show similar development of the horn cores (the central bony part of the horn). Though the extant nilgai females lack horns, historic relatives of the antelope had horned females. Fossil relatives were once placed in the subfamily Cephalophinae which now contains only the African duikers. Fossils of Protragoceros and Sivoreas dating back to the late Miocene have been discovered not only in Asia and southern Europe but also in the Ngorora formation (Kenya) and are thought to belong to the Boselaphini. Other Miocene fossils of boselaphines discovered are of Miotragocerus, Tragocerus and Tragoportax; fossils of Miotragoceros are not apparent in Africa (only M. cyrenaicus has been reported from the continent), but have significant presence in the Shiwalik Hills in India and Pakistan, as do several Tragoportax species. A 2005 study showed the migration of Miotragoceros to eastern Asia around eight million years ago. Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum reported the presence of another boselaphine, Mesembriportax, from Langebaanweg (South Africa). Remains of the nilgai dating back to the Pleistocene have been discovered from the Kurnool caves in southern India. Evidence suggests that they were hunted by humans during the Mesolithic period (5,000 to 8,000 years ago). Description Close view of a male nilgai showing the facial markings, throat patch, beard and short horns. Skull of a nilgai The nilgai is the largest antelope in Asia. It stands at the shoulder; the head-and-body length is typically between . Males weigh ; the maximum weight recorded is . Females are lighter, weighing . Sexual dimorphism is prominent; the males are larger than females and differ in colouration. A sturdy thin-legged antelope, the nilgai is characterised by a sloping back, a deep neck with a white patch on the throat, a short mane of hair behind and along the back ending behind the shoulder, and around two white spots each on its face, ears, cheeks, lips and chin. The ears, tipped with black, are long. A column of coarse hair, known as the \\"pendant\\" and around long in males, can be observed along the dewlap ridge below the white throat patch. The tufted tail, up to , has a few white spots and is tipped with black. The forelegs are generally longer, and the legs are often marked with white \\"socks\\". While females and juveniles are orange to tawny, males are much darker ‚Äì their coat is typically bluish grey. The ventral parts, the insides of the thighs and the tail are all white. A white stripe extends from the underbelly and broadens as it approaches the rump, forming a patch lined with dark hair. Almost white, though not albino, individuals have been observed in the Sariska National Park (Rajasthan, India) while individuals with white patches have been recorded at zoos. The hairs, typically long, are fragile and brittle. Males have thicker skin on their head and neck that protect them in fights. The coat is not well- insulated with fat during winter, and consequently severe cold might be fatal for the nilgai.Only males possess horns, though a few females may be horned as well. The horns are long but generally shorter than . Smooth and straight, these may point backward or forward. The horns of the nilgai and the four- horned antelope lack the ringed structure typical of those of other bovids. The maximum recorded length of the skull is . The dental formula is . The milk teeth are totally lost and the permanent dentition completed by three years of age. The permanent teeth get degraded with age, showing prominent signs of wear at six years of age. The nilgai has sharp ears and eyes, though its sense of smell is not as acute. Ecology and behavior A group of nilgai resting The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly during the day). A 1991 study investigated the daily routine of the antelope and found feeding peaks at dawn, in the morning, in the afternoon and during the evening. Females and juveniles do not interact appreciably with males, except during the mating season. Groups are generally small, with ten or fewer individuals, though groups of 20 to 70 individuals can occur at times. In a 1980 study in the Bardiya National Park (Nepal), the average herd size was of three individuals; In a 1995 study in the Gir National Park (Gujarat, India), herd membership varied with season. However, three distinct groupings are formed: one or two females with young calves, three to six adult and yearling females with calves, and male groups with two to 18 members. A nilgai running Typically tame, the nilgai may appear timid and cautious if harassed or alarmed; instead of seeking cover like duikers it would flee up to -or even on galloping-away from the danger. Though generally quiet, nilgai have been reported to make short guttural grunts when alarmed, and females to make clicking noises when nursing young. Alarmed individuals, mainly juveniles below five months, give out a coughing roar (whose pitch is highest in case of the juveniles) that lasts half a second, but can be heard by herds less than away and responded to similarly. Fights take place in both sexes and involve pushing their necks against each other or ramming into one another using horns. Fights can be gory; despite the protective skin deep, lacerated wounds and even deaths might occur. Display behaviour focuses on the throat patch and the beard, and threatening opponents by pointing the horns toward them. A young male was observed making a submissive display in the Sariska Reserve by kneeling before an adult male, who stood erect. The nilgai mark their territories by forming dung piles as much as in radius. The defecation process is elaborate-the antelope stands with his legs about a metre apart, with the rump lowered and the tail held almost vertical; it stays in the same posture for at least ten seconds after relieving itself. The process is not as elaborate in the females as it is in the males.Sparring malesIn India, the nilgai shares its habitat with the four-horned antelope, chinkara, chital and blackbuck; its association with the gaur and the water buffalo is less common. In the Ranthambore National Park (Rajasthan, India) the nilgai and the chinkara collectively prefer the area rich in Acacia and Butea species, while the sambar deer and the chital preferred the forests of Anogeissus and Grewia species. In India, the Indian tiger and the lion may prey on the nilgai but they are not significant predators of this antelope. Leopards prey on the nilgai, though they prefer smaller prey. Dholes generally attack juveniles. Other predators include wolves and striped hyenas. =Diet= Nilgai can reach for high branches. Herbivores, the nilgai prefer grasses and herbs; woody plants are commonly eaten in the dry tropical forests of India. Studies suggest they may be browsers or mixed feeders in India, whereas they are primarily grazers in Texas. The nilgai can tolerate interference by livestock and degradation of vegetation in its habitat better than deer, possibly because they can reach high branches and do not depend on surface vegetation. The sambar deer and nilgai in Nepal have similar dietary preferences. Diets generally suffice in protein and fats. The protein content of the nilgai's should be at least seven percent. The nilgai can survive for long periods without water and do not drink regularly even in summer. However, a nilgai died in Dwarka (India) allegedly due to the heat wave and acute shortage of water. A 1994 study of the nilgai's diet in the Sariska Reserve revealed its preference for herbs and grasses; grasses became more important in the rainy season, while during winter and summer it fed additionally on flowers (Butea monosperma), foliage (Anogeissus pendula, Capparis sepiaria, Grewia flavescens and Zizyphus mauritiana), pods (Acacia nilotica, A. catechu and A. leucophloea) and fruits (Zizyphus mauritiana). Preferred grass species include Cenchrus species, Cynodon dactylon, Desmostachya bipinnata, Scirpus tuberosus and Vetiveria zizanoides. Woody plants eaten include Acacia nilotica, A. senegal, A. leucophloea, Clerodendrum phlomidis, Crotalaria burhia, Indigofera oblongifolia, Morus alba and Zizyphus nummularia; herbs favoured are Cocculus hirsutus, Euphorbia hirta and Sida rhombifolia. Seeds of Paspalum distichum occurred in the dung of nilgai most of the year; Acacia nilotica and Prosopis juliflora seeds were discovered in the dry season and those of Echinochloa crusgalli during the monsoon. =Reproduction= Nilgai mating Observations of females in southern Texas revealed that ovaries are developed by two years of age and the first birth takes place typically a year later, though in a few cases females as young as one-and-a-half years may mate successfully. Females can breed again around a year after parturition. Males in the same location were found to have active testes by the age of three years, that matured considerably by the next year. Males become sexually active at four or five years. Mating may occur throughout the year, with peaks of three to four months. The time of the year when these peaks occur varies geographically. In Texas, a peak is apparent from December to March. In Bharatpur National Park (Rajasthan, India) the breeding season is from October to February, peaking in November and December. The Sariska reserve witnesses a similar peak in December and January. A mother with her calves In the mating season, rutting males move about in search of females in oestrus. Males become aggressive and fight among themselves for dominance. These fights are characterised by displays of the enlarged chest, the throat patch and the beard while holding the head upright; and threatening the opponent by running with the horns pointed toward him and circling him. The victorious bull would protect the vicinity of the targeted female from other males. The courtship typically lasts for 45 minutes. The male, stiff and composed, approaches the receptive female, who keeps her head low to the ground and may slowly walk forward. The male licks her genitalia, upon which the female holds her tail to a side and the male gives out a flehmen response. Finally, the male pushes his chest against her rump, and mounts her. Gestation lasts eight to nine months, following which a single calf or twins (even triplets at times) are born. In a 2004 study in the Sariska reserve, twins accounted for as high as 80 percent of the total calf population. Births peak from June to October in the Bharatpur National Park, and from April to August in southern Texas. Calves are precocial; they are able to stand within 40 minutes of birth, and forage by the fourth week. Pregnant females isolate themselves before giving birth. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves are kept in hiding for the first few weeks of their lives. This period of concealment can last as long as a month in Texas. Calves, mainly males, bicker playfully by neck-fighting. Young males would leave their mothers at ten months to join bachelor groups. The lifespan of the nilgai is typically ten years in Texas. Habitat and distribution in the Grassland Nilgai prefer areas with low bushes. Nilgai prefer areas with short bushes and scattered trees in scrub forests and grassy plains. They are common in agricultural lands, but hardly occur in dense woods. In southern Texas, it roams in the prairies, scrub forests and oak forests. It is a generalist animal‚Äîit can adapt to a variety of habitats. Though sedentary and less dependent on water, nilgai may desert their territories if all water sources in and around it dry up. Territories in Texas are large. This antelope is endemic to the Indian subcontinent: major populations occur in India, Nepal and Pakistan, whereas it is extinct in Bangladesh. Significant numbers occur in the Terai lowlands in the foothills of the Himalayas; the antelope is abundant across northern India. The Indian population was estimated at one million in 2001. The nilgai were first introduced to Texas in the 1920s and the 1930s in a large ranch near the Norias Division of the King Ranch, one of the largest ranches in the world. The feral population saw a spurt toward the latter part of the 1940s, and gradually spread out to adjoining ranches. Nilgai search for new areas if they run out of water. Population densities show great geographical variation across India. Density can be as low as 0.23 to 0.34 individuals per km2 in the Indravati National Park (Chhattisgarh) and 0.4 individuals per km2 in the Pench Tiger Reserve (Madhya Pradesh) or as high as 6.60 to 11.36 individuals per km2 and Ranthambhore National Park and 7 individuals per km2 in Keoladeo National Park (both in Rajasthan). Seasonal variations were noted in the Bardiya National Park (Nepal) in a 1980 study; the density 3.2 individuals per km2 during the dry season and 5 per km2 in April (the start of the dry season). In southern Texas, densities were found to be nearly 3‚Äì5 individuals per km2 in 1976. Historic notes mention nilgai in southern India, but these may have been feral: Threats and conservation Nilgai in the Gir National Park, Gujarat (India) The nilgai is categorised as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural resources (IUCN). While it is common in India, the nilgai occurs sparsely in Nepal and Pakistan. The major reasons behind its decimation in these two countries and extinction in Bangladesh are rampant hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation in the 20th century. As of 2008, the feral population in Texas was nearly 37,000. Wild populations also exist in the US states of Alabama, Florida and Mississippi and the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, where they have escaped from private exotic ranches. The population around the Texas-Mexico border is estimated to be around 30,000 (as of 2011). In India, the nilgai is protected under Schedule III of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. Major protected areas for the nilgai across India include: Gir National Park (Gujarat); Bandhavgarh National Park, Bori Wildlife Sanctuary, Kanha National Park, Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve, Panna Tiger Reserve, Pench Tiger Reserve, Sanjay National Park, Satpura National Park (Madhya Pradesh); Tadoba Andhari Reserve (Maharashtra); Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, Sultanpur National Park in Gurgaon, Ranthambore National Park and Sariska Tiger Reserve (Rajasthan). Interactions with humans Tamed nilgai in Gwalior district Remains of nilgai have been excavated at Pandu Rajar Dhibi (West Bengal, India), suggesting that they were domesticated or hunted in eastern India in the Neolithic period (6500‚Äì1400 BCE) and during the Indus Valley Civilisation (3300‚Äì1700 BCE) in the Indian subcontinent. There is a reference to the nilgai in the Aitareya Brahmana (a Hindu religious text dated 500‚Äì1000 BCE), where one of the Prajapatis (progenitor god) is said to have assumed the form of a nilgai: Nilgai illustrated by Ustad Mansur for Jahangir (1605‚Äì27), c. 1620 Nilgai are extensively featured in paintings, dagger hilts and texts from the Mughal era (16th to 19th centuries); their representation, however, is less frequent than that of horses and camels. On being disturbed while hunting nilgai, the Mughal emperor Jahangir recorded his ire: For centuries Indian villagers have associated the nilgai with the cow, a sacred animal revered by Hindus, and the name (\\"gai\\" means \\"cow\\" in Hindi) indicates the similarity they saw with the cow. The nilgai is rarely consumed by Hindus due to its religious significance. Tribes such as the Bishnois traditionally take care of wild animals like the nilgai. The nilgai was not widely hunted until the 20th century, when habitat degradation and poaching became rampant. The meat of nilgai is said to be lighter and milder flavoured than blackbuck meat. =Culling and conservation= The populations of nilgai in India are so large that farmers in the states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have pleaded to the government to cull them. Nilgai herds raid and trample crop fields across these states, often causing food shortages. Farmers use live electric wires to guard their farms, which kills other animals as well. Farmers in Neemuch (Madhya Pradesh) went on a hunger strike in 2015 demanding compensation for the damage caused by nilgai. Although blackbuck cause a similar problem, the damage caused by them is significantly lower as they merely break off young shoots. A 1990 study suggested culling, building enclosures for the antelopes and fencing off agricultural areas as remedies. The governments of Bihar, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand have urged the Government of India to declare the nilgai as vermin; the proposal has been implemented in Bihar, where nilgai can now be hunted to minimise the damages incurred by locals. The Uttar Pradesh government has given farmers and firearm licence holders the right to cull the animals. However, animal rights activists in various parts of India were unhappy with the decision. Shivanshu K. Srivastava, a columnist and social activist, wrote that \\"The culling of nilgais (blue bulls) in Bihar in July 2016 was so deplorable that it doesn't need any justification. The excuse given for this slew by the State government, the then environment minister Prakash Javadekar and the judiciary is so illogical that it mocks all the solutions available to stop the nilgais from destroying the farms. We live in the 21st century and culling is only the very last option we have. The farmers can either opt for fencing around the farmlands or if it's unaffordable, then the government can give ordinances to relocate them to the forests.\\" The state governments have attempted other initiatives to curb the nilgai: in November 2015, the Rajasthan government came up with a proposal to allow shooting nilgai with non-lethal darts to inhibit fertilisation in their bodies, so as to regulate their increasing populations. As the name \\"nilgai\\" appeals to the religious sentiments of Hindus, the Government of Madhya Pradesh has sought to officially rename it as rojad (Hindi for \\"forest antelope\\") and the Government of Haryana to rename it as roze in a bid to make their culling acceptable. In September 2019, a video surfaced of a nilgai being buried alive with an excavator in Bihar as part of the culling. The state forest department has claimed to have begun an investigation to find those responsible. A 1994 study drew attention to the ecological value provided by the nilgai in ravines lining the Yamuna River. In summer, the faeces of the antelope contained nearly 1.6 percent nitrogen, that could enhance the quality of the soil up to a depth of . Seeds in the droppings could easily germinate and assist in afforestation.

Sidesaddle riding is a form of equestrianism that uses a type of saddle which allows a rider (usually female) to sit aside rather than astride an equine. Sitting aside dates back to antiquity and developed in European countries in the Middle Ages as a way for women in skirts to ride a horse in a modest fashion while also wearing fine clothing. It has retained a specialty niche even in the modern world. History An early 19th-century English caricature, mocking women who rode astride. The joke is a play on the premise that the lady is looking for the way to \\"Stretchit\\". The earliest depictions of women riding with both legs on the same side of the horse can be seen in Greek vases, sculptures, and Celtic stones. Medieval depictions show women seated aside with the horse being led by a man, or seated on a small padded seat (a pillion) behind a male rider. Ninth century depictions show a small footrest, or planchette added to the pillion. These designs did not allow a woman to control a horse; she could only be a passenger. Equestrian portrait of Catherine the Great, as a young woman, riding sidesaddle. She also rode astride. In Europe, the sidesaddle developed in part because of cultural norms which considered it unbecoming for a woman to straddle a horse while riding. This was initially conceived as a way to protect the hymen of aristocratic girls, and thus the appearance of their being virgins. Further, long skirts were the usual fashion and riding astride in such attire was often impractical, awkward, and could be viewed as immodest. However, women did ride horses and needed to be able to control their own horses, so there was a need for a saddle designed to allow control of the horse and modesty for the rider. The earliest functional \\"sidesaddle\\" was credited to Anne of Bohemia (1366‚Äì1394). It was a chair-like affair where the woman sat sideways on the horse with her feet on a small footrest. The design made it difficult for a woman to both stay on and use the reins to control the horse, so the animal was usually led by another rider, sitting astride. The insecure design of the early sidesaddle also contributed to the popularity of the Palfrey, a smaller horse with smooth ambling gaits, as a suitable mount for women. A more practical design, developed in the 16th century, has been attributed to Catherine de' Medici. In her design, the rider sat facing forward, hooking her right leg around the pommel of the saddle with a horn added to the near side of the saddle to secure the rider's right knee. The footrest was replaced with a \\"slipper stirrup\\", a leather-covered stirrup iron into which the rider's left foot was placed. This saddle allowed the rider both to stay on and to control her own horse, at least at slower speeds. However, not all women adopted the sidesaddle at all times. Women such as Diane de Poitiers (mistress to Henry II of France) and Marie Antoinette were known to ride astride. Catherine the Great of Russia went so far as to commission a portrait showing her riding astride wearing a male officer's uniform.Fraser, Antonia. The Warrior Queens Anchor: Reprint edition, 1990 Mrs. Esther Stace riding sidesaddle and clearing at the Sydney Royal Easter Show, 1915, a feat made possible because of the leaping horn =Two pommel design= An antique two pommel sidesaddle. Off-side view of a two pommel sidesaddle with double rigging and an overgirth strap In the 1830s, Jules Pellier invented a sidesaddle design with a second, lower pommel to the sidesaddle. In this design, still in use today, one pommel is nearly vertical, mounted approximately 10 degrees left of top dead center and curved gently to the right and up. The rider‚Äôs right leg goes around the upright, or fixed pommel, which supports the right thigh of the rider when it is lying across the top center of the saddle. The lower right leg rests along the shoulder of the left (near) side of the horse and up against the second pommel (called the leaping head or leaping horn) which lies below the first on the left of the saddle. It is mounted about 20 degrees off the top of the saddle. This pommel is curved gently downward in order to curve over the top of the rider's left thigh, and is attached in a manner so that it can pivot slightly, to adjust to the individual rider. The rider places her left leg beneath this pommel, with the top of the thigh close or lightly touching it, and places her left foot in a single stirrup on that side. The impact of the second pommel was revolutionary; the additional horn gave women both increased security and additional freedom of movement when riding sidesaddle, which allowed them to stay on at a gallop and even to jump fences while fox hunting and show jumping. With this design, nearly all recreational equestrian pursuits were opened to women, yet they could also conform to expectations of modesty. For example, a world record in sidesaddle show jumping was set at at a horse show in Sydney, Australia in 1915. The leaping horn was the last major technological innovation for the sidesaddle and remains the core of basic design even for saddles of contemporary manufacture made with modern materials. Attire Modern English sidesaddle riding habit. The riding habit worn by women riding sidesaddle originally was similar to clothing worn in everyday life. It was not until the second half of the 16th century that a riding habit specifically designed for sidesaddle riding was introduced, though sidesaddle habit design still tended to follow fashion of the day. In 1875, the first safety skirt was introduced and later evolved into the open- sided apron. Sidesaddle habits, also known as riding habits, developed as women became more active in the hunting field. The development of the leaping head on sidesaddles allowed women to jump fences while hunting. Cumbersome skirts were gradually replaced by the apron still worn today‚Äîwhich is actually a half skirt worn over breeches; designed so the rider does not sit on any apron fabric. The sidesaddle apron can be attached to the right foot by a piece of elastic to hold it in place when riding. When dismounted the apron is wrapped behind the legs and attached to a button on the left hip to give the impression of a skirt. In the early 20th century, as it became socially acceptable for women to ride astride while wearing split skirts, and eventually breeches, the sidesaddle fell out of general use for several decades. The rise of women's suffrage also played a role as women rejected traditional restrictions in their physical activities as well as seeking greater social, political and economic freedoms.\\"Sidesaddles and suffragettes - the fight to ride and vote\\" October 17, 2008. Accessed June 10, 2010 However, there remained a place for sidesaddle riding in certain traditional and ceremonial circumstances, and aficionados kept the tradition alive until the sport enjoyed a revival beginning in the 1970s.  Riding techniques  Lateral movement. Left hand holds the reins while the right hand gently uses the whip in place of the missing right leg. Ideal position in the saddle, the rider's spine aligns with that of the horse left Correct leg position. Toe of right foot is up, heel down thumb Riding correctly is critical to protect the horse from injury as well as for the safety of the rider. Because both legs of the rider are on the same side of the horse, there is considerable concern that too much weight will be placed on only one side of the horse, which can cause physical harm to the animal. In addition, if a rider is not balanced, a sidesaddle may need to be cinched up far tighter than would a regular saddle, leading to discomfort in the animal and even possible breathing difficulties. Correct posture is essential for balance and security in a sidesaddle and is specifically judged in sidesaddle classes. The rider sits squarely on the horse with the spine of the rider centered over the spine of the horse. The shoulders and hips are square to the horse, not twisted or turned off-center. The hands must be carried square to the horse, keeping both reins at the same length and tension. Only one stirrup is used and it places the rider's heel higher on the horse's body than when riding astride. The left ankle is flexed and the heel of the left leg is kept down for proper balance, accurate contact with the horse, and correct placement in the stirrup. For modern riders, there are competing schools of thought as to the position of the right leg. Some argue that the right heel is also to be flexed down and the toe up, the same as when riding astride, while others argue that the toe of the right leg should be pointed down. Advocates for each toe position both argue that the position is required to maintain correct balance and make effective use of the leg muscles. In either case, when needed, the rider can squeeze her right (top) leg downwards and against the upper pommel, and her left (bottom) leg upwards into the leaping head to create an extremely strong grip. It is tiring for both the rider and the horse to maintain this emergency hold, however, and most riders rely upon good position, balance, and coordination to maintain their seat. The spur and the whip are employed as supportive riding aids, in addition to weight and seat, used in a humane manner for cueing, not punishment. The English rider's whip is carried on the off (right) side, and is used in place of the rider's right leg to cue the horse on the off side. The sidesaddle whip is between two and four feet long, depending on style of equipment and competition rules, when applicable. Western riders generally use the romal (a type of long quirt attached to the end of a set of closed reins) to support cues in place of the right leg. If the rider wears a spur to assist the use of her leg, she will wear only one, on the left boot. Riders hold the reins evenly, not allowing one rein to be longer than the other. Most sidesaddle designs also force the rider to carry her hands a bit higher and farther from the horse's mouth than in a regular saddle. Because high hands on a direct pressure bit such as the snaffle bit may encourage the horse to carry its head too high, use of bits with curb bit pressure, such as a pelham bit or a double bridle, which help the horse lower its head to a proper position, are often seen in sidesaddle competition. The horse used in sidesaddle riding will have additional training to accustom it to the placement of the rider and the use of the whip to replace off side leg commands. The horse also may need to adapt to a different and higher hand position. However, most well-trained horses adapt to the basics fairly quickly and generally can be used for riding both sidesaddle and astride. In the past, when the sidesaddle was common, it was recommended to frequently change from one side to another, to prevent irregular development of thigh muscles, especially in girls who start riding in childhood;Emma Elizabeth Walker, \\"Beauty Through Hygiene: Common Sense Ways to Health for Girls\\", 1904, pp. 58 this would be impossible with the usual modern design of sidesaddle, unless the rider had available two sidesaddles, one left-sided and one right-sided. Sidesaddle today Queen Elizabeth II, riding sidesaddle, Trooping the Colour, 1986 While sidesaddles came to be regarded as a quaint anachronism, some modern riders have found new applications in the horse show ring, in historical reenactments, and in parades or other exhibitions. The modern sidesaddle rider may be seen in many equestrian disciplines, including dressage, eventing, show jumping, western pleasure, and saddle seat-style English pleasure. Specialty sidesaddle classes with either traditional equipment or period costume are popular at many horse shows. Another common place to see a sidesaddle is the fox hunting field, where the tradition is preserved by sidesaddle devotees. More recently, a small number of gutsy sidesaddle riders have also taken up steeplechasing and flat racing with the creation of several side saddle steeplechases in Britain and the US. Riders with certain types of physical disabilities also find sidesaddles more comfortable than riding astride, and they are found useful by some people who have lost part of a leg. In addition, the sidesaddle has become a part of some therapeutic riding programs, because the design of the saddle provides extra security to certain types of riders. =Competition= Rider jumping in a sidesaddle. Sidesaddle rider without coat or apron in warm- up ring prior to competition, showing breeches and boots worn under riding apron, plus leg position on a sidesaddle with a leaping horn. Many horse shows include judged exhibitions (\\"classes\\") of sidesaddle riding. Sidesaddle classes are judged on manners and performance of the horse and rider, suitability of specific style, and appointments. English classes English sidesaddle classes are based on style and norms found in the hunting field before the Second World War. Dress, appointments, riding style, and even the type of horse used are all judged against a formalized standard for an \\"ideal\\" appearance. The riding habit in such classes is the formal attire found in the hunting field, starting with a coat and apron. The apron used is based on the open-sided safety apron developed in the late 19th century. The rider wears ordinary breeches or jodhpurs, over which she will wear the apron, which can partially open in the back. The jacket is usually cut a bit longer than a standard riding jacket. A vest, shirt, choker or stock tie, gloves, boots, and riding breeches are similar to those used when riding astride. For classes on the flat, a derby or top hat is traditional. When jumping, however, tradition gives way to safety, and most riders use a modern equestrian helmet, which is often mandatory equipment in competition rules. The saddle seat variation of English sidesaddle, now seen almost exclusively in the United States in certain breed shows, allows riders to emulate the \\"Park\\" riders who rode flashy, high-stepping horses on the flat, often in public parks. The sidesaddle is essentially the same, and the rider may wear almost the same attire as the \\"hunt\\" version, an apron with breeches underneath, but with a coat having a noticeably longer cut, sometimes in bright colors, sometimes with a contrasting lining, and either a top hat or a derby. The shirt and vest will be of the style used in astride saddle seat classes, in that the vest will match either the coat or the coat lining, the shirt is a standard menswear dress shirt, and a \\"four-in-hand\\" tie is worn. When show rules permit, some saddle seat style riders adopt a period costume, often based on an antique riding habit from the Victorian era. Western classes Western sidesaddle classThe western sidesaddle class is similar to the English class but with a sidesaddle having western design features, and riders wearing western style clothing. Riders generally wear a western-styled apron with belt, worn over some type of breeches or pants, but a modified two-leg chaps design in leather or ultrasuede is sometimes seen, though not legal in some types of competition. Period costumes are also seen in the western show ring. Western riders usually wear a short bolero-style jacket that matches the apron or skirt, often with elaborate decoration, gloves, cowboy boots and a cowboy hat. A variation to western-style sidesaddle riding is to wear Spanish or Mexican style regalia, often based on historic designs.  Men  Writer and horsewoman Rita Mae Brown (feminist) once stated, \\"If the world were a logical place, men would ride side saddle.\\"\\"What Quote\\". Accessed June 10, 2010 There are occasional examples of men riding sideways or sidesaddle on a horse other than for humorous, drag, or satirical purposes: * During World War II when riders laid field telephone cable from a cable-drum on the back of a galloping horse.Daily Telegraph September 2009 supplement \\"World War II Eyewitness Experience\\", page 22 * Sometimes farm workmen riding very wide-backed draft horses bareback to or from the fields found it easier to sit sideways than astride. * In the Macedonian front in World War I, in Salonica, which was a main Allied base area: Greek soldiers riding on horses which were equipped with heavy wooden packsaddles instead of riding saddles.Daily Telegraph Thursday 23 December 1915, reprinted in Daily Telegraph Wednesday 23 December 2015 page 36 * Some modern male riders with certain types of back injuries also claim riding sidesaddle is helpful. *In northern Morocco, where mules are still sometimes used to carry water from wells and for working small farms, sitting sideways on a mule with a packsaddle has been observed.

These were manufactured in America for middle class women and many still exist today.Although sidesaddles are still manufactured today, it is a small niche market, and a new model is quite expensive. Thus, many riders who wish to ride sidesaddle are often found hunting for older saddles at antique shops, estate sales, attics or barn lofts. It is difficult to find an antique sidesaddle that not only fits the rider and horse but also is in good condition. Old sidesaddles usually need reconditioning, sometimes even requiring complete removal of the leather and examination of the tree. Antique sidesaddles are frequently a problem to fit, as many are too narrow for modern horses.The sidesaddle tree must be fitted to the horseModern sidesaddles are usually based on the Jules Pellier two pommel design. The underlying tree, girthing system, flap or fender design, styling features and type of leather used may differ, however, the structure of the fixed pommel and leaping horn is a consistent design feature across all riding styles. Sidesaddles built on a tree designed for sidesaddle use are properly balanced, but many modern sidesaddles are built on a modified astride tree, which may result in an unbalanced, unridable saddle.Side Saddle Trees Historical reenactment participants, notably those in American Civil War reenactments, also tend to use the two pommel sidesaddle, since the single pommel sidesaddle that was used into mid-19th century is now regarded as creating an insufficiently secure seat for safe riding. Most sidesaddles have a regular girth or cinch, an overgirth that holds the flaps down, and most have either a back cinch or a balancing strap to hold the saddle down in the back and provide additional stability. =Other equipment= A breastcollar can be added to stabilize the saddle, and, though seen less often, a crupper. There are few differences in the bridles used for sidesaddle and astride riding. Because riders' hands are farther from the horse's mouth as the riders are seated further back than when astride, bridles may require reins that are a longer than standard astride reins. This is most often a problem for western-style riding with romal reins, which are sized for astride riders and sometimes require extensions for use by sidesaddle riders. =Fitting= A sidesaddle is measured by length and two width measurements, \\"neck\\" and \\"seat\\" The saddle must fit horse and rider. The sidesaddle tree differs from an astride tree, most notably by the structure of the pommels but also due to a much longer saddle point on the left side of the saddle.Whippy Tree Horses are fitted in a manner similar to that of a regular saddle; the gullet must clear the withers, and the bars of the saddle should be the proper width to be comfortable on the horse.http://www.sidesaddle.com/reference_pages/tree_types/fit.htm The seat is measured for the rider in three places: Length, from the front of the fixed pommel to the end of the cantle; width across the widest part of the seat; and the distance across the narrowest part of the seat, called the \\"neck\\". To determine the correct seat length, which is based on the length of the rider's femur, a person sits on a stool or chair with their back and hips against a wall or flat surface, and the length of a saddle is ideally one inch longer than the distance from the wall to the back of the person's knee. Riders can more easily manage a saddle that is a bit too large than one that is too small, though a too-large saddle may leave the rider with an insecure seat.Measuring a rider Equestrienne au Cirque Fernando, by Fran√ßois Flameng, c. 1890 File:Chess queen of walrus tusk 13th century.jpgA chess queen of walrus tusk, used in Sweden from about 1250 See also *Equestrianism *Horses in the Middle Ages *Riding habit *Saddle Notes References * Isabelle Veauvy, Adela√Øde de Savray et Isabelle de Ponton d‚ÄôAm√©court, Cavali√®res amazones : une histoire singuli√®re, Paris, Swan, 2016, 279 p., 35 cm (). * \\"The Evolution of Women of Horseback\\" by Margaret Bennett, Canadian Horse Annual, 1999 * Corsetsandcrinolines.com Victorian sidesaddle riding habit * users.tinyworld.co.uk History of Riding Habits * The N.E.A.

Lynch (right), Clerk of the Privy Council, and in the presence of Governor General Micha√´lle Jean (seated, centre), at Rideau Hall, 14 August 2007 The Canadian Oath of Allegiance is a promise or declaration of fealty to the Canadian monarch, as personification of the Canadian state, taken, along with other specific oaths of office, by new occupants of various federal and provincial government offices, members of federal, provincial, and municipal police forces, members of the Canadian Armed Forces, and, in some provinces, all lawyers upon admission to the bar. The Oath of Allegiance also makes up the first portion of the Oath of Citizenship, the taking of which is a requirement of obtaining Canadian nationality. The vow's roots lie in the oath taken in the United Kingdom, the modern form of which was implemented in 1689 by King William II and III and Queen Mary II and was used in Canada prior to Confederation. The Canadian oath was established at that time in the British North America Act, 1867 (now Constitution Act, 1867), meaning that alteration or elimination of the oath for parliamentarians requires a constitutional amendment. The Oath of Allegiance has also been slightly altered and made or removed as a requirement for admission to other offices or positions through Act of Parliament or letters patent, to which proposals have been put forward for further abolishment or modification. Composition The present form of the Oath of Allegiance, which derives from that which was, and still is, taken by parliamentarians in the United Kingdom, is: A person may choose to replace the word swear with affirm, and to omit the phrase so help me God. The oath taker is also given the option of either swearing on a holy book or not. The oath for senators and members of parliament has stood the same since confederation; according to Section IX.128 of the Constitution Act, 1867: \\"Every member of the Senate and the House of Commons of Canada shall before taking his Seat therein take and subscribe before the Governor General or some Person authorized by him, and every Member of a Legislative Council or Legislative Assembly of any Province shall before the Lieutenant Governor of the Province or some Person authorized by him, the Oath of Allegiance contained in the Fifth Schedule to the Act.\\" The oath set out in said schedule is: I, [name], do swear, that I will be faithful and bear true Allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, with the further instruction that \\"the name of the King or Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland for the Time being is to be substituted from Time to Time, with Proper Terms of Reference thereto.\\" The oath thus presently reads as follows: In French, this is: For those parliamentarians whose religion prohibits the swearing of oaths, there exists a compromise affirmation, first instituted in 1905: Purpose The Oath of Allegiance was implemented to secure the supremacy of the reigning monarch of Canada, the giving of faithfulness to whom is a manifestation of a key responsibility central to the Canadian system of government, and serves to \\"remind individuals taking it of the serious obligations and responsibilities that he or she is assuming.\\" Allegiance is not, however, given to that royal figure as an individual so much as to the Crown and other institutions and concepts the sovereign represents within both the federal and provincial spheres, including the state, its constitution and traditions, unity, authority, and democracy, as well as, in the military context, the highest authority in the Canadian Forces. Further, within Canada's constitutional system, \\"the oath to the Queen is in fact an oath to a domestic institution that represents egalitarian governance and the rule of law\\". The oath also acts as the legal basis of ministerial responsibility for those being sworn into the Privy Council to sit in the Cabinet. Former Premier of Ontario Mike Harris said in 1993: \\"The oath to the Queen is fundamental to the administration of the law in this country. It signifies that, here in Canada, justice is done‚Äînot in the name of the Prime Minister, or the Mayor, or the Police Chief, as in totalitarian nations‚Äîbut by the people, in the name of the Queen,\\" while James Robertson stated that the oath was the way elected members of parliament‚Äîwho are assuming positions of public trust‚Äîpromise to carry out their duties \\"patriotically, and in the best interests of the country.\\" The Federal Court also expressed that giving allegiance to the sovereign was \\"a solemn intention to adhere to the symbolic keystone of the Canadian Constitution, thus pledging an acceptance of the whole of our Constitution and national life,\\" though also reflecting: \\"It may be argued that it strikes at the very heart of democracy to curtail collective opposition and incentive for change by demanding loyalty to a particular political theory.\\" The relationship between the oath taker and the monarch is a complex one with roots reaching back to historical periods when a monarch ruled and accepted an oath of fealty from his or her subjects. The modern oath remains both fiduciary and reciprocal; mirroring citizens' oaths to the monarch, the sovereign takes the Coronation Oath, wherein he or she promises \\"to govern the Peoples of... Canada... according to their respective laws and customs.\\" It has been said of this mutual verbal contract: \\"except through the person of the Queen, Canada cannot take an oath to Canadians in return. It doesn't exist in the sense that it can take an oath. It is fundamental to our tradition of law and freedom that the commitments made by the people are reciprocated by the state. Reciprocal oaths are essential to our Canadian concept of government.\\" For members of the Canadian Forces, the oath to the monarch is \\"the soldier's code of moral obligation.\\" Administration of the oath Micha√´lle Jean reciting the Oath of Allegiance as she is sworn in as the 27th Governor General of Canada, 27 September 2005 =Crown appointees= The letters patent issued in 1947 by King George VI outline that the Oath of Allegiance must be taken by a newly appointed governor general and stipulate that the oath must be administered by the chief justice or other judge of the Supreme Court of Canada in the presence of members of the Queen's Privy Council. In the 19th century, the oath was recited by recently commissioned federal viceroys at whatever port they arrived at in Canada. However, the contemporary practice is to swear-in governors general as part of a ceremony in the Senate chamber on Parliament Hill. New members of the Queen's Privy Council recite, along with the Oath of Office, a specific oath that contains a variant on the Oath of Allegiance, as administered by the Clerk of the Privy Council, usually in the presence of the governor general at Government House in Ottawa. Twice, however, the oath has been delivered in front of the reigning monarch: In 1967, the year of Canada's centennial, the provincial premiers then in office were sworn in as members of the Privy Council before Elizabeth II in a ceremony on Parliament Hill and, during her tour of Canada to mark the 125th anniversary of Confederation, new appointees to the Privy Council recited the oath before the Queen at her Ottawa residence. The chief justice of the Supreme Court similarly recites the Oath of Allegiance in front of the governor general. =Parliamentarians= The Clerk of the House, or an authorized designate, administers the Oath of Allegiance to both new and returning members of parliament. Failure to take the oath constitutes an absolute bar on sitting or voting in parliament, along with a denial of the associated salary; this does not mean the person ceases to be a member of the house, simply that they cannot sit or participate in it. In 1875, George Turner Orton, member for Wellington Centre, inadvertently failed to swear the oath. Though Orton did eventually take his Oath of Allegiance, the matter was referred to the Select Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections, which found that the votes Orton cast in the house prior to his swearing the oath were rendered invalid. The only way to change this stipulation would be to amend the constitution, though it is not entirely clear whether or not this could be done under the general amending formula (through resolutions of parliament and of the legislatures of at least two-thirds of the provinces having at least 50% of the population), or if it would necessitate the undivided agreement of all the parliamentary houses across Canada, as is required for any constitutional alteration that affects the Crown. A breach of the oath can also be seen as an act punishable by the denial of the offender's ability to sit in the House of Commons. Actions such as making treasonous comments in a time of war could be considered a break of the oath, as the oath to the monarch is considered an oath to the country, but expressing anti- confederation sentiments is not, so long as the proponent continues to work for their cause within the laws and customs of Canada. Also, the Queen could remain head of any new state formed after secession from Canada. As early as 1867, this notion was tested; Joseph Howe was an opponent to confederation, but was elected to the House of Commons and took the Oath of Allegiance, after which he continued to work towards dissolving the union. Later, in 1976, members of the sovereigntist Parti Qu√©b√©cois (PQ) were elected to the National Assembly of Quebec; according to press reports, some of those persons swore the oath with their fingers crossed and others later added flippant commentary to their oath, such as \\"et aussi au Roi de France\\" (\\"and also to the King of France\\") and \\"Vive la R√©publique\\" (\\"live the republic!\\"), or whispered the words \\"Sa Majest√© la Reine √âlisabeth II\\". In 2003, Premier of Quebec Bernard Landry, leader of the PQ, added to the oath \\"for the duration of the present constitutional order, which will hopefully change one day in a democratic fashion.\\" None of the actions had any effect on the enforcement of the oath itself, however. =Canadian Armed Forces members= Allegiance and loyalty to the monarch, and the manner in which they are expressed, are specifically outlined in the Canadian Armed Forces regulations and subordinate orders. Within the Queen's Regulations and Orders, it is stipulated that all Canadian citizens or British subjects who enroll in the forces must take the Oath of Allegiance before either a commissioned officer or a justice of the peace. \\"I ......... (full name), do swear (or for a solemn affirmation, \\"solemnly affirm\\") that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, Her heirs and successors according to law. So help me God.\\" Those who are not Canadian citizens or British subjects must recite a longer oath: I, [name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will well and truly serve Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, Her heirs and successors according to law, in the Canadian Forces until lawfully released, that I will resist Her Majesty's enemies and cause Her Majesty's peace to be kept and maintained and that I will, in all matters pertaining to my service, faithfully discharge my duty. So help me God. The words so help me God are omitted if a solemn affirmation is taken. Those required to take the oath The following persons must take the Oath of Allegiance before occupying a governmental, military, police, or judicial post. Generally, these individuals are appointed by the monarch or relevant viceroy, meaning they serve at Her Majesty's pleasure, and are charged with creating or administering the law. =Federal= * Governors general of Canada * Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada * Senators * Members of parliament * Clerk of the House of Commons * Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada * Justices of the Federal Court of Appeal * Justices of the Federal Court * Justice of the Tax Court of Canada * Citizenship Judges * All employees of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service * Recruits of the Canadian Armed Forces * Members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police * Officers of the Canada Border Services Agency * Locally engaged staff at Canada's foreign missions who are Canadian citizens *Employees of Correctional Service Canada =Provincial= * Lieutenant governors * Members of a legislature (MLAs, MPPs, MNAs, and MHAs) * Justices of the appellate courts, superior courts, and provincial courts * Justices of the Peace in British Columbia * Auditor General of Ontario * Staff of the civil service in Ontario, British Columbia, and Manitoba * All other Crown appointees in Ontario * All police officers, railway constables, special constables, and reserve and auxiliary constables in British Columbia * All police officers, bylaw enforcement officers, and special constables in Nova Scotia * Community peace officers in the province of Alberta * All police officers in Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Alberta * Mayors and councillors in Nova Scotia * Medical examiners and investigators in Manitoba * Sheriffs in Newfoundland and Labrador * Lawyers in Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, Manitoba, and Prince Edward Island * Notaries public in Newfoundland and Labrador =Territorial= * Commissioners and deputy commissioners of the territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. * Members of the Executive Council of Nunavut * Members of the Legislative Assemblies of Nunavut and Yukon * Mayors, municipal councilors, and alderman of Yukon * Coroners of Yukon * Lawyers in Northwest Territories and Nunavut Optional * Board members of a regional district in British Columbia * Lawyers in Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Yukon * Police officers, special constables, and auxiliary constables in Ontario * Mayors and councillors in British Columbia * School trustees in British Columbia Opposition and augmentation Early opposition to the Oath of Allegiance was expressed by the inhabitants of Quebec shortly following the transfer of that territory from King Louis XV to King George III via the 1763 Treaty of Paris. The Quebec Act, issued in 1774, subsequently established a special Oath of Allegiance for the Roman Catholics of Quebec that, unlike the one sworn by others, which had remained the same since the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, bore no references to the Protestant faith. It read: :I [name] do sincerely promise and swear, That I will be faithful, and bear true Allegiance to his Majesty King George, and him will defend to the utmost of my Power, against all traitorous Conspiracies, and Attempts whatsoever, which shall be made against his Person. Crown. and Dignity; and I will do my utmost Endeavor to disclose and make known to his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, all Treasons, and traitorous Conspiracies, and Attempts, which I shall know to be against him, or any of them; and all this I do swear without any Equivocation, mental Evasion, or secret Reservation, and renouncing all Pardons and Dispensations from any Power or Person whomsoever to the contrary. So help me God. In 1970, the recently elected members of the sovereigntist Parti Qu√©b√©cois refused to recite the Oath of Allegiance before taking their seats in the National Assembly of Quebec. At the time, all the other parties in the assembly agreed that the oath was outdated and needed to be amended. The Act Respecting the National Assembly of Quebec was granted Royal Assent in 1982, in which a supplementary oath pledging loyalty to the \\"people of Quebec\\" was included. The Members' Manual of the National Assembly outlines that this additional oath is to the people and constitution of Quebec, distinct from the Oath of Allegiance, which is an oath to the country via the Queen, though some saw the monarch, in that context, as representative of the Quebec state and not of Canada, taking into account Canada's \\"divisible\\" Crown. Also, Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Dominic Agostino proposed in 1996 that the Legislative Assembly of Ontario follow that of Quebec and add another requisite oath of allegiance to Canada, to be taken by MPPs following the oath to the sovereign. However, the Standing Committee on the Legislative Assembly found that the monarch referred to in the Oath of Allegiance was already the personification of the Canadian state and it was thus redundant to offer allegiance to both the Queen and to Canada. Amendments have also been proposed in the federal scope, though the same difficulty in altering the constitution thwarted any changes, leading members of parliament (MPs) in Ottawa to table various bills that sought to alter the Parliament of Canada Act, instead. While none were ever successful, certain MPs have recited further pledges in the presence of their constituents or added their own pledge after reciting the Oath of Allegiance. In 2005, Senator Raymond Lavigne uttered the words \\"and to my country, Canada,\\" at the end of the Oath of Allegiance, which raised questions from other senators and Lavigne was instructed to take the oath again, without the amendment. Following this, the Senator proposed that the Senate rules be changed to add an oath to Canada after the oath to the sovereign, in the form of: \\"I, [name], do swear (or solemnly affirm) that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Canada.\\" The motion never passed. All members of the federal Civil Service were previously required to take the Oath of Allegiance before being officially hired, a stipulation that prompted Pierre Vincent, a civil servant of Acadian descent who refused to swear the oath, to undertake a three-year legal challenge against the Public Service Commission. The latter found that Vincent could keep his job with the Civil Service and, though the Supreme Court ruled that civil servants continued to be employees of the monarch, Royal Assent was granted to the Public Service Modernization Act in 2003, which removed the necessity of the bureaucratic civil servants to take the oath to their employer. The inclusion of the Oath of Allegiance in the Oath of Citizenship has also met with opposition, though this was never a constitutional matter, instead falling within the scope of the Citizenship Act.

From its origins in mid-19th-century Russia, it has become popular around the world, with considerable variation from the original recipe. History The dish is named after one of the members of the influential Stroganov family. []Anne Volokh, Mavis Manus,The Art of Russian Cuisine. New York: Macmillan, 1983, p. 266, A legend attributes its invention to French chefs working for the family, but several researchers point out that the recipe is a refined version of older Russian dishes. Recipe from A Gift to Young Housewives (1887 edition) Elena Molokhovets's classic Russian cookbook A Gift to Young Housewives gives the first known recipe for Govjadina po-strogonovski, s gorchitseju, \\"Beef √† la Stroganov, with mustard\\", in its 1871 edition. A Gift to Young Housewives, English translation: The first edition (1861) did not include Beef Stroganoff, which first appeared in the 1871 edition (Volokh, 1983), (Syutkin, 2015). The 1912 recipe mentioned by Toomre is in Alekandrova-Ignatieva, 1912, p. 611, but was also published in earlier editions. The recipe involves beef cubes (not strips) prepared in a dry marinade of salt and allspice, and then saut√©ed in butter. The sauce is a simple roux mixed with prepared mustard and broth, and finished with a small amount of sour cream: no onions, no mushrooms and no alcohol. In 1891, the French chef Charles Bri√®re, who was working in Saint Petersburg, submitted a recipe for beef Stroganoff to a competition sponsored by the French magazine L'Art culinaire. This led Larousse Gastronomique to assume that he was the inventor of this dish, but both the recipe and the name existed before then. Saut√©ing of beef Stroganoff Another recipe, this one from 1909, adds onions and tomato sauce, and serves it with crisp potato straws, which are considered the traditional side dish for beef Stroganoff in Russia. [] The version given in the 1938 Larousse Gastronomique includes beef strips, and onions, with either mustard or tomato paste optional. After the fall of Tsarist Russia, the recipe was popularly served in the hotels and restaurants of China before the start of World War II.Frank Dorn, The Dorn Cookbook. Chicago: Henry Regnery Company, 1953, pp. 126‚Äì127 Russian and Chinese immigrants, as well as US servicemen stationed in pre-Communist China, brought several variants of the dish to the United States, which may account for its popularity during the 1950s. It came to Hong Kong in the late fifties, with Russian restaurants and hotels serving the dish with rice but not sour cream. Around the world Beef Stroganoff preparation varies significantly not only based on geography, but based on other factors as well, such as the cut of meat and seasonings selected. Meat for the dish can be cut in different ways and is sometimes diced, cubed, or cut into strips. Some variations include mushrooms and onions or other vegetables and varied seasonings such as sugar, salt, black pepper, and bottled marinades (especially Worcestershire sauce) and rubs. Beef Stroganoff atop pasta In the version often prepared in the United States today in restaurants and hotels, it consists of strips of beef filet with a mushroom, onion, and sour cream sauce, and is served over rice or noodles. In the UK and Australia, a recipe very similar to that commonly found in the United States has become popular, generally served with rice and sometimes with pasta as well as in commercially prepared frozen dishes. Today, the dish is generally served over wide or twisted egg noodles in the United States. British pubs usually serve a version of the dish with a creamy white wine sauce, whereas more \\"authentic\\" versions are often red stews with a scoop of sour cream separately served on top. Beef Stroganoff cooked with paprika and served with rice Larousse Gastronomique lists Stroganov as a cream, paprika, veal stock and white wine recipe. The Brazilian variant includes diced beef or strips of beef (usually filet mignon) with tomato sauce, onions, mushrooms and heavy cream. Brazilians also prepare Stroganoff with chicken or even shrimp instead of beef. It is commonly served with a side of shoe-string potatoes and white rice. In Brazilian Portuguese it is called Strogonoff or Estrogonofe. Stroganoff is also popular in Nordic countries. In Sweden, a common variant is korv Stroganoff (sausage Stroganoff; sv), which uses the local falukorv sausage as a substitute for the beef. In Finland, the dish is called makkara-stroganoff, makkara meaning any kind of sausage. Beef Stroganoff is, however, also a common dish. Diced brined pickles are also a normal ingredient in Finnish Stroganoff. Stroganoff's popularity extends to Japan, where it is most commonly served with white rice, or white rice seasoned with parsley and butter. Its popularity increased dramatically with the introduction of \\"instant sauce cubes\\" from S&B; Foods. These are cubes with dried seasoning and thickening agents that can be added to water, onion, beef, and mushrooms to make a Stroganoff-style sauce. Additionally, Japanese home recipes for Stroganoff frequently call for \\"non-traditional\\" Russian ingredients, such as small amounts of soy sauce.

Early life and education Mattis attended the University of California at Berkeley. While still a student in 1995, he developed the first version of GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), along with his roommate Spencer Kimball. Mattis was also a member of a student club at Berkeley called the eXperimental Computing Facility (XCF). Mattis graduated from Berkeley in 1997 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. According to Mattis in 1999: On free software and the motivations to write it and what makes good and enduring free software: Career Mattis was previously employed as an engineer for Google, and is credited for his work Google Servlet Engine as well as helping spearhead Colossus, a new version of the Google File System. In 2013, Mattis launched the company Viewfinder along with Kimball and Brian McGinnis, formerly of Lehman Brothers. The company developed an app that allowed social media users to share photos, chat privately, and search photo history without leaving the app. The company was acquired by Square, Inc. in December 2013. Mattis moved to Square's New York City office where he became a senior member of the company's East Coast team. While at Google, Mattis used a database known as Bigtable, and followed the development of its next generation, known as Spanner. The database organizes data between thousands of servers to allow Google applications to stay online, even if an entire data center were to go offline. Mattis wanted to use this software but found there was nothing available outside of Google as either closed or open source that was similar. He launched CockroachDB as an open source project on GitHub with Kimball, along with ex-Google Reader team member Ben Darnell. They later formed the company Cockroach Labs in order to accelerate development of the CockroachDB software.

The company was founded by Nozomu Matsumoto in 1938 in Tokyo as a radio and speaker repair shop. Its current president is Susumu Kotani. Pioneer played a role in the development of interactive cable TV, the Laser Disc player, the first automotive Compact Disc player, the first detachable face car stereo, Supertuner technology, DVD and DVD recording, the first AV receiver with Dolby Digital, plasma display (with the last 2 years of plasma models being branded as Kuro, lauded for their outstanding black levels) and Organic LED display (OLED). The company works with optical disc and display technology and software products and is also a manufacturer. Sharp Corporation took a 14% stake in Pioneer in 2007, which has been reduced to 9%, but Sharp still remains the largest shareholder of Pioneer Corporation, followed by Honda Motor Co., Ltd. who owns roughly 4% of Pioneer shares following a memorandum between the two companies in 2010 to strengthen business ties. In March 2010, Pioneer stopped producing televisions as announced on 12 February 2009. On June 25, 2009, Sharp Corporation agreed to form a joint venture on their optical business to be called Pioneer Digital Design and Manufacturing Corporation. In September 2014, Pioneer agreed to sell Pioneer Home Electronics (Home A/V) to Onkyo, and in March 2015, Pioneer sold its DJ equipment business division to KKR, which resulted in the establishment of Pioneer DJ as a separate entity, independent of Pioneer.

Sussel. Among the most famous and successful recording artists on Laurie's roster were Dion and the Belmonts (both together and as separate acts), The Chiffons, The Jarmels, The Mystics, Bobby Goldsboro, and The Royal Guardsmen. History Sussel's earlier record company, Jamie Records (named after his elder daughter), had been unsuccessful, and as a result, Sussel (1924‚Äì2003) joined forces with Gene Schwartz (1920‚Äì1999) to found Laurie Records, named after his other daughter, Laura Sue Sussel. By the early 1960s, Elliot Greenberg, an arranger and friend of Schwartz's, gained a 12% ownership of the company, and Gene's younger brother Bob Schwartz also became involved. Songwriter Ernie Maresca also played an active role in the company.Mike Callahan and David Edwards, The Laurie Story, BSN, 2009. Retrieved 2 July 2020 The company grew to include subsidiary labels, most notably Andie Records, named after Sussel's youngest daughter, Andrea Jo Sussel; it later changed its name to Rust Records. Dion and the Belmonts were responsible for the first of Laurie's hit singles with their 1958 doo-wop song, \\"I Wonder Why\\". Using top New York session musicians in leading recording studios, and produced by Gene Schwartz, Dion and the Belmonts had several national hits on Laurie. When Dion started a solo career, the hits on Laurie continued with \\"Runaround Sue\\" and \\"The Wanderer\\". The label had continuing success especially with the Chiffons (\\"He's So Fine\\" and \\"One Fine Day\\", both 1963), and the Royal Guardsmen (\\"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\\", 1966). Then, when Dion's returned to the company after several years with Columbia, he had further success with \\"Abraham, Martin and John\\" (1968). The company also licensed English records during the British Invasion period, including \\"Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying\\" (1964) and \\"Ferry Cross the Mersey\\" (1965) by Gerry and the Pacemakers. Jo Siopis, a well known record producer and wife of Gerry & the Pacemakers' bass player, Les Chadwick, was instrumental in the distribution of Laurie Records albums in the United States. Being a small independent record label, Laurie's chart successes usually occurred one at a time and, for the most part, with one-off hits, as was the case with the Mystics, Randy & the Rainbows, and the Jarmels. Another sizable hit for the label was the controversial song \\"Once You Understand\\", written and produced by the songwriting team of Lou Stalmman and Bobby Susser and released by the duo in 1971 under the pseudonym Think. In 1966, Laurie released a psychedelic single, \\"Charity\\" by the Gray Things, which appears on multiple compilation albums, including Mindrocker, a 13-CD anthology of US 1960s psychedelic recordings released in Germany in 1982. \\"Charity\\" was issued in limited quantities but it remains popular today via multiple YouTube posts.An internet search of \\"The Gray Things\\" with either \\"Charity\\" or \\"on Laurie Records\\" will confirm compilation albums and multiple You Tube\\" posts which, in many cases, provides the compilation album cover with the post. The label also distributed records under several subsidiary labels, including Rust, Legrand, Calico, President, Providence, Dolphin (not to be confused with the Liberty-owned Dolphin/Dolton label). Laurie changed its name in the early 1980s to 3C Records. 3C stands for Continental Communications Corporation and the master recordings that 3C produced are owned by the Capitol Records unit of Universal Music Group. Label variations The label variations for Laurie singles were of three types: First, a grey label with Laurie Records written across the top. This was used for first release only, #3013. It then changed to a sky blue label, with the same basic printing of Laurie Records, from #3014 thru #3020. After the first few singles had been released, it changed to the typically recognized label of four red corners with the black square at the hole punch, with Laurie written at the top, from #3021 onward. Of those earlier releases, only #3013 and #3015, both releases by Dion & the Belmonts, were regular re-issues as part of the more familiar label design.

It is located at the north end of the River Adur gap in the South Downs, four miles (6.4 km) north of Shoreham-by-Sea. The smaller villages of Bramber and Upper Beeding constitute, with Steyning, a built-up area at this crossing-point of the river.  Demography  The parish has a land area of . In the 2001 census 5,812 people lived in 2,530 households, of whom 2,747 were economically active.  History  Possible tombstone of √Üthelwulf, King of Wessex, in the church porch ‚Äì the two incised crosses may indicate a royal burial =Saxon= The church of St Andrew and St Cuthman, Steyning Steyning has existed since Anglo-Saxon times. Legend has it that St Cuthman built a church, at one time dedicated to him, later to St Andrew, and now jointly to St Andrew and St Cuthman, where he stopped after carrying his mother in a wheelbarrow. Several of the signs that can be seen on entering Steyning bear an image of his feat. King Alfred the Great's father, √Üthelwulf of Wessex, was originally buried in that church, before being transferred to Winchester ‚Äì a Saxon grave slab (possibly his) remains in the church porch. =Norman= To thank his Norman protectors for refuge during his exile, Edward the Confessor granted his royal minster church in Steyning, with its large and wealthy manor lands, to the Abbey Church of the Holy Trinity at F√©camp, to take effect after the death of Aelfwine, the Bishop of Winchester, who had charge of Steyning. The bishop died in 1047 and ecclesiastical jurisdiction then passed directly to the Pope. (In the same way, F√©camp Abbey itself answered to no Norman bishop, only to the Pope.) This was confirmed in a charter by William. Confirming the gift of Steyning, made by Edward the Confessor, this charter acquitted the grantees of all earthly service and subjection to barons, princes and others, and gave them all royal liberties, custom and justice over all matters arising in their land, and threatened any who should infringe these liberties with an amercement of ¬£100 of gold.From: Regesta Regum Anglo-Normannorum 1066‚Äì1154 Volume I, edited by H W C Davis (Oxford, 1913) This was an addition to the nearby port with land around Rye, Winchelsea and Hastings, already given to the same Abbey by King Cnut, to honour a promise made by his wife Emma of Normandy's first husband King Aethelred. By then Steyning was already a thriving and important port with a market, a royal mint, the church founded by St Cuthman and one other church, as Domesday Book relates 60 years later. Godwin, Earl of Wessex expelled the Norman monks in 1052 and seized Steyning for himself, and his son Harold decided to keep it upon his accession. This made commercial and strategic sense as Harold did not want a Norman toehold in a potential invasion port, but William responded by swearing on a knife before setting out for England to recover it for the monks: :Of the land of Steyning [county of Sussex]; the Duke gave seisin to the Church by the token of a knife, before he went to England; the grant to take effect if God should give him victory in England. :Witnesses: Aymeri the vicomte; Richard fitzGilbert; Pons.Regesta Regum Anglo- Normannorum 1066‚Äì1154 Volume I, edited by H W C Davis (Oxford, 1913) Medieval cottages on the corner of Church Street and High Street This gained him a ship from F√©camp and, upon his victory at Hastings, he honoured his promise and returned it to the monks. However, its strategic importance made William place William de Braose in a new castle at nearby Bramber, who began a vigorous boundary dispute and power tussle with the monks, William's settlement having lacked definite terms in the first place. Domesday Book, completed in 1086, brought this to a head. It found that de Braose had built a bridge at Bramber and demanded tolls from ships travelling further along the river to the port at Steyning. The monks challenged Bramber's right to bury its parishioners in the churchyard at William de Braose's new church of St Nicholas, and demanded its burial fees, despite it being built to serve the castle not the town. The monks produced forged documents to defend their position and were unhappy with the failure of their claim on Hastings.The monks claimed the same freedoms and land tenure in Hastings as King Edward had given them at Steyning. Though on a technicality William was bound to uphold all aspects of the status quo before Edward's death, the monks had already been expelled 10 years before that death. King William wanted to hold Hastings for himself for strategic reasons and ignored the problem until 1085, when he confirmed their Steyning claims but swapped the Hastings claim for land in Bury (near Pulborough). In 1086 the king called his sons, barons and bishops to court (the last time an English king presided personally, with his full court, to decide a matter of law) to settle this. It took a full day, and the Abbey won over the court, forcing de Braose to curtail his bridge tolls, give up various encroachments onto the abbey's landsIncluding a rabbit warren, a park, eighteen burgage plots, a causeway and a channel to fill his moat and organise a mass exhumation and transfer of all Bramber's dead to the churchyard of Saint Cuthman's Church in Steyning. =Mid to Late Medieval= The Old Workhouse, Mouse Lane Even the 1086 judgment did not settle the Steyning versus Bramber dispute once and for all; it continued for centuries afterwards, exacerbated by the Lord of Bramber founding his own religious establishments in his neighbouring parish. Meanwhile, in the 14th century, the River Adur began to silt up and the town's use as a port became difficult leading to a loss of trade and population. The monks of F√©camp Abbey retained control of Steyning until the 15th century, and re-dedicated the church of St Cuthman to St Andrew in the 13th century. Steyning began returning two members of parliament from 1278 and as a rotten borough made up of a depopulated port became similar to Dunwich until the Reform Act 1832. =17th century= In 1614, William Holland, Alderman of Chichester founded and endowed Steyning Grammar School.http://steyningmuseum.org.uk/brotherhood.htm =19th century= Map of Steyning from 1946 The Steyning Line railway from London to Shoreham arrived in Steyning in 1861 and a station was opened to serve the town, see the black line and station in the map displayed. Steyning Town Hall, (currently an estate agents) at 38 High Street, was built in 1886. The legendary Irish politician Charles Stewart Parnell married 'Kitty' O'Shea (niece of Lord Hatherley) here in 1891, the culmination of an adulterous affair that saw his fall from power, catastrophically dividing Irish politics. Besides much agriculture, brewing, a tannery (Tanyard Lane) and to a small extent brickmaking, more than 25 men were employed in the sheep related trade as fellmongers, more than four were parchment makers, five were millers and there was a surgeon, an oil painter, James M. Burfield, and a watch maker in the town during the 1881 census.http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Search/frameset_search.asp?PAGE=census/search_census.asp 1881 Census from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints The railway remained in service for over a century, closing in 1966 as result of the Beeching Axe. The route of the railway line has since been converted into a footpath and cycleway known as the Downs Link. The nearest railway station to the town today is Shoreham-by-Sea Modern town The Clock Tower in Steyning High Street In Steyning there is access to a variety of facilities including four public houses, many boutique shops, cafes and four estate agents. There is a leisure centre, which was built with National Lottery funding. It has a modern health centre, a public library and the Steyning Museum. A spring fair is held on the Spring bank holiday (the last Monday in May) The Monarch's Way long-distance footpath skirts the southern end of the town. Schools The town is home to Steyning Grammar School, now a comprehensive school of 2,500 pupils founded in the Stuart period, see above, with a sixth form comprising over 400 pupils. The school has a catchment area that extends as far as Dial Post and sometimes Worthing. And it also has a primary school (400 pupils) and a pre-school. Towers Convent School, a Catholic independent day and boarding school, is located in nearby Upper Beeding. It educates girls from pre-prep to age 16 and boys up to age 8. Steyning Festival The Steyning Festival was founded in 2006 by Ann Poupard, a resident of the town. The event is now biennial and runs for two weeks at the end of May/start of June. It features theatre, music, literature, talks, walks, community events and more. In 2009, the Steyning Festival was awarded a lottery grant to bring international artist and psychogeographer Chris Dooks to Steyning for a month-long residency, resulting in a free MP3 tour. Sport and leisure There is a long established cricket club near the police station. Steyning has a non-league football club called Steyning Town Community Football Club, who play at the Shooting Field. The town also has its own leisure centre. Steyning Athletic Club, established in 1951, offers a variety of sports to members - including Running, Swimming, Cycling, Race walking, Circuits/Fitness and Triathlon. Annual Club events include the Roundhill Romp (10k running race that is part of the Sussex Fun Run League) and the Steyning Stinger (Full Marathon and Half Marathon on the South Downs).  Nightlife  Steyning has four pubs (the Star Inn, the Chequer Inn, the White Horse and the Norfolk Arms), as well as a number of restaurants.

Longo began racing in 1975 and was active in cycling through 2012. She was once widely considered the best female cyclist of all time, although that reputation is now clouded by suspicion of doping throughout her career. She is famous for her competitive nature and her longevity in a sport where some of her competitors were not yet born during her first Olympic competition in 1984. She was selected to compete for France in the 2008 Olympics, her seventh Olympic Games. She had stated that this would be her final participation in the Olympics.\\"A French Cyclist‚Äôs Long Ride\\", New York Times, 28 July 2008. In the Women's road race, she finished 24th, 33 seconds behind winner Nicole Cooke, who was one year old when Longo first rode in the Olympics. At the same Olympics, she finished 4th in the road time trial, just two seconds shy of securing a bronze medal. She is currently number two on the all-time list of French female summer or winter Olympic medal winners, with a total of four medals including one in gold, which is one less than the total number won by the fencer Laura Flessel-Colovic. Career Longo about to start the time trial stage of the 2001 Women's Challenge Longo was born in Annecy, Haute- Savoie, in the French Alps where she began her athletic career as a downhill skier. After winning the French schools' ski championship and three university skiing championships, she switched to cycling at the urging of her coach (and later husband) Patrice Ciprelli. Within a few months, Longo won the French road race Championship at the age of 21. She competed both in road and track bicycle racing events, and is an Olympic gold-medalist and thirteen-time world champion. =Doping affairs= In September 1987 Longo tested positive for ephedrine following a 3 km world record attempt in Colorado Springs. She served a 1-month ban for this offense. In September 2011, French sports daily L'Equipe reported that Longo's husband, Patrice Ciprelli, had purchased her the performance-enhancing drug EPO from China via former American professional cyclist Joe Papp. Ciprelli claimed that he purchased the EPO for his own personal use. The charges prompted an investigation of Longo by the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de Cyclisme (FFC)http://velonews.competitor.com/tag/jeannie-longo which cleared her in a November 2011 statement. Longo also missed three doping tests in this same time period. Normally this would be penalized the same as a positive test but AFLD had failed to notify Longo that she would be targeted for testing in that year, thus letting her off.

From 1721 on they were educated in special \\"canton schools\\" (–ö–∞–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Å–∫–∏–µ —à–∫–æ–ª—ã) for future military service (the schools were called garrison schools in the 18th century). The canton schools were eventually abolished in 1857. Cantonist schools during the 18th and early 19th centuries Cantonist schools were established by the 1721 decree of Tsar Peter the Great that stipulated that every regiment was required to maintain a school for 50 boys. Their enrollment was increased in 1732, and the term was set from the age of 7 to 15. The curriculum included grammar and arithmetic, and those with a corresponding aptitude were taught artillery, fortification, music and singing, scrivenery, equine veterinary science, or mechanics. Those lacking in any talent were taught carpentry, blacksmithing, shoemaking and other trades useful to the military. The ablest ones were taught for additional 3 years, until the age of 18. All entered military service at the completion of their studies. The decree of 1758 required all male children of the military personnel to be taught in the cantonist schools. In 1798 a military \\"asylum-orphanage\\" was established in St Petersburg, and all regimental schools were renamed after it, the total enrollment reaching 16,400. The schools were reorganized in 1805 and all children were now referred to as cantonists. After the War of 1812 their number increased dramatically, when many orphaned children of military personnel killed in the war enrolled in cantonist schools voluntarily. During this period the curriculum of cantonist schools was equivalent to that of gymnasia, and military subjects were not taught. In 1824 all cantonist schools were made answerable to the Director of Military Settlements Count Aleksey Arakcheyev, and in 1826 they were organized into cantonist battalions. The standards of curriculum dropped significantly, and it was limited to the subjects useful to the military. During the reign of the Nicholas I of Russia the number of cantonists reached 36,000. Several cantonist battalions became specialized: they prepared auditors, artillerists, engineers, military surgeons, cartographers. More children were added to the category of cantonists. Eventually children of the discharged soldiers were also included, illegitimate children of soldiers' partners or widows, and even foundlings. There were several exemptions: #Legitimate sons of staff-officers, and all officers awarded the Order of St. Vladimir 4th class. #A single son of a junior staff-officer, out of a total number of his children, if he had no sons born after his attainment of the officer's rank. #A single son of a junior officer maimed in battle. #A single son of a widow of a junior officer or an enlisted man killed in action or deceased during service. There were considerable differences in cantonists' service obligations: * Children of nobility were required to serve for 3 years at the completion of their studies. * Children of senior officers - 6 years. * Children of clergy - 8 years. * All other social categories - 25 years. Cantonism and ethnic minorities There was forcible conscription of underage recruits from the populations of indigenous peoples, Old Believers, Gypsies, and common vagabonds from 1805, Jews from 1827, and Poles from 1831.\\"–∫–∞–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—ã\\", an article from the Shorter Jewish Encyclopedia, vol. 4, 1988, published online by the Electronic Jewish Encyclopedia There were some significant differences in treatment of Jews and non-Jews: all others were required to provide conscripts between 18 and 35, while for Jews the age limit was 12‚Äì25, and it was left to the discretion of the Jewish qahal to choose conscripts from whatever age they decided. Thus in practice, Jewish children were often conscripted as young as eight or nine years old.The World of Hasidism: H. Rabinowicz, 1970, p. 132, Hartmore House, London This system created a disproportionate number of Jewish cantonists, and betrayed the utilitarian agenda of the statute: to draft those more likely to be susceptible to external influence, and thus to assimilation. =Jews= After 1827, the term was applied to Jewish and Karaite boys,Shaul Stampfer: Karaite Separatism in Nineteenth-Century RussiaJoseph Solomon Lutski's Epistle of Israel's Deliverance, Philip E. MilleJoseph Solomon Lutski, Russian Review, Vol. 54, No. 4 (October 1995), pp. 628‚Äì630 who were drafted to military service at the age of twelve and placed for their six-year military education in cantonist schools. Like all other conscripts, they were required to serve in the Imperial Russian army for 25 years after the completion of their studies (in 1834 the term was reduced to 20 years plus five years in reserve and in 1855 to 12 years plus three years of reserve).Jerome Blum (1971) Lord and Peasant in Russia: From the Ninth to the Nineteenth Century, , pp. 465, 466 According to the \\"Statute on Conscription Duty\\" signed by Tsar Nicholas I of Russia on August 26 (September 7 new style), 1827, Jews were made liable to personal military service and were subject to the same conscription quota as all other tax-paying estates (\\"sosloviya\\") in the Russian Empire. The total number of conscripts was uniform for all populations (four conscripts per each thousand subjects); however, the actual recruitment was implemented by the local qahals and so a disproportionate number of Jewish conscripts were underage. –ö–∞–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—ã (Cantonists) article in the Electronic Jewish Encyclopedia, based on the Shorter Jewish Encyclopedia. Jerusalem, 1976-2005: the Society for Research on Jewish Communities in cooperation with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem In the aftermath of the Polish uprising of 1831, children of political prisoners and boys on the streets of captured cities often were abducted, and placed in cantonist schools, with the intent of their Russification, see Incorporation of Polish children into the Imperial Russian Army (1831-1832) for more. The vast majority of Jews entered the Russian Empire with the territories acquired as the result of the last partitions of Poland of the 1790s; their civil rights were severely restricted (see Pale of Settlement). Most lacked knowledge of the official Russian language. Before 1827, Jews were doubly taxed en lieu of being obligated to serve in the army http://www.imha.ru/knowledge_base/base-6/1144527479-evrei-v-russkoj-armii-i- unter-trumpeldor.html and their inclusion was supposed to alleviate this burden. However, the number of recruits reduced the number of young men that could go into the workforce, and this in combination with political restrictions led to widespread destitution. Russia was divided into northern, southern, eastern, and western \\"conscription zones\\" and the levy was announced annually for only one of them. The Pale of Jewish settlement was outside conscription in the fallow years, so the conscription in general and of cantonists in particular occurred once every four years, except during the Crimean War, when conscription was annual. The first 1827 draft involved some 1,800 Jewish conscripts; by the qahal's decision half of them were children. In 1843 the conscription system was extended to the Kingdom of Poland that was previously exempt from it. Strains within the Jewish community The 'decree of August 26, 1827' made Jews liable for military service, and allowed their conscription between the ages of twelve and twenty-five. Each year, the Jewish community had to supply four recruits per thousand of the population. Strict quotas were imposed on all communities and the qahals were given the unpleasant task of implementing conscription within the Jewish communities. Since the merchant-guild members, agricultural colonists, factory mechanics, clergy, and all Jews with secondary education were exempt, and the wealthy bribed their way out of having their children conscripted, fewer potential conscripts were available; the adopted policy deeply sharpened internal Jewish social tensions. Seeking to protect the socio-economic and religious integrity of Jewish society, the qahals did their best to include ‚Äúnon-useful Jews‚Äù in the draft lists so that the heads of tax-paying middle-class families were predominantly exempt from conscription, whereas single Jews, as well as \\"heretics\\" (Haskalah influenced individuals), paupers, outcasts, and orphaned children were drafted. They used their power to suppress protests and intimidate potential informers who sought to expose the arbitrariness of the qahal to the Russian government. In some cases, communal elders had the most threatening informers murdered (such as the Ushitsa case, 1836), see mesirah. The zoning rule was suspended during the Crimean war, when conscription became annual. During this period the qahals leaders would employ informers and kidnappers (Russian: \\"–ª–æ–≤—á–∏–∫–∏\\", lovchiki, khappers), as many potential conscripts preferred to run away rather than voluntarily submit. In the case of unfulfilled quotas, younger boys of eight and even younger were frequently taken. Training and pressures to convert Herzel Yankel Tsam, one of only eight recorded exceptions in the Russian army in the 19th century of Jewish cantonists who rose to the rank of officer without first converting to Christianity. Drafted as a 17-year-old cantonist, he became an officer in 1873. He was not allowed any promotions beyond captain until his retirement after 41 years of service, when he was given rank and pension of a colonel. In spite of pressures, he never converted.Zvi Y. Gitelman (2001): A Century of Ambivalence: The Jews of Russia and the Soviet Union, 1881 to the Present. Indiana University Press. . p.5Herzl Yankl Tsam (Beyond the Pale) All cantonists were institutionally underfed, and encouraged to steal food from the local population, in emulation of the Spartan character building. On one occasion in 1856, a Jewish cantonist Khodulevich managed to steal the Tsar's own watch during military games at Uman. Not only was he not punished, but he was given a reward of 25 roubles for his prowess.Petrovsky-Shtern, Yohanan (2008). Jews in the Russian Army, 1827-1917: Drafted into Modernity. Cambridge University Press. pp. 90‚Äì110. .http://loveread.ec/read_book.php?id=75283&p;=37 The boys in cantonist schools were given extensive training in Russian grammar (and sometimes literature), and mathematics, in particular geometry necessary in naval and artillery service. Those who showed aptitude for music were trained in singing and instrumental music, as the Imperial Army had a large demand for military wind bands and choirs. Some cavalry regiments maintained equestrian bands of torban players, and cantonist schools supplied these as well. Some cantonist schools also prepared firearms mechanics, veterinarians for cavalry, and administrators (\\"auditors\\"). The official policy was to encourage their conversion to the state religion of Orthodox Christianity and Jewish boys were coerced to baptism. As kosher food was unavailable, they were faced with the necessity of abandoning of Jewish dietary laws. Polish Catholic boys were subject to similar pressure to convert and assimilate as the Russian Empire was hostile to Catholicism and Polish nationalism. Initially conversions were few, but after the escalation of missionary activities in the cantonist schools in 1844, about one third of all Jewish cantonists would have undergone conversion. =Other= In the era of Arakcheev's military settlements (1809-1831) indigenous peasants who fell within the territory of a military settlement were subject to incorporation into the military in various ways. In particular, indigenous children (under the age of 18) considered as military cantonists, were divided into three age groups: minor (under the age of 7), middle (ages 8‚Äì12), and senior, with the latter group assigned to the military school of the settlement. Minors stayed with the parents, while minor orphans were transferred to military settlers, with an award of 10 roubles. All male newborns automatically became cantonists. Later it turned out that instead of 11 years, 8 years of military training were enough. Correspondingly, the age groups were changed: under 10, under 14, and under 18.–ù.–•. –¢—É—Ä–∫–µ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤, \\"–ì—Ä–∞—Ñ –ê—Ä–∞–∫—á–µ–µ–≤ –∏ –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è 1809-1831\\", 1871, modern reprint: , p. 109 In the aftermath of the Polish uprising of 1831, children of political prisoners and boys on the streets of captured cities were often abducted, and placed in cantonist schools, with the intent of their Russification, see Incorporation of Polish children into the Imperial Russian Army (1831-1832) for more. In the army For all cantonists, their 25-year term of service began after they reached the age of 18 and were recruited into the army. Discriminatory regulations ensured that unconverted Jews were held back in their army promotions. According to Benjamin Nathans, > \\"... the formal incorporation of Jews into Nicolas I's army was quickly > compromised by laws distinguishing Jewish from non-Jewish soldiers.

These restrictions were not lifted until the February Revolution in 1917. Some baptized cantonists eventually reached high ranks in the Imperial Army and Navy; among them were generals Grulev, Arnoldi, Zeil, Khanukov; admirals Kaufman, Sapsay, Kefali. =Literary references= The cantonists' fate was sometimes described by Yiddish and Russian literature classics. Alexander Herzen in his My Past and Thoughts described his somber encounter with Jewish cantonists. While being convoyed to his exile in 1835 at Vyatka, Herzen met a unit of emaciated Jewish cantonists, some eight years old, who were marched to Kazan. Their (sympathetic) officer complained that a third had already died.

Judah Steinberg described underage Jewish cantonists in his novel \\"In Those Days\\" (English translation in 1915, from the Hebrew).In Those Day: The Story of an Old Man The agony of Polish children incorporated into the Imperial Russian Army was presented in Juliusz S≈Çowacki's narrative poem Anhelli. Abolition and results of cantonist policy The cantonist policy was abolished by Tsar Alexander II's decree on 26 August 1856, in the aftermath of the Russian defeat in the Crimean war, which made evident the dire necessity for the modernisation of the Russian military forces. Nonetheless, the drafting of children lasted through 1859. All unconverted cantonists and recruits under the age of 20 were returned to their families. The underage converted cantonists were given to their godparents. However the implementation of the abolition took nearly 3 years. It is estimated that between 30,000 and 70,000 Jewish boys served as cantonists, their numbers were disproportionately high in relation to the total number of cantonists. Jewish boys comprised about 20% of cantonists at the schools in Riga and Vitebsk, and as much as 50% at Kazan and Kiev schools. A general estimate for the years 1840‚Äì1850 seems to have been about 15%. In general Jews comprised a disproportionate number of recruits (ten for every thousand of the male population as opposed to seven out of every thousand), the number was tripled during the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856). At the conclusion of the conscription term, former cantonists were allowed to live and own land anywhere in the Empire, outside the Pale of Settlement. The earliest Jewish communities in Finland were Jewish cantonists who had completed their service. The rate of conversion was generally high, at about one third, as was eventual intermarriage.

Koelewijn is also a successful producer and songwriter for other Dutch artists. His most famous song is \\"Kom van dat dak af\\". Biography Peter Koelewijn was born on 29 December 1940, the son of a fishmonger in the southern Dutch city of Eindhoven. At the age of thirteen, he received his first guitar. In 1957, he started writing his first songs in English. He started his first band at secondary school with guitarists Karel Jansen and Roelof Egmond and singer Anneke Gr√∂nloh. Later on, Harry van Hoof (who later became a famous conductor), and drummer Peter van der Voort, joined the band. Around the same time, Gr√∂nloh left the band. = 1959‚Äì1969: Kom van dat dak af! = In 1959 the band, now called 'Peter and his Rockets', was joined by saxophone player Klaus Buchholz and bass guitarist Karel Jansen. In December, the band recorded \\"Kom Van Dat Dak Af\\" for record company Bovema. The combination of American rock and roll and Dutch lyrics was quite revolutionary at the time. In May 1960, \\"Kom Van Dat Dak Af\\" was a massive success in both the Netherlands and Belgium. Koelewijn, who moved on to grammar school, was told by his parents that he had to finish his schooling. Peter and His Rockets signed at Philips. Follow-up singles \\"Laat Me Los\\" (\\"Let Me Go\\") and \\"Marijke\\" charted lower. By 1967 Koelewijn disbanded the Rockets to focus on writing and producing for other artists; he also hosted radio shows. =1970s: Glamrock and first album= Peter and his Rockets in tv-show Op losse groeven (1971) In 1970, he reformed the Rockets for what would become his glam rock era; this period lasted five years. His 1973 composition, \\"Klap Maar in Je Handen\\" (\\"Clap Your Hands and Stamp Your Feet\\") was a no. 1 hit for South African singer Maria in South Africahttp://www.rock.co.za/files/springbok_top_20_(M).html South African Charts: Maria and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where it is still very popular at dances. In 1977, Koelewijn released his debut solo album Het Beste in Mij Is Niet Goed Genoeg Voor Jou (The Best I Can Give Is Still Unworthy Of You) which spawned two singles; the Rockets-like \\"Je Wordt Ouder Papa\\" (\\"You're Growing Older Papa\\"; a jocular comment by Golden Earring guitarist George Kooymans) and \\"KL 204 (Als Ik God Was)\\", originally intended as the lead single and reissued in 1990. Engelbert Humperdinck recorded the English version The Road To Nowhere, although Koelewijn had done likewise at the start. Flight 204 was released in 2019 on the bilingual album-reissue. = 1980s‚Äì1990s: New Rockets lineup and Gompie = In 1981, Koelewijn recruited musicians from the band Bunny for a new Rockets line-up that lasted till 1997; their first release was the live-album Peter Live of which \\"Kom Van Dat Dak Af\\" and \\"Klap Maar in Je Handen\\" hit the charts. In 1982, the band appeared in an insurance-commercial. Early 1985, Koelewijn had a top 40 hit with \\"Sprong in Het Duister\\" (\\"Leap in the Dark\\"), the lead single of his otherwise unsuccessful second solo album. In 1987, he released \\"De Loop Van Een Geweer\\" (\\"Barrel of a Gun\\") which was loosely based on The Commodores' \\"Nightshift\\". In 1995, Koelewijn fronted the novelty group Gompie; their version of Smokie's \\"Living Next Door to Alice\\" topped the charts. = 2000s‚Äì2010s: Annieversaries, awards, and tributes = In 2002, Peter and His Rockets reformed for seven shows. In 2007, Koelewijn received a lifetime achievement award. A tribute concert was held where he performed a few songs himself. In 2008, Koelewijn appeared at the 50th- anniversary concert for Dutch pop. He opened the show by performing \\"Kom Van Dat Dak Af\\" as a duet with singer-songwriter Boudewijn de Groot. In 2009, the year of his own 50th career anniversary, Koelewijn released a solo album titled Een Gelukkig Man (A Happy Man). Koelewijn was a chairman of Buma/Stemra. In 2011, Koelewijn appeared on the Ali B op volle toeren with rapper Typhoon. In 2013 he appeared in the Beste Zangers, selecting songs and cover versions from his own repertoire to be performed by the other contesters.

Ganas has non-egalitarian, tiered membership groups, and is thus a partial member at the Federation of Egalitarian Communities. The community uses a group problem-solving process called \\"Feedback Learning\\", which was begun by co-founder Mildred Gordon. The community attracted press attention after a 2006 shooting incident which led to lurid tabloid headlines. The community was founded by a group of six people, and has grown to consist of 10‚Äì12 core group members plus 60 to 70 members of varying involvement. There are three businesses run by Ganas, including a bookstore-cafe. History Ganas started in Staten Island in 1979 with six founders including Mildred Gordon and Jeff Gross. In 1973 Gordon left New York City where she had founded GROW, an unaccredited school of group therapy that \\"turned out unlicensed group psychotherapists.\\" Throughout 1972 GROW was the subject of state Attorney General and city fraud investigations into \\"fraudulent use of Ph.D.'s from unaccredited universities\\". Gordon went to San Francisco where she studied biofeedback which became the basis of what she termed \\"Feedback Learning\\". Gordon met the five people who would become the original core-group of the Ganas community and incorporated the tax-exempt 501(c)(3) non-profit organization Foundation for Feedback Learning (FFL) in 1974. The new community went by the name FFL until changing their name to Ganas in the early 1990s. In the late 1970s they returned to New York and moved into a Lower East Side apartment, finally settling in Tompkinsville, Staten Island in 1979. On Staten Island the core-group shares ownership of eight houses and three commercial buildings that house their retail stores. There are about 65 non-core group residents who live in Ganas houses and cover expenses by either paying rent or working in the stores. Culture Ganas operates on four primary rules forbidding violence, freeloading, illegal activities, and non-negotiable negativity (requiring that complaints be discussed in group process or not discussed at all either in private or public). The primary focus of Ganas is Feedback Learning, an \\"intense brand of communication\\" according to The New York Times, about which journalist Jonah Owen Lamb writes: \\"Those new to Ganas would share their life story with the group, who would respond by picking apart their issues and deciding how those issues should be dealt with. By 'killing their buddhas,' it was felt, Ganas members could begin to take control of how they reacted to the world.\\" Mildred Gordon describes Feedback Learning as an \\"indispensable day-to-day guiding experience\\" in which members of the community provide feedback‚Äîhelpful criticism‚Äîto each other. Through daily discussions of every community member's behaviour members can learn about themselves and their motivations, gain from hearing unpleasant truths, and \\"accept negative information with the excitement of discovery\\". Mildred Gordon left Ganas in 2001 but still returns weekly to conduct Feedback Learning sessions at the commune. Finances The \\"Every Thing Goes Book Cafe\\" on Staten Island Though Ganas is portrayed as a commune in the media, only the core group participates in income and property sharing. Ganas runs three stores under the name \\"Every Thing Goes\\" that are dedicated to the re- use and re-sale of used goods. The stores include a furniture store, a clothing store and a bookstore/cafe with a performance stage. The businesses support the community but are labor-intensive and only marginally profitable. For most of its life Ganas' income was declared on FFL's IRS form 990 for tax- exempt organizations. Since 2001 FFL has taken in an average of $475,000 in total annual revenue, including direct public support and program service revenue. FFL's program services are listed as \\"Feedback Learning Skills Development\\" and \\"Interpersonal Skills Development\\". FFL's revenues do not include income from their \\"Everything Goes\\" stores, as those are for-profit entities. In late 2006 the core group reorganized as Ganas Community LLC, and began a new business called Ganas Food Company LLC. Mildred Gordon continues to draw an annual salary of $40,000 as the executive director of FFL. In 2007 the legal address of FFL changed from Ganas headquarters on Staten Island to Brooklyn, and the same year FFL's tax return declared only $15,550 in total revenue and $75 in direct public support. The following year total revenue fell to $2295 with direct public support of $0. Ganas has a real estate portfolio estimated at $10 million with holdings in upstate New York, Brooklyn, Virginia, California and Spain.  Controversy  Two ex-members have made allegations about Ganas, including that it is a cult, that it pressures residents into sex and green-card marriages, and that \\"they control minds with drugs that are used by psychotherapists\\". Ganas opposes being described as a cult. =2006 shooting= In May 2006 Ganas co-founder Jeff Gross was shot outside of his home on Ganas property. Gross survived and at trial identified the shooter as Rebekah Johnson, a former member who lived at Ganas periodically until she was evicted in 1996. Johnson's attorney denied that she had shot Gross, but said that she was \\"wrongfully accused by Gross as payback for portraying him as a brainwashing rapist and the commune as a kinky cult.\\" Johnson had unsuccessfully sued the group for sexual harassment in 2000. In August 2008 Johnson was acquitted of all charges. Jeff Gross left the group after the shooting, and filed several lawsuits against Ganas and Rebekah Johnson. Gross claimed that the leadership rejected his requests that the group upgrade security, that his personal daily schedule was published in a Ganas newsletter, and that he was \\"booted out\\" of Ganas in October 2007. Gross is seeking damages totaling over $20 million.

Early years Viola Slaughter was born in Missouri to Amazon and Mary Ann Howell. She was the great-great- granddaughter of Daniel Boone. By the time Viola was eighteen, the Howell family had moved to a ranch near Roswell in the New Mexico Territory. It was while living there that Viola met John Slaughter, and they quickly fell in love. Viola would confess herself that \\"it was love at first sight\\" to a writer. John was thirty-seven and Viola only eighteen when they met. John had two small children from his first marriage to the former Eliza Adeline Harris, who died in 1877 of smallpox. Marriage Viola's mother vehemently opposed her daughter's interest in Slaughter. Her father, however, thought more positively about the relationship. By April 1879, Viola told her mother that she would marry John in about two weeks. Her mother screamed. With her father's blessing, the couple parted the next morning to Tularosa, also in the New Mexico Territory, where they wed on April 16. Motherly devotion Viola Slaughter wanted to be a mother all of her life; because of this, she admittedly took a motherly love towards John's two children. Slaughter would never become a natural mother, but she and John adopted several children, among them, an Apache baby girl found by Slaughter in Mexico. Apache May had been abandoned there. From Arizona and back Soon after marrying, the Slaughters arrived at Sulphur Springs, where they lived in a two-room house. This would mark the beginning of the relationship between her and John's two children, Addie and Willie. John told her that he would send them to Texas to live with his brother, Viola convinced him not to do so because she was already feeling love for the children. The Slaughters opened a supermarket near Tombstone in 1880. In order to get supplies, such as meat, the Slaughters had to travel through Apache territory, a trip which frightened Viola. In 1881, the Slaughters returned to New Mexico, by train. John needed more cattle for his ranch. During the return trip, the Slaughters faced a blizzard, and sixteen of the seventeen travellers in the Slaughter group suffered from frostbite. Only Addie Slaughter escaped unharmed. She was attached to a buffalo robe, which protected her from harm. Beginning in the spring of 1883, John took his family on a trip that he thought would land him in Oregon, where he dreamed of having a ranch by Snake River. His plans were ruined, however, when he began hemorrhaging while in Idaho from an old condition of tuberculosis. The Slaughters had to return immediately to Arizona. Soon, they purchased the San Bernardino Mexican land grant. Their new home was large enough to be located in two countries: half of the ranch was in the United States, the other half in Mexico. The San Bernardino Ranch had 65,000 acres (260 km2), which John had bought for one dollar and twenty five cents each. Sheriff's wife Although the house had been abandoned, and deteriorated, for fifty years, Viola Slaughter was very happy with her new house. She marveled at the views nearby and the fact that, just by walking from one side of the house to the other, she would be crossing countries every time. From 1886 to 1890, Slaughter lived in Tombstone, where he was the sheriff. However, they kept the ranch. In 1887, one of the few earthquakes in the history of Arizona destroyed part of the San Bernardino Ranch. Slaughter felt quite disappointed about his life as a rancher and decided to retire from being a working rancher once his days as sheriff were over. Viola, however, convinced him otherwise. She promised to help with the ranching and said, \\"just give me a plain house with wide board floors, muslin ceilings and board finish around the adobes. That's all I want\\". In 1892, the Slaughters, having remodeled their ranch, moved there permanently. Viola Slaughter also became famous across the west for her curing abilities, and cowboys would come from as far as New Mexico to get treatments from her. She also joined Slaughter on his frequent trips to Mexico; they helped catch a killer there, and usually brought cattle from as far as Hermosillo. Viola Slaughter would later tell Charles Morgan Wood that she heard one time that John had been killed in Mexico by Apaches, and she got on a wagon and headed towards the frontier. Three days later, she saw her husband from afar. Viola was so happy that she felt ill, but she hid her weak feeling when her husband got to her, and he did not notice that she was not feeling good. In 1896, Slaughter went on the attack and followed Apaches to Mexico. Instead, he found the abandoned baby, Apache May. Wealth The Slaughters became wealthy. Viola was able to wear expensive dresses to dinner. The family dinners were equally known in Arizona society circles, as these usually included fresh vegetables, jam, cream, and other exquisite ingredients of the era. The Slaughters were known for being an affable family, and the San Bernandino Ranch became a hang-out place for the rich, the poor, neighbors, friends, and passersby who happened to come along and felt like talking to someone. Murder, death On May 4, 1921, a foreman, Jesse Fisher, was murdered at the San Bernardino Ranch by robbers. Slaughter believe that he was in danger; so he asked Fisher to check on the horses, and Slaughter moved into a bedroom without windows. Seconds later, Fisher was murdered. One of the killers was one of the Slaughters' adopted children, a fact which left the couple distraught. Convinced that they needed to leave the ranch, the Slaughters moved to Douglas. On his last overnight visit to the ranch in 1922, John Slaughter died there. Viola remained active, although she stayed in Douglas for the remainder of her life. She traveled for news interviews. In 1939, as the grand marshal of Douglas' town rodeo parade, she rode a horse through the streets of the border city. On February 27, 1941, Addie Slaughter suffered a fatal heart attack while visiting Viola. About a month later, overcome with depression, Viola herself died.

The content of an MHTML file is encoded using the same techniques that were first developed for HTML email messages, using the MIME content type \`multipart/related\`. MHTML files use a .mhtml or .mht filename extension. The first part of the file is an e-mail header. The second part is normally HTML code. Subsequent parts are additional resources identified by their original uniform resource locators (URLs) and encoded in base64 binary-to-text encoding. MHTML was proposed as an open standard, then circulated in a revised edition in 1999 as RFC 2557. The .mhtml (Web archive) and .eml (email) filename extensions are interchangeable: either filename extension can be changed from one to the other. An .eml message can be sent by e-mail, and it can be displayed by an email client. An email message can be saved using a .mhtml or .mht filename extension and then opened for display in a web browser or for editing other programs, including word processors and text editors. Browser support Some browsers support the MHTML format, either directly or through third-party extensions, but the process for saving a web page along with its resources as an MHTML file is not standardized. Due to this, a web page saved as an MHTML file using one browser may render differently on another. =Internet Explorer= As of version 5.0, IE was the first browser to support reading and saving web pages and external resources to a single MHTML file. =Opera= Support for saving web pages as MHTML files was made available in the Opera 9.0 web browser. From Opera 9.50 through the rest of the Presto-based Opera product line (currently at Opera 12.16 as of 19 July 2013), the default format for saving pages is MHTML. The initial release of the new Webkit/Blink-based Opera (Opera 15) did not support MHTML, but subsequent releases (Opera 16 onwards) do. MHTML can be enabled by typing \\"opera://flags#save-page-as-mhtml\\" at the address bar. = Google Chrome = Creating MHTML files in Google Chrome used to be supported by toggling the experimental \\"Save Page as MHTML\\" option by visiting the link \\"chrome://flags/#save-page-as-mhtml\\" since version 25.0 (which has been removed since version 75.0)https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/7696455?hl=en and an API for browser extension since version 35.0..

Exploits  In May 2015, a researcher noted that attackers could build malicious documents by creating an MHT file, appending an MSO object at the end (MSO is a file format used by the Microsoft Outlook e-mail application), and renaming the resulting file with a .doc extension. The delivery method would be by spam emails. In April 2019, a security researcher published details about an XML eXternal Entity (XXE) vulnerability that could be exploited when a user opens an MHT file. Since the Windows operating system is set to automatically open all MHT files, by default, in Internet Explorer, the exploit could be triggered when a user double-clicked on a file that they received via email, instant messaging, or another vector, including a different browser.

Its Origin and History to 1204\\". Speculum, Volume 24, Issue 2 (April 1949), 179. \\"Thereafter, the influx of Pechenegs and Cumans turned Bulgaria into a battleground between Byzantium and these Turkish tribes ...\\" After the Mongol invasion (1237), many sought asylum in the Kingdom of Hungary, as many Cumans had settled in Hungary, the Second Bulgarian Empire playing an important role in the development of the state, and Anatolia before the invasion. Related to the Pecheneg, they inhabited a shifting area north of the Black Sea and along the Volga River known as Cumania, from which the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks meddled in the politics of the Caucasus and the Khwarezm Empire. The Cumans were fierce and formidable nomadic warriors of the Eurasian steppe who exerted an enduring influence on the medieval Balkans. They were numerous, culturally sophisticated, and militarily powerful. Many eventually settled to the west of the Black Sea, influencing the politics of Kievan Rus', the Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia Principality, the Golden Horde Khanate, the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Kingdom of Serbia, the Kingdom of Hungary, Moldavia, the Kingdom of Georgia, the Byzantine Empire, the Empire of Nicaea, the Latin Empire and Wallachia, with Cuman immigrants becoming integrated into each country's elite. The Cumans also played a prominent role in the Fourth Crusade and in the creation of the Second Bulgarian Empire. Cuman and Kipchak tribes joined politically to create the Cuman‚ÄìKipchak confederation. The Cuman language is attested in some medieval documents and is the best-known of the early Turkic languages. The Codex Cumanicus was a linguistic manual written to help Catholic missionaries communicate with the Cuman people. Names and etymology =Cuman= Cuman appears in ancient Roman texts as the name of a fortress or gate. The Roman natural philosopher Pliny the Elder (who lived in the 1st century AD), mentions \\"a fortress, the name of which is Cumania, erected for the purpose of preventing the passage of the innumerable tribes that lay beyond\\" while describing the \\"Gates of Caucasus\\" (Derbent, or Darial Gorge),.Pliny the Elder, The Natural History of Pliny Volume 2 , p. 21. The Greek philosopher Strabo (died 24 AD) refers to the Darial Gorge (also known as the Iberian Gates or the Caucasian Gates) as Porta Caucasica and Porta Cumana. The original meaning of the endonym Cuman is unknown. It is also often unclear whether a particular name refers to the Cumans alone, or to both the Cumans and the Kipchaks, as the two tribes often lived side by side. In Turkic languages qu, qun, q≈´n, quman or qoman means \\"pale, sallow, cream coloured\\", \\"pale yellow\\", or \\"yellowish grey\\". While it is normally assumed that the name referred to the Cumans' hair, Imre Baski ‚Äì a prominent Turkologist ‚Äì has suggested that it may have other origins, including: * the color of the Cumans' horses (i.e. cream tones are found among Central Asian breeds such as the Akhal-Teke); * a traditional water vessel, known as a quman; or * a Turkic word for \\"force\\" or \\"power\\".Imre Baski, \\"On the ethnic names of the Cumans of Hungary\\", Kinship in the Altaic World: Proceedings of the 48th Permanent International Altaistic Conference, Moscow 10‚Äì15 July 2005 (eds Elena V. Boikova, Rosislav B. Rybakov) Wiesbaden, Harrassowitz Verlag, pp. 48, 52. Observing that the Hungarian exonym for Cumans ‚Äì i.e. Kun, Kunok ‚Äì appeared as Cunus, Cuni in the chronicles and was applied to earlier nomads such as Pechenegs or Oghuzes, Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy derived Kun from Huns, instead of Qun, which he kept separate from Kun. However, Istv√°n V√°s√°ry rejected Gy√∂rffy's hypothesis and contended that \\"the Hungarian name of the Cumans must go back to one of their self-appellations, i.e. to Qun.Istv√°n V√°s√°ry, Cumans and Tatars: Oriental Military in the Pre-Ottoman Balkans, 1185‚Äì1365, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 5. =Cumania= Even after the Cumans were no longer the dominant power in their territory, people still referred to the area as Cumania. The Armenian chronicler Hethum (Hayton) of Korykos referred to the Golden Horde Khanate as \\"Comania\\". The Moroccan traveler, Ibn Battuta said of Cumania: \\"This wilderness is green and grassy with no trees, nor hills, high or low ... there is no means of travelling in this desert except in wagons.\\" The Persian historian, Hamdallah Mustawfi (1281‚Äì1349), wrote that Cumania has a cold climate and that it has excellent pasturage and numerous cattle and horses. The 14th-century Travels of Sir John Mandeville, note that Cumania =Polovtsy= In East Slavic languages and Polish, they are known as the Polovtsy, derived from the Slavic root *polv—ä \\"pale; light yellow; blonde\\". Polovtsy or Polovec is often said to be derived from the Old East Slavic polov≈≠ (–ø–æ–ª–æ–≤—ä) \\"yellow; pale\\" by the Russians ‚Äì all meaning \\"blond\\". The old Ukrainian word polovtsy (–ü√≥–ª–æ–≤—Ü—ñ), derived from polovo \\"straw\\" ‚Äì means \\"blond, pale yellow\\". The western Cumans, or Polovtsy, were also called Sorochinetses by the Rus', ‚Äì apparently derived from the Turkic sary chechle \\"yellow-haired\\". A similar etymology may have been at work in the name of the ≈öƒÅrƒ´, who also migrated westward ahead of the Qun.Dobrodomov I. G., 1978, 123 However, according to O. Suleymenov polovtsy may come from a Slavic word for \\"blue-eyed\\", i.e. the Serbo-Croatian pl»Év (–ø–ª–∞Ãë–≤) means \\"blue\\", but this word also means \\"fair, blonde\\" and is in fact a cognate of the above; cf. Eastern Slavic polov≈≠, Russian pol√≥vyj (–ø–æ–ª–æÃÅ–≤—ã–π), Ukrainian polov√Ωj (–ø–æ–ª–æ–≤–∏ÃÅ–π).Rick Derksen, Etymological Dictionary of the Slavic Inherited Lexicon (Brill: Leiden-Boston, 2008), 412. Blonde individuals likely existed among the Kipchaks, yet anthropologically speaking the majority of Turkic peoples had East Asian admixture and generally Kimeks‚ÄìKipchaks were dark-haired and brown-eyed.Pletnyova, S. A. Kipchaks (1990). p. 35 An alternative etymology of Polovtsy is also possible: the Slavic root *p»çlje \\"field\\" (cf. Russian p√≥le), which would therefore imply that Polovtsy were \\"men of the field\\" or \\"men of the steppe\\" in contrast to the Lipovtsi. =Folban, Vallani, Valwe= In Germanic languages, the Cumans were called Folban, Vallani or Valwe ‚Äì all derivaties of Proto-Germanic root *falwa- meaning \\"pale\\" (> English \\"fallow\\"). In the German account by Adam of Bremen, and in Matthaios of Edessa, the Cumans were referred to as the \\"Blond Ones\\". =Kipchak= As stated above, it is unknown whether the name Kipchak referred only to the Kipchaks proper, or to the Cumans as well. The two tribes eventually fused, lived together and probably exchanged weaponry, culture and languages; the Cumans encompassed the western half of the confederation, while the Kipchaks and (presumably) the Kangli/Kankalis (possibly connected to three Pecheneg tribes known collectively as Kangars) encompassed the eastern half. This confederation and their living together may have made it difficult for historians to write exclusively about either nation. The Kipchaks' folk- etymology posited that their name meant 'hollow tree'; according to them, inside a hollow tree, their original human ancestress gave birth to her son.Julian Baldick, Animal and Shaman: Ancient Religions of Central Asia , p.55. Kamusella points to two Iranian words: kip \\"red; blonde\\" and cak/chak \\"Scythian\\". N√©meth points to the Siberian qƒ±pƒçaq \\"angry, quick-tempered\\" attested only in the Siberian Saƒüay dialect.Golden, Peter B. (1992). An Introduction to the History of the Turkic People.

Harrassowitz Verlag, Wiesbaden. p. 104-108 The writings of al-Marwazi (c. 1120) state that a Turkic \\"Qun\\" people (Hungarians called Cumans \\"Kun\\") came from the northern Chinese borders ‚Äì \\"the land of Qitay\\" (possibly during a part of a migration from further east). After leaving the lands of the Khitans (possibly due to Kitai expansion), the Qun entered the territory of the ≈†ari people, whom the Quns expelled. Marwazi wrote that the Qun were Nestorian Christians.Minorsky, V. (1942), Sharaf al-Zaman Tahir Marvazƒ´ on China, the Turks and India. Arabic text (circa A.D. 1120) with an English translation and commentary. London. 1, pp. 242‚Äì243. Golden surmised that these Quns might have sprung \\"from that same conglomeration of Mongolic peoples from which the Qita√± sprang\\";Golden, Peter B. (1992). An Introduction to the History of the Turkic People. Otto Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden. p. 273-274 however, Golden later suggested that the Quns were Turkic.Golden, Peter B. (2006). \\"Cumanica V: The Basmils and Qipchaqs\\" in Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi 15. p. The Syrian historian Yaqut (1179‚Äì1229) also mentions the Qun in The Dictionary of Countries, where he notes that \\"(the sixth iqlim) begins where the meridian shadow of the equinox is seven, six-tenths, and one-sixth of one-tenth of a foot. Its end exceeds its beginning by only one foot. It begins in the homeland of the Qayi, Qun, Khirkhiz, Kimak, at-Tagazgaz, the lands of the Turkomans, FƒÅrƒÅb, and the country of the Khazars.\\"Yaqut, Kitab mu'jam al- budan, p. 31. The Armenian historian, Matthew of Edessa (died 1144), also mentioned the Cumans, using the name œáarte≈°, meaning \\"blond\\", \\"pale\\", \\"fair\\". Kipchak relationship It cannot be established whether the Cumans conquered the Kipchaks, if the ≈†ari whom the Quns had defeated were to be identified as Kipchaks,Golden, Peter B. (1992). An Introduction to the History of the Turkic People. Otto Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden. p. 276 \\"The attempts, on philological grounds, to link the Quman-Qun-S√¢r√Æ and Qƒ±pƒçaqs, while possible, seem somewhat forced. Corroborating historical data are needed. If the T√ºrkmen attacked by the S√¢r√Æ are the Oƒüuz, the case for the identification of the S√¢r√Æ with the Qƒ±pƒçaqs is strengthened on geographical grounds. If the T√ºrkmen in question are Qarluqs, however, then we are not compelled to view the S√¢r√Æ as Qƒ±pƒçaqs.\\"Golden Peter B.\\"The Shaping of the Cuman-Q√Øpchaqs\\" in Il Codice Cumano e il Suo Mondo, ed.

Golden, Studies on the Peoples and Cultures of the Eurasian Steppes (Bucharest-Braila, 2011), pp. 303‚Äì332. \\"Thus, Marwaz√Æ, as we have seen, mentions a 'group of Sh√¢r√Æ' led by a chief called 'B√¢sm.l.' These may have been Yellow Uyghurs (Sar√Ø Uyghur/Shera Yoghur) who resisted Islam and have remained non-Muslims (Buddhists) to the present day. The Basm√Øl had been part of the Toquz Oghuz/Uyghur confederation.\\" or whether they simply represent the western mass of largely Kipchak-Turkic speaking tribes. A \\"victim\\" of the Cuman migration to the west was the Kimek Khanate (743‚Äì1220), which dissolved but then regrouped under Kipchak-Cuman leadership. Due to this, Kimek tribal elements were represented amongst the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks. Potapov writes that: Conquests The Cumans entered the grasslands of the present-day southern Russian steppe in the 11th century AD and went on to assault the Byzantine Empire, the Kingdom of Hungary, the Principality of Pereyaslavl and Kievan Rus'. The Cumans' entry into the area pressed the Oghuz Turks to shift west, which in turn caused the Pechenegs to move to the west of the Dnieper River. Cuman and Rus' attacks contributed to the departure of the Oghuz from the steppes north of the Black Sea. Mahmud al-Kashgari, writing in 1076, says that in the east Cuman territory bordered a town near Talas. The Cumans first entered the Bugeac (Bessarabia) at some point around 1068‚Äì1078. They launched a joint expedition with the Pechenegs against Adrianople in 1078. During that same year the Cumans were also fighting the Rus'. The Russian Primary Chronicle mentions Yemek Cumans who were active in the region of Volga Bulgaria. Political organization The vast territory of the Cuman‚ÄìKipchak realm consisted of loosely connected tribal units that represented a dominant military force but were never politically united by a strong central power; the khans acted on their own initiative. The Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks never established a state, instead forming a Cuman‚ÄìKipchak confederation (Cumania/Desht-i Qipchaq/Zemlja Poloveckaja (Polovcian Land)/Pole Poloveckoe (Polovcian Plain)), which stretched from the Danube in the west to Taraz, Kazakhstan in the east. This was possibly due to their facing no prolonged threat before the Mongol invasion, and it may have either prolonged their existence or quickened their destruction. Robert Wolff states that it was discipline and cohesion that permitted the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks to conquer such a vast territory. Al-Idrƒ´sƒ´ states that Cumania got its name from the city of Cumania; he wrote, \\"From the city of Khazaria to the city of Kirait is 25 miles. From there to Cumanie, which has given its name to the Cumans, it is 25 miles; this city is called Black Cumania. From the city of Black Cumania to the city of Tmutorakan (MaTlUqa), which is called White Cumania, it is 50 miles. White Cumania is a large inhabited city ... Indeed, in this fifth part of the seventh section there is the northern part of the land of Russia and the northern part of the land of Cumania ... In this sixth part there is a description of the land of Inner Cumania and parts of the land of Bulgaria.\\" According to the 12th-century Jewish traveler Petachiah of Regensburg \\"they have no king, only princes and royal families\\". Cumans interacted with the Rus' principalities, Bulgaria, the Byzantine Empire, and the Wallachian states in the Balkans; with Armenia and the Kingdom of Georgia (see Kipchaks in Georgia) in the Caucasus; and with the Khwarezm Empire in Central Asia. The Cumans-Kipchaks constituted an important element and were closely associated with the Khwarazmian royal house via marital alliances. The Cumans were also active in commerce with traders from Central Asia to Venice.Columbia Encyclopedia The Cumans had a commercial interest in Crimea, where they also took tribute from Crimean cities. A major area of commerce was the ancient city of Sudak, which Ibn al-Air viewed as the \\"city of the Qifjaq from which (flow) their material possessions. It is on the Khazar Sea. Ships come to it bearing clothes. The Qifjiqs buy from them and sell them slaves. Burtas furs, beaver, squirrels...\\" Due to their political dominance, the Cuman language became the lingua franca of the region. Thus the language was adopted by the Karaite Jewish and Crimean Armenian communities (who produced many documents written in Kipchak with the Armenian alphabet), where it was preserved for centuries up to the modern day. = Battles in Kievan Rus' and the Balkans = The field of Igor Svyatoslavich's battle with the Cuman- Kipchaks, by Viktor Vasnetsov The Cumans first encountered the Rus' in 1055, when they advanced towards the Rus' Pereyaslavl principality, but Prince Vsevolod I of Kiev reached an agreement with them thus avoiding a military confrontation. In 1061, however, the Cumans, under the chieftain Sokal, invaded and devastated the Pereyaslavl principality; this began a war that would go on for 175 years. In 1068 at the Battle of the Alta River, the Cumans defeated the armies of the three sons of Yaroslav the Wise, Sviatoslav II of Kiev, and Vsevolod Yaroslavych. After the Cuman victory, they repeatedly invaded Kievan Rus', devastating the land and taking captives, who became either slaves or were sold at markets in the south. The most vulnerable regions were the Principality of Pereyaslavl, the Principality of Novgorod- Seversk and the Principality of Chernigov. The Cumans initially managed to defeat the Great Prince Vladimir Monomakh of Kievan Rus' in 1093 at the Battle of the Stugna River, but they were defeated later by the combined forces of Rus principalities led by Monomakh and were forced out of the Rus' borders to the Caucasus. In these battles some Pecheneg and Oghuz groups were liberated from the Cumans and incorporated into the Rus' border-guard system. Khan Boniak launched invasions on Kiev in 1096, 1097, 1105, and 1107. In 1096, Boniak attacked Kiev and burned down the princely palace in Berestove; he also plundered the Kievan Cave Monastery. Boniak was defeated near Lubny in 1107 by the forces of the Kievan Rus' princes. The Cumans led by Boniak crushed the Hungarian army led by Coloman in 1099 and seized the royal treasury. In 1109, Monomakh launched another raid against the Cumans and captured \\"1000 tents\\". In 1111, 1113, and 1116, further raids were launched against the Cumans and resulted in the liberation and incorporation of more Pecheneg and Oghuz tribes. During this time, the Cumans raided the Byzantine Empire and Volga Bulgaria. Volga Bulgaria was attacked again at a later stage, by Khan Ayepa, father-in-law of prince Yuri Dolgorukiy, perhaps at the instigation of the prince. The Volga Bulgars in turn poisoned Ayepa \\"and the other princes; all of them died.\\" In 1089, Ladislaus I of Hungary defeated the Cumans after they attacked the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1091, the Pechenegs, a semi-nomadic Turkic people of the prairies of southwestern Eurasia, were decisively defeated as an independent force at the Battle of Levounion by the combined forces of a Byzantine army under Emperor Alexios I Komnenos and a Cuman army under Togortok/Tugorkan and Boniak. Attacked again in 1094 by the Cumans, many Pechenegs were again slain. Some of the Pechenegs fled to Hungary, as the Cumans themselves would do a few decades later. In 1091/1092 the Cumans, under Kopulch, raided Transylvania and Hungary, moving to Bihor and getting as far as the Tisza and Timi»ô rivers. Loaded with goods and prisoners they then split into three groups, after which they were attacked and defeated by King Ladislaus I. Pecheneg and Cuman raids into Hungary in the 11th century In 1092, the Cumans resumed their raids against the Rus' and also attacked the Kingdom of Poland. In 1094/1095 the Cumans, led by Tugorkan, in support of the exiled Byzantine pretender Constantine Diogenes (as a pretext to plundering), invaded the Balkans and conquered the Byzantine province of Paristrion. The Cumans then advanced all the way to Adrianople and Anchialos but couldn't conquer them. In the following years, when knights of the First Crusade were passing through the empire, Byzantium offered the Cumans prestige titles and gifts in order to appease them; subsequently good relations ensued. In 1097/1099, Sviatopolk II of Kiev requested help from the Cumans against Coloman, King of Hungary, who was involved in a feud with Volodar of Peremyshl, prince of Przemy≈õl. King Coloman and his army crossed the Carpathian Mountain and laid siege on Przemy≈õl, which prompted David Igorevich, an ally of Volodar Rostislavich, to convince the Cumans, under Khan Boniak and Altunopa, to attack the Hungarians. The Hungarian army was soundly crushed by the Cumans; the Illuminated Chronicle mentions that \\"rarely did Hungarians suffer such slaughter as in this battle.\\"The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 145.104), p. 132. In 1104 the Cumans were allied with Prince Volodar. In 1106, the Cumans advanced into the Principality of Volhynia, but were repelled by Sviatopolk II. In 1114, the Cumans launched an invasion, from the western Romanian Plain, into the Byzantine Balkans once more. This was followed up by another incursion in 1123/1124. In 1135, the Cumans again invaded the Kingdom of Poland. During the second and third crusades, in 1147 and 1189, crusaders were attacked by Cumans, who were allied to the Asen dynasty of the Second Bulgarian Empire, or who were in Byzantine service. Cumans at that time also resettled in the Kingdom of Georgia and were Christianized. There they achieved prominent positions, helped Georgians to stop the advance of Seljuk Turks, and helped make Georgia the most powerful kingdom of the region (they were referred to as naqivchaqari). After the death of the warlike Monomakh in 1125, Cumans returned to the steppe along the Rus' borders. Fighting resumed in 1128; Rus' sources mention that Sevinch, son of Khan Boniak, expressed the desire to plant his sword \\"in the Golden gate of Kiev\\", as his father had done before him. Ivan Bilibin's illustration to The Tale of Igor's Campaign shows the Cumans fighting against the Rus'. On 20 March 1155, Prince Gleb Yuryevich took Kiev with the help of a Cuman army under the Cuman prince Chemgura. By 1160 Cuman raids into Rus' had become an annual event. These attacks put pressure on Rus' and affected trade routes to the Black Sea and Constantinople, in turn leading Rus' to again attempt action. Offenses were halted during 1166‚Äì1169, when Grand prince Andrey Bogolyubsky, son of Khan Ayepa's daughter, took control of Kiev in 1169 and installed Gleb as his puppet. Gleb brought in \\"Wild\\" Cumans as well as Oghuz and Berendei units. Later, the princes of the Principality of Chernigov attempted to use Khan Konchek's army against Kievan Rus' and Suzdal. This Chernigov-Cuman alliance suffered a disastrous defeat in 1180; Elrut, Konchek's brother died in battle. In 1177, a Cuman army that was allied with Ryazan sacked six cities that belonged to the Berendei and Torkil. In 1183, the Rus' defeated a large Cuman army and captured Khan Kobiak (Kobek) as well as his sons and other notables. Subsequently, Khan Konchek concluded negotiations. Like his son Khan K√∂ten, preceding the Mongol invasion, Khan Konchek was successful in creating a more cohesive force out of the many Cuman groups ‚Äì he united the western and eastern Cuman‚ÄìKipchak tribes. Khan Konchek also changed the old Cuman system of government whereby rulership went to the most senior tribal leader; he instead passed it on to his son Koten. Igor Svyatoslavich, prince of the Principality of Novgorod-Seversk, attacked the Cumans in the vicinity of the Kayala river in 1185 but was defeated; this battle was immortalized in the Rus' epic poem The Tale of Igor's Campaign, and Alexander Borodin's opera, Prince Igor. The dynamic pattern of attacks and counterattacks between the Rus' and the Cumans indicates that both rarely, if ever, were able to attain the unity needed to deal a fatal blow. The Cuman attacks on the Rus' often had Caucasian and Danubian European implications. In the Balkans, the Cumans were in contact with all the statal entities. They fought with the Kingdom of Hungary, allied with the Bulgarians of the Second Bulgarian Empire (they were the empire's most effective military component) and with the Vlachs against the Byzantine Empire. A variant of the oldest Turkic chronicle, Oghuzname (The Oghuz Khan's Tale), mentions the Cumans fighting the Magyars, Rus', Romanians (Ulak), and Bashkirs, who had refused to submit to their authority. Central, Southern and Eastern Europe, 1190 In alliance with the Bulgarians and Vlachs,The meaning of \\"Vlach\\" in this case was the subject of fierce dispute in the late 19th and 20th centuries (see also Kaloyan of Bulgaria).As mentioned in the Robert de Clari Chronicle. the Cumans are believed to have played a significant role in the uprising led by brothers Asen and Peter of Tarnovo, resulting in victory over Byzantium and the restoration of Bulgaria's independence in 1185.In his History of the Byzantine Empire (, 1935), Russian historian A. A. Vasiliev concluded in this matter, \\"The liberating movement of the second half of the 12th century in the Balkans was originated and vigorously prosecuted by the Wallachians, ancestors of the Romanians of today; it was joined by the Bulgarians, and to some extent by the Cumans from beyond the Danube.\\" Istvan Vassary states that without the active participation of the Cumans, the Vlakho-Bulgarian rebels could never have gained the upper hand over the Byzantines, and ultimately without the military support of the Cumans, the process of Bulgarian restoration could never have been realised. The Cuman participation in the creation of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1185 and thereafter brought about basic changes in the political and ethnic sphere of Bulgaria and the Balkans. The Cumans were allies in the Bulgarian‚ÄìLatin Wars with emperor Kaloyan of Bulgaria. In 1205, at the Battle of Adrianople (1205), 14,000 Cuman light cavalry contributed to Kaloyan's crushing victory over the Latin Crusaders. Cuman troops continued to be hired throughout the 13th and 14th century by both the Bulgarians and Byzantines. The Cumans who remained east and south of the Carpathian Mountains established a county named Cumania, which was a strong military base in an area consisting of parts of Moldavia and Wallachia. The Hungarian kings claimed supremacy over Cumania ‚Äì among the nine titles of the Hungarian kings of the √Årp√°d and Anjou dynasties were rex Cumaniae ‚Äì but few, if any, Cuman leaders recognized their overlordship, pointing to the fact that rex Cumaniae was an allegory title since the kings never fulfilled that role. = Mongol invasions = Cuman statue, 12th century, Luhansk Eurasia before the Mongol invasions The conquests of Genghis Khan Like most other peoples of medieval Eastern Europe, the Cumans put up a resistance against the relentlessly advancing Mongols led by Jebe and Subutai. The Mongols crossed the Caucasus mountains in pursuit of Muhammad II, the shah of the Khwarezmid Empire, and met and defeated the Cumans in Subcaucasia in 1220. The Cuman khans Danylo Kobiakovych and Yurii Konchakovych died in battle, while the other Cumans, commanded by Khan K√∂ten, managed to get aid from the Rus' princes. As the Mongols were approaching Russia, Khan K√∂ten fled to the court of his son-in- law, Prince Mstislav the Bold of Galich, where he gave \\"numerous presents: horses, camels, buffaloes and girls. And he presented these gifts to them, and said the following, 'Today the Mongols took away our land and tomorrow they will come and take away yours'.\\" The Cumans were ignored for almost a year, however, as the Rus' had suffered from their raids for decades. But when news reached Kiev that the Mongols were marching along the Dniester River, the Rus' responded. Mstislav of Galich then arranged a council of war in Kiev, which was attended by Mstislav Romanovich, Prince Yuri II of Vladimir-Suzdal and Mstislav Svyatoslavich of Chernigov. The princes promised support to Khan Koten's Cumans and an alliance between the Rus' and Cumans was formed. It was decided that the Rus' and Cumans would move east to seek and destroy any Mongols they found. The Rus' princes then began mustering their armies and moved towards the rendezvous point. The army of the alliance of the Rus' and Cumans numbered around 80,000. When the alliance reached Pereyaslavl, they were met by a Mongol envoy that tried to persuade them not to fight. This as well as a second attempt by the Mongols failed; the alliance then crossed the Dnieper River and marched eastward for nine days pursuing a small Mongol contingent, unknowingly being led by a false retreat. The battle took place near the Kalka River in 1223. Due to confusion and mistakes, the Rus' and Cumans were defeated. In the chaos the Cumans managed to retreat, but the Rus' failed to regroup and were crushed. The Cumans were allied at Kalka River with Wallach warriors named Brodnics, led by Ploscanea. Brodnics' territory was in the lower parts of the Prut river in modern Romania and Moldova. During the second Mongol invasion of Eastern Europe in 1237‚Äì1240 the Cumans were defeated again; at this time groups of Cumans went to live with the Volga Bulgars, who had not been attacked yet. Istvan Vassary states that after the Mongol conquest, \\"A large-scale westward migration of the Cumans began.\\" Certain Cumans also moved to Anatolia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. In the summer of 1237 the first wave of this Cuman exodus appeared in Bulgaria. The Cumans crossed the Danube, and this time Tsar Ivan Asen II could not tame them, as he had often been able to do earlier; the only possibility left for him was to let them march through Bulgaria in a southerly direction. They proceeded through Thrace as far as Hadrianoupolis and Didymotoichon, plundering and pillaging the towns and the countryside, just as before. The whole of Thrace became, as Akropolites put it, a \\"Scythian desert.\\" A direct attack on Cumania came only in 1238‚Äì1239, and encountered serious resistance by various Cuman khans. The final blow came in 1241, when Cuman control over the Pontic steppes ended and the Cuman‚ÄìKipchak confederation ceased to exist as a political entity, with the remaining Cuman tribes being dispersed, either becoming subjects and mixing with their Mongol conquerors, as part of what was to be known as the Golden Horde (Kipchak Khanate) and Nogai Horde, or fleeing to the west, to the Byzantine Empire, the Second Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary, where they integrated into the elite and became kings and nobles with many privileges. Other Cuman captives were sold as slaves, who would go on to become Mamluks in Egypt, who would attain the rank of Sultan or hold regional power as emirs or beys. Some of these Mamluks led by Sultan Baibars would fight the Mongols again, defeating them at the Battle of Ain Jalut and the Battle of Elbistan. A group of Cumans under two leaders named Jonas and Saronius, the former of whom was higher in rank, entered the Latin Empire of Constantinople as allies about 1240, probably fleeing the Mongols. The name Saronius (found in Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, who calls the leaders kings) is probably a corruption of the Cuman name S√Øƒçgan, meaning \\"mouse\\". They assisted the Emperor Baldwin II in the capture of Tzurullon from the Nicaeans in that year. The following year the Christian daughters of Saronius married two of the leading noblemen of the empire, Baldwin of Hainaut and William of Meri, while Jonas's daughter married Narjot III de Toucy, who had once served as regent of the empire in Baldwin's absence. When Narjot died in 1241, his wife became a nun. Jonas died that same year and was buried in a tumulus outside Constantinople in a pagan ceremony. According to Aubrey, eight volunteer warriors and twenty-six horses were sacrificed at the funeral. = Settlement on the Hungarian plain = Cumans arriving to Hungary. Kingdom of Hungary, 13th century King Ladislaus IV of Hungary. Ladislaus' mother, Elizabeth the Cuman, was the daughter of a Cuman chief. Ladislaus in K√∂r√∂sszeg (Cheresig, Romania) on 10 July 1290 King Andrew II of Hungary granted the Burzenland region to the Teutonic Knights in 1211, with the purpose of ensuring security of the southeastern borders of his kingdom against the Cumans. The Teutonic Knights campaigned against the Cumans, on behalf of King Andrew, during the years of 1221‚Äì1225. However, the Teutonic Knights failed to defeat the Cumans and began to establish a country independent of the King of Hungary. In 1238, after Mongol attacks on Cumania, King B√©la IV of Hungary offered refuge to the remainder of the Cuman people under their leader Khan K√∂ten, who in turn vowed to convert his 40,000 families to Christianity. King B√©la hoped to use the new subjects as auxiliary troops against the Mongols, who were already threatening Hungary. The Cumans were joined by the Iranian Jasz people, who had been living with the Cumans. Batu Khan of the Mongols then ordered Bela to stop giving refuge to the Cumans and made a particular point that if attacked the Cumans could easily run away, for they were skilled horseman, but not so for the Hungarians, who were a sedentary nation and had no such luxury. Bela rejected this ultimatum. Around December 1240, news came that the Mongols were advancing towards Hungary. King Bela then installed front line defenses at the Carpathian Mountains, after which he returned to Buda and called a council of war and ordered unity against the Mongols. The opposite happened, however, as many of the barons were hostile towards the Cumans. The Hungarian barons noted that there were Cumans in the Mongol armies, but they didn't realize that this was because they were conscripted into it and had no say in the matter. In particular the barons didn't trust K√∂ten, despite the fact that the Mongols had attacked his people for nearly 20 years. This chaos pushed Bela into a corner; feeling he needed to show his strength and keep the rebellious barons on his side, he ordered K√∂ten to be placed under house arrest. This did not placate the barons and had an opposite effect of erroneously seeming to admit that the King harboured doubts about K√∂ten, too. This angered the Cumans, who were far from happy about the actions taken against them, and who had done nothing to invite such actions and hated the Mongols. News arrived on 10 March that the Mongols had attacked the Hungarian defenses at the Carpathian passes. This prompted Bela to send a letter to Duke Frederick of Austria asking for help. Frederick had previously wanted Bela's throne, but Bela responded by amassing a vast army and marching to the gates of Vienna, which forced Frederick to step back. On 14 March, news had arrived that the Carpathian defense forces were defeated by the Mongols. Ironically, given the suspicion of the Cumans, they were the only ones who seemed willing to fight the Mongols, the memory of the fate that had befallen them on the steppes still being fresh in their minds. By this time Bela had lost control of his army and many towns were destroyed. Soon thereafter Frederick arrived, and, wishing to harm the country's defense (in revenge to Bela), he stirred up further feelings against the Cumans. After crushing defeats and facing complete collapse, the Hungarians engaged in a suicidal betrayal of the Cumans, the people that had done the most in repelling the Mongols. Some of the barons went to K√∂ten's house with the intent of killing him as scapegoat or handing him over to the Mongols, possibly believing the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks were Mongol spies. However, the barons had K√∂ten assassinated in Pest on 17 March 1241.The murder of K√∂ten is described in the novel Batu by Vasily Yan, in the chapter \\"The End of Khan Kotyan\\". When news of this outrage reached the Cuman camp there was an eruption of \\"Vesuvian intensity\\". In revenge for this victimization they slaughtered a vast number of Hungarians. The Cumans then left for the Balkans and the Second Bulgarian Empire, going on a rampage of destruction through Hungary \\"equal to that which Europe had not experienced since the incursions of the Mongols\\".Roger Finch, Christianity among the Cumans , p. 5. With this departure of its only ally and most efficient and reliable military force, Hungary was now further weakened to attack, and a month later it was destroyed by the Mongols. After the invasion, King B√©la IV, now penniless and humiliated after the confiscation of his treasury and loss of three of his border areas, begged the Cumans to return to Hungary and help rebuild the country. In return for their military service, B√©la invited the Cumans to settle in areas of the Great Plain between the Danube and the Tisza rivers; this region had become almost uninhabited after the Mongol raids of 1241‚Äì1242.Horvath 2001 The Cuman tribes subsequently settled throughout the Great Hungarian Plain, creating two regions incorporating the name Cumania (Kuns√°g in Hungarian): Greater Cumania (Nagykuns√°g) and Little Cumania (Kiskuns√°g). Six of these tribes were the Borchol (Borscol), who settled in county of Temes (the Borchol clan was also active around Rus'; they were also a tribe of the Golden Horde mentioned as Burcoylu); Csertan, who settled in Little Cumania; Olas, who settled in Greater Cumania; Iloncsuk, who settled in Little Cumania; Kor, who settled in the county of Csanad and the sixth being, possibly, Koncsog. Historical coat of arms of Kuns√°g, where Cumans in Hungary settled, divided into Little Cumania and Greater Cumania As the Cumans came into the kingdom, the Hungarian nobility suspected that the king intended to use the Cumans to strengthen his royal power at their expense. During the following centuries, the Cumans in Hungary were granted rights and privileges, the extent of which depended on the prevailing political situation. Some of these rights survived until the end of the 19th century, although the Cumans had long since assimilated with Hungarians. The Cumans were different in every way to the local population of Hungary ‚Äì their appearance, attire, and hairstyle set them apart. In 1270, Elizabeth the Cuman, the daughter of a Cuman chieftain Seyhan,[(Hungarian) Krist√≥, Gyula; Makk, Ferenc (1996). Az √Årp√°d-h√°z uralkod√≥i [Rulers of the House of √Årp√°d]. I.P.C. K√∂nyvek. ], p. 268. became queen of Hungary. Elizabeth ruled during the minority of her son (future king Ladislaus IV of Hungary) in the years of 1272‚Äì1277. A struggle took place between her and the noble opposition, which led to her imprisonment by the rebels; but supporters freed her in 1274. During her reign, gifts of precious clothes, land, and other objects were given to the Cumans with the intent to ensure their continued support, and in particular during the civil war between King B√©la IV and Stephen V of Hungary, when both sides tried to gain Cuman support. During this conflict, in 1264, B√©la sent Cuman troops commanded by the chieftain Menk to fight his son Stephen. Elizabeth married Stephen V; they were parents of six children. Their son, Ladislaus IV became the king of Hungary while her other son, Andrew of Hungary, became Duke of Slavonia. By 1262, Stephen V had taken the title of 'Dominus Cumanorum' and became the Cumans' highest judge. After his enthronement, the Cumans came directly under the power of the king of Hungary and the title of 'Dominus Cumanorum' (judge of the Cumans) had passed to the count palatine, who was the highest official after the king. The Cumans had their own representatives and were exempt from the jurisdiction of county officials. By the 15th century, the Cumans were permanently settled in Hungary, in villages whose structure corresponded to that of the local population, and they were Christianized. The Cumans did not always ally with the Hungarian kings ‚Äì they assassinated Ladislaus IV; however, other sources suggest that certain Hungarian barons had a role in his murder, thus Ladislaus fell victim to his political enemies. The royal and ecclesiastical authorities incorporated, rather than excluded, the Cumans. The Cumans served as light cavalry in the royal army, an obligation since they were granted asylum. Being fierce and capable warriors (as noted by Istvan Vassary), they had an important role in the royal army. The king led them in numerous expeditions against neighbouring countries; most notably they played an important part in the battle between Rudolf of Habsburg and Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1278 ‚Äì King Ladislaus IV and the Cumans (which numbered 16,000) were on Rudolf's side. Steppe nomads fighting the Hungarians, Chronicon Pictum, 14th century Hungarian kings relied on the Cumans to counterbalance the growing independent power of the nobility. Royal policy towards the Cumans was determined by their military and political importance. The Hungarian kings continuously hoped to use Cuman military support, the main reason for the invitation to settle and continued royal favors to them. The kings' main aim was to secure Cuman loyalty by various means, including intermarriage between the Cumans and the Hungarian royal family. Ladislaus IV \\"the Cuman\\" (whose mother was Queen Elizabeth the Cuman) was particularly fond of the Cumans and abandoned Hungarian culture and dress for Cuman culture, dress, and hairstyle; he lived with his Cuman entourage and concubines, who were K√ºp√ße√ß, Mandola, and Ayduva. There were clashes between the Hungarians and Cumans in 1280 and 1282. The first involved the king convincing the Cumans not to leave the country, yet a small group still moved to Wallachia. The second was a battle between Cuman rebels and the king's forces. The Cumans initially lived in felt yurts, but as time went by they gradually gave up their nomadic way of life. The head of Cuman clans served the dual role of a military leader and a judge. The Cumans, having their own jurisdiction, were exempt from Hungarian jurisdiction and appealed to the king only in cases of unsettled disagreements. The Cumans paid 3000 gold bullions a year to the king, as well as other products and animals (since King B√©la IV). They had other privileges of self jurisdiction, with their own judges, magistrates and priests and not paying port and custom dues. Cuman villages did not have landlords and thus no manors were established; this meant that the people of these villages bought off statute labour. The royal guard of the Hungarian kings were Cumans, called nyoger. From the 16th century onwards, the Cumans between the Danube and Tisza rivers were referred to as Kiskun, while the Cumans east of the Tisza river were referred to as nagykun. The majority of Cumans were exterminated during the Great Turkish War Coat of arms of Maria Theresa as \\"king\\" of Hungary, 1777On the middle shield Kingdom of Hungary, on the back shield \\"king\\" of Croatia, Dalmatia, Slavonia, Lodomeria, Galicia, Bosnia, Serbia, Cumania and Bulgaria The Cumanians' settlements were destroyed during the Turkish wars in the 16th and 17th centuries; more Cumans than Hungarians were killed.Szakaly 2000. Around 1702, Cuman and Jasz privileges were lost. The court sold all three districts to the Teutonic Knights, though the lordship of these three regions was returned to Hungary. In 1734, Karcag became a market town, due to the permission to organise fairs. During this time, it had bought off its borders as its own property for 43,200 Rhenish florins. On May 6, 1745, due to the cooperation between the Cumans and Jasz people, as well as their material strength of their communities, they were able to officially buy off their freedom by paying off more than 500,000 Rhenish florins and by arming and sending to camp 1000 cavalry. At the beginning of the 18th century the Cumanian territories were resettled by Hungarian-speaking descendants of the Cumans.Meszaros 2000. In the middle of the 18th century they got their status by becoming free farmers and no longer serfs.Lango 2000a. Here, the Cumans maintained their autonomy, language, and some ethnic customs well into the modern era. According to P√°l√≥czi's estimation, originally 70‚Äì80,000 Cumans settled in Hungary. Other estimations are 180‚Äì200,000. = Cuman involvement in Serbia = Cuman involvement in Serbia first occurred as a result of marital ties between Serbia and Hungary. King Stephen V of Hungary gave his daughter, Catherine (whose mother was Queen Elizabeth the Cuman, daughter of the Cuman chieftain Seyhan) in marriage to Stefan Dragutin, son of King Stefan Uro≈° I of Serbia. King Uro≈° had promised both his son and King Stephen that he would make Dragutin king during his own lifetime; but he later declined this. Dragutin, in disappointment, requested aid from King Stephen, who said he would lend his Hungarian and Cuman troops. Subsequently, Dragutin set out with his troops and marched on his father. King Uro≈° had declined once more, and in 1276 Dragutin clashed with his father's army in Gacko, winning the battle. Afterwards, Dragutin took the throne and became king of Serbia. After King Stephen's death, his son, Ladislaus IV the Cuman, continued to support Dragutin, his brother-in-law. From 1270 onwards Cuman mercenaries and auxiliaries were present on both sides of the warring factions, sometimes ignoring the orders of the party they were fighting for, instead acting on their own and looting the countryside. The Cumans had also burned down ≈Ωiƒça, the former see of the archbishopric of the Serbian Church. By 1272, the region of Braniƒçevo in Serbia had become a Hungarian banate, but soon afterwards, its rulers, Kudelin and Darman succeeded in making it an independent state. Kudelin and Darman were either Cuman warriors in Bulgarian service or Bulgarian nobles of Cuman origin. This move to independence had angered Ladislaus IV as well as Dragutin, who wanted to crush the rebellion. Darman and Kudelin were supported by the Tatars of the Golden Horde (Kipchak Khanate) against the Hungarians and Serbs. Subsequently, Dragutin attacked the brothers but failed to defeat them. After this attack the brothers hired Cuman and Tatar mercenaries. Dragutin in turn went to his brother, King Milutin for help. Dragutin battled the brothers again, this time with King Milutin's help as well as support from King Ladislaus IV (Cuman troops), and defeated them. After this King Ladislaus continued negotiations with Darman and Kudelin, but this had failed so he sent Transylvanian and Cuman troops against them. The Cumans had fought on both the Bulgarian and Hungarian-Serbian sides. The Cumans were also involved with the semi-independent Bulgarian Tsardom of Vidin between 1290‚Äì1300, which had become a target of Serbian expansion. In 1280 the Cuman noble, Shishman, became ruler of Vidin. He was perhaps granted the position of despot of Vidin soon after the accession of another Bulgarian noble of Cuman origin, Tsar George Terter I (r. 1280‚Äì1292), to the Bulgarian throne in 1280. Shishman was either a close relative or a brother of George Terter I.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, –ô–æ—Ä–¥–∞–Ω; –õ–∞–∑–∞—Ä–æ–≤, –ò–≤–∞–Ω; –ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤, –ü–ª–∞–º–µ–Ω (1999). –ö–æ–π –∫–æ–π –µ –≤ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ–≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∞ –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è [Who is Who in Medieval Bulgaria] (in Bulgarian). –ü–µ—Ç—ä—Ä –ë–µ—Ä–æ–Ω. . Shishman may have established his authority over the Vidin region as early as the 1270s, after the death of the previous ruler of that area, Jacob Svetoslav. Danilo, a Serbian archbishop, reported, \\"At that time in the land of the Bulgars a prince called Shishman emerged. He lived in the town of Vidin, and obtained the adjacent countries and much of the Bulgarian land.\\" Some years after, Shishman invaded Serbia and got as far as Hvostno. After failing to capture Zdrelo he returned to Vidin. King Milutin then attacked and devastated Vidin. Subsequent to this Milutin replaced him on his throne on the basis that he would become Shishman's ally. The alliance was strengthened by Shishman marrying the daughter of the Serbian grand zupan Dragos. Further security came about when Milutin later gave his daughter Anna as a wife to Shishman's son Michael, who in 1323 became Tsar of Bulgaria. = Golden Horde and Byzantine mercenaries = The division of the Mongol Empire, c. 1300, with the Golden Horde in yellow The Cumans who remained scattered in the prairie of what is now southwest Russia joined the Mongol Golden Horde Khanate, and their descendants became assimilated with local populations including the Mongols (Tatars). The cultural heritage of those Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks who remained was transferred to the Mongols, whose √©lite adopted many of the traits, customs, and language of the Cumans and Kipchaks; the Cumans, Kipchaks, and Mongols finally became assimilated through intermarriage and became the Golden Horde. Those Cumans, with the Turko-Mongols, adopted Islam in the second half of the 13th and the first half of the 14th century. In 1071, Cumans participated in the Battle of Manzikert as mercenaries in the Byzantine army against the Seljuks. Emperor Romanus had sent the Cumans and Franks to secure the fortress of Ahlat on the shore of Lake Van. The Cumans, who did not receive their pay, later defected to the Seljuks. In 1086 Cumans devastated Byzantine settlements in the Balkans. Later the Cumans joined the Pechenegs and the former Hungarian king, Salomon, in plundering the Byzantine Balkan provinces. Subsequent to this, the Cumans gave aid to Tatos, the chief of Distra. In 1091 there was a disagreement in plunder shares between the Cumans and Pechenegs, which resulted in a breach between the two peoples; this contributed to the Cumans (led by Togortok/Tugorkan and Boniak, who had repeatedly raided Kievan Rus') joining Alexios I Komnenos against the Pechenegs in the Battle of Levounion. A couple of weeks afterwards the Cumans invaded the Balkans. After the Battle of Kalka River a large group of 10,000 Cumans invaded Thrace where they pillaged towns that had recently come under the control of the Nicaean Empire. This continued until 1242 when Nicaean emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes, in response to the situation, won their favour with \\"gifts and diplomacy\\". Thereafter he succeeded in settling most of them in Anatolia throughout the Meander valley and the region east of Philadelphia. Most of these Cumans enrolled in the army and soon afterwards were baptized. Vatatzes' policy towards the Cumans was distinguished by its enormous scale and relatively successful outcome. Cumans had served as mercenaries in the armies of the Byzantine Empire since the reign of Alexios I Komnenos (1081‚Äì1118) and were one of the most important elements of the Byzantine army until the mid-14th century. They served as light cavalry (horse-archers) and as standing troops; those in the central army were collectively called Skythikoi/Skythikon. Other Cumans lived a more dangerous life as highlanders on the fringes of the empire, possibly being involved in a mixture of agriculture and transhumance, acting as a buffer between Nicaean farmers and Turkic nomads. These Cumans were frequently mustered for Byzantine campaigns in Europe. In 1242 they were employed by Vatatzes in his siege of Thessaloniki. In 1256 emperor Theodore II Laskaris left a force of 300 Cumans with the Nicaean governor of Thessaloniki. In 1259, 2000 Cuman light cavalry fought for the Nicaean Empire at the Battle of Pelagonia. Cumans were again involved in 1261, where the majority of the 800 troops under Alexios Strategopoulos that retook Constantinople, were Cumans. Large Cuman contingents were also part of the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos' European campaigns of 1263‚Äì1264, 1270‚Äì1272 and 1275. Cumans were again employed by emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos in 1292, in his campaign against the Despotate of Epirus. The Cumans, together with Turk mercenaries, terminated the campaign by an unauthorized retreat. In contrast to their light cavalry counterparts, Cuman standing troops appear as a distinct group only once, albeit very significantly. During the election of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos to the regency in 1258, after the consultation of Latin mercenaries, the Cumans present at the court offered their opinion on the matter in \\"good Greek\\". This is indicative of the Cumans spending considerable time in the company of Greek speakers. The importance of this Cuman group came from its tendency to foster assimilation (Hellenization) and, through time, the social advancement of its members. An example of this influential group was Sytzigan (known as Syrgiannes after baptism), who before 1290 became Megas Domestikos (Commander-in-Chief of the Army) under Emperor Andronikos II. His son, Syrgiannes Palaiologos, attained the title of Pinkernes and was a friend of Andronikos III Palaiologos and John Kantakouzenos. An act from the archive of the Lavra of Athanasios mentions Cuman Stratioti (mercenaries from the Balkans) in the region of Almopia who received two douloparoikoi in 'pronoia' (a Byzantine form of feudalism based on government assignment of revenue-yielding property to prominent individuals in return for military service) some time before 1184. Culture Cuman camp Cuman representation in the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç Chronicle Horses were central to Cuman culture and way of life, and their main activity was animal husbandry. The knight, Robert de Clari, described the Cumans as nomadic warriors who raised horses, sheep, goats, camels, and cattle. They moved north with their herds in summer and returned south in winter. Some of the Cumans led a semi-settled life and took part in trading and farming, as well as blacksmithing, furriery, shoe making, saddle making, bow making, and clothes making. They mainly sold and exported animals, mostly horses, and animal products. They attached feeding sacks to the bridles of their horses, allowing them to cover great distances. They could go on campaign with little baggage and carry everything they needed. They wore sheepskin and were armed with composite bows and arrows. They prayed to the first animal they saw in the morning.As mentioned in Robert de Clari's chronicle.Ovidiu Pecican Troia Venetia Roma Like the Bulgars, the Cumans were known to drink blood from their horse (they would cut a vein) when they ran out of water far from an available source. Their traditional diet consisted of soup with millet and meat and included beer, curdled mare's milk, kumis, and bread (though bread could be rare depending on location). The fundamental unit of Cuman society was the family, made up of blood relatives. A group of families formed a clan, led by a chief; a group of clans formed a tribe, led by a khan. A typical Cuman clan was named after an object, animal, or a leader of the clan. The names of the leaders of clans or tribes sometimes ended in \\"apa/aba\\". Cuman names were descriptive and represented a personal trait or an idea. Clans lived together in movable settlements named 'Cuman towers' by Kievan Rus' chroniclers. The Cuman‚ÄìKipchak tribes formed sub-confederations governed by charismatic ruling houses ‚Äì they acted independently of each other and had opposing policies. The territory controlled distinguished each Cuman tribe: the \\"seashore\\" Cuman tribes lived in the steppes between the mouths of the Dnieper and the Dniester; the \\"coastal\\" tribes lived on the coast of the Sea of Azov; the \\"Dnieper\\" tribes lived on both banks of the bend in the Dnieper Valley; and the \\"Don\\" Cumans lived in the Don River Valley. D. A. Rasovskii notes five separate independent Cuman groups: the central Asiatic, the Volga-Yayik (or Ural), the Donets-Don (between the Volga and the Dnieper), the lower course of the Dnieper, and the Danube. The Rus' grouped the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks into two categories: the Non Wild Polvcians ‚Äì 'civilised' Cumans of the western part of the Cuman‚ÄìKipchak confederation who had friendly relations with Kievan Rus' ‚Äì and the Wild Polvcians ‚Äì who formed the eastern part of the confederation and who had hostile relations with Kievan Rus'. As the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks gained more territory, they drove off or dominated many tribes ‚Äì such as the Oghuz, various Iranian and Finno-Ugrian tribes, Pechenegs, and Slav groups. They also raided the Byzantine Empire and a few times joined the Normans from southern Italy and the Hungarians in doing so. Over the course of time feudalism would take over the traditional social structure of the Cumans, and this led to the changing of identity from kinship to territory-based. Some of the Cumans eventually settled and led sedentary lives involved in agriculture and crafts such as leather and iron working and weapon making. Others became merchants and traded from their towns along the ancient trade routes to regions such as the Orient, Middle East, and Italy. The Cumans also played the role of middlemen in trade between Byzantium and the East, which passed through the Cuman- controlled ports of Sudak (Surozh), Oziv, and Saksyn. Several land routes between Europe and the Near East ran through Cuman territories: the Zaloznyi, the Solianyi, and the Varangian. Cuman towns ‚Äì Sharukan, Suhrov/Sugrov, and Balin ‚Äì appeared in the Donets River Basin; they were also inhabitted by other peoples besides the Cumans. Due to the practice of Cuman towns being named after their khans, town names changed over time ‚Äì the town of Sharukan appears as Osenev, Sharuk, and Cheshuev. Rock figures called stone babas, which are found throughout southern Ukraine and other areas on the steppes of Russia, were closely connected with the Cuman religious cult of shamanism. The Cumans tolerated all religions, and Islam and Christianity spread quickly among them. As they were close to the Kievan Rus' principalities, Cuman khans and important families began to slavicize their names ‚Äì for example, Yaroslav Tomzakovych, Hlib Tyriievych, Yurii Konchakovych, and Danylo Kobiakovych. Ukrainian princely families were often connected by marriage with Cuman khans, lessening wars and conflicts. Sometimes the princes and khans waged joint campaigns; for example, in 1221 they attacked the trading town of Sudak on the Black Sea, which was held by the Seljuk Turks and which interfered with Rus'-Cuman trade. The Mamluks were warrior-slaves in the Islamic world. Many Mamluks were of Cuman origin. The Cumans were reported to be handsome people with blond hair, fair skin and blue eyes, and desirable women. Cuman women had a high reputation for their beauty amongst the Russian aristocracy. Robert de Clari reported that the Cumans often wore a sleeveless sheepskin vest, usually worn in conjunction with bracers. Underneath the vest was worn a short or long sleeved tunic/tabard, extended to the mid calf, splitting in the front and back between the legs. Men wore trousers and a kaftan, each fastened by a belt, which was the traditional costume. The women also wore caftans, as well as pants, dresses, and tunics shorter than those worn by men, sometimes split along the front, back, and sides. Clothes were commonly coloured deep crimson for decoration. Cuman men wore distinguishing conical felt or leather hats, pointed at the top with a broad brim (if made of felt) or a fur trim around the base (if made of leather). The brim of the hat formed a sharp angle at the front and upturned on the rear and at the sides. Women wore a large variety of head dresses and also wore conical hats but with a felt top and a cloth veil extending down the back. This veil only covered the back neck and not the hair or face; another source states that it did cover the hair and that sometimes one or two braids were visible. Women wore a variety of jewellery, such as torques, a type of neck ornament consisting of one or several metal strands attached to a ribbon or necklace and hung around the neck, and head dresses that were made of a series of silver rings on a solid, cylindrically shaped material that was fastened at the temples. The men shaved the top of their head, while the rest of the hair was plaited into several braids; they also had prominent moustaches. Other Cumans also wore their hair very long, without shaving the top. The women had their hair loose or braided with buns twisting at the side. Both men and women followed a tradition of braiding coloured ribbons into their hair. For footwear, Cuman men and women wore long leather or felt boots with support straps connected to their belt. Both men and women wore cloth or metal arm bands. A modern reenactment of Cumans When the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks swore oaths, it was done with swords in the hands that touched the body of a dog cut in two. The Italian Franciscan friar, traveler, and historian, John of Plano Carpini, says that when the Hungarian prince married the Cuman princess, ten Cumans swore over a dog cut in half with a sword that they would defend the Kingdom of Hungary. The Christian writer and historian of the crusades, Jean de Joinville (c. 1224‚Äìc. 1317), mentions that when the Cumans and Byzantines made an alliance, the Cumans made a dog pass between both sides and cut it with a sword, obliging the Byzantines to do the same; the Cumans said that both they and the Byzantines should be cut in pieces if they failed each other. Joinville described a Cuman noble's funeral: he was buried seated on a chair whilst his best horse and best sergeant were placed beside him alive. Prior to this the sergeant was given a large sum of money by the Cuman leaders for the purpose of handing it back to them when they too would come into the afterlife. The Cuman khan also gave a letter of recommendation to the sergeant, which was addressed to the first king of the Cumans, in which the present king testified to the sergeant's good character. After these proceedings a huge mound was raised above the tomb. Cumans were buried in their warrior outfits. Wolves were greatly respected by the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks, and they would sometimes howl along with them in commune. The personal bodyguard of the khan were called Bori (wolf in Turkic). Like other nomadic nations, the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks initiated blood bonds (with the purpose of symbolically cementing a bond) by the drinking or mixing of each other's blood. Amongst the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks ethnic names often became personal names ‚Äì this was also practiced amongst the Mongols. This practice involved naming newborns after the names of conquered tribes and people. Names such as 'Baskord' (from the Bashkirs), 'Imek' (from the Kimeks), 'Kitan' (from the Mongol Khitan people), and 'Urus' were used by the Cumans. Friar William of Rubruck, a Franciscan traveler who visited the Mongols in 1253-55, provides another account of Cuman customs. He mentions that Cumans built statues for dead notables, facing east and holding a cup (these statues are not to be confused with the balbals, which represent the enemies that were killed by him). He also notes that for richer notables, the Cumans built tombs in the form of houses. Rubruk gives an eyewitness account about a man who had recently died: the Cumans had hung up sixteen horses' hides, in groups of four, between high poles, facing the four points of the compass. The mourners then also placed kumis (a fermented mares' milk drink widely drunk in Inner Asia) for the dead man to consume. Other graves had plenty of stones statues placed around them (balbals), with four tall ones placed to face the points of the compass. Rubrick also wrote \\"Here the Cumans, who are called Chapchat [Kipchak] used to pasture their flocks, but the Germans call them Valans and their province Valania, and Isidorus calls (the region stretching) from the river Don as far as the Azov Sea and the Danube, Alania. And this land stretches from the Danube as far as the Don, the borderline of Asia and Europe; one can reach there in two months with quick riding as the Tatars ride.... and this country which extends from the Danube to the Tanais [Don] was all inhabited by the Chapcat Comans, and even further from the Don to the Volga, which rivers are at a distance of ten days' journey...And in the territory between these two rivers [i.e. the Don and the Volga] where we continued our way, the Cuman Kipchaks lived.\\"Rockhill, W. W., The journey of William of Rubruck to the eastern parts of the world, 1253‚Äì55, as narrated by himself, with two accounts of the earlier journey of John of Pian de Carpine. London: Hakluyt Society. For many years before the Mongol invasion, the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks were in ambiguous relationships with their neighbours (often through marital and martial alliances), the Kwarizmians, Byzantines, Georgians, and the Rus'; at a given time they could be at peace with one, at war with another.Golden, Peter B., \\"Cumanica IV: The Qipchaq Tribes\\", Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi, v. IX (1997), p. 107 The Byzantine Empire hesitated to go to war with the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks north of the Danube River; instead, like the Hungarians, they chose to bribe them. Since Kwarizm had more important enemies, they hired the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks for garrison duty. There were numerous ways the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks could make a living as nomadic warriors. One could partake in questing and raiding with their tribe and subsequently keep the spoils. Another avenue was to seek employment as a mercenary in exchange for the guarantee of loot. One could serve in a garrison, although this caused those Cumans to eventually forget their light cavalry skills and become poor infantry. This was fully exploited when the Mongol army destroyed the Cuman‚ÄìKipchak garrison in Samarkand. Cuman‚ÄìKipchak women fought beside their fellow male warriors. Women were shown great respect and would often ride on a horse or wagon while the men walked. In their travels, the Cumans used wagons to transport supplies as well as weapons such as mangonels and ballistas. Light felt tents with a frame consisting of wooden laths could be carried on top of wagons and easily be placed on the ground. The windows of the tents were \\"grilled\\" in such a way that it was difficult to see in but easy to see out. As the Cumans became more settled, they constructed forts for defence and settlement purposes. The Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks used dung for fires when firewood was not available. The Cumans had very strict rules (taboos) against theft, and thus would, without prohibition, loosen their horses, camels, and livestock (sheep, oxen) without shepherds or guards when they were stationary. The law of blood vengeance was common among the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks. The Cuman calendar was atypical, as it showed neither specific Christian influences nor any trace of the Chinese‚ÄìTurkic twelve-year animal cycle; it appeared to be an archaic system. = Military tactics = Battle between the Cumans and Grand Duke Andrei Bogolyubsky Up until the late 11th and early 12th centuries, the Cumans fought mainly as light cavalry, later developing heavy cavalry. The main weapons of the Cumans were the recurved and, later, the composite bow (worn on the hip with the quiver), and the javelin, curved sword (a sabre less curved than a scimitar), mace, and heavy spear for lancing. Due to European influence, some of the later period Cumans wielded war hammers and axes. For defense they used a round or almond shaped shield, short sleeved mail armour, consisting of commonly alternating solid and riveted rows, lamelar (iron or leather), leather cuirass, shoulder spaulders, conical or dome shaped iron helmet with a detachable iron or bronze anthropomorphic face plate (gold for princes and khans), and at times a camail suspended from the helmet, consisting of chain or leather. The armour was strengthened by leather or felt disks that were attached to the chest and back. The items suspended from the belts were a bow case with bow, a quiver, a knife and a comb. They also wore elaborate masks in battle, shaped like and worn over the face. The Cuman Mamluks in Egypt were, in general, more heavily armed than Mongol warriors, sometimes having body armour and carrying a bow and arrow, axe, club, sword, dagger, mace, shield, and a lance. The Cuman Mamluks rode on larger Arabian horses in comparison to steppe ones. The commonly employed Cuman battle tactic was repeated attacks by light cavalry archers, facing and shooting to the rear of the horse, then a feigned retreat and skilled ambush. To maintain this tactic to optimum efficiency, the Cumans kept a large number of reserve horses (10‚Äì12 remounts) to replace fatigued ones, so that a fresh horse was available at all times. The horsemen used oval shaped stirrups and employed a large bridle for their horses. Another important accessory was a small whip attached to the rider's wrist. Tribal banners were either made of cloth with tribal emblems or dyed horse hair ‚Äì with more tails signifying greater importance of the warrior or group. Some of the Cumans who moved west were influenced by Western heraldry, and they eventually displayed hybridized European-Cuman heraldry. Niketas Choniates, while describing a Battle of Beroia in the late 12th century, gave an interesting description of the nomadic battle techniques of the Cumans: > They [The Cumans] fought in their habitual manner, learnt from their > fathers. They would attack, shoot their arrows and begin to fight with > spears. Before long they would turn their attack into flight and induce > their enemy to pursue them. Then they would show their faces instead of > their backs, like birds cutting through the air, and would fight face to > face with their assailants and struggle even more bravely. This they would > do several times, and when they gained the upper hand over the Romans > [Byzantines], they would stop turning back again. Then they would draw their > swords, release an appalling roar, and fall upon the Romans quicker than a > thought. They would seize and massacre those who fought bravely and those > who behaved cowardly alike.\\" Robert de Clari gave another description: > Each one has at least ten or twelve horses, and they have them so well- > trained that they follow them wherever they want to take them, and they > mount first on one and then on another. When they are on a raid, each horse > has a bag hung on his nose, in which his fodder is put, and he feeds as he > follows his master, and they do not stop going by night or by day. And they > ride so hard that they cover in one day and one night fully six days' > journey or seven or eight. And while they are on the way they will not seize > anything or carry it along, before their return, but when they are > returning, then they seize plunder and make captives and take anything they > can get. Nor do they go armed, except that they wear a garment of sheepskin > and carry bows and arrows.  Religion  The Cuman people practiced Shamanism as well as Tengrism. Their belief system had animistic and shamanistic elements; they celebrated their ancestors and provided the dead with objects whose lavishness was considered an indicator to the recipient's social rank. The Cumans referred to their shamans as Kam (female: kam katun); their activities were referred to as qamlyqet, meaning \\"to prophesy\\". The Cumans used Iranian words to designate certain concepts: uchuchmak (identical in Turkic) meaning \\"fly away, paradise\\" and keshene meaning \\"nest\\" (the concept was that the soul has the form of a bird). Funerals for important members involved firstly creating a mound, then placing the dead inside, along with various items deemed useful in the afterlife, a horse (like the Bulgars), and sometimes a servant or slave. Cuman divination practices used animals, especially the wolf and dog. The dog \\"It/Kopec\\" was sacred to the Cuman‚ÄìKipchaks, to the extent that an individual, tribe, or clan would be named after the dog or type of dog. Cumans had shamans who communicated with the spirit world; they were consulted for questions of outcomes. The Cumans in Christian territories were baptised in 1227 by Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom, in a mass baptism in Moldavia on the orders of Bortz Khan,Szilvia Kov√°cs Bortz, a Cuman Chief in the 13th Century Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae Vol. 58, No. 3, Proceedings of the First International Conference on the Mediaeval History of the Eurasian Steppe: Szeged, Hungary May 11‚Äî16, 2004: Part III (2005), pp. 255-266 who swore allegiance to King Andrew II of Hungary. Codex Cumanicus The Codex Cumanicus, which was written by Italian merchants and German missionaries between 1294 and 1356, was a linguistic manual for the Turkic Cuman language of the Middle Ages, designed to help Catholic missionaries communicate with the Cumans. It consisted of a Latin‚ÄìPersian‚ÄìCuman glossary, grammar observations, lists of consumer goods and Cuman riddles. The first copy was written in the monastery of St. John near Saray. A later copy (1330‚Äì1340) is thought to have been written in a Franciscan friary. Later, different sections of the codex, such as the Interpreter's Book (which was for commercial, merchant use) and the Missionaries' Book (which contains sermons, psalms and other religious texts along with Cuman riddles) were combined. The Interpreter's Book consists of 110 pages; pages 1‚Äì63 contain alphabetically arranged verbs in Latin, Persian and Cuman. The Missionaries' Book contains vocabulary listings, grammatical notes, Cuman riddles, religious texts and some Italian verses. The Cuman riddles are the oldest documented material of Turkic riddles and constitute Turkic folklore. Some of the riddles have almost identical modern equivalents (for example Kazakh). The Codex Cumanicus is composed of several Cuman‚ÄìKipchak dialects. The Cumans' language was a form of Kipchak Turkic and was, until the 14th century, a lingua franca over much of the Eurasian steppes.Yule and Cordier 1916 A number of Cuman‚ÄìKipcaq‚ÄìArabic grammar glossaries appeared in Mamluk lands in the 14th and 15th centuries. It is supposed that the Cumans had their own writing system (mentioned by the historian Gy√°rf√°s), which could have been a runic script. The supposition that the Cumans had a runic script is also suggested by the academic Hakan Aydemir, who mentioned a buckle with runic writing from a Cuman grave There was also some Khazar Jewish linguistic influence upon the Cumans ‚Äì the Cuman words shabat and shabat kun (meaning Saturday) are related to the Hebrew word Shabbat (meaning Sabbath). These Hebrew influences in the language may have resulted from contact or intermarriege between Khazars and some of the Cumans in the mid-11th century. Polovtsian leaders * Iskal or Eskel (possibly a self-name of a Bulgaric tribe (Nushibi)) who were mentioned by Ahmad ibn Fadlan after visiting Volga region in 921‚Äì922. They also were mentioned by Abu Sa øƒ´d Gardƒìzƒ´ in his Zayn al-AkhbƒÅr. According to Bernhard Karlgren, Eskels became the Hungarian people Sz√©kelys. Yury Zuev thought that Iskal who is mentioned in the Laurentian Codex about the first military encounter of Cumans against the Ruthenians on February 2, 1061, is personification of a tribal name. * Sharukan/Sharagan (also known as Sharukan the Elder), grand father of Konchak. He was another Polovotsian khan who was victorious against the Ruthenian army of Yaroslavichi at the Alta river (Battle of the Alta River). According to the Novgorod First Chronicle Sharukan was taken as prisoner by Svyatoslav II of Kiev in 1068, while no such information is provided in the Laurentian Codex. In May 1107 along with Bonyak, Sharukan raided a couple of Ruthenian cities (Pereyaslav and Lubny), however already in August of the same year the collective Ruthenian army led by Svyatoslav carried out a devastating defeat to the Cuman Horde forcing Sharukan to flee. *Bonyak/Maniak,Bonyak at the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. Cuman khan who was actively involved in civil conflicts of Ruthenia. He had a brother Taz who perished at the battle on the Sula River in 1107. Bonyak was last mentioned in 1167 when he was defeated by Oleg of Siveria. Bonyak was a leader of the Cuman tribe Burchevichi that resided in steppes of the East Ukraine between modern cities of Zaporizhia and Donetsk. * Tugorkan (1028‚Äì1096), was mentioned in essays of the Byzantine Empress Anna Komnene along with his compatriot Bonyak. He perished with his son at the battle on the Trubizh River against the Ruthenian army. * Syrchan, a son of Sharukan. He was a leader of a Cuman tribe that lived on the right banks of Siversky Donets. Chronicles mentioned that after the death of Vladimir II Monomakh, grand prince of Kiev, Syrchan sent out an emissary and a singer Orev to Georgia after his brother Atrak/Otrok (who, with 40,000 Cuman troops, was in Georgia at the time), urging him to return. Khan Otrok agreed (giving up the fame and security he had won in Georgia), after smelling eyevshan, the grass of his native steppe. Syrchan was mentioned in the poem of Apollon Maykov (1821‚Äì1897) \\"Emshan\\". * Otrok/Atrak, a son of Sharukan and a brother of Syrchan. In 1111 he, along with his brother, withdrew to the Lower Don region after losing a battle against the Ruthenians. There Atrak's horde joined the local Alans. In 1117 his army sacked Sarkel and 5 other cities belonging to the Torkils and Berendei forcing the local Pechenegs, Berendei and Torkils to flee to Ruthenia. Around the same time Atrak invaded the Northern Caucasus where he entered into conflict with local Circassians pushing them beyond the Kuban River. The conflict was settled by a Georgian King David IV of Georgia who offered military service to Atrak against Seljuks in 1118. David also married the daughter of Atrak ‚Äì Gurandukht. After withdrawal of Atrak away from the Don region, the Alan's duchy in East Ukraine was liquidated in 1116‚Äì17. Atrak returned after the death of Vladimir Monomakh in 1125. * Khan Konchek/Konchak/Kumcheg (meaning 'trousers'), grandson of Sharukan, son of Khan Otrok. He united the tribes of the eastern Cumans in the later half of the 12th century, after which in the 1170s and 1180s he launched a number of particularly destructive attacks on the settlements in the Duchy of Kiev, the Principality of Chernigov and the Principality of Pereyaslavl. Konchak gave aid to the princes of the Principality of Novgorod-Seversk in their struggle for control with the other Rus' princes. Along with Khan Kobiak/Kobek, Khan Konchak was routed on the Khorol River in 1184 during an assault on Kyivan Rus'. In 1185, he defeated the army of Ihor Sviatoslavych, who was taken as a prisoner. Later, Konchak laid siege to Pereiaslav and ravaged the Chernihiv and Kyiv areas. His daughter married prince Vladimir Igorevich of Putivl (Igor's son). It is hypothesized that Konchek was with the Cumans who helped Riurik Rostislavovich seizure and sack of Kiev in 1202. Khan Konchek is credited with certain technological advancements, such as Greek fire and a special bow that needed 50 men to operate. Konchek was noted by the Rus' to be \\"greater than all the Cumans\\". He died in a skirmish that preceded the Battle of Kalka River. The struggle to repel Khan Konchak and his army by Ihor Sviatoslavych and the Rus' princes is immortalized in the epic The Tale of Igor's Campaign (\\"Slovo o polku Ihorevi).\\" Legacy Monument to the Asen dynasty in their capital Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria. The dynasty was of Cuman origin and was responsible for establishing the Second Bulgarian Empire. Sculptor: prof. Krum Damianov As the Cumans ceased to have a state of their own, they were gradually absorbed into Eurasian populations (certain families in Hungary, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Turkey, Romania, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Tatars in Crimea). The Cumans in Dobruja were assimilated into Bulgarian and Romanian people. Traces of the Cumans can still be found in placenames stretching from China to the Balkans, such as the city of Kumanovo in North Macedonia; a Slavic village named Kumanichevo in the Kostur (Kastoria) district of Greece, which was changed to Lithia after Greece obtained this territory in the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest; ComƒÉne≈üti in Romania; Kuman, a city in Xinjiang, China; Polovtsy, a town in Smolenskaya Oblast', Russia; Polovtsy in Mahilyowskaya Volblasts', Belarus; the steppes north of the Caucasus Mountains, referred to as Kuban as well as the Kuban River; the village of Kumane in Serbia; the village of Kumanitsa, in the municipality of Ivanjica, Serbia; the municipality of Kuman in the Fier District, Fier County, southwestern Albania; K√ºman, a village and municipality in the Lerik Rayon of Azerbaijan; the town and district of Ula≈ü in the Sivas province of Turkey; Comana in Northern Dobruja (also Romania); the small village of Kumanite in Bulgaria; Kuman, a town in Qashqadaryo, Uzbekistan; Kuman-san, a mountain peak near Ch'unch'≈èn, Gangwon, South Korea; the town of Kumanlar in Ordu, Turkey; Debrecen in Hungary; the village of Bugac in Hungary, the counties of B√°cs- Kiskun and J√°sz-Nagykun-Szolnok as well as the cities Kiskunhalas and Kunszentmikl√≥s in Hungary, the village of Kunmadaras in Greater Cumania, Hungary; and the town of Kumanov in Khmel'nyts'ka Oblast', Ukraine. The flower, Kumoniga (melilot), is also a relic of the Cumans. The Gagauz people are believed by some historians to be descendants of the Cumans; the name Qipcakli occurs as a modern Gagauz surname. The etymology of the Sea of Azov is popularly said to derive from a certain Cuman prince named Azum or Asuf, who was killed defending a town in this region in 1067. As the Mongols pushed westward and devastated their state, most of the Cumans fled to Hungary, as well as the Second Bulgarian Empire since they were major military allies. The Cuman participation in the creation of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1185 and thereafter brought about basic changes in the political and ethnic sphere of Bulgaria and the Balkans. Bulgarian Tsar Ivan-Asen II was descended from Cumans and settled them in the southern parts of the country, bordering the Latin Empire and the Thessallonikan Despotate. Those territories are in present-day Turkish Europe, Bulgaria, and North Macedonia. Kuns√°g (Cumania) in the 18th century within the Kingdom of Hungary. It was divided into Greater Cumania and Little Cumania. The Cumans who settled in Hungary had their own self-government in a territory that bore their name, Kuns√°g, that survived until the 19th century. Two regions ‚Äì Little Cumania and Greater Cumania ‚Äì exist in Hungary. The name of the Cumans (Kun) is preserved in county names such as B√°cs-Kiskun, Kunbaja and J√°sz-Nagykun-Szolnok, and town names such as Kiskunhalas, Kunszentmikl√≥s. The Cumans were organized into four tribes in Hungary: Kolbasz/Olas in upper Cumania around Karcag and the other three in lower Cumania. Cumania. Stained glass window in the southern nave of the St Elisabeth Cathedral, Ko≈°ice, Slovakia. The Cuman language disappeared from Hungary in the 17th or 18th centuries, possibly following the Turkish occupation. The last person, who was able to speak some Cumanian on a decaying level was Istv√°n Varr√≥ from Karcag, who died in 1770. During the 1740s, when Cuman was no longer spoken, a Cuman version of the Lord's Prayer suddenly surfaced. It was taught in schools in Greater Cumania and Little Cumania until the mid-20th century, in turn becoming a cornerstone of Cuman identity. In the 20th century enthusiastic self-styled Cumans collected 'Cuman folklore', which consisted of elements such as a traditional Cuman dance, Cuman characteristics such as pride and staunch Calvinism. (By religion, as may be seen by figures for religion in Hungary, the Kiskuns√°g is almost entirely Roman Catholic, whereas in Nagykuns√°g, Protestants do outnumber Catholics, but only narrowly.) This ethnic consciousness was linked to the legal privileges attached to the Cumans' territory. Their 19th-century biographer, Gy√°rf√°s Istv√°n, in 1870 was of the opinion that they originally spoke Hungarian, together with the Iazyges population. Despite this mistake, he has the best overview on the subject concerning details of material used. Cuman influence is also present in the modern Hungarian language in the form of loanwords, particularly in the areas of horse-breeding, eating, hunting and fighting. In 1918, after World War I, the Cuman National Council was formed in Hungary, which was an attempt to separate the Kuns√°g region (Greater Cumania and Little Cumania) from the Hungarian state, with the aim of forming a new independent Cuman state in Europe. The Cuman National Council declared the independence of Kuns√°g, and elected its president Count Gedeon R√°day on December 18. However the Council's efforts remained unsuccessful. In 1939, Cuman descendants organized celebrations for the 700th anniversary of their arrival in Hungary, where they emphasized their separate ethnic existence and identity with ceremonial speeches.A.

(Hungarian Academy of Sciences)[mek.oszk.hu/10600/10674/10674.doc] In 1995, The Cuman Memorial Site was inaugurated as a tribute to the Cuman ancestors and the redemption of the former Nagykun District. In 2009, and subsequently 2012, a World Meeting of the Cumans was held in Karcag. During the first meeting, which lasted two weeks, academic conferences, historical exhibitions, publications, presentations of traditional and cultural festivals and lectures in relation to the Cumans were held. In the 2012 meeting, the minister for rural development, S√°ndor Fazekas, mentioned how Cuman traditions are still kept alive, such as costumes, folk songs, and food. Toponyms of the Cuman language origin can be found in some Romanian counties of Vaslui and Gala≈£i, including the names of both counties. When some of the Cumans moved to Hungary, they brought with them their Komondor dogs. The Komondor breed has been declared one of Hungary's national treasures, to be preserved and protected from modification. The name Komondor derives from Koman-dor, meaning \\"Cuman dog\\". Cuman sculpture in Kharkiv, Ukraine. In the countries where the Cumans were assimilated, family surnames derived from the words for \\"Cuman\\" (such as coman or kun, \\"kuman\\") are not uncommon. Traces of the Cumans are the Bulgarian surnames Kunev or Kumanov (feminine Kuneva, Kumanova) and Asenov, its variants in North Macedonia Kunevski, Kumanovski (feminine Kumanovska); the Kazakh surname Kumanov; the widespread Hungarian surname Kun; the Hungarian surnames of Csertan, Csoreg, Kokscor, Karacs, Kekcse; the Hungarian surname of Kangur ‚Äì a byname of one of the families of Karcag (the words Kangur and Karcag derive from Qongur and Qarsaq respectively, and occur as modern day clan names of the Kazakhs ‚Äì the Kipchak tribes Qongur and Qarsaq, as well as names used by the Kirgyz in the Manas epic ‚Äì mentioned as Kongur-bay, lord of the Mongol Kalmyk people and the warrior Kongrolu); the Hungarian surname of Kapscog (from \\"Kipchak\\")- Kapsog Tojasos Kovacs, a byname of Kovacs family, as well as the name of Eszenyi Kopscog of Hungary; and the Greek surname Asan. The names \\"Coman\\" in Romania and its derivatives, however, do not appear to have any connection to the medieval Cumans, as it was unrecorded until very recent times and the places with the highest frequency of such names has not produced any archaeological evidence of Cuman settlement.Spinei, Victor. The Cuman Bishopric ‚Äì Genesis and Evolution. in The Other Europe: Avars, Bulgars, Khazars and Cumans. Edited by Florin Curta and Roman Kovalev. Brill Publishing. 2008. p. 64 Over time, Cuman culture exerted an influence on the CeangƒÉi/Hungarian Csangos and Romanian culture in Moldavia, due to the Hungarians in Moldavia socializing and mingling with the Cumans between the 14th and 15th centuries. Hakan Aydemir, a Turkic linguist, states that the 'ir' of the CeangƒÉi/Csangos and Sz√©kelys dialect, which means 'carve', 'notch', as well as the words 'urk/uruk' (meaning 'lasso', 'noose'), 'dszepu (meaning 'wool') and 'korhany' (meaning 'small mountain', 'hill') are of Cuman‚ÄìKipchak origin. Additionally, the Cumans could have also had some connection with Sz√©kelys runes. Several Romanian as well as Hungarian academics believe that a significant Cuman population lived in Moldavia in the 15th century; these Cumans later assimilated into the Romanian population. People in Hungary with the surname Pal√≥c are descended from the Cumans (and possibly Kabars and Pechenegs) ‚Äì Pal√≥c origintates from the Slavic word Polovets/Polovtsy.Andrew Bell-Fialkoff, The Role of Migration in the History of the Eurasian Steppe: Sedentary Civilization vs. 'Barbarian' and Nomad , Palgrave Macmillan, 2000, p. 247 Although the Pal√≥cs were similar to the Hungarians in origins and culture, they were considered distinct groups by the Turks. The first written record of the word \\"pal√≥c\\" as the name of a people appears in the Mez≈ëk√∂vesd register in 1784. Scholars believe there is also no connection between the Cumans and the Dutch surnames Kooman(s), Koman(s), Koeman(s), (De) Cooman(s) and Coman(s), used particularly in the Flemish area and the Dutch county of Zealand. They believe these surnames are medieval and were used in the meaning of 'merchant'. The Cumans appear in Rus' culture in the Rus' epic poem The Tale of Igor's Campaign and are the military enemies of the Rus' in Alexander Borodin's opera Prince Igor, which features a set of Polovtsian Dances. The name Cuman is the name of several villages in Turkey, such as Kumanlar, including the Black Sea region. The indigenous people in the Altai Republic, Kumandins (Kumandy), are descended from the Cumans.Potapov L. P., Ibid, p. 58Pritsak O., \\"Stammesnamen und Titulaturen der altaischen Volker. Ural-Altaische JahrMcher\\", Bd. 24, 1952, Sect. 1‚Äì2, pp. 49‚Äì104Potapov L.P., Ibid, p. 59 By the 17th century, the Kumandins lived along the river Charysh, near its confluence with the river Ob. A subsequent relocation to the Altai was driven by their unwillingness to pay yasak (financial tribute) to the Russian sovereign. N. Aristov linked the Kumandins ‚Äì and the Chelkans ‚Äì to the ancient Turks, \\"who in the 6th-8th CC. CE created in Central Asia a powerful nomadic state, which received ... the name Turkic Kaganate\\".Aristov N. A., Notes on ethnic composition of T√ºrkic tribes and nations//Olden Times Alive, 1896, v. 3‚Äì4, p. 341 Persons of Cuman/Kipchak origin also became Mamluk leaders - a prominent Cuman Sultan of the Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate, Sultan Baibars (reigned 1260‚Äì1277), defeated King Louis IX of France (Seventh Crusade ‚Äì 1248‚Äì1254) and resisted the Mongol invasion, defeating the Mongol army at the Battle of Ain Jalut (1260) and the Battle of Elbistan (1277) (by using the feigned-retreat tactic). Mamluks in the empire retained a particularly strong sense of Cuman identity, to the degree that the biography of Sultan Baibars, as reflected by Ibn Shaddad, focused on his birth and early years in Desht-i- Kipchak (\\"Steppe of the Kipchaks\\"/Cumania), as well as enslavement and subsequent travels to Bulgaria and the Near East. The historian Dimitri Korobeinikov relates how Baibars' story sums up the tragic fate of many Cumans after the Battle of the Kalka River (1223) and the Mongol invasion of Europe (1223‚Äì1242). Roman Kovalev states that this story can further be seen as a mechanism for the preservation of a collective memory broadly reflecting a sense of Cuman identity in the Mamluk Sultanate. In the latter part of the 1260s the Mamluks were allied with the Golden Horde against the Ilkhanate. The creation of this specific warrior class, described as the \\"mamluk phenomenon\\" by David Ayalon, was of great political importance. In the Hungarian village of Csengele, on the borders of what is still called Kiskunsag (\\"Little Cumania\\"), an archeological excavation in 1975 revealed the ruins of a medieval church with 38 burials. Several burials had all the characteristics of a Cumanian group: richly jeweled, non-Hungarian, and definitely Cumanian- type costumes; the 12-spiked mace as a weapon; bone girdles; and associated pig bones.Horvath 1978; Kovacs 1971; Sandor 1959. In view of the cultural objects and the historical data, the archeologists concluded that the burials were indeed Cumanian from the mid-13th century; hence some of the early settlers in Hungary were from that ethnic group. In 1999 the grave of a high- status Cumanian from the same period was discovered about 50 meters from the church of Csengele; this was the first anthropologically authenticated grave of a Cumanian chieftain in Hungary, and the contents are consistent with the ethnic identity of the excavated remains from the church burials. A separated area of the chieftain grave contained a complete skeleton of a horse. = Genetics = The ethnic origins of the Cumanians are uncertain. The Cumans were reported to have had blond hair, fair skin and blue eyes (which set them apart from other groups and later puzzled historians), although they were often distinguished by their Altaic-Mongoloid features. A genetic study done on Cuman burials in Hungary determined that they had substantially more western Eurasian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages. In a 2005 study by Erika Bogacsi-Szabo et al. of the mtDNA of the Cuman nomad population that migrated into the Carpathian basin during the 13th century, six haplogroups were revealed. > One of these haplogroups belongs to the M lineage (haplogroup D) and is > characteristic of Eastern Asia, but this is the second most frequent > haplogroup in southern Siberia too. All the other haplogroups (H, V, U, U3, > and JT) are West Eurasian, belonging to the N macrohaplogroup. Out of the > eleven remains, four samples belonged to haplogroup H, two to haplogroup U, > two to haplogroup V, and one each to the JT, U3, and D haplogroups. In > comparison to the Cumans, modern Hungarian samples represent 15 haplogroups. > All but one is a West Eurasian haplogroup [the remaining one is East Asian > (haplogroup F)], but all belong to the N lineage. Four haplogroups (H, V, > U*, JT), present in the ancient samples, can also be found in the modern > Hungarians, but only for haplogroups H and V were identical haplotypes > found. Haplogroups U3 and D occur exclusively in the ancient group, and 11 > haplogroups (HV, U4, U5, K, J, J1a, T, T1, T2, W, and F) occur only in the > modern Hungarian population. Haplogroup frequency in the modern Hungarian > population is similar to other European populations, although haplogroup F > is almost absent in continental Europe; therefore the presence of this > haplogroup in the modern Hungarian population can reflect some past > contribution. \\"The results suggested that the Cumanians, as seen in the > excavation at Csengele, were far from genetic homogeneity.

It is interesting > that the only skeleton for which anthropological examination indicated a > partly European ancestry was that of the chieftain, whose haplotype is most > frequently found in the Balkans.\\" The study concluded that the mitochondrial motifs of Cumans from Csengele show the genetic admixtures with other populations rather than the ultimate genetic origins of the founders of Cuman culture. The study further mentioned, \\"This may be the result of the habits of the Cumanian nomads. Horsemen of the steppes formed a political unit that was independent from their maternal descent or their language and became members of a tribal confederation. According to legends, Cumanians frequently carried off women from raided territories. So the maternal lineages of a large part of the group would reflect the maternal lineage of those populations that had geographic connection with Cumanians during their migrations. Nevertheless, the Asian mitochondrial haplotype in sample Cu26 may still reflect the Asian origins of the Cumanians of Csengele. However, by the time the Cumanians left the Trans- Carpathian steppes and settled in Hungary, they had acquired several more westerly genetic elements, probably from the Slavic, Finno-Ugric, and Turkic- speaking peoples who inhabited the regions north of the Black and Caspian Seas.\\" The results from the Cuman samples were plotted on a graph with other Eurasian populations, showing the genetic distances between them. The Eurasian populations were divided into two distinct clusters. One cluster contained all the Eastern and Central Asian populations and can be divided into two subclusters; one subcluster includes mainly Eastern Asian populations (Buryat, Korean and Kirghiz Lowland populations), and the other subcluster harbors mainly Central Asian populations (Mongolian, Kazakh, Kirghiz Highland and Uyghur populations). The second cluster contained the European populations. Inside the second cluster, based on HVS I motifs, a clear structure was not detectable, but almost all European populations, including the modern Hungarians, assembled in one section with small distances between each other. Cumans were outside this section; they were found to be above the abscissa of the graph ‚Äì this is the population from the second cluster, which is closest to the East-Central Asian cluster. The modern Cumans of Csengele, Hungary are genetically nearest to the Finnish, Komi and Turkish populations. The modern day Cuman descendants in Hungary are differentiated genetically from the Hungarians and other European populations.Bennett, Casey and Frederika A. Kaestle (2006) \\"A Reanalysis of Eurasian Population History: Ancient DNA Evidence of Population Affinities\\" Human Biology 78: 413‚Äì440 . In relation to the Kumandins, Potapov regarded the Kumandins as being related anthropologically to the Urals, and suggested that they were less East Asian than the Altaians proper. A majority of mitochondrial DNA lines belonged to the North East Asian haplogroups C or D with also a large minority of west Eurasian lineages such as U.

The confederation was dominated by two Turkic nomadic tribes: the Cumans (also known as the Polovtsians or Folban) and the Kipchaks. Cumania was known in Islamic sources as Desht-i Qipchaq, which means \\"Steppe of the Kipchaks\\"; or \\"foreign land sheltering the Kipchaks\\", in the Turkic languages.Adjiev M. Eskenderovich, The Kipchaks, An Ancient History of the Turkic People and the Great Steppe, Moscow 2002, p.30 Russian sources have referred to Cumania as the \\"Polovtsian Steppe\\" (Poloveckaja Step), or the \\"Polovcian Plain\\" (Pole Poloveckoe). The Golden Horde was also referred to as \\"Comania\\" by Armenian chronicler Hethum (Hayton) of Korykos.Victor Spinei, The Romanians and the Turkic Nomads North of the Danube Delta from the Tenth to the Mid-thirteenth Century, p.38. \\"Cumania\\" was also the source of names, or alternate names, for several smaller areas ‚Äì some of them unconnected geographically to the area of the federation ‚Äì in which Cumans and/or Kipchaks settled, such as the historic region of Kuns√°g in Hungary, and the former Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania (in Romania and Hungary). Hethum of Korykos described Cumania as \\"wholly flat and with no trees\\". Ibn Battuta said of Cumania, \\"This wilderness is green and grassy with no trees, nor hills, high or low ... there is no means of travelling in this desert except in wagons.\\" Battuta's contemporary, Hamdallah Mustawfi, elaborated, \\"This is of the Sixth Clime, its plains bear excellent pasturage ... but there are here few houses or towns or villages. Most of the inhabitants are nomads of the plain ... Most of the lands here are swamps ... The pasturage, however, being excellent, horses and cattle are numerous, and the population for the most part subsists on the produce thereof. The climate is cold, and their water comes from springs and wells.\\"Victor Spinei, The Romanians and the Turkic Nomads North of the Danube Delta from the Tenth to the Mid-thirteenth Century, p.40. Meaning Kazakh Tamga of Kypchak tribe By the 11th and 12th centuries, the nomadic confederacy of the Cumans and (Eastern) Kipchaks (who were a distinct tribe with whom the Cumans created a confederacy) were the dominant force over the vast territories stretching from the present-day Kazakhstan, southern Russia, Ukraine, to southern Moldavia and eastern Wallachia. Considering the nomadic way of life of these peoples, these frontiers can be regarded only as approximate; hence there were various definitions over what Cumania meant over the course of time. Depending on their region and their time, different sources each used their own vision to denote different sections of the vast Cuman territory: in Byzantine, Russian, Georgian, Armenian, Persian and Muslim sources, Cumania meant the Pontic steppe, that is the steppelands to the north of the Black Sea and on its eastern side as far as the Caspian Sea, where the lowlands between the Dnieper, the Volga, the Ural and the Irtysh rivers were favorable to the nomadic lifestyle of the Cumans. Later, for a short time period, in Western sources Cumania also referred to the area in eastern Wallachia and southern Ukraine (centered on the lowlands of Budjak and the BƒÉrƒÉgan Plain), referring to the area where the first contact between the Cumans and the Western Christians took place, and where, later, the Cumans of the region would accept Roman Catholicism. Using the traditional Turkic assignment of colours to the cardinal points, White Cumania used to be located to the west and may have denoted eastern Wallachia, while Black Cumania was located to its north and may have denoted Moldavia. As in the case of many other large nomadic Eurasian confederacies, the ethnonym \\"Cuman\\" (referring to the inhabitants of Cumania) denoted different ethnic realities. While the main component was probably the Turkic-speaking tribes, the confederacy included other ethnic components as well. Cumania was primarily a political name, referring to the leading, integrating tribe or clan of the confederacy or state. The Cumans, when they first appear in written sources, are members of a confederacy irrespective of their tribal origin. Former tribal names disappeared when the tribe in question became part of a political unit. For instance, when we hear of an incursion of Cumans, it means that certain tribes of the Cuman confederacy took part in a military enterprise. In his \\"History of the Mongols\\", the Persian historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, referred to Cumania around 1236‚Äì1237, during the Mongol invasion of M√∂ngke, the future Great Khan of the Mongol Empire. Among others, he mentions the Kipchaks, the Turkophone Asi (probably the same as the later Jassic tribe) and the \\"Karaulaghi\\" (Black, i.e. \\"from the north\\", Vlachs).Alexandru D. Xenopol in \\"Histoire des Roumains', Paris, 1896, i, 168 quotes Rashid-od-Din: Cuman/Kipchak statue, 12th century, Luhansk The vast territory of this Cuman-Kipchak realm, consisting of loosely connected tribal units who were the military dominating force, was never politically united by a strong central power. Cumania was neither a state nor an empire, but different groups under independent rulers, or khans, who acted on their own initiative, meddling in the political life of the surrounding states: the Russian principalities, Bulgaria, Byzantium and the Wallachian states in the Balkans, Armenia and Georgia (see Kipchaks in Georgia) in the Caucasus, and Khwarezm, having reached as far as to create a powerful caste of warriors, the Mamluks, serving the Muslim Arab and Turkish Caliphs and Sultans. In the Balkans, we find the Cumans in contact with all of the statal entities of that time, fighting with the Kingdom of Hungary, allied with the Bulgarians and Vlachs against the Byzantine Empire For example, Thocomerius, by name apparently a Cuman warlord (also known as Tihomir, he might have been a Bulgarian noble), was possibly the first one to unite the Bulgarian states, north from the Danube, from the west and the east of the Olt River, and his son Basarab I is considered the first ruler of the united and independent Wallachia. This interpretation corresponds with the general view of the situation of the Romanian lands in the 11th century, with the natives living in collections of village communities, united in various small confederacies, with more or less powerful chiefs trying to create little kingdoms, some paying tribute to the various militarily dominant nomadic tribes (see Romania in the Middle Ages). This pontic Cumania, (and the rest of the Cumanias to the east), ended its existence in the middle of the 13th century, with the Great Mongol Invasion of Europe. In 1223, Genghis Khan defeated the Cumans and their Rus' allies at the Battle of Kalka (in modern Ukraine), and the final blow came in 1241, when the Cuman confederacy ceased to exist as a political entity, with the remaining Cuman tribes being dispersed, either becoming subjects of the Mongol conquerors as part of what was to be known as the Golden Horde, or fleeing to the west, to the Byzantine Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary. Kuns√°g and the Catholic Diocese of Cumania Coat of Arms of early modern Kuns√°g On the Great Hungarian Plain, Cuman settlers gave their name to two regions known as Kuns√°g, the Hungarian word for Cumania: Greater Cumania (Nagykuns√°g) and Little Cumania (Kiskuns√°g), located on the Great Hungarian Plain. Here, the Cumans maintained their language and some ethnic customs well into the modern era. Cumania name was also preserved as part of the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical structure with a \\"Diocese of Cumania\\" existing until 1523 in what is now Romania, long after the Cumans ceased to be a distinct group in the area. At Milcovul, years earlier, in 1227, the Cuman warlord Bortz accepted Catholic Christianity from missionary Dominican friars. Pope Gregory IX heard about the mass conversion of the Cumans, and on 1 July 1227 empowered Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom, to represent him to Cumania and in neighbouring Land of the Brodnici. Teodoric, the bishop of this new diocese, became the guardian of the Dominican Order in the Kingdom of Hungary.The letter of Pope Gregory the IXth: Hence, Cumania diocese became part of the superior archbishopric of Esztergom, determining King B√©la IV of Hungary to add \\"Rex Cumaniae\\" (King of Cumania)The full list of titles was *Bela Dei gratia Hungariae *Dalmatiae *Croatiae *Romae *Serviae *Gallicie *Lodomerie *Cumanieque Rex . to his titles in 1228, and later to grant asylum to the Cumans in face of the Mongol invasion. The Diocese of Cumania, or of Milcovul, had subordinated in Transylvania the abbacy of Sibiu, the dioceses of Burzenland, Brasso and Orbai, and over the Carpathians, in the lands of the \\"infidel\\" Orthodox Vlachs (in partibus infidelium), all the Christian Catholics, irrespective of their ethnicity, despite the fact that many believers fell under the influence of the Romanian Orthodox \\"pseudo\\" bishops (episcopo Cumanorum, qui loci diocesanus existit, sed a quibusdam pseudoepiscopis Graecorum ritum tenentibus).The full text of the letter of Pope Gregory the IXth to King B√©la of Hungary (14 November 1234) is: . So, at that moment, Hungarian and Papal documents use the name Cumania to refer to the land between the eastern border of the lands of Seneslau and the land of the Brodnici (BuzƒÉu, southern Vrancea and southern Gala≈£i): that is Cumania meant, more or less, Muntenia. At that time, the use of the name Cumania should not to be understood as asserting the existence of a Cuman state, nor even a land inhabited by Cuman tribes (as the bulk of them had either fled, or were destroyed by the Mongols, and the rest had been absorbed) but rather to the Diocese of Cumania. From the military point of view, the land comprising the Diocese of Cumania was held either by the Teutonic Order (as early as 1222), or by the Vlachs (Brodnics or the Vlachs of Seneslau). The term Cumania had come to mean any Catholic subordinated to the Milcovul Diocese, so much so that in some cases, the terms Cuman and Wallach (more precisely, Roman Catholic Wallach, as the Orthodox Christians were considered schismatic, and the Pope did not officially recognise them) were interchangeable,The Diploma of King Andrew of Hungary, 11 March 1291, mentions the 'universities' of Saxon, Siculian and Wallachian nobles at Alba Iulia, yet at the assembly of Buda on 29 July 1292 there is mention of the 'universitas nobilium Ongarorum, Siculorum, Saxonum et Comanorum'; the term Cumans simply replacing that of Wallachs.

It was established jointly in 1916 by the Maharaja of Darbhanga Rameshwar Singh, Madan Mohan Malaviya, Sunder Lal and British Theosophist and Home Rule League founder Annie Besant. With over 30,000 students residing in campus, it is the largest residential university in Asia. The university's main campus spread over was built on land donated by the Kashi Naresh Prabhu Narayan Singh, the hereditary ruler of Banaras (\\"Kashi\\" being an alternative name for Banaras or Varanasi). The south campus, spread over , hosts the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (Agriculture Science Centre) and is located in Barkachha in Mirzapur district, about from Banaras. BHU is organised into six institutes and 14 faculties (streams) and about 140 departments. , the total student enrolment at the university is 27,359 coming from 48 countries. It has over 75 hostels for resident students. Several of its faculties and institutes include arts (FA - BHU), commerce (Faculty of Commerce, Banaras Hindu University), management studies (Institute of Management Studies Banaras Hindu UniversityI.M.St. - BHU), science (I.Sc. - BHU), performing arts (FPA-BHU), law (FL-BHU), agricultural science (Institute of Agricultural Science, Banaras Hindu UniversityI.A.S. - BHU), medical science (Institute of Medical Science, Banaras Hindu UniversityI.M.S. - BHU) and environment and sustainable development (Institute of Environment And Sustainable Development, Banaras Hindu UniversityI.E.S.D. - BHU) along with departments of linguistics, journalism & mass communication, among others. The university's engineering institute was designated as an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT BHU) in June 2012. BHU celebrated its centenary year in 2015‚Äì2016. The Centenary Year Celebration Cell organised various programs including cultural programs, feasts, competitions and Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya Birth Anniversary on 25 December 2015. History Statue of Madan Mohan Malaviya at the entrance of Shri Vishwanath Mandir The Banaras Hindu University was jointly established by Madan Mohan Malaviya. A prominent lawyer and an Indian independence activist, Malaviya considered education as the primary means for achieving a national awakening. At the 21st Conference of the Indian National Congress in Benares in December 1905, Malaviya publicly announced his intent to establish a university in Varanasi. Malaviya continued to develop his vision for the university with inputs from other Indian nationalists and educationists. He published his plan in 1911. The focus of his arguments was the prevailing poverty in India and the decline in income of Indians compared to Europeans. The plan called for the focus on technology and science, besides the study of India's religion and culture: > \\"The millions mired in poverty here can only get rid (of it) when science is > used in their interest. Such maximum application of science is only possible > when scientific knowledge is available to Indians in their own country.\\" Malaviya's plan evaluated whether to seek government recognition for the university or operate without its control. He decided in favour of the former for various reasons. Malaviya also considered the question of medium of instruction and decided to start with English given the prevalent environment, and gradually add Hindi and other Indian languages. A distinguishing characteristic of Malaviya's vision was the preference for a residential university. All other Indian universities of the period, such as the universities in Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, etc., were affiliating universities which only conducted examinations and awarded degrees to students of their affiliated colleges. Malaviya had supported Annie Besant's cause and in 1903, he had raised 250,000 Rupees in donations to finance the construction of the school's hostel. In 1907 Besant had applied for a royal charter to establish a university. However, there was no response from the British government. Following the publication of Malviya's plan, Besant met Malviya and in April 1911 they agreed to unite their forces to build the university in Varanasi. Malaviya soon left his legal practice to focus exclusively on developing the university and his independence activities. On 22 November 1911, he registered the Hindu University Society to gather support and raise funds for building the university. He spent the next four years gathering support and raising funds for the university. Malaviya sought and received early support from the Kashi Naresh Prabhu Narayan Singh and Rameshwar Singh Bahadur of Raj Darbhanga. Thakur Jadunath Singh of Arkha along with other noble houses of United Provinces contributed for the development of the university. In October 1915, with support from Malaviya's allies in the Indian National Congress, the Banaras Hindu University Bill was passed by the Imperial Legislative Council. BHU was finally established in 1916, the first university in India that was the result of a private individual's efforts. The foundation for the main campus of the university was laid by Lord Hardinge, the then Viceroy of India, on Vasant Panchami 4 February 1916. To promote the university's expansion, Malviya invited eminent guest speakers such as Mahatma Gandhi, Jagadish Chandra Bose, C. V. Raman, Prafulla Chandra Roy, Sam Higginbottom, Patrick Geddes, and Besant to deliver a series of what are now called The University Extension Lectures between 5‚Äì8 February 1916. Gandhi's lecture on the occasion was his first public address in India. Sunder Lal was appointed the first Vice-Chancellor, and the university began its academic session the same month with classes initially held at the Central Hindu School in the Kamachha area, while the campus was being built on over of land donated by the Kashi Naresh on the outskirts of the city. The Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar, Mir Osman Ali Khan, also made a donation of lakh for the university. The university's anthem, known as the Kulgeet, was composed by Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar. Campus =Main campus= Dept of Electrical Engineering IIT-BHU Sir Sundarlal Hospital Ruiya Medical Hostel, BHU BHU is located on the southern edge of Varanasi, near the banks of the river Ganges. Development of the main campus, spread over , started in 1916 on land donated by the then Kashi Naresh Prabhu Narayan Singh. The campus layout approximates a semicircle, with intersecting roads laid out along the radii or in arcs. Buildings built in the first half of the 20th century are fine examples of Indo-Gothic architecture. The campus has over 60 hostels offering residential accommodation for over 12,000 students. On-campus housing is also available to a majority of the full-time faculty.

The Sayaji Rao Gaekwad Library is the main library on campus and houses over 1.3 million volumes as of 2011. Completed in 1941, its construction was financed by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda. In addition to the main library, there are three institute libraries, eight faculty libraries and over 25 departmental libraries available to students and staff. Sir Sunderlal Hospital on the campus is a teaching hospital for the Institute of Medical Sciences. Established in 1926 with 96 beds, it has since been expanded to over 900 beds and is the largest tertiary referral hospital in the region. Shri Vishwanath Mandir has the tallest temple tower in the world. The most prominent landmark is the Shri Vishwanath Mandir, located in the centre of the campus. The foundation for this high complex of seven temples was laid in March 1931, and took almost three decades to complete. Bharat Kala Bhavan is an art and archaeological museum on the campus. Established in January 1920, its first chairman was Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, with his nephew Abanindranath Tagore as the vice-chairman. The museum was expanded and gained prominence with the efforts of Rai Krishnadasa. The museum is best known for its collection of Indian paintings, but also includes archaeological artefacts, textiles and costumes, Indian philately as well as literary and archival materials. The Alice Boner Gallery was also set up at Bharat Kala Bhavan with the assistance of the Alice Boner Foundation in 1989 to mark the birth centenary of Alice Boner. = Rajiv Gandhi South Campus = The south campus is located in Barkachha in Mirzapur district, about southwest of the main campus.

Jacques Lemercier (c. 1585 in Pontoise - 13 January 1654 in Paris) was a French architect and engineer, one of the influential trio that included Louis Le Vau and Fran√ßois Mansart who formed the classicizing French Baroque manner, drawing from French traditions of the previous century and current Roman practice the fresh, essentially French synthesis associated with Cardinal Richelieu and Louis XIII. Life and career Lemercier was born in Pontoise. He was the son of a master mason, probably Nicolas Lemercier, one of a large interrelated tribe of professionals. Profiting by a voyage to Italy with a long stay in Rome, presumably from about 1607 to 1610, Lemercier developed the simplified classicizing manner established by Salomon de Brosse, who died in 1636, and whose Palais du Luxembourg for Marie de Medici Lemercier would see to completion. Lemercier's Pavillon de l‚ÄôHorloge at the Louvre On his return to France, after several years working as an engineer building bridges, his first major commission, however, was to complete the Parisian Church of the Oratorians, (1616), which had been begun by Cl√©ment M√©tezeau; its success made his reputation. As early as 1618 he appears as architecte du roy, with a salary of 1200 livres, out of which he had to reimburse his atelier. In 1625 Richelieu put him in charge of the main royal project, the galleries being added to the Louvre, where Lemercier was working to the design established by Pierre Lescot a generation before; for the sake of regularity, Lescot's ranges in the Cour Carr√© were multiplied round further courtyards, quadrupling the building area, each of the four sides having a pavilion at its center. In this manner Lemercier built the northern half of the west side and the famous Pavillon de l'Horloge at the center of the west wing. Its high squared dome breaks the wing's roofline and three arched openings provide access to the enclosed court. Two superposed orders of columns and rich sculptural decor in pediments and niches, on piers and panels are kept under control by strong horizontal cornice lines. During 1638 and 1639, Lemercier was appointed premier architecte charged with supervision of all the royal building enterprises, in which capacity he fell into a disagreeable dispute with the cultivated Nicolas Poussin about the decorations in the Louvre. The H√¥tel de Liancourt (1623) stands out among Lemercier's Paris h√¥tels particuliers for aristocratic patrons. Relief of ship anchors and prows, a surviving remnant of Lemercier's Palais-Cardinal Lemercier built (from 1627 on) Richelieu's Paris residence, the Palais-Cardinal, today's Palais Royal. \\"Richelieu's palace was destroyed by fire in 1763. Only one remnant survives: a wall fragment with a relief of ship anchors and prows, signs of the Cardinal's role as Superintendent of the Navy, which appeared throughout the palace.\\"Ballon 2002, p. 247. This remnant is located in the Galerie des Proues, on the east side of the second court (on the garden side), the so- called Cour d'Honneur.Not to be confused with a cour d'honneur, a term usually applied to the entrance court of an h√¥tel particulier. A more expansive town- planning project, one of the most ambitious non-military French projects of the century, was the palatial residence, the grand parish church and the entire new town of Richelieu, in Poitou (Indre-et-Loire). The lost Ch√¢teau de Richelieu itself was an improvisation on the theme set by Brosse's Luxembourg. Also for the Cardinal Lemercier rebuilt the Ch√¢teau de Rueil, not so far from Paris, also demolished. The Ch√¢teau of Thouars, with its majestic long fa√ßade, is his also, and survives. Less known, because gardens are less permanent, are parterre gardens laid out to Lemercier's designs, at Montjeu, at Richelieu and at Rueil (Mignot; Gady). Image:Sorbonne DSC09369.jpgthumbleftThe chapel at the Sorbonne, 1635: prototype for Mansart's at Les Invalides. At the Sorbonne, the college has been rebuilt, but its domed church (1635) is the acknowledged surviving masterpiece of Lemercier. The hemispherical dome on a tall octagonal drum, first of its type in France, has four small cupolas in the angles of the Greek cross above the two Corinthian orders on the fa√ßade, of full columns below, flat pilasters above. The interior was intended to be frescoed. The square intersection is surrounded by cylindrical vaults and a semicircular choir apse. The north side consists of a portico. In the church Richelieu was interred in 1642. At the royal abbey church of Val-de-Gr√¢ce Lemercier succeeded the elder Mansart who completed the structure to the cornice line, and refused to agree to a change in the building's design. Lemercier completed it with a dome. Saint-Roch, Paris, in a pen-and-ink drawing by Charles Norry, 1787. Lemercier was engaged by Louis XIII in initial planning for an expansion of the hunting lodge at Versailles, a project which was only realized by other architects, notably Louis Le Vau and Jules Hardouin-Mansart, under the guidance of Louis XIV. One of his last commissions was the design of the Church of Saint-Roch, where the cornerstone was laid by Louis XIV in 1653. With a length of 126 m. it is one of the largest churches of Paris. the deep choir emphasizes the extent of the interior, scarcely interrupted by the discreet low dome over the crossing, which is hidden on the exterior beneath the transept roof. Lemercier completed the choir and crossing and the rest of the interior was carried out to his plan. Work was interrupted 1701-1740 save for a chapel inserted 1705-1710 designed by Jules Hardouin- Mansart. The present fa√ßade is an 18th-century composition by Robert de Cotte. In a long career, the scrupulous Lemercier amassed no fortune. Through in 1645, Lemercier was receiving, as first among the royal architects (premier architecte du Roi), a salary of 3,000 livres, after his death-- in the house he had built for himself, still standing at n¬∞ 46 rue de l‚ÄôArbre Sec (Gady)-- it was necessary to sell the large library he had collected, in order to settle his debts. Lemercier died in Paris. He was succeeded as first royal architect by Louis Le Vau.

There is no historical dictionary for the universal names, classification or terminology of swords; A sword was simply a double edged knife. Historical terms without a universal consensus of definition (i.e. \\"arming sword\\", \\"broadsword\\", \\"long sword\\", etc.) were used to label weapons of similar appearance but of different historical periods, regional cultures and fabrication technology. These terms were often described in relation to other unrelated weapons, without regard to their intended use and fighting style. In modern history, many of these terms have been given specific, often arbitrary meanings that are unrelated to any of their historical meanings. Terminology Some of these terms originate contemporaneously with the weapons which they describe. Others are modern or early modern terms used by antiquarians, curators, and modern-day sword enthusiasts for historical swords. Terminology was further complicated by terms introducede.g., \\"hand-and-a-half sword\\", \\"single-handed sword\\", \\"Pappenheimer\\"[ ] \\"Walloon sword\\", \\"Sinclair Sabre\\", \\"Mortuary sword\\", \\"spada da lato\\", \\"town sword\\", etc. or misinterpretede.g., bastard sword, broadsword [] rapier, estoc, flamberge, etc. in the 19th century by antiquarians and in 20th century pop culture,sword and sorcery fiction, role playing games, fighting games, etc. and by the addition of new terms such as \\"great sword\\", \\"Zweih√§nder\\" (instead of Beidh√§nder), and \\"cut-and-thrust sword\\".\\"cut-and- thrust sword\\" Historical European Martial Arts associations have turned the term spada da latoA term that was coined by Italian curators into \\"side- sword\\". Furthermore, there is a deprecation of the term \\"broadsword\\" by these associations. All these newly introduced or redefined terms add to the confusion of the matter. The most well-known systematic typology of blade types of the European medieval sword is the Oakeshott typology, although this is also a modern classification and not a medieval one. Elizabethans used descriptive terms such as \\"short\\", \\"bastard\\", and \\"long\\" which emphasized the length of the blade, and \\"two-handed\\" for any sword that could be wielded by two hands. Classification by hilt type =Handedness= The term two- handed sword, used as a general term, may refer to any large sword designed to be used primarily with two hands: * the European longsword, popular in the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance. ** the Scottish late medieval claymore (not to be confused with the basket-hilted claymore of the 18th century) * the Bidenh√§nder sword favoured by the Landsknechte of 16th-century Germany. The term \\"hand-and-a-half sword\\" is modern (late 19th century). During the first half of the 20th century, the term \\"bastard sword\\" was used regularly to refer to this type of sword, while \\"long sword\\" or \\"long-sword\\", if used at all, referred to the rapier (in the context of Renaissance or Early Modern fencing). The term \\"single-handed sword\\" (or \\"one-handed sword\\") is a retronym coined to disambiguate from \\"two-handed\\" or \\"hand-and-a-half\\" specimens. \\"Single-handed sword\\" is used by Sir Walter Scott.in Death of the Laird's Jock (1831). It is also used as a possible gloss of the obscure term tonsword by Nares (1822);Robert Nares, A glossary; or, Collection of words ... which have been thought to require illustration, in the works of English authors (1822). \\"one-handed sword\\" is somewhat later, recorded from c. 1850. Apparently, some swords were designed for left-hand use, although left-handed swords have been described as \\"a rarity\\".Tony Willis, \\"A Pair of Scottish Swords\\", Page One, Page Two, Page Three, Page Four. Great sword Great swords or greatswords are related to the long swords of the Middle Ages.Oakeshott, Ewart. The Sword in the Age of Chivalry. Boydell Press 1994. Page 42-46.Oakeshott, Ewart. Records of the Medieval Sword. Boydell Press 1991. Page 89 and 95. The great sword proper was developed during the Renaissance, but its earlier cousin, the Scottish Claymore, was very similar in size and use, like the \\"outsized specimens\\" between 160 cm and 180 cm (approx. the same height as the user) such as the Oakeshott type XIIa or Oakeshott type XIIIa. These swords were too heavy to be wielded one-handed and possessed a large grip for leverage, the point would be to hold the grip with one hand at the top of the grip, and one hand at the bottom. The top hand would push, and the bottom hand would pull; this gave extra leverage thus the sword would be easier to swing, ignoring much of its weight. Claymore The Scottish name \\"claymore\\" (, lit. \\"large/great sword\\") can refer to either the longsword with a distinctive two-handed grip, or the basket-hilted sword developing from a rapier. The two handed claymore is an early Scottish version of a greatsword.  Zweih√§nder  The Zweih√§nder (\\"two-hander\\") or Beidh√§nder (\\"both-hander\\") is a true two-handed sword, in the sense that it cannot be wielded in only one hand. It was a specialist weapon wielded by certain Landsknechte (mercenary soldiers), so-called Doppels√∂ldners. Sv√§rdstav The swordstaff (sv√§rdstav) is a Scandinavian sword-polearm hybrid used in medieval times. It is made by placing a blade at the end of a staff, thus giving the same benefits of a sword with the reach of a spear or polearm. This helps the soldier fighting enemies both on foot and mounted. The length of the weapon makes it easier to fight mounted opponents, whilst the blade is still sufficient to be effective in close-quarters combat. This compares favourably to a spear which is ineffective at close range because only the tip can be used to attack, or a sword which lacks the reach to reliably wound mounted combatants. The greater length of the weapon could also help when fighting more heavily armed opponents, enabling the wielder to execute attacks with considerably more force. Classification by blade type =Double-edge and straight swords= These are double-edged, usually straight bladed swords, designed for optimized balance, reach and versatility. Jian Jian (; Cantonese: Gim) is a double-edged straight sword used during the last 2,500 years in China. The first Chinese sources that mention the jian date to the 7th century BC during the Spring and Autumn period;Ebrey 1999, p. 41 one of the earliest specimens being the Sword of Goujian. Historical one-handed versions have blades varying from in length. The weight of an average sword of blade-length would be in a range of approximately 700 to 900 grams (1.5 to 2 pounds).Rodell 2003, p. 19 There are also larger two-handed versions used by ancient and medieval armies and for training by many styles of Chinese martial arts. Two handed jians from the time of the Chu (state) and Han Dynasty were up to ~58 inches long. Longsword These days, the term longsword most frequently refers to a late Medieval and Renaissance weapon designed for use with two hands. The German langes Schwert (\\"long sword\\") in 15th-century manuals did not necessarily denote a type of weapon, but the technique of fencing with both hands at the hilt. The French √©p√©e b√¢tarde and the English bastard sword originate in the 15th or 16th century, originally having the general sense of \\"irregular sword or sword of uncertain origin\\". Qui n'√©tait ni Fran√ßaise, ni Espagnole, ni proprement Lansquenette, mais plus longue que ces fortes √©p√©es. (\\"[a sword] which was neither French, nor Spanish, nor properly Landsknecht [German], but longer than any of these sturdy swords.\\") Esp√©e bastarde could also historically refer to a single-handed sword with a fairly long blade compared to other short swords. Joseph Swetnam states that the bastard sword is midway in length between an arming sword and a long sword, and Randall Cotgrave's definition seems to imply this, as well. The French √©p√©e de passot was also known as √©p√©e b√¢tarde (i.e., bastard sword) and also coustille √† croix (literally a cross-hilted blade). The term referred to a medieval single-handed sword optimized for thrusting. The √©p√©e de passot was the sidearm of the franc-archers (French or Breton bowmen of the 15th and 16th centuries). The term passot comes from the fact that these swords passed (passaient) the length of a \\"normal\\" short sword. The \\"Masters of Defence\\" competition organised by Henry VIII in July 1540 listed two hande sworde, bastard sworde, and longe sworde as separate items (as it should in Joseph Swetnam's context).Joseph Strutt The sports and pastimes of the people of England from the earliest period: including the rural and domestic recreations, May games, mummeries, pageants, processions and pompous spectacles, 1801, p. 211. Antiquarian usage in the 19th century established the use of \\"bastard sword\\" as referring unambiguously to these large swords.Oakeshott (1980). However, George Silver and Joseph Swetnam refer to them merely as two hande sworde. The term \\"hand-and-a-half sword\\" is modern (late 19th century). During the first half of the 20th century, the term \\"bastard sword\\" was used regularly to refer to this type of sword. The Elizabethan long sword (cf. George Silver and Joseph Swetnam) is a single- handed \\"cut-and-thrust\\" sword with a blade similar to the long rapier. \\"Let thy (long) Rapier or (long) Sword be foure foote at the least, and thy dagger two foote.\\" Historical terms (15th to 16th century) for this type of sword included the Italian spada longa (lunga) and French √©p√©e longue. The term longsword has also been used to refer to different kinds of sword depending on historical context: * Bidenh√§nder or two-hander, a late Renaissance sword of the 16th century Landsknechte, the longest sword of all; * the long \\"side sword\\" or \\"rapier\\" with a cutting edge (the Elizabethan long sword). Spatha The Spatha was a double-edged longsword used by the Romans. The idea for the Spatha came from the swords of ancient celts in Germany and Britain. It was longer than the gladius, and had more reach, so the Spatha was most popular with soldiers in the cavalry. The blade could range between 0.5 to 1 meter long while the handle was usually between 18 and 20cm. Broadsword * Claymore * Basket-hilted sword * Sabre The term broadsword was never used historically to describe the one-handed arming sword. The arming sword was wrongly labelled a broadsword by antiquarians as the medieval swords were similar in blade width to the military swords of the day (that were also sometimes labeled as broadswords) and broader than the dueling swords and ceremonial dress swords. Short sword Knives such as the seax and other blades of similar length ‚Äì between 1 and 2 feet (~ 30 cm and 60 cm) ‚Äì are sometimes construed as swords. This is especially the case for weapons from antiquity, made before the development of high quality steel that is necessary for longer swords, in particular: *Iron Age swords: **Seax, a tool and weapon, common in Northern Europe. **Gladius, an early ancient Roman blade **Xiphos, a double-edged, single-hand blade used by the ancient Greeks; *Certain Renaissance-era sidearms: **Baselard, a late medieval heavy dagger; **Cinquedea, a civilian long dagger; **Dirk, the Scottish long dagger (biodag); **Hanger or wood-knife, a type of hunting sword or infantry sabre; *Certain fascine knives: **Model 1832 Foot Artillery Sword, a blade of about 25 inches in length designed after the Roman gladius. Also known as a coupe- chou (literally a cabbage cutter) in France. Oversized two-handers used as parade swords or ceremonial weapons often exceeded the length and weight of practical weapons of war. =Edgeless and thrusting swords= The edgeless swords category comprises weapons which are related to or labelled as ‚Äúswords‚Äù but do not emphasise \\"hacking or slashing techniques\\" or have any \\"cutting edges\\" whatsoever. The majority of these elongated weapons were designed for agility, precision and rapid thrusting blows to exploit gaps in the enemy's defences; some are capable of piercing iron or steel armour. Basket-hilted sword The basket-hilted sword is a sword type of the early modern era characterised by a basket-shaped guard that protects the hand. The basket hilt is a development of the quillons added to swords' crossguards since the Late Middle Ages. In modern times, this variety of sword is also sometimes referred to as the broadsword. Xiphos The Spartiatƒìs were always armed with a xiphos as a secondary weapon. Among most Greek warriors, this weapon had an iron blade of about 60 centimetres. The Spartan version was typically only 30-45 centimetres. The Spartan's shorter weapon proved deadly in the crush caused by colliding phalanx formations ‚Äì it was capable of being thrust through gaps in the enemy's shield wall and armour, where there was no room for longer weapons. The groin and throat were among the favourite targets. In one account, an Athenian asked a Spartan why his sword was so short and after a short pause he replied, \\"It's long enough to reach your heart.\\" Rapier The term \\"rapier\\" appeared in the English lexicon via the French √©p√©e rapi√®re which either compared the weapon to a rasp or file; it may be a corruption of \\"rasping sword\\" which referred to the sound the blade makes when it comes into contact with another blade. There is no historical Italian equivalent to the English word \\"rapier\\". Panzerstecher and koncerz The Panzerstecher is a German and East European weapon with a long, edgeless blade of square or triangular cross-section for penetrating armour. Early models were either two-handers or ‚Äúhand-and-half‚Äù hilted, while later 16th and 17th century models (also known as koncerz) were one-handed and used by cavalry. Tuck and verdun The \\"tuck\\" (French estoc, Italian stocco) is an edgeless blade of square or triangular cross-section used for thrusting. In French, estoc also means thrust or point; and estoc et taille means cut and thrust. The tuck may also get its name from the verb \\"to tuck\\" which means \\"to shorten\\". Small-sword The small sword or smallsword (also court sword, fr: √©p√©e de cour or dress sword) is a light one-handed sword designed for thrusting which evolved out of the longer and heavier rapier of the late Renaissance. The height of the small sword's popularity was between the mid-17th and late 18th century. It is thought to have appeared in France and spread quickly across the rest of Europe. The small sword was the immediate predecessor of the √âp√©e de Combat from which the √âp√©e developed Evangelista, Nick. The Encyclopedia of the Sword. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1995. p. 208 and its method of use‚Äîas typified in the works of such authors as Sieur de Liancour, Domenico Angelo, Monsieur J. Olivier, and Monsieur L'Abbat‚Äîdeveloped into the techniques of the French classical school of fencing. Small swords were also used as status symbols and fashion accessories; for most of the 18th century anyone, civilian or military, with pretensions to gentlemanly status would have worn a small sword on a daily basis. =Single-edge and curved swords= These are single-edged, usually thick or curved bladed swords, typically designed for slashing, chopping, severing limbs, tripping or broad sweeping techniques. Swordsmen were trained to use the dulled-side for defensive and blocking techniques. Backsword The backsword was a single-edged, straight-bladed sword, typically for military use. This type of sword had a thickened back to the blade (opposite the cutting edge), which gave the blade strength. The backsword blade was cheaper to manufacture than a two-edged blade. This type of sword was first developed in Europe in the 15th century and reflected the emergence of asymmetric guards, which made a two-edged blade somewhat redundant. The backsword reached its greatest use in the 17th and 18th century when many cavalry swords, such as the British 1796 Heavy Cavalry Sword, were of this form. Dao Dao are single-edged Chinese swords, primarily used for slashing and chopping. The most common form is also known as the , although those with wider blades are sometimes referred to as . In China, the dao is considered one of the four traditional weapons, along with the gun (stick or staff), qiang (spear), and the jian (sword). It is considered \\"The General of All Weapons\\".  Hook-Sword  The hook-sword, twin-hooks, fu- tao or shuang-gou () also known as hu-tou-gou (tiger-head-hook) is a Chinese weapon traditionally associated with northern styles of Chinese martial arts and Wushu weapons routines, but now often practiced by southern styles as well. Kopis Unlike the xiphos, which is a thrusting weapon, the kopis was a hacking weapon in the form of a thick, curved single edged iron sword. In Athenian art, Spartan hoplites were often depicted using a kopis instead of the xiphos, as the kopis was seen as a quintessential \\"villain\\" weapon in Greek eyes. Katana Historically, were one of the traditionally made that were used by the samurai of feudal Japan. Modern versions of the katana are sometimes made using non-traditional materials and methods. The katana is characterized by its distinctive appearance: a curved, slender, single-edged blade usually with a round guard and long grip to accommodate two hands. Hanger The hanger (Obs. whinyard, whinger, cuttoe), wood-knife or hunting sword is a long knife or short sword that hangs from the belt and was popular as both a hunting tool and weapon of war. Falchion and cutlass The falchion (French braquemart, Spanish bracamarte) proper is a wide straight-bladed but curved edged hanger or long knife. The term falchion may also refer to the early cutlass. The cutlass or curtal-axe also known as a falchion (French badelaire, braquemart, coutelas, malchus Italian coltellaccio, storta, German messer, dussack, malchus) is a broad-bladed curved hanger or long knife. In later usage, the cutlass referred to the short naval boarding sabre. Sabre The sabre (US saber) or shable (French sabre, Spanish sable, Italian sciabola, German S√§bel, Russian sablya, Hungarian szablya, Polish szabla, Ukrainian shablya) is a single-edged curved bladed cavalry sword. Scimitar The scimitar (French cimeterre, Italian scimitarra) is a type of saber that came to refer in general to any sabre used by the Turks or Ottomans (kilij), Persians (shamshir) and more specifically the Stradioti (Albanian and Greek mercenaries who fought in the French-Italian Wars and were employed throughout Western Europe). The scimitar proper was the Stradioti saber, and the term was introduced into France by Philippe de Commines (1447 ‚Äì 18 October 1511) as cimeterre, Italy (especially the Venetian Republic who hired the stradioti as mercenaries) as scimitarra, and England as cimeter or scimitar via the French and Italian terms.

Related to cattle, goats, and antelopes, the species was described following a discovery of remains in 1992 in V≈© Quang Nature Reserve by a joint survey of the Vietnamese Ministry of Forestry and the World Wide Fund for Nature. Saolas have since been kept in captivity multiple times, although only for short periods. A living saola in the wild was first photographed in 1999 by a camera trap set by WWF and the Vietnamese government's Forest Protection Department (SFNC). \\"Saola sighting in Vietnam raises hopes for rare mammal's recovery: Long-horned ox photographed in forest in central Vietnam, 15 years after last sighting of threatened species in wild\\", The Guardian, (November 13 2013).\\"Saola Rediscovered: Rare Photos of Elusive Species from Vietnam\\", World Wildlife Federation (February 13 2013). Taxonomy Some of the first known remains of this species, Zoological Museum of Copenhagen In May 1992, the Ministry of Forestry, Vietnam sent a survey team to examine the biodiversity of the newly established Vu Quang National Park. On this team were Do Tuoc, Le Van Cham and Vu Van Dung (of the Forest Inventory and Planning Institute); Nguyen Van Sang (of the Institute of Ecological and Biological Resources); Nguyen Thai Tu (of Vinh University); and John MacKinnon (of the World Wildlife Fund). On 21 May, the team procured a skull featuring a pair of strange, long and pointed horns from a local hunter. They came across a similar pair in the Annamite Range in the northeastern region of the reserve the following day. The team ascribed these features to a new bovid species, calling it the \\"saola\\" or the \\"Vu Quang ox\\" to avoid confusion with the sympatric serow. The WWF officially announced the discovery of the new species on 17 July 1992. According to biodiversity specialist Tony Whitten, though Vietnam boasts a variety of flora and fauna, many of which have been recently described, the discovery of as large an animal as the saola was quite unexpected. The saola was the first large mammal to be discovered in the area for 50 years. Observations of live saola have been few and far between, restricted to the Annamite Range. The scientific name of the saola is Pseudoryx nghetinhensis. It is the sole member of the genus Pseudoryx and is classified under the family Bovidae. The species was first described in 1993 by Vu Van Dung, Do Tuoc, biologists Pham Mong Giao and Nguyen Ngoc Chinh, Peter Arctander of the University of Copenhagen and John MacKinnon. The discovery of saola remains in 1992 generated huge scientific interest due to the animal's special physical traits. The saola differs significantly from all other bovid genera in appearance and morphology, enough to place it in its own genus (Pseudoryx). A recent sequencing study of ribosomal mitochondrial DNA of a large taxon sample divides the bovid family into two major subfamilial clades. The first clade is the subfamily Bovinae consisting of three tribes: Bovini (cattle and buffaloes), Tragelaphini (Strepsicerotini) (African spiral- horned bovids) and Boselaphini (nilgai and four-horned antelope). The second clade is the subfamily Antelopinae, which includes all other bovids. Antelopinae is composed of the three tribes: Caprini (goats, sheep, and muskox), Hippotragini (horse-like antelopes), and Antilopini (gazelles). Since its physical traits are so complex to classify, Pseudoryx had been classified variously as member of the subfamily Caprinae and as belonging to any of the three tribes of the subfamily Bovinae: Boselaphini, Bovini and Tragelaphini. DNA analysis has led scientists to place the saola as a member of the tribe Bovini. The morphology of its horns, teeth and some other features indicate it should be grouped with less-derived or more ancestral bovids. Scientific consensus may lead to classifying the saola as the sole member of a proposed new tribe Pseudorygini. =Etymology= The name 'saola' has been translated as \\"spindle[-horned]\\", although the precise meaning is actually \\"spinning- wheel post horn\\". The name comes from a Tai language of Vietnam. The meaning is the same in Lao language (‡ªÄ‡∫™‡∫ª‡∫≤‡∫´‡∫•‡∫≤, also spelled ‡ªÄ‡∫™‡∫ª‡∫≤‡∫´‡∫º‡∫≤ /s«éo-l«éÀê/ in Lao). The specific name nghetinhensis refers to the two Vietnamese provinces of Ngh·ªá An and H√† Tƒ©nh, while Pseudoryx acknowledges the animal's similarities with the Arabian or African oryx. Hmong people in Laos refer to the animal as saht- supahp, a term derived from Lao (‡∫™‡∫±‡∫î‡∫™‡∫∏‡∫û‡∫≤‡∫ö /s√†t sup ∞√°Àêp/) meaning \\"the polite animal\\", because it moves quietly through the forest. Other names used by minority groups in the Saola's range are lagiang (Van Kieu), a ngao (Ta Oi) and xoong xor (Katu) In the press, saolas have been referred to as \\"Asian unicorns\\", an appellation apparently due to its rarity and reported gentle nature, and perhaps because both the saola and the oryx have been linked with the unicorn. No known link exists with the Western unicorn myth or the \\"Chinese unicorn\\", the qilin. Description Horns in the University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum In a 1998 publication, William G. Robichaud, the coordinator of the Saola Working Group, recorded physical measurements for a captive female saola he dubbed 'Martha', in a Laotian menagerie. The animal was observed for around 15 days, until she died from unknown causes. Robichaud noted the height of the female as at the shoulder; the back was slightly elevated, nearly taller than the shoulder height. The head-and-body length was recorded as . The general characteristics of the saola, as shown by studies during 1993‚Äì5 as well as the 1998 study, include a chocolate brown coat with patches of white on the face, throat and the sides of the neck, a paler shade of brown on the neck and the belly, a black dorsal stripe, a pair of nearly parallel horns (present on both sexes). Robichaud noted that the hair, straight and long, was soft and thin‚Äìa feature unusual for an animal that is associated with montane habitats in at least a few parts of its range. While the hair was found to be short on the head and the neck, it thickened to woolly hair on the insides of the forelegs and the belly. Studies before 1998 reported a hint of red in the inspected skins. The neck and the belly are a paler shade of brown compared to the rest of the body. A common observation in all the three aforementioned studies is a thick stripe extending from the shoulders to the tail along the middle of the back. From the tip to the end, the tail, that measured in Robichaud's specimen, is trifurcated into continuous, horizontal bands of black, white and brown. Saola skin is thick over most of the body, but thickens to near the nape of the neck and at the upper shoulders. This adaptation is thought to protect against both predators and rivals' horns during fights. Skull fragments, also in the University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum The saola has round pupils with dark-brown irises that appear orange when light is shone into them; a cluster of white whiskers about long with a presumably tactile function protrude from the end of the chin. The specimen Robichaud observed could extend its tongue up to and reach its eyes and upper parts of the face; the upper surface of the tongue is covered with fine, backward-pointing barbs. Robichaud observed that either of the two maxillary glands (sinuses) had a nearly rectangular hollow with the dimensions , covered by a thick flap. The maxillary glands of the saola are probably the largest among those of all other animals. The glands are covered by a thick, pungent, grayish green, semi-solid secretion beneath which lies a sheath of few flat hairs. Robichaud observed several pores, used probably for secretion, on the upper surface of the lid. Each white facial spot shelters one or more nodules from which originate long white or black hairs. These secretions are typically rubbed against the underside of vegetation, leaving a musky, pungent paste. The spoor of the forelegs measured long by wide, and long by for the hindlegs. Both sexes possess slightly divergent horns that are similar in appearance and form almost the same angle with the skull, but differ in their lengths. Horns resemble the parallel wooden posts locally used to support a spinning wheel (thus the familiar name \\"spindlehorn\\"). These are generally dark-brown or black and about 35‚Äì50 cm long; twice the length of their head. Studies in 1993 and 1995 gave the maximum distance between the horn tips of wild specimens as , but the female observed by Robichaud showed a divergence of between the tips. Robichaud noted that the horns were apart at the base. While studies prior to Robichaud's claim the horns are uniformly circular in cross-section, Robichaud observed his specimen had horns with a nearly oval cross-section. The sides of the base of the horns is rugged and indented. Habitat and distribution Saola inhabit wet evergreen or deciduous forests in eastern Indochina, preferring rivers and valleys. Sightings have been reported from steep river valleys at 300‚Äì1800 m above sea level. In Vietnam and Laos, their range appears to cover approximately 5000 km2, including four nature reserves. During the winters, Saola tend to migrate down to the lowlands. Ecology and behaviour Hooves in the University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum Local people reported that the saola is active in the day as well as at night, but prefers resting during the hot midday hours. Robichaud noted that the captive female was active mainly during the day, but pointed out that the observation could have been influenced by the unfamiliar surroundings the animal found herself in. When she rested, she would draw her forelegs inward to her belly, extend her neck so that her chin touched the ground, and close her eyes. Though apparently solitary, saola have been reported in groups of two or three as well as up to six or seven. Grouping patterns of the saola resemble those of the bushbuck, anoa, and sitatunga. Robichaud observed that the captive female was calm in the presence of humans, but was afraid of dogs. On an encounter with a dog, she would resort to snorting and thrust her head forward, pointing her horns at her opponent. Her erect ears pointed backward, and she stood stiffly with her back arched. Meanwhile, she hardly paid any attention to her surroundings. This female was found to urinate and defecate separately, dropping her hind legs and lowering her lower body ‚Äì a common observation among bovids. She would spend considerable time grooming herself with her strong tongue. Marking behaviour in the female involved opening up the flap of the maxillary gland and leaving a pungent secretion on rocks and vegetation. She would give out short bleats occasionally. =Diet= Robichaud offered spleenwort (Asplenium) fern species, broad dark-green plants of the genus Homalomena, and various species of broad-leaved shrubs or trees of the subfamily Sterculiaceae to the captive animal. The saola fed on all plants, and showed a preference for the Sterculiaceae species. She did not pull at leaves, she would rather chew or pull them into her mouth using her long tongue. She fed mainly during the day, and rarely in the dark. The saola is also reputed to feed on Schismatoglottis, unlike other herbivores in its range. =Reproduction= Very little information is available about the reproductive cycle of the saola. The saola is likely to have a fixed mating season, from late August to mid-November; only single calf births have been documented, mainly during summer between mid-April and late June. In the absence of more specific data, the gestation period has been estimated as similar to that of Tragelaphus species, about 33 weeks. Three reports of saola killings from nearby villagers involved young accompanying mothers. One possessed long horns, another an estimated , and the third ; these varying horn lengths suggest a birth season extending over at least two to three months. Conservation The saola is currently considered to be critically endangered. Its restrictive habitat requirements and aversion to human proximity are likely to endanger it through habitat loss and habitat fragmentation. Saola suffer losses through local hunting and the illegal trade in furs, traditional medicines, and for use of the meat in restaurants and food markets.\\"Saola  Species  WWF.\\" WWF - Endangered Species Conservation World Wide Fund for Nature. N.p., n.d. Web. 24 April 2013 They also sometimes get caught in snares that have been set to catch animals raiding crops, such as wild boar, sambar, and muntjac. More than 26,651 snares have so far been removed from Saola habitats by conservation groups.\\" Home - Saola Working Group .\\" N.p., n.d. Web. 18 April 2013 The key feature of the area occupied by the saola is its remoteness from human disturbance. Saola are shot for their meat, but hunters also gain high esteem in the village for the production of a carcass. Due to the scarcity, the locals place much more value on the saola than more common species. Because the people in this area are traditional hunters, their attitude about killing the saola is hard to change; this makes conservation difficult. The intense interest from the scientific community has actually motivated hunters to capture live specimens. Commercial logging has been stopped in the nature reserve area of Bu Huong, and there is an official ban on forest clearance within the boundaries of the reserve. Species of conservation concern are frequently hard to study; there are often delays in implementing or identifying necessary conservation needs due to lack of data. Because the species is so rare, there is a continuous lack of adequate data; this is one of the major problems facing saola conservation. Trained scientists have never observed saola in the wild. Unfortunately, because it is unlikely that intact saola populations exist, field surveys to discover these populations are not a conservation priority. The Saola Working Group was formed by the IUCN Species Survival Commission's Asian Wild Cattle Specialist Group, in 2006 to protect the saolas and their habitat. This coalition includes about 40 experts from the forestry departments of Laos and Vietnam, Vietnam's Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources, Vinh University, biologists and conservationists from Wildlife Conservation Society, and the World Wide Fund for Nature. A group of scientists from the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology in central Hanoi, within the Institute of Biotechnology, investigated a last resort effort of conserving the species by cloning, an extremely difficult approach even in the case of well-understood species. However, the lack of female saola donors (of enucleated ovocytes), receptive females, as well as the interspecific barriers, greatly compromise the success of the cloning technique.

Background When elected pope in 1503, Pope Julius II promised under oath to convoke a general council, but his promise was not fulfilled. The Republic of Venice had encroached on papal rights in Venetian territories by independently filling vacant episcopal sees, subjecting clergy to secular tribunals and generally disregarding the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Julius II in other ways. In 1509, Julius II joined the League of Cambrai, a coalition formed to restore lands that had been recently conquered by Venice to their original owners. Julius II censured Venice with an interdict and deployed the armies of the Papal States, along with the combined forces of the League of Cambrai, to Venetian-occupied Romagna. There, Venice suffered a complete defeat at the Battle of Agnadello, on 14 May 1509. In 1510, Venice negotiated with Julius II, who withdrew from the League of Cambrai and removed the censure in exchange for terms that included Venice agreeing to return disputed towns in Romagna, to renounce claims to fill vacant benefices, to acknowledge jurisdiction of ecclesiastical tribunals over clergy and their immunity to secular tribunals including exemption from taxes, to revoke all unauthorised treaties made with towns in the Papal States, to abandon appeal to a future general council against the papal bans and to concede free navigation of the Adriatic Sea to Papal States subjects. The first stages of conflict between the Papal States and France began in 1510. King Louis XII of France demanded for the Republic of Florence to declare definitively its allegiance. However, declaring allegiance to France would expose Florence to an immediate attack, and alienate its citizens, who dreaded a conflict with the head of the Church. Additionally, Florence was full of antagonistic parties and irreconcilable interests. To gain time, Florence sent Niccol√≤ Machiavelli on a diplomatic mission to France in July 1510, where he found Louis XII eager for war and inclined towards the idea of a general council to depose Julius II. Julius II was a soldier, and his goal was to free the entire Italian Peninsula from subjection to foreign powers. However, only Venice and the Old Swiss Confederacy were ready to field armies against the French. Julius II began hostilities by deposing and excommunicating his vassal, Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, who supported France. Louis XII retaliated in September 1510 by convoking a synod of French bishops at Tours, which judged that the pope had no right to make war upon a foreign prince and if the pope undertook such a war, the foreign prince had the right to invade the Papal States and to withdraw his subjects' obedience to the pope. The synod also threatened Julius II with a general council. Julius II ignored the French synod and again assumed personal command of the army in Northern Italy. In August 1510, at Bologna, he became dangerously ill but then recovered. In October, he negotiated an anti-French alliance. In the beginning, the alliance included only the Papal States, Venice and Spain, but in November, England joined and was soon followed by the emperor and by Switzerland. The Papal States marched against Mirandola, which was captured on 20 January 1511. On 23 May 1511, contingents of the French army captured Bologna from the papal troops and reinstated Annibale II Bentivoglio. Under the leadership of Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours, the French were at first successful, but after his death, they yielded to the superior forces of the League. After being defeated in the Battle of Ravenna in 1512, they retreated beyond the Alps. Bologna again submitted to Julius II, and the cities of Parma, Reggio and Piacenza became part of the Papal States. ' of Pisa The reforms of the Council of Constance (1414‚Äì1418) and the Council of Basel- Ferrara-Florence (1431‚Äì1449) failed. At the Synods of Orleans and Tours, in 1510, the French decided to convoke a general council. In view of the Council of Constance decree ' and the delay of Julius II to convoke a general council as he had sworn in the papal conclave, the schismatic ' convened at Pisa in 1511. Florence permitted the ' to use Pisa as the location; this estranged Julius II, and both Florence and Pisa were placed under an interdict. According to Marco Pellegrini, the Gallican ' \\"shows how some members of the Sacred College were ever open to schismatic solutions\\". According to Kraus, it was intended by French politicians to restrain Julius II, and to recognise by general council of the principles of the 1438 Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges, drawn from the articles of the Council of Constance and the Council of Basel- Ferrara-Florence. The schismatic ' at Pisa was attended by only a few prelates including Cardinals Bernardino L√≥pez de Carvajal, Guillaume Bri√ßonnet, Francesco Borgia, Federico Sanseverino, and Ren√© de Prie. They were encouraged by Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, and Louis XII. According to Shahan, dissatisfaction with treatment by Julius II, as well as subserviency to the excommunicate Louis XII, led Carvajal to that rebellious attitude. Maximilian I, who had planned since 1507 to procure his own election to the papacy after Julius died, at first gave his protection to the schismatic ' at Pisa. Then, he withdrew it, and the German bishops also refused to have anything to do with the schismatic tendencies of the French. On 18 July 1511, Julius II summoned a general council, the Fifth Lateran Council, at Rome; it assembled there on 19 April 1512, with a very small attendance that had only Italian prelates. Julius deprived the four leading schismatic cardinals of their dignities, deposed them from their offices and excommunicated the ' participants. After the ' transferred from Pisa to Milan because of popular opposition, possibly elected Carvajal as Antipope Martin VI. Soon afterward, in 1512, fearing the Swiss mercenaries invasion of the French occupied Duchy of Milan, the ' participants departed to Lyon, France, where they abandoned the ' later that year. The schismatic ' was a political step aimed at Julius II, who was involved in conflict with the Duchy of Ferrara and France. The whole matter was a futile attempt to revive 15th century conciliarism and to use it for political purposes. Convocation of Lateran Council Pope Julius II, Bulla monitorii et declarationis, 1511 Julius II was quick to oppose the ' and convoked a general council by a papal bull of 18 July 1511, which was to meet on 19 April 1512 in the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, in Rome. The bull not only was a canonical document but also was polemical in content. Julius refuted the allegation by the cardinals for their Pisa '. He declared that his promise before his election as pope was sincere; that since he became pope, he had always sought to call a general council; that to prepare the general council, he had endeavoured to bring an end to quarrels between rulers; that subsequent wars had made calling the council inopportune. Julius then reproached the participants at Pisa for their lack of respect by calling a council without the pope, who was supposed to lead. He also said that the three months of preparation for Pisa was not enough. Finally, he declared that no one should attach any significance to the statements made at Pisa. A war of polemics was waged about the councils, pitting Thomas Cajetan, the Dominican Master General, on the papal side against the conciliarist arguments of Jacques Almain, the spokesman of the University of Paris. At the seventh session, in 1513, Carvajal and Sanseverino separated from their French colleagues and formally renounced the schism, and they were restored by Leo X to their offices. Alessandro Geraldini, the first Archbishop of Santo Domingo, attended the eleventh session, likely making him to first prelate from the Western Hemisphere to attend an Ecumenical Council.Hefele, Hergenroether, and Leclercq.

The scholar Egidio da Viterbo gave an inspiring opening address.Oratio prima Synodi Lateranensis habita, printed at Rome, 1513; it is printed in Harduin's collection of the Councils, Vol. IX, p.1576. Participants included fifteen cardinals, the Latin patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch, ten archbishops, fifty-six bishops, some abbots and generals of religious orders, the ambassadors of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor and those of Venice and of Florence. After Julius II died, his successor, Pope Leo X, continued the council, and the last session was held on 16 March 1517. During the council, the ambassador of the Holy Roman Emperor announced that Maximilian had rejected the decisions made by the ' at Pisa, and a similar announcement was made by Louis XII's ambassador. Several decrees were published, including: *A rejection and condemnation of the ' of Pisa, quashing everything done by it. * A confirmation of the excommunications of cardinals by Julius II (1512). * Inter multiplices, a Bull promulgated by Leo X on 4 May 1515, sanctioning the ': financial institutions under strict ecclesiastical supervision, which provided loans to the needy in the manner of pawn shops and had attracted both support and opposition from within the church since their establishment in the previous century; * Apostolici regiminis, on the immortality of the soul, usually believed to have been directed against Pietro Pomponazzi * One concerning the freedom of the Church and the dignity of bishops. * A requirement that a local bishop give permission before the printing of a new book. * Confirmation of the contemporaneous 1516 Concordat of Bologna between the Holy See and the Kingdom of France and abrogation of the 1438 Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges. * Advocation of war against the Turks to reclaim the Holy Land, to be funded by three years of tax levies. *Condemnation of all propositions contradicting \\"the truth of the enlightened Christian faith\\", restrictions on clergy teachings about the \\"nature of the rational soul\\" and regulation of university course sequences for clerics' studies in philosophy and poetry. A call to all philosophy teachers to complement any lesson that contradicts the Christian faith with \\"convincing arguments\\" from the Christian point of view. *Requirement for documented competence in preaching. Little was done to put the work of the council into practice. Whether or not the Protestant Reformation could have been avoided if the reforms had been implemented is a matter of debate. Martin Luther's 95 theses were published just seven months after the close of the Council. Notes References Sources   Introduction and translation taken from  * Minnich, Nelson H.

He discovered the amino acid threonine, and his research determined the necessity for essential amino acids in diet and the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth. Early life William Cumming Rose was born in Greenville, South Carolina. He attended various local schools, but his father John M. Rose, who was a Presbyterian minister, began to homeschool William in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew when he was 14 years old. He also studied an introductory chemistry textbook by Ira Remsen. When he was 16, he studied at Davidson College in North Carolina for his bachelor's degree. He took up graduate education at Yale University studying food chemistry with Russell Chittenden and Lafayette Mendel. He was granted a Ph.D. in 1911.Thesis: Studies in intermediate metabolism; mucic acid and carbohydrate metabolism; the physiology of cratine and cratinine elimination, their relation to carbohydrate metabolism Career Rose taught for a time at University of Pennsylvania with Alonzo Taylor. Taylor recommended him to University of Texas Galveston Medical School to organize a department of biochemistry. In 1922, he went to the University of Illinois as professor of physiological chemistry, a title which was changed to professor of biochemistry in 1936. From 1922 to 1955 he transformed his department into a center of excellence for the training of biochemists. At Illinois, Rose focused his research work on amino acid metabolism and nutrition. He found that the 19 amino acids then known were not sufficient for growth, and this led to his discovery in 1935 of the last of the common amino acids, Œ±-amino-Œ≤-hydroxy-n-butyric acid, later named threonine. His studies also distinguished the amino acids that are absolutely essential from those that are necessary only for optimal growth. His studies further led him to the point where it was \\"practicable to evaluate proteins in terms of their ability to meet human needs.\\" In June 1949 he published \\"Amino Acid Requirements of Man\\".Classic reprint: Nutrition Reviews 34(10):307‚Äì9 Rose served as President of the American Society of Biological Chemists from 1939 to 1941.

It is not to be confused with another Coombe Hill on the flank of Haddington Hill, some to the north-east. It is part of the Bacombe and Coombe Hills Site of Special Scientific Interest. The majority of the hill (an area of ) once formed part of the Chequers Estate but was presented to the National Trust by the United Kingdom government when they were given the Estate in the 1920s. The summit of the hill is above sea level. Coombe Hill Monument - Second Boer War  For most of human history, war memorials were erected to commemorate great victories; remembering the dead was a secondary concern. Coombe Hill Monument is one of the first and largest examples of a war memorial erected to honour the names of individual men who fell whilst fighting for their country. The monument is an iconic Buckinghamshire landmark and a Grade II Listed monument. At above sea level, it sits on one of the highest and most striking spurs of the Chilterns, commanding a wide view of the Vale of Aylesbury. On a clear day it can be seen from the Berkshire Downs and the Cotswolds to the west. The view overlooks Chequers, the country home of the Prime Minister. The monument was erected in 1904, by public subscription, in memory of 148 men from Buckinghamshire who died during the Second Boer War. Coombe Hill Monument was almost totally destroyed by lightning in 1938 and was rebuilt in the same year. The original bronze plaque and decorations were stolen in 1972 and replaced with a stone plaque and iron flag. The new stone plaque was also inscribed with the additional names of nine men believed to have been missing on the original. The monument was again badly damaged by a lightning strike in the early 1990s and spent several months in repair. It is now equipped with conductors to prevent this from happening again. The monument and a few square metres of surrounding land are owned by Buckinghamshire County Council. The 2010 Restoration On 21 October 2010, the monument was rededicated after substantial restoration work. The work was done by Buckinghamshire County Council with funds raised by the Coombe Hill Monument Appeal Committee. The committee consisted of: The Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire, Sir Henry Aubrey Fletcher Bt JP (Patron); Major General Stuart Watson CBE (Chairman); Mark Bailey, Buckinghamshire County Council (Project Manager); Lt Col (Retd) Ingram Murray, Honorary Secretary of the Friends of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry; Patricia Birchley, Elected Member, Chiltern Ridges; Johanna Sienkiewicz, local resident, Project Researcher; Chris Arnold, Ellesborough Parish Council; Pam Priestley, Elected Member Wycombe District Council; Paul Rogerson, Elected Member, Buckinghamshire County Council; and Neil Harris, The National Trust A new plaque corrects spelling errors in the original and adds 2 names that were previously omitted. The memorial was deep- cleaned, weathered joints were replaced, fresh gold leaf has been applied to the finial, and the county crest and bronze flags above the plaque have been restored. Triangulation point and plaque In front of the monument is a rectangular concrete pillar that is the trig point and it is topped with a metal plaque donated in 1988 that points to true north and to the following distant features: The Cotswolds (), Brill Hill (13 miles), Waddesdon Manor (), Calvert Chimneys (), Aylesbury Church (), Mursley Water Tower (), Wingrave Church (), Leighton Buzzard (), Mentmore (), Edlesborough Church () and Ivinghoe Beacon (). The trig point was heavily damaged, bordering on being totally destroyed, by vandals in early October 2018. Flora and fauna Coombe Hill has 3 different types of land including acid heathland, chalk grassland and deciduous woodland. It is home to much interesting wildlife -- including red kites, yellowhammers and firecrests. It also holds the habitat to many rare plants such as heather, orchids and the Chiltern gentian. Due to its rarity the acid moorland is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Coombe Hill Run A running race organised by the Vale of Aylesbury Athletic Club which includes of climbing up to the monument on Coombe Hill, the Coombe Hill Run is a rare example of a fell race in southern Britain. First held in 1973, and now held on the first Sunday in June, it attracts more than 200 runners. Origin of name The word coombe is of Brythonic origin and means \\"hollow\\".

Originally released in IMAX theaters, it is now available on DVD, Blu-ray and HD DVD. Synopsis Chronos is 42 minutes long and has no actors or dialogue. The soundtrack consists of a single continuous piece by composer Michael Stearns. Filmed in dozens of locations on five continents, the film relates to the concept of time passing on different scales‚Äîthe bulk of the film covers the history of civilization, from pre- history to Egypt to Rome to Late Antiquity to the rise of Western Europe in the Middle Ages to the Renaissance to the modern era. It centers on European themes but not exclusively. Other time scales include the passing of seasons, and the passing of night and day, and the passing shadows of the sun in an afternoon to the passing of people on the street. These themes are intermingled with symbolic meaning. Background Chronos shares its particular style with the film Koyaanisqatsi (1983), for which Ron Fricke was the cinematographer, as well as his later films Sacred Site and Baraka (1992). The theme of the film is \\"the celebration of life\\", and does not include the themes of technology as the culprit for society or \\"life out of balance\\", which were present in Koyaanisqatsi. American Cinematographer described the film as \\"a musical poem praising the evolution of Western man from Cairo to Los Angeles.\\" The film was produced by Canticle Films, a production company founded by Fricke. Funding for Chronos came from the seed money acquired through the publicity surrounding the production of Koyaanisqatsi. Fricke designed and built a 65 mm camera for the film, which included a motion control system for the film's cinematography. The director also used the system in his later films. Michael Stearns, while composing the soundtrack for the film, used a custom-made instrument called \\"The Beam\\" to generate many of the sounds he required. The Beam was long, made of extruded aluminum with 24 piano strings of gauge 19-22. The name of the film comes from the Ancient Greek word œáœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ, kr√≤nos, which means time and is also the source to many modern terms related to time, such as chronology, synchronous etc. Awards * International OMNI-MAX Film Festival: \\"Grand Prize Winner\\" References External links * Category:IMAX short films Category:IMAX documentary films Category:American avant-garde and experimental films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Ron Fricke Category:1985 short films Category:Non- narrative films Category:Films scored by Michael Stearns Category:1980s avant- garde and experimental films Category:Films about time Category:American short films ","title":"Chronos (film)"},{"id":"922757","text":"Tragelaphus is a genus of medium- to large-sized spiral-horned antelopes. It contains several species of bovine, all of which are relatively antelope-like. Species in this genus tend to be large sized, lightly built, have long necks and considerable sexual dimorphism. Elands, including the common eland (Taurotragus oryx), are embedded within this genus meaning that Taurotragus must be subsumed into Tragelaphus to avoid paraphyly. Alternatively, Taurotragus could be maintained as a separate genus, if the nyala and the lesser kudu are relocated to their own monospecific genera: respectively, Nyala and Ammelaphus. Other generic synonyms include Strepsiceros (which applies to T. strepsiceros) and Boocercus (for T. eurycerus).Integrated Taxonomic Information System The name \\"Tragelaphus\\" comes from the mythical tragelaph. Taxonomy and phylogeny Tragelaphus is a genus in the tribe Tragelaphini and the family Bovidae. The genus authority is the French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, who first mentioned it in the journal Bulletin des Sciences, par la Soci√©t√© Philomatique in 1816. The name is composed of two Greek words: tragos, meaning a male goat; and elaphos, meaning deer. It is generally treated as eight species, namely:. *Bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus) *Greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) *Bushbuck (Tragelaphus sylvaticus) *K√©wel (Tragelaphus scriptus) *Lesser kudu (Tragelaphus imberbis) *Mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni) *Nyala (Tragelaphus angasii) *Sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekii) An alternative classification, supported by genetic data, would recognise 11 species in five groups which could be treated as subgenera or full genera: (i) Nyala for T. angasii; (ii) Ammelaphus for T. imberbis; (iii) Taurotragus for the two elands (T. oryx and T. derbianus); (iv) Strepsiceros for T. strepsiceros and (v) Tragelaphus restricted to T. buxtoni, T. spekei, T. scriptus, T. sylvaticus (Imbabala - separated from a polyphyletic T. scriptus) and T. eurycerus. In terms of divergence time estimates, a 2006 study showed that core Tragelaphus (now known to excude T. angasii and T. imberbis) diverged from Taurotragus (elands) towards the end of the Late Miocene.

Canals in orange, rivers in blue, streams in grey. The canals of the United Kingdom are a major part of the network of inland waterways in the United Kingdom. They have a colourful history, from use for irrigation and transport, through becoming the focus of the Industrial Revolution, to today's role of recreational boating. Despite a period of abandonment, today the canal system in the United Kingdom is again in increasing use, with abandoned and derelict canals being reopened, and the construction of some new routes. Most canals in England and Wales are maintained by the Canal & River Trust, previously British Waterways, but a minority of canals are privately owned. The majority of canals in the United Kingdom can accommodate boats with a length of between and are now used primarily for leisure. There are a number of canals which are far larger than this, including New Junction Canal and the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which can accommodate boats with a length of up to . One purpose-built ship canal in the United Kingdom, the Manchester Ship Canal, is incomparable to any other. Upon opening in 1894, it was the largest ship canal in the world, permitting ships with a length of up to to navigate its route. History of commercial carrying Traditional working canal boats Canals first saw use during the Roman occupation of the south of Great Britain and were used mainly for irrigation. The Romans also created several navigable canals, such as Foss Dyke, to link rivers, enabling increased transport inland by water. The United Kingdom's navigable water network grew as the demand for industrial transport increased. The canals were key to the pace of the Industrial Revolution: roads at the time were unsuitable for large volumes of traffic. A system of very large pack horse trains had developed, but few roads were suitable for wheeled vehicles able to transport large amounts of materials (especially fragile manufactured goods such as pottery) quickly. Canal boats were very much quicker, could carry large volumes, and were much safer for fragile items. Following the success of first the Sankey Canal followed by the Bridgewater Canal, other canals were constructed between industrial centres, cities and ports, and were soon transporting raw materials (particularly coal and lumber) and manufactured goods. There were immediate benefits to households, as well as to commerce: in Manchester, the cost of coal fell by 75% when the Bridgewater Canal arrived. The Manchester Ship Canal can accommodate ships with a length of up to . As the Industrial Revolution took hold in the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, the technology allowed canals to be improved. The early canals contoured round hills and valleys, later ones went straighter. Locks took canals up and down hills, and they strode across valleys on taller and longer aqueducts and through hills in longer and deeper tunnels. From the mid-19th century, railways began to replace canals, especially those built with the standard narrow () bridges and locks. As trains, and later road vehicles, became more advanced, they became cheaper than the narrow canal system, being faster, and able to carry much larger cargoes. The canal network declined, and many canals were bought by railway companies ‚Äì in some cases to enable them to penetrate rival companies' areas transhipping to/from canal boats. Some narrow canals became unusable, filled with weeds, silt and rubbish, or were converted to railways. '...gleaming brass and gaily-painted metalware....' Saul, Gloucestershire There was a late burst of wide-waterway building (e.g. the Caledonian Canal, and the Manchester Ship Canal), and of invention and innovation by people such as Bartholomew of the Aire and Calder company, who conceived the trains of nineteen coal-filled \\"Tom Pudding\\" compartment boats that were pulled along the Aire and Calder Navigation from the Yorkshire coalfields, then lifted bodily to upturn their contents directly into seagoing colliers at Goole Docks (their descendants, Hargreaves' tugs pushing three coal-pans trains to be upended into hoppers at the Aire power stations lasted as late as 2004). However, the last new canal before the end of the 20th century was the New Junction Canal in Yorkshire (now South Yorkshire) in 1905. As competition intensified, horse-drawn single narrowboats were replaced by steam and later diesel powered boats towing an unpowered butty, and many of the boatmen's families abandoned their shore homes for a life afloat, to help with boat handling and to reduce accommodation costs ‚Äì the birth of the legendary \\"boatman's cabin\\" with bright white lace, gleaming brass and gaily- painted metalware. Constant lowering of tolls meant that the carriage of some bulky, non-perishable, and non-vital goods by water was still feasible on some inland waterways ‚Äì but the death knell for commercial carrying on the narrow canals was sounded in the winter of 1962‚Äì63, when a long hard frost kept goods icebound on the canals for three months. A few of the remaining customers turned to road and rail haulage to ensure reliability of supply and never returned, though both rail and road had been severely disrupted by the frost and snow too. Other narrowboat traffic gradually ceased with the change from coal to oil, the closure of canalside factories, and run-down of British heavy industry. The last long-distance narrowboat traffics, coal from the Midlands to Dickinson's paper mills at Croxley and the Kearley & Tonge Jam Factory at Southall both ceased in 1970 ‚Äì the Croxley mills had changed to oil and the Jam Factory closed for re-location. Regular narrowboat traffics continued, such as lime juice from Brentford to Boxmoor (until 1981) while aggregates were carried on the River Soar until 1988. Some individual waterways (especially the Manchester Ship Canal, the Aire & Calder Navigation and the other large waterways) remain viable, carrying many millions of tonnes per year and there are still hopes for development, but containerisation of ports and lorries has mostly passed the waterways by. The last major investment development of the inland waterways was the enlargement of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation in the early 1980s to cope with barges of standard European dimensions that (in the depression of the 80s) never came. The scale of the futile hopes of those days can be appreciated by the occupants of a holiday narrowboat nearly lost in a lock built for the barges that were going to sail down the Rhine, across the North Sea aboard a ship, and up to Doncaster. Today there have been a number of successful initiatives to get more traffic on to the larger inland waterways, though even the Manchester Ship Canal does not convey cargo ships to the docks in Salford, which have become little more than a 'water feature' for the apartments, offices and cultural institutions of 'Salford Quays' that have replaced the wharves and warehouses. Growth of leisure use The Oxford Canal near Rugby In the latter half of the 20th century, while the use of canals for transporting goods was dying out, there was a rise in interest in their history and potential use for leisure. A large amount of credit for this is usually given to L. T. C. Rolt, whose book Narrow Boat about a journey made in the narrowboat Cressy was published in 1944. A key development was the foundation of the Inland Waterways Association, and the establishment of fledgling weekly boat-hire companies, following the example of such companies on the Norfolk Broads, which had long been used for leisure boating. The authority responsible for the canals, the British Waterways Board, encouraged this process from the late 1950s by operating a fleet of holiday hire boats, initially converted from cut-down working boats. Holidaymakers began renting 'narrowboats' and roaming the canals, visiting towns and villages they passed. Other people bought boats to use for weekend breaks and the occasional longer trip. The concept of a canal holiday became even more familiar when the large agencies that dealt with Broads holidays began to include canal boatyards in their brochures. Canal-based holidays became popular due to their relaxing nature, self-catering levels of cost, and variety of scenery available; from inner London to the Scottish Highlands. This growth in interest came just in time to give local canal societies the ammunition they needed to combat government proposals in the 1960s to close commercially unviable canals, and to resist pressure from local authorities and newspapers to \\"fill in this eyesore\\" or even to \\"close the killer canal\\" (when someone fell in one). It was not long before enthusiastic volunteers were repairing unnavigable but officially open canals and moving on to restore officially closed ones and demonstrating their renewed viability to the authorities. The Kennet and Avon Canal near the Dundas Aqueduct, Wiltshire Birmingham Canal Old Main Line in downtown Birmingham Local authorities began to see how a cleaned-up and well-used waterway was bringing visitors to other towns and waterside pubs ‚Äî not just boaters, but people who just like being near water and watching boats (see gongoozler). They began to clean up their own watersides, and to campaign for \\"their\\" canal to be restored. As a result of this growing revival of interest, for the first time in a century some new routes have been constructed (the Ribble Link and the Liverpool Canal Link), another is under construction (the Fens Waterways Link). Large projects such as the restoration of the Anderton Boat Lift, or the building of the Falkirk Wheel attracted development funding from the European Union and from the Millennium Fund. The Rochdale Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Droitwich Canals have all been restored to navigation since 2000. Present status There are now about of navigable canals and rivers throughout the United Kingdom. Most of them are linked into a single English and Welsh network from Bristol to London, Liverpool to Goole and Lancaster to Ripon, and connecting the Irish Sea, the North Sea, the estuaries of the Humber, Thames, Mersey, Severn and Ribble. This network is navigable in its entirety by a narrowboat (a boat wide) no longer than about . There are also several through-routes not connected to the main network, notably those in Scotland, e.g. Glasgow to Edinburgh via the Falkirk Wheel and Inverness to Fort William via Loch Ness. The aim of campaigning bodies such as the Inland Waterways Association is to persuade the Canal & River Trust (which owns about half of Britain's inland waterway network) to fully reopen all disused canals. In May 2005, it was reported that British Waterways (the predecessor to the Canal & River Trust) was hoping to quadruple the amount of cargo carried on Britain's canal network to six million tonnes by 2010 by transporting large amounts of waste to disposal facilities. The speed limit for the majority of inland waterways in the United Kingdom managed by the Canal & River Trust is . All speed measurements on Canal & River Trust waterways are expressed in terms of speed over the ground, rather than speed through the water. List of canals Canal features =Aqueducts= Pontcysyllte navigable aqueduct, Wrexham, Wales Canal aqueducts are structures that carry a canal across a valley, road, railway, or another canal. Dundas Aqueduct is built of stone in a classical style. Pontcysyllte Aqueduct is an iron trough on tall stone piers. Barton Swing Aqueduct opens to let ships pass underneath on the Manchester Ship Canal.

The distinguishing feature of a lock is a fixed chamber whose water-level can be changed. Where a large height difference has to be overcome, locks are built close together in a flight such as at Caen Hill Locks. Where the gradient is very steep, a set of staircase locks are sometimes used, like Bingley Five Rise Locks. At the other extreme stop locks have little or no change in level but were built to conserve water where one canal joined another. An interesting example is King's Norton Stop Lock which was built with guillotine gates.

The modern Italian form is Orazio, the modern Spanish form Horacio. It appears to have been first used in England in 1565, in the Tudor era during which the Italian Renaissance movement had started to influence English culture. History Horatio de Vere, 1st Baron Vere of Tilbury (1565-1635), an English military leader, was one of the earliest English holders of the name, born 34 years before Shakespeare invented the character Horatio in his 1599/1601 play Hamlet. He was a grandfather of Horatio Townshend, 1st Viscount Townshend (1630‚Äì1687), whose son Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend (a ward of Col. Robert Walpole (1650-1700) of Houghton Hall in Norfolk) married Dorothy Walpole, one of the latter's daughters and a sister of Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole (1678-1757) (and of Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford (1676-1745), the Prime Minister). The name Horatio was subsequently much used by the Walpole family and by the 1st Baron Walpole's illustrious younger cousin Admiral Horatio Nelson (1758-1805), his father's great-great grandson, born one year after 1st Baron Walpole's death. The 1st Baron Walpole's son, Horatio Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, 2nd Baron Walpole (1723-1809) served as a godfather at the christening of Admiral Horatio Nelson in 1758, who for that reason, as was common, was given his name.Pettigrew, Thomas, Memoirs of the Life of Vice- Admiral, Lord Viscount Nelson, K.

Background Following a meeting at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1900, the first Pan-Celtic Congress was held in Dublin in 1901, at that time it was proposed to make the Congress a triennial event.Lord Castletown. \\"Address to the Pan-Celtic Congress of 1907\\", Scotia, St. Andrew's society, 1907 In 1904 Cornwall became a member of the Pan-Celtic Congress. History The Celtic Congress was founded in 1917 by Edward John, a Welsh nationalist who was an MP for East Denbighshire from 1910 until 1918. He was motivated in part by the ideal of reviving the work of the earlier Celtic Association and its annual Pan-Celtic Congresses, but was also influenced by the social and culture aftermath of the First World War. The new Celtic Congress held its first meeting in 1917 at the Birkenhead Eisteddfod. The Congress was held in Edinburgh in 1920, and in 1921 on the Isle of Man. In 1925 the Congress was held in Dublin, where one of the speakers was Douglas Hyde. A prominent figure was Agnes O'Farrelly, who was also part of the Gaelic League and for a while was a member of Cumann na mBan. She played a major role in the organisation after John's death in 1931. In 1935, Cardiff was the venue, and BBC Western Region broadcast the proceedings. The 1938 Congress was held on Isle of Man in different halls, so that attendees had a choice of lectures, debates and discussions. Meetings were irregular before World War II although in the 1920s, the National Party of Scotland (the forerunner of the modern Scottish National Party) sought involvement, and the then Taoiseach of Ireland, √âamon de Valera consented to be a patron of the organisation in the 1930s. There had been an eleven-year gap before the August 1949 Celtic Congress at Bangor, Wales where delegates included Sir Ifor Williams and Conor Maguire, Chief Justice of Ireland.The Manchester Guardian CELTIC CONGRESS AT BANGOR: First for Eleven Years; 9 August 1949 Meetings have been held almost every year since then. The Celtic Congress of 1950, held at the Royal Institution of Cornwall in Truro, was a catalyst for the foundation of Mebyon Kernow the following year. The Wales branch hosted the meeting at Aberystwyth in 1960. Each of the six branches is independent with their own programmes of activities during the year. The Conference is held in each of the six countries in turn, and the country that is hosting the conference has the privilege of choosing the theme of the lectures for that year.

Schnitzler's play Schnitzler completed the play in 1900, but did not intend it to be performed, even calling the series of scenes 'unprintable', he intended them to be read by friends. The play was too sexually explicit to be performed at the time. Subsequently, it was read and then performed in private. Its first public performance in 1921, under the now accepted title Reigen, was closed down by the Vienna police‚ÄîSchnitzler was prosecuted for obscenity. Reigen was meant as a dramatic expose of the decadence of the Austrian society. Schnitzler, being a doctor approached the decadence of society from a medical point of view, studying the journey of Syphilis through all classes of society. The title Reigen would be best translated as 'round-dance' or 'roundelay'. This refers to the daisy chain of sexual encounters, which also determines the format of the play. It is divided into ten scenes and each scene holds two characters (always male and female) and their sexual encounter. The following scene contains one character of the previous scene and a new one. A has sex with B, B has sex with C and so on; until in the tenth scene the circle closes with J having sex with A.

The characters change accordingly, the soldier becomes a cab driver, the parlour maid becomes an au pair, etc... Hare's major difference from the original piece is the idea of performing it as a two-person show. Hare states himself that he was not the first person to do so. In 1981 when the theatrical rights fell temporarily out of copyright several stage versions were crafted and performed. Otherwise Hare's adaptation is not far from the original. Syphilis or any other sexually transmitted disease is never explicitly mentioned in either Schnitzler's original or Hare's adaptation. Scene VI contains the only reference to this when the politician is concerned about 'hygiene' having just slept with the model. Sam Mendes had asked Hare to adapt Schnitzler's Reigen. The 1950 movie La Ronde by Max Oph√ºls was also based on Reigen and has influenced many stage adaptations, including The Blue Room. =The characters= *The Girl (Irene) - Scene I & X *The Cab Driver (Fred) - Scene I & II *The Au Pair (Marie) - Scene II & III *The Student (Anton) - Scene III & IV *The Married Woman (Emma) - Scene IV & V *The Politician (Charles) - Scene V & VI *The Model (Kelly) - Scene VI & VII *The Playwright (Robert) - Scene VII & VIII *The Actress - Scene VIII & IX *The Aristocrat (Malcolm) - Scene IX & X =Performances= Hare's adaptation was first performed at the Donmar Warehouse, London, on 10 September 1998 with Nicole Kidman and Iain Glen in lead roles.

He was a director of the Botanical Garden of Vienna. Biography Endlicher studied theology and received minor orders. In 1828 he was appointed to the Austrian National Library to reorganize its manuscript collection. Concurrently he studied natural history, in particular botany, and East-Asian languages. In 1836, Endlicher was appointed keeper of the court cabinet of natural history, and in 1840 he became professor at the University of Vienna and director of its Botanical Garden. He wrote a comprehensive description of the plant kingdom according to a natural system, at the time its most comprehensive description. As proposed by Endlicher, it contained images with text. It was published together with the reissue of Franz Unger's Grundz√ºge der Botanik (Fundamentals of Botany). Endlicher was fundamental in establishing the Imperial Academy of Science (), but when contrary to his expectations the Baron Joseph Hammer von Purgstall was elected its president in his stead, he resigned. He presented his library and herbaria to the state, and passed several hours every week for 10 years in the society of the Emperor Ferdinand, but he received no other reward than the title of councillor (). As a known liberal, Endlicher was asked to act as mediator during the revolution of 1848, but eventually was forced to leave Vienna for a time. In 1848 he also became a member of the Frankfurt Parliament and the assembly at Kremsier (Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ). Works Endlicher made valuable contributions to the science of old German and classic literature, and pointed out new sources of Hungarian history, publishing Fragmenta Theotisca Versionis antiquissimae Evangelii Matthaei (edited with Hoffmann von Fallersleben, 1834), an edition of two poems of Priscian (1828), and Anonymi Bel√¶ Regis Notarii de Gestis Hungarorum Liber (1827). His linguistic publications comprise Analecta Grammatica (with Eichenfeld, 1836), and Anfangsgr√ºnde der chinesischen Grammatik (Foundations of Chinese grammar; 1845). His Verzeichniss der japanesischen und chinesischen M√ºnzen des kaiserlichen M√ºnz- und Antikencabinets (Catalog of Japanese and Chinese coins in the imperial coin and antique collections; 1837) and Atlas von China nach der Aufnahme der Jesuitenmission√§re (Atlas of China after the arrival of the Jesuit missionaries; 1843) are finely executed, and deserve mention as specimens of his great liberality. He wrote several works in conjunction with other scholars, and many of his minor writings are scattered among the periodicals of his time, especially in the Annalen des Wiener Museums. =Botany= The majority and the most valuable of his works are on botany. Foremost among them are his: Genera Plantarum (1831‚Äì1841), in which he lays down a new system of classification; Grundz√ºge einer neuen Theorie der Pflanzenerzeugung (Foundations of a new theory of plant breeding; 1838); and Die Medicinalpflanzen der √∂sterreichischen Pharmakop√∂e (Medicinal plants in the Austrian pharmacopoeia; 1842). His other principal botanical works are: Ceratotheca (1822), Flora Posoniensis (1830), Diesingia (1832), Atacta Botanica (1833), Iconographia Generum Plantarum (1838), Enchiridium Botanicum (1841) and Synopsis Coniferarum (1847). Endlicher established the botanical journal Annalen des Wiener Museums der Naturgeschichte (1835 and on). He began the work Flora Brasiliensis with Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius. He also published early works on the flora of Australia, including the plants collected by Carl von Hugel and Ferdinand Bauer. Endlicher described many new plant genera, including the genus Sequoia, and also its only extant species Sequoia sempervirens (California coast redwood). Calflora Database: Sequoia sempervirens (Coast redwood); (D. Don) Endl. Although Endlicher never offered an explanation for the name, later writers speculated that he must have been inspired by the achievements of the American Cherokee Indian linguist Sequoyah. John Davis credited Endlicher with naming the new species of Sierra redwood Sequoyah gigantea in 1847, the present day Sequoiadendron giganteum (California giant redwood), to honor Sequoyah's invention of the Cherokee syllabary.Davis, John B. Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 8, Number 2. \\"The Life and Work of Sequoyah.\\" June, 1930. Retrieved April 4, 2013. Calflora Database: Sequoiadendron giganteum (Giant redwood); (Lindley) J.Buchholz. Recent scholarship supports this hypothesis; Endlicher appears to have combined the Latin sequi (meaning to follow) with his admiration of Sequoyah and coined \\"Sequoia\\" because the number of seeds per cone in the newly-classified genus fell in mathematical sequence with the other four genera in the suborder. . The genus Endlicheria of the family Lauraceae was named in his honour.

Written by Jeffrey Shaara after his father Michael's death in 1988, the novel relates events from 1858 through 1863 during the American Civil War, ending just as the two armies march toward Gettysburg. Shaara also wrote The Last Full Measure, published in 2000, which follows the events presented in The Killer Angels. In 2003 Gods and Generals was made into a film directed by Ronald F. Maxwell and starring Robert Duvall and Jeff Daniels. The film shares most of its cast with Gettysburg, the film adaptation of The Killer Angels. Plot Copying his father's approach of focusing on the most important officers of the two armies (General Robert E. Lee, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, Lt. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, and Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Chamberlain), Shaara depicted the emotional drama of soldiers fighting old friends while accurately detailing historical details including troop movements, strategies, and tactical combat situations. General Hancock, for instance, spends much of the novel dreading the day he will have to fire on his friend in the Confederate Army, Lewis \\"Lo\\" Armistead. The novel also deals with General Lee's disillusionment with the Confederate bureaucracy and General Jackson's religious fervor. In addition to covering events leading up to the war, the book includes the battles of First Bull Run, covered only from the perspective of Robert E. Lee, who was in Richmond at the time and thus not at the battle, Williamsburg, Second Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. The film version provides only cursory coverage of immediate pre-war events, focusing primarily on Jackson and the secession of Virginia, and omits Antietam (included in the Director's Cut) along with Williamsburg and Second Bull Run. It spends a considerable amount of time on First Bull Run, which played only a minor role in the book. Awards In 1997, it received the W. Y. Boyd Literary Award for Excellence in Military Fiction from the American Library Association.http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/awards/2/all_years Boyd Award Recipients Other Media Gods and Generals is also the title of the second album recorded by Swedish power metal band Civil War.

Member of the Imperial Academy of Arts. Biography Born in St. Petersburg to the family of a sergeant in the Preobrazhensky Guards regiment, Martynov graduated from the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1788. In St. Petersburg Martynov studied landscape painting under Semion Shchedrin. From 1788 to 1794 he studied in Italy and painted the landscapes of Rome and its surroundings. These works for art were highly appreciated, by Martynov‚Äôs return to St. Petersburg. He was awarded the title of Academician in 1795. He worked on commissions from the Imperial court, and he participated in the decorating of several royal palaces and became a councilor of the Academy in 1802. He travelled throughout southern Russia from 1804, primarily creating idealized watercolour of rural towns and landscapes. The beauty of the area around Lake Baikal especially captivated him, ‚Äúit is surrounded by the Sayan Mountains, whose endless chain and picture-like diversity bring to the traveller‚Äôs gaze the infectious grandeur of nature‚Äù. His works of art is comparable to the present pair in its idealised panoramic vision of nature, with its vast expanses of water and sky. Like View of Irkutsk, Martynov‚Äôs Irkutsk, focuses more on the surrounding landscape than the city itself. These very Classical compositions are entirely devoted to the celebration of the beauty of nature. In 1805 he was the official artist of the Russian embassy to China by Earl A. Golovkin. Martynov moved gradually away from painting into the newer media of etching and lithography, which he is primarily known for, because of his lithographic techniques. His series of lithographs of the lands and peoples of Mongolia (entitled \\"Views of Russia and Mongolia\\" and \\"Peoples Types of Russia and Mongolia\\") were greatly admired. A later set of lithographs, made while touring the Baltic regions (\\"Views of the Baltic Countries\\"), was similarly lauded in 1810. Martynov died in Italy in 1826.

Played by Ian Marter, the character appears as a regular during the programme's twelfth season in 1974‚Äì1975. Character history Doctor Sullivan is a commissioned Surgeon-Lieutenant in the Royal Navy, who is attached as medical officer to the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, the military organisation to which the Doctor acts as scientific advisor. He is first mentioned (though not seen) in Planet of the Spiders, when the Brigadier thinks the Third Doctor has gone into a coma. The Brigadier calls \\"Doctor Sullivan\\" and asks him to come to the Doctor's laboratory, but tells him not to bother when Sergeant Benton wakes the Doctor by offering him a cup of coffee. In the next serial, Robot, after the Doctor's third regeneration, Sullivan is called in to attend him, and ends up travelling aboard the TARDIS with the Fourth Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith (played by Elisabeth Sladen) for several subsequent adventures. Harry is rather old-fashioned and stereotypically English in his attitudes. Somewhat accident-prone, he once claimed he was always trapping his nose in the doors of Portsmouth barracks. He often employs slightly archaic language ‚Äî for example, referring to Sarah Jane affectionately as \\"old thing\\" or \\"old girl\\". He is nonetheless depicted as possessing great bravery and a \\"can-do\\" attitude, adapting well to the many strange situations in which he finds himself. He can, however, also be quite clumsy and unsubtle, once leading the Doctor to declare, in a moment of frustration and at the top of his lungs, that \\"Harry Sullivan is an imbecile!\\" Nonetheless he is well liked by the Doctor and Sarah Jane, and has a slightly flirtatious relationship with her. The character was originally devised by the production team as a means of handling any action scenes required in episodes when they had envisioned that the new Doctor would be played by an older actor, as had previously been the case (Sarah Jane even jokingly compares Harry to James Bond at one point). When forty-year-old Tom Baker was cast, however, this was no longer a concern and the decision was taken to write Harry out ‚Äî something producer Philip Hinchcliffe later admitted was probably a mistake, as Harry was a likeable and popular character who worked well with both of his fellow leads. Harry's last regular appearance is in the season thirteen opener Terror of the Zygons, which had actually been made at the conclusion of the twelfth production block and held over to start the following season. At the conclusion of this story he chooses to return to London by train rather than by TARDIS with the Doctor and Sarah Jane, who continue their adventures without him. He does, however, reappear three stories later in The Android Invasion, both as the original Harry and an android double. This is the character's final appearance in the programme. A later production team gave some consideration to bringing Harry Sullivan back for a guest appearance in the 1983 story Mawdryn Undead, part of the programme's twentieth anniversary season. Their first choice was the character of Ian Chesterton, but those plans fell through due to actor William Russell being unavailable. In the end, they decided to use the character of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (played by Nicholas Courtney) instead. Harry is mentioned in the story, however ‚Äî the Brigadier tells the Fifth Doctor that he was \\"seconded to NATO\\" and was last heard of \\"doing something 'hush-hush' at Porton Down.\\" His photograph appears in the pilot episode of The Sarah Jane Adventures, hanging on the side of a roof joist in Sarah Jane Smith's attic, near a portrait of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and a photograph of Sarah Jane and K-9 Mark III. These were the first uses of classic era imagery in the revived era of the Whoniverse. Also in this episode when Sarah Jane is thinking of names for her son she contemplates choosing the name Harry. In The Sarah Jane Adventures story \\"Death of the Doctor\\", Sarah Jane reveals that Harry continued as a doctor and saved thousands of lives with his vaccines. In \\"The Zygon Inversion\\" Kate Stewart mentions that Sullivan developed a gas known as Z-67, which turns Zygons inside out. The Doctor confiscated the gas and formula to prevent its misuse, referring to the weapon as \\"the imbecile's gas\\", referencing his assertion in \\"Revenge of the Cybermen\\" that \\"Harry Sullivan is an imbecile!\\". Appearances in other media After leaving the cast of the programme, Ian Marter went on to pen several novelisations of Doctor Who stories for Target Books, writing an original novel, Harry Sullivan's War, for them in 1985. In Harry Sullivan's War, the character has become an MI5 operative (supporting the Brigadier's comment in Mawdryn Undead). Marter was believed to have been planning a sequel at the time of his death from a diabetic coma the following year. There was a biography of Sarah Jane Smith which stated that she and Harry developed a romantic relationship after her return from travelling with the Doctor. They later parted amicably and were still very fond of each other.Doctor Who Magazine holiday special 1992 Between 1994 and 2003, the character of Harry appeared in several novels from Virgin Publishing and BBC Books. Some of these stories are set in gaps between televised adventures featuring the character, but in several books he has been seen either earlier or later in life. In the Virgin Missing Adventures novel System Shock (1995) and the Past Doctor Adventures novel Millennium Shock (1999), both by Justin Richards, he is seen during the 1990s as a Deputy Director of MI5. An even later early-21st century Harry has a cameo in the New Adventure Damaged Goods by Russell T Davies. The New Adventure Blood Heat (1993) by Jim Mortimore briefly depicts a parallel universe version of Harry serving on a nuclear submarine in a dystopian world ruled by the Silurians, where he manages to save the life of the Seventh Doctor's companion Bernice Summerfield. In David A. McIntee's Past Doctor Adventure The Face of the Enemy (1998) Harry is seen still working for the Royal Navy before his secondment to UNIT, which he first encounters in the novel. He also appears in the novel Wolfsbane by Jacqueline Rayner, where he briefly aids the currently-amnesic Eighth Doctor in dealing with a plot involving a woman who believes herself to be the reincarnation of Morgan Le Fay in 1936 when the Fourth Doctor's TARDIS accidentally materialises there long enough for Harry to leave, having apparently been drawn off course by its damaged future self. Although the Eighth Doctor's amnesia and subsequent regenerations prevent either the Doctor or Harry from recognizing each other, Harry notes that the Doctor has a certain 'Doctorishness' about him. In the Big Finish Productions audio drama UNIT: The Wasting (2005), Commodore Sullivan (who is working with NATO) is called on by the Brigadier for a favour but does not have a speaking part. Harry's previously unknown younger stepbrother, Will Sullivan (also a medical doctor), appears in the second series of the Sarah Jane Smith Adventures (2005‚Äì2006) audio plays by Big Finish, voiced by Tom Chadbon. Harry is mentioned by both Will and Sarah Jane, but he is apparently on some secret assignment and neither has seen him for a long time. Will is eventually revealed to be a sleeper agent of a religious cult targeting Sarah Jane, and dies during the course of the series. Harry appears in the Titan Doctor Who Ninth Doctor comic storyline Official Secrets, set in the 1970s, where he briefly takes command of UNIT during the Brigadier's absence while investigating the mysterious appearance of large monsters, meeting the Ninth Doctor, Rose Tyler and Captain Jack Harkness during the crisis. =Audio= In 2017, Big Finish released their first story to include the character of Harry Sullivan. It was narrated by The Monk (Rufus Hound) titled How to Win Planets and Influence People. In December 2018 the free subscriber short story Tuesday by Tony Jones also featured Harry Sullivan and was narrated by Stephen Critchlow. In 2019, Big Finish released their third story featuring the character of Harry Sullivan narrated by Leela (Louise Jameson) titled #HarrySullivan. Other mentions A vision of Harry is seen along with every other companion (aside from Leela) on the scanner screen in Resurrection of the Daleks. Harry is also seen calling out to the Doctor just before his regeneration in Logopolis. He is also mentioned in The Sarah Jane Adventures story Death of the Doctor, with Sarah recounting his successful medical career, revealing \\"He did such good work with vaccines. He saved thousands of lives\\". In Doctor Who Magazine issue 512, discussing his 2017 episode \\"Knock Knock', writer Mike Bartlett revealed that the character of Harry in his episode was intended to be the grandson of Harry Sullivan (who, according to this episode, had gone \\"grey-packing\\" with his boyfriend to the Great Wall of China where he was arrested for trying to steal a piece).

Works included The trilogy consists of: #Homeland (1990) ‚Äî Homeland follows the story of Drizzt from around the time and circumstances of his birth and his upbringing amongst the drow (dark elves). The book takes the reader into Menzoberranzan, the drow home city. From here, the reader follows Drizzt on his quest to follow his principles in a land where such feelings are threatened by all his family including his mother Matron Malice. In an essence, the book introduces Drizzt Do'Urden, one of Salvatore's more famous characters from the Icewind Dale Trilogy. #Exile (1990) ‚Äî Exile tells the story of Drizzt outside of the drow cities in the open wilderness of the Underdark. For the ten years following his abandoning his house, he is left with no one but his faithful Guenhwyvar, a magical panther he had acquired in Homeland. Drizzt is also met with great dangers that he meets with the business ends of his scimitars. Struggling with conflicting emotions, which involve his failure in Menzoberranzan and a deep grief for his father and friend Zaknafein, he makes his way to the surface to face newer dangers. #Sojourn (1991) ‚Äî Sojourn is the story of Drizzt coming to the surface of the world and facing adversity due to the infamy of his kin. It follows him trying to find his place among the humans that live between the city of Sundabar and Citadel Adbar. He is rejected, and hunted, before meeting and living with an elderly blind man known as Montolio DeBrouchee. Montolio teaches Drizzt what it means to become a ranger and together they defend Mooshie's home against a raid by local orcs. Drizzt ultimately leaves the Sundabar area and makes his way to Icewind Dale where he befriends Catti-brie and Bruenor Battlehammer and finds a place to call home. Characters *Roddy McGristle is a human bounty hunter, and has two dogs that he uses to hunt and wields an axe named \\"Bleeder.\\" He seeks out the bounty on Drizzt, who kills one of the dogs and injures the other. Roddy's ear is lost and face is scarred when he chops down a tree with his axe - he persists in telling everyone that Drizzt injured him. He begins to follow any rumors based upon Drizzt in order to get revenge upon him, using the deaths of the Thistledowns as an excuse to get men to help. In actuality he cares little for the Thistledowns and later doesn't even care for the bounty, partly because it was determined that Drizzt was not involved in their murder. Making the grudge personal, he eventually tracks Drizzt down to Icewind Dale, but Roddy is easily defeated, though Drizzt could not bring himself to end the man's life. He is then driven from the mountain by Bruenor and is never heard from again. *Clacker is a pech, who is transformed into a Hook Horror by a human wizard. Under the effects of this spell, he forgets his name, much of his past, and eventually his mind begins to transform into that of a mindless beast. He meets Drizzt and Belwar Dissengulp as they journey through the Underdark. The three sought the wizard that cast the spell on Clacker; however, Clacker unwillingly killed him when a comment from the wizard drove him into a primal rage from his Hook Horror instincts. He eventually has a moment of resurgence, where he becomes more in-tune with the earth than a regular pech. He uses his abilities to save his friends, and then asks them to kill him before he completely turns. He is killed by Zaknafein, and his body, having returned to its true form, is placed into a pool of acid. *Belwar Dissengulp is a former burrow-warden of the svirfneblin, another humanoid race in the Underdark. Ten years prior to the events of Exile, Drizzt was part of a raiding party of Menzoberranzan who attacked a mining party of svirfneblin, led by Belwar. Again Drizzt's merciful nature showed, and he convinced his group to let Belwar live (using the excuse that he could serve as a warning to the svirfneblin against venturing so close to Menzoberranzan). However, Drizzt's brother, Dinin, decided to sever both his hands as an example. 10 years pending Drizzt's self-imposed exile, he ventured into the svirfneblin city of Blingdenstone, where he requested to speak with Belwar, whose hands had been replaced with a magical hammer and pickaxe. The former burrow-warden decided to take Drizzt into his home and keep responsibility for him, knowing that he owed his life to him. When Drizzt was forced to leave the city (the city fearing the drow hunting him), Belwar decided to join him in his adventures through the Underdark, and only left when Drizzt told of his intentions to go to the surface. *Kellindil A wood elf, and part of Dove Falconhand's group, he meets Drizzt and attacks him assuming him the enemy, though pending the Drow's retreat and lack of violence toward him he suspects Drizzt's good intentions. He then keeps an eye on Drizzt during the time he spent with Mooshie. He and his elves arrive in time to offer some help in the attack from King Graul and his orcs. He finds Roddy and takes him captive intending to question him. However Roddy is freed and kills him. *Montolio DeBrouchee is an aging Human ranger, nicknamed 'Mooshie.' Though he was blinded in a battle against a dragon, he learned to utilize his other senses, as well as his connection with nature, to make up for his disability. He is the one who discovered Drizzt's true calling as a Ranger and taught him how to embrace it and make use of his abilities. Soon before Mooshie's death, he coerced a promise from Drizzt to try to find a place in the world instead of lingering in the forest alone; as Mooshie died in his sleep, Drizzt honored his lost friend by keeping his promise.

When practiced by males, orgasm control allows the practitioner to enjoy direct sexual stimulation without waiting through the refractory period common after orgasm. When the decision is made to allow orgasm, the physical sensations may be much greater and more pleasurable than if the orgasm were experienced conventionally. Orgasm control is referenced as \\"slow masturbation\\" in Alex Comfort's The New Joy of Sex (1993)The New Joy of Sex, Alex Comfort, (1993), . and \\"extended massive orgasm\\" in Vera and Steve Bodansky's 2000 book of the same name, and is similar to the Venus Butterfly technique used in the volume The One Hour Orgasm (1988) by Leah and Bob Schwartz. Since orgasm control prolongs the experience of powerful sexual sensations occurring during the final build-up to orgasm, the physical demands of being kept or keeping oneself in this highly excited state for an extended time can induce a pleasurable, almost euphoric state. Orgasm control can involve either sex partner being in control of the other partner's orgasm, or a person delaying their own orgasm during sexual activity with a partner or by masturbation. To experience orgasm control, any method of sexual stimulation can be used.  In partnered sex  When shared in sexual activity between partners, one partner would stimulate the other, gradually bringing them up to the point high in the plateau phase where an orgasm is actually building, and will then reduce the level of stimulation to just below that needed to trigger the orgasm. If control of the orgasm is given to a partner and orgasm is not allowed for a time in order to develop an increased level of sexual tension, it is referred to as erotic sexual denial. By carefully varying the intensity and speed of stimulation, and by practicing with the same partner to learn his or her responses, a person can be held in the highly aroused state near orgasm. This process may be repeated as desired, but at some point repetition may cause the urge to orgasm to become overwhelming. When a partner eventually provides enough stimulation to achieve an orgasm, it may be stronger than usual due to the increased tension and arousal that builds up during the extended stimulation. If the partner whose orgasm is being controlled, sometimes referred to as the submissive partner, is tied up, it may better control the orgasm (the activity is sometimes called tie and tease and if orgasm is denied it is tease and denial). Another possibility is for one partner to help produce multiple orgasms in the other.  In masturbation  When practiced alone, orgasm control is beneficial for heightening sexual pleasure as well as a training tool which permits the practitioner to increase the duration of sex with a partner. For the female, because there is little or no post-orgasm refractory period, the practitioner can enjoy direct sexual stimulation for longer periods of time, as well as with increased frequency and intensity. For the male, the speed of the rubbing or stroking of the penis may vary to navigate right to the edge of ejaculation. With orgasm control, a male can experience a longer or more intense orgasm, as well as a larger volume of semen expelled during his ejaculation. Because solo masturbation allows for precise control over the feelings, the timing, and the speed of stimulation, many people practice orgasmic control by themselves. One technique, commonly referred to as 'edging', involves masturbating up until the moment before reaching the plateau phase just before orgasm occurs, and then stopping suddenly before experiencing a climax. Another technique, commonly referred to as 'surfing', involves reaching the plateau phase and slowing down the stimulation to maintain a heightened level of sensation for an extended time. Repeating either of these techniques many times during a single masturbation session may result in a stronger, more intense orgasm. Many individuals assert that orgasm control is more often possible with masturbation. This is a direct result of the fact that one is then able to control the intensity and duration of stimulation without having to rely on the partner stopping or changing the type of stimulation in order to postpone the orgasm. Masturbation is then the easy way to learn one's limits and could also be seen as the starting point in the technique of orgasm control. Orgasm control is most easily learned through solitary masturbation, although many individuals enjoy including elements of orgasm control in sex with a partner. Masturbation provides the individual with the opportunity of learning about their bodies and the amount of pleasure they can experience without reaching orgasm. Self-stimulation can help both men and women acknowledge the limits of their body and the techniques that may help them in controlling their orgasms. Recent research study suggests masturbation may decrease incidence of prostate cancer.Leitzmann MF, Platz EA, Stampfer MJ, Willett WC, Giovannucci E. Ejaculation frequency and subsequent risk of prostate cancer. JAMA. 2004 Apr 7:291 (13): 1578-86. As it has been described by Steve Bodansky and Vera Bodansky in Extended Massive Orgasm: How You Can Give and Receive Intense Sexual Pleasure, masturbation practiced with the aim of orgasm control must be carried on with the purpose of making every stroke feel exquisite and not to relieve tension, as 'simple' masturbation does. In order to practice this other type of masturbation, the same authors suggest gradual stimulation of the genitals and then making connections between the primary area (penis or clitoris) and the secondary area (lips, nipple or other part of the body that is an erogenous zone). The connection between the two areas is established once the individual stimulates them with exactly the same moves of the same intensity.

Epithets are used because of the constraints of the dactylic hexameter (i.e., it is convenient to have a stockpile of metrically fitting phrases to add to a name) and because of the oral transmission of the poems; they are mnemonic aids to the singer and the audience alike.Parry 1928: 5-10 Epithets in epic poetry from various Indo- European traditions may be traced to a common tradition. For example, the phrase for \\"everlasting glory\\" or \\"undying fame\\" can be found in the Homeric Greek as / kl√©os √°phthiton and Vedic Sanskrit as / ≈õr√°vo √°k·π£itam. These two phrases were, in terms of historical linguistics, equivalent in phonology, accentuation, and quantity (syllable length). In other words, they descend from a fragment of poetic diction (reconstructable as Proto-Indo-European ) which was handed down in parallel over many centuries, in continually diverging forms, by generations of singers whose ultimate ancestors shared an archetypal repertoire of poetic formulae and narrative themes.John Curtis Franklin, Structural Sympathies in Ancient Greek and South-Slavic Heroic Singing. Epithets alter the meaning of each noun to which they are attached. They specify the existential nature of a noun; that is to say, Achilles is not called \\"swift-footed\\" only when he runs; it is a marker of a quality that does not change. Special epithets, such as patronymics, are used exclusively for particular subjects and distinguish them from others, while generic epithets are used of many subjects and speak less to their individual characters. In these examples, the epithet can be contradictory to the past state of the subject: in Odyssey VI.74, for instance, Nausicaa takes her \\"radiant clothing\\", ·ºêœÉŒ∏·øÜœÑŒ± œÜŒ±ŒµŒπŒΩŒÆŒΩ, to be washed;

Together, the three novels complete an American Civil War trilogy relating events from 1858 to 1865. The Last Full Measure (and Gods and Generals, 1996) was written by Jeffrey Shaara after his father, Michael Shaara, author of the Pulitzer Prize- winning The Killer Angels died in 1988. Employing the same style as the previous two books in the series, The Last Full Measure takes the reader inside the minds of several of the most important officers of the Union and Confederate Armies as they regroup after Gettysburg and march on into the final two years of the war. Returning from the previous novels are General Robert E. Lee and the newly promoted Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain. The new addition to this volume is Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant, who is given control of all Northern troops after a series of poor commanders have failed to ensure victory. From the Overland Campaign to the Siege of Petersburg, from Chamberlain's home in Maine to Appomattox Court House, Shaara gives a detailed account of honorable men whose heroism, egotism, and occasional outright incompetence changed the course of United States history. The novel's title comes from a line in the Gettysburg Address: \\"It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us‚Äîthat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.\\" In following suit of the novels The Killer Angels and Gods and Generals, The Last Full Measure was also planned to be made into a feature film by media mogul Ted Turner. However, Gods and Generals did so poorly at the box office that the project was soon abandoned due to lack of interest and funding.

Rectovaginal fistulae may be extremely debilitating. If the opening between the rectum and vagina is wide it will allow both flatulence and feces to escape through the vagina, leading to fecal incontinence. There is an association with recurrent urinary and vaginal infections. The fistula may also connect the rectum and urethra, which is called recto-urethral fistula. Either conditions can lead to labial fusion. This type of fistula can cause pediatricians to misdiagnose imperforate anus. The severity of the symptoms will depend on the size of fistula. Most often, it appears after about one week or so after delivery. Causes Rectovaginal fistulas are often the result of trauma during childbirth (in which case it is known as obstetric fistula), with increased risk associated with significant lacerations or interventions are used such as episiotomy or operative (forceps/vacuum extraction) deliverieshttp://www.fascrs.org/core-subject/rectovaginal-fistula-and- rectourethral-fistula or in situations where there is inadequate health care, such as in some developing countries. Rectovaginal fistula is said to be known as the leading cause in maternal death in developing countries.Landry, 926 Risk factors include prolonged labour, difficult instrumental delivery and paramedian episiotomy. Rates in Eritrea are estimated as high as 350 per 100,000 vaginal births. Fistulas can also develop as a result of physical trauma to either the vagina or anus, including from rape. Women with rectovaginal fistulae are often stigmatized in developing countries, and become outcasts. Rectovaginal fistula can also be a symptom of various diseases, including infection by lymphogranuloma venereum, or the unintended result of surgery, such as episiotomy or sexual reassignment surgery. They may present as a complication of vaginal surgery, including vaginal hysterectomy. They are a recognized presentation of rectal carcinoma or rarely diverticular disease of the bowel or Crohn's disease. They are seen rarely after radiotherapy treatment for cervical cancer. Diagnosis Treatment After diagnosing rectovaginal fistula, it is best to wait for around 3 months to allow the inflammation to subside. For low fistulae, a vaginal approach is best, while an abdominal repair would be necessary for a high fistula at the posterior fornix. A circular incision is made around the fistula and vagina is separated from the underlying rectum with a sharp circumferential dissection. The entire fistulous tract, along with a small rim of rectal mucosa is incised. The rectal wall is then closed extramucosally. Most rectovaginal fistulas will need surgery to fix. Medications such as antibiotics and Infliximab might be prescribed to help close the rectovaginal fistula or prepare for surgery.

Commodore Jan van Galen Johan \\"Jan\\" van Galen (1604 - 23 March 1653) was a Commodore of the Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands. he participated in the First Anglo-Dutch War. Biography Johan van Galen Johan van Galen was born in Essen. He fought in the Eighty Years' War against Spain, becoming a captain in 1630 and a regular captain in 1635, mostly fighting the Dunkirkers. In 1639, he fought in the Battle of the Downs under the command of Joris van Cats. In 1645, as a Rear-Admiral, Van Galen was part of Vice-Admiral Witte de With's convoy breaking the blockade of The Sound by Denmark. Both men were very hot-tempered and proud; emotions ran so high that, at one point, in anger, Van Galen lowered his command flag and trampled it with his feet. De With put him in chains and delivered him to the capital of the adversary, Copenhagen. The embarrassed Danish court released Van Galen after an intervention by the French envoy. A peculiarity of Van Galen is that he never served in the navy proper, an institution he disliked, but was employed by the Amsterdam Direction Chamber, a private organisation supporting the official navy. After the Republic had made peace with Spain in 1648, Van Galen was sent out three times, with Spanish assistance, to fight the corsairs of the Barbary Coast. In 1649, he was badly wounded when a gang of Spanish criminals intercepted him when he was returning in a sloop with prize money. Funerary monument in the Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam) Van Galen retired late in 1650, but when the First Anglo-Dutch War between the Republic and the Commonwealth of England broke out, he was asked by the States-General, on 3 July 1652, to assume command of a Dutch fleet in the Mediterranean, as a Commodore and replacing Commandeur Joris van Cats. He departed on 24 July, reaching Livorno on 22 August. He was mortally wounded during the Battle of Leghorn, where his fleet destroyed part of the English Mediterranean Fleet. A cannonball smashed his right lower leg; it was amputated below-deck and afterwards, Van Galen continued to direct the battle. He died from wound fever ten days later in Livorno on 13 March 1653. Cornelis Tromp was then a young captain under his command. Van Galen was given a state burial in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam and in 1656, a marble grave memorial was erected on which this poem is inscribed: Notes References  * G.G.

It is the national monument of the Republic of Indonesia, built to commemorate the struggle for Indonesian independence. Construction began in 1961 under the direction of President Sukarno. Monas was opened to the public in 1975. It is topped by a flame covered with gold foil. The monument and the museum are open daily from 08.00 until 16.00 Western Indonesia Time (UTC+7) throughout the week except for the Mondays when the monument is closed. Since April 2016, the monument also opens during night time, from 19.00 until 22.00 in Tuesday to Friday, and from 19.00 until 00.00 in Saturday and Sunday. Background Sukarno inspect monas construction. After the Indonesian government returned to Jakarta from Yogyakarta in 1950 following the Dutch recognition of Indonesian independence, President Sukarno began to contemplate the construction of a national monument comparable to the Eiffel Tower on the square in front of the Presidential Palace. On 17 August 1954, a National Monument Committee was established and a design competition was held in 1955. This attracted 51 entries, but only one design, by Frederich Silaban, met any of the criteria determined by the committee, which included reflecting the character of Indonesia in a building capable of lasting for centuries. A repeat competition was held in 1960, but once again, none of the 136 entries met the criteria. The chairman of the jury team then asked Silaban to show his design to Sukarno. However, Sukarno did not like the design as he wanted the monument to be in the form of a linga and yoni. Silaban was asked to design such a monument, but his design was for a monument so large that it would have been unaffordable given the economic conditions at the time. Silaban refused to design a smaller monument, suggesting that construction be delayed until the Indonesian economy improved. Sukarno then asked the architect R.M. Soedarsono to continue with the design. Soedarsono incorporated the numbers 17, 8 and 45, representing the 17 August 1945 Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, in the dimensions of the monument.National monument Office, Jakarta (1996) pp. 3-9The height of the goblet yard at the base of the plinth is 17m, the width of the plinth at the base is 8m and the width of the goblet yard is 45m Construction Construction of Monas The construction of Monas proceeded in three stages. The first period, from 1961/1962‚Äì1964/1965 began with the official start of construction on 17 August 1961 with Sukarno ceremonially driving in the first concrete pile. A total of 284 piles were used for the foundation block. A further 360 piles were driven in for the museum foundations, with work being completed in March 1962. The walls of the museum in the base were completed by October. Construction of the obelisk then commenced and was finished in August 1963. Work in the second stage, from 1966 to 1968, was delayed by shortages of funding and the aftermath of the 30 September Movement coup attempt. In the final phase, from 1969‚Äì1976, the dioramas for the historical museum were added. Problems remained once construction was complete, and work was needed to solve problems with water leaking into the museum. Monas was officially opened to the public on 12 July 1975.National monument Office, Jakarta (1996) pp. 12-23Jakarta Administration website The location of Monas is known as Merdeka Square. Monument design \\"Monas\\" and the Jakarta skyline The towering monument encapsulates the philosophy of Lingga and Yoni. Lingga resembles an alu rice pestle and Yoni resembles a lesung rice mortar, two important traditional Indonesian tools. Lingga and Yoni also symbolize harmony, balance, fertility and eternal life with the lingga phallic symbol, representing masculinity, positive elements, and daytime and the Yoni the female organs symbol, representing femininity, negative elements, and night. It also resembles the bloom of the famous Amorphophallus titanum, native to Indonesia. Indeed, fiberglass Amorphophallus and Rafflesia sculptures were once installed around the monument. The monument consists of a 117.7m obelisk on a 45m square platform at a height of 17m, the goblet yard. The obelisk itself is clad with Italian marble.Monument Nasional brochure; Dinas Pariwisata dan Kebudayaan Provinsi DKI Jakarta, Unit Pengelola Monumen NasionalNational monument Office, Jakarta (1996) p. 5 The northern pond measuring 25√ó25 m was designed to cool water for the air conditioning system of Monas as well as to enhance the beauty of the surrounding area. To the north, there is a statue of Indonesia national hero Prince Diponegoro by Italian sculptor Cobertaldo.National monument Office, Jakarta (1996) pp. 28-29 Reliefs of Indonesian history Relief of Indonesian history In the outer yard surrounding Monas there are reliefs of Indonesian history. The story begins in the northeastern corner and describes events during eras such as the Singhasari and Majapahit empires. The reliefs extend along the four walls showing the European colonialization of the Indonesian archipelago, various popular local uprisings, modern Indonesian organizations in the early 20th century, the Japanese occupation in World War II, the Proclamation of Independence, and post-independence developments. The reliefs were made from molded cement although several of the statues are damaged and have decayed due to weathering. The National History Museum The Indonesian National History Museum has a display of dioramas in the large marble-lined hall below Monas. There are a total of 51 dioramas around the walls and in the centre of the hall. The dioramas begin in the northeastern corner, displaying the scenes from Indonesian history from the beginning during the earliest days of Prehistoric Indonesia, the construction of Borobudur, the Sriwijaya and Majapahit eras, followed with events from the period of European colonization and uprisings against Dutch East Indies Company and Dutch East Indies rule. The dioramas continue well into the 20th century showing the Japanese occupation, the proclamation of Indonesian independence in 1945, the struggle for independence of Indonesian revolution, and on to events during the New Order era of Suharto's regime. The Hall of Independence Hall of Independence, Gate of Independence in the left wall and Garuda Pancasila the right side The Hall of Independence () is situated inside the goblet or \\"cup\\" part of Monas (). The hall, which contains various symbols of independence, can be reached through spiral stairs at the north and south doors.National monument Office, Jakarta (1996) pp. 24-28 The original text of the Proclamation of Independence is stored in a glass case inside the bronze golden door. On the west side of the inner wall. Mechanized bronze doors weigh 4 tons and are coated with goldleaf adorned with the image of a Wijaya Kusuma flower, symbolizing eternity, and a lotus flower, symbolizing purity. The doors, known as Gerbang Kemerdekaan or the Gate of Independence, open slowly while the nationalist Padamu Negeri song plays followed by a recording of Sukarno reading the text of the Proclamation. On the southern wall there is a large bronze gold-coated statue of the coat of arms of Indonesia weighing 3.5 tons. On the eastern side is the text of the proclamation in bronze lettering. Originally the eastern side displayed the most sacred Indonesian flag, Sang Saka Merah Putih, originally raised on 17 August 1945. However, because it is fragile and in poor condition it is no longer displayed. The wall on the northern side displays a map of the Indonesian archipelago coated in gold. There is a middle platform on top of the cawan (goblet) which provides visitors with views from a height of 17 metres. This middle platform is accessible through the elevator on the way down from the main observation deck (the lift stops on the way down at the cawan to allow visitors to exit) or through stairs from below. The Observation Deck and Flame of Independence Monas observation deck crowned with gold-coated flame of independence A lift on the southern side carries visitors to the viewing platform at a height of 115 metres above ground level. The capacity of the elevator is about 11 people. The top platform can accommodate about 50 people. There is also a staircase for use in emergencies. The total height of the monument is 132 metres. The distance from the viewing platform to the tip of the flame is 17 metres. The ticket to observation deck is Rp.10,000 (adults, 2016). Monas is topped by a 14.5 ton bronze Flame of Independence containing the lift engine. The base of the flame, in the shape of a goblet, is 3 metres high. The bronze flame structure measures 14 metres in height and 6 metres in diameter, It consists of 77 sections. Originally the bronze flame structure was covered with 35 kgHeuken (2008) p25 of gold foil. However, during the 50th anniversary of Indonesian independence in 1995, the gold foil was recoated and increased to 50 kgNational monument Office, Jakarta (1996) p28 gold foil. The obelisk and flame symbolize the Indonesia people's struggle for independence. Visitation The observation desk and other facilities are open daily from 08.00-16.00 daily (except for Mondays). The entrance to Monas is located around 100 meters away to the northern side of the monument. Visitors enter by steps down to a tunnel which leads back towards the base of the Monas. There is a ticket office (Rp 5,000 for adults, Rp 2,000 for children, 2016) at the end of the tunnel. Tickets allow access to the National History Museum display of dioramas as well as several other parts of the area. Tickets for access to the observation desk cost another Rp 10,000 for adults (2016) and may be purchased at a second booth after passing through the hall showing the diorama display. It is best to go early, preferably arriving before 08.00 am, and proceed directly to the lift to the observation tower. The lift has a capacity of perhaps 160 people per hour so long queues build up quickly. The other parts of the monument, including the dioramas in the hall below the Monas, can be viewed later. Since April 2016, the monument also open during nighttime, from 19.00 until 22.00 in Tuesday to Friday, and from 19.00 until 00.00 in Saturday and Sunday. The ticket to ascend to the upper viewing platform however, are limited and visiting times are distributed and scheduled to avoid long queue. Everyday, the management only sold 1,800 tickets for day visit and 700 tickets for night visit to the observation deck.

The surviving painting is a fragment of a triptych that was cut into several parts. The Ship of Fools was painted on one of the wings of the altarpiece, and is about two thirds of its original length. The bottom third of the panel belongs to Yale University Art Gallery and is exhibited under the title Allegory of Gluttony. The wing on the other side, which has more or less retained its full length, is the Death and the Miser, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.. The two panels together would have represented the two extremes of prodigality and miserliness, condemning and caricaturing both. The Wayfarer was painted on the right panel rear of the triptych. The central panel, if existed, is unknown. Dating/provenance A reconstruction of the left and right wings of the triptych: at upper left The Ship of Fools; at lower left: Allegory of Gluttony and Lust. Panel at right is Death and the Miser. At bottom \\"The Wayfarer\\" which would have been on the outside of the triptych. Dendrochronological study has dated the wood to 1491, and it is tempting to see the painting as a response to Sebastian Brant's Das Narrenschiff or even the illustrations of the first edition of 1493. Another possible source for the ship allegory is the 14th-century Le P√®lerinage de l'√Çme by Guillaume de Deguileville, which was printed in Dutch in 1486 (shortly after William Caxton printed it as The Pylgremage of the Sowle in 1483).Walter Bosing: Heronymus Bosch Between Heaven and Hell (London 1994) reprinted as Bosch The Complete Paintings (Taschen 1994) pp. 29‚Äì30 A ', also in the Louvre, appears to be a later copy. Dendrochronological studies by Peter Klein have radically altered the provenance of some paintings, for instance the Escorial Crowning with Thorns panel can only have been painted after 1525 and so is not a Bosch original. The same goes for the Rotterdam Marriage feast at Cana panel which can only have been painted after 1553. It has also become clear that the Rotterdam Pedlar tondo, the Paris Ship of Fools panel and the Washington Death of a Miser panel have been painted on wood from the same tree. The two to eight years between the felling of the tree and its use as a painting substrate allows The Ship of Fools to be a direct satire of a frontispiece of Sebastian Brant's book.

It is best known for being an aircraft training centre during the Second World War and is a popular yachting location. The village and the River Hamble also featured in the 1980s BBC television series Howards' Way. The village centre, known as The Square, Hamble, has a more traditional English village aesthetic which differentiates it from the small industrial areas (mostly marinas) close to the village. Location Hamble-le-Rice is on the south coast of England, south-east of Southampton at the tip of the Hamble peninsula, bounded by Netley, Butlocks Heath, Bursledon, Southampton Water and the River Hamble. History Although previously known as \\"Hamble\\", \\"Hamelea\\", \\"Hammel\\", and \\"Ham-en-le-Rice\\", the village's official name is now Hamble-le-Rice. The name \\"Hamble\\" is still in common usage. To the south of the village, lies the site of an Iron Age promontory hillfort, Hamble Common Camp. The area is home to the remains of a defensive structure dating to the reign of King Henry VIII. Known as St Andrew's castle, investigations suggest that it consisted of a rectangular structure fronted by a gun platform with a semi-circular layout. The structure was protected by a moat, with a two gun platforms mounted on the counterscarp. The structure was intact as late as the early 17th century. Aerospace Hamble-le-Rice was the home of a major flying school before and during the Second World War for aircraft including the Spitfire, the Lancaster and the Wellington. Over 500 aircraft were built there including the prototype Armstrong Whitworth Ensign and Albemarle which were first flown in 1938 and 1940. In 1960 the Air Corporations Joint Training Scheme (later, British Airways) fixed wing and helicopter training school was established there, as the College of Air Training, Hamble. The south airfield has long since disappeared and the north airfield has been partially developed as housing, the remainder is overgrown and owned by property developers Persimmon. The aviation industry retains a large interest in Hamble-le-Rice, with the Hamble Aerostructures factory, now a subsidiary of GE Aviation in Kings Avenue. The following units were here at some point: * No. 1 Basic Air Navigation School RAF * No. 2 Air Experience Flight RAF * No. 3 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School RAF * No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School RAF * No. 11 Air Observers Navigation School RAF * No. 14 Reserve Flying School RAF * No. 15 Ferry Pilots Pool RAF * 780 Naval Air Squadron * No. 2706 Squadron RAF Regiment * Southampton University Air Squadron Industrial Areas Hamble-le-Rice is home to three main marinas offering marine services and goods to the boating industry. In addition, large factories and smaller industrial units off Ensign Way and Hamble Lane are used by CooperVision, BP, Hoyer, GE and others. Some of these businesses are 24 hour operations with large numbers of staff who commute to work. The fuel terminal itself is not visible from the B3397: there was extensive development in the early 2000s when wartime hangars were demolished and high density housing built next to the road, near the terminal. The Royal Yachting Association (RYA), a non- profit organisation, has its offices in Hamble. Schools There are two schools in Hamble-Le-Rice: Hamble Primary School Hamble School, a secondary school (formerly Hamble Community Sports College) The River and Environment Hamble-le-Rice is a boating mecca: the nearby River Hamble is often packed with marine traffic and during the summer the whole village is crowded with people out enjoying the water, local restaurants and many pubs. The village and its river is one of the many locations that made up the fictional village of Tarrant in the BBC television series Howards' Way, shown weekly on BBC1 in the late 1980s. Hamble-le-Rice is home to a common, a variety of estuary wildlife, and other scenic walks. Fuel terminal This WWII Anti Aircraft emplacement on Hamble Common protected the fuel terminal and jetty (both visible in background)Hamble fuel terminal was opened by Shell in 1924, whilst BP was still afloat using a converted passenger liner as a fuel tender. In 1930 the two companies formed a joint venture and BP moved to Hamble. This partnership was dissolved in 1976, with the Hamble terminal passing to BP. A 2016 attempt to sell off the terminal was unsuccessful; however Hoyer now handles BPs bulk fuel road transport operation. A pipeline runs under Southampton Water from the Fawley oil refinery which supplies the BP fuel terminal at Hamble. This fuel terminal was used to supply PLUTO, during the invasion of Europe in World War II.Hampshire and D-Day. Martin Doughty. 1994. The PLUTO pipeline started at Shanklin on the Isle of Wight and was supplied by ship from Hamble. The jetty at this fuel terminal was extended in 1943/44 so that more ships could be loaded simultaneously. Fuel is transported from this depot both day and night, in particular early mornings (between 3am and 6am), by 44 tonne road tankers along the B3397, as well as by pipeline to major industry and airports. Markers showing the route of the pipeline can be seen at various points in neighbouring Botley. A now disused branch line ran from the terminal to the Portsmouth to Southampton railway. This is now the scenic Strawberry Trail. Transport links The Hamble Peninsula has one main access road, the B3397 (Hamble Lane) which is approximately 3 miles long and goes straight through the village. Hamble Lane has had numerous incidences of traffic accidents.https://meetings.eastleigh.gov.uk/documents/s1628/HAMBLANE.pdf and at its intersection with Portsmouth Road an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) exists to monitor nitrogen dioxide traffic pollutants.https://www.eastleigh.gov.uk/media/39371/EBC-Action-Plan-Hamble- Lane-2012.doc The B3397 is a very high volume road; the last traffic count in March 2003 shows around 16,300 vehicles in a 24-hour period. Daily traffic congestion and slow moving queues are due to the large number of inbound and outbound commuters, on staggered work shifts. Many businesses supply local companies as BP Oil UK, CooperVision and GE Aviation and minor industry and services within the four marinas and industrial areas off Ensign Way. Road oil and petrol tankers form the bulk of the heavy goods vehicles along this road, numbering a few hundred vehicle movements per day. The village is served by Hamble railway station, about 2 miles from the centre of the village, which provides hourly services to both Southampton Central and Portsmouth Harbour.http://www.eastleigh.gov.uk/meetings/documents/s1627/EN914.pdf It is also linked by a pedestrian ferry to Warsash, and has frequent bus services to Southampton and Eastleigh.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it lies north of Grassington, at the point where Wharfedale is joined by a minor road (Cam Gill Road) which leads north-east from the village over Park Rash Pass to Coverdale. Great Whernside rises to the east. The population of the civil parish (Kettlewell with Starbotton) was 322 at the 2011 census, with an estimated population of 340 in 2015. History It is believed that the name Kettlewell is Anglo Saxon and comes from Chetelewelle which means a bubbling spring or stream. Signs of the farming methods of Romano-British and early medieval agriculture can still be seen in terraced fields to the north and the south of the village. In the 13th century a market was established in Kettlewell, which became a thriving community. The Thursday market mostly sold corn outside the King's Arms.http://kettlewellvillage.co.uk/history/ Textiles (and, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, lead mining) revitalised the village and Kettlewell's appearance today derives much from its past 200 years. The remains of the smelting-mill, used from 1700 to 1880, can be seen near the meeting of Cam Gill and Dowber Gill Becks half a mile above the village. In 1686 Kettlewell and Starbotton were almost destroyed in a flood. Heavy rainfall descended on the adjacent hills and cascaded down into the village demolishing several houses and causing the residents to flee.Genuki website On 5 July 2014, the Tour de France Stage 1 from Leeds to Harrogate passed through the village. Governance The village is part of Kettlewell with Starbotton parish in the Craven district of North Yorkshire. The village is in the parliamentary constituency of Skipton and Ripon, the seat has been held by the Conservative Party ever since its creation in 1983. Geography Kettlewell Beck joins the River Wharfe in Kettlewell. Kettlewell is situated in Upper Wharfedale around two miles upstream of where it converges with Littondale. The B6160 crosses the River Wharfe by a stone bridge. The village is situated just west of the confluence of Dowber Gill Beck and Cam Gill Beck, which join to form Kettlewell Beck flowing through the village to join the River Wharfe. There are many small bridges across Kettlewell Beck which dissect the village. Economy A disinfectant-bath in Kettlewell during the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak. Historically Kettlewell's economy revolved around lead mining and farming. Farming was adversely affected by the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak. There are several farms which mostly rely on sheep farming. There is a small service economy serving village residents, tourists and walkers. Kettlewell is on the Dales Way and is a popular starting point for ascents of Great Whernside and Buckden Pike. Rights of way connect the village to Nidderdale and Arncliffe in Littondale. The three village pubs are on the Inn Way and the Racehorses Hotel, the Bluebell Inn and the King's Head all provide accommodation. In addition to the three inns, there are numerous guesthouses, holiday cottages and a village shop, a tasting deli, two caf√©s and a filling station with a mechanic's garage. There is a large YDNPA car park and the National Park Authority operates public conveniences adjacent to the main car park. St Mary's Church The village has 17th and 18th century houses, including the vicarage. The church, St Mary's, as we see it today was rebuilt during the 19th century and stands on a site that dates back to 1120 when the (Norman) de Arches family established a church here. An example of 20th century architecture is the 1960s-built chapel at Scargill House, which is now a Christian conference centre. Transport Kettlewell is connected by bus to Skipton, Grassington and Buckden. The village is the northern starting point of the Yorkshire Water Way to Langsett Reservoir in South Yorkshire. Kettlewell lies on the Dales Way footpath. Fauna and flora The area is known for Swaledale Sheep which are extensively farmed in the area. There are deer in the area, though these are rarely sighted. There are areas of forestland to the south-east of the village, while the open valley to the north has little tree cover. Events In August the village hosts a scarecrow festival where scarecrows, dressed up as different characters are placed around the village. Popular culture *A children's television character from The Rottentrolls takes its name from the village. *Kettlewell represented the village of Knapely in the 2003 film, Calendar Girls.

They, along with a number of other community unions, are affiliated under ACORN International.  Organization  In the US, ACORN was composed of a number of legally distinct nonprofit entities and affiliates including a nationwide umbrella organization established as a 501(c)(4) that performed lobbying; local chapters established as 501(c)(3) nonpartisan charities; and the national nonprofit and nonstock organization, ACORN Housing Corporation. ACORN's priorities included: better housing and wages for the poor, more community development investment from banks and governments, better public schools, labor-oriented causes and social justice issues. ACORN pursued these goals through demonstration, negotiation, lobbying for legislation, and voter participation. Unlike in the US, ACORN groups in other countries have little organisational funding. Under the ACORN model, most members are volunteers. Employed union organisers come from those working in local ACORN campaigns rather than from existing organisations and are paid a low wage. The union works on local and national level campaigns. History Founded in 1970 by Wade Rathke and Gary Delgado, at its peak ACORN had over 500,000 members and more than 1,200 neighborhood chapters in over 100 cities across the U.S. as well as groups in other countries. In 2004, ACORN International was created to aid the spread of ACORN's model to other countries. For example, there has been or currently is an ACORN presence in Argentina, Canada, Mexico, Peru and the UK,A. Gilchrist and M. Taylor, The Short Guide to Community Development 2nd edn (Bristol: Policy Press, 2016) with affiliate groups in ScotlandP. Smythe, 'Housing will be the basis for all change in our country': an interview with Living Rent' (29/04/20) in The Student and France.J. Talpin, 'The Americanization of French social movements? Community organizing and its discontents in the banlieues' (29/06/17) on metropolitics.org In the US, ACORN suffered a damaging nationwide controversy in the fall of 2009 after James O'Keefe and Hannah Giles secretly made, edited and released videos of interactions with low-level ACORN personnel in several of their offices, inaccurately portraying the personnel as encouraging criminal behavior.California AG Determines ACORN Broke No Criminal Laws FOX News; April 1, 2010An Independent Governance Assessment of ACORN , December 7, 2009\\"ACORN Workers Cleared Of Illegality By Outside Probe\\"\\"ACORN and the Ethics of Leadership\\", Atlantic Monthly, December 8, 2009ACORN Investigation Results , The Nonprofit Quarterly\\"Damaging Brooklyn ACORN Sting Video Ruled 'Heavily Edited' ‚Äì No Charges to Be Filed,‚Äù New York Magazine; March 2, 2010 The organization didn't recover in the US and dissolved,ACORN filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy; Los Angeles Times; November 2, 2010 with ACORN members and organizers forming new organizations. ACORN groups outside of the US continued unaffected. ACORN, under ACORN International, still works within the US through its Home Savers Campaign, for example.Akers, Seymour, Butler, Rathke, 'Liquid tenancy: 'Post-crisis' economies of displacement, community organizing, and new forms of resistance' in Radical Housing Journal, April 2019 Vol 1(1): 9‚Äì28  Issues and actions  =Predatory lending and affordable housing= ACORN investigated complaints against companies accused of predatory lending practices. ACORN also worked to support strict state laws against predatory practices, organized against foreclosure rescue scams, and steered borrowers toward loan counseling; Following a three-year campaign, Household International (now owned by HSBC Holdings and renamed HSBC Finance Corporation), one of the largest subprime lenders in the country, and ACORN announced on November 25, 2003 a proposed settlement of a 2002 national class- action lawsuit brought by ACORN. The settlement created a $72 million foreclosure avoidance program to provide relief to household borrowers who were at risk of losing their homes. The settlement came on the heels of an earlier $484 million settlement between Household, Attorneys General, and bank regulators from all 50 U.S. states. ACORN and its affiliates advocated for affordable housing by urging the development, rehabilitation and establishment of housing trust funds at the local, state, and federal levels. The group also pushed for enforcement of affordable-housing requirements for developers and promoted programs to help homeowners repair their homes and organize tenant demands. An ACORN official voiced support for a proposal Hillary Clinton made during the 2008 presidential primary election to create a federal fund for distressed homeowners. =Living wages= ACORN volunteers were among those making street and traffic signs in New Orleans to replace signage lost in the Katrina disaster. Living wage ordinances require private businesses that do business with the government to pay their workers a wage that enables them to afford basic necessities. ACORN has helped pass local living wage laws in 15 cities including Chicago, New Westminster, British Columbia, Oakland, Denver, and New York City. ACORN maintained a website that provides strategic and logistical assistance on this issue to organizations nationwide. =Hurricane Katrina relief= ACORN members across the country, particularly in the Gulf region, organized fund-raising and organizing drives to ensure that victims of Hurricane Katrina received assistance and will be able to return to affected areas. ACORN's home clean-out demonstration program has gutted and rebuilt over 1,850 homes with the help of volunteers. The ACORN Katrina Survivors Association formed in the aftermath of the storm is the first nationwide organization for Katrina survivors and has been working for equitable treatment for victims. Displaced citizens were bused into the city for the New Orleans primary and general elections. By October 2007, ACORN said its Housing Services had helped more than 2,000 homeowners affected by the storm. The non- profit was officially working with the city on reconstruction. =Education= ACORN supported education reform, usually in the form of organizing neighborhood groups and \\"community\\" or \\"ACORN schools\\". In Chicago, ACORN has advocated for a certified teacher to be in every classroom. In California, ACORN has documented the need for textbooks and school repairs. ACORN works with teachers unions to gain funding for school construction and more funding for schools. ACORN also supports school reform and the \\"creation of alternative public schools\\" such as charter schools. ACORN opposed the privatization of some NYC schools, favoring its own Charter School plan. The ACORN model for schools emphasizes small classes, parent involvement, qualified teachers and \\"community-oriented curricula\\". =Voter registration= Since the 1980s, ACORN conducted large-scale voter registration drives,Christopher Hayes, The Nation, September 1, 2008, Obama's Voter-registration Drive focusing primarily on registering poor and minority citizens.\\"Furor over ACORN allegations gaining momentum\\" Miami Herald, 2008-10-24. In addition to conducting voter registration drives, ACORN worked to remove obstacles to voter registration. In 2006, it brought a lawsuit in federal court in Ohio against the Ohio Secretary of State, at that time Ken Blackwell, and the Director of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, alleging that, during the period that included the 2004 United States election voting controversies, the defendants had committed multiple violations of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. The district court dismissed the case, but that decision was reversed in 2008 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The parties agreed to a settlement, under which the defendants agreed to implement several measures to facilitate registration of low-income voters to bring the state into compliance with the National Voting Rights Act. =Gun control= In 2006, ACORN intervened on behalf of Jersey City, New Jersey, in a lawsuit brought against the city challenging a local ordinance that limited individuals' handgun purchases to one gun a month. The Hudson County Superior Court struck down the ordinance on the grounds that it violated the New Jersey Constitution's Equal Protection clause, and a state statute prohibiting towns and municipalities from enacting firearms legislation. On September 29, 2008, the New Jersey Superior Court Appellate Division denied ACORN's appeal of the Hudson County Superior Court's decision striking down Jersey City's ordinance. =Home Defender Program= In 2009, ACORN advocated allowing homeowners delinquent in their mortgage payments to remain in their homes pending a government solution to the housing foreclosure crisis. ACORN introduced a program called the Home Defender Program, intended to mobilize people to congregate at homes faced with foreclosure to \\"defend a family's right to stay in their homes.\\" One ACORN Web page advocated civil disobedience against foreclosure evictions stating that people in foreclosed homes should refuse to leave, and in some cases, move back in.  Legal issues  During the 2008 election season, ACORN gathered over 1.3 million voter registration forms in 21 states. Project Vote estimated that 400,000 registrations collected by ACORN were ultimately rejected, the vast majority for being duplicate registrations submitted by citizens. Project Vote estimated that only a few percent of registrations were fraudulent, based on past years and samples from some drives in 2008. Project Vote estimated that 450,000 of the registrations collected by ACORN represented first-time voters, while the remainder were address changes submitted by citizens updating their addresses. ACORN has fired employees for fraudulent registration practices and turned them over to authorities.Sheffield, Reggie. \\"Former temp worker accused of bogus registrations\\" , The Patriot-News (Harrisburg, Penn.), July 24, 2008 Of 26,513 registrations submitted by ACORN over a nine-month period in San Diego County, California, 4,655 were initially flagged, but 2,806 of those were later validated. County officials said this resulted in a 7% error rate by ACORN, compared to usually less than 5% for voter drives by other organizations. In a 2007 case in Washington state, in which seven temporary employees of ACORN were charged with submitting fraudulent voter registrations, ACORN agreed to pay King County $25,000 for its investigative costs and acknowledged that the national organization could be subject to criminal prosecution if fraud occurred.Vote Sign-up Fraud Probed; Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, August 7, 2008 In May 2009, six ACORN employees in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pleaded guilty to charges of a combined total of 51 counts of forgery and other violations while registering voters during the 2008 election cycle. In plea deals in a 2009 Las Vegas case, former ACORN field director Amy Busefink and ACORN official Christopher Edwards pleaded guilty to \\"conspiracy to commit the crime of compensation for registration of voters,\\" in connection with a quota system for paid registration staff. Edwards was sentenced to a year's probation and agreed to testify for prosecutors in charges against ACORN and against Busefink. Busefink appealed her case to the Nevada Supreme Court, challenging the constitutionality of the statute.ACORN pleads guilty to felony compensation for registration of voters; Las Vegas Journal-Review; April 6, 2011 In April 2011, ACORN entered a guilty plea to one count of felony compensation for registration of voters, for which they were fined $5000, but did not concede that the law was constitutional. ACORN International ACORN International was created in 2004 as an offshoot of ACORN to aid the spread of ACORN's model to other countries,D. Beck and R. Purcell, International community organising (Bristol: Policy Press, 2013) including Argentina, Canada, Mexico, and Peru. The first ACORN branch in the UK opened in Bristol in 2014 by three people, two of whom were graduates of the Community Organisers programme. Other groups are affiliated with ACORN: for example, Living Rent in Scotland and Alliance Citoyenne in France.

General concepts Typically, a server is a computer application, such as a web server, that runs on a remote server, reachable from a user's local computer, smartphone, or other device. Operations may be performed server-side because they require access to information or functionality that is not available on the client, or because performing such operations on the client side would be slow, unreliable, or insecure. Client and server programs may be commonly available ones such as free or commercial web servers and web browsers, communicating with each other using standardized protocols. Or, programmers may write their own server, client, and communications protocol which can only be used with one another. Server-side operations include both those that are carried out in response to client requests, and non-client-oriented operations such as maintenance tasks. Computer security In a computer security context, server-side vulnerabilities or attacks refer to those that occur on a server computer system, rather than on the client side, or in between the two. For example, an attacker might exploit a SQL injection vulnerability in a web application in order to maliciously change or gain unauthorized access to data in the server's database. Alternatively, an attacker might break into a server system using vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system and then be able to access database and other files in the same manner as authorized administrators of the server. Examples In the case of distributed computing projects such as SETI@home and the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, while the bulk of the operations occur on the client side, the servers are responsible for coordinating the clients, sending them data to analyze, receiving and storing results, providing reporting functionality to project administrators, etc. In the case of an Internet-dependent user application like Google Earth, while querying and display of map data takes place on the client side, the server is responsible for permanent storage of map data, resolving user queries into map data to be returned to the client, etc. In the context of the World Wide Web, commonly encountered server-side computer languages include: * C# or Visual Basic in ASP.NET environments * Java * Perl * PHP * Python * Ruby * Node.js * Swift However, web applications and services can be implemented in almost any language, as long as they can return data to standards-based web browsers (possibly via intermediary programs) in formats which they can use.

Over nearly half its length (2069 m), between the Rue du Faubourg du Temple and the Place de la Bastille, it was covered, in the mid-19th century, to create wide boulevards and public spaces on the surface. The canal is drained and cleaned every 10‚Äì15 years, and it is always a source of fascination for Parisians to discover curiosities and even some treasures among the hundreds of tonnes of discarded objects. History Gaspard de Chabrol, prefect of Paris, proposed building a canal from the river Ourcq, 100 km northeast of Paris, to supply the city with fresh water to support a growing population and help avoid diseases such as dysentery and cholera, while also supplying fountains and allowing the streets to be cleaned. Construction of the canal was ordered by Napoleon I in 1802 and construction took place until 1825, funded by a new tax on wine. The canal was also used to supply Paris with grain, building materials and other goods, carried on canal boats. Two ports were created on the canal in Paris to unload the boats: Port de l'Arsenal and the Bassin de la Villette. By the 1960s, traffic had dwindled to a trickle and the canal narrowly escaped being filled in and paved over for a highway. Route The entrance to the canal from the vast terminal basin (Bassin de la Villette) of the Canal de l'Ourcq is at a double lock near the Place de Stalingrad. Continuing towards the river Seine, the canal is bordered by the Quai de Valmy on the right bank and the Quai de Jemmapes on the left, passing through three more double staircase locks before disappearing under the three successive vo√ªtes (tunnels) ‚Äì du Temple, Richard- Lenoir and Bastille ‚Äì to emerge in the Port de l'Arsenal, the principal port for boats visiting and residing in Paris. Tourism Today, the canal is a popular destination for Parisians and tourists. Some take cruises on the canal in passenger boats. Others watch the barges and other boats navigate the series of locks and pass under the attractive cast-iron footbridges. There are many popular restaurants and bars along the open part of the canal, which is also popular with students. M√©tro stations The canal can be accessed from the following Paris M√©tro stations: Stalingrad, R√©publique, Goncourt, (Paris M√©tro) Jacques Bonsergent, Jaur√®s. In popular culture Art View of the Canal Saint-Martin (Alfred Sisley, Orsay Museum, 1870) The canal inspired painters such as Alfred Sisley (1839-1899). In the present day, many intricate works of graffiti are visible along the canal, and there is a large multimedia art space on its banks at the former municipal undertakers building at 104 rue d'Aubervilliers ('104'). Film and television * The canal was the setting in part for Jean Vigo's film L'Atalante in 1934. * The canal is shown in the 1938 film H√¥tel du Nord, directed by Marcel Carn√©.However, the film was shot in the studios of Boulogne-Billancourt where the scenery of the canal was rebuilt by Alexandre Trauner. *In Les Malheurs d'Alfred (1972), Pierre Richard and Anny Duperey meet each other at the beginning of the film, thinking of committing suicide in the canal. * The canal appears in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's famous 2001 film known in English as Am√©lie, in which the title character is shown enjoying one of her favourite activities: skipping stones at the locks of the canal. * The canal was used as an escape route for Ethan Hunt and his team in the 2018 film Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Fallout.

History  Seven Arts Productions acquired Jack L. Warner's controlling interest in Warner Bros. Pictures for $32 million in November 1966. The merger between two companies was completed by July 1967, and the combined company was named Warner Bros.-Seven Arts. The acquisition included the black and white Looney Tunes (plus the non-Harman and Ising Merrie Melodies) library, Warner Bros. Records (which was renamed Warner Bros.-Seven Arts Records), and Reprise Records. Later that same year, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts purchased Atlantic Records. Those record labels were combined in 1971 with two other acquisitions (Elektra Records and its sister label Nonesuch Records) in a new holding company, Warner-Elektra-Atlantic, under the direction of Mo Ostin and Joe Smith. The head of production was Kenneth Hyman, son of Seven Arts co-founder Eliot Hyman. The first film of production and distribution was Reflections in a Golden Eye. Cool Hand Luke was the final film produced by Warner Bros. Pictures before and after changing its name studio.  Acquisition by Kinney  Warner Bros.-Seven Arts was acquired in 1969 by Kinney National Company. In April 1970, Kinney deleted \\"Seven Arts\\" from the company name, and reestablishing it as Warner Bros. Due to a financial scandal over its parking operations, Kinney National spun off its non-entertainment assets in September 1971 as National Kinney Corporation, and changed its name to Warner Communications Inc. on February 10, 1972. Warner Bros.-Seven Arts subsequently went defunct. It released its final production, Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed, in February 1970. The studio's next film, Woodstock, which was released in March, was credited as a Warner Bros. production, and this credit would be applied to all other productions from the studio afterward. However, The Phynx, which was released in May 1970, was the last film made by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts as creditor.

Krapina has been known since 1193. It has always been a favorite site for castles and country houses of Croatian and Hungarian rulers. In the first half of the 15th century, it was an important center of the Counts of Celje, who additionally fortified the town and expanded the nearby castle. Later, it came in the possession of the Kegleviƒá family. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Krapina was a district capital in the Vara≈ædin County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. In 1899, on a hill called Hu≈°njakovo near modern Krapina, the archaeologist and paleontologist Dragutin Gorjanoviƒá- Kramberger found over eight hundred fossil remains belonging to Neanderthals. The half-cave in Krapina was soon listed among the world\`s science localities as a rich fossil finding site, where the largest and richest collection of the Neanderthal man had ever been found. In the sandy deposits of the cave about nine hundred remains of fossilised human bones were found - the fossil remains belonged to several dozen different individuals, of different sex, from 2 to 40 years of age. Culture Krapina Neanderthal Museum Krapina is home to the yearly Festival kajkavske popevke (The festival of kajkavian song) sung in the local Kajkavian language.Official Website of Kajkavske popevke At the site where the Neanderthals remains were discovered there is now a state-of-the-art Neanderthal museum which also includes an extensive section on evolution, making it one of the most interesting evolutionary museums in Europe. It is surrounded by a park with many statues of Neanderthals and the game they hunted, a bear, a moose and a beaver set in the actual locations. There is also a nearby municipality of Krapinske Toplice (Krapina spa) with numerous thermal springs and spa tourist infrastructure. Krapina is also the birthplace of the linguist and language reformer Ljudevit Gaj. His home is now a museum where visitors can learn about his life and work.

The acorn, or oaknut, is the nut of the oaks and their close relatives (genera Quercus and Lithocarpus, in the family Fagaceae). It usually contains a single seed (occasionally two seeds), enclosed in a tough, leathery shell, and borne in a cup-shaped cupule. Acorns are long and broad. Acorns take between 6 and 24 months (depending on the species) to mature; see the list of Quercus species for details of oak classification, in which acorn morphology and phenology are important factors. Etymology The word acorn (earlier akerne, and acharn) is related to the Gothic name akran, which had the sense of \\"fruit of the unenclosed land\\". The word was applied to the most important forest produce, that of the oak. Chaucer spoke of \\"achornes of okes\\" in the 14th century. By degrees, popular etymology connected the word both with \\"corn\\" and \\"oak-horn\\", and the spelling changed accordingly. This cites the New English Dictionary, now the Oxford English Dictionary The current spelling (emerged 15c.-16c.), derives from association with ac (Old English: \\"oak\\") + corn. Ecological role Acorns play an important role in forest ecology when oaks are the dominant species or are plentiful. The volume of the acorn crop may vary widely, creating great abundance or great stress on the many animals dependent on acorns and the predators of those animals. Acorns, along with other nuts, are termed mast. Wildlife that consume acorns as an important part of their diets include birds, such as jays, pigeons, some ducks, and several species of woodpeckers. Small mammals that feed on acorns include mice, squirrels and several other rodents. Acorns have a large influence on small rodents in their habitats, as large acorn yields help rodent populations to grow. Ponies eating acorns. Acorns can cause painful death in equines, especially if eaten to excess. Large mammals such as pigs, bears, and deer also consume large amounts of acorns; they may constitute up to 25% of the diet of deer in the autumn. In Spain, Portugal and the New Forest region of southern England, pigs are still turned loose in dehesas (large oak groves) in the autumn, to fill and fatten themselves on acorns. Heavy consumption of acorns can, on the other hand, be toxic to other animals that cannot detoxify their tannins, such as horses and cattle. The larvae of some moths and weevils also live in young acorns, consuming the kernels as they develop.Brown, Leland R. (1979) Insects Feeding on California Oak Treesin Proceedings of the Symposium on Multiple-Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources, Timothy Plum and Norman Pillsbury (eds.). Acorns are attractive to animals because they are large and thus efficiently consumed or cached. Acorns are also rich in nutrients. Percentages vary from species to species, but all acorns contain large amounts of protein, carbohydrates and fats, as well as the minerals calcium, phosphorus and potassium, and the vitamin niacin. Total food energy in an acorn also varies by species, but all compare well with other wild foods and with other nuts. Acorns also contain bitter tannins, the amount varying with the species. Since tannins, which are plant polyphenols, interfere with an animal's ability to metabolize protein, creatures must adapt in different ways to use the nutritional value acorns contain. Animals may preferentially select acorns that contain fewer tannins. When the tannins are metabolized in cattle, the tannic acid produced can cause ulceration and kidney failure. Animals that cache acorns, such as jays and squirrels, may wait to consume some of these acorns until sufficient groundwater has percolated through them to leach out the tannins. Other animals buffer their acorn diet with other foods. Many insects, birds, and mammals metabolize tannins with fewer ill effects than do humans. Species of acorn that contain large amounts of tannins are very bitter, astringent, and potentially irritating if eaten raw. This is particularly true of the acorns of American red oaks and English oaks. The acorns of white oaks, being much lower in tannins, are nutty in flavor; this characteristic is enhanced if the acorns are given a light roast before grinding. Tannins can be removed by soaking chopped acorns in several changes of water, until the water no longer turns brown. Cold water leaching can take several days, but three to four changes of boiling water can leach the tannins in under an hour. Hot water leaching (boiling) cooks the starch of the acorn, which would otherwise act like gluten in flour, helping it bind to itself. For this reason, if the acorns will be used to make flour, then cold water leaching is preferred. Being rich in fat, acorn flour can spoil or molder easily and must be carefully stored. Acorns are also sometimes prepared as a massage oil. Acorns of the white oak group, Leucobalanus, typically start rooting as soon as they are in contact with the soil (in the fall), then send up the leaf shoot in the spring. =Dispersal agents= Sprouting acorn of Quercus robur. Acorns are too heavy for wind dispersal, so they require other ways to spread. Oaks therefore depend on biological seed dispersal agents to move the acorns beyond the mother tree and into a suitable area for germination (including access to adequate water, sunlight and soil nutrients), ideally a minimum of from the parent tree. Many animals eat unripe acorns on the tree or ripe acorns from the ground, with no reproductive benefit to the oak, but some animals, such as squirrels and jays serve as seed dispersal agents. Jays and squirrels that scatter-hoard acorns in caches for future use effectively plant acorns in a variety of locations in which it is possible for them to germinate and thrive. Even though jays and squirrels retain remarkably large mental maps of cache locations and return to consume them, the odd acorn may be lost, or a jay or squirrel may die before consuming all of its stores. A small number of acorns manage to germinate and survive, producing the next generation of oaks. Scatter-hoarding behavior depends on jays and squirrels associating with plants that provide good packets of food that are nutritionally valuable, but not too big for the dispersal agent to handle. The beak sizes of jays determine how large acorns may get before jays ignore them. Acorns germinate on different schedules, depending on their place in the oak family. Once acorns sprout, they are less nutritious, as the seed tissue converts to the indigestible lignins that form the root. Uses In some cultures, acorns once constituted a dietary staple, though they have largely been replaced by grains and are now typically considered a relatively unimportant food, except in some Native American and Korean communities. Several cultures have devised traditional acorn-leaching methods, sometimes involving specialized tools, that were traditionally passed on to their children by word of mouth. =As food= Acorns served an important role in early human history and were a source of food for many cultures around the world. For instance, the Ancient Greek lower classes and the Japanese (during the J≈çmon period) would eat acorns, especially in times of famine. In ancient Iberia they were a staple food, according to Strabo. Despite this history, acorns rarely form a large part of modern diets and are not currently cultivated on scales approaching that of many other nuts. However, if properly prepared (by selecting high-quality specimens and leaching out the bitter tannins in water), acorn meal can be used in some recipes calling for grain flours. In antiquity, Pliny the Elder noted that acorn flour could be used to make bread. Varieties of oak differ in the amount of tannin in their acorns. Varieties preferred by American Indians such as Quercus kelloggii (California black oak) may be easier to prepare or more palatable. In Korea, an edible jelly named dotorimuk is made from acorns, and dotori guksu are Korean noodles made from acorn flour or starch. In the 17th century, a juice extracted from acorns was administered to habitual drunkards to cure them of their condition or else to give them the strength to resist another bout of drinking. Acorns have frequently been used as a coffee substitute, particularly when coffee was unavailable or rationed. The Confederates in the American Civil War and Germans during World War II (when it was called Ersatz coffee), which were cut off from coffee supplies by Union and Allied blockades respectively, are particularly notable past instances of this use of acorns. =Use by Native Americans= Mortar holes for pounding acorns into flour, Lost Lake, California Chuckachancy women pause in their work preparing acorns for grinding, California, ca. 1920 Acorns were a traditional food of many indigenous peoples of North America, and served an especially important role for Californian Native Americans, where the ranges of several species of oaks overlap, increasing the reliability of the resource. One ecology researcher of Yurok and Karuk heritage reports that \\"his traditional acorn preparation is a simple soup, cooked with hot stones directly in a basket,\\" and says he enjoys acorns eaten with \\"grilled salmon, huckleberries or seaweed.\\" Unlike many other plant foods, acorns do not need to be eaten or processed right away, but may be stored for a long time, much as squirrels do. In years that oaks produced many acorns, Native Americans sometimes collected enough acorns to store for two years as insurance against poor acorn production years. After drying them in the sun to discourage mold and germination, women took acorns back to their villages and cached them in hollow trees or structures on poles, to keep them safe from mice and squirrels. The stored acorns could then be used when needed, particularly during the winter when other resources were scarce. Those acorns that germinated in the fall were shelled and pulverized before those that germinate in spring. Because of their high fat content, stored acorns can become rancid. Molds may also grow on them. The lighting of ground fires killed the larvae of acorn moths and acorn weevils by burning them during their dormancy period in the soil. The pests can infest and consume more than 95% of an oak's acorns. Fires also released the nutrients bound in dead leaves and other plant debris into the soil, thus fertilizing oak trees while clearing the ground to make acorn collection easier. Most North American oaks tolerate light fires, especially when consistent burning has eliminated woody fuel accumulation around their trunks. Consistent burning encouraged oak growth at the expense of other trees less tolerant of fire, thus keeping oaks dominant in the landscapes. Oaks produce more acorns when they are not too close to other oaks and thus competing with them for sunlight, water and soil nutrients. The fires tended to eliminate the more vulnerable young oaks and leave old oaks which created open oak savannas with trees ideally spaced to maximize acorn production. =In culture= Art A motif in Roman architecture, also popular in Celtic and Scandinavian art, the acorn symbol is used as an ornament on cutlery, furniture, and jewelry; it also appears on finials at Westminster Abbey. Contemporary use as symbol The acorn is the symbol for the National Trails of England and Wales, and is used for the waymarks on these paths. The acorn, specifically that of the white oak, is also present in the symbol for the University of Connecticut. Acorns are also used as charges in heraldry.

Tunner was known for his expertise in the command of large-scale military airlift operations, first in Air Transport Command (ATC) during World War II, commanding The Hump operation, and later in Military Air Transport Service (MATS) during the Berlin Airlift in 1949‚Äì1951. He eventually rose to the rank of Lieutenant general and commanded MATS itself. Tunner appointed Nancy Love to the staff of his first major command in 1942 and was a key figure in the planning and creation of the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Service. Military career =Air Corps= Tunner entered the United States Military Academy on July 1, 1924, appointed from the 5th District of New Jersey by United States Representative Ernest R. Ackerman. He was commissioned on June 9, 1928, as a second lieutenant of field artillery, then selected the Air Corps as his branch of service, commissioned 2nd lieutenant AC on September 8, 1928, when he entered flight training at Brooks Field, Texas. At the Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field, he received his final flight check from Capt. Claire Chennault and was awarded his pilot's wings in September 1929. His first assignment was to Rockwell Field, California, as a pilot in the 11th Bombardment Squadron of the 7th Bomb Group, flying a bi-wing Keystone LB-5 bomber. There he was introduced to transport aircraft, ferrying a Fokker tri- motor to Sacramento with passengers aboard. In October 1931 he was assigned to Randolph Field as a flying instructor, but was ill-suited to the task. After a board of review, Tunner was assigned to squadron officer duties during his tour so that he could continue flying. He was promoted to first lieutenant on July 1, 1934. In January 1935 he transferred to France Field, Panama Canal Zone, as a pilot with the 7th Observation Squadron. Again he worked a variety of staff duties in his squadron and as assistant operations officer of the 19th Composite Wing, advancing to the temporary rank of captain on September 26, 1935. In February 1937, back in his permanent rank of 1st lieutenant, he returned to the United States as adjutant at Lawson Field, Georgia, and as an observation pilot with the 16th Observation Squadron, which performed duties as the school squadron for the Infantry School at Fort Benning. He was promoted to the permanent rank of captain on June 9, 1938. Tunner attended the third Air Corps Tactical School \\"short course\\" in 1939, followed by his first command, the tiny Memphis Air Corps Detachment of the 1st Military Department, largely a recruiting billet. On January 31, 1941, he was promoted to major and began duties in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps (OCAC) at Washington, D.C., in the Personnel Division, assigning himself collateral flying duties at nearby Bolling Field. =Army Air Forces= Prior to World War II on June 8, 1941, Major Tunner became a key figure in the creation of what became the Air Transport Command (ATC) when he was the second staff officer selected by Col. Robert Olds for the headquarters of the new Air Corps Ferrying Command. He advanced from adjutant and personnel officer of ACFC to executive officer on November 26. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on January 5, 1942, and full colonel on March 1, 1942. He was thus in a key position when ACFC, originally intended to deliver aircraft from factory to their point of embarkation overseas, had its name and mission changed under its second commander, Brig. Gen. Harold George, to support of U.S. and Allied operations worldwide by aerial transportation of supplies, personnel, and equipment using multi-engine aircraft. The first wartime organizational tables for ACFC (officially the Army Air Forces Ferrying Command after February 1942), were drawn up by Tunner, who organized and became commander of its Domestic Division on April 1, 1942. On July 1, 1942, the Domestic Division was renamed the Ferrying Division under ATC and continued its mission of aircraft delivery. Under the aegis of the Ferrying Division, Tunner was responsible for organizing the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS) in September 1942, a program of civil service female pilots to shuttle planes from factory to Army airfields. The WAFS program, developed from a plan first drawn up by Tunner's executive trouble-shooter Nancy Harkness Love, merged in August 1943 with Jacqueline Cochran's Women's Flying Training Detachment (WFTD) to become the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPS). Tunner was promoted to Brigadier general on June 30, 1943, and tapped for command of the airlift supply operation from India to China in the spring of 1944. He made an inspection trip in the CBI theater with his prospective staff in June, where he piloted a C-46 Commando over \\"The Hump\\". He went back to the CBI in August and took command of what had become the India-China Division (ATC) on September 4, 1944. Tunner's orders were to increase cargo tonnage levels flown by the airlift but also to reduce an alarmingly high accident level. Tunner incorporated four-engined Douglas C-54 Skymaster cargo planes into a second route to China called the \\"Low Hump\\" that widened the airlift corridor from 50 to 200 miles to increase efficiency.Glines, Carroll V., \\"Flying the Hump\\", AIR FORCE Magazine (March 1991) Vol. 74 No 3. He instituted maintenance and flying safety programs that reduced the deadly accident rate to less than a quarter of what it had been when he took command, despite more than doubling the tonnage and hours flown. On November 10, 1945, he returned to the United States, where he became Air Inspector of ATC on January 1, 1946. He held a series of division commands in the post-war ATC beginning February 1, 1946, and was promoted to Major general on July 10. =United States Air Force= When the Army Air Forces became the United States Air Force in September 1947, the Military Air Transport Service was formed by combining ATC and the Naval Air Transport Service. Maj. Gen. Laurence S. Kuter selected Tunner to be his deputy commander for operations in March 1948. Almost immediately, Tunner's reputation for managing airlift recommended him to bring efficiency to the Berlin Airlift. The organization of the five-week-old operation was haphazard because USAFE was a tactical organization without experience in running transport operations, trying to feed the city using 54 C-54 Skymasters supplemented by a section of C-47 Skytrains, basically using bomber operation methods. On July 22, 1948, the National Security Council met with European commander Gen. Lucius D. Clay and concluded that expansion of the operation was essential. Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg immediately appointed Tunner to the job, and he arrived in Wiesbaden, Germany, on July 28, 1948. By mid-August Tunner had added 72 C-54s to the effort and brought in two-thirds of all USAF C-54 aircrews worldwide to fly the airlift 24 hours a day. Tunner brought such a level of organization to the Berlin operation that the per-day tonnage brought into Berlin by the planes eventually exceeded the amount of material that had been brought in by train. Unfortunately for Tunner, much of the credit for the success of the airlift, and the innovations that led to that success, were given to General Curtis LeMay, the Air Force commander in Europe until October 1948.Cherny, Andrei, The Candy Bombers: The Untold Story of the Berlin Airlift and America's Finest Hour, New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, , (2008) The airlift program was gradually wound down as squadrons were broken up and reassigned to their regular MATS duties. Tunner returned to his post in MATS on September 5, 1949. The outbreak of the Korean War took him to Tokyo, Japan, to command a new airlift organization in the Far East Air Forces, Combat Cargo Command (Provisional) on September 10, 1950. Combat Cargo Command had the initial job of providing the airlift for the Inchon invasion and subsequent airborne operations. Tunner's success in meeting the commitments is attested to by the Distinguished Service Cross awarded him on the spot by General Douglas MacArthur. Combat Cargo Command was discontinued on January 25, 1951, when a permanent organization, 315th Air Division, was activated. In its four-and-a-half months under \\"Tonnage Tunner\\", it had made 32,632 sorties; delivered 130,170 tons of cargo; carried 155,294 passengers including paratroopers; and evacuated 72,960 casualties. In February 1951 Tunner was assigned to the Air Material Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, as deputy commander. In 1953, he was appointed commander, United States Air Forces in Europe, a post he held four years during the buildup of NATO air forces. In 1957, he was reassigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force as deputy chief of staff for operations. On July 1, 1958, concurrently with the assumption by the Military Air Transport Service of the \\"Single Managership for Airlift\\", he returned to the air transport field as commander, MATS, with headquarters at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. He became a prime and impassioned spokesman for the development and deployment of the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter as the primary jet airlift transport for MATS, and supported the election of John F. Kennedy as president to achieve that end when the Eisenhower administration rejected it. Tunner retired from the Air Force on May 31, 1960. =Legacy= The Lieutenant General William H. Tunner Award is awarded annually by the commander of the Air Mobility Command to the \\"outstanding strategic airlift crew\\" in the United States Air Force. In 1997 the USAF began procurement of the 60K Tunner Materiel Handling Equipment (MHE), a diesel-driven aircraft loader built by Systems & Electronics, Inc. for loading and unloading wide-body cargo transports, designed to be deployed by C-5, C-17 and C-141 transports. It has the capability to load and unload the C-130, C-141, C-5 and C-17, as well as the commercial DC-10, L-1011 and B-747 freighters. The equipment was named to honor Tunner by an industry naming contest. First recipient of the Airlift/Tanker Association Hall of Fame Award in 1989. A street in the Berlin borough of Steglitz-Zehlendorf is named after him. Personal biography Tunner was the fourth of five children of immigrants from Leoben, Austria. His ancestors Peter Tunner the Elder (1786-1844) and Peter Tunner (1809-1897) were metallurgists, mining specialists and montanists who co-founded Austria's famous \\"Bergakademie\\" (Mining Academy) at Leoben.Tunner, Over the hump (1964, reprint 1998), Kap.1: Early days, p.5 His father was an engineer as well and settled in Roselle, New Jersey, where Tunner was raised.Staff. \\"Tunner New India-China ATC Leader\\", The Command Post, September 8, 1944.

They had two sons, Joseph C. and Dr. William H. Tunner, Jr. Sarah was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor following surgery on November 12, 1945, and remained in a coma for a year and a half. After her death in 1947, Tunner married a former WASP pilot, Margaret Ann (Ann) Hamilton of Enid, Oklahoma in 1951, and had a daughter, Hamilton Suzanne Tunner Hudson.

Circa 1860 Penny dreadfuls were cheap popular serial literature produced during the nineteenth century in the United Kingdom. The pejorative term is roughly interchangeable with penny horrible, penny awful, and penny blood.Many people use the term \\"penny blood\\" interchangeably with \\"penny dreadful\\". Sally Powell distinguishes between these terms, however, and designates \\"penny bloods\\" as cheap sensational literature written largely for working-class adults. Powell, p. 46 The term typically referred to a story published in weekly parts, each costing one penny. The subject matter of these stories was typically sensational, focusing on the exploits of detectives, criminals, or supernatural entities. First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls featured characters such as Sweeney Todd, Dick Turpin and Varney the Vampire. The Guardian described penny dreadfuls as \\"Britain‚Äôs first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.\\" While the term \\"penny dreadful\\" was originally used in reference to a specific type of literature circulating in mid-Victorian Britain, it came to encompass a variety of publications that featured cheap sensational fiction, such as story papers and booklet \\"libraries\\". The penny dreadfuls were printed on cheap wood pulp paper and were aimed at young working class men. More than a million boys‚Äô periodicals were sold a week, but the popularity of penny dreadfuls was challenged in the 1890s by the rise of competing literature, especially the half-penny periodicals published by Alfred Harmsworth. Origins Crime broadsides were commonly sold at public executions in the United Kingdom in the 18th and 19th centuries. These were often produced by printers who specialised in them. They were typically illustrated by a crude picture of the crime, a portrait of the criminal, or a generic woodcut of a hanging taking place. There would be a written account of the crime and of the trial and often the criminal's confession of guilt. A doggerel verse warning others to not follow the executed person's example, to avoid their fate, was another common feature. Victorian-era Britain experienced social changes that resulted in increased literacy rates. With the rise of capitalism and industrialisation, people began to spend more money on entertainment, contributing to the popularisation of the novel. Improvements in printing resulted in newspapers such as Joseph Addison's The Spectator and Richard Steele's The Tatler, and England's more fully recognizing the singular concept of reading as a form of leisure; it was, of itself, a new industry. Other significant changes included industrialisation and an increased capacity for travel via the invention of tracks, engines, and the corresponding railway distribution (the first public railway, Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in 1825). These changes created both a market for cheap popular literature and the ability for it to be circulated on a large scale. The first penny serials were published in the 1830s to meet this demand. Between 1830 and 1850 there were up to 100 publishers of penny-fiction, in addition to many magazines which embraced the genre.Flanders, Judith (15 May 2014). ‚ÄúPenny dreadfuls‚Äù. British Library. Retrieved 6 February 2019 The serials were priced to be affordable to working-class readers, and were considerably cheaper than the serialised novels of authors such as Charles Dickens, which cost a shilling [twelve pennies] per part.\\"Was Dickens Really Paid By The Word?\\". The University of Santa Cruz. Retrieved 27 September 2017 Subject matter Cover of a Varney the Vampire publication (1845) The stories themselves were reprints, or sometimes rewrites, of the earliest Gothic thrillers such as The Castle of Otranto or The Monk, as well as new stories about famous criminals. The first ever Penny Blood, published in 1836, was called Lives of the Most Notorious Highwaymen, Footpads, &c.; The story continued over 60 issues, each eight pages of tightly-packed text with one half-page illustration. Some of the most famous of these penny part-stories were The String of Pearls: A Romance (introducing Sweeney Todd, \\"the Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\"), The Mysteries of London (inspired by the French serial The Mysteries of Paris), and Varney the Vampire (1845‚Äì47). Varney is the tale of the vampire Sir Francis Varney, and introduced many of the tropes present in vampire fiction recognizable to modern audiences ‚Äî it was the first story to refer to sharpened teeth for a vampire.\\"Did Vampires Not Have Fangs in Movies Until the 1950s?\\". Huffington Post. Retrieved 27 September 2017 Highwaymen were popular heroes; Black Bess or the Knight of the Road, outlining the largely imaginary exploits of real-life English highwayman Dick Turpin, continued for 254 episodes and was well over 2,000 pages long. Turpin was not executed until page 2,207. Some lurid stories purported to be based on fact: Spring-Heeled Jack was what we would now call an urban myth. The first ‚Äòsighting‚Äô of him was in 1837, and he was described as having a terrifying and frightful appearance, with diabolical physiognomy, clawed hands and eyes that ‚Äòresembled red balls of fire‚Äô. He was mainly sighted in London, but popped up elsewhere, and seems to have been a source of frightened fascination for several decades. At the height of Spring-Heeled Jack hysteria, several women reported being attacked by a clawed monster of a man breathing blue flames. The last ‚Äòsighting‚Äô was in Liverpool in 1904. Other serials were thinly-disguised plagiarisms of popular contemporary literature. The publisher Edward Lloyd, for instance, published a number of hugely successful penny serials derived from the works of Charles Dickens, such as Oliver Twiss and Nickelas Nicklebery. Sweeney Todd murdering a victim in The String of Pearls (1846‚Äì47) The illustration which featured at the start of each issue was an integral part of the dreadfuls‚Äô appeal, often acting as a teaser for future instalments. As one reader said, ‚ÄúYou see‚Äôs an engraving of a man hung up, burning over a fire, and some [would] go mad if they couldn‚Äôt learn‚Ä¶ all about him.‚Äù No wonder one publisher‚Äôs rallying cry to his illustrators was ‚Äúmore blood ‚Äì much more blood!‚ÄùFlanders, Judith. ‚ÄúPenny dreadfuls‚Äù. British Library. Retrieved 11 March 2020 Working class boys who could not afford a penny a week often formed clubs that would share the cost, passing the flimsy booklets from reader to reader. Other enterprising youngsters would collect a number of consecutive parts, then rent the volume out to friends. In 1866, Boys of England was introduced as a new type of publication, an eight-page magazine that featured serial stories as well as articles and shorts of interest.Christopher Banham, \\"England and America Against the World\\": Empire and the USE in Edwin J. Brett's Boys of England, 1866-99, Victorian Periodicals Review, 40:2, 2007, pp.151-71 Numerous competitors quickly followed, with such titles as Boys' Leisure Hour, Boys' Standard, Young Men of Great Britain, etc. As the price and quality of other types of fiction works were the same, these also fell under the general definition of penny dreadfuls. Appearing in the 1860s, American dime novels were edited and rewritten for a British audience. These appeared in booklet form, such as the Boy's First Rate Pocket Library. Frank Reade, Buffalo Bill, and Deadwood Dick were all popular with the penny dreadful audience. The penny dreadfuls were influential since they were, in the words of one commentator, \\"the most alluring and low-priced form of escapist reading available to ordinary youth, until the advent in the early 1890s of future newspaper magnate Alfred Harmsworth's price-cutting 'halfpenny dreadfuller'\\". In reality, the serial novels were overdramatic and sensational, but generally harmless. If anything, the penny dreadfuls, although obviously not the most enlightening or inspiring of literary selections, resulted in increasingly literate youth in the Industrial period. The wide circulation of this sensationalist literature, however, contributed to an ever-greater fear of crime in mid-Victorian Britain. Decline British publishing magnate Alfred Harmsworth developed popular journalism intended for the working class The popularity of penny dreadfuls was challenged in the 1890s by the rise of competing literature. Leading the challenge were popular periodicals published by Alfred Harmsworth. Priced at one half-penny, Harmsworth's story papers were cheaper and, at least initially, were more respectable than the competition. Harmsworth claimed to be motivated by a wish to challenge the pernicious influence of penny dreadfuls. According to an editorial in the first number of The Half-penny Marvel in 1893: > It is almost a daily occurrence with magistrates to have before them boys > who, having read a number of 'dreadfuls', followed the examples set forth in > such publications, robbed their employers, bought revolvers with the > proceeds, and finished by running away from home, and installing themselves > in the back streets as 'highwaymen'. This and many other evils the 'penny > dreadful' is responsible for. It makes thieves of the coming generation, and > so helps fill our gaols. The Half-penny Marvel was soon followed by a number of other Harmsworth half- penny periodicals, such as The Union Jack and Pluck. At first the stories were high-minded moral tales, reportedly based on true experiences, but it was not long before these papers started using the same kind of material as the publications they competed against. A. A. Milne, the author of Winnie the Pooh, once said, \\"Harmsworth killed the penny dreadful by the simple process of producing the 'ha'penny dreadfuller'\\". The quality of the Harmsworth/Amalgamated Press papers began to improve throughout the early 20th century, however. By the time of the First World War, papers such as Union Jack dominated the market in the UK.Editorials in early issues of papers such as the Union Jack or Boys' Friend make frequent references to \\"the blood and thunders\\", but as time went on the mentions disappeared. Letters sent in by parents or teachers were frequently printed, praising the papers for putting the \\"trash\\" out of business. The penny dreadfuls were also challenged by book series such as The Penny Library of Famous Books launched in 1896 by George Newnes which he characterized as \\"penny delightfuls\\" intended to counter the pernicious effects of the penny dreadfuls,Penny Library of Famous Books, oac.cdlib.org.

Penny dreadfuls were created in the 1830s to meet this demand. The Guardian described penny dreadfuls as \\"Britain‚Äôs first taste of mass- produced popular culture for the young\\", and \\"the Victorian equivalent of video games\\". More than one million boys‚Äô periodicals were sold per week. Two popular characters to come out of the penny dreadfuls were Jack Harkaway, introduced in the Boys of England in 1871, and Sexton Blake, who began in the Half-penny Marvel in 1893.Turner, E.S.

In total, Blake appeared in roughly 4,000 adventures, right up into the 1970s. Harkaway was also popular in America and had many imitators. The fictional Sweeney Todd, the subject of both a successful musical by Stephen Sondheim and a feature film by Tim Burton, also first appeared in an 1846/1847 penny dreadful titled The String of Pearls: A Romance by James Malcolm Rymer and Thomas Peckett Prest.

Best known for his \\"super villain\\" stage persona and rhyme-dense, humorous lyrical style, Dumile has taken on several stage names in his career. MF Doom's mask, similar to that of Marvel Comics super-villain Doctor Doom, is depicted rapping on the cover of the 1999 album Operation: Doomsday. MF Doom has appeared in several collaborative projects such as Madvillain (with Madlib), Danger Doom (with Danger Mouse), Doomstarks (with Ghostface Killah), JJ Doom (with Jneiro Jarel), NehruvianDoom (with Bishop Nehru), and Czarface Meets Metal Face (with Czarface). Early life Dumile was born on 9 January 1971 in London, England, the son of Trinidadian mother and a Rhodesian father. His family moved to Long Island, New York, when he was a child; Dumile remains a British citizen and has not gained American citizenship.Coleman, Brian. \\"Check The Technique: KMD‚Äôs Black Bastards and the Birth of MF Doom\\" , Medium (website), January 30, 2015/Accessed February 19, 2017. \\"Aside from Manhattan, one geographical locale that had significance to the Dumile brothers was Long Beach, NY‚Äîa town technically in Long Island, but just outside of the Queens borough line.... Doom says that they were firmly planted in Long Beach when he was in junior high and early high school, and they also kept roots there throughout the mid-‚Äò90s.\\" Music career =1988‚Äì1993: Career beginnings with KMD= As Zev Love X he formed the group KMD in 1988 with his younger brother DJ Subroc and another MC called Rodan. When Rodan left the group, Zev found another MC, Onyx the Birthstone Kid, to replace Rodan. Artists and repertoire representative Dante Ross learned of KMD through the hip hop group 3rd Bass and signed the group to Elektra Records.Wax Poetics #9, Interview with Dante Ross Dumile and KMD's recording debut came on 3rd Bass's song \\"The Gas Face\\" from The Cactus Album, followed in 1991 with KMD's album Mr. Hood, which became a minor hit through its singles \\"Peachfuzz\\", \\"Who Me?\\" and heavy video play on cable TV's Yo! MTV Raps and Rap City. In 1993, just before the release of the second KMD album, Black Bastards, Subroc was struck by a car and killed while attempting to cross the Nassau Expressway, and that same week the group was dropped from Elektra Records. The album was shelved before it was released due to its controversial cover art, which featured a cartoon of a stereotypical pickaninny or sambo character being hanged. After the death of his brother, Dumile retreated from the hip hop scene from 1994 to 1997, living \\"damn near homeless, walking the streets of Manhattan, sleeping on benches\\". In the late 1990s, he left New York City and settled in Atlanta. According to interviews with Dumile, he was also \\"recovering from his wounds\\" and swearing revenge \\"against the industry that so badly deformed him\\". Black Bastards had become bootlegged at the time, leading to Doom's rise in the underground hip hop scene. =1997‚Äì2001: Operation Doomsday and production work= In 1997, Dumile began freestyling incognito at open-mic events at the Nuyorican Poets Caf√© in Manhattan, obscuring his face by putting a woman's stocking over his head. He meanwhile had taken on a new identity, MF Doom, patterned after and wearing a mask similar to that of Marvel Comics super-villain Doctor Doom, who is depicted rapping on the cover of the 1999 album Operation: Doomsday. The album, in an earlier incarnation, would have been called The Super M.F. Villains according to an interview published in 1998 by hip-hop music culture magazine Ego Trip. Later versions of the mask would be based on a prop mask obtained from the film Gladiator. He wore this mask while performing and isn't photographed without it, except for very short glimpses in videos such as Viktor Vaughn's \\"Mr. Clean\\", \\"?\\", and in earlier photos with KMD. Dumile released three singles on \\"Bobbito\\" Garc√≠a's Fondle 'Em Records, \\"Dead Bent\\", \\"Greenbacks\\" (1997), and \\"The M.I.C.\\" (1998). In 1999 Fondle 'Em released MF Doom's first full-length LP, Operation: Doomsday, which included these singles and their b-sides, and additional tracks. Dumile had used the spelling variant \\"M.F. Doom\\" for the singles' releases, but thereafter changed this to MF Doom. Among the collaborators on these tracks were fellow members of the Monsta Island Czars collective (The M.I.C.), for which each artist took on the persona of a monster from the Godzilla mythos. Dumile went by the alias King Geedorah, a three-headed golden dragon space monster, modeled after King Ghidorah, the Toho movie monster who was a three-headed dragon that often battled Godzilla. Some of his appearances on the LP are as, and are credited to, this persona instead of that of MF Doom. Dumile would revisit this character later under various name-spellings. In 2001, he began working with Prince Paul, co- producing MC Paul Barman's \\"Paullelujah!\\" with MikeTheMusicGuy and Phofo. In 2002, he appeared on the Sound-Ink's Colapsus collection, on a very hard to find track titled \\"Monday Nite at Fluid\\", featuring Kurious with production by King Honey, who also produced some tracks for Dumile's album Vaudeville Villain. Dumile has produced all the instrumentation tracks for his solo releases, with very few exceptions. Beginning in 2001, under the \\"Metal Fingers\\" moniker, Dumile began releasing his Special Herbs instrumentals series. Many of these beats can be heard as the instrumentation tracks throughout his body of work. A separate website catalogs for which tracks each instrumental has been used. =2002‚Äì2004: King Geedorah, Viktor Vaughn, Madvillain= In 2003, Dumile released the King Geedorah album Take Me to Your Leader. Geedorah is credited as producer, but only appears as an MC on four tracks. The majority of vocal tracks feature guest MCs, and the album features several instrumental montages of sampled vocals from old movies and TV shows‚Äîa technique employed on most of Dumile's albums. Later in 2003, Dumile released the LP Vaudeville Villain under the moniker Viktor Vaughn (another play on Doctor Doom, whose \\"real name\\" is Victor von Doom). In 2004 he released a follow-up LP under the Viktor Vaughn moniker, Venomous Villain. Later in 2004, the second MF Doom album Mm..Food was released by Minnesota-based label Rhymesayers Entertainment. Doom's first commercial breakthrough came in 2004, with the album Madvillainy, created with producer Madlib under the group name Madvillain. Released by Stones Throw Records, the album was a critical and commercial success. MF Doom was seen by mainstream audiences for the first time as Madvillain received publicity and acclaim in publications such as Rolling Stone, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The New Yorker, and Spin. A video for \\"All Caps\\" and a four-date US tour followed the release of Madvillainy. =2005‚Äì2009: Danger Doom and Ghostface collaboration= Although still an independent artist, MF Doom took a bigger step towards the mainstream in 2005 with The Mouse and the Mask, a collaboration with producer DJ Danger Mouse under the group name Danger Doom. The album, released on 11 October 2005 by Epitaph and Lex, was done in collaboration with Cartoon Network's Adult Swim and featured voice-actors and characters from its programs (mostly Aqua Teen Hunger Force). Danger Doom reached #41 on the Billboard 200. In 2005, Doom made an appearance on \\"November Has Come\\", a track on Gorillaz's 2005 album Demon Days, which reached #6 on the Billboard 200. Doom produced tracks for both of Ghostface Killah's 2006 albums Fishscale and More Fish, it was also announced that the two were working on a collaboration album together as Doomstarks, then titled Swift & Changeable. Three tracks have been released since the album was announced, \\"Angels\\", which appeared on a Nature Sounds compilation in late 2006 (another version appears on Doom's 2009 album Born Like This), \\"Victory Laps\\" and \\"Lively Hood\\" (a 2015 Adult Swim single). On March 14, 2006, Doom and producer Parallel Thought released a song called \\"Vomit\\". According to Parallel Thought, \\"Vomit\\" had been recorded before Doom reused its lyrics on \\"Vomitspit\\" on the 2004 album Mm...Food. The Madvillain song, \\"Monkey Suite\\", first appeared on the Adult Swim/Stones Throw Records compilation Chrome Children, later it appeared on Madvillainy 2: The Madlib Remix. On May 30, 2006, Adult Swim released the Danger Doom Occult Hymn EP, a digital EP, and on July 6 the same year Lex released Danger Doom Old School EP. The latter includes previously unreleased remixes by Madlib and Danger Mouse. Kidrobot and Stones Throw released an 8\\" tall Madvillain toy available to coincide with the release of the Chrome Children CD/DVD which featured a clip of a live performance of Madvillain. He continued to work with Adult Swim, doing voice-over work as Sherman the Giraffe on Perfect Hair Forever, being the voice for The Boondocks advertisements and previews and hosting their Christmas Eve 2006 programming. Following the success of Danger Doom, he signed a long term agreement with Lex in 2006.Nicola Slade, \\"Life Blood: Lex Records\\", (Record Of The Day, 11 June 2009) With the exception of a handful of guest appearances, there were no Doom releases between mid-2006 and the release of Born Like This. Doom's Born Like This was released on Lex Records on March 24, 2009. The album was Doom's first solo album to chart in the US. =2010‚Äìpresent: Key to the Kuffs, NehruvianDoom, and Czarface Meets Metal Face= In early 2010, he released the Gazzillion Ear EP on Lex which included the Thom Yorke Remix and two mixes by Jneiro Jarel. A further remix by Madvillainy featuring a voicemail message from Kanye West was released online. The release of the Gazzillion Ear EP coincided with Doom's first ever live performances outside North America. On 5 March 2010, Lex and S√≥nar presented the first Doom show in London, at The Roundhouse in Camden. The event was the first of many Doom live performances around the world between early 2010 and the present. These shows included the Lex 10th Anniversary show at The Roundhouse with Ghostface Killah and Jneiro Jarel, performances in Europe with Gorillaz, support for Portishead and performances with Jneiro Jarel at Bestival 2012. During this period, Doom released some material on labels other than Lex. On 26 May 2010, part of the Madvillain track \\"Paper Mill\\" was released as a digital single through Adult Swim. Expektoration, MF Doom's second live album, was released on 14 September 2010 through Gold Dust Media. Upon completing his European tour, Doom was refused entry into the United States. Regarding the case, he stated that \\"there's a lot of legalities\\" and that he was \\"done with the United States.\\" Doom settled in the UK and began recording an album with fellow Lex artist Jneiro Jarel, under the moniker JJ Doom.Courtney Brown, Interview with Doom, (Frank151, Issue 48 2012) Doom contributed two exclusive JJ Doom tracks to the Lex 10th Anniversary compilation album Complex Volume 1. The tracks were the Doom/Thom Yorke/Jonny Greenwood version of \\"Retarded Fren\\" and the Dave Sitek remix of \\"Rhymin Slang\\". They were released digitally in December 2011, and were subsequently released on vinyl on Record Store Day 2012. The JJ Doom album Key to the Kuffs was released on August 20, 2012, and included guest features from Damon Albarn, Beth Gibbons of Portishead, Khujo Goodie of Goodie Mob and Dungeon Family, and Boston Fielder. On August 19, 2013, an extended version of the album titled Key to the Kuffs (Butter Edition) was released, containing a bonus nine-track EP composed of new tracks and remixes. In February 2013, Ghostface Killah revealed that he and Doom were in the process of choosing tracks for a collaborative album. In August 2013, Doom appeared on the Captain Murphy track \\"Between Villains\\" from the Adult Swim Singles Program 2013 as his alter-ego Viktor Vaughn. The track also featured Earl Sweatshirt and Thundercat. The project was revealed to be an album, titled NehruvianDoom, and was released on October 7, 2014.Bishop Nehru & DOOM ‚Äì Lex Projects . Lexprojects.com (2013-08-08). Retrieved on 2014-05-12. Doom collaborated with Flying Lotus in November 2014 on the track \\"Masquatch\\", which appeared on the FlyLo FM radio station from the reissued Grand Theft Auto V. In December 2014, Ghostface Killah announced that his and Doom's long-announced collaborative album Swift & Changeable would be released in 2015. The date would later be changed to February 2016, although it has not been released. Doom was featured on The Avalanches' single \\"Frankie Sinatra\\" alongside Danny Brown in 2016. In 2017, Doom released a track under the Danger Doom alias, entitled \\"Mad Nice\\" with features from Black Thought and Vinny Price. That same year, under the moniker WestSide Doom, he and Westside Gunn released two tracks, entitled \\"Gorilla Monsoon\\" and \\"2STINGS\\". In August 2017, a compilation album, The Missing Notebook Rhymes, was announced, consisting of music from his upcoming projects, as well as songs from other artists that he is featured on. Each track would have been released digitally on the Adult Swim website per week over the course of fifteen weeks, however on 27 September 2017, this arrangement was canceled. In February 2018, Doom and Czarface released \\"Nautical Depth\\", the first single from their collaborative album, Czarface Meets Metal Face. The album was released on March 30, 2018. On 18 December, Doom and Cookin' Soul released Doom Xmas, a Christmas remix album. Doom's 2004 song \\"Rapp Snitch Knishes (feat. Mr. Fantastik)\\" achieved renewed popularity amidst the 2019 trial of Tekashi 6ix9ine. Doom was featured on Bishop Nehru's track \\"Meathead\\" in 2020. Doom took part in a collaborative track between him, Rejjie Snow and Cam O'bi called \\"Cookie Chips\\" in 2020. Use of stand-ins Dumile has used stand-ins to perform on his behalf. He claimed that he had lost weight and thus looked and sounded different,Ortiz, Edwin. (2008-10-21) MF DOOM Addresses Rumors Of Fake Performances . HipHop DX. Retrieved on 2012-11-10. before his road manager admitted the use of imposters was an intentional choice by Dumile. At one show, an impostor Doom was booed off stage before being replaced by the real artist. In an interview with The New Yorker, Dumile said that he is both the writer and director and that he \\"might send a white dude next\\", adding \\"whoever plays the character plays the character\\". In November 2019, during his performance at the Adult Swim Festival, Flying Lotus announced that he would be joined onstage by Dumile; instead, the masked figure who appeared on stage was revealed to be comedian Hannibal Buress. Dumile's involvement in the prank has not been confirmed. Personal life Dumile has lived in London since 2009. Dumile is a former follower of the Nuwaubian Nation. On 18 December 2017, he announced on Instagram that his son, King Malachi Ezekiel Dumile, born on 22 February 2003, had died.

It is known as the \\"Council in Trullo\\" because, like the Sixth Ecumenical Council, it was held in a domed hall in the Imperial Palace (œÑœÅŒøœçŒªŒøœÇ [troulos] meaning a cup or dome). Both the Fifth and the Sixth Ecumenical Councils had omitted to draw up disciplinary canons, and as this council was intended to complete both in this respect, it took the name of Quinisext. It was attended by 215 bishops, all from the Eastern Roman Empire. Basil of Gortyna in Crete, however, belonged to the Roman patriarchate and called himself papal legate, though no evidence is extant of his right to use that title. Decisions Many of the Council's canons were reiterations. It endorsed not only the six ecumenical councils already held (canon 1), but also the Apostolic Canons, the Synod of Laodicea, the Third Synod of Carthage, and the 39th Festal Letter of Athanasius (canon 2).Canons of the Council in Trullo =Ban on pre-Christian practices= The Council banned certain festivals and practices which were thought to have a pagan origin. Therefore, the Council gives some insight to historians about pre-Christian religious practices. As a consequence, neither cleric nor layman was allowed to observe the Pagan festivals of Bota, the Kalends or the Brumalia. =Ritual observance= Many of the council's canons were aimed at settling differences in ritual observance and clerical discipline in different parts of the Christian Church. Being held under Byzantine auspices, with an exclusively Eastern clergy, these overwhelmingly took the practice of the Church of Constantinople as orthodox. Armenian practices It explicitly condemned some customs of Armenian Christians ‚Äì among them using wine unmixed with water for the Eucharist (canon 32), choosing children of clergy for appointment as clergy (canon 33), and eating eggs and cheese on Saturdays and Sundays of Lent (canon 56) ‚Äì and decreed deposition for clergy and excommunication for laypeople who contravened the canons prohibiting these practices. Roman practices Likewise, it reprobated, with similar penalties, the Roman custom of not allowing married individuals to be ordained to the diaconate or priesthood unless they vowed for perpetual continence (canon 13), and fasting on Saturdays of Lent (canon 55). Without contrasting with the practice of the Roman Church, it also prescribed that the celebration of the Eucharist in Lent should only happen in Saturdays, Sundays, and the feast of the Annunciation (canon 52). Eucharist, liturgy, etc. Grapes, milk and honey were not to be offered at the altar. Whoever came to receive the Eucharist should receive in the hand by holding his hands in the form of a cross. The Eucharist was not allowed to be given to dead bodies. During the liturgy the psalms were to be sung in modest and dulcet tones, and the phrase 'who was crucified for us' was not to be added to the Trisagion. Prelates were to preach the gospel as propounded by the fathers. Priests received special instructions on how to deal with those who were not baptized and they were also given rubrics to follow on how to admit heretics to the faith. Andrew Ekonomou. Byzantine Rome and the Greek Popes. Lexington Books, 2007 =Moral guidelines for clerics and laity= In addition to these, the council also condemned clerics that had improper or illicit relations with women. It condemned simony and the charging of fees for administering the Eucharist. It enjoined those in holy orders from entering public houses, engaging in usurious practices, attending horse races in the Hippodrome, wearing unsuitable clothes or celebrating the liturgy in private homes (eukterion) without the consent of their bishops. Both clergy and laity were forbidden from gambling with dice, attending theatrical performances, or consulting soothsayers. No one was allowed to own a house of prostitution, engage in abortion, arrange hair in ornate plaits or to promote pornography. It also ordered law students at the University of Constantinople to cease wearing \\"clothing contrary to the general custom\\", which some have interpreted as a reference to transvestitism.Canon 71 Andrew Ekonomou. Byzantine Rome and the Greek Popes. Lexington Books, 2007 Acceptance The Quinisext Canons found their way into Byzantine canonical collections even in the iconoclast period (despite the approval given to images of Christ in Canon 82). They did not, however, attain a wholly equal status to the canons of earlier councils till the great canonists of the twelfth century such as Balsamon. The immediate reaction of the see of Rome was fiercely hostile, partly because two canons (13 and 55) explicitly criticized Roman practices, but more because Rome resented being expected to approve a while sheaf of new canons only retrospectively. In 711, however, Pope Constantine appears to have accepted a compromise whereby Rome accepted the validity of the canons in the East, while being allowed to continue existent western practices where these differed. Later a letter by Pope Hadrian I (dating to 785) citing Byzantine approval of the canons was misread in the West as a statement of approval by Hadrian himself. Partly in consequence of this error but also in view of their quality, Gratian (twelfth-century) cited many of the Quinisext Canons in his own great collection of canons, the Decretum. Where, however, they clashed with western canons or practice, he set them aside as representing Byzantine practice but lacking universal validity. Gratian‚Äôs work remained authoritative in the West till the first systematic Code of Catholic Canon Law, issued in 1917. (Richard Price, The Canons of the Quinisext Council, Liverpool 2020, 34-54).

It is also known as Russell's theory of descriptions (commonly abbreviated as RTD). In short, Russell argued that the syntactic form of descriptions (phrases that took the form of \\"The aardvark\\" and \\"An aardvark\\") is misleading, as it does not correlate their logical and/or semantic architecture. While descriptions may seem fairly uncontroversial phrases, Russell argued that providing a satisfactory analysis of the linguistic and logical properties of a description is vital to clarity in important philosophical debates, particularly in semantic arguments, epistemology and metaphysics. Since the first development of the theory in Russell's 1905 paper \\"On Denoting\\", RTD has been hugely influential and well-received within the philosophy of language. However, it has not been without its critics. In particular, the philosophers P. F. Strawson and Keith Donnellan have given notable, well known criticisms of the theory. Most recently, RTD has been defended by various philosophers and even developed in promising ways to bring it into harmony with generative grammar in Noam Chomsky's sense, particularly by Stephen Neale. Such developments have themselves been criticised, and debate continues. Russell viewed his theory of descriptions as a kind of analysis that is now called logical analysisDescriptions (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) or propositional analysisHerbert Hochberg, Introducing Analytic Philosophy, Walter de Gruyter, 2003, p. 107.Julia Langkau, Christian Nimtz (eds.), New Perspectives on Concepts, Rodopi, 2010, p. 236. (not to be confused with propositional calculus). Overview Bertrand Russell's theory of descriptions was initially put forth in his 1905 essay \\"On Denoting\\", published in the journal of philosophy Mind. Russell's theory is focused on the logical form of expressions involving denoting phrases, which he divides into three groups: # Denoting phrases which do not denote anything, for example \\"the current Emperor of Kentucky\\". # Phrases which denote one definite object, for example \\"the present President of the U.S.A.\\" We need not know which object the phrase refers to for it to be unambiguous, for example \\"the cutest kitten\\" is a unique individual but his or her actual identity is unknown. # Phrases which denote ambiguously, for example, \\"an Aardvark\\". Indefinite descriptions constitute Russell's third group. Descriptions most frequently appear in the standard subject‚Äìpredicate form. Russell put forward his theory of descriptions to solve a number of problems in the philosophy of language. The two major problems are (1) co-referring expressions and (2) non- referring expressions. The problem of co-referring expressions originated primarily with Gottlob Frege as the problem of informative identities. For example, if the morning star and the evening star are the same planet in the sky seen at different times of day (indeed, they are both the planet Venus: the morning star is the planet Venus seen in the morning sky and the evening star is the planet Venus seen in the evening sky), how is it that someone can think that the morning star rises in the morning but the evening star does not? This is apparently problematic because although the two expressions seem to denote the same thing, one cannot substitute one for the other, which one ought to be able to do with identical or synonymous expressions. The problem of non-referring expressions is that certain expressions that are meaningful do not truly refer to anything. For example, by \\"any dog is annoying\\" it is not meant that there is a particular individual dog, namely any dog, that has the property of being annoying (similar considerations go for \\"some dog\\", \\"every dog\\", \\"a dog\\", and so on). Likewise, by \\"the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray\\" it is not meant that there is some individual, namely the current Emperor of Kentucky , who has the property of being gray; Kentucky was never a monarchy, so there is currently no Emperor. Thus, what Russell wants to avoid is admitting mysterious non-existent objects into his ontology. Furthermore, the law of the excluded middle requires that one of the following propositions, for example, must be true: either \\"the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray\\" or \\"it is not the case that the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray\\". Normally, propositions of the subject-predicate form are said to be true if and only if the subject is in the extension of the predicate. But, there is currently no Emperor of Kentucky. So, since the subject does not exist, it is not in the extension of either predicate (it is not on the list of gray people or non-gray people). Thus, it appears that this is a case in which the law of excluded middle is violated, which is also an indication that something has gone wrong. Definite descriptions Russell analyses definite descriptions similarly to indefinite descriptions, except that the individual is now uniquely specified. Take as an example of a definite description the sentence \\"the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray\\". Russell analyses this phrase into the following component parts (with 'x' and 'y' representing variables): #there is an x such that x is an emperor of Kentucky. #for every x and every y, if both x and y are emperors of Kentucky, then y is x (i.e. there is at most one emperor of Kentucky). #anything that is an emperor of Kentucky is gray. Thus, a definite description (of the general form 'the F is G') becomes the following existentially quantified phrase in classic symbolic logic (where 'x' and 'y' are variables and 'F' and 'G' are predicates ‚Äì in the example above, F would be \\"is an emperor of Kentucky\\", and G would be \\"is gray\\"): :\\\\exists x ((Fx \\\\land \\\\forall y(Fy \\\\rightarrow x=y)) \\\\land Gx) Informally, this reads as follows: something exists with the property F, there is only one such thing, and this unique thing also has the property G. This analysis, according to Russell, solves the two problems noted above as related to definite descriptions: # \\"The morning star rises in the morning\\" no longer needs to be thought of as having the subject-predicate form. It is instead analysed as \\"there is one unique thing such that it is the morning star and it rises in the morning\\". Thus, strictly speaking, the two expressions \\"the morning star...\\" and \\"the evening star...\\" are not synonymous, so it makes sense that they cannot be substituted (the analysed description of the evening star is \\"there is one unique thing such that it is the evening star and it rises in the evening\\"). This solves Gottlob Frege's problem of informative identities. # Since the phrase \\"the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray\\" is not a referring expression, according to Russell's theory it need not refer to a mysterious non-existent entity. Russell says that if there are no entities X with property F, the proposition \\"X has property G\\" is false for all values of X. Russell says that all propositions in which the Emperor of Kentucky has a primary occurrence are false. The denials of such propositions are true, but in these cases the Emperor of Kentucky has a secondary occurrence (the truth value of the proposition is not a function of the truth of the existence of the Emperor of Kentucky). Indefinite descriptions Take as an example of an indefinite description the sentence \\"some dog is annoying\\". Russell analyses this phrase into the following component parts (with 'x' and 'y' representing variables): *There is an x such that: #x is a dog; and #x is being annoying. Thus, an indefinite description (of the general form 'a D is A') becomes the following existentially quantified phrase in classic symbolic logic (where 'x' and 'y' are variables and 'D' and 'A' are predicates): :\\\\exists x (Dx \\\\land Ax) Informally, this reads as follows: there is something such that it is D and A. This analysis, according to Russell, solves the second problem noted above as related to indefinite descriptions. Since the phrase \\"some dog is annoying\\" is not a referring expression, according to Russell's theory, it need not refer to a mysterious non-existent entity. Furthermore, the law of excluded middle need not be violated (i.e. it remains a law), because \\"some dog is annoying\\" comes out true: there is a thing that is both a dog and annoying. Thus, Russell's theory seems to be a better analysis insofar as it solves several problems. Criticism of Russell's analysis =P. F. Strawson= P. F. Strawson argued that Russell had failed to correctly represent what one means when one says a sentence in the form of \\"the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray.\\" According to Strawson, this sentence is not contradicted by \\"No one is the current Emperor of Kentucky\\", for the former sentence contains not an existential assertion, but attempts to use \\"the current Emperor of Kentucky\\" as a referring (or denoting) phrase. Since there is no current Emperor of Kentucky, the phrase fails to refer to anything, and so the sentence is neither true nor false. Another kind of counter-example that Strawson and philosophers since have raised concerns that of \\"incomplete\\" definite descriptions, that is sentences which have the form of a definite description but which do not uniquely denote an object. Strawson gives the example \\"the table is covered with books\\". Under Russell's theory, for such a sentence to be true there would have to be only one table in all of existence. But by uttering a phrase such as \\"the table is covered with books\\", the speaker is referring to a particular table: for instance, one that is in the vicinity of the speaker. Two broad responses have been constructed to this failure: a semantic and a pragmatic approach. The semantic approach of philosophers like Stephen Neale suggests that the sentence does in fact have the appropriate meaning as to make it true. Such meaning is added to the sentence by the particular context of the speaker‚Äîthat, say, the context of standing next to a table \\"completes\\" the sentence. Ernie Lepore suggests that this approach treats \\"definite descriptions as harboring hidden indexical expressions, so that whatever descriptive meaning alone leaves unfinished its context of use can complete\\". Pragmatist responses deny this intuition and say instead that the sentence itself, following Russell's analysis, is not true but that the act of uttering the false sentence communicated true information to the listener. =Keith Donnellan= According to Keith Donnellan, there are two distinct ways we may use a definite description such as \\"the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray\\", and thus makes his distinction between the referential and the attributive use of a definite description. He argues that both Russell and Strawson make the mistake of attempting to analyse sentences removed from their context. We can mean different and distinct things while using the same sentence in different situations. For example, suppose Smith has been brutally murdered. When the person who discovers Smith's body says, \\"Smith's murderer is insane\\", we may understand this as the attributive use of the definite description \\"Smith's murderer\\", and analyse the sentence according to Russell. This is because the discoverer might equivalently have worded the assertion, \\"Whoever killed Smith is insane.\\" Now consider another speaker: suppose Jones, though innocent, has been arrested for the murder of Smith, and is now on trial. When a reporter sees Jones talking to himself outside the courtroom, and describes what she sees by saying, \\"Smith's murderer is insane\\", we may understand this as the referring use of the definite description, for we may equivalently reword the reporter's assertion thus: \\"That person who I see talking to himself, and who I believe murdered Smith, is insane.\\" In this case, we should not accept Russell's analysis as correctly representing the reporter's assertion. On Russell's analysis, the sentence is to be understood as an existential quantification of the conjunction of three components: *There is an x such that: #x murdered Smith; #there is no y, y not equal x, such that y murdered Smith; and #x is insane. If this analysis of the reporter's assertion were correct, then since Jones is innocent, we should take her to mean what the discoverer of Smith's body meant, that whoever murdered Smith is insane. We should then take her observation of Jones talking to himself to be irrelevant to the truth of her assertion. This clearly misses her point. Thus the same sentence, \\"Smith's murderer is insane\\", can be used to mean quite different things in different contexts. There are, accordingly, contexts in which \\"the current Emperor of Kentucky is not gray\\" is false because no one is the current Emperor of Kentucky, and contexts in which it is a sentence referring to a person whom the speaker takes to be the current Emperor of Kentucky, true or false according to the of the pretender. =Saul Kripke= In Reference and Existence,The book contains Kripke's previously unpublished John Locke Lectures at Oxford in 1973. Saul Kripke argues that while Donnellan is correct to point out two uses of the phrase, it does not follow that the phrase is ambiguous between two meanings. For example, when the reporter finds out that Jones, the person she has been calling Smith's murderer did not murder Smith, she will admit that her use of the name was incorrect.Reimer, M., & Bezuidenhout, A., eds., Descriptions and Beyond (Oxford: Clarendon, 2004), pp. 422‚Äì423. Kripke defends Russell's analysis of definite descriptions, and argues that Donnellan does not adequately distinguish meaning from use, or, speaker's meaning from sentence meaning.Salmon, N.

It is commonly used in the discussion of pneumatic (i.e. pressurized) tires, where the term is used strictly to describe the portion of the tire‚Äôs tread that touches the road surface. The term ‚Äúfootprint‚Äù is used almost synonymously. Solid wheels also exhibit a contact patch which is generally smaller than the pneumatic ‚Äúfootprint‚Äù. Contact patch size The contact patch is the only connection between the road and the vehicle. =Pneumatic rubber tires= The size and shape of the contact patch, as well as the pressure distribution within the contact patch, are important to the ride qualities and handling characteristics of a vehicle. Since the wear characteristics of tires is a highly competitive area between tire manufacturers, a lot of the research done concerning the contact patch is considered highly proprietary and, therefore, very little is published on the subject. Because pneumatic tires are flexible, the contact patch can be different when the vehicle is in motion than when it is static. Because it is so much easier to make observations of the contact patch without the tire in motion, it is more common to conduct studies of the static contact patch. Statically, the size, shape, and pressure distribution are functions of many things,Summary Report: Evaluation of Tire Size and inflation Pressure on Tire Contact Stress and Pavement Response by Emmanuel Fernando, August 2006. the most important of which are the load on the tire and the inflation pressure: * The larger the load on the tire, the larger the contact patch. * The larger the inflation pressure, the smaller the contact patch. These two properties are not linearly proportional to the area of the contact.

Further, the size of the contact patch cannot be simply calculated as load divided by inflation pressure, and the average contact pressure a tire has with the road surface is not equal to the inflation pressure.

Rage's first title Striker sold more than one million copies throughout its two-year life cycle and established Rage as a major creative force in the interactive entertainment industry. The company went through rapid expansion in the 1990s and partnered with multiple third party software publishers for distribution of its titles. Rage Games Limited was floated on the stock exchange in 1996 as Rage Software plc. Rage continued to form commercial partnerships with major publishing houses, including Microsoft, Intel, Dell, Compaq, Nintendo, Sony and Sega, and re-registered as a private company as Rage Software Limited in 1999. In 2000, Rage began to expand into publishing. However, the costs of publishing and a run of games that did not sell as expected (most notably the David Beckham franchise) eventually led to the company closing in January 2003 due to bankruptcy.

It is an ancient town, mentioned in the Mahabharata ruled by King 'Dantavakra'. The town is 69 km from Gwalior, 325 km south of New Delhi and 320 km north of Bhopal. About 15 km from Datia is Sonagiri, a sacred Jain hill. Datia is also about 34 km from Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh and 52 km from Orchha. The nearest airport is at Gwalior. It was formerly the seat of the eponymous princely state in the British Raj. Datia is situated near Gwalior and on the border with Uttar Pradesh (U.P.). The old town is surrounded by a stone wall, encompassing beautiful palaces and gardens. The 17th-century palace of Vir Singh Deo is a notable example of the Hindu architecture of North India. The town serves as a trading center for grains and cotton products. Handloom weaving is an important industry. Datia has several important landmarks and is famous for the seven-story palace built by Raja Vir Singh Deo in 1614. The town is also a thriving pilgrimage spot for religious devotees. There are many temples, including the Sidhapeeth of Peetambhara Devi, Buglamukhi Devi Temple, and Gopeshwar Temple. Peetambra Peeth is a famous Shaktipitha located at the entrance of Datia. This pilgrimage spot is located about 1 km from Datia Bus Station and 3 km from Datia Railway Station on the Delhi-Chennai main line and features Buglamukhi Devi Temple. The Dhumavati Main Temple, established by Golokwasi Swamiji Maharaj, and the Vankhandeshwar temple, a Mahabharat period temple of Shiva, are here. History The state was founded in 1626. Rao Bhagwan Rao, 1st Rao of Datia and Baroni 1626/1656, received Datia and Baroni from his father, Raja Bir Singh Deo of Orchha in 1626, and established his own state. After he died in 1676, the state came under British control with other territories in Bundelkhand under the Treaty of Bassein in 1802. The treaty was formed with the Peshwa. The ancient title of the ruling family was Maharaja Rao Raja, but in 1865 the British Government recognized only the title of Maharaja as hereditary. For the British, the Peshwa maintained a military force consisting of 945 cavalry, 5203 infantry, and 3 million guns. The motto of the royal family was Wir dalap Sharandah (\\"Lord of the Brave Army, Giver of Refuge\\"). In 1896-97, the state suffered from famine, and again to a lesser extent in 1899-1900\\\\. After India's independence in 1947, the Maharaja of Datia acceded the dominion of India, which later merged with the Union of India. Datia, together with the rest of the Bundelkhand agency, became part of the new state of Vindhya Pradesh in 1950. In 1956, the Vindhya Pradesh state was merged with certain other areas to form the state of Madhya Pradesh within the Union of India. Geography Datia is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc ‚Äì Datia It has an average elevation of 302 metres (990 feet). Demographics As of the 2011 India census, Datia had a population of 100,466. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Datia has an average literacy rate of 68%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 75% and female literacy is 60%. In Datia, 15% of the population is under six years of age. Sites of interest Sonagiri Datia is best known for the Pitambara Peeth, a famous shaktipitha located at the entrance of Datia.

The document proclaimed: # Equality and sovereignty of peoples of Russia # Right of peoples of Russia of a free self-determination, including secession and formation of a separate state # Abolition of all national and religious privileges and restrictions # Free development of national minorities and ethnographical groups populating the territory of Russia. The meaning of the Declaration is still disputed in Russian historiography. In 1917 the Bolshevist thinking was still largely idealistic, dominated by vague ideas of \\"universal happiness\\". Also, at that moment Bolsheviks believed that the World revolution was imminent, so they did not care much about loss of territories. However, in the cold-war western literature, it is often argued that in fact Lenin and Stalin agreed to liberate mostly the territories they had no sovereignty over since Russia had lost them to Central Powers in 1915 and 1916. Many historians suggest that the purpose of the document was to limit the public dissent after Russia lost most of its western areas to the advancing German Empire and try to complicate the matters behind the front lines. But in reality, the declaration had the effect of rallying some ethnic non-Russians behind the Bolsheviks. Latvian riflemen were important supporters of Bolsheviks in the early days of Russian Civil War and Latvian historians recognize the promise of sovereignty as an important reason for that. The anti-revolutionary White Russians did not support self-determination and, as a result, few Latvians fought on the side of the White movement. Intended or not, the declaration's provided right to secede was soon exercised by peripheral regions in western Russia, part or which had already been under German army's rather than Moscow's control. But as the revolution spread, also many areas within Russia that have long been integrated declared themselves independent republics. Bolshevist Russia would, however, attempt to establish Soviet power in as many of those as possible. All three Baltic states experienced wars between Soviet governments aiming to establish a Communist state allied with Bolshevist Russia and non-Communist governments aiming for an independent state. The Soviet governments received direct military support from Russia. After the non-Communist side won, Russia recognized them as the legitimate governments of the Baltic states in 1920. The countries would be later invaded and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939. Russian historiography often cited the document as one of the main bases for the liberation of Central European states. Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Belarus and Estonia were either created as puppet states by the Central Powers or liberated by the nations of the abovementioned countries themselves after the collapse of Germany and Austria- Hungary.  List of seceded lands  The following countries declared their independence soon after the Bolsheviks' declaration, establishing themselves as non-Communist states. Although the role this declaration played in their declared independence is doubtful, it eased Bolshevist Russia's recognition of their independence. Except for Finland, all of these areas were outside of Russian sovereignty following the Austro-German successes in the Great War and were officially ceded in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, but the Bolsheviks could not have known this development at the time of the Declaration. * Moldova (December 2, 1917 -- joined Romania in 1918) * (December 6, 1917) * (December 11, 1917) * Ukraine (autonomy November 22, 1917, independence January 22, 1918) * (February 24, 1918) * Transcaucasia (February 24, 1918) * Belarus (March 25, 1918) * Poland (November 11, 1918) * (November 18, 1918) (exact dates need correction) These countries declared their independence, as Communist states, soon after the declaration: * (June 1918) Several other independent republics were proclaimed but were short-lived: * Kuban * Kazan * Kaluga * Ryazan * Bashkurdistan * Orenburg * North Ingria Later developments Bolsheviks never rejected the idea of self-determination, but the Soviet Constitutions (of 1924, 1936 and 1977) limited the right of secession to the constituent republics only. In 1990 Soviet-occupied Lithuania declared its independence again, citing their right to secession as written down in the Soviet Constitution. This would be followed by Soviet-occupied Estonia and Latvia.

He was appointed the first professor of political economy at University College London in 1828. He wrote extensively on economic policy, and was a pioneer in the collection, statistical analysis and publication of economic data. McCulloch was a co-founder, and one of the first editors, of The Scotsman newspaper, and worked on the Edinburgh Review. He edited the 1828 edition of The Wealth of Nations. Career McCulloch attended the University of Edinburgh, but did not graduate. McCulloch collected the early literature of political economy, and wrote on the scope and method of economics and the history of economic thought.J. R. McCulloch, Early English Tracts on Commerce. London: Political Economy Club (1856); Cambridge [Eng.] University Press, 1954. After his death his library was purchased by Lord Overstone and eventually presented to the University of Reading. He was a participant in the Political Economy Club, London, founded by James Mill and a circle of friends in 1821 for an ongoing discussion of the fundamental principles of political economy. McCulloch's works include a textbook, Principles of Political Economy (Edinburgh 1825). He worked on subsequent editions until his death. This book contains a memorable discussion of the origins of profit or interest in the case of a cask of new wine. :\\"Suppose that a cask of new wine, which cost ¬£50, is put into a cellar, and that, at the end of twelve months, it is worth ¬£55, the question is: Should the ¬£5 of additional value, given to the wine, be considered as a compensation for the time the ¬£50 worth of capital has been locked up, or should it be considered as the value of additional labour actually laid out in the wine?\\" This question is still used in discussions of the labour theory of value and related issues. McCulloch used it to illustrate that \\"time cannot of itself produce effect; it merely affords space for really efficient causes to operate, and it is therefore clear it can have nothing to do with value.\\" Reflecting on discussions in the Political Economy Club, Ricardo had privately expressed his famous opinion about the \\"non-existence of any measure of absolute value.\\"Ricardo to Malthus, 15 August 1823. Quoted by Halevy, The Growth of Philosophic Radicalism, Beacon Press, (1955) p. 352. McCulloch died in 1864, and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.  Criticism  McCulloch's theoretical work received harsh criticism from Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk in the latter's History and Critique of Interest Theories (1884). :\\"But probably no member of the English school has been so unhappy in his treatment of the subject or done the theory of interest such a disservice as McCulloch,\\" wrote B√∂hm-Bawerk. :\\"He hovers about the fringes of a number of divergent opinions. He penetrates just far enough into each to become involved in glaring self-contradictions, but he does not expand any one of them sufficiently to form a theory that even approaches consistency.\\" The labour theory of value is an exception, in that McCulloch seems more insistent about it than about any of the contradictory hypotheses he entertained, B√∂hm-Bawerk conceded, but the form of that theory McCulloch endorsed was \\"the most absurd that could possibly occur to a serious thinker.\\" On the subject of the wine cask, B√∂hm-Bawerk wrote that there was an \\"enormous difference between what he was supposed to prove and what he did prove.\\" Although such examples may prove that the mere passage of time is not enough of a change to produce an increase of value, that hardly helps the labour theory of value. The physical changes in the wine are produced by the microbes involved in the fermentation process, and the change in exchange value involves the public's subjective preference for wine over grape juice, and old wine over new.

It connects with the Douglas Bay Horse Tramway at its southern terminus at Derby Castle at the northern end of the promenade in Douglas, and with the Snaefell Mountain Railway at Laxey. The line is undulating and passes through areas of scenic beauty. Many visitors take an excursion on the trams. History The Manx Electric Railway was built by Alexander Bruce, a banker, Frederick Saunderson, a civil engineer and Alfred Jones Lusty, a land owner, who formed the Douglas Bay Estate company to develop land north of Douglas. Construction started in 1893 with the line from a depot at Derby Castle Dep√¥t in Douglas to Groudle Glen and regular public services started on 7 September 1893. Anticipating the second stage of the railway was the extension from Groudle to Laxey, the company was known as the Douglas and Laxey Coast Electric Tramway Company. Construction of this next stage started in February 1894. It was formally opened on 28 July of the same year. The name was temporary, as further expansion was planned, and it became known as the Isle of Man Tramways and Electric Power Company. An extension to Ramsey was approved in May 1897. The line from Laxey to Ramsey opened on 2 August 1898 by the Lieutenant Governor, John Henniker-Major, 5th Baron Henniker. At that date the line ran as far as Ballure, on the outskirts of Ramsey. The final extension to the centre of Ramsey was opened on 24 July 1899. The construction of such a lengthy line in a short period of time had stretched the company's finances, and it was ¬£150,000 in debt. The owning bank foreclosed on the loan and as a consequence Dumbell's Bank failed.Ramsey Courier, Friday, 13 March 1959; Page: 6 The company was liquidated. In 1902 the assets were purchased by Herbert Kidson on behalf of a syndicate of businessmen from Manchester, and the Manx Electric Railway company was born. The sale, which included the Snaefell Mountain Railway, was for ¬£252,000 (). On 2 August 1902 King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra travelled from Douglas to Ramsey in enclosed trailer No. 59. In 1917 the refreshment room at Laxey was destroyed by fire. Fire caused more damage at Laxey in 1930, when the car shed was destroyed, along with four cars, seven trailers, three tower wagons and an open wagon. The car shed was later rebuilt. After the Second World War, the railway struggled financially, and in 1957 it was nationalised at a cost of ¬£50,000 (). A nationalisation livery of green and white was applied to some trams and trailers for a limited time, though this was unpopular and later dropped. A government Board was formed to manage the line and the Snaefell Mountain Railway (and still does so after various changes of title from the original \\"Manx Electric Railway Board\\" to \\"Isle of Man Passenger Transport Board\\", and now Isle of Man Heritage Railways (the word \\"heritage\\" was added in 2009). This is a division of the Department of Infrastructure of the Isle of Man Government, which also operates the island's buses as Bus Vannin). The government invested heavily in the railway starting in 1957, initiating a rail replacement programme between Derby Castle and Laxey at a cost of ¬£25,000 per year for 10 years. The Laxey to Ramsey section was continually under threat; in 1975 the railway lost the mail contract, and services from Laxey to Ramsey were suspended. After public protest, services through to Ramsey restarted in 1977. Winter Saloon No. 20 of 1899, Baldrine railway station The section between Laxey Station and Ramsey was closed again in summer 2008, after a consultancy report commissioned by the Isle of Man Government exposed critical failings in the permanent way, deeming it unsuitable for passenger service in the near future. The island's parliament, Tynwald, agreed to spend nearly ¬£5 million for track replacement in July‚ÄìSeptember, allowing trams to run on a single track, according to a news report. Manx authorities were considering vintage buses as a replacement during the closure, reports previously stated. The resignation of the Tourism and Leisure Minister Adrian Earnshaw was called for by enthusiasts, and Chief Minister Tony Brown ordered an urgent review of the closure decision. He also ordered an independent inquiry into how the track had been allowed to get into such a state. In 2009 the full line operated continuously, and it has continued to do so since the beginning of the 2010 season at Easter, with no rail-related incidents affecting services. Until 1998 the line operated a year-round service, but since then it has run seasonally, usually between March and the beginning of November, though the dates can vary from season to season. Service and routing The line runs on roadside reservation for the first few miles from Douglas and then on segregated track through the countryside for most of the route to Ramsey. However, there are a large number of level crossings, with the main A2 and with various minor roads. The line is narrow gauge and is long. It is largely segregated from road traffic, running on double track on roadside reservation or private right-of-way, and is electrified using overhead lines at 550 volts direct current. Initially the trams used pairs of Hopkinson bow collectors (still used on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, owing to their dependability in strong winds on the mountain) but by the turn of the 20th century they were fitted with trolley poles, the method still employed. Originally the electricity was generated by the railway's own power stations, but now it comes via the island's grid, run by the Manx Electricity Authority. Closure of the line during the winter has allowed substantial investment in infrastructure, including relaying longer stretches of track. right Winter Saloon No. 21, Derby Castle Originally the service was provided by about 24 closed motor tramcars and the same number of open trailers: the earliest of these date from 1893 and almost all are pre-1910. Two of the three cars that opened the line in 1893 are still in use, and they are the oldest electric trams at work on their original line in the world. The design pre-dates any consensus on design, and they have distinctive boxy bodies. Most services are operated by a motor car towing a single trailer. The trailer is often removed in \\"inclement\\" weather. The later cars can haul two trailers. This has never been common practice (in recent years this has included in a few \\"special\\" services as part of the long-running series of events) although it was not uncommon for cars to haul a box-van for freight and, until 1975, a mail van. In September 1975 the line was closed between Laxey and Ramsey, but in 1977 the Ramsey section was reopened. From 1977 a limited winter service operated on weekdays, suspended in 1998 as an economy measure. The line operates a seasonal timetable with services from Douglas terminating at Laxey or Ramsey, with some short workings in connection with the Groudle Glen Railway in peak season, and limited evening operation as far as Laxey in peak season to tie in with evening services on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which since 2009 has provided a weekly \\"Sunset Dinner\\" service including a meal at the summit. The possibility of a limited evening service to Ramsey has been considered in recent times, and trams are sometimes chartered during summer for enthusiasts' excursions. Derby Castle Terminus, 1972 Railway stations Ramsey Plaza railway station There are several intermediate railway stations, with Groudle Glen, Laxey, Dhoon Glen, Cornaa and Ballaglass Glen shown in timetables. The official stopping points usually have a basic waiting shelter (more recent additions have been modern bus shelters), and there are \\"unofficial\\" stopping points that sometimes have \\"request stop\\" notices but not nameboards or other passenger facilities. Several in the more rural areas have the name of the nearby farm or farmer; these are most prevalent in the northern section with names such as Rome's Crossing, Watson's Crossing and Dhoon Farm, but none of these has carried its name. Some stopping points are known by their nearest pole number, numbered 1 to 1,904 from Derby Castle to Ramsey. Trams stop within reason at any point where it is safe to do so, except where the line runs parallel to a main road. The majority of the line as far as Baldrine railway station runs in this way, as does the approach to Ramsey. These sections were originally toll roads, built at the same time as the line. Tramcars and trailers \\"Paddlebox\\" Car No. 16 of 1898 at Derby Castle Car Shed The line is in many ways unique, not least because it still operates entirely with its original rolling stock, except for winter saloon 22, which was completely rebuilt after a fire in 1990 which made the bodywork unusable. A considerable amount of stock was lost in a disastrous fire at Laxey in 1930, but other than this all the original stock remains. In recent times the storage of excess stock has become something of a political \\"hot potato\\": several vehicles were stored off-site; they all returned to on-site storage in November 2009, requiring considerable attention before returning to traffic in many cases. The line belongs to the Isle of Man Government, formerly as part of the Department of Community, Culture & Leisure, which does not see the requirement to retain unused stock that has no potential use or long-term storage place on the railway. The line has Lisbon tram purchased in 1999, but this has never seen use due to clearance difficulties (it was used as a passenger waiting shelter for a spell). It is no longer on the railway, but remains on the island. Winter Saloon No. 21 of 1899, Laxey railway station The following trams were in passenger service in the 2010 season, with the mainstay of the services being winter saloons or tunnel cars. Original tramcars 1 and 2 are both operational but are not usually in day-to-day use, tunnel cars 5 and 6 see use in peak summer season and illuminated car 9 (also a member of this class) is used in conjunction with the evening services on the Groudle Glen Railway in July and August. Winter saloons 19-22 operate the core timetable. There are serviceable open toastracks, numbers 26, 32 and 33 (the last two being the most powerful on the line). Many other cars remain in the railway's possession but out of service and in some cases off-site. Trailers used include lightweight trailers 37 and 49, bulkheads 40-48 which usually accompany the winter saloons, lightweight trailer 51, converted disabled saloon 56, closed saloons 57 and 58 and 61‚Äì62. The Royal Saloon, No. 59, makes rare public appearances. As part of the annual transport festival car 32 occasionally operates a special evening service hauling two trailers, an unusual occurrence despite the later cars being built with the capability to operate in this way. Car 7 was relegated to permanent way duties for a number of years but was restored for return to traffic in 2011. Locomotive 23 is privately owned; car 34 (previously No. 7 Maria on the Snaefell Mountain Railway and regauged) is undergoing maintenance, and other cars receive remedial attention as and when time and funding allows. Throughout its history, the MER has had a total of 34 motor cars, of which 27 survive today in some shape or form. The history of the unpowered half of the MER's passenger vehicle fleet is complicated, as there have been withdrawals, scrappings, replacements, conversions and several renumberings. The motors are numbered mainly in order of construction; however, this does not apply to the trailers: these have always followed on from the highest numbered motor. This changed several times between 1893 and 1906, and some trailers have carried several numbers as they were renumbered almost yearly to allow for new arrivals. Some were even converted into motors. Wagons The history of the freight carrying wagons and vans of the Manx Electric Railway is complicated and varied, from an initial start with only four wagons, to the heyday in the 1920s‚Äì1930s, to the current modern-day situation where only a handful are in serviceable condition. Permanent way Since its opening, there has been a varying level of commitment to keeping the line in serviceable condition. A great variety of stock has been either bought in or converted from previous examples, some gaining a more unlikely use than others. Visitors There have been many visiting examples of traction and stock to the Manx Electric Railway throughout its history, some used in the original construction of the line, others for special events and centenaries. Incidents Winter Saloon No. 21 of 1899, Ramsey Plaza Owing to the number of open and ungated level crossings there are minor collisions, and these are reported in the local press. These have become more commonplace but are usually minor; warning signage to alert motorists that trams are operating has been erected at the start of each season in recent times, but incidents still occur. There are many occupation crossings, some with restricted visibility for motorists. The most recent incident took place on Monday, 27 July 2009, when a vehicle carrying a mechanical excavator came into contact with the overhead wires supplying power to both the line and the Snaefell Mountain Railway at a busy road crossing in Laxey; there were no injuries. Police and the line's electrical engineering crews attended the scene, the report also said. It did not indicate what damage had occurred. Service resumed the next day after temporary repairs to the overhead lines, which were permanently repaired over the subsequent couple of weeks. An investigation into the incident was scheduled to take place later.Manx Independent page3 dated 31 July 2009 Isle of Man Newspapers About 70 metres of copper overhead wire were stolen between late January and 14 February 2012 between Laxey and Ramsey. Police recovered the stolen material. On 7 July 2015, trailer 58 suffered a serious derailment on a relatively new crossover just north of Laxey Station, toppling onto its side. Services were suspended between Laxey and Ramsey. A complex operation was undertaken to lift the trailer back upright. It required a road closure, removal of overhead line equipment and a large crane. The re-railed trailer was then moved by tractor to Laxey Station and has since returned to service after overhaul.

They first appeared in Shadow Cabinet #0 (January 1994), and were created by Dwayne McDuffie, Robert L. Washington III and John Paul Leon. Almost all of the original run, issues #4-11 and #13-17, were written by Matt Wayne. Publication history In the Milestone Comics universe the Shadow Cabinet is a secret organization of superhuman beings acting to protect the world by neutralizing potential threats while they are still relatively harmless - \\"to save humanity from itself, no matter what that requires\\". Various Cabinet members may be sent on \\"deep-cover\\" missions lasting months, or even years (during which time some choose to defect), their total membership at any time is known only to their leader. The base of operations for the Shadow Cabinet is the Shadowspire, a subterranean complex within the Himalayas and typically accessible only via the Shadowslide, their teleporter (so named because, if the subject's origin is not in complete darkness at the time of teleport, the machine overloads and cannot be used for up to an hour). An all new Shadow Cabinet emerged in the post-Infinite Crisis DC Universe in pages of Justice League of America. After attempting to abduct Doctor Light they find themselves in conflict with the Justice League. It turns out that Icon and Superman were secretly working together and the two teams end up joining forces to save the universe as Dharma brings together the DC and Milestone universes into one unified continuity.McDuffie, Dwayne, Ed Benes, and Rags Morales. \\"When Worlds Collide.\\" Justice League of America. DC Comics: New York, 2009. Team biography =Red Dog= Red Dog, a powerful Irish sorcerer, is the leader of the Shadow Cabinet from the late nineteenth century until the mid twentieth. Several of his people include 'Bent Nature', 'Ether', 'The Magnate' and 'Munition'. Red Dog recruits Dharma as his replacement, but his activities do not end there. Dharma is slain by one of his own people and Red Dog steps in to bring him back to life. Red Dog disagrees with Dharma's efforts to take over the world and re-forms his own Cabinet to stop him. =Dharma= Dharma, otherwise known as Harry Chawney, has the power to perceive the past and future of any object he touches. He has perceived countless apocalypses, and is ruthless in acting to prevent them, whatever the cost. In theory, he knows the ultimate consequences of whatever action he sends his operatives to perform; however, the impossibility of considering every factor has led to his fear that he may be causing the very disasters he is trying to prevent - in the words of one agent: \\"What about the man who died? His future could have been important too. Did you check?\\", to which he was forced to respond: \\"I can't think about that right now\\".Shadow Cabinet #11 (April 1995) The Cabinet makes an appearance in Blood Syndicate #20 when Dharma fires Oro, who has been a Syndicate associate, police officer, and a Shadow Cabinet operative. He is allowed to keep his costume and receives one month severance pay deposited directly into his bank account. Dharma even gives Oro advice to \\"take the left\\" as Oro teleports out.Blood Syndicate #20, (Nov 94) The teleportation technology is maintained by powerful telekinetic and engineer Thomas Hague, better known as \\"Mechanic\\". Another notable employee is Payback, a spy for the independent superhero Icon. Icon also has evidence that Dharma had been involved in the 'Big Bang', a riot which, due to altered tear gas, ended with dozens of fatalities and superpowers granted to the survivors. He would not treat further departures from the Cabinet as gracefully as Oro's. When Cabinet operatives Iota, Donner, and Blitzen leave to form the unofficial team Heroes, Dharma sends a Cabinet attack squad. This group is led by Iron Butterfly.\\"Heroes\\" #2-3 =DC Universe= An all new Shadow Cabinet has appeared in the pages of Justice League of America.Justice League of America (Vol. 2) #27 (November 2008) Following the death of Darkseid (as chronicled in Final Crisis), the space-time continuum was torn asunder, threatening the existence of both the Dakotaverse and the mainstream DC universe. The being known as Dharma was able to use energies that he harnessed from Rift (upon that being's defeat in Worlds Collide) to merge the two universes, creating an entirely new continuity. Only Dharma, Icon and Superman are aware that Dakota and its inhabitants have actually existed in a parallel universe. In the revised continuity, the Milestone characters have apparently always existed in the DC Universe.Justice League of America (Vol. 2) #30 (February 2009)Justice League of America (Vol. 2) #34 (June 2009) =Milestone Forever= In the 2010 limited series Milestone Forever, which details the end of the original Milestone universe before its merger into the DCU, the truth behind Dharma's actions is shown. It is revealed that he was responsible for the Big Bang, hoping to create powerful beings capable of preventing a fast- approaching apocalypse whose cause he could not determine. When his last two prospects, Hardware and Static, fail to meet his expectations, he turns to the only course he believes is left open to him; awakening and harnessing the powers of the god-like being Rift. However, the very act of absorbing the being's powers causes widespread destruction to the universe, destroying the Milestone Earth. Thus the cause of the apocalypse he foresaw was his own attempts to stop it, although not all is lost, as his new powers allow him the opportunity to bring about his universe's rebirth. The effects of Darkseid's death during the Final Crisis of a neighboring universe gives him the chance to merge the remnants of the Milestone Universe into the DC Universe, retroactively combining their histories, and giving the Milestone characters the chance to live anew. Membership =Modern team= *Bad Betty - a cyborg who was sent on a deep-cover mission to infiltrate organized crime. *Blitzen (Valerie Kameya) - is superhumanly fast as the result of a substance she developed herself. A Japanese biochemist who is in a lesbian marriage with Donner, later joins Heroes. Harry Chawney (Dharma), artist John Paul Leon *Donner (Gerri Brauer) - is superhumanly strong and resistant to injury. The German granddaughter of a Nazi geneticist, in a lesbian marriage with Blitzen, later joins Heroes. *Epiphany - appeared only once, upon being recalled from a deep-cover mission. *Iota (Isadora Wellington-Smythe) - is an international jewel thief with the ability to shrink herself and other objects. *Iron Butterfly (Kahina Eskandari) - is a Palestinian with ferrokinetic control of all metallic substances. *Payback (Kevin Franklin) - a Bang Baby able to transform into large yellow-green skinned monster with superhuman strength and durability. *Plus (Bina & Apurna Chawney) - are the teenage sisters of Harry Chawney (Dharma). Apurna is an energy being and lacks physical form; Bina uses this energy to fly and manipulate objects. *Ramjet - is a retired mercenary possessing superhuman strength and the power of flight. He first appeared upon being recalled from a deep-cover mission. Ramjet was later part of the Shadow Cabinet operatives ordered to destroy the Heroes. *Sideshow (Ramon Rand) - is a photojournalist who is able to transform any part of his body into the equivalent body part of any other animal species; this enables him to recover instantly from intoxication. *Starlight (Stella Maxwell) - is a college math major turned human pulsar with various electromagnetic abilities, later joins Heroes. *Twilight - both a living portal into another dimension, and the man forever trapped within that dimension, Twilight resembles a silhouette of a chubby man wearing a top hat.

His personal dimension is also home to a collection of peculiar supernatural creatures which he has painstakingly acquired over the years; he can, at will, release them in the hopes that they will carry out his wishes (however, he has no direct control over them). At one point, other operatives entered Twilight in the hopes that Dharma would not be able to perceive them, but whether this worked is not known. *Windshear - is capable of mentally creating whirlwinds of varying size and strength. She first appeared upon being recalled from a deep-cover mission.

Star Chamber also included several new recruits: Holocaust, Harm, Rocket and Xombi, although all of them left the group during the Shadow War. * Ash - able to artificially induce rapid aging in inorganic objects, turning them to dust. Ash can induce this effect by touch or at a distance if the target is within line of sight. She also can telekinetically control any dust in her vicinity. Thus, Ash can create blinding dust storms or project dust as focused, high speed streams that rapidly erode their targets. * Funyl - able to teleport himself or others via funnel-shaped teleportation portals. * Headmaster - psychic abilities including mind control, characterized by a number of devices of various shapes which orbit his head. * Rainsaw - a living cloud of several million microscopic razor-sharp fragments of metal capable of flying through the air at hurricane speeds. Rainsaw is capable of tearing through armor plating in less than a second. He can also turn his cloud-like form into any continuous shape imaginable. Rainsaw can revert to a roughly humanoid form, in which he is capable of limited shapeshifting such as turning his hands into buzzsaws. * Slag - superhumanly strong with fire manipulation abilities. * Transit - able to teleport people and objects she touches over great distances.

They blend the song structures of hardcore with heavy metal, and the band cites Sick of it All, Aphex Twin, The Sisters Of Mercy, and The Obsessed as influences, among others. They were signed to Trustkill Records until it dissolved in 2010. They are now with Trustkill president Josh Grabelle's new label Bullet Tooth. The band and its members advocated straight edge, vegetarianism and veganism, and they were all animal rights belligerents. As of 2015, vocalist Rob Fusco is no longer. However, they deny being preachy in any way, saying \\"I'm not going around trying to change people because people are going to change when they want to... if I said something that you found truth in, or that you found made sense, cool - I'm glad I was a catalyst to help you come to your own conclusions.\\" History Originally, the band featured former Indecision guitarists Justin Brannan and Rachel Rosen, as well as on-again off-again Indecision vocalist, Tom Sheehan. On their debut full-length for Trustkill Records, Nothing In Vain (2001), Brannan played guitar, Rosen played bass, and Sheehan did vocals. Nothing In Vain was recorded in a 9' x 15' one room studio in an abandoned building near Sailors Snug Harbor, Staten Island. The building was once an old age home for sick and dying wayward sailors. There were odd noises that ended up on the master tapes that the band never recalled hearing during the recording. The album was engineered/produced by long-time Indecision producer Ron Thal who would later go on to play guitar for Guns N' Roses. Original Indecision drummer Pat Flynn played drums on Nothing In Vain but left the group immediately following the completion of the record. Flynn walked out of the studio once he finished his drums tracks; the cymbals still sizzling. The band then recruited Sean McCann. He would stay with the group for several years and would play on 2003's Our Lady of Annihilation. McCann then left the band in the middle of the night before the band was set to fly to Arizona for a gig. When the band woke up and McCann was nowhere to be found; only a Dear John letter was left behind underneath the wiper blade of the band's van parked outside. The band still boarded the plane and flew down to Arizona without a drummer. The band hooked up with the drummer from Where Eagles Dare, a hardcore punk outfit from Arizona, and used their drummer for the show, teaching him the songs the night before the gig. In 2003, after Sheehan departed the band to return to school, the band teamed up with former One King Down vocalist Rob Fusco, added Atlanta's Matt Miller on bass and moved Rosen to second guitar for their second album Our Lady of Annihilation. Surprise hits \\"The Great Red Shift\\" and \\"Your Picture Hung Itself\\" launched the band's profile. The album also features a guest appearance from Sick Of It All's Lou Koller. MPB contributed a cover of \\"Sweet Child Of Mine\\" to Bring You to Your Knees: a Tribute to Guns N' Roses, a cover of \\"Rise Above\\" to Black on Black: A Tribute to Black Flag, and a cover of \\"Alone\\" to Our Impact Will Be Felt: a Tribute to Sick of It All with Paul Klein (A Lifeless Alliance, Gotham Road, The Banner) filling in on drums. MPB was the first American Hardcore band to tour South Africa. They've also been to 50+ countries, including most of Europe, as well as Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, and all over the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico. Rachel Rosen and Justin Brannan appeared in minor roles in Threat, an independent film produced in the NYHC scene. MPB has had 13 drummers over the history of the band. Sean McCann (2001-2003) and Colin Kercz (2004-present) are the longest serving. =Recent activity= The band has denied rumors of a break-up, claiming they've just been taking time off to relax and write a new album, after an over two-year non-stop global touring schedule. The band has been quoted as saying they were interested in \\"bowing out of the mass appeal madness\\" that has struck the hardcore scene and wants nothing to do with the \\"glossy culture\\" anymore. The band has been finished with their fourth album, Do Not Resuscitate, for some time. Do Not Resuscitate was released February 1, 2011 on Bullet Tooth, formerly Trustkill Records.

A tree-lined pedestrian street, it stretches for connecting the in its center with the Christopher Columbus Monument at Port Vell. La Rambla forms the boundary between the quarters of the to the east and the to the west. La Rambla can be crowded, especially during the height of the tourist season. Its popularity with tourists has affected the character of the street, which has shifted in composition to pavement cafes and souvenir kiosks. It has also suffered from the attention of pickpockets. The Spanish poet Federico Garc√≠a Lorca once said that La Rambla was \\"the only street in the world which I wish would never end.\\"  Orientation  Map of La Rambla La Rambla can be considered a series of shorter streets, each differently named, hence the plural form (the original Catalan form; in Spanish it is ). The street is successively called: * - the site of the fountain * - the site of the former Jesuit University, whose only remainder is the Church of Bethlehem * (or ) - the site of an open-air flower market * - the site of a former Capuchin monastery, now dominated by the Liceu opera-house * - an arts center named after the convent of St. Monica. To the north of La Rambla lies , a large square in central Barcelona that is generally considered to be both Barcelona's city center and the place where the old city and the 19th century-built converge. To the east of La Rambla is the or Gothic Quarter, the heart of the old city of Barcelona. The retains a labyrinthine street plan, with small squares and streets, many of which connect onto the Rambla. One of the larger of these squares is the , a lively 19th century square with tall palm trees and street lamps designed by Antoni Gaud√≠, which opens down a short entrance passage off the . Further into the can be found the Cathedral of Santa Eul√†lia and the that houses the buildings of the Generalitat of Catalonia and Barcelona's City Council. To the west of La Rambla is the rather different quarter. Outside the city's earliest walls, this area was originally the site of various religious and medical institutions. Later factories grew up along with housing for the workers, whilst the proximity to the port led to the area becoming known for its nightlife and clubs, as well as prostitution and crime. Today the area still retains a degree of 'edge', but it also home to several important buildings, including Gaud√≠'s , which is only a few steps down the from the . At the southern end of the Rambla is the Christopher Columbus Monument and the Port Vell, the old port of Barcelona, now largely given over to pleasure craft. Near to the port end of the Rambla are the Royal Dockyards (), which house a maritime museum specifically devoted to naval history in the Mediterranean. Extensions at either end of the Rambla also carry the name Rambla, but are not normally considered part of La Rambla itself. To the north, the extends into the district. To the south, construction of the in the early 1990s resulted in a continuation of La Rambla on a wooden walkway into the harbor. History Barcelona around 1700, showing La Rambla running down the city center and flanked by the old city wall on its right. The course of La Rambla was originally a sewage-filled stream, usually dry but an important drain for the heavy rainwater flowing from the Collserola hills during spring and autumn. (, from the Arabic 'sand', is Catalan for \\"wadi\\". The name of the city of Ramla in Israel is derived from the same origin).) It separated the walled city on its north-east bank from the settlements of El Raval (\\"the suburb\\") on its south-west. In the year 1377, construction started on an extension of the city walls to include La Rambla and El Raval. In 1440, the stream was diverted to run outside the new walls, and La Rambla gradually started turning into a street. Over the next few centuries, La Rambla became an established center of Barcelona's urban life, serving as a long wide thoroughfare used for festivals, markets, and sports. Several large religious establishments were also built along the street during this period. These include the Jesuit Bethlehem monastery and college (1553), of which just the later church remains; the Carmelite St. Joseph's monastery, on the site of the current Boqueria market; and a Capuchin monastery at the lower end of the street. La Rambla in 1905 In 1703, the first of the trees lining La Rambla were planted. They were 280 birch trees and later on those were replaced by elm trees. In 1832 some acacias were planted and the currently standing plane trees started to be the common tree from 1859. Various conflicts over recent centuries took their toll on La Rambla's religious buildings, most notably the St. James's Night riots in 1835 when revolutionaries burned the monasteries and churches and killed a number of friars; and the Spanish Civil War in 1936‚Äì39, when Barcelona came under the control of anarchists who again targeted religious buildings and personnel, as well as being damaged by artillery and air attacks on the area from pro-Franco forces. Until 2010, the was the site of an open- air market for caged birds and other small pets. However animal protection laws made it difficult for the market to continue. After years of fighting the legislation, the market was forced to close. On 17 August 2017, many people were struck by a van deliberately driven down the sidewalk on La Rambla in a terrorist attack, causing 15 deaths and at least 100 injuries. Sights Flower shop on La Rambla The tree-lined central promenade of La Rambla is crowded during the day and until late in the night. Its origins as a watercourse are reflected in the paving design, which appears to ripple like water. Along the promenade's length are kiosks that sell newspapers and souvenirs, other kiosks selling flowers, street traders, performers, and pavement cafes and bars. Several notable sights are also located within the promenade, including a mosaic by Joan Mir√≥ and the , a fountain and popular meeting point. Along the Rambla are historic buildings such as the Palace of the Virreina and the Theater (), in which operas and ballets are staged. The market opens off the Rambla and is one of the city's foremost tourist landmarks, housing a very diverse selection of goods. One of the side streets, which is only a few meters long, leads to the Royal Square (), a plaza with palm trees and porticoed buildings containing many pubs and restaurants, and where stamp and coin collectors gather on the weekends.  Culture  Pavement mosaic by Joan Mir√≥ on La Rambla The Rambla is the location for several of Barcelona's cultural establishments, including: * the , or simply , is Barcelona's opera house, opened in 1847. * the , is the oldest theater in Barcelona, founded in 1568 and subsequently rebuilt several times since. * the is a public museum of contemporary art located on the Raval side of , with regular exhibitions of international artists. * the , a Baroque palace, hosts museum exhibitions and cultural events. In the can be found a pavement mosaic created in 1971 by the famed artist Joan Mir√≥.  Transport  Pedestrian traffic and entrance to metro station The most obvious transport mode on La Rambla is its heavy flow of pedestrians, who largely use the wide central pedestrianized area. This is flanked by two narrow service roads, which in turn are flanked by narrow pedestrian walkways in front of the buildings. Despite its length, no vehicular traffic is permitted to cross the central pedestrian walkway. Line L3 of the Barcelona Metro runs beneath the length of La Rambla, with stations at: * , immediately adjacent to , is a major interchange station served by several metro and suburban railway lines. * , in front of the opera house , serves the central section of La Rambla. * is by the port next to . Three Barcelona Bus lines operate along the service roads flanking La Rambla during the day (numbers 14, 59 and 91), whilst three different night time services also operate along La Rambla (numbers N9, N12 and N15).

It has earned the nicknames belvedere (panoramic viewpoint) and ombelico (\\"navel\\") of Sicily. At above sea level, Enna is the highest Italian provincial capital. History Enna is situated near the center of the island; whence the Roman writer Cicero called it Mediterranea maxime, reporting that it was within a day's journey of the nearest point on all the three coasts. The peculiar situation of Enna is described by several ancient authors, and is one of the most remarkable in Sicily. The ancient city was placed on the level summit of a gigantic hill, surrounded on all sides with precipitous cliffs almost wholly inaccessible. The few paths were easily defended, and the city was abundantly supplied with water which gushes from the face of the rocks on all sides. With a plain or table land of about 5 km in circumference on the summit, it formed one of the strongest natural fortresses in the world. =Prehistoric= Archaeological excavations have revealed artifacts dating from the 14th century BC, proving human presence in the area since Neolithic times. A settlement from before the 11th century BC, assigned by some to the Sicanians, has been identified at the top of the hill; later it was a center of the Sicels. In historical times, Enna became renowned in Sicily and Italy for the cult of the goddess Demeter (the Roman Ceres). Her grove was known as the umbilicus Siciliae (\\"The navel of Sicily\\"). Ceres' temple in Henna was a famed site of worship.Barbette S. Spaeth, The Roman Goddess Ceres, pp. 73-74, 78-79, 129 (U. of Texas Press 1996) . The origin of the toponym Henna remains obscure. =Classical period= Ceres, an important site for devotion to the goddess. Dionysius I of Syracuse repeatedly attempted to take over Enna. At first he encouraged Aeimnestus, a citizen of Enna, to seize the sovereign power. Afterward Dionysius I turned against him and assisted the Ennaeans to get rid of their despot. But it was not till a later period that, after repeated expeditions against the neighbouring Sicilian cities, Dionysius took control of the city by betrayal. Agathocles later controlled Enna. When the Agrigentines under Xenodicus began to proclaim the restoration of the other cities of Sicily to freedom, the Ennaeans were the first to join their standard, and opened their gates to Xenodicus, 309 BC. Accounts of the First Punic War repeatedly refer to Enna; it was taken first by the Carthaginians under Hamilcar, and subsequently recaptured by the Romans, but in both instances by treachery and not by force. In the Second Punic War, while Marcellus was engaged in the siege of Syracuse (214 BC), Enna became the scene of a fearful massacre. The defection of several Sicilian towns from Rome had alarmed Pinarius the governor of Enna. In order to forestall any treachery, he used the Roman garrison to kill the citizens, whom he had gathered in the theater, and killed them all. The soldiers were allowed to plunder the city. Eighty years later Enna was the center of the First Servile War in Sicily (134 BC-132 BC), which erupted under the lead of Eunus, a former slave. His forces took over Enna. It was the last place that held out against the proconsul Rupilius, and was at length betrayed into his hands. According to Strabo, the city suffered much damage after the Romans regained control. He believed this was the start of its decline. Cicero referred to it repeatedly in a way to suggest that it was still a flourishing municipal town: it had a fertile territory, well-adapted for the growth of cereal grains, and was diligently cultivated till it was rendered almost desolate by the exactions of Verres. From this time little is known about Enna: Strabo speaks of it as still inhabited, though by a small population, in his time: and the name appears in Pliny among the municipal towns of Sicily, as well as in Ptolemy and the Itineraries. When the Roman Empire was divided in 395AD, Sicily became part of the Western Roman Empire. The noted senatorial family of the Nicomachi had estates in Sicily. Around 408 the politician and grammarian Nicomachus Flavianus worked on an edition of the first 10 books of Livy during a stay on his estate in Enna. This was recorded in the subscriptions of the manuscripts of Livy. =Post-Roman= After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Enna flourished throughout the Middle Ages as an important Byzantine stronghold. In 859, in the course of the Islamic conquest of Sicily, after several attempts and a long siege, the town was taken by Muslim troops, who entered one by one through a sewer to breach the town's defenses. Afterwards, 8,000 residents of the city were massacred by Muslim forces.Paul Fregosi (1998) Jihad in the West: Muslim Conquests from the 7th to the 21st Centuries, pp. 132-133. The Arabic name for the city, Qa·π£r YƒÅnih (, \\"Fort of John\\"), was a combination of qa·π£r (a corruption of the Latin castrum, \\"fortress\\"), and a corruption of Henna. The city retained its name in the local dialect of Sicilian as Castru Janni (Italianized as Castrogiovanni), until Benito Mussolini ordered renaming in 1927. The Normans captured Enna in 1087. Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, established a summer residence here, which is now called the Torre di Federico (\\"Frederick Tower\\"). Troops of North Italian soldiers,http://www.ilcampanileenna.it/i-normanni.html from regions such as Lombardy, Piedmont, Liguria and Emilia-Romagna, came to settle in the city and neighbouring towns such as Nicosia and Piazza Armerina. Gallo-Italic dialects are still spoken in these areas, dating from this early occupation. Enna had a prominent role in the Sicilian Vespers that led to the Aragonese conquest of Sicily, and thenceforth enjoyed a short communal autonomy. King Frederick III of Sicily favored it and embellished the city; it suffered a period of decay under the Spanish domination. It was restored as provincial capital in the 1920s. In 2002 it became a university city. The citizens of the city have a high incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease seen more frequently among people of North European extraction; perhaps this is related to the Norman immigration. MS is also prevalent in Sardinia, which has the second highest incidence in the Mediterranean basin. Classical mythology The Lake of Pergusa, the mythological location of the Rape of Persephone. The neighborhood of Enna is celebrated in myth as the place whence Persephone (Latin: Proserpine) was carried off by Pluto, god of the underworld.Ovid, Met. v. 385-408; Claudian, de Rapt. Proserp. ii.; Diod. v. 3. The spot assigned by local tradition as the scene of this event was a small lake surrounded by lofty and precipitous hills, about 8 km from Enna. The meadows abound in flowers, and a nearby cavern or grotto was believed to be where the king suddenly emerged. This lake is called \\"Pergus\\" by Ovid Met. v. 386. and Claudian.l. c. ii. 112. Neither Cicero nor Diodorus refers to any lake in relation to this myth. The former says that around Enna were lacus lucique plurimi, et laetissimi flores omni tempore anni.Cicero, In Verrem iv. 48. Diodorus describes the spot whence Persephone was carried off as a meadow so full of fragrant flowers that hounds could not follow their prey. He described the meadow as enclosed on all sides by steep cliffs, and having groves and marshes in the neighborhood, but does not refer to a lake.v. 3. Both he and Cicero allude to a cavern, as if describing a definite site. In the 21st century, a small lake is found in a basin-shaped hollow surrounded by great hills, and a cavern near is noted as that described by Cicero and Diodorus. But much of the flowers and trees had disappeared by the 19th century, when travelers described the area as bare and desolate.Richard Hoare (1819) Classical Tour. London: J. Mawman, vol. ii, p. 252; Gustav Parthey (1834) Wanderungen durch Sicilien und die Levante. Berlin: Nicolaische Buchhandlung, Tl. 1, p. 135; Marquis of Ormonde (1850) Autumn in Sicily. Dublin: Hodges and Smith, p. 106, who has given a view of the lake. Both Ceres and Persephone were worshipped in Enna. Cicero said that the temple of Ceres was of such great antiquity and sanctity that Sicilians went there filled with religious awe. Verres looted from it a bronze image of the deity, the most ancient as well as the most venerated in Sicily.Cicero In Verrem iv. 4. 8. No remains of this temple are now visible. Standing on the brink of the brink of the precipice, it fell with a great rockfall from the edge of the cliff.Fazello, Tommaso x. 2. p. 444; M. of Ormonde, p. 92. Other remnants of classical antiquity were likely destroyed by the Saracens, who erected the castle and several other of the most prominent buildings of the modern city.Hoare, l. c. p. 249. Ancient name Henna Coins minted for Enna under the Roman dominion still exist, carrying the legend \\"MUN. (Municipium) HENNA\\". The aspirated form of the name confirms the authority of Cicero, whose manuscripts give that form.Zumpt, ad Verr. p. 392. The most ancient Greek coin of the city also gives the name \\"ŒóŒïŒùŒùŒëŒôŒüŒù\\".Eckhel, vol. i. p. 206. Scholars have concluded that this form, Henna, of the ancient name is the more correct for its time, though Enna is the more usual. University, culture and education Enna is now an important center for archaeological and educational studies. The Kore University of Enna was officially founded in 2002. Main sights Interior of the Cathedral of Enna. The most important monuments of Enna are: *The Castello di Lombard√¨a (Lombardy Castle), perhaps the most important example of military architecture in Sicily. It was built by Sicanians, rebuilt by Frederick II of Sicily, and restructured under Frederick II of Aragon. The castle is named for the garrison of Lombard troops that defended it in Norman times. It has an irregular layout which once comprised 20 towers: of the six remaining, the Torre Pisana is the best preserved. It has Guelph merlons. The castle was divided into three different spaces separated by walls. The first courtyard is the site of a renowned outdoor lyric theater; the second one houses a large green park, while the third courtyard includes the vestiges of royal apartments, a bishop's chapel, medieval prisons, and the Pisan Tower. The Lombardy Castle. *The Duomo (Cathedral), a notable example of religious architecture in Sicily, was built in the 14th century by queen Eleonora, Frederick III's wife. It was renovated and remodeled after the fire of 1446. The great Baroque facade, in yellow tufa-stone, is surmounted by a massive campanile with finely shaped decorative elements. The portal on the right side is from the 16th century, while the other is from the original 14th-century edifice. The interior has a nave with two aisles, separated by massive Corinthian columns, and three apses. The stucco decoration is from the 16th and 17th centuries. Art works include a 15th-century crucifix panel painting, a canvas by Guglielmo Borremans, the presbytery paintings by Filippo Paladini (1613), and a Baroque side portal. The cathedral's treasure is housed in the Alessi Museum, and includes precious ornaments, the gold crown with diamonds known as the \\"Crown of the Virgin,\\" Byzantine icons, thousands of ancient coins, and other collections. *Palazzo Varisano was adapted to house the Regional Archaeological Museum of Enna. It has material dating from the Copper Age to the 6th century AD, recovered from many archaeological areas in the Province of Enna. *Torre di Federico, is an octagonal ancient tower that was allegedly a summer residence of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen. The two floors possess beautiful vaults. The aspect of the building is austere. It was part of a bigger complex, named Old castle and destroyed by Arabs. Remnants include some pieces of the old, imposing walls on the top of the green hill where the Tower rises. Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, in the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II *The Campanile of the destroyed church of San Giovanni, features pointed arches with finely shaped archivolts, and a three-light mullioned window with Catalan-style decorations. *The Municipal Library is located in the San Francesco building, a former church. It has a notable 15th-century campanile and, in the interior, a fine painted Cross from the same century. *The church of San Tommaso is of note for its 15th-century belfry, with three orders. It has windows framed by an agile full-centered archivolt. The church contains a marble icon (1515) attributed to Giuliano Mancino and precious frescoes by Borremans. *The Janniscuru Gate is the only one preserved of the seven gates that once gave entrance through the town wall. It is a fine 17th- century Roman arch, positioned in an area of rock grottoes under the ancient, traditional quarter of Fundrisi. These grottoes were used as a necropolis by ancient peoples thousands of years ago. =Pergusa lake and archaeologic site= The Holy Week procession of the Confraternities in Enna. Lake Pergusa (Latin: Pergus lacus or Hennaeus lacus) lies between a group of mountains in the chain of Erei, about 5 km from Enna. It is part of an important migratory flyway for many species of birds. The Pergusa nature reserve also has numerous species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates. Around the lake is the most important racing track of Southern Italy, the Autodromo di Pergusa. It has hosted international competitions and events, such as Formula One, Formula 3000, and a Ferrari Festival featuring Michael Schumacher. Near Pergusa lake is the archaeological site known as Cozzo Matrice. These are the remains of an ancient prehistoric fortified village, with walls dating about 8000 BC. Other remains, dating to more than 2000 years ago, are a sacred citadel, a rich necropolis, and the remains of an ancient temple dedicated to Demeter. Pergusa is strongly linked to the myth of the Greek Persephone, Demeter's daughter, who was kidnapped from here by Pluto and taken to Hades, the underworld, for part of the year. From that captivity, seasons arose. The important forest and green area named Selva Pergusina (meaning Pergusa's Wood) surrounds a part of the Lake Pergusa Valley.

(2014) The Improbable Beijing Guidebook, Sinomaps, Beijing, , p.69 History The Marquis of Extended Grace lived near Dongzhimen. Transport The 2nd Ring Road currently links with two roads which eventually become the Airport Expressway and China National Highway 101. A new flyover, and a new express road connects directly with the Airport Expressway. The Beijing subway network has a node stop at Dongzhimen, where Lines 2 and 13 connect. Line 13 has its eastern terminus at Dongzhimen. The Capital Airport Express also calls at Dongzhimen. Dongzhimen also has an extensive public bus hub just outside the Dongzhimen station. Buses numbered greater than 800 start from a long-distance bus station area, which serves a wide range of locations inside and outside of Beijing. This includes special buses to the Great Wall and long-distance buses to the mountains and caves north of Beijing and smaller suburban towns such as Pinggu. Ghost Street West of Dongzhimen is Guijie (Á∞ãË°ó), or \\"Food vessel street\\" (Dongzhimen Inner Street). The character for Gui (Á∞ã) refers to a round-mouthed bamboo basket for food.

It was listed on the TSX (under the symbol FAL.LV) and NYSE (FAL), and had revenue of US$6.9 billion in 2005. In August 2006, it was absorbed by Swiss-based mining company Xstrata, which had formerly been a major shareholder. Falconbridge, named after the town Falconbridge, which in turn was named for a prominent \\"son\\", one Sir William Glenholme Falconbridge, High Court Judge whose father John Kennedy Falconbridge, had migrated to Ontario from Lisburn Ireland. Falconbridge was an important player in the economic and commercial development of the northern region of Ontario Canada, particularly the communities in and around Sudbury. History In 1928, experienced prospector and businessman Thayer Lindsley purchased mining claims containing rich deposits of nickel-copper ore in the area northeast of Sudbury.Flash presentation at . See \\"About us\\", \\"History and Milestones\\" Retrieved 28 August 2006 These claims had been established as early as 1901, when Thomas Edison made the original discovery of the Falconbridge ore body, but remained undeveloped until Lindsley's purchase. Soon thereafter, planning and construction of a company town began, to house and service workers for the future mines. The community, complete with utilities and a medical centre, was named Falconbridge after the geographic township in which it was located. Likewise, the company became known as Falconbridge Nickel Mines Limited. Just one year later in 1929, the new company acquired the Kristiansand Nikkelraffineringsverk A/SMining and Regulation: Voisey's Bay (BP-422E) refinery in Kristiansand, Norway. This expanded its operations, but more importantly the company also gained the rights to the Hybinette nickel refining process. The operations at the Falconbridge site expanded in the early 1930s. By 1930 ore from an underground mine was being extracted at 250 tonnes per day, and a nearby smelter was in operation to process the material. In 1932, a mill and sintering facility began operation. Through the 1950s and 1960s, significant expansion of the Sudbury Basin operations took place, including some twelve new mines. All recovered nickel, copper, and smaller amounts of other materials including platinides. Meanwhile, the Nikkelverk operation began recovering cobalt alongside previous extractions in 1952, using a new refining process. In 1962, Falconbridge acquired Ventures Limited, including its numerous international operations and geological exploration infrastructure, allowing further expansion and growth outside of Canada. In 1971 the Falconbridge Dominicana (Falcondo) mine and process plant commenced operation in Bonao, Dominican Republic. The site employed a novel reduction and smelting technique superior to the kiln process. To aid in community development, the Falcondo Foundation was established in 1989 and has been a pioneer in Natural Resource Corporate Social Responsibility. In 1977, Falconbridge patented the chlorine leach nickel refining process that had been developed in-house. The late 1970s saw the company play a role, alongside Inco, in the environmental reclamation efforts undertaken in the Sudbury region. As part of this, a new, more efficient smelter was opened, as well as a facility for the production of sulfuric acid. This commercially saleable chemical had been a source of significant ecological damage when it was produced in the atmosphere by the reaction of sulfur dioxide emissions. The new acid plant allowed this effect to be greatly reduced by catalyzing the reaction before emission, while producing additional revenue from the sale of the acid. By 1984, the commercial reserves at the original Falconbridge Mine had been exhausted. Production continued at several other sites in the Sudbury area. The company expanded within northern Ontario by acquiring the Kidd Mine in Timmins, Ontario. Expansion continued in the 1990s, with a new mine in Sudbury, and one at Raglan in northern Quebec, though Falconbridge lost the bidding war with Inco for the deposit at Voisey's Bay.Mining and Regulation: Voisey's Bay (BP-422E) The new century saw more acquisitions, including the Montcalm mine in Timmins, the Kabanga project in Tanzania, and the Lomas Bayas mine in Chile. In June 2005 Falconbridge merged with Noranda, previously the 58.4% owner, continuing under the name Falconbridge Limited. Noranda brought significant variety to the business, including operations in aluminum mining and recycling of electronic hardware. Operations as of 2006 At the time of the Xstrata takeover, Falconbridge had major operations in and around the Sudbury Basin, including the Craig, Fraser, and Thayer Lindsley underground copper/nickel mines, as well as a mill (Strathcona), nickel smelter, sulfuric acid plant, and a technology centre. In 2005, Falconbridge had started the Deposit Definition phase of the Nickel Rim South mine near the Sudbury Airport. Metal refining was no longer carried out in Sudbury by Falconbridge, but rather at its Falconbridge Nikkelverk operation in Kristiansand. Another Canadian operation was the Kidd Mine site in Timmins, Ontario which includes an underground zinc/copper mine, mill, copper smelter and copper refinery, zinc plant, indium plant, cadmium plant, and sulfuric acid plants. Falconbridge also operated the Montcalm underground nickel mine west of Timmins. Other sites were located in Quebec, Ontario (Rouyn-Noranda: Horne copper smelter, Montreal: CCR copper refinery, Salaberry-de-Valleyfield: CEZ zinc refinery, Nunavik: Raglan underground nickel/copper mine and mill) and Bathurst, New Brunswick (Brunswick underground zinc/lead mine, lead smelter and lead refinery, and silver refinery). Copper and precious metal recycling facilities were at Brampton, Ontario; East Providence, Rhode Island; La Vergne, Tennessee; Roseville, California; San Jose, California; and Penang, Malaysia. Falconbridge Ltd. also operated an aluminium smelter in New Madrid, Missouri and an alumina refinery in Gramercy, Louisiana. The aluminum produced from these mills was prepared in one of four rolling mills located in Huntingdon, Tennessee (2 mills); Salisbury, North Carolina (1 mill); and Newport, Arkansas (1 mill). Central American and Caribbean projects included the St. Ann bauxite mine in Discovery Bay, Jamaica and the Falcondo nickel surface mine and processing plant in Bonao, Dominican Republic. South American properties were mainly copper deposits such as the Antamina copper/zinc open- pit mine in northern Peru, the Collahuasi copper/molybdenum open-pit mine (including mill, liquid‚Äìliquid extraction plant, and electrowinning plant) in northern Chile, the Lomas Bayas open-pit copper mine (including liquid‚Äìliquid extraction plant and electrowinning plant), and the Altonorte copper smelter also in northern Chile. Falconbridge also owned a Boeing 737-200 (registration C-FFAL). The aircraft is based in Toronto at Pearson International Airport. The aircraft was repainted with Xstrata livery following the takeover, and still operates. Merger efforts and acquisition On 11 October 2005, Inco announced a proposal to acquire Falconbridge for $12 billion. This came at a time of especially high prices for base metals, including nickel. Part of the motivation for the merger was to avoid a takeover of either company by cash- flushed foreign competitors. Additionally, significant synergies would have been realized in the Sudbury operations, with both companies performing the same kind of extraction and smelting work on the same kind of ore. The two companies were set upon by hostile takeover bids from rival firms. Swiss Xstrata, already 19.9% owner of Falconbridge, bid for a complete acquisition, while Teck Cominco of Vancouver set its sights on Inco. On 13 May 2006, Inco announced that it increased its offer to acquire Falconbridge by $5.00 CAD per share, bringing the bid to $61.04 CAD per share (based on 23 June 2006 Inco/Phelps Dodge share price). On 26 June 2006, Phelps Dodge made a bid for the proposed combined Inco/Falconbridge company, valued at around US$40 billion. This would have formed the Phelps Dodge Inco Corp., valued at US$56 billion, creating the fifth largest mining company, largest nickel producer, and the second largest copper producer in the world with corporate and copper division headquarters located in Phoenix, Arizona and nickel division headquarters in Toronto, Ontario. The deadline for the Inco offer was 13 July 2006. On 18 May 2006, Xstrata had announced a proposal to acquire Falconbridge for $52.50 CAD per share. This was a cash offer, unlike the Inco offer of a combination of cash and shares. On 12 July 2006, Xstrata announced that it increased its offer to acquire Falconbridge to $59.00 CAD per share (an approximate total value of $22.5 billion CAD). This counter-offer was 9.6% higher than Inco's bid. The deadline for Xstrata's bid to be complete was 21 July 2006. Xstrata acquired and absorbed Falconbridge in late August 2006, leaving Inco open to bids by Phelps Dodge and the Brazilian company CVRD.http://www.cvrd.com.br/cvrd_us/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?infoid=1567&sid;=373 Falconbridge became Xstrata Nickel, which was still to be based in Toronto. 1 May 2013 Glencore completed purchase of Xstrata. Social impact in Sudbury Falconbridge lent its name to a company town northeast of Sudbury which grew to be a community in its own right. The town of Falconbridge was incorporated by the provincial government in 1957.Heritage Museums It was organized along with several other communities into the Town of Nickel Centre and Regional Municipality of Sudbury in 1973; the regional municipality was in turn amalgamated into today's city of Greater Sudbury in 2001. Some Falconbridge workers also lived in the nearby community of Happy Valley, which was abandoned in the 1960s due to pollution from the Falconbridge smelter. \\"Falco\\", as it was often called by Sudbury residents, remained for decades the second-largest employer in the Sudbury area, exceeded only by rival mining giant Inco. The economic fortune of the city was tied to those of the mining companies, as a strike at either company had a major effect on the livelihood of thousands of workers. The effect diminished as economic diversification progressed in the 1980s and 1990s. Citizens, particularly workers and their families, came to develop an attachment to what were seen as local companies with significant size and influence in the mining industry. In particular, a certain degree of rivalry between workers at the two mining giants, who were members of rival labour unions, developed. In the 1950s and early 1960s, factional wars between the competing unions sometimes led to riots in the streets of Sudbury. A proposal to merge Inco and Falconbridge in 2006 was headed with the slogan \\"Two proud histories, one great future\\",http://www.city.greatersudbury.on.ca/content/div_councilagendas/documents/PresidentsBreakfastslides- Oct-05.pdf#search=%22inco%20%22two%20proud%20histories%22%22 in reference to the strong identities which workers and the community had attached to the companies. A major street in Sudbury is named Falconbridge Road, after the company and community. In 2007, Xstrata donated Falconbridge's historic Edison Building, its onetime head office, to the city of Greater Sudbury to serve as the new home of the city archives.

She was considered one of the great beauties of pre-Revolutionary society, but her extravagance and exclusivity earned her many enemies. Biography Yolande Martine Gabrielle de Polastron was born in Paris in the reign of King Louis XV. Her parents were Jean Fran√ßois Gabriel, Count of Polastron, seigneur de Noueilles, Venerque and Gr√©piac, and Jeanne Charlotte H√©rault de Vaucresson. As was customary with aristocrats, most of whom bore more than one Christian name, she was generally known by the last of her names (Gabrielle). Chapter 15: \\"The New Society\\". She was born into a family of ancient aristocratic lineage, but by the time of Gabrielle's birth the family, despite its exalted ancestry, was encumbered by many debts, and its lifestyle was far from luxurious. While Gabrielle was still an infant, her parents moved the family to Ch√¢teau of Noueilles, in the province of Languedoc in southern France. When Gabrielle was 3, her mother died and her welfare was entrusted to an aunt, who arranged for her to receive a convent education. At the age of 16, Gabrielle was betrothed to Jules Fran√ßois Armand, comte de Polignac, marquis de Mancini (1746‚Äì1817), whom she married on 7 July 1767, a few months short of her 18th birthday.Gastel Family Database Polignac's family had a \\"well-bred\\" ancestry similar to Gabrielle's family, and was in equally uncomfortable financial straits. At the time of his marriage, Polignac was serving in the R√©giment de Royal Dragons (\\"1er r√©giment de dragons\\"), on an annual salary of 4,000 livres. Within a few years of the marriage, Jules and Gabrielle had two children: a daughter Agla√© and a son. Two more sons followed several years later, including Jules, prince de Polignac, who became the prime minister of France in 1829, under Charles X. =Appearance= Most surviving portraits show her to be pretty. One historian said that Gabrielle, in her portraits by Louise √âlisabeth Vig√©e Le Brun, generally looks \\"like some harvested and luscious fruit.\\" She had dark brunette hair, very pale white skin, and, perhaps most unusually, lilac or violet-coloured eyes. Compiling the contemporary accounts of her, one modern historian has summarised her physical appearance thus: =Versailles= Marie Antoinette was instantly \\"dazzled\\" by the duchess of Polignac When her sister- in-law Diane de Polignac invited her to the Court at Versailles, Gabrielle came with her husband and was presented at a formal reception in the Hall of Mirrors in 1775, at which time she was formally presented to the Queen of France, Marie Antoinette, who was instantly \\"dazzled\\" by her, and invited her to move permanently to Versailles. The cost of maintaining oneself at the court of Versailles was ruinous, and Gabrielle replied that her husband did not have the money to finance a permanent move to the palace. Determined to keep her new favourite by her side, the Queen agreed to settle the family's many outstanding debts and to find an appointment for Gabrielle's husband. Once she was installed in the palace, near the Queen's apartments, Gabrielle also won the friendship of the King's youngest brother, the comte d'Artois, and the approval of King Louis XVI himself, who was grateful for her calming influence on his wife and encouraged their friendship. describes the King's support of Gabrielle. Describes Madame de Polignac's impact on Marie Antoinette. Gabrielle was, however, resented by other members of the royal entourage, particularly the Queen's confessor and her chief political adviser, the Austrian ambassador. In a letter to the Queen's mother, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, the ambassador wrote, \\"It is almost unexampled that in so short a time, the royal favour should have brought such overwhelming advantages to a family.\\" Charismatic and beautiful, Gabrielle became the undisputed leader of the Queen's exclusive circle and ensured that few entered without her approval. Gabrielle was considered by many of her friends to be elegant, sophisticated, charming, and entertaining. The entire Polignac family benefited enormously from the Queen's considerable generosity, but their increasing wealth and lavish lifestyle outraged many aristocratic families, who resented their dominance at Court. Ultimately, the Queen's favouritism towards the Polignac family was one of the many causes which fueled Marie Antoinette's unpopularity with some of her husband's subjects (especially Parisians) and members of the politically-liberal nobility. In 1780, Gabrielle's husband was given the title duc de Polignac, thus making Gabrielle a duchesse, a further source of irritation to the courtiers. By the late 1780s, thousands of pornographic pamphlets alleged that Gabrielle was the Queen's lesbian lover, including accusations that the pair had engaged in tribadism. Although there was no evidence to back up these accusations, they did immeasurable damage to the prestige of the monarchy, especially given the deep-rooted suspicion of homosexuality held by the bourgeoisie and urban working-classes at the time. Several historians have suggested that reports of Gabrielle's extravagance have been greatly exaggerated, and they point out that, during her 14-year residency at Versailles she spent as much as Louis XV's mistress, Madame de Pompadour, had spent in one. Others have contended that to some extent she deserved her negative reputation because, despite the inaccuracies of the claims that she was sexually disreputable, other criticisms of her were valid: she was cold, self-centred, self-indulgent, and masked a love of gossip and intrigue behind a sweet-toned voice and flawless manners. This argument was particularly championed by the author and biographer Stefan Zweig, who wrote: > \\"Not even Madame de Maintenon, not even the Pompadour, cost as much as this > favourite, this angel, with downcast eyes, this modest and gentle Polignac. > Those who were not themselves swept into the whirlpool, stood at the marge > contemplating it with astonishment ... [as] the Queen's hand was invisibly > guided by the violet-eyed, the lovely, the gentle Polignac.\\" Another critic is Elisabeth de Feydeau. =Governess of the Children of France= In 1782, the Governess to the Children of France, Victoire de Rohan, princesse de Gu√©m√©n√© and wife of Henri Louis de Rohan, had to resign her post due to a scandal caused by her husband's bankruptcy. The Queen replaced the princess with Gabrielle. This appointment generated outrage at court, where it was felt Gabrielle's social status was insufficient for a post of that magnitude. √âlisabeth Vig√©e-Lebrun As a result of her new position, Gabrielle was given a 13-room apartment for herself in the palace. Technically, this was within the acceptable limits of etiquette, but the size of the apartment was unprecedented, particularly in a place as overpopulated as Versailles. Royal governesses had previously been quartered in four or five room apartments. Gabrielle was even given her own cottage in Marie Antoinette's favorite pastoral refuge, the Hameau de la Reine, built in the 1780s on the grounds of the Petit Trianon in the park of Versailles. Gabrielle's marriage was cordial, if not successful; it was typical of aristocratic arranged marriages. For many years, she was apparently in love with the captain of the Royal Guard, Joseph Hyacinthe Fran√ßois de Paule de Rigaud, Comte de Vaudreuil, although many of her friends considered Vaudreuil too domineering and too uncouth for the kind of society in which Gabrielle moved. It was rumored at Versailles that Gabrielle's youngest child was actually fathered by Vaudreuil. However, the exact nature of Gabrielle's relationship with Vaudreuil has been debated by some historians,See John Hardman, Marie-Antoinette: The Making of a French Queen (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2019), pp. 83-88, for a profile of Vaudreuil's career in which he argues Vaudreuil was lovers with Madame de Polignac, and Vincent Cronin, Louis and Antoinette (London: Collins, 1973), pp. 220-221, 316, for the argument that their liaison was essentially platonic who doubted the liaison was sexual. This theory has recently been resurrected by Catholic novelist and commentator Elena Maria Vidal. Despite the claims that they were lovers, Gabrielle showed no hesitation in distancing herself from Vaudreuil whenever she felt her own social position was threatened by the Queen's dislike of the manipulative courtier. There are hardly any letters surviving from the couple, who either in reality may not have been sufficiently close to write to each other when separated, or may just have been very careful in masking their communications for political reasons. Their letters may have been subsequently destroyed either by themselves or others for precaution's sake.Cronin, Louis and Antoinette, p. 394 =Children= * Agla√© Louise Fran√ßoise Gabrielle de Polignac (7 May 1768, Paris; 30 March 1803 in Edinburgh). ** Married the duc de Gramont et Guiche.

In the American edition of Madame Campan's memoirs, her account of the Queen's reaction can be found on p. 195-6 The Queen was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the ambition of her favourites, especially when they championed a politician whom the Queen despised. Chapter XII. Marie Antionette confided to another lady-in-waiting, Henriette Campan, that she was \\"suffering acute dissatisfaction\\" over the Polignacs. Wrote Campan: \\"Her Majesty observed to me that when a sovereign raises up favourites in her court she raises up despots against herself\\". Eventually, Gabrielle felt Marie Antoinette's displeasure and decided to visit friends in England, particularly Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who was the leader of London high society and one of Gabrielle's closest friends.sometimes published as The Duchess. During her time in England, she earned the nickname \\"Little Po,\\" due to her delicate constitution. =Revolution= Pamphlet against the duchesse de Polignac printed in 1789, after her escape to Switzerland The months leading up to the July 1789 outbreak of the French Revolution saw the Queen and the duchesse de Polignac become close again. Politically, Gabrielle and her friends supported the ultra-monarchist movement in Versailles, and Gabrielle became increasingly important in royalist intrigues as the summer progressed, usually in partnership with her friend, the comte d'Artois, the King's youngest brother. The marquis de Bombelles, a diplomat and politician, remembered Gabrielle's ceaseless work to promote hardline responses against the emergent revolution. Together with the baron de Breteuil, Bombelles' godfather and former diplomat, and the comte d'Artois, Gabrielle persuaded Marie Antoinette to work against the King's popular minister of finances, Jacques Necker. However, without the necessary military support to crush the insurrection, Necker's dismissal fuelled the serious violence in Paris, culminating in the attack on the Bastille fortress. After the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, all the members of the Polignac family went into exile. On Louis XVI's express orders, the comte d'Artois left, as did Breteuil; Gabrielle went with her family to Switzerland, where she kept in contact with the Queen through letters. After Gabrielle had left, the care of the royal children was entrusted to the Marquise de Tourzel. =Exile= After her departure from France, she and her family lived an ambulating life, travelling from one place to another. She kept in contact with Marie Antoinette through correspondence, by which her place of residence can be traced. The Polignac family travelled through Switzerland, Turin, Rome and Venice (where she attended the wedding of her son in March 1790), and from Italy to Vienna in Austria in 1791. She was reportedly present in the Austrian Netherlands during the Flight to Varennes, and in July 1791, she is noted as one of the extravagantly dressed women who attended the √©migr√©e court of the count of Provence in Koblenz.Langlade, √âmile. Rose Bertin: Creator of Fashion at the Court of Marie Antoinette (London: John Long, 1913). The emigree court in Koblenz was however dissolved after the Battle of Valmy in 1792, and she returned to Austria, where she died. Gabrielle developed a terminal illness while living in Switzerland, although she had arguably been in poor health for several years. She died in Austria in December 1793, shortly after hearing of Marie Antoinette's execution. Gabrielle's family simply announced that she had died as a result of heartbreak and suffering. Most historians have concluded that she died of cancer, and contradictory royalist reports of her death suggested consumption as an alternative cause. No specific mention of her disease was made in the various allegorical pamphlets which showed the Angel of Death descending to take the soul of the still-beautiful duchesse de Polignac. Her beauty and early death became metaphors for the demise of the old regime, at least in early pamphlets and in subsequent family correspondence, the duchess's beauty was a much-emphasised point. Progeny Jules Auguste Armand Marie de Polignac, prince de Polignac. Gabrielle was the mother of Jules, prince de Polignac, who became Prime Minister for Charles X (the former comte d'Artois) in 1829. She was also the mother of Agla√© de Polignac, duchesse de Guiche, who died in 1803, in an accidental fire. Two of her grandsons were Camille Armand Jules Marie, Prince de Polignac and Prince Edmond de Polignac. Her great-great-grandson, Count Pierre de Polignac, was the father of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco. Her descendants can also be found in France and in Russia, where her granddaughter, daughter of \\"Guichette\\", married a nobleman, Aleksandr Lvovich Davydov. Legacy Gabrielle de Polastron's mark in history can be seen in history books, novels, movies, and other media. ;In popular culture For example: *She is one of the major characters in The Rose of Versailles (1979), a sh≈çujo manga/anime created by Riyoko Ikeda *She is played by Claudia Cardinale in two-part film La R√©volution fran√ßaise (1989) *She is portrayed by Rose Byrne in the film Marie Antoinette (2006) *She is portrayed by Virginie Ledoyen in the film Farewell, My Queen (2012) ;In history Her critics among historians have argued that the Duchesse de Polignac typified the aristocratic hangers-on at the court of Versailles before the French Revolution and that she embodied the exclusivity, the obliviousness, and the selfish extravagance of the ruling class. However, more sympathetic historians, such as Pierre de Nolhac and the Marquis de S√©gur, agree that most of the problems originated with her entourage and that she was certainly no worse than many of the aristocrats or favourites who had preceded her at Versailles. Assessments of her character aside, it is generally agreed that she was one of the key figures in the ultra-monarchist movement throughout the early summer of 1789, acting under the influence of her friend, the Comte d'Artois.

CHC's major international operating units are based in Australia, Brazil, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom. The company is one of several global providers of helicopter transportation services to the offshore oil and gas industry (others including Bristow Helicopters and NHV). CHC has capabilities in precision flying techniques and technical support. CHC has long-term working relationships with most of the major oil and gas companies. CHC operates the marine search and rescue service for the Irish Coast Guard at Shannon, Waterford, Sligo and Dublin airports. CHC provides helicopter services in Australia for the Fire and Emergency Services Authority of Western Australia, Victoria Police and the Ambulance Service of New South Wales. History =Origins= The origins of CHC Helicopter can be traced back to the start of commercial helicopter operations in British Columbia. Following the end of the Second World War, three former Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) instructors, Carl Agar, Barney Bent and engineer Alf Stringer, aspired to continue flying aircraft and chose to form their own flight training club, the South Okanagan Flying Club, in Penticton using a handful of de Havilland Tiger Moths and a Bell 47. Shortly thereafter, Carl and Barney partnered with ex-RCAF engineer Alf Stringer to join the group. However, as there was not much demand for private pilot training at the time, the three men chose to relocate the business to Kelowna and rebranded it as Okanagan Air Services Ltd. Early on, Okanagan Air Services operated only fixed-wing aircraft, such as a pair of Cessna 140s, to perform charter and training flights. Agar became interested in the potential of the newly- emerging helicopter and of its potential application to the commercial market; the three men travelled to Yakima to attend a demonstration of the Bell 47, the first commercially-certified helicopter. Upon their return, they immediately set about securing backers from which to finance their expansion into rotorcraft. In July 1947, the company was able to raise sufficient finance to purchase its own Bell 47-B3 helicopter, CF-FZX, as well as to funding training on both its maintenance and piloting. Upon its delivery on 9 August 1947, it was the first commercially licensed helicopter in British Columbia. The company's initial use of its helicopter largely revolved around crop dusting; on 1 September 1947, CF-FZX was damaged after striking powerlines, but was repaired after several months. While it became clear that small-scale crop dusting was not economic with the type, insect spraying was more lucrative however. Agar's flying skills proved valuable during mountain flying in support of government topographic survey efforts; this pioneering use of a helicopter led to Agar being awarded the Trans-Canada Trophy in 1950 and gain valuable publicity for the company. Further mountain survey flights led to Okanagan receiving contracts from companies like Aluminum Company of Canada Ltd to support remote construction projects and to transport personnel or equipment to and from the wilderness. Even so, the company remained unprofitable for its first few years. =Expansion= A Sikorsky S-61 in Okanagan Helicopters livery During the early 1950s, the company officially renamed itself Okanagan Helicopters Ltd. By the end of 1952, it had become the largest commercial helicopter operator in North America and one of the largest in the world. Throughout much of the 1950s, Okanagan participated in the construction and maintenance of the Mid-Canada Line of radar stations, using a mixed fleet of Sikorsky S-55 and Bell 47s. By the end of 1958, the firm was operating a fleet of 51 rotorcraft at various locations all across Canada. In the 1960s, Okanagan continued to grow into new locations and new markets, retaining a heavy focus on remote construction projects. During 1963, it received its first overseas contract from East Pakistan, which it met via a single Bell 47J. The 1970s was a period of transformation for Okanagan. Only Bent remained on staff by this point as both Agar and Stringer had resigned during the 1960s over disputes on how the company ought to be run. Okanagan embarked on a spree of acquisitions, purchasing companies such as Universal Helicopters, Haida Helicopters, Lac Saint-Jean Aviation, Dominion-Pegasus Helicopters, Sept-Iles Helicopter Services, Associated Helicopters and Bow Helicopter. By 1975, 20 percent of the company‚Äôs revenue came from international sources; a dedicated international division was established to manage this business sector. Furthermore, as a result of the turboshaft engine having displaced the piston engine on newer and more capable helicopters, Okanagan began to introduce turbine-powered rotorcraft into its fleet, including the Bell 204, Bell 212, Sikorsky S-58T, Sikorsky S-62, and Sikorsky S-76. By 1981, Okanagan was the largest helicopter company in Canada, operating a fleet of 125 helicopters, along with 900 employees and annual revenues of $83 million Cdn. The company attracted the attention of various investors, leading to a takeover by Canadian oil company Resource Service Group; soon thereafter, Alan Bristow, the founder of Britain's Bristow Helicopters, acquired a 49 percent ownership stake in the company. =CHC era= In 1987, Newfoundland businessman Craig Dobbin headed a group of investors organized under the name Canadian Holding Company, commonly using the initialism CHC. CHC purchased Okanagan Helicopters, along with Viking Helicopters, and Toronto Helicopters; all three merged their assets with Dobbin's own company, Sealand Helicopters, to form a new company, initially branded Canadian Helicopters, while the parent company was renamed CHC Helicopter Corporation. The new entity placed a great priority upon merger and acquisition opportunities, in addition to forming strategic partnerships, that would allow it to enter new or lightly-served regions, such as South America. During the 1990s and 2000s, CHC continued to acquire various other operators, including British International Helicopters in 1994; Helicopter Services Group of Norway in 1999 (including Bond Helicopters), Helikopter Service AS, Lloyd Helicopters of Australia and Court Helicopters of South Africa. In 2004, CHC purchased Schreiner Aviation Group, which specialised in provided offshore helicopter services in the Dutch sector of the North Sea and to the Nigerian offshore industry. In 2000, CHC agreed with Fonds de Solidarit√© FTQ (FSTQ) and the management of its two Canadian divisions, Canadian Helicopters Eastern and Canadian Helicopters Western, to sell an interest in CHC's Canadian assets via a management buyout to form Canadian Helicopters; consequently, senior management and FSTQ acquired 10% and 45% equity interests in Canadian Helicopters, respectively, while CHC retained a 45% equity interest. During 2004, CHC decided to reorganise its operations into two principal divisions; Helicopter Services became responsible for the firm's global operations, while Heli-One functions as the world‚Äôs largest independent provider of helicopter maintenance, repair, and overhaul services. As part of the restructuring, the company relocated its corporate headquarters from St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador to Richmond, British Columbia. In late February 2008, all of CHC's shares were purchased by First Reserve, a US private equity company, for CAD$3.7 billion ($3.5 billion), following the latter's uninvited offer. Around this same time period, the word \\"Corporation\\" was dropped from the company's name, having been formally rebranded as CHC Helicopter. In January 2014, the company announced its intention to raise up to $529 million through an initial public offering, the proceeds of which it mainly intended to use to paid down outstanding debts. On 16 January 2014, CHC announced an initial public offering of 31,000,000 shares at a price of $10 per share. On 15 January 2016, CHC offered 31,000,000 shares at US$5.17. On 5 May 2016, the company filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. CHC's bankruptcy was attributed to recent drops in the price of oil having negatively impacted revenue, making it unable to service the company's high burden of debt; other helicopter operators were also reported to be struggling under the prevailing economic conditions of the period as well. Reflecting the company's drop in performance, CHC's share value dropped from US$176.10 on 17 November 2014 to US$0.45 by 17 June 2016. During July 2016, a Texas court allowed CHC to shed 65 helicopters from its financial obligations, the majority of its Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma fleet. On 1 March 2017, a reorganised CHC emerged, relaunching its brand and web presence. In December 2019, a 18 month-long dispute between CHC and British union staff over pay was settled. Divisions CHC manages its global operations through the following divisions: * EEA Helicopter Operations B.V. (\\"EEA\\"), a Dutch company majority owned by EHO Holdings S.a.r.l. and minority owned by CHC Helicopter S.a.r.l., provides helicopter services in the North Sea. EEA operates under the CHC brand name and uses CHC logo under licence. It provides services from 17 bases in the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands. * Brazilian Helicopter Services (BHS) (Brazil) * CHC Helicopters Global Operations/Corporate Office (Richmond, British Columbia) * CHC Helicopters (Australia) * CHC Helicopters (Africa) * CHC Composites (Gander, Newfoundland)  CHC EMS and SAR services  =Ireland= CHC S-61 operated for the Irish Coast Guard CHC Helicopter serves as the sole provider of Search and Rescue helicopter services to the Irish Coast Guard, where it had operated a fleet of six Sikorsky S-61N helicopters based in Dublin, Shannon, Waterford, and Sligo. This fleet has now been replaced by 5 Sikorsky S-92 Helibus. The S-61N exited service in December 2013 with a flight from Dublin Airport to Weston Aerodrome, West Dublin. The flight was operated by EI-SAR, the oldest S-61N in commercial operation at the time. =United Kingdom= CHC, as part of the Soteria SAR consortium was selected as the \\"Preferred Bidder\\" for a 25-year contract to provide a civilian Search and Rescue service throughout the United Kingdom. However, days before the contract was due to be signed in February 2011, the British Government halted the process after CHC disclosed that it had unauthorised access to commercially sensitive information. The Soteria SAR was cancelled and the contract was awarded to back to Bristow Helicopters, who had operated the coastguard helicopters from Stornoway Airport, Sumburgh Airport, RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus) and RNAS Portland (HMS Osprey) during the time of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force operating their Westland Sea Kings, prior to the Soteria SAR being setup. =Australia= CHC is the largest provider of emergency medical helicopter services in Australia.

Tindall played outside centre for Bath and Gloucester, and won 75 caps for England between 2000 and 2011. He was a member of the England squad which won the 2003 World Cup. He made his debut for England on 5 February 2000, against Ireland in the 2000 Six Nations Championship. As well as winning the 2003 World Cup, he was a member of the England team which won the 2003 Six Nations Championship. He was injured at the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In total, Tindall played in eleven Six Nations Championship competitions from 2000 to 2011. Tindall is married to Zara Phillips, the daughter of Anne, Princess Royal, and the eldest granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Early life Tindall was born 18 October 1978 at Wharfedale Hospital in Otley, West Yorkshire, the son of Linda Shepherd, a social worker, and Philip Tindall, a banker for Barclays. Tindall's ancestors include, on his mother's side, bootmakers, stonemasons and weavers; on his father's side, his great-grandfather, Arthur Sutcliffe Tindall, was a blacksmith, the grandson of William Tindall, a landowner farming 105 acres at Fairburn, North Yorkshire. Tindall was educated at the private school Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield, while his father Phil captained Otley Rugby Union Football Club. Career =Bath= Tindall joined Bath straight from school, as an 18-year-old in 1997. At that point the centre pairing at Bath and England were Jeremy Guscott and Phil de Glanville, but after the 1999 Rugby World Cup, Tindall played regularly at both club and country level, making his England debut against Ireland at Twickenham in 2000 alongside Mike Catt. Despite criticism over the years, in particular from Will Carling and ex-Bath fly-half Stuart Barnes, he cemented the outside centre position as his own with a partnership with inside centre Will Greenwood, playing in the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Tindall wore the number 12 jersey and played at outside centre, with Greenwood in the number 13; Tindall usually lined up outside Greenwood, as the latter preferred to wear the number 13 jersey for superstitious reasons. He was dropped for the semi-final in favour of Mike Catt, whose kicking was required in the rainy weather. Tindall was reinstated in the final, which England won. Tindall missed the 2005 Six Nations with a foot injury. He was unable to regain his fitness for the British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. Described by England's former head coach, Andy Robinson, as the 'heartbeat' of the side, Tindall was gradually finding his way back to form following a lengthy absence from the game during 2005. Tindall's contract was up for renewal, but Bath had a strict salary cap policy. After falling out with Bath owner Andrew Brownsword over the offer of an early testimonial game and further concerns over his long term fitness, Tindall ended his eight-year association with Bath. He joined their West Country rivals Gloucester Rugby on a three-year deal worth ¬£150,000. =Gloucester = After returning from injury in the autumn of 2005, Tindall regained his England place but this time at inside centre. At club level he continued to play at 13 with the 12 shirt going to Henry Paul. The partnership was heavily criticised as being flat and boring and Tindall spent much of the season showing a poor run of form despite selection week in, week out. It wasn't until an incident at Tindall's girlfriend's birthday party that Henry Paul broke club rules and fell out of favour with Gloucester Rugby coach, Dean Ryan. This brought in the introduction of young centre Anthony Allen, which towards the end of the season helped forge the start of a very powerful centre partnership. His partnership with Jamie Noon for England was much criticised, with many people claiming that the bulky partnership lacked imagination and play-making ability. Tindall has a strong cult following however, and is often nicknamed \\"The Fridge\\" due to his sizeable bulk. Mike Tindall with the Webb Ellis Cup During his recuperation from another injury in 2005, Tindall entered the British Poker Open tournament, finishing in 3rd place in his heat before being eliminated by John Gale. On 18 November 2006 Tindall made his first Guinness Premiership start of the season against third-placed Wasps. Troubled by a calf injury so far into the 2006/07 season, he had made only two appearances as a replacement, against Worcester and Irish. Tindall came back from his injury however with a much more highly rated run of form. Tindall was again included in the England starting line up for the 2007 Six Nations opener against Scotland at Twickenham, under new head coach Brian Ashton, selected to play outside former rugby league footballer Andy Farrell. In April 2007 playing away against Newcastle Falcons in the Guinness Premiership, Tindall broke his leg in a tackle on Toby Flood and this forced him to miss the rest of the season, including the Guinness Premiership final. This also precluded his selection for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In October 2007, after recovering from injury, Tindall returned to the Gloucester starting line up, against Worcester Warriors at home, in the Guinness Premiership. Tindall had a fairytale comeback, scoring a try to the Shed's delight. On 7 December 2007 against Bourgoin in the Heineken Cup, Tindall limped off the field with a shin injury sustained in a similar tackle from that against Newcastle the previous season when he broke his leg. Despite this injury, Tindall recovered quickly and played the following week, continuing his form for Gloucester. In February 2008 Tindall was named in England head coach Brian Ashton's squad for the upcoming Six Nations Championship, and thus started for England at outside centre against Wales at Twickenham on 2 February 2008. During the match, he was accidentally kicked in the chest by winger Mark Jones and had to be stretchered off. He had attempted to win possession just as Jones was kicking the ball away. He was ruled out of the tournament with internal bleeding and a perforated liver. Tindall stated in a press conference that he was happy just to be alive after his injury, but was looking forward to returning to the field for Gloucester in what he hoped would be towards the \\"business end of the season\\" (April). In January 2008, Tindall announced a new three-year deal signed to remain at Gloucester until the end of the 2011 season. In April 2012, Gloucester announced that Tindall would be one of a group of 11 players not playing for the club next season. However, in June 2012, he agreed a one- year contract as a player and backs coach at Gloucester. In May 2013, he signed a new contract to remain player-backs coach for another year. On 15 July 2014, Tindall announced his retirement from professional rugby. =Minchinhampton RFC= Since retiring, Tindall has gone back to grass roots rugby and is playing and coaching with amateur club Minchinhampton RFC, who compete in Gloucester 2. Tindall made his debut against Gloucester All Blues in October 2014. Minchinhampton RFC is conveniently located for Tindall next to Gatcombe Park where he lives. =2011 Rugby World Cup misconduct= On 11 November 2011, Tindall was fined ¬£25,000 by the Rugby Football Union and was removed from its elite player squad as a result of his throwing a dwarf in Queenstown, New Zealand during the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Martin Johnson, the England manager, had initially supported Tindall, but it later became clear that management, including Johnson, had been misled. After a formal enquiry, the RFU said that Tindall's actions were unacceptable and would not be tolerated. Tindall said he intended to appeal against the decision. On 28 November 2011 the appeal partly succeeded. Tindall's suspension from the England squad was set aside and the fine was reduced to ¬£15,000. One of the reasons given for his partially successful appeal was that he had not intentionally misled Johnson, because he did not remember the relevant events. Tindall was filmed flirting with an unknown woman at a bar in Queenstown, New Zealand, during the 2011 Rugby World Cup A bouncer uploaded security camera footage of the incident to YouTube, and was later charged with accessing a computer system for a dishonest purpose. =Barbarians= Tindall was selected for the Barbarians squad on their short tour in May 2012 against England at Twickenham, Ireland at Kingsholm Stadium, Gloucester and Wales at the Millennium Stadium. In May 2013, Tindall captained the Barbarians against England at Twickenham. Tindall was named a replacement for the Barbarians against the British and Irish Lions as part of their 2013 tour to Australia. Personal life On 21 December 2010, it was announced that Tindall was engaged to Zara Phillips, only daughter of Anne, Princess Royal, and her first husband Captain Mark Phillips. Phillips is the eldest granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The couple first met during the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia. As required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772, since repealed, the Queen gave her consent to their marriage in a meeting of the Privy Council on 10 May 2011.Privy Council Orders for 10 May 2011 The wedding was held on 30 July 2011 at Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh, with the attendance of all senior members of the royal family. On 17 January 2014, it was announced that Zara had given birth to a baby girl at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. The couple named their daughter Mia Grace Tindall. Mia was christened on 30 November 2014 at St Nicholas's church in the village of Cherington in Gloucestershire. Two of Zara's pregnancies ended in miscarriage, before their second daughter, Lena Elizabeth Tindall, was born on 18 June 2018, at Stroud Maternity Hospital. Tindall has two criminal convictions for drunk-driving.Road Traffic Act 1988 s 5(1) Tindall, whose nose was broken at least eight times during his rugby career, underwent a surgery in 2018 which fixed the fractures. Celebrity ambassador Tindall has appeared as the host for a number of charity sporting events, including a golf classic sponsored by the Legion Foundation every year to raise money for the On Course Foundation and Rugby for Heroes. In 2012, Tindall became the charity ambassador for The Midlands Air Ambulance. In late 2013, Tindall became a brand ambassador for online trading company UFXMarkets. Since 2013, Tindall has been hosting a charity golf day annually called ISPS HANDA Mike Tindall Celebrity Golf Classic with people from fields including rugby, golf and entertainment. It aims to raise funds for charities helping people with disabilities and curing Parkinson's disease, such as the Matt Hampson Foundation and the Cure Parkinson's Trust, and also those involving military personnel making the transition to civilian life such as Rugby for Heroes. Tindall is also the principal patron of both the Matt Hampson Foundation and Rugby for Heroes. In April 2015 Tindall became a brand ambassador for online bookmaker Betway. Tindall has been increasing his involvement with Right To Play since his introduction to their work in 2015. In October 2015, he visited one of their programmes in Accra, Ghana, which he said had a profound effect on him. In December 2016, Tindall was announced as an Athlete Ambassador for the charity Right To Play UK, which uses play to educate and empower children to overcome the effects of poverty, conflict and disease in disadvantaged communities. In January 2018, he participated in And They're Off! in aid of Sport Relief.

It opened in 1774, and was closed in 1866, when it was declared to be a public health hazard. Four years later it reopened with a better water supply, and closed for the second time in 1922. It was subsequently filled in, although consideration has been given to restoring it. There are some remains, including a short section of canal at the junction and a pumping station building, which is now a dwelling. History The first plans to provide a navigable route to Bradford were made in 1744, when a number of Gentlemen and Farmers sought parliamentary approval for improvements to of the River Aire, starting at Inghay Bridge, near Skipton, and ending at Cottingley Bridge, near Bingley, which was the nearest point on the river from which an existing road ran to Bradford. Although the bill reached the committee stage, nothing more became of it. When the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was promoted in the 1760s, its course between Skipton and Bingley broadly followed that proposed by the 1744 plan. It was authorised in 1770, and in the same year fourteen merchants, including six who were already on the committee for the Leeds and Liverpool, planned a branch which would serve the town of Bradford. An Act of Parliament was obtained on 29 April 1771, which appointed 28 proprietors. They could raise ¬£6,000 in capital by issuing shares, with a further ¬£3,000 if needed, to be used to construct a canal from Shipley to a place in Bradford called Hoppy Bridge, which is now below Forster Square. They could also build reservoirs, and take water from various brooks. The canal ran for , dropping by through 10 locks on its way from Bradford to Shipley. Abraham Balme, one of the original promoters, oversaw the construction, with John Longbotham giving engineering advice. The locks on the canal were , and could accommodate boats drawing . The sizes were the same as those of the neighbouring Leeds and Liverpool. The work was completed by March 1774, when Mr Balme paid for the bell ringers of Bradford to ring out his arrival by boat. The Leeds and Liverpool opened from Bingley to Thackley in the same month. The opening was a year later than planned, and the canal had cost ¬£9,424 14s 2d to build, about ¬£3,500 over budget. Initially the main cargo was stone, as a number of kilns were built beside the canal by the Bradford Lime Kiln Company and limestone was brought from Skipton. Coal pit owners on the south side of Bradford in Broomfields and Bowling built tramways into the town but there was no direct connection with the canal as possible routes were blocked by buildings. In about 1790 the newly established Bowling Iron Works constructed a wagon-way from its works in Bowling to a staithes at Golden Lyon Yard about 200 yards south of the canal basin. Finished iron products and coal were exported from the town by the canal via the wagon-way. The carriage of wool from Australia was an important source of revenue from the 1820s, and from 1828, packet boats carried passengers to Selby and Leeds. =Difficulties= Water supply was a significant issue for the canal company. As Bradford grew, the basin was surrounded by housing, and pollution from sewage occurred. Further down, mills drew water from the canal, used it for industrial processes, and returned it to the canal. The Company had bought up tracts of land at the end of the 18th century, to obtain water rights, and had dammed Bradford Beck, despite the fact that their authorising Act of Parliament had specifically excluded it as a source of water. The Bradford Board of Surveyors commented on the filth and stench in a report made in 1844, and an outbreak of cholera five years later, in which 406 people died, prompted the city council to take action. A wide-ranging sanitation bill was prepared, which included a clause to buy the canal and close it. The action would be funded by a ¬£100,000 public loan. The bill went before parliament, but concerted opposition by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, the Aire and Calder Navigation, the Bradford Canal and other industrialists succeeded in reducing the amount of the loan to ¬£50,000, which was insufficient to enable the canal to be purchased. Hot weather in 1864 led to a fund being opened, so that a court order could be used to close the canal, on the basis that it was a public nuisance. A local newspaper, The Bradford Observer, described it as \\"that seething cauldron of all impurity, the Bradford Canal.\\" Although the Company argued that the water was polluted before it entered the canal, an injunction prevented them from taking water from the Bradford Beck after 6 November 1866. An offer by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to take it over and clean it up was rejected by those who had brought the court order. Closure was postponed until 1 May 1867, while both the Bradford Company and the Leeds and Liverpool attempted to obtain an Act of Parliament, but both failed, and so the canal closed and was drained. With no means to transport their stone, several merchants started to negotiate with the Leeds and Liverpool, the Aire and Calder and Bradford Council. A new company, called the Bradford Canal Company Limited, was formed, and bought most of the canal from the old company for ¬£2,500. The section above Northbrook Bridge was sold to developers, and on 21 March 1870, the old company was wound up. The new company expected to get a water supply from two reservoirs and three streams, and hoped to supplement this with a pipeline running from the top of the Leeds and Liverpool's Bingley locks. This suggestion was refused, and they resorted to building steam pumping engines at each lock, to pump water up the canal. The section from Shipley to Oliver Lock was reopened in 1872, five years to the day since it had closed, and the top section was reopened the following April. Although the stone traffic, which had been around 125,000 tons per year prior to closure, returned, most of the other traffic had moved to the railway, and did not. Receipts were inadequate to make the canal pay, and so the owners sold it to a coalition of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Aire and Calder Navigation. They received ¬£27,000, and the buyers also redeemed a ¬£5,000 mortgage. The sale was authorised by the Bradford Canal (Transfer) Act, which was passed in 1878, and the new Bradford Canal Company was dissolved. Traffic rose from 80,674 tons in 1888 to 102,390 tons in 1910, but profits were minimal due to the cost of maintenance. Traffic decreased during the First World War, and was down to 38,821 tons in 1920. With no obvious way to return the canal to profit, a bill to abandon the canal was submitted to Parliament in 1921, but was opposed by West Riding County Council, Bradford Corporation, and the Bradford Chamber of Commerce. A second attempt the following year was successful, the Bradford Canal (Abandonment) Act being passed in June 1922. Closure occurred on 25 June, with just the section from the Leeds and Liverpool canal to the bottom of the first lock being retained, to be used as moorings. Subsequently, much of the canal's route has been built upon and filled in. Apart from the junction, several of the bridges which once spanned it are still visible in whole or in part. Near the site of the first lock is a lock keepers cottage and the pumping station building, which has been restored and is used as a dwelling. Regeneration plan In the early years of the 21st century, there is a plan to rebuild the Bradford Canal. Among the many projects conceived in connection with Bradford's bid to be European Capital of Culture for 2008 (which competition was actually won by Liverpool), one was a scheme to recreate Bradford Canal. In 2004 Bradford Council, British Waterways, and Bradford Centre Regeneration jointly established a committee to investigate the possibilities of a new canal. According to \\"Canal Road News\\", a full feasibility study has \\"concluded that reinstating Bradford Canal is feasible, represents value for money, and opens considerable development opportunities along the five-kilometre canal corridor\\". Issue 1 of \\"Canal Road News\\" shows a map of the proposed canal: it more or less follows the original path from the Leeds and Liverpool Canal as far as Queens Road bridge. But south of that bridge the map shows it crossing Canal Road, and continuing on the west (city) side of that road, past the Conditioning House and finishing at the proposed Channel Urban Village. The plan shows 11 locks. Another noteworthy item on the map, not directly related to the canal, is a potential Manningham station on the Airedale Line. According to a newspaper article of April 2006, \\"Ambitious plans for a new canal between Shipley and Bradford have been given a cautious welcome by members of the construction industry. ... After the presentation, many of the audience said the plans were exciting and could stimulate regeneration. But others were more cautious and questioned where funding would come from.\\" By April 2010, Bradford Council owned 63 per cent of the route for the renewed canal, and was considering how best to acquire the rest, which was in private ownership at the time. A feasibility study by the civil engineers Arup and the architects Lathams identified the potential for regeneration that such a scheme would have.

It stretches from La Rambla to Via Laietana, and from the Mediterranean seafront to the Ronda de Sant Pere. It is a part of Ciutat Vella district. The quarter encompasses the oldest parts of the city of Barcelona, and includes the remains of the city's Roman wall and several notable medieval landmarks. Much of the present-day fabric of the quarter, however, dates to the 19th and early 20th centuries. El Call, the medieval Jewish quarter, is located within this area, along with the former Sinagoga Major. The Barri G√≤tic retains a labyrinthine street plan, with many small streets opening out into squares. Most of the quarter is closed to regular traffic although open to service vehicles and taxis. Authenticity of the Gothic Quarter Barcelona Cathedral in the 1880s, before neo-Gothic additions to its fa√ßade Despite its name, a number of landmark Gothic buildings in the neighborhood do not date to the Middle Ages. Rather, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the quarter was completely transformed from a sombre neighborhood to a tourist attraction through a massive restoration project, timed to be completed for the 1929 International Exhibition. This allowed the city and the surrounding region of Catalonia to portray itself in a positive light to the world's media. Further restoration of existing buildings and the creation of brand new neo-Gothic structures continued as late as the 1960s. Among the principal buildings with rebuilt or modified with neo-Gothic additions are: *The fa√ßade of the Barcelona Cathedral: constructed between 1882 and 1913 by Josep Oriol Mestres and August Font i Carreras with a profusion of Gothic-style elements. *Building of the Centre Excursionista de Catalunya () on Carrer Parad√≠s: work by Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner carried out in 1922 on a building of uncertain origins, to which he added Gothic windows, battlements, and merlons. *The Flamboyant-style bridge that crosses Carrer Bisbe between the Palau de la Generalitat and the Cases dels Canonges: newly constructed 1928 by Joan Rubi√≥. *Casa Padell√†s: currently the Barcelona City History Museum headquarters, the building was built circa 1500 on Carrer Mercaders, but it was moved to the Pla√ßa del Rei in 1931 with its interior rebuilt. *Aguilar Palace: present-day Museu Picasso (Carrer Montcada), restored by Adolf Florensa in 1959, who added galleries with arches and Gothic windows. *Pignatelli Palace: present-day Royal Artistic Circle of Barcelona, restored in 1970 including the addition of various Gothic windows retrieved from municipal warehouses.

Its inhabitants are called Nisseni. In 2017, the city had a population of 62,797. It is the 14th largest comune in Italy measured by area, the sixth highest comune in Italy by elevation (568 m), the second highest elevation in Sicily after the city of Enna (912 m). Its patron saint is Archangel Michael. Geography The town lies in an area of rolling hills with small villages and towns, crossed by the river Salso. It borders on the municipalities of Canicatt√¨, Delia, Enna, Marianopoli, Mazzarino, Sicily, Mussomeli, Naro, Petralia Sottana, Pietraperzia, San Cataldo, Santa Caterina Villarmosa, Serradifalco and Sommatino. Its frazioni are the villages of Bifaria, Borgo Petilia, Borgo Canicass√® Casale, Cozzo di Naro, Favarella, Prestianni, Villaggio Santa Barbara, Santa Rita and Xirbi. =Territory= Caltanissetta dominates the whole valley of the river Salso, which extends to include the nearby Enna. Morphologically it matches the surrounding area, very harsh and composed of limestone and clay. The city lies between three hills (Sant'Anna, Monte San Giuliano, and Poggio Sant'Elia), which form a basin which comprise part of the historical centre and South. =The Maccalube of Terrapellata= The Maccalube (singular: Maccaluba, from Arabic maql≈´bah, '(a land) that turns over', from the verb qalaba 'to turn over, to turn upside down, to invert') are a particularly rare phenomenon of sedimentary volcanism occurring in the Terrapellata area of Caltanissetta, the so-called Hill of the Volcanoes, near the village of Santa Barbara. This is an area of barren hills, with a colour ranging from white to dark grey, where mud volcanoes of around one meter in height rest on volcanic sediment. The phenomenon is related to the presence of extensive underground clay deposits, interspersed with layers of salt water. Maccaluba is created by ejection of methane gas bubbles under pressure. When gas breaks through the clay deposits, it creates channels as it rises to the surface. These channels permit the clay sediment and water to travel, especially when they are pressured from beneath. The consistency of the soft clay and water 'sludge' erupting as a mixture then forms a clay cone on the surface, the top of which is similar in appearance to a volcanic crater. These formations remains soft for some time, unlike the igneous rock eruptions and cones often associated with volcanoes such as Mount Etna. The Maccalube Emergency of August 2008 On 20 August 2008 a State of Emergency was declared because of events involving the Santa Barbara district in Caltanissetta in the preceding days. During the morning of August 11, 2008 geological instability caused the opening of rifts in the ground surface, varying from ten centimetres to a metre in diameter. Damage to buildings occurred in two areas up to distant, the Maccalube and in the western part of the City Centre. These damages were made worse by an eruption of clay-mud, water and gas which occurred some hours later that same day. For seven minutes, a sizable eruption created a mud deposit thick and wide, across a large area. On August 19, the first manifestations of further Maccalube eruptions appeared on top of the mud layer, where water and mud had been ejected by the previous eruption. The Terrapelata phenomenon has been known for at least two centuries. The local Abbot, Salvatore Li Volsi (1797‚Äì1834), an expert in natural and agricultural sciences, wrote Sul vulcano aereo di Terrapilata in Caltanissetta (\\"Regarding the aerial volcano of Terrapelata in Caltanissetta\\"). He describes similar events which had occurred between 1783 and 1823, which he attributed to large-scale instability in the area. In recent decades these events have gradually become less violent, creating relatively inactive Maccalube, rather than violent eruptions and rifts in the terrain. As of September 2008: 68 craters out of 98 were said to be active; 17 were dormant; those remaining were thought to have solidified. The events of August 11 are similar to those of February 14 and 15, 2002. Those of August were characteristic of a more severe eruption and of instability of the terrain beneath the populated area of the town. These events had, in the past, extended even further into the city area; but they had never before happened at the same time as eruptions. History Caltanissetta's origins can be traced back to 406 BC, when admiral Nicia of Hamilcar's siege force from Carthage established a fort at the site, later called Castra Nicia (Fort Nicia). After the Second Punic War, Castra Nicia came under Roman rule, but as in the rest of Sicily, the influence of the invaders remained superficial. In AD 829, the city was occupied by the Saracens. The Carthaginian name, similar to the Arabic word nisƒÅ‚Äô (meaning 'women') resulted in the Saracen name Qal‚Äòat al-NisƒÅ‚Äô ('Fort of the Women'), since Italianized to Caltanissetta. The settlement was captured by the Normans in 1086. A charter was granted to the town in accordance with Count Roger Borsa's vast plan for the urbanisation of Sicily, and the urban plan that is still in evidence today was laid out. After the Norman occupation the city was under the rule of the Hohenstaufen, the Anjou and the Aragonese kings, who gave it the title of 'County'. It was here that Frederick II of Sicily was proclaimed king. The city was the seat of another Parliament which aimed to settle the disputes which had arisen during the reign of Frederick III (1355‚Äì1377). In 1406 Caltanissetta became a fiefdom of the noble Spanish family Moncada, which already owned the Estate of Patern√≤, and subsequently the area fell into great decay. Construction of the Cathedral began in 1539, and, notably, in 1566 a bridge was built over the Salso River. In this period the city began to expand outside the walls, with creation of the new areas of(Santa Flavia, San Rocco degli Zingari and San Francesco. These included the medieval village of Arab origin. The areas were separated by two roads which crossed roughly perpendicularly to a central square (now Piazza Garibaldi): the current Corso Vittorio Emanuele (west-east) and the Corso Umberto I (north-south). On July 8, 1718 the city was assaulted by Piedmontese troops, causing large loss of life to the population. In 1787 Johann Wolfgang Goethe visited Caltanissetta. In 1812, the Moncada seignory ended after a rule of 406 years, when the feudal constitution was abolished and Caltanissetta was turned into the 22nd Comarca of Sicily. In 1819 the city was declared to be the Capital of the province. However one year later it was sacked as a punishment for its loyalty to the House of Bourbon. In 1844 it was elevated to a Bishopric seat. After many Nisseni had taken part in his Thousands deeds, Giuseppe Garibaldi entered the city, together with Cesare Abba and Alexandre Dumas, p√®re. On October 22 of the same year a Plebiscite declared Caltanissetta to be part of the new Kingdom of Italy. After the Unification of Italy the area experienced an economic boom, largely due to extensive mining of sulfur. The mining was accompanied by various misfortunes: on the 27th of April 1867 47 people died due to a fire-damp explosion in the Trabonella mine; 65 miners died on November 12, 1881 in Gessolungo mine because of an explosion; and another 51 died in 1911 in Deliella and Trabonella mines. In 1875, however, the population rose up against the Prefect, who was subsequently fired. On April 8, 1878 the city was connected to a railway, ending the historical difficulties in reaching it. Three years later the King Umberto I visited Caltanissetta along with his wife Margherita of Savoy and his son Victor Emmanuel III. During the Second World War, as part of the Allied landing in Sicily( in July 1943), Caltanissetta suffered several bombings during which 351 civilians were killed. On July 10, 1943 U.S. 3rd Infantry troops landed in Licata and 8 days later, on 18 July they entered and occupied the city. The U.S. 1st infantry landed in Gela some hours later and advanced toward Catania to meet the U.S 45th Infantry, which had landed near Scoglitti. War-damaged Cathedral, 18 July 1943 Government Economy Caltanissetta's economy remained heavily reliant on agriculture until the 19th century, when sulfur mining industry began extensively. 275 sulfur mines were created in the province, employing 32,000 workers. Fratelli Averna SpA, a firm in the city, produces the Amaro Averna, a liqueur sold throughout Italy and beyond. Nevertheless, Caltanissetta has long been stricken by poverty, especially its West side. Main sights The city's monuments include: *The Palazzo Moncada, erected in 1635 by the Count Guglielmo Moncadaa. This was not completed as Guglielmo left Sicily upon his appointment as Viceroy of Valencia. The fa√ßade is finely decorated with noteworthy friezes, in zoomorphic and anthropomorphic baroque styles. Flemish painter Guglielmo Borremans (1722). *The Cathedral of Santa Maria la Nova, built between the years 1560‚Äì1620, was opened to the public in 1622. The fa√ßade was only completed in the year 1840. The church has a late-Renaissance appearance that breaks the characteristic Baroque mold usual to Sicily. The interior features frescoes by Guglielmo Borremans, who worked there from 1722. Other works include a wooden Blessed Virgin draped with silver lamina (1760) and a poly- chromatic wooden statue of St. Michael the Archangel by the sculptor Stefano Li Volsi, which is located in a large aisle chapel, along with two marble statues portraying Archangels Gabriel and Raphael, sculpted by Vincenzo Vitaliano. The Treasury houses a fine silver monstrance from the 15th century. *The Church of St. Agatha at College with its poly-chromatic marble was built between 1600 and 1610, in late-Renaissance style, on the site of a previous church, which had also been dedicated to St. Agatha. The fa√ßade was created by Natale Masuccio, and is decorated with frameworks on a light coloured background. It has a Greek cross plant, with splendid Baroque decorations including frescoes by Luigi Borremans (18th century). The work on the adjacent Jesuit College began in 1589 and were completed in the second half of the 19th century. The fa√ßade of the Church of San Sebastiano in the foreground with the Triton Fountain. *The Church of San Sebastiano dates from the 16th century and is located in Piazza Garibaldi, in front of the Cathedral. It was built as a tribute to said Saint by the people in gratitude for deliverance from the plague. In 1711 it was altered along its whole length to make space for the Piazza Garibaldi. As a result, a new fa√ßade was designed by Pasquale Saetta in the late 19th century. It is embellished with columns employing all three classical architectural orders: Doric bases, Ionicin central sections and Corinthian crowns. There are also niches containing statues of the sculptor Francesco Biangardi, who worked in Caltanissetta during the late 19th century. The centre sculptures represent the saints Peter and Paul; the upper band shows San Sebastian pierced with arrows, being created in memory of his martyrdom. *The Church of San Domenico, (16th century, with a convex fa√ßade from the 18th century), houses noteworthy paintings by Guglielmo Borremans and Filippo Paladini's (Madonna del Rosario). Paladini's painting depicting the Madonna del Carmelo is now situated in the Cathedral. *The Palazzo Vescovile (\\"Bishop's Palace\\") is the seat of the Museum of Sacred Art. It has a painting by Gian Battista Corradini of the Madonna del Rosario (1614). *The Church of the Santa Croce (\\"Holy Cross\\") dates originally from the 17th century, though substantially altered since. Caltanissetta has three museums: the Diocesan Museum; the Mineralogical Museum; the Regional Archeological Museum. The latter holds displays mostly from prehistoric times and includes finds from archeological digs conducted in the 1950s. These include vases and tools from the Bronze Age, and early Sicilian ceramics. Sites in the neighbourhood of Caltanissetta include: *The Castle of Pietrarossa (\\"Red Stone Castle\\"), built using, as its name suggests, largely red stones, dominates the city and the whole Salso River valley from the edge of the ravine upon which it stands. Originally assumed to have been built at the time of Arab rule, it is currently generally accepted that the castle was built by the Byzantines between 750 and 800 AD. During the Middle Ages the castle was a strategic stronghold. Around the end of the 11th century the tomb of Queen Adelasia, niece of the Norman King Roger I, was placed here. In 1378 a Parliament of The Barons was held there, to name the four vicars that were to govern Sicily (Government of the (Four Vicars) Benevento - Quattri Vicari, 1377-1410). 1407 saw the castle become the property of the Moncada family from Spain, and thus began the Castle's subsequent period of decline. Having been deemed unsuitable as a noble residence, it was used only for military functions. At the end of the 15th century, the castle dungeons were used as prisons. In 1567 a strong earthquake caused the collapse of the castle. Only the ruins of two towers, still visible today, remained standing. *The Abbey of the Santo Spirito (Holy Spirit), built by the Norman Count Ruggero and his wife Queen Adelasia in 1092‚Äì1098, was consecrated in 1153. It has been greatly altered in subsequent centuries. The original outlines are still identifiable to the rear, where its characteristic massive jutting apses can be seen. These are separated by flat pilasters and connected by a series of small arches. The left-hand entrance has an ogival portal from the 13th century. The lunette once contained a figure of Christ Blessing, which was eventually moved inside the Abbey. Notable are the rectangular nave and wooden-beamed ceiling. The walls and the apses have frescoes attributed to the 14th century. The vault of the apse shows a 17th-century figure of Christ Pantocrator. *The Archeological Park of Gibil Gabib, on a hill near the city, contains, amongst other things, the defense tower and parts of the perimeter walls dating back to the 6th century. Transport Caltanissetta is served by the A19 motorway Palermo-Catania, with an exit linking to the Town Centre via a highway. The town has two railway stations: Caltanissetta Centrale on the Caltanissetta-Agrigento line and Caltanissetta Xirbi, on the Palermo-Catania line. Media Caltanissetta is also the site of a Short-wave transmitter, broadcasting RAI. (The Long-wave transmitter was shut down in 2002).

It is near the village of Thiepval, Picardy in France. A visitors' centre opened in 2004. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, Thiepval has been described as \\"the greatest executed British work of monumental architecture of the twentieth century\\". Location The Memorial was built approximately to the south-east of the former Thiepval Ch√¢teau, which was located on lower ground, by the side of Thiepval Wood. The grounds of the original ch√¢teau were not chosen as this would have required the moving of graves, dug during the war around the numerous medical aid stations. Design and inauguration Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the memorial was built between 1928 and 1932 and is the largest Commonwealth Memorial to the Missing in the world. It was inaugurated by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) in the presence of Albert Lebrun, President of France, on 1 August 1932. The unveiling ceremony was attended by Lutyens. The memorial dominates the rural scene and has 16 brick piers, faced with Portland stone. It was originally built using French bricks from Lille, but was refaced in 1973 with Accrington brick. The main arch is aligned east to west. The memorial is high, above the level of its podium, which to the west is above the level of the adjoining cemetery. It has foundations thick, which were required because of extensive wartime tunnelling beneath the structure. It is a complex form of memorial arch, comprising interlocking arches of four sizes. Each side of the main arch is pierced by a smaller arch, orientated at a right angle to the main arch. Each side of each of these smaller arches is then pierced by a still smaller arch and so on. The keystone of each smaller arch is at the level of the spring of the larger arch that it pierces; each of these levels is marked by a stone cornice. This design results in 16 piers, having 64 stone-panelled sides. Only 48 of these are inscribed, as the panels around the outside of the memorial are blank. More succinctly, according to the architectural historian Stephen Games, the memorial is composed of two intersecting triumphal arches, each with a larger central arch and two smaller subsidiary arches, the arches on the east-west facades being taller than those on the north-south, and all raised up from what is loosely a square four-by-four tartan grid plan. The main arch is surmounted by a tower. In the central space of the memorial a Stone of Remembrance rests on a three-stepped platform. The memorial represents the names 72,246 officers and men (see below), and Lutyens's ingenious geometry arises out of the attempt to display these names in compact form, rather than in the longer, lower and linear form taken by other memorials to the missing of the war, such as those at Loos, Pozi√®res and Arras. Inscriptions The inscription of names on the memorial is reserved for those missing, or unidentified, soldiers who have no known grave. A large inscription on an internal surface of the memorial reads: On the Portland stone piers are engraved the names of over 72,000 men who were lost in the Somme battles between July 1915 and March 1918. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission states that over 90% of these soldiers died in the first Battle of the Somme between 1 July and 18 November 1916. The names are carved using the standard upper-case lettering designed for the Commission by MacDonald Gill. Over the years since its inauguration, bodies have been regularly discovered on the former battlefield and are sometimes identified through various means. The decision was taken that to protect the integrity of the memorial as one solely for those who are missing or unidentified, that if a body were found and identified the inscription of their name would be removed from the memorial by filling in the inscription with cement. For those who are found and identified, they are given a funeral with full military honours at a cemetery close to the location at which they were discovered. This practice has resulted in numerous gaps in the lists of names. On the top of the archway, a French inscription reads: Aux arm√©es Fran√ßaise et Britannique l'Empire Britannique reconnaissant (To the French and British Armies, from the grateful British Empire). Just below this, are carved the years 1914 and 1918. On the upper edges of the side archways, split across left and right, is carved the phrase \\"The Missing / of the Somme\\". The 'Somme 1916' roundel Also included on this memorial are sixteen stone laurel wreaths, inscribed with the names of sub-battles that made up the Battle of the Somme and subsequent actions in which the men commemorated at Thiepval fell. One is simply titled 'Somme 1916'. Thirteen battles so-named on the other roundels are Ancre Heights, Ancre, Albert, High Wood, Delville Wood, Morval, Flers‚ÄìCourcelette, Pozi√®res Wood, Bazentin Ridge, Thiepval Ridge, Transloy Ridges, Ginchy, and Guillemont. The final two roundels are for 'Bapaume' and 'Miraumont', most likely referring to battles or actions in the Somme frontline in 1917 as the Thiepval Memorial includes the missing dead that fell before 20 March 1918.

Flanked by two towers of black stone, it was built in the 14th century and was the birthplace of General Lafayette in 1757. In 1916, a group of wealthy philanthropists led by Scottish-born American industrialist John C. Moffat purchased the castle to serve as a center of philanthropy for people affected by World War I.\\"Americans buy Lafayette's Home,\\" The Sacred Heart Review, Volume 57, Number 4, 6 January 1917, p. 3. Following the war he renovated it completely to preserve documents and objects relating to General Lafayette. The Ch√¢teau de Chavaniac is now a museum open to the public.  History  350pxThe Ch√¢teau de Chavaniac was constructed in the 14th century. It was partially destroyed by a fire in 1701. General Lafayette was born here in 1757. He was married in 1774 to Adrienne de Noailles. They had four children together: Henriette, who died at a young age, Anastasie, Georges and Virginie who lived in the castle. A hero of the American and French revolutions, he was rejected by the French revolutionaries when he voted against the death of King Louis XVI. With the fall of the monarchy, he tried to flee to the United States through the Dutch Republic. He was captured by Austrians and was made prisoner by Austria at the fortress of Olmutz. He was considered a traitor for not saving the life of Marie-Antoinette, an Austrian by birth, and the king. Lafayette returned to France in 1797. The ch√¢teau was restored to Lafayette in 1791 but sold by the French Republic when Lafayette fled the country. His aunt later bought the ch√¢teau. In December 1916, a group of philanthropists led by John C. Moffat, and including William A. Chanler, Joseph Choate, Clarence Mackay, George von Lengerke Meyer, John Grier Hibben, and Nicholas Murray Butler, purchased the ch√¢teau for the French Heroes Lafayette Memorial FundLafayette Memorial: French Heroes Lafayette Memorial Fund which was managed by Chanler's estranged wife Beatrice Ashley Chanler.Thomas, Lately.

Parts of the ch√¢teau were used as a school, an orphanage Orphanage - School of Chavaniac and a hospitalLafayette Preventorium (known as the Lafayette Preventorium) until 1920, supported by funds from 150,000 donors. During the post-war period, the ch√¢teau was extensively renovated and furnished with memorabilia from Lafayette and other period pieces. The roof was redone, foundations were stabilized, a tower was rebuilt and the south wing was built in the rear with a square tower. During World War II the ch√¢teau was used as a secret hiding place for Jewish children. John Moffat died in 1966 and was buried with his wife on the grounds of ch√¢teau. The Lafayette Memorial Association Inc. took over management of the ch√¢teau. The museum was renovated in the 1990s with the sponsorship of Merck Sharp Chemical Co. In 2007 the Lafayette Preventorium became a separate institute, the Institut th√©rapeutique, √©ducatif et p√©dagogique. In 2009, the Conseil G√©n√©ral de la Haute-Loire took over management of the ch√¢teau and repaired the roof. The French and American flags fly permanently over the ch√¢teau in honor of the key role Lafayette played in the French and American revolutions.  Architecture  The Ch√¢teau de Chavaniac framed by two towers of black rock from Auvergne was constructed in the 14th century. The ch√¢teau and the interior decoration were listed as historic monuments by France on August 21, 1989. Ch√¢teau de Chavaniac In the entrance one finds a great staircase, a gallery with painted murals, a Louis XIII dining room, and a guardroom. The first floor has a grand salon, a library, and the family's bedrooms. The second floor has a great hall and the master bedroom with a bathroom and a sauna. The Franco-American friendship room is found on the fourth floor.

It also advocates further self-governance in the Celtic nations and ultimately for each nation to be an independent state in its own right.Current Campaigns, celticleague.net. Retrieved 26 February 2016. The Celtic League is an accredited NGO with roster consultative status to ECOSOC (The United Nations Economic and Social Council). Aims The Celtic League presents its aims as including: * \\"Fostering co-operation between Celtic peoples.\\" * \\"Developing the consciousness of the special relationship and solidarity between them.\\" * \\"Making our national struggles and achievements better known abroad.\\" * \\"Campaigning for a formal association of Celtic nations to take place once two or more of them have achieved self-government.\\" * \\"Advocating the use of the national resources of each of the Celtic countries for the benefit of all its people.\\" \\"Each Celtic nation is conditioned by a different history and so we must not expect uniformity of thought, but instead allow diversity to express itself within the Celtic League. In this way, we may better recognise those areas of possible co-operation and eventually formulate a detailed common policy. With this we can work out which kind of relations between our communities will enable them to enjoy freedoms and liberties at both individual and community level.\\" Politically, the Celtic league seeks to create six sovereign states from the six Celtic nations it acknowledges as existing, associated in some way. There is some variation in the understanding of these aims, which ranges from annual general meetings (AGMs), to an actual federation along the lines of the Nordic Council. The 1987 Celtic League Annual General Meeting stated that it: \\"firmly reiterates that the Celtic League has a specific function within Celtia, i.e. to work for the reinstatement of our languages to a viable position, and the attainment of sufficient economic, cultural and political autonomy to guarantee the survival of our civilisation into the 21st century. This emphasis on the languages of our six nations marks us now as distinct cultural communities, and therefore as distinct nations.\\" History Founded in 1961, the present Celtic League grew out of various other pan-Celtic organisations, particularly the Celtic Congress, but with a more political emphasis. Previously, Hugh MacDiarmid and others had suggested something along the same lines. The Celtic League was started at the 1961 National Eisteddfod of Wales, which was held at Rhosllannerchrugog near Wrexham in northeast Wales. Two of the founding members were Gwynfor Evans and J. E. Jones, who were respectively president and secretary-general of the Welsh nationalist political party Plaid Cymru at the time. Interest was expressed by Scottish parties, and also by Breton nationalists. Branches thumb250px \\\\---- alt= There are six main, national branches of the Celtic League in the six Celtic countries, generally known by the Celtic language names of their countries: Ireland is known as √âire, Scotland as Alba, Wales as Cymru, Brittany as Breizh, Cornwall as Kernow and the Isle of Man as Mannin or Mann. When concluding against the inclusion of the historically Celtic regions Galicia and Asturias (Asturies) in Spain, the 1987 Celtic League Annual General Meeting stated that, because the Celtic League's specific function, \\"to work for the reinstatement of our languages ... and the attainment of ... political autonomy\\", must remain undiluted, \\"this AGM considers that it would be condescending and inappropriate to offer a limited status to the applicant nations [i.e., Galicia and Asturias] within the Celtic League.\\" The AGM expressed that it \\"encourage[s] them in their efforts to develop the Celtic elements in their heritage\\" such that \\"from such areas, might come the support and understanding we need to pursue our aims more effectively\\" (in Spain, there are no surviving Celtic languages, although in Galicia there is a minority nationalist movement which seeks independence from the Spanish Kingdom and promotes a Celtic identity as a fundamental aspect of Galician culture). There are various diaspora branches, that play little part in the annual general meetings: A Patagonian branch was founded in the Chubut River Valley, Argentina (the location of y Wladfa, a Welsh colony), at the end of 2009; it remained active , with M√≥nica Jones as secretary and her husband Michael Jones filling an unspecified post. Celtic League, American Branch (CLAB) was founded in New York City in 1974, and has its own newsletter, but reported decreased activity , the same year its domain name, CelticLeague.org, was lost to a cybersquatter. CLAB organized various annual events, including the Pan-Celtic Conference. There is a generalized International Branch for \\"[t]hose living far away from the national branches\\", including prospective Spanish members in Galicia and Asturias; it was active with a website, Celtic-League.org (operated from the Isle of Man), from 2004 through 2010. There has been a separate England Branch, based in London, active at least from 2004 to 2007. (Old CL official website at Manxman.co.im/cleague.) There used to be a branch in Cape Breton Island, Canada, where a small Scottish Gaelic-speaking community still exists; this branch was moribund , though various consultations had taken place in efforts to restart it. The branch was then recorded as being active by 22 January 2015.https://www.celticleague.net/news/branch-reaches-out-to-thousands- through-social-media/ Publications The Celtic League publishes a quarterly magazine, Carn, which highlights political struggles and cultural preservation issues. The articles are produced in the six Celtic languages in addition to English. The cover of the magazine is a map of the six Celtic countries with their respective Celtic-language names beside them. In the past, articles have appeared in French as well. For many years, Carn claimed to be the only regular publication carrying all six Celtic languages. The Celtic League, American Branch (CLAB) prints its own quarterly newsletter, Six Nations, One Soul, which provides news of branch activities and events within the Celtic communities in the United States, publishes letters from members, and reviews books and recordings of Celtic interest. CLAB published at least six issues of a larger semi-annual magazine, Keltoi: A Pan-Celtic Review,from 2006 to 2008. CLAB also produced a wall calendar each year, with art from members, appropriate quotations, and anniversaries; publication ceased with the 2008 issue. Other branches have published their own periodicals from time to time, but few have been very long-lived. =Notable members and former members= Some of the more notable past and present members of the Celtic League have been Plaid Cymru leaders Gwynfor Evans and J. E. Jones, Scottish National Party leaders Winnie Ewing, Robert McIntyre and Rob Gibson, leader of Sinn F√©in Ruair√≠ √ì Br√°daigh, prominent Breton exiles Yann Fou√©r√© and Alan Heusaff, the historian and writer Peter Berresford Ellis, writer Bernard Le Nail, and Manx language revivalist Brian Stowell. American author and linguist Alexei Kondratiev was president of the Celtic League American branch. =Campaigns= The Celtic League also campaigns for a united Ireland, and the return of the Loire-Atlantique department to Brittany. Over the years, the Celtic League has campaigned consistently in support of the languages in Celtic nations, and for the return of ancient artefacts, removed from Celtic countries to museums outside of these areas ‚Äì amongst these are the Lewis chessmen and the Chronicles of Mann. The Manx branch of the Celtic League successfully campaigned for the Calf of Man island to be transferred from the National Trust of England, Wales and Northern Ireland to the local Manx National Heritage. In the mid-1990s, the Celtic League started a campaign to have the word \\"Alba\\" on the Scottish football and rugby tops. Since 2005, the Scottish Football Association have supported the use of Scottish Gaelic on their teams's strip in recognition of the language's revival in Scotland. However, the SRU is still being lobbied to have \\"Alba\\" on the national rugby strip. The Celtic League has also passed a motion to support the general aims of Independence First, which aims for a referendum on Scottish independence. In 2010, the Celtic League sought to prevent retailers selling the flag of England in Cornwall, criticising it as \\"foreign\\". Political status of countries The political status of the Celtic League's suggested six Celtic nations varies widely. Both the UK and France were traditionally very centralised states. The following Celtic nations have some degree of autonomy, although Ireland consists of the territory of two sovereign states: * Ireland: ** Republic of Ireland (26 counties) ‚Äì independent. ** Northern Ireland (6 counties) ‚Äì has a devolved assembly. Was ruled directly by the United Kingdom from 1972-2007. From 1922-1972 Northern Ireland had had its own parliament, but due to the worsening political violence of The Troubles the British army was deployed to the region and direct rule established. Under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement some autonomy and various provisions were granted on a power- sharing basis. Until 2007 various controversies between Unionists and Republicans had caused the government of the United Kingdom to rule directly. Northern Ireland now has its own devolved Assembly since 2007. * The Isle of Man ‚Äì home rule (with the oldest continuous parliament in the world); a British Crown Dependency outside the UK and European Union. * Scotland ‚Äì has had a devolved Parliament since 1999, but voted against becoming an independent country in a 2014 referendum. * Wales ‚Äì has had a devolved Assembly since 1999, and in May 2020 became a Parliament (Senedd Cymru/Welsh Parliament). There is also a campaign for a Cornish Assembly. In 2000 the Cornish Constitutional Convention launched the Declaration for a Cornish Assembly campaign. In less than two years, more than 50,000 people signed the Assembly petition and Lord Whitty, in the House of Lords, recognised that Cornwall has a \\"special case\\" for devolution. On a visit to Cornwall, John Prescott said \\"Cornwall has the strongest regional identity in the UK.\\" Three of the countries are completely within the United Kingdom, one partially, and another is a British dependency. Brittany is part of the French state, and does not have any legislative autonomy, but four d√©partements have some financial autonomy as one of the Regions of France, whilst the fifth d√©partement is in another French region. The Republic of Ireland is completely independent.

It was expected to produce around 70,000 tonnes per year of copper metal and up to 14,000 tonnes per year of cobalt hydroxide. In August 2009, the DRC government revoked First Quantum's license due to a dispute over renegotiating the contract. First Quantum stopped operations in September 2009, throwing about 700 people out of work. First Quantum had spent $750 million on acquiring and developing the property. First Quantum took out an action against the DRC government in the International Chamber of Commerce Court of Arbitration. The Frontier Mine is an open pit copper mine located near Sakania. First Quantum obtained exploration licenses in January 2001 and July 2002. Production began in 2007, and in 2010 the mine yielded 322,700 tonnes of copper. The Lonshi Mine is an open pit copper mine that produces high-grade oxide ore that was transported to Zambia for processing at the Bwana Mkubwa SX/EW plant away. The mine was closed after the governor of Katanga province, Moses Katumbi, banned the export of ore to Zambia, insisting that it should be refined in Katanga. In May 2010 a Congolese court ruled that FQM's Lonshi and Frontier copper mines had been awarded illegally and that they should revert to state-owned Sodimico. According to FQM the ruling was due to FQM's decision to contest the expropriation of their Kolwezi tailings project, which was later sold to the Kazakh mining company Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation.

The Watch, its growth and development, and its inner workings are explored through a series of eight fantasy novels and one short story. These novels generally feature as the protagonist, the Watch Commander Sam Vimes, and take on the general shape of a crime novel, in which the Watch are called on to solve a mysterious crime. In order of publication they are; Guards! Guards! (1989), \\"Theatre of Cruelty\\" (1993) (a short story), Men at Arms (1993), Feet of Clay (1996), Jingo (1997), The Fifth Elephant (1999), Night Watch (2002), Thud! (2005) and Snuff (2011). Besides these main stories, the Watch, and individual members thereof, appear in some form in many of the other Discworld novels, especially those set in Ankh-Morpork. The Watch is also to be the subject of a police procedural television series in development as of 2018, entitled The Watch. Style Pratchett's Watch has been described as part of a longstanding fantasy tradition where the characters of the city watch would \\"rush in and die, or run away\\", with Pratchett's approach to that tradition ranging from parody in the earlier novels to \\"deeper satire\\" in the later ones.The Turtle Moves!: Discworld's Story Unauthorized by Lawrence Watt-Evans Fictional history (before the time the novels are set in) Note: Some of the information repeated below was taken from The Discworld Companion and the 1999 Discworld Diary, which had a City Watch theme, and has not been confirmed in any of the Discworld novels. The \\"Ankh-Morpork Watch & Ward\\" was founded in AM 1561 by King Veltrick I. They had full copper armour and a copper shield inscribed \\"Fabricati Diem, Pvncti Agvnt Celeriter\\" (\\"Make the Day, the Moments Pass Quickly\\", Veltrick's motto). Four days later Veltrick's son assassinated him, and became Veltrick II. Since he had little interest in maintaining a police force, the equipment of the Watch quickly deteriorated. At this time there were four separate forces: * The \\"Palace Guard\\", who guarded the palace. * The \\"Cable Street Particulars\\", a political police force concentrating on discovering \\"plots\\" against the current rulers of the city. The name may have been inspired by the Baker Street Irregulars from the stories of Sherlock Holmes, and perhaps by the Battle of Cable Street, a riot started between Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists and anti-fascist protesters in 1936. They are also known as The Unmentionables (a colloquial British term for underwear), possibly a parody of The Invincibles, an Irish extremist nationalist group, or of The Untouchables, a prohibition-era law-enforcement group, who served as government intelligence. * The \\"Ward\\", who acted as gate- guards, thief-takers etc. during the day. * The \\"Watch\\", who served the same purpose in the hours of darkness. The force comprised one commander, five captains, ten sergeants, forty corporals, lance-corporals, constables and lance-constables, and, in times of emergency, a \\"citizens militia\\" of varied size. Public opinion of the Watches (the Ward became known as the Day Watch) was never high, and reached an all-time low when a Commander, who had told the public not to take the law into their own hands, was thrown onto the Ankh with a cry of \\"If it's not in our hands, whose hands is it in?\\" The Guilds were policing themselves by this point, so the Watch was becoming increasingly irrelevant. The Watch had a brief respite in AM 1688, following the Ankh- Morpork Civil War, when Commander Suffer-Not-Injustice Vimes and his Ironheads became the city's rulers. However, after he was deposed in favour of the Patricianship, the Watch sank even further into obscurity; he was (until recently) the last Watch Commander. Under the rule of the Patricians, not only did Guild Law apply in the Guilds, but the only laws that applied anywhere else were the whims of the man in charge. By the time of Homicidal Lord Winder's rule as Patrician, there were only a handful of Watch Houses remaining. The Cable Street Particulars were thriving, however, having changed from an intelligence agency into a secret police force, employing torture with gusto. During the Glorious Revolution of the Twenty-Fifth of May, their building was burnt down by members of the Night Watch from Treacle Mine Road. The change in Patricians did not lead to an improvement in perceptions of the Watch, and when Lord Vetinari replaced Mad Lord Snapcase, and even theft was legalised, there seemed to be no point to them at all. The dysfunctional Night Watch now comprised three men, based in the old Treacle Mine Road Watch House. While the Day Watch had become another of the city's gangs, the Night Watch was just inactive.  History according to plot of novels  This changed when Constable Carrot Ironfoundersson joined, and the Night Watch saved the city from a dragon. Following the destruction of their Watch House, they moved to larger premises in Pseudopolis Yard (a name reminiscent of Scotland Yard) and started recruiting more members, especially from ethnic minorities such as dwarfs, trolls and the undead. The Watch has even admitted a vampire. When they saved the Patrician's life Vetinari agreed to increase the force's stature, with new Section Houses being built around the city. The remains of the Day Watch were incorporated into a new City Watch, commanded by Sam Vimes. Since then, the Watch has become a proper police force, dealing in crime prevention and investigation, rather than simple \\"thief-taking\\". They now have a forensics section, a Traffic Division and the long-gone Cable Street Particulars have been replaced by a plain-clothes division. A Watch Academy has been set up, although watchmen trained there often get \\"poached\\" by other Sto Plains city-states who have seen the advantages such a force has. Vimes tolerates this, because it is useful that coppers all over the plains have been trained to obey him. Another recent addition are \\"the Specials\\", based on the Watch's ancient right to establish a Citizen's Militia as needed. Known members include the Librarian (who was actually made a Special Constable long before the Militia was set up); Mr Boggis of the Thieves' Guild; Sam Vimes' butler Willikins; and a clacks operative named Andy \\"Two Swords\\" Hancock who carries a disturbing amount of weaponry. The Watch's current motto is \\"FABRICATI DIEM, PVNC\\", as inscribed on the old Treacle Mine Road Watch House; presumably the last part of the original \\"Fabricati Diem, Pvncti Agvnt Celeriter\\" had been lost. This is nonsense in Latin, and doesn't actually mean \\"Make my day, punk\\", although it looks as though it ought to; this is the nature of most \\"Latatian\\" in the books, and is not unusual. Fred Colon insists it means \\"To protect and serve\\". The motto of the Vimes family is \\"Protego et servio\\", or \\"I protect and serve\\". More and more watchmen trained by the City Watch prefer to work in other cities abroad where they can earn good money thanks to their outstanding qualification and ethics. They are referred to as \\"Sammies\\" (similar to \\"Bobbies\\", a term for British police officers derived from the common abbreviation of the first name of Sir Robert Peel, the man credited with the creation of the first regular, uniformed, police service in the UK) and communicate with each other by telegraph (\\"clacks\\"), a reference to real-world Interpol (mentioned in The Night Watch). Members The primary members of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch are (see the linked articles for full details of the characters): =His Grace, The Duke of Ankh, Commander Sir Samuel Vimes= Samuel Vimes is the Commander of the City Watch, it is all he has ever known and he now brings the dirty tricks he learned as a street copper to his new role. He also makes sure to pass these tricks of the trade on to new recruits. Under Sam Vimes, the Watch has strengthened its position, making many enemies (Although the Assassin's Guild no longer accept contracts). In his time in the Watch he has married the richest woman in Ankh- Morpork, Lady Sybil, and had a son with her, young Sam. =Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson= Adopted by dwarfs as an infant after the deaths of his human parents, Carrot grew up down in the mines of the Copperhead mountains. He is \\"six feet tall and nearly as broad across the shoulders\\". His dwarfish name is Kzad-bhat, which, roughly translated, means \\"Head Banger\\", a logical nickname for a man living in a mine built by dwarfs. He was quite surprised the day he was informed that he was human. His adoptive father thought that he ought to go and live amongst humans, and found him a job with the Ankh-Morpork Night Watch under the misapprehension that they were respected and respectable. Carrot was \\"barely 16 years old\\" at this time. Carrot joined the Night Watch while it was only a small group of misfits who ran from evildoers rather than arrest them (see Guards! Guards!). He had difficulty with this attitude, as his \\"old-fashioned\\" view of justice led him to arrest the leader of the entirely legal Thieves' Guild on his first day. He since has learned to understand the city a bit better. The city learned about him as quickly when he won in a fight against every miscreant in the Mended Drum tavern, including the then doorman Detritus the troll. Captain Carrot has made quite a name for himself, rapidly and effortlessly coming to know all of the city's one-million population by name and tax papers. He is big on paperwork and organization and always (often to the dismay of his girlfriend and fellow officer, Angua) takes time to see all sides of a story before getting involved. When Sam Vimes planned to retire after his marriage to Lady Sybil Ramkin, Carrot was named his successor. He is not particularly skilled in comma placement and has a bit of trouble with the whole concept of \\"i before e\\". He is considered \\"the Disc's most linear thinker\\". For instance, as part of a murder investigation, he interviews Death. Carrot is also famous enough that there are action figures of him available (as seen in the novel Hogfather). Carrot's main talents are his genuine interest in and liking for people (particularly when contrasted with his boss and friend, Sam Vimes who \\"doesn't like anybody\\") and his charisma and \\"supernatural likability\\". He is often shown to be able to get people to do things no one else could force them to do, simply by assuming that they will; for example, he has great success in his outreach programs to at-risk Ankh-Morporkian youth by treating them like boy scouts. When he directly commands someone, they find it supremely difficult to disobey (even Vimes is shown on one occasion as being susceptible to this power). However, he prefers not to utilize this extreme of his power except in dire emergencies. Carrot is often thought of as non-threatening, which is a dangerous conclusion if you are the unlucky person who disappoints his honest nature. People think of Carrot as being simple, and the narrator will occasionally point out that this is trueeg in Men at Arms \\\\- however, people often make the mistake of confusing \\"simple\\" with \\"stupid\\". Carrot's simplicity is his cunning. In Soul Music, Carrot adds supplementary questions to the quiz machine in the Mended Drum, asking players who was responsible for recent crimes and frequently making arrests as a result. Carrot often sees the bright side of life. When Angua, a werewolf, tells him that her brother Andrei is stuck in wolf form and is forced to live as a champion sheepdog, Carrot notes that he is a champion. Carrot has also promised Angua that, should she ever follow in her brother Wolfgang's murderous footsteps, he will be the one to stop her. While it is common knowledge that Carrot is the true heir to the throne of Ankh-Morpork, he doesn't acknowledge it, and has even hidden evidence of his royal heritage. The Patrician, Havelock Vetinari, considers him useful for this reason as well as others, as it means that any attempt to start a revolution under the claim of being true heir is impossible, and that if anyone complains that only a king has the authority to do something he does, he can simply defer to Carrot. Carrot himself never uses his royal powers or acknowledges his royal heritage. After having learned about it (Men at Arms), he confides in Vetinari that he wants the people to obey the law because it's the law, not because \\"Captain Carrot is good at being obeyed\\", and that he is content with his job of ringing a bell and yelling that all's well \\"provided of course that 'all is well'\\". Carrot does, however on rare occasions, hint at his royal powers to make things happen. In Jingo, Lord Vetinari gives Sam Vimes the title of Duke, something only a King can do, while Carrot is present‚ÄîVetinari goes so far as to say that he \\"had been reminded\\" that Vimes could have that title. In The Fifth Elephant, when faced with the defection of most members of the Watch under Sergeant Fred Colon (then an Acting-Captain), Carrot puts his (plain and battered) royal sword on a desk in plain sight and reminds Watch members that they had taken an oath to the King, and that the King had not relieved them of it. Carrot is a stereotypical \\"perfect\\" policeman; totally honest, law abiding and determined to be friends with everyone. People of all species can't help wanting to behave well in his presence. He has an attitude of loving everyone. His philosophy of love for everyone has caused distress for Angua. She worries that his love toward her is equal to that he gives everyone else and not special. While he would place the welfare of the public above hers (and his own), when she was in danger he travelled to the rim of the Disc to save her. Carrot's attitude towards his relationship is considered particularly unusual. During Jingo, Angua is kidnapped on a Klatchian ship and the watch pursues them. Carrot does not stand at the front of the ship fraught with worry but, sensibly, gets some sleep so he will be ready to rescue her when they catch up. Although Sam Vimes and the ship's captain see the sense of this, they can't believe that someone in love could be so sensible. In The Art of Discworld Pratchett says that Carrot has a bright future ahead of him, \\"should Lord Vetinari not survive the next assassination attempt\\". He also notes that, although most people envision Carrot as Arnold Schwarzenegger, he is actually modeled after Liam Neeson. In both the Discworld computer game and the BBC Radio production of Guards! Guards! he speaks with a Welsh accent. His character is also reminiscent of Constable Benton Fraser from Due South (who also has a wolf companion) but Carrot and Angua were an item before Due South was broadcast. =Captain Angua von √úberwald= Captain Delphine Angua von √úberwald first appeared in Men at Arms. Angua is a member of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, originally hired as part of an affirmative action plan by Havelock Vetinari. Her physical beauty led colleagues to predict that criminals would be lining up to be arrested by her, but Angua's surprising strength and tough attitude soon made her one of the most feared officers on the Watch. Angua is a werewolf, though she maintains a strict vegetarian diet during her human phase and only eats chickens during her wolf phase, for which she leaves discreet payments afterwards. In the 1999 computer game Discworld Noir, and the 2001 books-on-tape version of Men at Arms, her name is pronounced \\"An- gyoo-uh\\" with a hard \\"g\\". Terry Pratchett writes on the terrypratchettbooks.com forum: \\"it's Ang as in Anger, u as in you, a as in a thing\\". Angua comes from a family of werewolves. She is the daughter of a Baron and Baroness of √úberwald, and has two brothers, Wolfgang and Andrei. Her sister, Elsa, is deceased, killed by Wolfgang, who disguised it as an accident. Both Andrei and Elsa were \\"Yennorks\\", werewolves that are stuck in one form (Andrei always appeared to be a wolf, and Elsa a human). Angua and Wolfgang are the only children in their family with shape-shifting ability, known as \\"bi-morphs\\". Wolfgang is extremely violent and enjoys killing, even eating, \\"inferior\\" humans. Angua, partially in reaction to what Wolfgang did to their sister, rebels against the traditional werewolf lifestyle of her parents and brother and leaves √úberwald. Andrei manages to slip away as well and enjoys a career as a talented sheep herder. After moving to Ankh-Morpork, Angua soon became the first woman to join the ranks of the City Watch. She met Corporal Carrot Ironfoundersson in the Watch, and the two soon fell in love. Since recovering from his initial surprise (which involved drawing his sword), Carrot has not seemed bothered by the fact that Angua is a werewolf. However, Angua often worries that their different backgrounds and needs will eventually doom the relationship. One of Angua's closest friends in the Watch is Cheery Littlebottom the dwarf. In Feet of Clay, Angua helps encourage Cheery to \\"come out\\" as a woman (dwarf society expects both male and female dwarves to behave in an indistinguishable way), even lending her dresses and make-up. At the same time, Angua conceals her true nature as a werewolf from Cheery because she knows her new friend hates and fears werewolves. Throughout the book Angua debates with herself over whether it would be best to just return to √úberwald and live among other werewolves. In the end, she decides to stay in Ankh- Morpork. Angua has also made friends with Gaspode, a matty, hairy canine who gained and lost the talent of human speech in Moving Pictures. He then regains it by the time of Men at Arms by sleeping too near the Unseen University's High-Energy Magic building. Gaspode flirts with Angua constantly and has helped her out on missions many times. In The Fifth Elephant, Watch Commander Sam Vimes is sent to √úberwald on a diplomatic mission. Lord Vetinari chooses Angua to be a member of the Watch team that will accompany him, but Angua has already left for √úberwald on business of her own. Carrot, assisted by Gaspode the dog, sets out after her. This is the first Discworld book to reveal much about Angua's background, and her parents and brother Wolfgang all figure in the story. Angua's relationship with actual wolves also provides much tension. Wolfgang plays a significant role as the leader of a violent werewolf movement in √úberwald. Ultimately, Vimes kills Wolfgang in a violent confrontation in the city square. Angua is gratified to hear this, as Wolfgang threatened her and anything she cared for while he remained alive. The fact that the Watch now has a werewolf has become common knowledge throughout Ankh-Morpork, but that hasn't affected Angua's privacy substantially, as, for obvious reasons, it is generally assumed to be Nobby Nobbs; Carrot, Vimes, Vetinari and Angua herself all play along, mostly rather amused. However, in The Truth, it is revealed in passing that several members of the Ankh-Morpork aristocracy, as well as the lawyer Mr Slant, are well aware of her nature, and in Making Money, Moist von Lipwig also figures this out upon seeing Angua in her werewolf form with Nobby standing beside her and recognizing her hair. Though the widespread recognition of the werewolf presence in the Watch has not inconvenienced Angua on a human level, it has led to a growing sophistication within the city's criminal underworld in evading capture. The first recorded use of a scent bomb is by The New Firm (Mr. Pin and Mr. Tulip) in The Truth. Several references to scent bombs have been made since, most notably their usage by Carcer, at the beginning of Night Watch, when he killed Sergeant Stronginthearm. Angua assists Vimes in another diplomatic mission in Monstrous Regiment, and is mentioned in Going Postal as being difficult for criminals in Ankh-Morpork to avoid. Angua also appears in a supporting role in Thud!, where she gains a rival in the form of the Watch's first vampire officer, Sally. Angua is an extremely practical and level-headed person. While not as cynical as Commander Sam Vimes, she balances out Carrot's na√Øvet√© (although she occasionally wonders if he's really as innocent as he appears). In human form, Angua is a strict vegetarian. In wolf form, she has a tendency to go after chickens, but she is always careful to go back and slip some money under the door the next day. Though she is deeply committed to Carrot, even likening herself to being his dog (or as she puts it in Jingo, a wolf that lives with humans) it hasn't stopped others with romantic interest; there is tension with a wolf named Gavin in The Fifth Elephant, and she receives a marriage proposal from the small mutt Mr. Fusspot in Making Money. In the events of I Shall Wear Midnight it is noted that Angua has been newly promoted to Captain. Captain Carrot arrests Tiffany Aching after a disturbance in the King's Head involving the Nac Mac Feegles, who are defeated by Wee Mad Arthur, another Feegle (the rat catcher from Feet of Clay who rescues Sgt Colon from the King Golem, although he was referred to as a gnome in the original novel). Wee Mad Arthur has now joined the watch, and he tells Tiffany that she shall be escorted by his colleague, Captain Angua. Subsequent (\\"main\\" as opposed to young-adult) novels also refer to her by this rank. In the 2010 Sky television adaptation of Going Postal, Angua was played by Ingrid Bols√∏ Berdal. The Cretaceous gymnosperm species Czekanowskia anguae is named after Angua.Watson, J., Lydon, S. J. and Harrison, N. A. (2001).\\"A revision of the English Wealden Flora, III: Czekanowskiales, Ginkgoales & allied Coniferales\\". Bulletin of the Natural History Museum (Geology Series), 57(1), 29-82. =Sergeant Fred Colon= Frederick \\"Fred\\" Colon is a sergeant, and appears to have been so for a long time. May have been first mentioned in The Colour of Magic as \\"a Sergeant of The Watch\\" who enters the then Broken Drum. He is described on several occasions as \\"one of nature's sergeants\\". He is overweight, preferring to avoid trouble and exertion, and rather unimaginative. When not on desk duty (a post he gets more often than other sergeants, due to being responsible for working out the rota), he generally \\"guards\\" bridges or large buildings against theft. He was a corporal in the Watch at the time Sam Vimes first joined, and subsequent to this spent some time in the army (the Duke of Quirm's Middleweight Infantry and then the Duke of Eorle's First Heavy Infantry), before returning to the Watch. In The Fifth Elephant, Colon became the head of the Traffic Squad, which also included his best friend Nobby Nobbs. This role perfectly fit the above described qualities, especially as the Traffic Squad is \\"self-financing\\" (i.e. they keep the fines). A brief promotion to acting-captain proved a disaster as everyone, including Colon himself, expected. He is currently holding dual position of Custody Officer and Watch Liaison Officer; jobs so vague that no one is entirely sure what they entail, least of all Colon himself; they serve the dual purpose of preventing his brain from becoming overburdened with responsibility and avoiding the catastrophic possibility that he might be given a task of any real importance. His office, in a separate building from the main watch house, is frequented by old acquaintances who want somewhere quiet to get away from the wife, hear what's happening on the street and‚Äîin Vimes' words‚Äî\\"gossip like washerwomen.\\" For this free-flowing source of information, Vimes considers the cost of doughnuts on an expense voucher a very favourable trade. Closer examination, though, shows that Colon has some hidden depths. As Vimes thought it, most of the other watch officers saw a fat, stupid, lazy, cowardly man and that was mostly what was there, but Colon and Nobby have a street-level knowledge of Ankh-Morpork on a par with Vimes and are good at sensing tension in a crowd. Both are also survivors of the Glorious 25 May when, as described in Night Watch, in the aftermath of a coup an assortment of regular police and hangers-on (including an apprentice Assassin called Vetinari) took out, at some cost, the hard-line remnants of the outgoing regime's secret police. Colon also performs his duties in Thud! fairly well. He is an amiable jailer, and bright enough to keep the keys in a closed tin box in the bottom drawer of his desk, well out of reach of anything an inmate would be able to use. He is often portrayed as being prejudiced against \\"minority,\\" even in the Watch, such as dwarves, undead, \\"foreigners,\\" or even women. However, his prejudice is so non-specific and naive (and frequently short-lived when actually exposed to the group in question) that nobody takes it seriously. He is possibly related to Sergeant Doppelpunkt (German for \\"colon\\", as in the punctuation mark), one half of the town watch in Bad Blintz, √úberwald, seen in The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents. Other Discworld characters with a notable similarity to Colon include a member of the guard in the √úberwald town of Bonk (who was nicknamed \\"Colonesque\\" by Samuel Vimes) and one of the market guards in Al Khali, Klatch. Like the various Dibblers, this may be due to morphic resonance. Colon is married, though his wife works during the day; since he works at night, the two seldom see each other and instead communicate by leaving notes. Vimes even goes as far as to privately attribute the longevity of Fred's marriage to this fact. In Guards! Guards! it is noted they have a number of children, a fact which Vimes puts down to 'persuasive handwriting'. Colon made a brief appearance in the Cosgrove Hall adaptation of Soul Music. In the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Guards! Guards! he was voiced by Stephen Thorne. In the 1988 stage play he was played by Roger Bingham. In the Radio 4 adaptation of Night Watch he was voiced by Sam Dale. =Corporal Nobby Nobbs= Cecil Wormsborough St. John \\"Nobby\\" Nobbs is untidy, smelly, and about the same height as a dwarf. Because of this and the fact that he is extremely ugly, he carries a certificate signed by the Patrician to prove that, on the testimony of his parents and the midwife who delivered him, he is, on the balance of probabilities, a human being. A running joke is the inability of others to believe this, despite--or even because of--the evidence. In fact, in Hogfather, even Death himself was unable to discern Nobby's species. According to the blurb of Men At Arms, Nobby was \\"disqualified from the human race for shoving\\". He always seems to have a cigarette butt about him, normally stowed behind his ear. Samuel Vimes is Nobby's commanding officer, and Sergeant Fred Colon his partner and longtime friend. Together, Nobby and Colon have managed to have many strangely philosophical (or just strange) conversations, including one on whether Death has a first name, or even any friends to call him it. Oddly enough, these conversations hint at Nobby being more intelligent than Colon, with Nobby continually pointing out fatal flaws in Colon's statements and arguments, and Colon mentally scrambling to come up with an answer (this is not unlike some of the byplay in the Laurel and Hardy films). Nobby is fond of folk dancing. As a child he was a street urchin and a major source of information for various city notables. His father was abusive, and broke his leg at least once (Vimes notes in Night Watch that Nobby used to have his arms broken by his father too‚Äîand in Hogfather, Nobby claims that he never got anything in his stocking ... except once, when his father vomited into it). The young Nobby sometimes refers to his father as \\"Number One Suspect\\", and is afraid of going to prison because his father is currently in there. He was apparently inspired to join the Watch after meeting with Sergeant-At-Arms John Keel (or alternatively Sam Vimes, due to time travel), who once gave him a spoon (which his father subsequently stole upon being released from prison). Nobby was once thought to be the Earl of Ankh, but it was all a charade to make him king as he would be easier to manipulate than the 'real' heir in the form of Captain Carrot. Nobby proved less tractable than the conspirators had expected, turning down a cushy life as figurehead ruler of Ankh-Morpork largely, by his own account, for fear of what Vimes would have to say--or more importantly, do --when he found out given his and his infamous ancestor's opinions on royalty. It was also due to his family's long-standing belief that they should never volunteer for anything as there is always going to be a catch. Indeed, he fled the offer at a dead run, all the time terrified Vimes would \\"go spare\\". However, at the end of the book Feet of Clay, it is also suggested that he may be a real nobleman, due to the amount of family heirlooms he has not mentioned to any other person. On the other hand, the Nobbses have stolen so much stuff over the years that, as Vimes has said, \\"you could probably prove Nobby was the Dowager Duchess of Quirm\\". Nobby played a role in the resolution of the \\"war\\" between Ankh-Morpork and the empire of Klatch in Jingo, and in recognition the Patrician gave him a new job in traffic control. He has since been \\"promoted\\" to assistant to the Watch Liaison Officer (in other words Fred Colon), a job vague enough to ensure he never has to do anything actually important. Ironically it is also Nobby who ends the war between the dwarves and the trolls. In Thud it is revealed that the Battle of Koom Valley, the main reason for the continuing hatred between those two races, was not supposed to be a war at all but a chance for the Kings of each side to discuss peace. This information is contained in an ancient artifact called a Cube. Nobby, who has been set up as a petty thief from the start, finds and steals the Cube at some point in the book, although we do not find this out until Vimes tells him to hand it over. Vimes works out how to make the Cube play its message, in the presence of the current King of the Dwarves, and the truth of Koom Valley is heard for the first time in hundreds of years. He believes he is in a romantic relationship with Verity \\"Hammerhead\\" Pushpram, a girl who runs a fish stall and gets her nickname from the fact that her eyes appear to be looking in opposite directions. However, this \\"relationship\\" seems to consist solely of her hitting him with a fish and telling him to bugger off. He remains \\"faithful\\" to her, however, in all books except Thud!, in which he is temporarily in a relationship with exotic dancer Tawneee. As of the events of Snuff, he appears to be in a romantic relationship with Shine of the Rainbow, a goblin girl, and it is tacitly suggested that Nobby may have some Goblin in his ancestry, explaining why nobody could be sure of his humanity. This relationship is confirmed in \\"Raising Steam\\", when Colon refers to Nobby being \\"practically married\\", in reference to his own marital arguments with Mrs Colon. He is possibly related to Corporal Knopf (as Knopf can be translated as knob), one half of the town watch in Bad Blintz, √úberwald, seen in The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents. Other Discworld characters with a notable similarity to Nobby include a member of the guard in the √úberwald town of Bonk, who was nicknamed \\"Nobbski\\" by Vimes, and one of the market guards in Al Khali, Klatch. Like the various Dibblers, this may be due to morphic resonance. Despite this, being related to Nobby is not seen as a good thing in Ankh Morpork. One of the Unseen University bedlows who, by sheer coincidence, shared the same last name as Nobby was incredibly swift to denounce any potential ties of family. According to the Pratchett Portfolio, his typical saying is \\"'tis a lie sir, I never done it\\" (like all other \\"typical sayings\\" in the Portfolio (except that of the Death of Rats) he has not actually been recorded saying it). During Nobby's time in Klatch he \\"got in touch with his feminine side\\", and is quite fond of wearing women's clothing. This can occasionally be useful, as he dressed up as an old lady as part of a Traffic scam before being stopped by Vimes. Nobby made a brief appearance in the Cosgrove Hall adaptation of Soul Music. In the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Guards! Guards! he was voiced by Melvyn Hayes. In the 1988 stageplay he was played by David Brett, formerly of the Flying Pickets. Nobby has also appeared in two computer adventure games, Discworld (The Trouble With Dragons) (where he was voiced by Tony Robinson) and Discworld Noir (where he was voiced by Rob Brydon). In both cases Nobby had a distinct Irish accent. In the 2006 TV adaptation of Hogfather he was played by Nicolas Tennant. =Sergeant Detritus= See Trolls (Discworld) =Sergeant Cheery Littlebottom= See Dwarfs (Discworld) =Constable Reginald Shoe= See: Undead (Discworld) =Lance-Constable Salacia \\"Sally\\" von Humpeding= See Undead (Discworld) =Constable Dorfl= See: Golems (Discworld) =Constable Visit-the-Infidel/Ungodly-with-Explanatory-Pamphlets= Visit-the-Infidel- with-Explanatory-Pamphlets (sometimes referred to as Visit-the-Ungodly-with- Explanatory-Pamphlets) is a Constable of the City Watch. He is generally just called \\"Constable Visit\\", or occasionally by his nickname \\"Washpot\\". The term comes from one of Visit's favourite quotations, \\"Moab is my washpot. Over Edom will I cast out my shoe\\", from Psalm 60 in The Book of Om. His name is, apparently, shorter in Omnian. He first appeared in Feet of Clay. He is referred to by Pratchett as follows: \\"There's one in every station, and Constable Visit was enough for two.\\" Samuel Vimes says he is a good copper, his highest form of personal praise. He is an Omnian of a gentle but determined proselytising nature. He can clear a large crowd in seconds, just by talking to them about religion and threatening them with pamphlets, principally Unadorned Facts and Battle Call (parodies of The Plain Truth and The War Cry). In off-duty moments he goes door to door with his fellow Omnian, Smite-the-Unbeliever-with-Cunning-Arguments. Entire pubs have been known to draw the curtains, turn off the lights and lie on the floor whimpering at news of his coming down the street. The only \\"entity\\" not afraid of Visit's endless proselytising is his friend and fellow constable Dorfl, a golem with endless patience and a desire to argue faith rationally. He appears in the SkyOne television adaptation of Hogfather, portrayed by Richard Katz. =Inspector A E Pessimal= A E Pessimal was first the government Inspector of the Watch assigned (in Thud!) by Lord Vetinari to inspect the Watch and judge whether the Watch gave fair value for the civic funds it used (\\"who watches the watchmen?\\") and to inspect the Unseen University in A Collegiate Casting-Out of Devilish Devices. He is described as a neat little man, with very shiny shoes, and has no friends and no sense of humour. He does not have a first name, as others would understand; he was \\"initialled\\" at birth rather than named.Using a single letter (not really an \\"initial\\" since it's the only letter, not the first) as a name is not actually rare. Famous people with single-letter names include the former WBC Light Heavyweight World Champion boxer J. B. Williamson, and the late US President Harry S Truman. He was in a position to seriously inconvenience Vimes with difficult questions such as; \\"Why is C.W.St.J. 'Nobby' Nobbs in the Watch? Are you aware you employ a petty criminal?\\" Eventually, Vimes decided to shake the man up, and swore him in as a special constable for the duration of an impending street fight of roughly a thousand trolls and dwarves. Vimes thought he could scare the man while showing him what it was like to be a copper. Instead, A E took his position seriously, to the point of bare-handedly attacking and trying to bite a troll who took a swing at Vimes. This action remains one of the few events to have totally shocked Vetinari, when he heard about it in Vimes' report (\\"Mr Pessimal? Mr. A E Pessimal? We are talking about the same person? Small man, very clean shoes?\\"). A short while later, A E came to Vimes' office and was offered the position of Lance-Constable and adjutant, with an estimate that he could be a Sergeant in a year. Vimes' reason for taking A E on was A E's patience and intelligence; Vimes needed someone who could look through paperwork and understand what was being said by sifting out important or suspicious facts. Vimes reasons that A E always wanted to be a Watchman and was stopped by his weak stature. As a condition of his employment, A E was told that he would go on patrol twice a week, so he would be able to learn what's important. A E is also one of the few people Vimes allows to call him \\"Mister Vimes\\", saying that the man \\"earned it all in one go\\". Along with Vimes' Dis-Organizer Mark Five (\\"The Gooseberry\\"), it would seem that A E is the start to a new department in the City Watch. By the events of Snuff, A E has risen to the newly minted rank of Inspector in the City Watch, and his forensic accounting has become legendary and feared throughout Ankh-Morpork, as people fear what he may uncover in their financial records. =Constable Igor= Igor is an Igor who was considered \\"too modern\\" for √úberwald by his family, and went with Samuel Vimes to Ankh-Morpork. He specialises in genetic experiments (\\"bio-artificing\\"), which, on the Discworld, involves really small stitches. His creations include a pet rabbit called Eerie, a particularly suitable name as he grows spare human ears on it (a reference to the human ear equipped mouse of 1995, a few years prior to the creation of the book). Another early experiment was breeding noses, which act as independent lifeforms until sewn on. He also experimented with swimming potatoes in the hopes of breeding instant Fish & Chips. As with all Igors, Constable Igor is highly talented at performing transplant surgery. He has a speech \\"impediment\\" in that he sometimes forgets to lisp. Vimes employs him because of his surgery methods, which Vimes considered to be considerably more advanced than most of Ankh-Morpork's doctors. Igor first appeared in the novel The Fifth Elephant. =Constable Downspout= Constable Downspout, who first appears in Feet of Clay, is a surveillance expert for the Watch. Being a gargoyle, he is capable of remaining motionless in one spot and watching for days at a time, a \\"world champion at not moving\\" as Vimes once put it. He has no use for money and instead receives his salary in pigeons, which he eats. =Corporal Buggy Swires= A gnome. Introduced in Jingo (possibly in The Light Fantastic; there was a gnome identified only as Swires), Buggy possesses the hard-nosed, bellicose personality typical of his species, proving able to shout down uncooperative witnesses despite being only six inches tall. He has since established himself as the sole member of the Watch's Airborne Section through his ability to tame various species of bird (most recently a buzzard, acquired from the pictsies for a crate of whisky) to act as transport, for reconnaissance and messaging purposes. =Minor Watchmen= Special- Constable Andy \\"Two Swords\\" Hancock Mentioned only in Thud!, Andy Hancock is one of the \\"Specials\\", a group of militia men trained by Sergeant Colon. He is described as being an \\"amiable man with an amiable smile\\". He fights with two curved Agatean swords and nunchaku, which he calls \\"Agatean numknuts\\" (a reference to \\"numchuks\\" a common term for the nunchaku in the United States, and a common accident occurring with their untrained use, as well as to the slang insult \\"numbnuts\\" meaning \\"idiot\\"). He is probably either an extremely competent fighter, or just a wild ninja wannabe. It is stated that he destroyed three practice dummies in thirty minutes. When not practicing, Hancock works for the \\"Grand Trunk\\" clacks company, supplying the Watch with information. Sergeant Stronginthearm Dwarf desk sergeant, appearing in The Fifth Elephant and killed just prior to the beginning of Night Watch by the serial killer known as Carcer Dun. Acting-Constable Cuddy Introduced in Men at Arms. The first dwarf recruit who put aside his differences with trolls and became a good friend to Detritus. Killed by Dr. Cruces towards the end of the story. There are overt hints that Carrot may have buried the \\"gonne\\" of the story, as well as the book containing the royal lineage, in Cuddy's coffin to keep it safe (and to give Cuddy a good weapon for the afterlife). He also created the special cooling helmet for Detritus. Constables Flint and Morraine Two troll watchmen. Introduced in Men at Arms but only have very minor roles. They were the first two non-watchmen \\"sworn in\\" (conscripted) into the Carrot's \\"Citizen's Militia\\" by Detritus, using a special troll oath (\\"I will do what I told, otherwise I get my goohuloog head kicked in.\\"). It is unclear however if these two trolls bear any resemblance to the two trolls, Flint and Morry, in Moving Pictures. Flint was briefly elevated to sergeant under the tenure of Acting-Captain Fred Colon (promoted to run the watch during the temporary resignations of Carrot and Angua while Vimes, Littlebottom and Detritus were serving as ambassadors to Uberwald in The Fifth Elephant), much to the annoyance of Nobby Nobbs, who had been obviously gunning for the promotion himself. Lance-Constable Bluejohn The Watch's largest Troll officer, Bluejohn is a gentle and retiring troll. He is so big that he is used as the riot shield for the rest of the Watch officers and he is often used during crowd control. This is because, wherever he is sent, he is the crowd. His name is taken from a type of fluorite found in Derbyshire, England. Corporal Ping Introduced in The Fifth Elephant, he has a knack for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. In the midst of a murder investigation, he takes a moment to inform Commander Sir Samuel Vimes that \\"ping\\" is a dialect word, meaning watermeadow. He also appears in Night Watch. Andre A plain-clothes watchman of the reformed Cable Street Particulars, working in the Ankh-Morpork Opera House during Maskerade. Has not been seen or mentioned since, except indirectly in Feet of Clay, when Carrot writes to his parents that there are now \\"secret policemen\\". Constable Wee Mad Arthur Sworn in by Fred Colon during the events of Feet of Clay. He was made a special Watchman for that night. His species is never explicitly stated before the novel, I Shall Wear Midnight, though Detritus refers to him as a \\"ger-nome\\". During a fight in the King's Head, in I Shall Wear Midnight, he fights off about thirty members of the Feegle clan from the Chalk, before returning to the Chalk to discover that he is, in fact, a Feegle foundling who was raised by gnomes, much in the same way Carrot was raised by dwarves. He is noted to, like Buggy Swires and other Nac Mac Feegle, have human strength in a six-inch body. After returning from leave in the Chalk, he was instrumental in uncovering the enslavement of Goblins, exercising the use of his newly learned \\"Crawstep\\" technique from his time with the Chalk Nac Mac Feegle clan. The Librarian The librarian of the Unseen University is a sentient Orangutan (formerly a human, before being magically transformed, who now communicates using only the word \\"Ook!\\") who is one of the Discworld's most frequently recurring characters. Given a badge during the events of Guards! Guards!, he refuses to give the badge back. As a \\"special constable\\", he continues to help out the Watch from time to time, such as giving Vimes the book of General Tacticus in Jingo and helping keep a barricade between rioting dwarfs and trolls in Thud! Sergeant \\"Kipper\\" Haddock Haddock first appeared in Thud! assisting Corporal Nobbs in stopping a fight between a dwarf watchman and a troll watchman. The only description of him in this appearance was that he was \\"definitely human\\", as opposed to the \\"probably human\\" Nobbs. He is known by the nickname \\"Kipper\\" by his fellow Watchmen, and Sam Vimes is comfortable enough with him to openly use the name. He later accompanied Commander Vimes on his trip to the dwarves' mine, but was sent away before reaching it with a message for Lady Sybil. During his off-nights, he works security shifts at the Royal Bank of Ankh- Morpork, where he appeared in Making Money apprehending whom he thought to be a would-be robber (actually Moist von Lipwig) in the vault. His next appearance was in Unseen Academicals, where he found two of the main characters, Trevor Likely and Mr. Nutt, in need of assistance after a football riot spilled over into a gang fight. In Snuff, Haddock is part of a diplomatic exchange programme with the City State of Quirm; Here, he is serving with the city watch at the rank of Acting-Captain; it is unclear if this is a reflection of Haddock's abilities per se, the esteem in which the Ankh-Morpork City Watch \\"Sammies\\" are held, or simply a function of the exchange programme itself. During these events, Commander Vimes promises his awaited promotion to Sergeant if he can complete a vital task (finding bacon sandwiches at short notice, with the right kind of sauce). Haddock does so, and Vimes signs his promotion on the spot. After this point, Kipper Haddock's location and current duties are unknown. Lewton Lewton appears in the third Discworld computer game, Discworld Noir. Lewton is the Disc's first and only private investigator and a former member of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, having been banished from it for taking a bribe. Lewton was once a member of the Ankh- Morpork City Watch (sometime before the books). Commander Sam Vimes had a particular unexplained grudge against him. Lewton met and fell in love with a female archaeologist named Ilsa and seemed to have a happy life; a particular moment fondly remembered was the Hotel Pseudopolis. Life seemed to be going well for Lewton. However, one day, Ilsa left Ankh-Morpork for unexplained reasons and this drew Lewton into a depression. He spent countless days drinking and drinking. During these hard times, Lewton took a bribe which ended in him being permanently excluded from the Watch. A few years later, Lewton decided to pick himself up, forget about Ilsa and the rest of his past and start a new life. He became a Private Investigator. However, he rarely got any cases. When Carlotta Von Uberwald came into his life, Lewton's life changed forever. She gave him the Mundy Case and although Lewton didn't know it, she used him as a puppet in order to find Mundy (of whom she said was her lover but he was really an informant for her cult). After discovering this they argued, and during this argument Carlotta kissed and bit Lewton, turning him into a werewolf (or some variant type, several of which are named or referenced in the books themselves). Using his new wolf abilities, Lewton managed to put a stop to Carlotta's cult's plans and save Ankh-Morpork from being consumed by a giant \\"god of destruction\\". While he was working on the Mundy Case, Ilsa came back to his life and it looked like they were going get back together, but much like with Casablanca's ending, at the end of the game Lewton watches her fly away in the Disc's first airplane. =Former Members= Findthee Swing Captain Swing is the head of the Unmentionables in the Ankh-Morpork of the past in Night Watch. Swing is mainly remembered for his attempt to control crime by ordering all weapons confiscated, reasoning that this would result in a decline in crime figures, failing to acknowledge that criminals don't obey the law in the first place and would actually greatly enjoy the lack of weapons in society. He is described as a thin, balding man dressed in a long, old-fashioned black coat with large pockets, and supports himself on an opera cane (which is in reality a swordstick). Swing moves and speaks in an erratic, jumpy fashion, in bursts, and sputters rather than a continuous flow of movement or sound. He is, however, a skilled swordsman, as he does not resort to flashy swashbuckling, but instead actually attacks his opponent. Swing always carries with him a large set of calipers and a steel ruler, with which he measures the facial characteristics of people he meets in order to determine their personal traits (phrenology). Its reliability is questionable; according to it, Vimes has the eye of a mass murderer (Vimes says he indeed does ... in his other suit), while Carcer's only problem was his environment (most likely all the dead bodies wherever he went). He is killed by Vimes during the fire at the Unmentionables' headquarters. On arriving at the Great Desert he tries to use his phrenological skills to determine Death's character, only to find that Death has no characteristics he can measure. The name Captain Swing has long been associated with civil unrest, being the pseudonym of the (possibly mythical) leader of the Swing Riots.  Mayonnaise Quirke and The Day Watch  Before the merging of the Watches, the Day Watch dealt with all crimes committed during daylight. The only significant Day Watch member mentioned is its captain, \\"Mayonnaise\\" Quirke, who first appears in Men at Arms. Quirke is nicknamed \\"Mayonnaise\\" by the Night Watch as he is rich, thick, oily, and smells faintly of eggs. In Night Watch he is revealed to be a little bit older than Vimes. He was originally a Corporal in the Night Watch before kicked out by Sergeant-at-Arms John Keel (actually Vimes). He joined the Day Watch shortly afterwards and presumably rose to the rank of captain at the same time as Vimes did. During the events of Men at Arms, he is knocked out by Carrot, who tells his men to leave the city; presumably, Quirke left with them.  Sergeant John Keel  A veteran watch member from another city, Keel served as a mentor to the recently hired Sam Vimes fo a short period before dying in the Glorious Revolution of Night Watch. When Vimes is sent back in time in that book, he discovers that Keel has been murdered immediately after arriving in the city, forcing the older Vimes to assume his role to preserve history, and impart positive moral lessons upon his younger self.  Lance-Corporal Ned Coates  A former subordinate of the original Keel from Pseudopolis, who became suspicious ofVimes when he was forced to assume the identity. Keel was a leader of the revolutionary forces. He was among those killed in the revolution.  Constable Billy Wiglet  A diminutive former fruit porter until he began suffering from a bad back and lung problems as a result of lifting heavy boxes on cold mornings. Wiglet joined the watch two years before Night Watch. Billy was a friend of young Constable Vimes and Sergeant Keel. He was among those persuaded to join the revolution at Treacle Mine Road, albeit with some concerns about how it invoked going against lawful, if not righteous, city authorities. His brother was among the first of the citizens to join the barricade. Billy was shot in the chest with an arrow and killed at the conclusion of the conflict.  Herbert \\"Leggy\\" Gaskin  A survivor of the Glorious Revolution briefly seen in Night Watch, Gaskin died in the line of duty shortly before Carrot arrives in the city at the beginning of Guards, Guards. Men at Arms reveals he left behind a widow who is supported by Vimes.  Captain Tilden  The former captain of the Treacle Mine Street Watch House who was seventy years old at the time of the \\"past\\" parts of Night Watch. Tilden joined the Watch after retiring from the cavalry, after saving for several decades and losing a leg and an ear. An honorable man and benevolent watch commander (albeit one temperamentally unsuited for the job), Tilden was conflicted between his duty and his distaste for the methods of Lord Winder. Tilden was eventually relieved of his command, and exited the watch house prior to most of his men declaring for the rebels.  Cecil \\"Snouty\\" Clapman  The jailer of the Treacle Mine Street Watch House. He suffers from watery eyes and a broken nose that was not re-set properly. Clapman is known for being stern and dim but fair to his charges. Snouty loyally supported Tilden and was shaken by his removal. He was among those killed by Carcer Dun at the order of Lord Snapcase.  Sergeant Dai Dickins  Sergeant of the Dimwell Watch House. During the Glorious Revolution he deserted rather than shoot unarmed civilians, joining the Treacle Mine Street barricade. A veteran of the city's last revolution, he joined John Keel in organizing the forces there. He was killed by Carcer Dun and his men.  Constable Waddy  A Watchman at the Treacle Mine Road watch house who served with Vimes, Keel and others during the Glorious Revolution. He was well known by the various locals, particularly ones who frequented drinking establishments. Waddy remained with Keel during the Glorious Revolution, helping to barricade the street. He survived the Revolution, but is never mentioned elsewhere in the series, having either retired or died by the events of Guards, Guards.  Sergeant Knock  Fred Colon's predecessor as sergeant, a bullying man who sided with Lord Winder during the revolution and attempted to kill his former colleagues.  Horace Nancyball  A lanky young watchman who joined up not long before Vimes. Nancyball was an orphan raised by his grandmother. He had a reputation for wetting his pants when threatened with violence. Upon entering Captain Swing's torture chamber to free the captives he is mentioned as vomiting and alter fainting. He remained at the station during the revolution was the first watchman to die at the Barricade.  Corporal Curry  Briefly mentioned among the watchmen who support the revolution in Night Watch, Curry has died in the line of duty at some point afterwards. He was apparently a single parent, as during the events of Men at Arms, his daughter Annabel, age 9, lives in a charity home, paid for by Vimes.  \\"Iffy\\" Scurrick  Briefly mentioned in Night Watch as a friend of a young Samuel Vimes who joined the Watch for the room and board, and encouraged his friend to do the same. He does not appear during the events of the novel, being stationed at a different Watch House. By the time of Men at Arms he is mentioned as having died in the line of duty, with Vimes helping to support his widow. Allies =71-Hour Ahmed= A Klatchian warrior who accompanies the Klatchian envoy Prince Khufurah on a diplomatic journey to Ankh-Morpork in the novel Jingo. He speaks with a heavy accent and has a penchant for chewing on cloves. Following an attempt on the prince's life by an unknown assassin, he is suspected of killing the Watch's prime suspect, provoking Vimes and other Watch members to pursue him back to Klatch (Particularly after he captures Angua in werewolf form). Apart from belonging to a vicious but honorable warrior clan known as the D'regs, he is later revealed to be the Wali of Klatch, a Klatchian equivalent of a watchman on a par with Vimes (Wali is both a play on the British term \\"Wally\\", meaning a simpleton or halfwit and an Arabic word equivalent to \\"magistrate\\"). It also turns out his obsessive clove-chewing and broken Morporkian are in fact a disguise meant to delude foreigners into falsely assuming he is nothing but an uncivilized barbarian. Like many privileged foreigners, he was sent to the Assassins' Guild as a child on the assumption that he would get an excellent education. He confounds Vimes by his fond memories of Ankh-Morpork, and even Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler. He and Vimes eventually develop a wary respect for each other, mostly based on both of them being basically honest cops in unenviable positions. He got his nickname after killing a man (guilty of poisoning a well, and killing a number of villagers and very valuable camels) one hour before the end of the traditional D'reg three days of hospitality, during which even your greatest enemy should be shown respect. =Willikins= Butler to Commander Vimes and Lady Sibyl, Willikins was in his youth a member of the Shamlegger Street Rude Boys street gang (whose skills at street violence were respected even by Sam Vimes) where his weapon of choice was a cap brim sewn with sharpened pennies. In Night Watch it is revealed that he has been in the service of the Ramkin family for most of his life. His only absence from this employment was during the events in Jingo when he joined the army during the war against Klatch, during which he was known to alternate between violently yelling at his men for showing disrespect and then politely apologising to Vimes for their actions. It is implied, and almost certainly true, that he bit a man's nose off during the same war. At some point in his life (almost certainly prior to entering service with the Ramkins), Willikins spent some time in the Tanty (prison), as he explains in Snuff. Willikins' exaggerated deference and circumlocutory manner of speech strongly echo the character Jeeves created by P G Wodehouse. He has proven himself more than once to be a skilled and ruthless fighter as well as a dutiful butler‚Äîsometimes simultaneously: during the events of Thud!, Willikins is surprised by a Deep-Down Dwarf carrying a flamethrower entering the house illegally, and is \\"forced to defend (himself) with the first thing that came to hand\\", the 18-inch long sharp serrated-steel ice knife; he also lodged another dwarf on a meathook. It is also revealed in Thud! that Willikins is a member of the \\"Specials\\"‚ÄîThe Ankh-Morpork City Militia. However, during the events of Snuff, Willikins goes to great lengths to avoid being involved with the local version of the Watch, claiming it went against his personal grain to be associated with the forces of Law and Order. =John \\"Mossy\\" Lawn= A doctor in Ankh-Morpork. He first appeared in Night Watch, as a backstreet \\"pox doctor\\", offering medical assistance to \\"seamstresses\\". He had trained in Klatch, where he had learnt techniques other Morporkian surgeons distrusted, but which kept patients alive for longer than it took to pay the bill. He also gave free treatment to those who needed it, including those who had been tortured by the Cable Street Particulars. He is quiet, if a tad sarcastic, and almost unshockable. Following his successful delivery of Young Sam, Samuel Vimes gave him a large area of land in the Goosegate area of the city. In Going Postal this is the Lady Sybil Free Hospital. Dr Lawn's preferred method of dealing with the nursing staff is to throw a handful of chocolates in one direction and run in the other as fast as possible. He claims that, when he dies, he wants a bell left on his gravestone so he can have the pleasure of not getting up when people ring.

The form Eggjum would be the dative; the form used on modern official Norwegian maps is Eggja. in Sogndal, Nordre Bergenhus amt (now in Vestland county), Norway. Description Runic inscription on the Eggja stone (ca. 600-700 c.e) from Sogndal, Norway. The Eggja stone was found with the written side downwards over a man's grave (cf. the Kylver stone) which is dated to the period 650-700 C.E. The flat slab of stone is nowadays in Bergen Museum. Having as many as 200 runes, it is the longest known inscription in the Elder Futhark, but certain runes are transitional towards the Younger Futhark. Many scholarly works have been written about the inscription, but only minor parts of the partially preserved inscription have received an accepted translation. It is generally agreed that it is written in stylized poetry and in a partly metrical form containing a protection for the grave and the description of a funerary rite. However, there are widely diverging interpretations about certain details. There is also the image of a horse carved into the stone, but it does not appear to have any connection with the inscription.

No man may lay [it] bare, when the waning moon runs [across the heavens]. Misguided men may not lay [the stone] aside. \\" The stone has been prepared in accordance with tradition; the stone is untouched by sunlight, and not cut with iron. It should not be uncovered during the waning moon, and should not be removed from its place. * Panel 2:The Kieler Runenprojekt lists 9 suggested translations of panel 2. :\\"The man sprinkled this [stone] with corpse-sea (blood), with it he rubbed the tholes of the well drilled boat. As who came the army-god hither onto the land of warriors? A fish swimming out of the terrible stream, a bird screaming into the enemy band\\" Someone has stained this stone with blood (kenned as corpse-sea); perhaps as part of a sacrifice to facilitate the passage of the deceased or call on whatever power the inscription is addressed to. The her√°ss is the \\"god of armies\\" - a psychopomp god (i.e. an early form of Odin) who comes to the land of the living to take the deceased to an afterlife. * Panel 3:The Kieler Runenprojekt lists 8 suggested translations of panel 3. :\\"Protection against the wrong-doer\\" ;Gr√∏nvik (1985) Ottar Gr√∏nvik (1985) offers a more prosaic interpretation. Panel 3 above is relegated to the middle, as part B: :A1 (hiu √æwer) hin warp naseu wil Ä made √æaim kaiba i bormo√æa huni :A2 huwa Ä ob kam harie a hit lat :A3 gotna fisk Ä o Ä firnauim suwimade foki af (f)a(nwan)ga lande :B a(i a)u is urki :C1 ni s solu sot uk ni sakse stain skorin :C2 ni (witi) ma Ä nakdan is na wrin Ä ni wilti Ä man Ä lagi(s) (Parenthesis denotes reconstructed or anticipated forms) The Old Norse equivalent is here said to be: :A1 Hj√∫ √æverr, h√≠n varp n√°sj√≥ *Vill: m√°√∞e √æeim keipa i borm√≥√∞a h√∫ni. :A2 Hverr of kom her √° hitt land? :A3 Gotna fiskr √≥r firney-√≠m, svimande foki af f√°n-vanga lande. :B √Ü ey es yrki! :C1 Ne's s√≥lu s√≥tt, ok ne sakse, stein skorinn; :C2 ne v√≠ti ma√∞r, n«´k√∞an es n√° rinn, ne viltir menn, l√¶gis!

According to this interpretation, A1 is a description of a shipwreck in bad weather. The mast seems to have broken, and the oars could not save them, as a mythical creature, *Vil (possibly the sea-god Aegir, or simply divine will,) casts a wave upon the boat. Parts A2, A3 and B explains the fate of the deceased. As A2 asks how they will get to the land beyond, A3 replies that a divine creature in the shape of a fish will lead them to the land of shining meadows. Part B prays that the work of the one writing this will help. Firney is probably not a place name, but possibly Fear-island or Far-island, and a kenning for the realm of the dead. Part C1 says that the inscription was done at night, and not by using steel. This probably pertains to ancient grave- rituals, but the exact meaning is unclear. C2 issues warning directed at necromancers and mad (or mentally ill) people to prevent them from desecrating the grave. Meter Panel 2 has been suggested to contain a stanza in the Galdralag meter, i.e.: :Hu√¶a Ä of kam h√¶r√°ss √° :hi √° land gotna. :Fisk Ä √≥ Ä f(ir)na uim suim(m)ande, :fogl √° f??????? galande. :Whom as came harrier-god :here to go√∞ 's land? :Fishlike, out of river-fear swimming, :as fowl, out of f(?) crowing The inscription loosely follows the pattern of the Merseburg Incantations, divided into two complementary parts, but where the Merseburger invokes a mythic event and calls for an exorcistic repetition, the Eggja composer seems to twice invoke a ritual, the first time listing two desired outcomes, in the second instance asking a question and answering it. Both inscriptions may represent some of the few remaining examples of pre-Christian ljo√∞ or galdr, ritual verse chanted by the cult leaders, shamans or oracles of Norse Scandinavia.

It is designed to provide rigid support during movement of a person with suspected spinal or limb injuries. They are most commonly used by ambulance staff, as well as lifeguards and ski patrollers. Historically, backboards were also used in an attempt to \\"improve the posture\\" of young people, especially girls.cf Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront√´, Chapter 3. Due to lack of evidence to support long-term use, the practice of keeping people on long boards for prolonged periods of time is decreasing. Extraction uses The spinal backboard was originally designed as a device to remove people from a vehicle. After a time people were simply kept on the spine board for transport without evidence supporting this need. Medical uses A spinal board is primarily indicated for judicious use to transport people who may have had a spinal injury, usually due to the mechanism of injury, and the attending team are not able to rule out a spinal injury. The person should be transferred from the board to a hospital bed as soon as possible. For comfort and safety reasons, it is recommended to transfer the person to a vacuum mattress instead, in which case a scoop stretcher or long spine board is just used for the transfer. Despite its history of use, there is no evidence that backboards immobilize the spine, nor do they improve the person's outcomes. Additionally, cervical spine motion restriction has been shown to increase mortality in people with penetrating trauma and can cause pain, agitation, respiratory compromise, and can lead to the development of bedsores.National Association of EMS Physicians and American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma. January 15, 2013 Position Statement: EMS Spinal Precautions and the Use of the Long Backboard Adverse effects Common clinical issues found with spinal boards include pressure sore development, inadequacy of spinal motion restriction, pain and discomfort, respiratory compromise and effects on the quality of radiological imaging. For this reason, some professionals view them as unsuitable for the task, preferring alternatives. It is advised that no patient should spend more than 30 minutes on a spine board, due to the development of discomfort and pressure sores. Backboards were invented to be a \\"highly polished surface\\" to move a person to an EMS bed, not to be used as spinal securing device. Construction Head immobilizer at the top of the backboard. Backboards are almost always used in conjunction with the following devices: * a cervical collar with occipital padding as needed; * side head supports, such as a rolled blanket or head blocks (head immobilizer) made specifically for this purpose, used to avoid the lateral rotation of the head; * straps to secure the patient to the long spine board, and tape to secure the head Spine boards are typically made of wood or plastic, although there has been a strong shift away from wood boards due to their higher level of maintenance required to keep them in operable condition and to protect them from cracks and other imperfections that could harbor bacteria. Backboards are designed to be slightly wider and longer than the average human body to accommodate the immobilization straps, and have handles for carrying the patient. Most backboards are designed to be completely X-ray translucent so that they do not interfere with the exam while patients are strapped to them. They are light enough to be easily carried by one person, and are usually buoyant. Alternatives The vacuum mattress may reduce sacral pressures compared to backboards. The conforming nature of the vacuum mattress means that people can be kept immobilized on it for longer periods of time and the immobilisation offers superior stability and comfort. The Kendrick extrication device is another alternative.

It is situated northwest of Kristiansund, where seabed depths vary between . The field is named after the famous longship Ormen Lange of Olaf Tryggvason, a 10th-century Viking king of Norway. History Production of gas began with three wells in September 2007.Facts about Ormen Lange - Statoil. The King and Queen of Norway attended the official opening of this project, delivered on time and inside budget, on 6 October 2007, at the football stadium in Molde. During the opening, King Harald officially opened the terminal which would supply Great Britain with enough natural gas to cover 20% of its total annual needs. The proposal to build the Langeled subsea pipeline, the world‚Äôs second longest subsea export pipeline, was approved in February 2003. The pipeline runs across the North Sea from Nyhamna to the Easington Gas Terminal near the mouth of the River Humber on the UK‚Äôs East coast. Reserves The reservoir is approximately long and wide, and lies about below sea level. Recoverable gas reserves are estimated to be ~300 billion cubic meters. Technical description The Ormen Lange field has been developed without using conventional offshore platforms. Instead, 24 subsea wellheads in four seabed templates on the ocean floor are connected directly by two pipelines to an onshore process terminal at Nyhamna. After processing, the gas is exported by the world's second longest subsea gas pipeline - Langeled pipeline - approximately from Nyhamna to Easington in England. The northern section of the export pipeline has a diameter of , and the section from Sleipner to Easington has a diameter of . The field produces 70 million cubic meters of natural gas per day. Total cost is estimated to reach 66 billion Norwegian kroner (around US$12 billion) by the time of completion. The onshore facility at Nyhamna was designed by Aker Solutions Engineering in 2003-2007. Natural conditions Extreme natural conditions at the site (subzero temperatures part of the year, stormy seas, strong underwater currents, uneven seabed) put great demands on the technology used in the project. The Storegga Slides that occurred in the area about 8,000 years ago have been investigated, with the conclusion that the risk of recurrence is negligible. Ownership and operators Several companies share ownership of Ormen Lange. *Petoro AS: 36.4850% *Statoil: 25.3452% *Norske Shell: 17.8134% *DONG Energy: 14.0208% *ExxonMobil: 6.3356% Ormen Lange was operated by Statoil during the development stage.

Many of its remains can be visited and there are two museums on the site. History =Foundation and earliest history= Ideal reconstruction of the Temple of Victory. Himera was the first Greek settlement on this part of the island and was a strategic outpost just outside the eastern boundary of the Carthaginian- controlled west. Thucydides says it was the only Greek city on this coast of Sicily,vi. 62, vii. 58. which must however be understood with reference only to independent cities. Mylae, which was also on the north coast and certainly of Greek origin, was a dependency of Zancle (modern Messina). All authorities agree that Himera was a colony of Zancle, but Thucydides tells us that the emigrants from Zancle mingled with a number of Syracusan exiles, resulting in a city with Chalcidic institutions and a Doric dialect. The foundation of Himera is placed subsequent to that of Mylae (as, from their relative positions, might naturally have been expected) both by Strabo and Scymnus Chius: its date is not mentioned by Thucydides, but Diodorus tells us that it had existed 240 years at the time of its destruction by the Carthaginians, which would fix its first settlement in 648 BC.Thuc. vi. 5; Strab. vi. p. 272; Scymn. Ch. 289; Diod. xiii. 62; Hecat. fr. 49; Scyl. p. 4. ¬ß 13. Archaeology shows that around 580-560 BC the city was completely rebuilt after an unknown event destroyed it. There is otherwise very little information as to its early history: an obscure notice in Aristotle,Rhet. ii. 20. from which it appears to have at one time fallen under the dominion of the tyrant Phalaris, being the only mention found of it, until about 490 BC, when it afforded a temporary refuge to Scythes, tyrant of Zancle, after his expulsion from the latter city.Herod. vi. 24. Not long after this event, Himera fell itself under the yoke of a despot named Terillus, who sought to fortify his power by contracting a close alliance with Anaxilas, at that time ruler both of Rhegium (modern Reggio di Calabria) and Zancle. But Terillus was unable to resist the power of Theron, despot of Agrigentum (modern Agrigento), and, being expelled by him from Himera, had recourse to the assistance of the Carthaginians, a circumstance which became the immediate occasion of the first great expedition of that people to Sicily, 480 BC.Id. vii. 165. =First interaction with Carthage= Site of the first battle of Himera The magnitude of the armament sent under Hamilcar, who is said to have landed in Sicily with an army of 300,000 men, sufficiently proves that the conquest of Himera was the pretext, rather than the object, of the war. However, it is likely that the growing power of Himeria in the immediate vicinity of the Carthaginian settlements of Panormus and Solus had already caused concern among the Carthaginians. Hence it was against Himera that the first efforts of Hamilcar were directed. Theron, who had thrown himself into the city with all the forces at his command, was able to maintain its defence until the arrival of Gelon of Syracuse. Despite the numerical inferiority of his forces, he defeated the army of the Carthaginians with such slaughter that the Battle of Himera in 480 BC was regarded by the Greeks of Sicily as worthy of comparison with the contemporary victory of Salamis.Herod. vii. 166, 167; Diod. xi. 20-23; Pind. Pyth. i. 152. The same feeling probably gave rise to the tradition or belief, that both triumphs were achieved on the very same day.Herod. l. c. =After the Battle of Himera= This victory left Theron in the undisputed possession of the sovereignty of Himera, as well as of that of Agrigentum. He appears to have focused on Agrigentum, and left the government of Himera to his son Thrasydaeus. But the young man, by his violent and oppressive rule, soon alienated the minds of the citizens. They applied for relief to Hieron of Syracuse, at that time on terms of hostility with Theron. The Syracusan despot, however, betrayed their overtures to Theron. He took vengeance on the Himeraeans, putting to death a large number of the disaffected citizens and driving others into exile.Diod. xi. 48. Shortly after, seeing that the city had suffered greatly from these severities and that its population was much diminished, he sought to restore its prosperity by establishing there a new body of citizens whom he collected from various quarters. The greater part of these new colonists were of Dorian extraction, and though the two bodies of citizens were blended into one and continued to live harmoniously together, at this period Himera became a Doric city. Himera adopted the institutions and followed the policy of the other Doric states of Sicily.Id. xi. 49. This settlement seems to have taken place in 476 BC,There is a confusion about this date, though, because Diodorus relates the circumstances in the year of Phaedon, Ol. LXXVI. 1, which would place it in 476 BC, he adds that the new colony subsisted 58 years, until its destruction by the Carthaginians, which would refer it to the year 466 BC. This last date is clearly incompatible with the fact that Theron died in 472 BC. and Himera continued subject to Theron until his death, in 472 BC, but Thrasydaeus retained possession of the sovereignty for a very short time after the death of his father, and his defeat by Hieron of Syracuse was speedily followed by his expulsion both from Agrigentum and Himera.Id. xi. 53. In 466 BC we find the Himeraeans, in their turn, sending a force to assist the Syracusans in throwing off the yoke of Thrasybulus; and, in the general settlement of affairs which followed soon after, the exiles were allowed to return to Himera, where they appear to have settled quietly together with the new citizens.Id. xi. 68, 76. From this period Diodorus expressly tells us that Himera was fortunate enough to escape from civil dissensions,xi. 49. and this good government must have secured to it no small share of the prosperity which was enjoyed by the Sicilian cities in general during the succeeding half-century. But though we are told in general terms that the period which elapsed from this re-settlement of Himera until its destruction by the Carthaginians (461‚Äì408 BC), was one of peace and prosperity, the only notices we find of the city during this interval refer to the part it took at the time of the Athenian expedition to Sicily, 415 BC. On that occasion, the Himeraeans were among the first to promise their support to Syracuse: hence, when Nicias presented himself before their port with the Athenian fleet, they altogether refused to receive him; and, shortly after, it was at Himera that Gylippus landed, and from whence he marched across the island to Syracuse, at the head of a force composed in great part of Himeraean citizens.Thucydides vi. 62, vii. 1, 58; Diod. xiii. 4, 12. =Destruction by Carthage= 300px In 409 BC the prosperity of the city was brought to an abrupt end by the great Carthaginian expedition to Sicily. The ostensible object of the expedition was the support of the Segestans against their neighbours, the Selinuntines. The Carthaginians, though, had greater ambitions. Immediately after the destruction of Selinus, Hannibal Mago, who commanded the expedition, hastened to turn his arms against Himera. That city was ill-prepared for defence; its fortifications were of little strength, but the citizens made a desperate resistance, and by a vigorous sally inflicted severe loss on the Carthaginians. They were at first supported by a force of about 4000 auxiliaries from Syracuse under the command of Diocles, but that general became seized with a panic fear for the safety of Syracuse itself and abandoned Himera, leaving the unfortunate citizens to contend singlehanded against the Carthaginian power. Their defenses failed and the city was soon taken by storm. A large part of the citizens were killed and at least 3000 of them, who had been taken prisoners, were put to death by Hannibal as a sacrifice to the memory of his grandfather Hamilcar.Diod. xiii. 59-62; Xen. Hell. i. 1. 37. The city itself was utterly destroyed, its buildings razed to the ground, and even the temples themselves were not spared. Diodorus, who relates the total destruction of Himera, tells us expressly that it was never rebuilt, and that the site remained uninhabited down to his own times. It seems at first in contradiction with this statement, that he elsewhere includes the Himeraeans, as well as the Selinuntines and Agrigentines, among the exiled citizens that were allowed by the treaty, concluded with Carthage, in 405 BC, to return to their homes, and inhabit their own cities, on condition of paying tribute to Carthage and not restoring their fortifications.Id. xiii. 114. And it seems clear that many of them at least availed themselves of this permission, as we find the Himeraeans subsequently mentioned among the states that declared in favour of Dionysius I of Syracuse, at the commencement of his great war with Carthage in 397 BC; though they quickly returned to the Carthaginian alliance in the following year.Id. xiv. 47, 56. The explanation of this difficulty is furnished by Cicero, who tells us that, after the destruction of Himera, those citizens who had survived the calamity of the war established themselves at Thermae, within the confines of the same territory, and not far from their old town.Cicero 'In Verrem ii. 3. 5. Diodorus gives a somewhat different account of the foundation of Thermae, which he represents as established by the Carthaginians themselves before the close of the war, in 407 BC.Diod. xiii. 79. But it is probable that both statements are substantially correct, and that the Carthaginians founded the new town in the immediate neighbourhood of Himera, in order to prevent the old site being again occupied; while the Himeraean exiles, when they returned thither, though they settled in the new town, naturally regarded themselves as still the same people, and would continue to bear the name of Himeraeans. How completely, even at a much later period, the one city was regarded as the representative of the other, appears from the statement of Cicero, that when Scipio Aemilianus, after the capture of Carthage, restored to the Agrigentines and Gelenses the statues that had been carried off from their respective cities, he at the same time restored to the citizens of Thermae those that had been taken from Himera.Cicero In Verrem ii. 3. 5, iv. 33. Hence we cannot be surprised to find that, not only are the Himeraeans still spoken of as an existing people, but even that the name of Himera itself is sometimes inadvertently used as that of their city. Thus, in 314 BC, Diodorus tells us that, by the treaty between Agathocles and the Carthaginians, it was stipulated that Heracleia, Selinus and Himera should continue subject to Carthage as they had been before.Diod. xix. 71. It is much more strange that we find the name of Himera reappear both in Mela and Pliny, though we know from the distinct statements of Cicero and Strabo, as well as Diodorus, that it had ceased to exist centuries before.Strabo vi. p. 272; Mel. ii. 7. ¬ß 16; Plin. iii. 8. s. 14. =Foundation of Thermae= The new town of Thermae or Therma called for the sake of distinction Thermae Himerenses,, Pol.; , Ptol.; , , Diod. which thus took the place of Himera, obviously derived its name from the hot springs for which it was celebrated, and the first discovery of which was connected by legends with the wanderings of Hercules.Diod. iv. 23, v. 3; Pindar Ol. xii. 28. It appears to have early become a considerable town, though it continued, with few and brief exceptions, to be subject to the Carthaginian rule. In the First Punic War its name is repeatedly mentioned. Thus, in 260 BC, a body of Roman troops were encamped in the neighborhood, when they were attacked by Hamilcar, and defeated with heavy loss.Pol. i. 24; Diod. xxiii. 9. Exc. H. p. 503. Before the close of the war, Thermae itself was besieged and taken by the Romans.Pol. i. 39; Diod. xxiii. 20. Exc. H. p. 506. Cicero relates that the Roman government restored to the Thermitani their city and territory, with the free use of their own laws, as a reward for their steady fidelity.quod semper in amicitia fideque mansissent, Cicero In Verrem ii: 37. They were on hostile terms with Rome during the First Punic War, so it can only be to the subsequent period that these expressions apply; but the occasion to which they refer is unknown. In the time of Cicero, Thermae appears to have been a flourishing place, carrying on a considerable amount of trade, though the orator speaks, of it as oppidum non maximum.Id. ii. 46, 75, iii. 42. It seems to have received a colony in the time of Augustus, whence we find mention in inscriptions of the Ordo et Populus splendidissimae Coloniae Augustae Himeraeorum Thermitanorum:Castell. Inscr. Sicil. p. 47; Gruter. Inscr. p. 433, no. 6.. and there can be little doubt that the Thermae colonia of Pliny in reality refers to this town, though he evidently understood it to be Thermae Selinuntiae (modern Sciacca), as he places it on the south coast between Agrigentum and Selinus.Plin. iii. 8. s. 14. There is little subsequent account of Thermae; but, as its name is found in Ptolemy and the Itineraries, it appears to have continued in existence throughout the period of the Roman Empire, and probably never ceased to be inhabited, as the modern town of Termini Imerese retains the ancient site as well as name.Ptol. iii. 4. ¬ß 4; Antonine Itinerary p. 92; Tabula Peutingeriana. The magnificence of the ancient city, and the taste of its citizens for the encouragement of art, are attested by Cicero, who calls it in primis Siciliae clarum et ornatum; and some evidence of it remained, even in the days of that orator, in the statues preserved by the Thermitani, to whom they had been restored by Scipio, after the conquest of Carthage; and which were valuable, not only as relics of the past, but from their high merit as works of art.Cicero In Verrem ii. 3. 5. The numerous examples of coins from Himera testify to the city's wealth in antiquity. Site The exact position of Himera was a subject of controversy until recent times. Cluverius was followed by almost all writers in the 19th century and placed it on the west bank of the river San Leonardo which flows past the west side of Termini. On this supposition the inhabitants moved from one bank of the river to the other which would explain the texts in which Himera and Thermae appear to be regarded as identical, and where the river Himera is also said to be flowing past Thermae.Silius Italicus xiv. 232; Plin. iii. 8. s. 14; Vib. Sequest. p. 11. Fazello correctly identified the Himera river with the Imera Settentrionale, the mouth of which is 8 miles from Termini. This distance was not too great to be reconciled with Cicero's expression that the new settlement (Thermae) was established non longe ab oppido antique; while the addition that it was in the same territory in ejusdem agri finibus, l. c.. would seem to imply that it was not very near the old site. Archaeology Many parts of the ancient city have been excavated in recent years and can be visited. Of the lower city the main visible remains consist of the monumental Tempio della Vittoria (Temple of Victory), a Doric structure built to commemorate the defeat of the Carthaginians. The upper city on top of the hill has remains of other temples and of many other buildings. At various locations around the city were the town's necropoles and many artifacts recovered are displayed in both museums on site. There are also impressive displays in Palermo's Museo Archeologico Regionale. Rainwater spouts from the temple roof (Palermo museum) Famous people Himera is said to be the birthplace of the poet Stesichorus but in fact he was born in the Magna Graecian town of Metauros (modern Gioia Tauro)http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/565868/Stesichorus in 630BC. He moved to Himera in later life and wrote his poetry whilst a resident of the town. Ergoteles, whose victory at the Olympic games is celebrated by Pindar, was a citizen, but not a native, of Himera.Pind. Ol. xii.; Paus. vi. 4. ¬ß 11. On the other hand, Thermae had the honour of being the birthplace of the tyrant Agathocles.Diod. xix. 2.

It was released in North America in March 2006, with other territories later. It is a part of the Metroid series, and the story takes place between the events of Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. Players assume the role of series protagonist Samus Aran, a bounty hunter who investigates a mysterious message that originated from the Alimbic Cluster. The game contains more first-person shooter aspects than the previous titles in the Metroid Prime series, with removal of assisted aiming, more action-oriented gameplay, and various multiplayer modes. It was created to utilize the Nintendo DS hardware, such as Wi-Fi and voice chat capabilities, and introduced other bounty hunters with unique weapons and alternative forms. Metroid Prime Hunters was announced by Nintendo at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo. A pack-in demo version of the game, titled Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt, was included with the Nintendo DS when it launched in November 2004. Reviews were generally favorable towards the game; praise focused on its gameplay and graphics, while criticism targeted its control scheme. It also received several honors; including an \\"Editors' Choice\\" award from IGN, which also named the game the \\"Best DS Action Game\\" of 2006, while Nintendo Power gave it awards for \\"Best Graphics\\", \\"Best Shooter/Action Game\\", and \\"Best Wi-Fi Functionality\\". Over 410,000 copies of the game were sold in North America in its first month of release, and it was the fourth best-selling game during its debut month in Japan. Metroid Prime Hunters was re-released on the Wii U's Virtual Console service in Japan in 2015, and in North America and Europe the following year. Gameplay alt=Two screens appear, one above the other. Above, a weapon is pointed outwards, facing an opponent. Below, a radar is shown. Like the previous titles in the Prime series, Metroid Prime Hunters is generally classified as a first-person adventure to highlight the focus on navigation and discovery. However, the game differs from its predecessors with the removal of assisted aiming, more action-oriented gameplay, and the inclusion of an online multiplayer mode. The player controls Samus Aran, who is equipped with a Power Suit that allows her to access her gunship from anywhere. She can scan almost any object in the game; the gunship will return relevant information retrieved from its database. An Arm Cannon is attached to the Power Suit, which she uses to attack enemies. To enter small tunnels, Samus can roll into a Morph Ball, an alternative form of the Power Suit that decreases her size substantially. In this form, she is given an unlimited supply of bombs but is only allowed to use three at a time. She can use the bombs to defend herself and destroy small objects. In Metroid Prime Hunters, the Nintendo DS's top screen shows Samus's HUD as seen from her visor, which displays the amount of remaining ammunition for the currently selected weapon along with her health; in multiplayer games, the number of kills and time remaining in the round are also shown. The bottom touchscreen displays the radar. When using the default control scheme, movement is controlled using the D-pad, and aiming is controlled by dragging the stylus along the touchscreen. Metroid Prime Hunters features a multiplayer mode that supports up to four players and includes voice chat capability. In it, the player is able to control Samus or one of six other bounty hunters featured in the single-player mode. Each bounty hunter has a unique alternative form, such as Samus's Morph Ball, and a special weapon. The game host can set options for point and time limits, and restrict the use of radar. Computer-controlled players of varying skill levels can be added to games if the minimum of four players is not met. Synopsis =Setting and characters= Metroid Prime Hunters takes place between Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, and is set within the Alimbic Cluster in the Tetra Galaxy, where it was once ruled by the Alimbic race. One day, the Alimbic race disappeared without warning, leaving artifacts scattered throughout the solar system. In the present, a telepathic message is sent from the Cluster to bounty hunters and other intelligent species, stating the key to the \\"ultimate power\\" resides there. The solar system consists of two planets (Alinos and Arcterra) and two space stations (the Celestial Archives and the Vesper Defense Outpost). The protagonist of the single-player \\"adventure mode\\" is bounty hunter Samus Aran, who investigates the Alimbic Cluster after the Galactic Federation receives a telepathic message. During the investigation, Samus is confronted by six other bounty hunters: Sylux, a deadly sharpshooter who harbors a strong hatred for the Federation and Samus by association; Weavel, a cybernetic Space Pirate warrior who was injured in a battle with Samus; Trace, a feared member of the Kriken Empire; Kanden, a lab experiment and a supersoldier that was invincible; Noxus, a bounty hunter of the proud and reclusive Vhozon race; and Spire, the last of the silicon-based Diamonts.Official Nintendo Player's Guide 2006. \\"The Hunters\\". pp. 4‚Äì11. =Plot= The governing body of the galaxy, the Galactic Federation, receives a strange telepathic message. The Federation broadcasts a message to bounty hunter Samus Aran, asking her to investigate and retrieve the \\"ultimate power\\", and should it prove irretrievable, to keep it secret or destroy it outright. Six other bounty hunters intercept the transmission and proceed to the Alimbic solar system to claim the power for themselves.Official Nintendo Player's Guide 2006. \\"Adventure Mode\\". pp. 20‚Äì67.

Development Metroid Prime Hunters was developed by Nintendo Software Technology, which is based in alt=A gray, nondescript building with \\"Nintendo\\" written on the top floor, and with trees in the foreground. The development team for Metroid Prime Hunters at Nintendo Software Technology (NST) was led by the game's director, Masamichi Abe and the lead technical engineer, Colin Reed, who had both previously worked together on several games, including the Nintendo games Pikmin and 1080¬∞ Snowboarding. The team for Hunters was composed of thirty people, which Abe noted was larger than the development team of most other Nintendo DS games. Kensuke Tanabe of Nintendo came up with the original idea for the game. Retro Studios, which developed previous Metroid Prime games, was unable to develop Metroid Prime Hunters because it was already working on a game. Therefore, Tanabe contacted NST with the idea, and let them develop it instead. NST developed the game instead of Nintendo themselves because Nintendo wanted the division to influence Metroid Prime Hunters with western ideals, styles, and presentation. While developing the game, most of NST's efforts were focused on its multiplayer aspect because of its first-person shooter gameplay, and to take advantage of the Wi-Fi and voice chat capabilities of the Nintendo DS. One of the game's designers, Richard Vorodi, noted that \\"the hardware kinda dictated [their focus onto the game's multiplayer mode].\\" Wanting to introduce a new element to the Metroid series, Abe created several new bounty hunters after he realized that the game's multiplayer mode and the new bounty hunters could both be implemented seamlessly into the game: \\"We had this idea early on and thought that would be a good way to introduce [Metroid Prime Hunters] and [the new bounty hunters] to the gameplay and take advantage of that in the multiplayer.\\" Metroid Prime Hunters includes several references to previous games in the Metroid Prime series. Samus' ship is from the original Metroid Prime, and her suit is the same one that appears in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. The developers decided to add them because they wanted to show that the technology has evolved, and they also wanted to include something that was instantly recognizable to those who had played previous games in the series. On level design, Abe said that as the game's controls shifted from an analog stick method to touchscreen aiming, the developers wanted to avoid making the gameplay and the control scheme more difficult. Metroid Prime Hunters was first revealed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2004, with IGN giving the game their Best Nintendo DS Game of E3 award. When Nintendo received negative feedback at E3 2005 about the game's lack of an online feature, the company announced in August 2005 that the game's release would be delayed to give the developers time to implement Nintendo WFC support. After the game's release was delayed to give NST time to implement the multiplayer feature, the developers took the time to make more changes. They worked on the game's framerate to make the graphics move more smoothly. The game's visuals were improved; a developer added reflections to the Morph Ball. The other developers admired the effect, and added it to other parts of the game. NST collaborated with Retro Studios, the company behind several Metroid games, to design the game's art and characters to make sure that they fit into the overall Metroid series. When asked why Metroid Prime Hunters was placed between Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes chronologically, Reed noted that the game was not influenced by the story of either game, so there were no continuity issues. He described Hunters as a side story to the Metroid Prime series. Marketing and release The demo version of the game, Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt, was bundled with the Nintendo DS at launch. A preview of Metroid Prime Hunters was featured at E3 2004, which players control different colored variations of Samus in a deathmatch. A demo version, titled Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt, was included as a pack-in game with the Nintendo DS when it launched in North America on November 21, 2004. As a single-player game, it consisted of training scenarios with no specific plot, while the multiplayer portion allowed up to four players to compete via the Nintendo DS' local wireless communications. GamesRadar wrote a positive review for the demo, citing it as \\"a fine showcase for demonstrating what the hardware is capable of\\". In early 2006, a preview video for Hunters was made available for download through the DS Download Station. A playable demo was also available from the Download Station in North America. Nintendo promoted the release of Metroid Prime Hunters in the United States with a television commercial, featuring a gravedigger burying dead bounty hunters in a futuristic setting. The commercial was directed by Len Wiseman, known for his work on the Underworld series, and was produced by the Leo Burnett Worldwide, while the special effects were handled by Ntropic. According to Wiseman, the commercial intends to \\"give the players a sense of how high the body count is going to be in this game, the amount of mayhem, and just how vicious Samus can be.\\" On May 20, 2006, Nintendo of Europe and HMV held the \\"Hunt Is On Tournament\\" competition in several locations throughout the United Kingdom, with BT Openzone provided a video link. Metroid Prime Hunters was released on March 20, 2006 in North America. This was followed by the release in Europe on May 5, 2006, in Australia on May 23, in Japan on June 1, and in South Korea on December 6, 2007. The game was later re-released on the Wii U's Virtual Console service, in Japan on September 30, 2015, in North America on June 2, 2016, and in Europe on September 15. Reception Metroid Prime Hunters was given \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to Metacritic. Several reviews praised the amount of value that Metroid Prime Hunters offered on the Nintendo DS handheld video game console. GameZone considered the game phenomenal, and believed that it used the DS to its maximum potential regarding graphical ability and innovation. The Toronto Sun remarked that the graphics were big enough selling points on their own for the game, and The Press called Metroid Prime Hunters the best-looking game for the Nintendo DS. The Australian agreed that the graphics are \\"outstanding\\" and push the Nintendo DS to its limits, and The Independent asserted that Metroid Prime Hunters was perhaps the best first-person shooter ever for a handheld console. GamePros review stated that \\"it's hard to imagine how Nintendo squeezed Hunters into a tiny DS cartridge.\\" Despite a few \\"small quirks\\", the magazine noted that Hunters \\"is a very polished game\\". The Times concurred with these claims, remarking, \\"A lot of thought has clearly gone into making the most of the DS's touch-screen capability here, and it works gloriously.\\" Game Revolution admired the \\"high- quality work\\" found in the game's production design and smooth online play. 1UP.com asserted that fans of the Metroid series should recognize the technical achievements that the game showcases. GamesRadar lauded Metroid Prime Hunters gameplay, and believed that the game was strictly for hardcore gamers \\"who live for fragfests\\". Convinced that making a Metroid game different from its slow-paced adventure predecessors into a \\"nail-biting wrecking ball\\" was a \\"risky trick\\", they appreciated the results, stating, \\"Damn did it ever work.\\" Both GameSpot and Game Informer enjoyed the game's \\"worthwhile\\" and \\"electrifying\\" multiplayer mode. Nintendo Power praised the game as a \\"new-school, action-packed\\" game that makes a \\"great addition to the growing collection of Wi-Fi titles\\", and The Guardian claimed the game's multiplayer aspect as their favorite feature. The Sunday Times wrote that Metroid Prime Hunters does a \\"staggering job\\" of replicating the style of previous Metroid Prime games. Complaints about the game stemmed primarily from its control scheme. IGN found that the high learning curve and \\"cramp- inducing\\" control scheme made it difficult to play. This sentiment was shared by Electronic Gaming Monthly, which claimed that placing the interface used to switch visors and weapons on the touchscreen made the process unnecessarily complex. The magazine was also disappointed with the game's single-player mode, claiming that it does not live up to the experience offered in previous games in the Metroid Prime series. They criticized the levels as \\"contrived and predictable\\", and noted that the designs felt too formulaic \\"after a few worlds of hunting for keys, fighting repeat bosses, and escaping before the bomb blows\\". The Washington Times agreed that the game's repetitiveness eventually grew tiring, and that \\"manipulating the DS controls will be a painfully cramped endeavor\\". Concurring with this sentiment, GameSpy noted that using the stylus to play the game felt a bit strange. Eurogamer also expressed their disapproval of the control scheme, predicting it would lead to \\"the coming years of physiotherapy on [their] arms\\". They were also unhappy with the game's \\"flimsy\\" multiplayer experience, noting that it is best used when played locally with friends who also have the game. X-Play had particularly negative sentiments about the game, stating, \\"This feels like yet another genre shoehorned poorly onto hardware that just isn‚Äôt equipped to handle it.\\" Metroid Prime Hunters was the fourth best-selling game in its debut month in Japan, selling 32,467 units, and has since sold over 90,000 units there. Over 410,000 units of the game were sold in North America in its first month. Hunters received several awards and honors. IGN gave it an \\"Editors' Choice\\" award, and named it the \\"Best DS Action Game\\" of 2006. The game also received the awards for \\"Best Graphics\\", \\"Best Shooter/Action Game\\", and \\"Best Wi-Fi Functionality\\" from Nintendo Power for 2006. Appearances in other games The bounty hunters in Metroid Prime Hunters are featured in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as unlockable character trophies. Sylux also makes a minor appearance in Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, where he follows Samus in the game's ending. Tanabe said in E3 2015 that he wanted to create a story that centers around Samus and Sylux, noting that \\"here's something going on between them. I want to make a game that touches upon .\\" With a Nintendo 3DS game, Metroid Prime: Federation Force, Tanabe hoped that Federation Force plot would lead to future Metroid Prime games based on the relationship between Samus and Sylux, with additional involvement from the Galactic Federation marines.

The railway passes through of countryside from to station, passing through the small village of Havenstreet, where the line has a station, headquarters and a depot. At Smallbrook Junction, the steam railway connects with the Island Line. Operation The railway is owned and operated by the Isle of Wight Railway Co. Ltd. and run largely by volunteers. Services are operated on most days from June to September, together with selected days in April, May, and October and public holidays. The railway is popular with tourists, attracting people to its original steam locomotive and railway cafe. Over each August Bank Holiday weekend, the railway organises the Island Steam Show, which combines an intensive service on the railway with displays of various sorts of steam power including traction engines and steam fair equipment, together with other attractions that vary year by year. For events like steam galas and Day out with Thomas events, engines from the mainland have to be brought in by boat and then transferred to Havenstreet. Rolling stock The railway has several steam locomotives and a small series of diesel shunters, four of which have had notable careers on the island. To complement the collection, numerous examples of pre-grouping carriages have been recovered and restored. The oldest of these were built in 1864 and the last in 1924. There are also more than 45 units of freight rolling stock, the oldest of which dates from circa 1860. Carriage shed To allow the railway's collection of Victorian and Edwardian carriages to be kept undercover, away from the effects of weather and vandals, a rolling stock storage and display building has been built at Havenstreet. A four-road shed, with each road capable of storing four bogie coaches or their equivalent, amounting to a total size of 75 by 25 metres has been built, and track work is currently being completed. By December 2008, ¬£71,000 had been raised by the railway, and as of May 2012, the railway was awaiting information to see if a grant application from the Heritage Lottery towards the ¬£815,000 cost was successful. This was successful and the shed is now operational with public access to see the stock inside. History The first railway on the Isle of Wight opened in 1862, linking Newport and Cowes. It became the nucleus of the Isle of Wight Central Railway. The line from Ryde to Newport was opened in 1875 and by 1890 the island was served by an extensive network of lines. However most of these lines were relatively poorly maintained and had a low level of traffic, reflecting the general isolation and poverty of the island. These factors meant that the island's railways could rarely afford to acquire new locomotives or rolling stock and instead relied on using already elderly equipment transferred from the mainland. Much of the equipment currently used on the Isle of Wight Steam Railway, and particularly the passenger coaching stock, falls into this category, representing usage on the island in the early and mid twentieth century but also the mid to late nineteenth century on the mainland. This is of particular historic interest as representing an earlier era than almost all other preserved railways in Britain. The steam locomotives used include examples well over 100 years old, but also some more modern types. The first railway closures on the Island were in 1952. Then in 1966 the Ryde‚ÄìNewport‚ÄìCowes and Shanklin‚ÄìVentnor lines were closed. The last steam services on the island ran on the remaining Ryde to Shanklin line on 31 December 1966. However a small group of rail enthusiasts formed the Wight Locomotive Society and raised funds to preserve one of the last steam locomotives, W24 Calbourne, and a number of the remaining carriages. Then, in 1971, the Isle of Wight Railway Co. Ltd. was formed to buy the length of track between Wootton and Havenstreet. From that early beginning, the railway has been gradually extended from Havenstreet towards Ryde. In 1991 this extension reached Smallbrook Junction on the Ryde ‚Äì Shanklin line, where a new interchange station was built there allowing passengers to interchange with Island Line trains. An extension of the line westwards from Wootton to Newport has been suggested in the past. It is unlikely that the full extent will ever be restored as there is now a road on the site of Newport station and houses have been built on another part of the former line. However a stretch of trackbed from Wootton to the outskirts of Newport at Halberry Lane is still free from development and could in theory be used in the future. Another possible extension is one from Smallbrook Junction to Ryde St John's Road station,Isle of Wight steam train comes to the rescue, Isle of Wight Radio using one of the two Island Line tracks on this stretch. Within the grounds of Havenstreet railway station is the Haven Falconry Bird of Prey Centre.

He succeeded Robert Oppenheimer, who personally chose Bradbury for the position of director after working closely with him on the Manhattan Project during World War II. Bradbury was in charge of the final assembly of \\"the Gadget\\", detonated in July 1945 for the Trinity test. Bradbury took charge at Los Alamos at a difficult time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor and there was a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel. In the 1950s Bradbury oversaw the development of thermonuclear weapons, although a falling out with Edward Teller over the priority given to their development led to the creation of a rival nuclear weapons laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. In later years, he branched out, constructing the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility to develop the laboratory's role in nuclear science, and during the Space Race of the 1960s, the laboratory developed the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). The Bradbury Science Museum is named in his honor.  Early life  Norris Bradbury was born in Santa Barbara, California, on 30 May 1909, one of four children of Edwin Pearly and his wife Elvira n√©e Clausen. One sister died as an infant, and the family adopted twins Bobby and Betty, both of whom served in the United States Marine Corps during World War II. Bradbury was educated at Hollywood High School and Chaffey High School in Ontario, California, graduating at the age of 16. He then attended Pomona College in Claremont, California, from which he graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in chemistry in 1929. This earned him membership of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. At Pomona, he met Lois Platt, an English Literature major who was the sister of his college roommate. They were married in 1933, and had three sons, James, John, and David. Bradbury became interested in physics, and did graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was a teaching fellow from 1929 to 1931, and then a Whiting Foundation fellow from 1931 to 1932. He submitted a PhD thesis on Studies on the mobility of gaseous ions under the supervision of Leonard B. Loeb, and was awarded a National Research Council fellowship. As well as supervising Bradbury's thesis, Loeb, who had served as a naval reservist during World War I, encouraged Bradbury to apply for a commission as a naval reservist. Bradbury's commission as an ensign was signed by Lieutenant Commander Chester W. Nimitz, who was the head of the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps at Berkeley at the time. After two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bradbury became an assistant professor of physics at Stanford University in 1935, rising to become an associate professor in 1938, and a full professor in 1943. He became an expert on the electrical conductivity of gases, the properties of ions, and the behavior of atmospheric electricity, publishing in journals including the Physical Review, Journal of Applied Physics, Journal of Chemical Physics, and the Journal of Atmospheric Electricity and Terrestrial Magnetism. He invented the Bradbury-Nielsen shutter, a type of electrical ion gate, widely used in mass spectrometry in both time-of-flight mass spectrometers and ion mobility spectrometers.  World War II  Bradbury was called up for service in World War II in early 1941, although the Navy allowed him to stay at Stanford until the end of the academic year. He was then sent to the Naval Proving Ground at Dahlgren, Virginia, to work on external ballistics. Already working at Dahlgren were Loeb and Commander Deak Parsons. Trinity Test, July 1945. Bradbury stands next to the partially assembled Gadget atop the test tower. In June 1944, Bradbury received orders from Parsons, who was now the Deputy Director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, to report to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Parsons explained that he needed Bradbury to work on the explosive lenses required by an implosion-type nuclear weapon. Bradbury was less than enthusiastic about the prospect, but he was a naval officer, and ultimately agreed to go. At Los Alamos, Bradbury became head of E-5, the Implosion Experimentation Group, which put him in charge of the implosion field test program. In August, the laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, implemented a sweeping reorganisation. E-5 became part of George Kistiakowsky's new Explosives Division (X Division), and was renumbered X-1. At this point, Bradbury was leading some of the most critical work at the laboratory, as it struggled with the jets that spoiled the perfect spherical shape desired for the implosion process. These were examined with a combination of magnetic, X-ray and RaLa techniques. In March 1945, Oppenheimer created Project Alberta under Parsons to carry out the Manhattan Project's ultimate mission: the preparation and delivery of nuclear weapons in combat. Bradbury was transferred to Project Alberta to head the Fat Man assembly group. In July 1945, Bradbury supervised the preparation of \\"the Gadget\\", as the bomb was known, at the Trinity nuclear test. \\"For me to say\\", Bradbury later recalled, \\"I had any deep emotional thoughts about Trinity... I didn't. I was just damned pleased that it went off.\\"  Director of Los Alamos  Bradbury (left) sits at a table with Leslie Groves of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (center) and Eric Jette Oppenheimer submitted his resignation as Director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, but remained until a successor could be found. The Director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted someone with both a solid academic background and a high standing within the project. Oppenheimer recommended Bradbury. This was agreeable to Groves, who liked the fact that as a naval officer Bradbury was both a military man and a scientist. Bradbury accepted the offer on a six-month trial basis. Parsons arranged for Bradbury to be quickly discharged from the Navy, which awarded him the Legion of Merit for his wartime services. He remained in the Naval Reserve, though, ultimately retiring in 1961 with the rank of captain. On 16 October 1945, there was a ceremony at Los Alamos at which Groves presented the laboratory with the Army-Navy \\"E\\" Award, and presented Oppenheimer with a certificate of appreciation. Bradbury became the laboratory's second director the following day. The first months of Bradbury's directorship were particularly difficult. He had hoped that Atomic Energy Act of 1946 would be quickly passed by Congress and the wartime Manhattan Project would be superseded by a new, permanent organization. It soon became clear that this would take more than six months. President Harry S. Truman did not sign the act creating the Atomic Energy Commission into law until 1 August 1946, and it did not become active until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, Groves' legal authority to act was limited. Most of the scientists at Los Alamos were eager to return to their laboratories and universities, and by February 1946 all of the wartime division heads had left, but a talented core remained. Darol Froman became head of Robert Bacher's G division, now renamed M Division. Eric Jette became responsible for Chemistry and Metallurgy, John H. Manley for Physics, George Placzek for Theory, Max Roy for Explosives, and Roger Wagner for Ordnance. The number of personnel at Los Alamos plummeted from its wartime peak of over 3,000 to around 1,000, but many were still living in temporary wartime accommodation. To make matters worse, the water pipe to Los Alamos froze and the water had to be supplied by tanker trucks. Despite the reduced staff, Bradbury still had to provide support for Operation Crossroads, the nuclear tests in the Pacific. Bradbury (left) in front of the Kiwi B4-A reactor used to power a nuclear rocket Bradbury pushed continued development of nuclear weapons to take them from laboratory devices to production models. There were numerous improvements that could make them more safe, reliable and easy to store and handle, and make more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel. While Bradbury gave priority to improved fission weapons, research still continued on \\"Alarm Clock\\", a boosted nuclear weapon, and the \\"Super\\", a thermonuclear weapons design. The new fission designs were tested during Operation Sandstone in 1948. The Mark 4 nuclear bomb became the first nuclear weapon to be mass-produced on an assembly line. As the future became more certain, Bradbury began looking for a new site for the laboratory away from the crowded town center. In 1948, Bradbury submitted a proposal to the Atomic Energy Commission for a new $107 million facility on the South Mesa, linked to the town by a new bridge over the canyon. All this time, Bradbury remained nominally a professor in absentia at Stanford. The Los Alamos Laboratory was nominally run under a wartime contract with the University of California, but a clause in the contract allowed the University to terminate the contract three months after the end of the war. The university duly served notice, but Bradbury managed to get it rescinded, and in 1948 the contract was renewed. In 1951, he became a professor at the University of California. By 1951, the laboratory had come up with the Teller-Ulam design, and thermonuclear tests were conducted during Operation Greenhouse. Tensions between Bradbury and Edward Teller over the degree of priority given to thermonuclear weapons development led to the creation of a second nuclear weapons laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. In later years, Bradbury branched out, constructing the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility to develop the laboratory's role in nuclear science. During the Space Race of the 1960s, the laboratory worked on Project Rover, developing the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). The laboratory demonstrated the feasibility and value of nuclear rocket propulsion. For many years, Bradbury was responsible for much of the administration of the town of Los Alamos. The town established impressive health and education facilities. Eventually the new technical area was built outside the town, and on 18 February 1957 the security gates were taken down. Finally, the town became an incorporated community and the director's civic responsibilities ended. In 1966, Bradbury was awarded the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service for \\"exceptionally meritorious civilian service to the Armed Forces and the United States of America in a position of great responsibility as director, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory\\". His citation went on to say that \\"The outstanding international reputation of the Los Alamos Laboratory is directly attributable to his exceptional leadership. The United States is indebted to Dr. Bradbury and his laboratory, to a very large degree, for our present nuclear capability.\\" He also received the Enrico Fermi Award in 1970. In 1971, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.  Later life  Bradbury with his predecessor Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1964 Bradbury retired as director of Los Alamos Laboratory in 1970. His successor, Harold Agnew, invited him to become a senior consultant, but Bradbury declined the offer, although he did serve as a consultant for other government agencies, including the National Academy of Sciences, and as a member of the boards of the Los Alamos Medical Center, the First National Bank of Santa Fe, the Los Alamos YMCA and the Santa Fe Neurological Society. In 1969 the Governor of New Mexico, David Cargo, appointed Bradbury as a regent of the University of New Mexico, but this was a turbulent time for the university. In response to the Kent State Shootings in May 1970, students and antiwar activist Jane Fonda marched on the home of Ferrel Heady, the President of the University of New Mexico. When he refused to meet with them, the students called a strike. Classes were cancelled, rallies were held and students occupied the Student Union Building. Cargo called in the New Mexico National Guard to remove them, and eleven people were bayoneted. Cargo's successor, Bruce King, replaced Bradbury and another regent. In the mid-1990s, Bradbury accidentally hit his leg while chopping firewood. Gangrene set in, and his right leg was amputated below the knee. It spread to his left leg, and part of his left foot was amputated, leaving him in a wheelchair. The disease eventually proved fatal, and he died on 20 August 1997. He was survived by his wife Lois, who died in January 1998, and his three sons. A funeral service was held in Los Alamos, and he was buried at Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos.

It is also used for manual transportation of patients for short distances (it replaces the stretcher). It was invented by Loed and Haederl√©, who called it \\"shell\\" mattress (matelas coquille in French).  Medical uses  The full spine immobilisation (splint) is performed with: a rigid cervical collar, a vacuum mattress, and a stretcher under it (the longitudinal stiffness of the mattress alone is not sufficient). = Preparation of the vacuum mattress = preparation of the vacuum mattress The vacuum mattress is put on a stretcher or possibly on a long spine board. The straps are put under the mattress, along its side, so they do not reach the ground. Then, the polystyrene balls are distributed evenly through the mattress by shaking its surface. (A section with fewer balls would be less rigid, conversely if balls are concentrated at any given point this becomes more rigid.) A sheet is put on the mattress, folded so it will be possible to pull it to wrap the casualty into using an S-fold and finally a team member should double-check the pump (manual or electrical) is set to either pump air out of the bag. = Moulding the mattress = moulding of the vacuum mattress There are three ways to put the casualty on the vacuum mattress: * lifting the casualty and pushing the stretcher under it. This method requires a minimum of five team members (four lifting and one pushing the stretcher) and should be used when a spine or a pelvis trauma are suspected; * the casualty is lifted with a scoop stretcher. The scoop stretcher is put on the mattress and opened to release the casualty; * the casualty is lifted on a long spine board. The board is put on the mattress and the casualty is lifted (best with four team members) and one team member removes the board. In all cases, the vacuum valve is up and at the feet of the casualty. Once the casualty is on the mattress, the sheet is wrapped around him/her and the sides of the mattress are folded against their body. The top of the head must be kept clear (the mattress could retract when pumping out the air and thus compress the spine). The air is pumped until the mattress is rigid, then the valve is closed and the straps are fastened. When only three team members are available and there is no scoop stretcher, the following procedure can be used: # the vacuum mattress is put besides the casualty, on a protecting ground sheet, and partially depressed (three manual pumping) to make it more rigid and thinner. A sheet is put on the mattress, closer to the casualty; # the casualty is put on their side, with a procedure that is similar to the recovery position; # the team member at the legs pushes the mattress against the back of the casualty. The ground sheet helps to slide the mattress on the floor; # the casualty is put on their back, overlapping the side of the mattress; # the casualty is centred on the mattress; the sheet helps sliding the casualty on the mattress; # the straps are tied to mould the mattress. The team leader moulds the sides of the head manually; # the air is pumped; # a long spine board is placed along the axis of the mattress. Two team members face each other and hold the mattress's handles at the head and at the thighs. They lift a few centimetres, the ground sheet is removed and the board is slid under the mattress to ensure longitudinal rigidity; # the board can then be lifted (with the mattress on it), and put on the stretcher. While the lifting methods can induce a flexing of the spine, this rolling method can be hazardous for several reasons: the risk of a torsion of the spine when rolling, the risk when sliding the casualty on the mattress, the risk of anteversion of the hips (and thus of flexing of the spine) due to the weight of the legs when lifting the mattress to slide the board.  Advantages and disadvantages  The vacuum mattress is an alternative to the use of a long spine board. Its advantages are: * Comfort. * Being adaptable to all traumas (included spinal and femoral traumas). * The patient is held more securely. * The patient is more easily transported short distances provided sufficient team members (typically six) are available, and in confined spaces compared to a conventional stretcher. * Distributes pressure more equally on body surfaces, leading to lower risk for pressure ulcer formation compared to a long board Its drawbacks include: * Relatively fragile (useless unless a perfect vacuum is maintained). * Increased cost relative to a traditional long spine board * The time taken to evacuate the bag compared to readily available standard spinal board. Operation A vacuum mattress consists of a sealed air-tight (typically polymer) bag enclosing small beads (typically polystyrene balls) and fitted with one or more valves. While at ambient air pressure, the beads free to move, but when the mattress has been moulded and the air evacuated, external atmospheric pressure locks the beads in place (jamming) and the mattress becomes rigid. When used medically this principle allows a patient who is put onto the mattress (e.g. with a scoop stretcher), the sides of the mattress arranged around the patient and when the air inside is evacuated the mattress forms a conformal cradle allowing an injury to be stabilised, straps fastened, and the patient protected sufficiently well that they can be transported.

Introduced as the protagonist of the 2001 game with the same name, Dante is a demon-hunting vigilante dedicated to exterminating them and other supernatural foes in revenge for losing his mother Eva and having his twin brother, Vergil, lost. He is the son of Sparda, inheriting superhuman powers which he uses with a variety of weapons in the games. The character also appears in several Devil May Cry novels and manga volumes and is featured in the 2007 anime television series. Dante has also made multiple guest appearances in crossover games. An alternate version of the character was created by Ninja Theory for their game DmC: Devil May Cry, which is set in a separate universe from the main series. Named after the Italian poet Dante Alighieri, the character was designed to fit Devil May Cry game designer Hideki Kamiya's vision of a \\"cool and stylish\\" man; his personality was based on the title character of the Cobra manga series. Dante has been modified in response to criticism in his role in Devil May Cry 2 as his personality changed making him more serious and less talkative, drifting away from his original persona. Devil May Cry 3 features a young, cocky Dante, and in the following games an older yet still cocky Dante. Capcom handles the character in the main Devil May Cry series, while Ninja Theory oversaw his persona in DmC: Devil May Cry. Dante's characterization as a cocky demon hunter with supernatural abilities has turned him into one of the most iconic protagonists in gaming ever since his introduction. Reuben Langdon's voice acting that started in Devil May Cry 3 has also been the subject of praise due to the tone he gives to the character. Comparatively, his redesign and characterization in DmC: Devil May Cry was highly controversial for the drastic change of his appearance, most notably his iconic white hair.  Concept and influences  Early sketch of Dante by Makoto Tsuchibayashi for the scrapped Resident Evil game. Dante debuted in Devil May Cry, a game originally intended as part of Capcom's Resident Evil franchise. Series creator Hideki Kamiya rewrote the story, taking it from Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. He was originally going to be a Western policeman. His early name, Tony Redgrave, served as a reference to one of the characters from Resident Evil, Chris Redfield. According to Kamiya, the title character of Buichi Terasawa's Cobra manga series was the basis of Dante's personality. To give the character's \\"stylishness\\" he dressed him in a long coat to make him \\"showy\\" and made him a non-smoker; Kamiya saw that as \\"more cool\\". Dante wears red clothing‚Äîthe traditional Japanese color for a heroic figure‚Äîin contrast to Leon S. Kennedy, a character Kamiya created for Resident Evil 2, who wears blue clothes. Kamiya said that he saw Dante as \\"a character that you would want to go out drinking with\\", someone who was not a show-off but would \\"pull some ridiculous, mischievous joke\\" instead to endear people to him (and make the character familiar to audiences). When asked about the relationship between Dante and Trish, Kamiya said their bond was superior to love. Kamiya's keywords when describing the character were \\"composure\\" and \\"ambiance\\". Although Kamiya was not the main writer of the first two Devil May Cry novels, he saw Shinya Goikeda's depiction of Dante as similar to his own. In development, Dante was originally called Tony Redgrade and did not carry a sword. Devil May Cry was designed from the ground up around Dante's acrobatics and combat abilities. Kamiya gave Tsuchibayashi freedom when designing Dante though there were concept arts Kamiya did not accept. Tsuchibayashi produced the 3D model based on other staff member's clothing and an unclear relationship between Dante and Trish. The Devil Trigger form gave him difficulties to the idea of giving him wings and altering his face, resulting in the artist performing to many sketches. An alternate outfit was developed featuring an older Dante though the designer never asked for specifics about. Nevertheless, he believes this design made Dante look more like Vergil. Tsuchibayashi claims other sketches did not provide more difficulties as there was no need to match his personality. Hideaki Itsuno claimed that for Devil May Cry 5, Dante was influenced by mecha anime he watched when he was young. Itsuno cited the character's conflict with his family but while showing powers that would reveal mechas. Itsuno views Dante's early defeat by Vergil's alterego Urizen and his awakening of new devil powers alongside his new sword Dante as one of the most important changes in his characterization in Devil May Cry 5. =Redesigns= After the success of the first Devil May Cry game, Capcom inserted Dante into a game already in development. This necessitated the maturing of his characterisation. Dante's change to a more-taciturn character was a decision made by a producer who disliked his previous incarnation. The staff aimed to make him look older‚Äîin his 30s‚Äîthan his original self, implying that something dramatic had happened to change his personality. Dante and Lucia dressed in Diesel fashions appealed to the developers. Dante's final design was left up to Kamiya, who discussed with Bingo Morihashi how the character should be portrayed. Kamiya felt that early depictions of Dante were too quiet and wanted a character who was more \\"wild\\" and wore different clothing (such as his sleeveless jacket). Dante appears bare-chested underneath his coat, something that surprised the audience. This design was meant to fit his young personality as well as contrast Vergil's fully clothed looked. Additionally, similar to Dante's longsword and red clothing, Vergil was also made to wield a Japanese katana and wear blue clothing. Ikeno said he liked the character but had issues with it. Dante's Devil Trigger forms were designed by Kazuma Kaneko of Atlus. The Capcom staff was impressed with Kaneko's work, and Ikeno felt that it was not difficult to model. A wallpaper with Dante and Vergil's Devil Trigger forms was designed as a tribute to the Japanese show Super Sentai once defeating the game. Dante was designed to be easy to control, in contrast to Vergil who was more difficult but stronger. Dante was designed in that game by Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who called the character in his original appearance \\"the ultimate Hollywood action superstar\\". Yoshikawa wanted to make Dante older in his 30s or 40s. His design included a stubble which reflected his \\"cool\\" personality since he did not care about shaving. For Devil May Cry 4, Dante's body was more suitable for fighting and his personality was more intense; Yoshikawa emphasised the character's sternness and naughtiness. Dante was given a variety of costumes, with one intended to indicate mystery. Several weapons in the series are character-specific. One is Pandora, a firearm designed by Kobayashi who noted that he wanted to include a \\"transforming, multi-purpose AWD in Dante's arsenal. Something that could be used as an over-the-shoulder rocket launcher, or a crossbow, etc. In its final form, I wanted it to transform into something that would be even bigger than Dante himself.\\" The weapon was inspired by anime series such as Macross and Gundam. The staff felt that Dante received more missions and weapons than they had originally intended. Dante and Nero's appearances were changed in the E3 2018 trailer for Devil May Cry 5, confusing fans who wondered if Nero was Dante. After seeing the older Dante at the trailer's end, Capcom noted that fans realised who was who and were pleased with the designs. While designing this incarnation of the character, a total of six outfits were produced until the final one was chosen. As a \\"weathered devil hunter\\", his leather rider's jacket had custom stitching tailored to fit his body, so it is easier to get around in. Like his Devil May Cry 4 design, Dante reflects the idea of a man who does not care about others' opinions of his look. Both his and Nero's designs were developed to fit their personalities. According to the company, Dante \\"hasn't gone wild for no reason\\". Because the graphics of the game are meant to be as realistic as possible, Dante's face was modeled after an actor named Adam Cowie. =Personality= In Devil May Cry 2, The staff felt that Dante's stylishness remained true to the original character (despite his change in personality) because of his movements. Daigo Ikeno was responsible for Dante's appearance in Devil May Cry 2 and 3. In developing the former, he attempted to make Dante more handsome. In retrospect, Ikeno was disappointed with the character's inaction in the game. In the prequel game, Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening, Dante was a younger, more arrogant character than in the previous instalments. The designers of Devil May Cry 2 returned to design his new look, which was based on the Japanese band Johnnys. This Dante showed more skin under his jacket which the staff believed would fit his younger persona. Trying to remain true to Kamiya's original idea, the staff worked carefully to make his actions and personality appealing. Bingo Morihashi said that Dante's characterisation was meant as a departure from Kamiya's style, and more of a team effort. According to Morihashi, despite seeing the character in three games, he had trouble understanding him. Although Dante is a strong character, he opens up to others. Fan response to this Dante led Morihashi to say that the team was inspired by the Devil May Cry Dante but needed to change him. Nevertheless, the character's role in facing the world affected the writer. Dante and his identical twin brother Vergil represents one of the themes of Devil May Cry 3‚Äîfamilial love. While initially Dante only wishes to have fun while fighting demons, he is moved by Lady's determination to stop her father. He decides to stop Lady's corrupted father as well as Vergil who wishes to open the gate to the demon world. Devil May Cry 4 producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi noted before the game's release that they aimed to make Dante seem significantly more powerful than its other protagonist, Nero, to create a difference between the strength of a \\"veteran\\" compared with a \\"rookie\\"; the series' continuity also dictated that Dante display the power he possessed after the events of the first game and its prequel (Devil May Cry 3). The introduction of a new protagonist had been discussed multiple times but was only approved under the condition that Dante also had to be featured in the game. The staff were afraid of negative feedback similar to what had happened to Konami's 2001 game Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, which proved highly controversial because of switching protagonists. As a result, the team tried balancing Dante and Nero's strength. Due to the physical similarities between Dante and Nero, the staff aimed to make their designs unique and make their personalities stand out in their interactions with other characters. An example was the Devil May Cry 4 antagonist, Agnus. Nero remained at odds with Agnus in cutscenes, but Dante mocked Agnus in a musical taunt before the boss fight with him which signified how different the two playable characters were in terms of personality. Itsuno initially found Dante's motivations in early games simple: \\"Beat this bad guy.\\" With Devil May Cry 5, the goal was to imbue curiosity and drive. Matt Walker pointed to Dante's desire to see if Urizen was connected to his brother Vergil, giving further depth to his characterisation. The character's early defeat at the hands of Urizen coupled with the destruction of his sword Rebellion was meant to emphasise Dante's weak powers set by the narrative and how, across it, he would gain new skills to face the antagonist in a rematch. Furthermore, Dante and Nero would respect one and other as they became friends at the end of the previous game. The game's climactic event where Nero awakens his demonic powers and stops the struggle between Dante and Vergil was meant to give the story a deeper form. With regard to how Dante would play, Itsuno said he would be more like his Devil May Cry 3 persona. Nevertheless, he said that Dante is more mature from a personality standpoint since he still wishes to protect humanity and honour the legacy of his father, Sparda. =Fighting style= Artist Yuichiro Hiraki felt Dante looked like a \\"nihilistic anti-hero with a bit of a dark side\\", based on his early concept art by character designer Makoto Tsuchibayashi. As a result, he wrote him as a character who would rely on his demonic powers, during the game. Shortly after the game's development, Kamiya said that his personality would be more animated (which gave Hiraki the idea that Dante would be an \\"incorrigible joke-cracker\\") and the Devil Trigger was downplayed. Hiraki began drawing the character stylishly, working on Dante's gameplay, his swordsmanship and his handling of the guns (Ebony and Ivory). Other gameplay elements were based on the fighting-game series Virtua Fighter and Tekken. Dante's use of a shotgun was retained for Capcom's horror game, Resident Evil 4. Hiraki did not find the use fireweapon as stylish but then changed his mind upon watching the film Mad Max. The combination between Dante's swordsmanship and usage of guns with unlimited ammo made the character feel more unique according to Hiraki before the concept of Devil May Cry was conceived. More acrobatic skills were decided by Kamiya in the making of the game including double jumps despite the initial concept of the game as well as flying when Dante used Devil Trigger. This generated difficulties in the designers from the game. To balance the two protagonists, Dante and Nero were given unique gameplay; Dante retained his change of styles from Devil May Cry 3 but could now change between each of them within a battle rather than a stage. For Devil May Cry 5, Dante and Nero's characters were developed to play completely different in a similar fashion to Devil May Cry 4 as they employ different mechanics. Itsuno still felt that mastering Dante's skills would be more difficult as a result of the multiple mode and weaponry he executes.< The weapon Balrog, which acts as a reference to Street Fighter character Balrog, was the first weapon conceived by the team. It was made to be one of the most appealing weapons but at the same time the hardest to master. The motorcycle that works as a weapon, Cavaliere, was based on a Devil May Cry 2 picture somebody drew based on a motorcycle. =Ninja Theory redesign= Dante in DmC: Devil May Cry For DmC: Devil May Cry, a reboot of the series, Dante was completely redesigned by Italian concept artist Alessandro Taini (known as Talexi), in response to comments by the Capcom staff. Although his original design was meant to resemble those in previous games, Capcom told the Ninja Theory staff that he needed a redesign to appeal to a younger demographic. Motohide Eshiro said that this Dante was completely different from the previous ones, which was expected to generate criticism. Although the original Dante was designed from a Japanese perspective, the new version was made from a Western perspective. After several drafts of Dante's new appearance, the designers settled on a look inspired by Christopher Nolan's film The Dark Knight. Dante's coat is shorter, only reaching his lower back; his hair is black and shorter, and he has a Devil Trigger form which resembles the original Dante. Art designer Alessandro Taini drew the character as a child and explained in the reboot's origin story why he has white hair. Design director Tameem Antoniades denied rumours that Dante was modeled on him. Dante was made young in this game, inexperienced and consumed by hatred; his fighting style was more like a street brawler than a skilled swordsman. DmC: Devil May Crys theme is rebellion, and most of Dante's actions are based on it. Antoniades said that Dante is about \\"being cool and making you feel cool when you're playing it\\", and they felt that his attire from previous games would be found comical. Antoniades added that the original Dante was no longer appealing, and when he compared the new Dante with the title character in Bayonetta, her style was not what he wanted for DmC: Devil May Cry. Antoniades responded to criticism by saying that Dante would not be changed (since the character suits the game's setting), and that he liked the new version. =Casting= In the first Devil May Cry game, Dante was voiced by Drew Coombs. Coombs was happy to be chosen to voice him, since it was his first job involving a video-game character, and he found the game's recording process fun. According to Coombs, he was offered a script for the job and was told that Devil May Cry was a \\"spin-off\\" of Resident Evil. He said that he did not wear anything special while playing the character and had basic storyboards in front of him when his movements were videotaped. Asked if he recognized himself in the character's actions, Coombs said that he could not think of anything in particular; his main job was to \\"bring [Dante] alive\\" with his voice. Matt Kaminsky voiced Dante in the sequel. Toshiyuki Morikawa is Dante's Japanese actor. Dante was voiced by Reuben Langdon, who also did motion capture for some scenes in Devil May Cry 3, 4 and 5. Langdon auditioned for the character four times before he was chosen. Although he played the first Devil May Cry game, he was not aware of the title's popularity. Before the release of Devil May Cry 3, Langdon said that fans were angry with the new teenage Dante's look. After its release, however, he said that the fans had come to enjoy the character's new incarnation. Langdon enjoyed his work on the game, saying that \\"it was one of the most difficult, frustrating and yet rewarding character of anyone I've ever played\\". As Langdon faced difficulties with the work, he was thankful towards cast director Mary Elizabeth McGlynn as well as Yutaka Maseba from ADR Production who helped him in the making of the game. He felt that he could enjoy the character even more in Devil May Cry 4. During the development of Devil May Cry 3, Langdon found Dante's motion capture difficult. He consulted the staff, since they wanted \\"a different spin\\" on the character. Eventually, Langdon decided to do his own rendition of Dante because the staff's suggestions confused him. He was told to make Devil May Cry 4s Dante similar to his Devil May Cry 3 persona, but more mature. Despite the staff's concern about the difficulty of such a portrayal, Langdon had no issues after choosing Roy Focker of the anime series The Super Dimension Fortress Macross (who was near Dante's age) as his character model. Langdon said that his favorite motion capture scene from the series was Dante's banter with the antagonist Agnus during Devil May Cry 4 as they did a take on Japanese stage play originally designed by Yuji Shimura. In the making of Devil May Cry 5, Langdon did not like reading the script for the first time. Although he enjoyed the story and characters, Langdon claims the initial draft dialogue was \\"horrible\\" and had to rewrite some parts. Translator Mike NcNamara reworked the original dialogue much to Langdon's liking alongside Itsuno's. Langdon worked along with Dan Southworth and Johnny Yong Bosch to improve the English translation of the dialogue which they enjoyed. He found Dante as a more over-the-top character than Nero due to Bosch's acting and his handling of calm scenes. During one scene, Dante performs a parody to one of Michael Jackson's dances which the staff knew Langdon could not perform in motion capture. As a result, this scene was performed by an stunt double known as Shibata. For the Japanese Devil May Cry installments, Dante was given a Japanese voice actor: Toshiyuki Morikawa. Morikawa believes that the character's appeal stems from his courage and lack of concern about money. Overseeing his characterisation, Morikawa joked that female viewers would only enjoy seeing him fight; he is less adept at daily life, and constantly interested in eating. However, he said that Dante might have sex appeal which would attract female viewers. Tim Phillipps did Dante's motion capture and voice acting in DmC: Devil May Cry. During auditions for the game, he was quickly selected by Antoniades. The actor had no knowledge of the franchise or the reboot until the reveal teaser. He was disappointed that DmC was not an online game since those games allow him to interact more and demonstrate his work. Phillipps enjoyed Dante's characterisation, he could relate to him, and the motion capture enhanced his interest. Thinking that DmC was a prequel rather than a reboot, Phillips did not play the previous games before he worked on Dante's character.  Characteristics  Dante is a mercenary and private investigator specialising in paranormal cases, preferring those which require demon-slaying.Trish:\\"So, you must be the handyman who'll take any dirty job, am I correct?\\" Dante: Almost. I only take special jobs, if you know what I mean. (Devil May Cry) Capcom, 2001 He is muscular, with silverish white hair and piercing icy blue eyes, and usually wears a red duster or trench coat. Dante's arsenal usually consists of firearms and melee weapons, including ‚Äîtwin semi-automatic handguns which never need reloading‚Äîand a variety of swords, such as the Rebellion, Force Edge and various \\"Devil Arms\\" created from the demons he defeats souls. The guns are handmade by the gunsmith Nell Goldstein, with \\"For Tony Redgrave, By .45 Art Warks\\" written on the slides (Tony Redgrave is Dante's alias).Shinya Goikeda, Devil May Cry Volume 1, TokyoPop, 2006 He has superhuman strength, agility, stamina, reflexes, coordination, and a resistance to injury approaching invulnerability as a result of his half-demon heritage.Dante: Even as a child I had powers, there is demonic blood in me. ‚Äî This gives him the ability to enter a heightened state known as Devil Trigger. In this state Dante possesses greater strength and speed, his health regenerates at a steady pace, and he has greater abilities (including flight) with his melee weapon. He is one of the twin sons of Sparda, a demon knight who sided with humanity and drove back an invasion of the human world by demons about 2,000 years before the series' events.Narrator: Two millenniums ago there was a war, between the human world and the other, the underworld, but somebody from the underworld woke up to justice and stood up against this legion, alone. His name was Sparda. Later he quietly reigned the human world and continued to preserve harmony until his death. He became a legend the legendary dark knight, Sparda. ‚Äî After Sparda's death, Dante and Vergil were raised by their human mother Eva. When Dante and Vergil were children, the family was attacked by demons, and Eva was murdered. His mother's death led to Dante's commitment to hunt the demons who killed her.Trish: You're the man who lost a mother and a brother to evil twenty years ago, the son of the Legendary Dark Knight Sparda, Mr. Dante. / Dante: Well the way I figure it, in this business a lot of your kind come along, and if I kill each one that comes, eventually I should hit the jackpot sooner or later. ‚Äî Dante is confident against opponents, frequently taunting enemies before fighting them. In the games and anime series, Dante is often seen eating pizza. As a result, the limited editions of Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition were packaged in a pizza box.  Appearances  = Devil May Cry video games = In the original Devil May Cry from 2001, Dante is hired by Trish, a mysterious woman who resembles his late mother, to prevent the return of the devil king Mundus. However, Trish is actually arranging for Mundus' agents to kill Dante as he makes his way to him. One of the agents is the armored solider Nelo Angelo later revealed to be the mindcontrolled Vergil, Dante's brother. After multiple encounters, Dante defeats Vergil whose body is destroyed, leaving an amulet necessary to unlock their father's legacy, the sword . Trish tries to kill Dante afterwards but Dante spares her when becoming victorious. When Mundus tries to kill Dante, Trish passes Dante her strength to destroy the devil king. Now allied, they become partners in Dante's demon-slaying business, now renamed Devil Never Cry. In the first sequel, Devil May Cry 2, from 2003, Dante habitually flips a coin to make decisions; at the end of the game, it is revealed that both sides of the coin are heads. Set some time after the first game, Devil May Cry 2 focuses on helping Lucia defeat Arius, an international businessman who uses demonic power and wants to conquer the world. At the end of the game, Dante must go into the demon world to stop a demon lord from escaping; the gate closes behind him, and he is trapped. With no way back to the human world, Dante heads deeper into the demon world on his motorcycle. The third game, Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening, from 2005 is a prequel of the first game and features a cockier, younger Dante. He is drawn out by Vergil, who is trying to reopen the portal to the demon world to obtain Sparda's full power, which remains on the other side in the Force Edge sword. Dante meets Lady, who is in pursuit of her father Arkham who is working with Vergil but has plans of his own. Inspired by Lady's courage and commitment to her family, Dante continues his business with a greater sense of purpose. At the end of the game, Dante claims ownership of the Force Edge, and Vergil chooses to remain in the demon world. Dante and Lady befriend, with the former deciding to call his shop Devil May Cry after something Lady had said to comfort him. In the 2008 video game Devil May Cry 4, which takes place after Devil May Cry and Devil May Cry 2, Dante and Trish are informed by Lady that Sanctus, the religious leader of the Order of the Sword founded under Sparda, is using the religious order to engineer his scheme of world conquest. Trish infiltrates the Order as Gloria to confirm it is Sanctus by handing him Vergil's Yamato sword. Dante ends up as a boss character against the game's protagonist, Nero, when he seemingly assassinated Sanctus. Dante falls back while convincing Nero that the Order is more than it appears. Dante later befriends Nero in another match, having intended to take back Vergil's restored sword before deciding to let Nero keep it as they now have a common enemy in Sanctus. After Sanctus kidnaps Nero to use him to power the Savior, Dante becomes playable for the second half of the game as he fights to disable Sanctus completely while saving Nero and his girlfriend Kyrie after they were used to give life to the Savior colossus that Sanctus made into his vessel. Once Sanctus and the Savior are destroyed after Nero and Kyrie escape, Dante entrusts Nero with Vergil's sword. Dante makes a return appearance as one of the main characters in Devil May Cry 5 in 2019. He is hired by a mysterious man who calls himself V to battle the demon Urizen but is defeated by him in the game's opening scene, presume to be dead as he ends up missing after his defeat. It is revealed that he spent the next month in a coma protected by the sword Sparda. V eventually manages to locate him, and he spends the next several hours fighting Urizen's forces. Dante uses Rebellion's power to absorb the Sparda into himself, acquiring his new demonic powers alongside a new blade simply named . He still discourages Nero from taking part in the battle against Urizen, having learned that Urizen is Vergil, who is also revealed to be Nero's father. After Dante defeats Urizen, V merges with him to reconstitute Vergil. Dante reveals that Vergil is Nero's father before facing his brother in a climactic duel, but Nero intervenes and forces the two to reconcile. Dante and Vergil embark on a one-way trip to the underworld to cut the Qliphoth's root and to seal the portal with the Yamato, leaving the human world in Nero's hands. In the final scene, Dante is shown sparring with Vergil in the underworld, no longer as enemies but as friendly rivals while at the same time fending off waves of demons. Dante is a playable character in the mobile phone game Devil May Cry: Pinnacle of Combat. During the game's development players criticised Yunchang Games for their rendition of Dante's appearances which resulted into the developers' promising to fix it once the game left the beta period and was released in 2020. = DmC: Devil May Cry = In DmC: Devil May Cry (2013), a Devil May Cry reboot, Dante has a very different appearance. In his early twenties, he is attacked in a seemingly sentient town known as Limbo City which is inhabited by demons. Dante meets Vergil, who is the leader of the Order‚Äîa rogue vigilante group trying to free the world from demons. The city is controlled by the demon king, Mundus, who killed Dante's mother Eva (an angel), and imprisoned his father, Sparda, (a demon and Mundus' former lieutenant), as well as attempting to kill their children, who are revealed to be Nephilim, half-angel, half- demon offspring, with the power to destroy Mundus. Dante joins Vergil's group to oppose Mundus, eventually defeating him and freeing humanity from the demons; however, Vergil's intention to take Mundus' place triggers a fight between the brothers, with Dante being victorious in the end but sparing Vergil's life. In the downloadable content sequel, Vergil's Downfall, a replica of Dante appears to oppose Vergil in his quest for power and is killed in combat. = Other games = Dante is also a playable character in several games outside the Devil May Cry series. In the Viewtiful Joe series (also created by Hideki Kamiya), he is playable in the PlayStation 2 version of Viewtiful Joe and the PlayStation Portable version of Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble. In both games he talks frequently with Alastor, the embodiment of the identically named sword in Devil May Cry. Dante appears as an enemy and an optional ally in the director's cut version of Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne, titled Maniax. His inclusion was suggested by the Atlus staff, who thought that he would fit the game's plot and convinced Capcom to include him. Dante is replaced by Raidou Kuzunoha the XIV in the Maniax Chronicle edition and by default in the HD Remaster, but is available as paid DLC in the latter version. Morikawa reprises his role as Dante in HD Remaster. There is a Dante character card in SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS. Although he was also intended for inclusion in SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos, he was removed from the game. Dante made his second fighting-game appearance as a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, and is playable in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite which details his fight against a being named Ultron Sigma. As downloadable content in Infinite, Dante's look can be altered to show his DmC appearance. Dante was scheduled to appear in Soulcalibur III, but did not make it into the final game. Dante is a playable character in the tactical role-playing game Project X Zone, with Demitri Maximoff of Darkstalkers as his partner. He returns in the sequel, Project X Zone 2, with Vergil as his partner. Dante is a playable character in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale in his DmC: Devil May Cry persona. The use of his DmC look (instead of his original persona) was criticised by fans, who were advised by SuperBot Entertainment to enjoy the character's gameplay mechanics. Dante also appeared in Capcom's mobile fighting game, Puzzle Fighter, and the card game Teppen. He is also a guest character in Atlus' Shin Megami Tensei: Liberation Dx2 mobile phone game. The character's visual appearance has also been featured as downloadable content in Capcom's Monster Hunter, Sengoku Basara 4 and Street Fighter V. =In other media= He appears in other media based on the video games, including two light novels by Shinya Goikeda. A young Dante, is chased by assassins, and he searches for a demonic statue, known as the Beastheads, in a Devil May Cry 2 prequel. A Devil May Cry 4 novel by Bingo Morihashi reprises Dante's role in the game, revealing his interest in Nero after discovering his resemblance to his brother Vergil. A Devil May Cry 3 manga follows Dante before the game's events; a comic of the first game was published by Dreamwave Productions, and an anime, Devil May Cry: The Animated Series, follows him as he solves cases involving demons while guarding a young girl named Patty Lowell. DmC: Devil May Crys version of Dante appears in the game's prequel comic, The Chronicles of Vergil, when he receives the Rebellion sword to fight demons. The anime inspired two CD dramas whose narrative involves Dante's life. In 2019, Tomio Ogata authored a manga that features Dante's actions in Devil May Cry 5 as he meets V. In the play Sengoku Basara vs. Devil May Cry he was played by Hiroki Suzuki. In the musical Devil May Cry: The Live Hacker, he was portrayed by Ry≈çma Baba. The popularity of the Devil May Cry series led to a line of action figures, produced by Toycom; Kaiyodo produced a similar line for Devil May Cry 2 and a Devil May Cry 3 Dante action figure.  Reception  =Popularity= A jacket based on Dante's from Devil May Cry 5 was used to promote the game. Dante has been popular in gaming. He ranked third in website ScrewAttack's list of the \\"coolest\\" video game characters in 2007. In 2011, readers of Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition voted Dante as the 28th-top video game character of all time. GameDaily called him one of their favourite Capcom characters, ranking him seventh and saying the varied aspects of the character made him an \\"unstoppable force\\". GamesRadar listed Dante as one of the decade's 25 best new characters while also enjoying his rivalry with Vergil. In 2010, he finished 23rd in a Famitsu poll determining Japan's most popular video-game characters. Dante was voted the 13th-best character of the 2000s by Game Informer. GamesRadar said in 2012 that, despite Dante's multiple characterisations, \\"he's a guy who you'll always have a hell of a time playing with.\\" Dante and Trish were included on The Inquirers list of most memorable video-game love teams, with comments focusing on how they join forces to defeat their enemies. Despite finding the initial relationship between Dante and Trish weird due to her physically similarity to Dante's mother, Cheat Code Central liked the development these two characters underwent in the first Devil May Cry game and expected to see more likable relationships in the future of the franchise. In promoting Devil May Cry 5, Capcom produced replicas of the character's jacket as limited editions for Japanese gamers. Dante has also been noted to have sex appeal that attracts gamers of the series. GamesRadar called Dante \\"Mister 2001\\" in their article on the sexiest new characters of the decade; compared with Devil May Cry female characters, he was the \\"hottest\\" of all because of his muscular build, his hair, his fighting abilities and his attitude. La Nueva Espa√±a included the \\"ephebe that exudes testosterone from every pore\\" in their top ten sexiest video-game characters of both genders. Because of the character's popularity and Capcom publishing ports for the series in 2019, multiple gamers speculated about the possible inclusion of him as downloadable content in Nintendo's fighting game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate . Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno talked about the possibility of Dante becoming a guest character. But he noted that it might not be possible since at the time he was he interviewed about it, Devil May Cry had not been released for Nintendo consoles. However, he also noted that Cloud Strife from Final Fantasy VII made it to the game even though the game had not been released for Nintendo's consoles; he hoped Dante would be added to the cast. WhatCulture ranked Dante as the fourth sexiest male video game character of all time. =Critical response= Dante has been well received by gaming journalists. Game Informer called him \\"one of the most bad- ass characters around\\" when he was introduced, citing the contrast between his character and those previously seen in the Resident Evil series. Meristation regarded Dante's design and characterisation provided by Kamiya as one of the biggest reasons for the iconic character's popularity in hack and slash games. Dante's design and personality was praised by some reviewers; IGN described the character as \\"a dark antihero kind of guy even a down-in-the-dumps, disgruntled teenager would love.\\" SNK artist Falcoon called him an anti-hero, comparing him with K' (a character in The King of Fighters series). GameSpy described Dante as \\"awe-inspiring to look at\\", with attire reminiscent of Vincent Price. Game Rant ranked him as the best Capcom character ever, describing him as \\"the complete package one wants in a heroic figure.\\" Empire ranked him 38th on their list of the 50 greatest video-game characters, describing him as \\"surely one of the coolest\\" characters in the history of video gaming. In a feature article, PSU noted even though Dante's appearance had had multiple designs in different games his appealing personality has remained. Because Dante and Vergil are half demon and half human, they were noted to bring in religious overtones, although it was initially subtle. Ninja Theory made a more direct reference to the way religion is portrayed in gaming while showing the parallels between the identical twins. Dante's younger persona in Devil May Cry 3 and the relationships he goes through in the narrative were also given a major focus by reviewers and found to be superior to Kamiya's original take. Dante's dynamic with Nero in the following game garnered positive responses as critics found none of them overshadowed the other even if Dante's fans had to wait for the game's second half to control him while enjoying the older characterisation. Dante has often been compared with Bayonetta title character, especially in his Devil May Cry 4 persona, based on their personalities and actions. Hideki Kamiya of PlatinumGames has said that he was approached about having the Sega character Bayonetta included in this game; he refused, wanting Bayonetta and Dante to meet \\"on his own terms\\". Kamiya came to regret his decision, realising that fans would have enjoyed the interaction between the characters; if there is a Project X Zone 3, he would strongly support Bayonetta's inclusion. He conducted a poll in 2016 to determine the incarnation of Dante fans would most like to see interact with Bayonetta; the most-popular version was the Devil May Cry 4 Dante. Early impressions of Dante's appearance in Devil May Cry 5 trailer were also positive. GameSpot noted how fans enjoyed his role as well as design, while Vg247 found him more of a \\"charmer\\" than in his previous incarnations due to his interactions with other characters. While still finding his character similar to that in previous games, GamesRadar liked Dante's new appearance, his Cavalier weapon and his cocky attitude. Hobby Consolas liked that while Dante retained some of his original skills and weapons, they liked the Cavalier based on how he could wield it in combat. The Guardian highly enjoyed Dante's cocky personality despite him being far older than in previous games. Metro agreed, finding his dynamic with the younger protagonist, Nero, made enjoyable cutscenes whenever they are featured. PC Gamer enjoyed Dante's hat as it provides entertainment in both cutscenes and gameplay. In Japan, there were limited releases of the game that included a jacket based on Dante's. Destructoid enjoyed the impact Vergil has on both Dante and Nero. In the story both his brother and son become far more serious as they take it upon themselves to stop their relative's threat. Despite liking Dante's relationship with Nero to the point of comparing to them as father and son, USGamer found Dante's treatment of the younger demon hunter mean-spirited even though the character later reveals he does not want Nero to face Vergil because of their connection. GamesRadar called Reuben Langdon the character's best voice actor, noting that the other two actors did not fit the character well. Anime News Network agreed, saying that he made the character far more likable in the anime series, despite flaws in the writing. IGN concurred, finding Langdon a better actor than Toshiyuki Morikawa because of his experience with the series. DVD Talk liked the interactions between Dante, Lady and Trish; the reviewer expected more of them in the anime, rather than stories focused on Dante facing enemies. He found Dante appealing in the anime series, based on his personality and actions. According to a FandomPost reviewer, Dante's role in the anime differed from the games in his childish behaviour over food and money; however, he was still \\"a great character\\". Otaku USA said that in the anime Dante remained faithful to his game version in his actions, most notably the gory (but limited) fighting. Dante's characterisation has also been criticised. His cocky attitude was largely absent from Devil May Cry 2, a major criticism of the game. Noting that Dante underwent character arcs in the anime series because of his relationships with other cast members, IGN felt that it differed from his game character. According to UK Anime Network, his personality in the Devil May Cry 3 prequel manga lacked development; he appeared unlikable, and the script gave him strange lines. The character's use of combos in the crossover Marvel vs Capcom 3 was praised by Eurogamer, although the website wondered if he was overpowered. Prima Games ranked his Flaming Sword Strike the 42nd-best technique in gaming, due to its impact on an enemy if the move connects. Both Kotaku and Eurogamer criticised the \\"weird\\" appearance of Dante's face in the fighting game Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite. Dante's inclusion in Nocturne and Project X Zone was met with a good response. GamesRadar listed him as one of the best unlockable characters in gaming while commenting about his inclusion in Viewtiful Joe as being nothing more than a new skin for the title character. =Reaction to the reboot's Dante= Fan reaction to the character's design in the DmC: Devil May Cry reboot was mainly negative. Hideki Kamiya said that it was based on modern, rebellious youth; although he missed the original Dante, he hoped that people would get used to the new version. Dave Riley of Anime News Network compared the reboot's character with the young Dante from Devil May Cry 3, criticising him as a \\"pretty generic adolescent power fantasy\\" (including swearing when he confronts enemies). Reuben Langdon was disappointed with Dante's characterisation in the reboot after having looked forward to it. Writers on several websites criticised the fan base's negative reaction, saying that they were influenced solely by the character's look; his personality was very close to the original Dante. Response in East Asia was also negative. Hideaki Itsuno himself was bothered by Dante's change in the reboot along with the major changes in the game to the point he thought about quitting Capcom. According to Langdon, Itsuno decided to stay at Capcom when he expressed desire to have control over the franchise. 1UP.com praised Ninja Theory for removing some of Dante's old, unappealing characteristics and making him an approachable protagonist for players. It described the reboot as \\"a fresh and imaginative take on Dante\\". According to IGN, the redesigned hero is more relatable for players. Eurogamer also praised Dante's re-design, calling it one of gaming's best reinventions of a character. However, a VideoGamer.com reviewer said that the new Dante lacked some of the original's iconic features. Comparing Dante and Vergil's characterisations in the reboot, Destructoid found Vergil a more entertaining character in spite of gameplay issues. Dustin Chadwell of Gaming Age said that Vergil's gameplay was superior to Dante's, but was confused about his storyline because his survival was not explained. On the other hand, Angelo M. D'Argenio of Cheat Code Central liked Vergil's story and also found his gameplay superior to Dante's. Metro was harsher to Dante's characterisation in DmC, finding him sexist because his treatment of women, mostly in the introduction scenes to the point of calling him a pervert.

To be considered kosher, Sabbath- observant Jews must supervise and sometimes handle the entire winemaking process, from the time the grapes are crushed until the wine is bottled and any ingredients used, including finings, must be kosher.T. Goldberg \\"Picking the perfect Passover wine\\" MSNBC, April 19th, 2004. Wine that is described as \\"kosher for Passover\\" must have been kept free from contact with chametz, examples being grain, bread and dough. When kosher wine is produced, marketed and sold commercially, it would normally have a hechsher (\\"seal of approval\\") of a kosher certification agency, or of an authoritative rabbi who is preferably also a posek (\\"decisor\\" of Jewish law), or be supervised by a beth din (\\"Jewish religious court of law\\"). In recent times, there has been an increased demand for kosher wines and a number of wine producing countries now produce a wide variety of sophisticated kosher wines under strict rabbinical supervision, particularly in Israel, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Chile and Australia. Two of the world's largest producers and importers of kosher wines, Kedem and Manischewitz, are both based in the Northeastern United States. History Ancient Israelite wine press at Migdal HaEmek. The use of wine has a long history in Judaism, dating back to biblical times. Archeological evidence shows that wine was produced throughout ancient Israel. The traditional and religious use of wine continued within the Jewish diaspora community. In the United States, kosher wines came to be associated with sweet Concord wines produced by wineries founded by Jewish immigrants to New York. Beginning in the 1980s, a trend towards producing dry, premium- quality kosher wines began with the revival of the Israeli wine industry. Today kosher wine is produced not only in Israel but throughout the world, including premium wine areas like Napa Valley and the Saint-√âmilion region of Bordeaux.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 383 Oxford University Press 2006 Role of wine in Jewish holidays and rituals Almost all Jewish holidays, especially the Passover Seder where all present drink four cups of wine, on Purim for the festive meal, and on the Shabbat require obligatory blessings (Kiddush) over filled cups of kosher wine that are then drunk. Grape juice is also suitable on these occasions. If no wine or grape juice is present on Shabbat, the blessing over challah suffices. Rabbi in a kosher wine shop in New York City, circa 1942 At Jewish marriages, circumcisions, and at Redemption of First-born ceremonies, the obligatory blessing of Borei Pri HaGafen (\\"Blessed are you O Lord, Who created the fruit of the vine\\") is almost always recited over kosher wine (or grape juice). According to the teachings of the Midrash, the forbidden fruit that Eve ate and which she gave to Adam was the grape from which wine is derived, though others contest this and say that it was in fact a fig.Rashi On Genesis 3:7Rabbi Nehemiah in the Babylonian Talmud Tractate Berachot 40a and Sanhedrin 70b The capacity of wine to cause drunkenness with its consequent loosening of inhibitions is described by the ancient rabbis in Hebrew as nichnas yayin, yatza sod (\\"wine enters, [and one's personal] secret[s] exit\\"), similar to the Latin \\"in vino veritas\\". Another similarly evocative expression relating to wine is: Ein Simcha Ela BeBasar Veyayin‚Äî\\"There is no joy except through meat and wine\\".) Requirements for being kosher Because of wine's special role in many non-Jewish religions, the kashrut laws specify that wine cannot be considered kosher if it might have been used for idolatry. These laws include Yayin Nesekh (), wine that has been poured to an idol, and Stam Yainom, wine that has been touched by someone who believes in idolatry or produced by non- Jews. When kosher wine is yayin mevushal ( ‚Äì \\"cooked\\" or \\"boiled\\"), it becomes unfit for idolatrous use and will keep the status of kosher wine even if subsequently touched by an idolater. While none of the ingredients that make up wine (alcohol, sugars, acidity and phenols) is considered non-kosher, the kashrut laws involving wine are concerned more with who handles the wine and what they use to make it. For wine to be considered kosher, only Sabbath- observant Jews may handle it, from the first time in the process when a liquid portion is separated from solid waste, until the wine is pasteurized or bottles are sealed. Wine that is described as \\"kosher for Passover\\" must have been kept free from contact with chametz and kitnios. This would include grain, bread, and dough as well as legumes and corn derivatives. =Mevushal wines= When kosher wine is mevushal (Hebrew: \\"cooked\\" or \\"boiled\\"), it thereby becomes unfit for idolatrous use and will keep the status of kosher wine even if subsequently touched by an idolater. It is not known whence the ancient Jewish authorities derived this claim; there are no records concerning \\"boiled wine\\" and its fitness for use in the cults of any of the religions of the peoples surrounding ancient Israel. Indeed, in Orthodox Christianity, it is common to add boiling water to the sacramental wine. Another opinion holds that mevushal wine was not included in the rabbinic edict against drinking wine touched by an idolater simply because such wine was uncommon in those times. Mevushal wine is frequently used in kosher restaurants and by kosher caterers so as to allow the wine to be handled by non-Jewish or non-observant waiters. The process of fully boiling a wine kills off most of the fine mold on the grapes, and greatly alters the tannins and flavors of the wine. Therefore, great care is taken to satisfy the legal requirements while exposing the wine to as little heat as necessary. There is significant disagreement between halachic deciders as to the precise temperature a wine must reach to be considered mevushal, ranging from 165¬∞F (74¬∞C) to 194¬∞F (90¬∞C). (At this temperature, the wine is not at a rolling boil, but it is cooking, in the sense that it will evaporate much more quickly than usual.) Cooking at the minimum required temperature reduces some of the damage done to the wine, but still has a substantial effect on quality and aging potential. A process called flash pasteurization rapidly heats the wine to the desired temperature and immediately chills it back to room temperature. This process is said to have a minimal effect on flavor, at least to the casual wine drinker. Irrespective of the method, the pasteurization process must be overseen by mashgichim to ensure the kosher status of the wine. Generally, they will attend the winery to physically tip the fruit into the crush, and operate the pasteurization equipment. Once the wine emerges from the process, it can be handled and aged in the normal fashion. =According to Conservative Judaism= In the 1960s, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards approved a responsum (\\"legal ruling\\") by Rabbi Israel Silverman on this subject. Silverman noted that some classical Jewish authorities believed that Christians are not considered idolaters, and that their products cannot be considered forbidden in this regard. He also noted that most winemaking in the United States is fully automated. Based on 15th‚Äì19th century precedents in the responsa literature, he concluded that wines manufactured by this automated process may not be classified as wine \\"manufactured by gentiles\\", and thus are not prohibited by Jewish law. This responsum makes no attempt to change halakhah in any way, but rather argues that most American wine, made in an automated fashion, is already kosher by traditional halakhic standards. Some criticism was later made against this teshuvah, because (a) some wines are not made by automated processes but rather, at least in some steps, by hand, and (b) on rare occasions non-kosher fining ingredients are used in wine preparation. Silverman later retracted his position. A later responsum on this subject was written by Rabbi Elliot N. Dorff and also accepted by the CJLS.Elliot Dorff, \\"On the Use of All Wines\\" YD 123:1.1985 Dorff noted that not all wines are made by automated processes, and thus the reasoning behind Silverman's responsum was not conclusively reliable in all cases. On the other hand, Dorff points out that even if we can avoid the issue of \\"wine handled by a gentile\\", there is a separate prohibition against wine produced from wineries owned by a gentile, in which case automation is irrelevant, and all non-certified wines are prohibited. Therefore, he explored the possibility to change the halacha, arguing that the prohibition no longer applies. He cites rabbinic thought on Jewish views of Christians, also finding that most poskim refused to consign Christians to the status of idolater. Dorff then critiqued the traditional halakhic argument that avoiding such wine would prevent intermarriage. Dorff asserted, however, that those who were strict about the laws of kashrut were not likely to intermarry, and those that did not follow the laws would not care if a wine has a heksher or not. He also noted that a number of non-kosher ingredients may be used in the manufacturing process, including animal blood. Dorff concluded a number of points including that there is no reason to believe that the production of such wines is conducted as part of pagan (or indeed, any) religious practice. Most wines have no non- kosher ingredients whatsoever. Some wines use a non-kosher ingredient as part of a fining process, but not as an ingredient in the wine as such. Dorff noted that material from this matter is not intended to infiltrate the wine product. The inclusion of any non-kosher ingredient within the wine occurs by accident, and in such minute quantities that the ingredient is nullified. All wines made in the US and Canada may be considered kosher, regardless of whether or not their production is subject to rabbinical supervision. Many foods once considered forbidden if produced by non-Jews (such as wheat and oil products) were eventually declared kosher. Based on the above points, Dorff's responsum extends this same ruling to wine and other grape-products. However, this teshuvah also notes that this is a lenient view. Some Conservative rabbis disagree with it, e.g. Isaac Klein. As such Dorff's teshuvah states that synagogues should hold themselves to a stricter standard so that all in the Jewish community will view the synagogue's kitchen as fully kosher. As such, Conservative synagogues are encouraged to use only wines with a heksher, and preferably wines from Israel. Regional kosher wine consumption Photo of Yarden wine bottle from Israel, 2007 =United States= The United States of America contains roughly 40% of the Jewish population of the world, and most US wine stores, particularly in the Northeast, have a small kosher section. Historically, kosher wine has been associated in the US with the Manischewitz brand, which produce a sweetened wine with a distinctive taste, made of labrusca rather than vitis vinifera grapes. Due to the addition of high- fructose corn syrup, the normal bottlings of Manischewitz are, for Ashkenazi Jews, not kosher during Passover by the rule of kitniyot, and a special bottling is made available. This cultural preference for a distinct, unique variety of wine dates back to Jewish settlements in early US history.

Early years The early life of George Africanus is obscure. Calculating his birth year from his burial certificate, he was probably born in 1763. His obituary in the Nottingham Journal of 30 May 1834 states that he was born in a village in Sierra Leone, which became a British colony in 1787. It is believed that George arrived in England in early 1766. On 31 March 1766, he was baptised George John Scipio Africanus, and described as a negro boy belonging to Benjamin Molineux of Molineux House, in the Collegiate church of St Peter in Wolverhampton. When George was three years old Molineux began educating him. After Benjamin Molineux's death in 1772, his eldest son, George Molineux, inherited the estate and took responsibility for raising and educating the child. Growing up, Africanus probably worked as a servant in the Molineux family household, before becoming apprenticed to be a brass founder. As an adult, Africanus moved to Nottingham, a place familiar to his adopted family. Benjamin Molineux's grandfather, Darcy Molineux (1652‚Äì1716), served as High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 1687, and Deputy Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire between 1698 and 1702. Darcy Molineux raised George Molineux's father John (1685‚Äì1754) in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, before settling in Wolverhampton around 1700. The family Molineux came from Teversal near Mansfield in the county of Nottinghamshire. Africanus may have become interested in Nottingham after visiting on the way home from the funeral. A relative in his adopted family, Sir William Molineux, 6th Baronet of Teversall, died near Mansfield in 1781. Members of the Wolverhampton Molineux family, including Africanus, may have passed through Nottingham town centre, a town of 18,000 people then, full of beautiful open-air gardens and pleasing surroundings. Starting a business Africanus moved to St Peter's Parish, Nottingham, at the age of 21 around 1784. He met a local girl, Esther (sometimes spelled Ester) Shaw, and they were married on 3 August 1788 at St. Peter's Church, Nottingham. Around 1793, they started up an employment agency, Africanus' Register of Servants,Errol I. Mars, \\"George John Scipio Africanus\\", BlackEntrepreneurProfile,com. operating from their home at 28 Chandlers Lane. If the business was not bringing in sufficient income, Africanus may have performed other jobs for support; while their 1788 marriage bond document states that he was a Brass Founder by trade, trade directories of the time list him as a waiter and labourer as well. Following his death in 1834, his wife Esther remained in the house and continued to run the family business. After she died on 12 May 1853, a notice appeared in the Nottingham Review, stating: \\"Yesterday (Thursday), aged 85 years, Mrs. Africanus, for upwards of sixty years proprietor of the Servants' Register Office in Chandlers Lane.\\" If this account is correct, then Ester ran the Servants' Register Office on Chandler‚Äôs lane from at least 1793. Africanus bought 28 Chandlers Lane and adjoining properties in Bluchers Yard for ¬£380 on 24 October 1829. Family life Africanus and his wife had seven children, but only one lived to adulthood. While no descendants carry the Africanus family surname, his bloodline continued for some time. Daughter Hannah married Samuel Cropper (1802‚Äì1886/7), a watch and clock maker, at St. Mary's Church, Nottingham, in 1825. They had three children: Sarah Ann Cropper (1825‚Äì1842), George Africanus Cropper (1838‚Äì1839) and Esther Africanus Cropper (1840‚Äì1911). Granddaughter Esther married Charles Edward Turnbull at St. Mary's Church, Nottingham, on 28 September 1865. They lived at 9 St. Paul's Crescent, St. Pancras, London. Esther died at the age of 69 in Kingston, Surrey. The 1881 census indicates that she had three children: Arthur (aged 14), Fredrick (13), and Margaret Hannah (9). According to the Last Will and Testament of George Africanus,Will of George Africanus of Nottingham, 1833, Nottinghamshire County Council website, Document of the month, July 2006. he was unhappy with Hannah's marriage to Samuel Cropper. Hannah and Samuel Cropper lived apart for years until after the death of George Africanus. The 1841 census shows Hannah and Samuel Cropper living on Chandlers Lane with her 70-year-old mother, Esther, who was still working as proprietress of the register of servants office at the time. Africanus's will also indicates that his granddaughter, Sarah Ann Cropper, was \\"afflicted\\" in some unstated way; she died at the age of 17, so may have had a serious illness. Burial place and legacy Epitaph in St. Mary's Church, Nottingham Len Garrison, director of Afro-Caribbean Family and Friends (AcFF), ensured that Africanus was included in Nottingham Castle's 1993 Black Presence exhibition. It was only in 2003 that, after painstaking research, Africanus's grave was uncovered, despite its worn inscription, in the churchyard of St. Mary's Church, Nottingham. His wife was buried alongside him. Their children are buried in a separate grave nearby. A gravestone bearing an epitaph now reads: In Memory of George Africanus Who died 19 May 1834 Aged 70 years Also Ester Africanus, wife of the above Who died 12 May 1853? Aged 81 years Oh cruel death that separated here A loving father from his daughter dear Also a tender parent in decline of life A loving mother and a careful wife While in this world they did remain Their latter Days were full of pain 200px A memorial green plaque in memory of Africanus, \\"Nottingham's first black entrepreneur\\", was unveiled on St. Mary's churchyard railings in April 2003, and in October 2014 his place of business and residence, formerly 28 Chandlers Lane, was recognised with a blue heritage plaque erected by the Nubian Jak Community Trust.\\"George Africanus Tram unveiled in Nottingham\\", Nottingham News Centre. On 25 March 2007, as part of the events taking place to commemorate the 200th Anniversary of Abolition of Slave Trade Act, an hour-long service was held at St. Mary's Church, High Pavement, Nottingham, at the end of which a new memorial stone was dedicated by religious leaders. The Bishop of Kingston (Jamaica), the Rt Revd Robert Thompson, preached at the service.

Cheese fries or cheesy chips (latter British English) is a dish consisting of french fries covered in cheese, with the possible addition of various other toppings. Cheese fries are generally served as a lunch- or dinner-time meal. They can be found in fast-food locations, diners, and grills around the globe.  Origins  The dish originated in the United States, although its exact birthplace is still widely disputed. Cheese fries have been said to have grown in popularity in the United States after canned cheese products such as Cheez Whiz were introduced in 1952. Don A. Jenkins is said to have invented the chili cheese fry variation, at the age of 16, in Tomball, Texas. Another report claims that a young fry cook named Austin Ruse was the first to serve this dish while working at Dairy Queen in St. Charles, Missouri. Variations =United States= Throughout the Southwest US, cheese fries are often covered in melted cheddar cheese, bacon bits, jalape√±o slices, and chives, and served with ranch dressing. Alternately, they are also served as carne asada fries. In Philadelphia, pizza fries are topped with melted mozzarella and served with pizza sauce on the side, while \\"mega fries\\" are topped with cheddar (or sometimes Cheez Whiz) and mozzarella cheese and bacon, usually served with a side of ranch dressing. In New York City, Long Island, and New Jersey, they are covered with melted American, mozzarella, or Swiss cheese. Disco fries have the addition of brown gravy. In other parts of the US, nacho cheese sauce is often used, especially at snack stands. Chili cheese fries are topped with chili con carne. The cheese is usually either American or cheddar. In Cincinnati, Ohio, they use their own Cincinnati chili for their chili cheese fries at the local chili restaurants. In New Mexico, they use New Mexico chile for their chili cheese fries, often adding chopped lettuce, tomato, and olives as garnish. =Internationally= In Ireland, a variation called \\"taco fries\\" consists of fresh-cut fries covered in taco sauce and shredded cheddar. Piled on top of the cheese are ground beef, tomato, peppers, onions, and various seasonings. Another staple of Irish fast food restaurants, both stand-alone chippers or chains such as Supermac's, is \\"Garlic Cheese Chips\\", which consists of chips covered in garlic sauce and cheese, usually cheddar. In Bulgaria, a common side dish offered in most restaurants consists of French fries, topped with grated or crumbled sirene. In the Netherlands a dish named 'kapsalon' is served as fast food. This consist of fries covered with cheese, salad, and shawarma or doner kebab. It is often consumed with large amounts of garlic sauce or chili sauce. In the United Kingdom, chips and cheese are often served in pubs. Preparation includes the pouring of cheddar sauce over chips or sprinkling cheddar over chips and then putting the dish under a grill. A variation adds beef gravy or curry sauce.

It has views of the Mediterranean Sea. History Thermae was founded in the 5th century BC by the Greeks, as its name imports, as a thermal spa for Selinunte, whose citizens came there to bathe in the sulphurous springs of Mount San Calogero, which rises up behind the town. We have no account of the existence of a town on the site during the period of the independence of Selinunte, though there is little doubt that the thermal waters would always have attracted some population to the spot. Nor even under the Romans did the place attain to anything like the same importance with the northern Thermae; and there is little doubt that Pliny is mistaken in assigning the rank of a colonia to the southern instead of the northern town of the name. Strabo mentions the waters (Strabo, vi. p. 275); and they are again noticed in the Itineraries under the name of Aquae Labodes or Labrodes.Itin. Ant. p. 89; Tabula Peutingeriana The origins of the town's name have been much debated, with Latin \\"ex acqua\\", as a reference to the springs of thermal water of the area, or Arabic \\"Syac\\", meaning bath, and al Saqquah, dating back to the cult of the Syrian god \\"Shai al Quaaum\\", as possibilities. The city walls, the bastions and the Old Castle owe their existence to Roger the Great Count. A royal city which had remained faithful to Manfred of Sicily during the Angevine invasion, by 1268 A.D. it was besieged by Charles I of Anjou and surrendered the following year. After the Sicilian Vespers, it established itself as a free commune. During the Aragonese-Angevine wars it was besieged numerous times, after which the Peralta family took possession of it and obtained by the king of Sicily the right to mint coins. In the following centuries the town was at the center of bloody feuds between rival baronial families (the Luna, of Aragonese origin, and the Perollo, of Norman stock), which nearly halved its population. In 1647 the impoverished town was the seat of an anti-Spanish rebellion. During World War II the Italian Regia Aeronautica (Royal Air Force) had a base near Sciacca. Geography =Overview= The municipality borders Caltabellotta, Menfi, Ribera and Sambuca di Sicilia. =Climate= Sciacca has a Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Csa), with short, mild and moderately rainy winters and long, hot and dry summers. The city receives around 450 millimeters (17.7 inches) of rain per year, experiencing a peak of 72.3 millimeters (2.8 inches) in November and a minimum of 2.5 millimeters (0.1 inch) in July. Main sights Sciacca still retains much of its medieval layout, which divided the town into quarters, each laid out on a strip of rock descending toward the sea. Sciacca has several points of interest, including: *the Cathedral of Maria SS. del Soccorso (12th century, rebuilt in 1685) *the Castle of the Counts Luna. Of the Old Castle scarce remains can be still seen. *Church of Santa Margherita *Chiesa del Carmine *Church of San Michele (1371, rebuilt in the 17th century) *Church of Santa Maria delle Giummare *Palazzo Steripinto *Palazzo Tagliavia (11th century), in Neo-Gothic style *Palazzo Perollo (15th century) Culture Sciacca's festivals include the Carnival, celebrated during the week before the beginning of Lent (February). The highlight of the festival is the parade of bizarre figures mounted on floats, famous throughout Sicily for their gaudy expressions. Sciacca is also the hometown of the Mediterranean Scene. Starting near the turn of the 20th century, a number of residents of the Sciacca area emigrated to the North End of Boston, Mass., where, starting in 1910, around August 15, their descendants, especially those from fishing families, have celebrated the Festival of the Madonna del Soccorso . The local television stations are TRS Tele Radio Sciacca and 'RMK Tele Radio Monte Kronio'. Economy The economy of Sciacca is mainly based on agriculture, fishing and related food processing industry and tourism.

He worked for the UK Ministry of Food, the post-war Allied Commission for Austria, and different food manufacturers. He wrote prolifically and became famous as a TV and radio personality.  Early life and scientific career  Pyke was born at Gloucester Terrace, Paddington, London, the son of Clara Hannah Lewis and Robert Bond Pyke, manager of a wholesale confectionery business. He went to St. Paul's School, Barnes, London, where he found he had a \\"certain bounciness combined with a lack of self-consciousness.\\" He worked briefly for an insurance company before emigrating to Canada to attend Macdonald College, McGill University, Montreal, studying agriculture, gaining a BSc in 1933. During summers there, he worked as a farm labourer. He remained in Canada for seven years. He returned to the UK and in 1934 became chief chemist at Vitamins Ltd., Hammersmith, London. He worked with Professor J.C.Drummond of University College, London on vitamin research. He gained a Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1936. On 23 August 1937 he married Dorothea Mina Vaughan (1907‚Äì86), an accountant. They had a daughter, Bessie, and a son, John.  Wartime scientific career  In 1941 Pyke joined Professor Drummond at the Ministry of Food where Drummond was scientific advisor. They studied the nutritional effects of food restrictions due to wartime shortages. He lectured on practical nutrition for those working in institutions that provided food: these lectures were published by H.M. Stationery Office under the title The Manual of Nutrition (1945) [the revised 12th edition is still in print, published by the Food Standards Agency]. He suggested using excess human blood supplies to make black pudding for the masses, and supported the idea of using rose hip syrup to replace imported orange juice. He was a scientific advisor to the Allied Commission for Austria in 1945‚Äì6, after which he worked as Principal Scientific officer at the Ministry of Food (1946‚Äì48), continuing to work on institutional diets and nutritional education.  Later scientific career  He joined The Distillers Company in 1949 as the deputy manager of the yeast research division at Glenochil Research Station, Clackmannanshire. In 1955 he became manager, retiring in 1973.  Promotion of science  Pyke became chairman of the Nutrition Society (Scotland) (1954‚Äì55), a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1956), council member of the Institute of Biology (1959-62), council member of the Society of Chemical Industry (1967‚Äì69) and president of the Institute of Food Science & Technology (1969‚Äì77). He became a council member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1968, then secretary, and finally chairman in 1973, a position he held until 1977. He claimed that food manufacturers provided a social service and defended them against accusations of providing unhealthy products.  Publications  Pyke wrote dozens of scientific papers and publications on food and nutrition, and their links to technology and social change. A list of his published books is below. * Manual of Nutrition (1947) * Townsman's Food (1952) * Automation: Its Purpose and Future (1957) * Nothing Like Science (1957) * About Chemistry (1959) * Slaves Unaware?: A mid-century View of Applied Science (1959) * Nutrition (Teach Yourself Books) (1961) * The Science Myth (1962) * The Boundaries of Science (1963) * The Science Century (1967) * Food & Society (1968) * The Human Predicament: An anthology with questions by Cedric Blackman (1968) * Man and Food (1970) World University Library * Food Science and Technology (1970) * Synthetic Food (1970) John Murray * Technological Eating: Or, Where does the fish-finger point?

In 1974, he appeared on Yorkshire Television's Don't Ask Me and then Don't Just Sit There (until 1980), in which he and other experts such as David Bellamy, Rob Buckman and Miriam Stoppard fielded popular science questions. His exuberant delivery, with very animated and passionate speech and gesticulation, made him famous. He was a panellist on radio programmes such as Any Questions? and Just a Minute and a guest on Desert Island Discs. He called this period his 'sixth life.' In September 1975, the popular science magazine New Scientist asked its readers to name the best-known and most characteristic scientist. Pyke came third after Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. On 10 December 1975, Pyke was celebrated on This Is Your Life, a Thames Television production for ITV. He won the Pye Colour Television Award for most promising male newcomer to television (1975) and the Multi-Coloured Swap Shop Star Award for expert of the year (1977‚Äì78). = TV appearances = (all as himself unless otherwise indicated) *The Fifty-One Society (1960) *A Suspicion of Poison (1962) *Can Man Be Modified?

In 1978 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.  Retirement  Pyke retired from regular broadcasting in 1980, save for occasional TV appearances. He nursed his wife at home in Hammersmith until her death in 1986. He survived a brutal burglary at his home in 1988 by a thief, leaving him badly injured. He died on 19 October 1992 at Elmsbank Nursing Home, Carlton Drive, Wandsworth, London.

Russell graduated from the university in 1901 and enrolled in the University of Mississippi School of Law. After completing the course, he was admitted to the bar and practiced law in Oxford, Mississippi. Russell was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1907 and to the Mississippi State Senate in 1909. In 1912, he successfully passed a bill prohibiting secret and exclusive societies at the public institutions of higher learning. The law stayed on the books for twelve years. Russell was elected to the office of lieutenant governor in 1915 and elected governor in 1919. His term was marked by crop failures due to the boll weevil. Russell also filed an antitrust suit against several fire insurance companies for their business practices. In 1923, he was sued for seduction and breach of promise by his former secretary Frances Birkhead. Russell was acquitted and he blamed the lawsuit on the fire insurance industry. Russell was unable to run for re-election due to the term limits in the Mississippi constitution at that time. He retired to the Gulf Coast of Mississippi.

He played in New Zealand bands such as The Crocodiles, and formed Australian a cappella groups, the Elevators, the Cafe of the Gate of Salvation, the Honeybees and the Heavenly Lights. Currently he lives in New Zealand and works as a singer, composer, author and workshop leader, in the areas of vocal arranging and gospel music. History Backhouse completed a B.A. (English), and B.Mus. (Composition) at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, under the tutorship of composers David Farquhar and Jenny McLeod. He later completed a graduate course in ethnomusicology (focusing on blues and gospel) at University of Memphis, USA. Backhouse composes and arranges mainly for a cappella choirs, always with an ear to vernacular traditions ‚Äì contemporary funk, African choirs, gospel ‚Äì and to anything polyphonic. Works that typify his style are Jubilation and in the Shadow of Thy Wings, (Caf√© of the Gate of Salvation). Bands In the early seventies, Backhouse composed and performed music for NZ radio, theatre and film, but most of his energies were spent in NZ funk/soul/pop bands, including Mammal, Spats, Rough Justice and the Crocodiles (which won three Recording Industry Awards in 1980). Relocating to Australia in 1981, and following the demise of the Crocodiles, Backhouse formed his own band, Vulgar Beatmen (with ex-Crocodile Jonathan Zwartz and ex- Rough Justice Peter Boyd and Mike Gubb) and sang and/or played guitar with Ren√©e Geyer, Joe Walsh, Jenny Morris, Jackie Orszaszcky and many others. He has arranged and recorded backing vocals for Dave Dobbyn, Tim Finn, Vince Jones, Justine Clarke and the Umbrellas. Backhouse's songs have been recorded by Jenny Morris, Ren√©e Geyer and others, and he has contributed to film soundtracks including Sweetie (Jane Campion), Rodney & Juliet (Fane Flaws) and Braindead (Peter Jackson). A cappella In the mid-eighties Backhouse became fascinated by the Black gospel tradition, and, as a result, increasingly involved in community music, choral directing and running vocal workshops. He founded the a cappella quartet the Elevators, a cappella gospel choirs the Caf√© of the Gate of Salvation and the Honeybees and a cappella quartet the Heavenly Light Quartet. Backhouse has received awards from the Contemporary A Cappella Society of America and composer commissions from The Song Company and the Australia Council. In 1990 he received an Australia Council International Study Grant to research Black gospel traditions at Memphis State University. In 2006, his song Lost in the Heavenly Light was nominated for the Australian Classical Music Awards for Vocal Work of the Year. Since 1987, Backhouse has been running vocal workshops throughout Australia and New Zealand, Canada, the Pacific Islands, France, Italy and the UK, and has been a solo performer at festivals throughout Australia. He has published two African American gospel songbooks 'A cappella ‚Äì Rehearsing For Heaven' (1995; accompanying double CD, 2003) and 'Move on Up' (2005), and a book on directing vocal groups, 'Freeing the song'. His current activities include running workshops in a cappella traditions, composing and arranging for vocal ensembles and choirs, singing with the Heavenly Light Quartet (whenever he gets to Sydney) and recording original music with long-time colleagues Peter Dasent and Fane Flaws under the name Bend. He runs a community gospel choir in Napier, NZ, and plays bass & guitar with Fane Flaws' band No Engine.

During a blitz, a higher than usual number of defensive players will rush the opposing quarterback, to try to tackle the quarterback or force him to hurry his pass attempt. In practice, a blitz involves five or more players rushing during a single down, rather than the four rushers used during normal play. For example, in a defense that normally uses four defensive linemen to rush, a blitz can be created by adding one or more linebackers or defensive backs. Blitzing is a higher-risk strategy, as fewer defensive players are left to cover receivers or to defend against running plays. However, a successful blitz will result in a sack or will force the quarterback into making an error. History The blitz began with the \\"red-dog\\", likely first done by Red Ettinger a linebacker for the University of Kansas, sometime between 1948‚Äì1950.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat;=19791230&id;=zZ8tAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=_6AFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5956,5162639 The term \\"red-dog\\" referred to a rushing linebacker that created a six-on-five matchup against the offensive line; and blitz meant rushing seven, thereby leaving one potential receiver uncovered. The term \\"red-dog\\" is at least as old as 1959.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1133924/2/ Defensive coordinator Chuck Drulis is widely credited with inventing the safety blitz in 1960. Bill Arnsparger is the likely creator of the zone blitz. How blitzing works On passing plays, the offense always has at least five people blocking. From the quarterback's left to right, they are the left tackle, left guard, center, right guard, right tackle. The quarterback will throw the pass, and is not an available blocker. Any other player is available to block, or to be a target for a pass, depending on the play design and modification by the quarterback and center based on what they see the defense doing. A blitzing defender sacks a QB The defense can bring all 11 players to blitz the quarterback. This would leave no one to defend against a pass. So the defense chooses to bring a certain number of players to try to sack the quarterback, and leaves the rest to protect against a pass. For this reason, when defenses want to blitz, they usually rush at least five players. By nature, blitzes are risky endeavors for the defense. Since the defense is taking away coverage defenders to rush the quarterback, this usually means that the secondary can not afford to miss any coverage assignments. The defense does not and cannot cover all offensive players, but rather through the blitz, is proactively involved in pressuring the quarterback‚Äîspecifically, trying to sack him, throw off his timing, or force him to make an error such as an interception or fumble. The most common blitzes are linebacker blitzes. Safety blitzes, in which a safety (usually the free safety) is sent, and corner blitzes, where a cornerback is sent, are less common. Sending a defensive back on a blitz is even riskier than a linebacker blitz, as it removes a primary pass defender from the coverage scheme. The pressure, however, is very severe because a blitz by a defensive back is usually not anticipated by the offensive team's blockers. Defensive shells and techniques Blitzes are usually run from \\"Cover 1\\" coverage shells, which assign one man to guard the entire deep field, though blitzes can be employed in nearly any coverage scheme. Cover 1 is most effective in terms of blitzing because it allows a larger number of defensive players to tighten down on the line of scrimmage, thus increasing the variety of blitzes possible. Since the main goal is to disrupt the offensive play before it even develops, many blitz packages encourage cornerbacks to play tight man bump and run coverage to disrupt the wide receivers' release and prevent them from running their pre- assigned routes. The non-blitzing safety, usually the free safety, has an enormous amount of field to protect and is at a serious disadvantage if the blitz is unsuccessful and receivers threaten his coverage area or if the offense can quickly move the ball forward through immediate checkdown passes or draw plays. As such, he usually works for depth upon the snap of the ball, backpedaling into his assigned zone. Linebackers are either blitzing or in pass coverage. Blitzing linebackers can employ various stunts to confuse the offense's blockers and break down their protection scheme. Coverage linebackers in a Cover 1 scheme will usually have man responsibility on a halfback, fullback, or tight end. Some defensive schemes employ \\"key\\" blitzes where a player will blitz only if his assigned man stays in to block, thus keying his action off the action of his man. If his man releases into a pass pattern, then the defensive player will cover him. For example, if weak side linebacker has the fullback as his man, if upon the snap of the ball the fullback blocks, the linebacker will blitz. Advantages and disadvantages Advantages gained by blitzing are obvious: proactively disrupt the offense's play before it develops and cause enough pressure on the quarterback to force him into a turnover, sack, or incomplete pass. Disadvantages abound in any blitz scheme as well. First, the offensive linemen are usually trained to recognize a blitzing player before the snap of the ball. They communicate with each other at the line of scrimmage using code words that shift the protection to the blitzing player's side, thus strengthening their blocking front. The quarterback can also call other players into the protection scheme with audibles if he feels that his current protection is weak. With good protection calls and fundamental blocking principles, some blitzes can be \\"picked up\\" ‚Äî stopped at the point of attack. Second, the tight man bump and run technique typical of blitz scheme cornerbacks can be defeated with aggressive wide receiver release moves. Once this happens, the cornerback is at a disadvantage and must regain ground and position quickly to prevent a catch. If the blitz is picked up, the wide receiver can create enough separation to become open relatively quickly. Third, if the blitz is picked up, the one deep defender (usually the free safety) has an enormous amount of territory to guard. If two players simultaneously threaten his zone, he must decide which one to cover. The quarterback can read his reaction and throw to the other receiver, usually for a big gain. Fourth, if the pass is caught, there are fewer defenders and larger gaps between defenders, meaning that the receiver can get more yards after catch and possibly turn a minimal gain into a dangerous play.  Playing against the blitz  Offenses employ the above procedures to beat the blitz as well as two other techniques and passing route combinations designed to exploit weaknesses in a blitzing scheme. One of those techniques is called \\"throwing hot,\\" which entails intentionally leaving one blitzing defensive player unblocked. The offensive line usually makes pre-snap adjustments so that the \\"free\\" rusher is clearly within the QB's field of vision. This limits devastating blind-side hits on the QB by rushers. When the preparedness of a quarterback allows him to not have to worry about getting hit from behind, it is one less psychological element of the blitz to be taken away, and thus blitz is incrementally made less effective by that particular element. The other technique, sometimes used in conjunction with throwing hot, is called sight adjustment. Receivers are taught to run into the empty spot vacated by a blitzing player instead of running their pre-assigned pattern. The QB sees the free rusher or blitzing LB/CB and knows that the receiver will sight adjust accordingly and run a route that takes him into the hole left by the defender. The West Coast Offense is an offense that focuses on ball control and short passes. This is a well timed offense where the quarterback throws the ball quickly to avoid the rush, but still allow the wide receiver to get behind the blitzing players. Another method is a trick play, known as an \\"offensive blitz\\", because it is used when the defense blitzes. A quarterback throws a pass to a receiver to draw the remaining defenders to him, because the blitzers will be in the backfield, and the quarterback runs down the other side of the field; the receiver then throws the ball back to the quarterback with a lateral, who then tries to run in for a touchdown. If executed properly, this play can result in large gains and heavily discourage blitzing. Ideally, the blitzing defenders are all in the backfield while the corners are all over the receiver. The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers have run variations of the play successfully in the National Football League playoffs.

Born in Sicily, Castro emigrated to the U.S. in 1919. He never finished high school but went to work as an upholsterer‚Äôs apprentice. In 1931 with $400 in capital he opened his first store, which eventually became a chain he named Castro Convertibles. At his death in 1991, he had sold over 5 million of his convertible sofas through 48 retail showrooms in 12 states, becoming a multimillionaire in the process. In the 1959 novel Epitaph for a Tramp by David Markson, the main character Harry Fannin, in chapter six, says: \\"She was staring at the Castro they‚Äôd squeezed in against a far wall\\", referring to Castro Convertibles. Bernard Castro married Theresa Barabas on Valentine‚Äôs Day 1942. Their two children were Bernard, Jr. and Bernadette. Bernadette became locally famous in the New York area as the company‚Äôs official four-year-old spokesperson. Theresa died at 85 in March 2002.Bonita Banner . Castro Convertibles was acquired in 1993 by Krause Furniture. Bernard was involved with every aspect of the product‚Äôs development, production and sale. Bernard brought the sofa bed into the living room, formerly that category of product was not thought of as a living room piece of furniture. With Bernard‚Äôs interior design background, he was able to introduce a more fashion forward concept for convertible furniture. Bernard was a genius at advertising, using all 3 mediums at once: television, radio, and print in all markets where Castro Convertibles had showrooms. Bernard‚Äôs legacy of innovation was key to the company‚Äôs success. He believed strongly in creating new and inventive products to propel the brand. A favorite innovation includes the ‚ÄòScotch n Sofa,‚Äô a sofa that converted into a bar with a built in turntable, unlike anything else out in the marketplace. Products like this made Castro Convertibles the leader and innovator in convertible furniture. Bernard believed in making his showrooms a destination for customers, with a real ‚Äúshow business‚Äù experience. Bernard built a 35-foot boat in his celebrated Fort Lauderdale showroom, which attracted customers from all over the region. Bernard donated his time and resources generously to a number of causes throughout the course of his life, including the Columbus Citizens Foundation (Bernard was a founding member of the organization), Boys Town of Italy, Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, The American Heart Association and The Royal Dames for Cancer Research. Bernard was a recipient of the coveted The Horatio Alger Award in 1963. The award is given to entrepreneurial and nonprofit leaders who have achieved the American Dream via extraordinary accomplishments. Bernard was also a member of the Knight of Malta and the Knight of Holy Sepulcher. In 2014, Bernard was one of four inductees into The American Furniture Hall of Fame at the Foundation's annual banquet in High Point, North Carolina. Bernard also received a bronze plaque on the Foundation‚Äôs Walk of Fame, and is featured in Foundation's Wall of Fame exhibit, which are both located in Furniture Plaza in High Point. Castro received an Honorary Doctor of Commercial Science Ph.D. from Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, New York in 1974. Bernard was a founding member of the Florida Council of 100 and a member of 23rd Street Association in New York City. Bernard spent many years in Florida and was very active in the Ocala/Marion County Chamber of Commerce and was also a huge supporter of the Florida National Guard. He dedicated several hundred acres of his Ocala land for a Special National Guard Drop Zone and was made an honorary Green Beret and upon his death there was a tribute in the United States Armed Forces publication, Stars and Stripes. Bernadette Castro managed the sale to Krause but retained the large portfolio of commercial real estate her father had acquired, both retail and industrial. Those properties in New York, Florida, Connecticut, and Virginia put the family in the real estate business. The iconic Castro Convertible brand was retired until 2010 when Bernadette Castro and her children bought back the intellectual property and relaunched the business with one of the most popular original products, the Castro Convertible Ottoman. Rather than retail locations, the new Castro is available onlineCastro Convertibles Website. for purchase by both consumers and the lodging and resort industry.

Adherents of the technique claim that these have healing powers, although there is no scientific basis for this claim.Regal, Brian. (2009). Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia. Greenwood. p. 51. In one method, the practitioner places crystals on different parts of the body, often corresponding to chakras; or else the practitioner places crystals around the body in an attempt to construct an energy grid, which is purported to surround the client with healing energy. Despite this, scientific investigations have not validated claims that these \\"energy grids\\" actually exist, nor is there any evidence that crystal healing has any greater effect upon the body than any other placebo; for these reasons it is a pseudoscience. When the practice is popular, it creates commercial demand for crystals, which results in environmental damage and exploitative child labor to mine the crystals. =History= The first historical documentation of crystals originated from the Ancient Sumerians (c. 4500- c. 2000 BC). The Sumerians used crystals in their magical formulas. Ancient Egyptians mined for crystals and used them to make jewelry. Crystals or gemstones were also used in practice, for their metaphysical properties. Specifically, they used crystals as aids for health and protection. They often would bury a Lapis Lazuli scarab with their deceased, with the belief that it would protect them in the Afterlife. The Ancient Greeks assigned a multitude of properties to crystals. The word ‚ÄúCrystal‚Äù is derived from the Greek word ‚Äúkr√Ωstallos‚Äù which translates to ‚Äúice‚Äù. The Ancient Greeks believed that clear quartz crystals were a water that had froze to the point where it‚Äôd remain in its solid form. The word ‚Äúamethyst‚Äù in Ancient Greek language means ‚Äúnot intoxicate.‚Äù Amethyst was worn as an amulet that they believed would aid hangovers or prevent intoxication. Ethnography Precious stones have been thought of as objects that can aid in healing ‚Äî in a practice known as lapidary medicine ‚Äî by a variety of cultures. The Hopi Native Americans of Arizona use quartz crystals to assist in diagnosing illnesses. Both Pliny the Elder and Galen claimed that certain crystals had medicinal properties. In Europe, the belief in the healing powers of crystals (and in particular crystal amulets) persisted in to the Middle Ages.‚ÄúEarly Medieval Crystal Amulets: Secular Instruments of Protection and Healing.‚Äù Medievalists.net, June 29, 2011. http://www.medievalists.net/2011/06/early-medieval-crystal-amulets-secular- instruments-of-protection-and-healing/.‚ÄúSymbolic Virtues of Gems.‚Äù Dress, Jewels, Arms and Coat of Arms: Material Culture and Self-Representation in the Late Middle Ages. Central European University. Accessed September 13, 2019. http://web.ceu.hu/medstud/manual/SRM/symbol.htm. The alleged medicinal properties of precious stones, as well as other powers they were believed to hold, were collected in texts known as Lapidaries, which remained popular in Medieval and Early Modern Europe until the 17th century. In the English speaking world, crystal healing is heavily associated with the New Age spiritual movement: \\"the middle-class New Age healing activity par excellence\\". In contrast with other forms of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), participants in crystal healing view the practice as \\"individuated\\", i.e., dependent on extreme personalization and creative expression. Practitioners of crystal healing purport that certain physical properties‚Äîe.g., shape, color, and markings‚Äîdetermine the ailments that a stone can heal; lists of such links are published in commonly distributed texts. Paradoxically, practitioners also \\"hold the view that crystals have no intrinsic qualities but that, instead, their quality changes according to both\\" participants. After selecting the stones by color or their believed metaphysical qualities, they place them on parts of the body. Color selection and placement of stones are done according to concepts of grounding, chakras, or energy grids. Scientific evaluation There is no peer-reviewed scientific evidence that crystal healing has any effect; it is considered a pseudoscience.Spellman, Frank R; Price-Bayer, Joni. (2010). In Defense of Science: Why Scientific Literacy Matters. The Scarecrow Press. p. 81. \\"There is no scientific evidence that crystal healing has any effect. It has been called a pseudoscience. Pleasant feelings or the apparent successes of crystal healing can be attributed to the placebo effect or cognitive bias‚Äîa believer wanting it to be true.\\" Alleged successes of crystal healing can be attributed to the placebo effect. Furthermore, there is no scientific basis for the concepts of chakras, being \\"blocked\\", energy grids requiring grounding, or other such terms; they are widely understood to be nothing more than terms used by adherents to lend credibility to their practices. Energy, as a scientific term, is a very well-defined concept that is readily measurable and bears little resemblance to the esoteric concept of energy used by proponents of crystal healing. In 1999, researchers French and Williams conducted a study to investigate the power of crystals compared with a placebo. Eighty volunteers were asked to meditate with either a quartz crystal, or a placebo stone which was indistinguishable from quartz. Many of the participants reported feeling typical \\"crystal effects\\"; however, this was irrespective of whether the crystals were real or placebo. In 2001 Christopher French, head of the anomalistic psychology research unit at the University of London and colleagues from Goldsmiths College outlined their study of crystal healing at the British Psychological Society Centenary Annual Conference, concluding: \\"There is no evidence that crystal healing works over and above a placebo effect.‚Äù Crystal healing effects could also be attributed to cognitive bias (which occurs when the believers want the practice to be true and see only things that back up that desire). Crystal healing techniques are also practiced on animals, although some veterinary organizations, such as the British Veterinary Association, have warned that these methods are not scientifically proven and state that people should seek the advice of a vet before using alternative techniques.  Sales and industry  Worldwide, retail sales of crystals amount to more than one billion US dollars per year. India, China, Brazil, and Madagascar are the main producers of crystals. In Madagascar, one of the sources of crystals, most crystals are mined in unsafe, non-industrial or \\"homemade\\" mines, with parents and children working together to dig crystals from pits and tunnels they dig with shovels. The miners are usually paid between 17 and 23 cents per kilogram for rose quartz (less than a penny per ounce). The miner's income may be just 0.1% of the final retail price. Some people in the industry say that the low pay for miners is because customers in developed countries want low retail prices; others say that it is due to shops in developed countries wanting to be more profitable.

He also had a brief career as a racing driver. Early life Reid was born in St. Louis, Missouri, into a showbusiness family. His mother, Bertha Westbrook (1868‚Äì1939), was an actress, and his father, James Halleck \\"Hal\\" Reid (1862‚Äì1920), worked successfully in a variety of theatrical jobs, mainly as playwright and actor, traveling the country. As a boy Wallace Reid was performing on stage at an early age, but acting was put on hold while he obtained an education at Freehold Military School in Freehold Township, New Jersey. He later graduated from Perkiomen Seminary in Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, in 1909. A gifted all-around athlete, Reid participated in a number of sports while also following an interest in music, learning to play the piano, banjo, drums, and violin. As a teenager, he spent time in Wyoming, where he learned to be an outdoorsman. Career Reid was drawn to the burgeoning motion picture industry by his father, who shifted from the theatre to writing films, directing them, and acting in them. In 1910, Reid appeared in his first film, The Phoenix, an adaptation of a Milton Nobles play, filmed at Selig Polyscope Studios in Chicago. Reid used the script from a play his father had written and approached the very successful Vitagraph Studios, hoping to be given the opportunity to direct. Instead, Vitagraph executives capitalized on his sex appeal, and in addition to having him direct, cast him in a major role. Although Reid's good looks and powerful physique made him the perfect \\"matin√©e idol\\", he was equally happy with roles behind the scenes and often worked as a writer, cameraman, and director. Wallace Reid appeared in several films with his father, and as his career in film flourished, he was soon acting and directing with and for early film mogul Allan Dwan. In 1913, while at Universal Pictures, Reid met and married actress Dorothy Davenport (1895‚Äì1977). He was featured as Phil Stoneman in The Birth of a Nation (1915) and The Rhapsode in Intolerance (1916), both directed by D. W. Griffith, and starred opposite leading ladies such as Florence Turner, Gloria Swanson, Lillian Gish, Elsie Ferguson, and Geraldine Farrar en route to becoming one of Hollywood's major heartthrobs. Already involved with the creation of more than 100 motion picture shorts, Reid was signed by producer Jesse L. Lasky and starred in over 60 films for Lasky's Famous Players film company, which later became Paramount Pictures. Frequently paired with actress Ann Little, his action-hero role as the dashing race-car driver drew young girls and older women alike to theaters to see his daredevil auto thrillers such as The Roaring Road (1919), Double Speed (1920), Excuse My Dust (1920), and Too Much Speed (1921). One of his auto-racing films, Across the Continent (1922), was chosen as the opening night film for San Francisco's Castro Theatre, which opened on 22 June 1922. Reid loved racing so much that he even made an (unsuccessful) attempt to qualify for the 1922 Indianapolis 500. Death The urn of Wallace Reid, in the Great Mausoleum, Forest Lawn, Glendale While on route to a location in Oregon during filming of The Valley of the Giants (1919), Reid was injured in a train wreck near Arcata, California and needed six stitches to close a three-inch scalp wound. To keep on filming, he was prescribed morphine for relief of his pain. Reid soon became addicted, but kept on working at a frantic pace in films that were growing more physically demanding and changing from 15‚Äì20 minutes in duration to as much as an hour. Reid's morphine addiction worsened at a time when drug rehabilitation programs were nonexistent, and he died in a sanitarium while attempting recovery.Troping the body: gender, etiquette, and performance By Gwendolyn Audrey Foster. Southern Illinois University Press. p. 108 Wallace Reid was interred in the Azalea Terrace of the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Aftermath His widow, Dorothy Davenport (billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid), co-produced and appeared in Human Wreckage (1923), making a national tour with the film to publicize the dangers of drug addiction. She and Reid had two children: a son, Wallace Reid Jr., born in 1917; and a daughter, Betty Mummert, whom they adopted in 1922 as a three-year-old; allegedly Reid had fathered her during an affair. Reid's widow never remarried. Wallace Reid's contribution to the motion picture industry has been recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Popular culture Reid's name is mentioned by William Holden in Sunset Boulevard, a film in which Gloria Swanson, one of Reid's original co-stars, appears as a forgotten silent film star. In Ken Russell's 1977 film Valentino, Reid is portrayed briefly and inaccurately as a bicycle-riding childish movie star and is made up to look like a cross between the character he played in Clarence, Harold Lloyd, and the comic actors Jimmie Adams and Churchill Ross. In the 1980 documentary Hollywood episode \\"Single Beds and Double Standards\\", Reid's story is recalled by those silent film survivors who worked with him: Gloria Swanson, Karl Brown, Henry Hathaway, and stuntman Bob Rose. In 2007, a biography Wallace Reid: Life and Death of a Hollywood Idol by author E. J. Fleming appeared, the first since his mother's personal recollections after Reid's death. In 2018, a biography of Reid was the subject of Karina Longworth's Podcast \\"You Must Remember This\\". Filmography (see Wallace Reid filmography) References Reid was a favorite of movie-goers. The original caption of this image from Picture-Play Magazine reads, \\"The only reason why they don‚Äôt let Wally play in dress-suit roles all the time is that the casualties among the ladies would soon empty the picture houses.

The film recounts the 1952 expedition, initially by motorcycle, across South America by Guevara and his friend Alberto Granado. As well as being a road movie, the film is a coming-of-age film; as the adventure, initially centered on youthful hedonism, unfolds, Guevara discovers himself transformed by his observations on the life of the impoverished indigenous peasantry. Through the characters they encounter on their continental trek, Guevara and Granado witness first hand the injustices that the destitute face and are exposed to people and social classes they would have never encountered otherwise. To their surprise, the road presents to them both a genuine and captivating picture of Latin American identity. As a result, the trip also plants the initial seed of cognitive dissonance and radicalization within Guevara, who would later view armed revolution as a way to challenge the continent's endemic economic inequalities and political repression. The screenplay is based primarily on Guevara's trip diary of the same name, with additional context supplied by Traveling with Che Guevara: The Making of a Revolutionary by Alberto Granado. Guevara is played by Gael Garc√≠a Bernal (who previously played Che in the 2002 miniseries Fidel), and Granado by the Argentine actor Rodrigo de la Serna, who coincidentally is a second cousin to the real-life Guevara on his maternal side.Durbin, Karen. The New York Times, Arts Section, 12 September 2004. Last accessed: 23 March 2008. Directed by Brazilian director Walter Salles and written by Puerto Rican playwright Jos√© Rivera, the film was an international co-production among production companies from Argentina, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Chile, Peru and France. The film's executive producers were Robert Redford, Paul Webster, and Rebecca Yeldham; the producers were Edgard Tenenbaum, Michael Nozik, and Karen Tenkhoff; and the co-producers were Daniel Burman and Diego Dubcovsky. Plot In 1952, a semester before Ernesto \\"Fuser\\" Guevara is due to complete his medical degree, he and his older friend Alberto Granado, a biochemist, leave Buenos Aires to travel across South America. While there is a goal at the end of their journey - they intend to work in a leper colony in Peru - the main purpose is initially fun and adventure. They desire to see as much of Latin America as they can, more than in just four and a half months, while Granado's purpose is also to bed as many women as will fall for his pickup lines. Their initial method of transport is Granado's dilapidated Norton 500 motorcycle christened La Poderosa (\\"The Mighty One\\"). Their planned route is ambitious, bringing them north across the Andes, along the coast of Chile, through the Atacama Desert and into the Peruvian Amazon in order to reach Venezuela just in time for Granado's 30th birthday on 2 April. However, due to La Poderosa's breakdown, they are forced to travel at a much slower pace, often walking, and don't make it to Caracas until July. During their expedition, Guevara and Granado encounter the poverty of the indigenous peasants, and the movie assumes a greater seriousness once the men gain a better sense of the disparity between the \\"haves\\" (to which they belong) and the obviously exploited \\"have-nots\\" (who make up the majority of those they encounter) by travelling on foot. In Chile, for instance, they encounter a penniless and persecuted couple forced onto the road because of their communist beliefs. In a fire-lit scene, Guevara and Granado ashamedly admit to the couple that they are not out looking for work as well. The duo then accompanies the couple to the Chuquicamata copper mine, where Guevara becomes angry at the treatment of the workers. However, it is a visit to the ancient Incan ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru that solidifies something in Guevara. His musings are then somberly refocused to how an indigenous civilization capable of building such beauty could be destroyed by the creators of the eventual polluted urban decay of nearby Lima.Excerpted Clip of Machu Picchu from the film The Motorcycle Diaries directed by Walter Salles, distributed by Focus Features, 2004 His reflections are interrupted by Granado, who shares with him a dream to peacefully revolutionize and transform modern South America, to which Guevara quickly retorts: \\"A revolution without guns? It will never work.\\" Later, in Peru, they volunteer for three weeks at the San Pablo leper colony. There, Guevara observes both literally and metaphorically the division of society, as the staff live on the north side of a river, separated from the deprived lepers living across the river to the south. To demonstrate his solidarity, and his medical belief that leprosy is not contagious, Guevara refuses to wear rubber gloves during his visit as the head nun requires, choosing instead to shake bare hands and interact normally with the surprised leper patients. At the end of the film, after his sojourn at the leper colony, Guevara confirms his nascent egalitarian, revolutionary impulses, while making a birthday toast, which is also his first political speech. In it, he invokes a pan-Latin American identity that transcends the arbitrary boundaries of both nation and race. These encounters with social injustice transform the way Guevara sees the world and his purposes in it, and by implication motivates his later political activities as a Marxist revolutionary. Guevara makes his symbolic \\"final journey\\" at night when, despite the danger and his asthma, he swims across the river that separates the two societies of the leper colony, to spend the night in a leper shack, instead of in the doctors' cabins. Later, as they bid each other farewell at an airport, Granado reveals that his birthday was not 2 April, but rather 8 August, and that the aforementioned goal was simply a motivator: Guevara replies that he knew all along. The film closes with an appearance by the real 82-year-old Alberto Granado, along with pictures from the actual journey and a brief mention of Che Guevara's eventual 1967 CIA-assisted execution in the Bolivian jungle.

The film later screened at many other film festivals, including: the Auckland International Film Festival, New Zealand; the Copenhagen International Film Festival, Denmark; the Espoo Film Festival, Finland; the Telluride Film Festival, United States; the Toronto International Film Festival, Canada; the Vancouver International Film Festival, Canada; the Celebrating Literature in Cinema Film Festival Frankfurt, Germany; the Morelia Film Festival, Mexico; and others. ;Release dates * United States: 15 January 2004 (premiere at Sundance Film Festival) * France: 7 July 2004 * Argentina: 29 July 2004 * United Kingdom: 27 August 2004 * United States: 24 September 2004 * Chile: 21 October 2004 * Germany: 28 October 2004 Critical reception The Motorcycle Diaries was released to very positive reviews by critics, and received a standing ovation at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival.Sundance Flips for Che Guevara By Roger Friedman, 19 January 2004, Fox News The New York Times film critic, A.O. Scott, wrote that \\"in Mr Salles's hands what might have been a schematic story of political awakening becomes a lyrical exploration of the sensations and perceptions from which a political understanding of the world emerges.\\"Scott A.O. The New York Times, film review, 24 September 2004. Gregory Weinkauf of the Dallas Observer espoused that the film \\"delivers as both biography and road movie, and proves itself a deceptively humble epic, an illuminating part of the Che legacy.\\"\\"The Importance of Being Ernesto\\", By Gregory Weinkauf, 30 September 2004, Dallas Observer Claudia Puig of USA Today postulated that \\"the movie achieves an impressive blend of emotional resonance and light entertainment\\" while describing it as \\"more coming-of-age story than biopic\\" and \\"a transformative adventure well worth watching.\\"\\"Guevara's life takes shape in 'Diaries\\", By Claudia Puig, USA TODAY, Sept 27 2004 Keri Petersen of The Gainesville Sun referred to the film as \\"a gorgeous, poetic adventure.\\"10 Foreign Films that make you Forget they have Subtitles by Keri Petersen, The Gainesville Sun, 23 July 2010 Paula Nechak of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer praised director Salles by remarking that he \\"presents the evolutionary course of a young man who coincidentally became the dorm-room poster boy for an idealistic generation, and captures the lovely, heart-and-eye-opening ode to youthful possibility with affection and compassion.\\"\\"Motorcycle Diaries': On the road with a young Che\\", by Paula Nechako, 1 October 2004, Seattle Post- Intelligencer While Washington Post critic Desson Thomson lent praise for the film's starring actor by observing that \\"what Bernal and this well-wrought movie conveys so well is the charisma that would soon become a part of human history, and yes, T-shirts.\\"\\"Viva Che!\\", By Desson Thomson, Washington Post, 1 October 2004 Among the film's few detractors was Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who described the film's positive reviews as \\"a matter of political correctness, I think; it is uncool to be against Che Guevara.\\" Ebert also criticized the film's characterization: \\"seen simply as a film, The Motorcycle Diaries is attenuated and tedious. We understand that Ernesto and Alberto are friends, but that's about all we find out about them; they develop none of the complexities of other on-the-road couples... Nothing is startling or poetic.\\"Ebert, Roger. Chicago Sun-Times, film review, 1 October 2004. Jessica Winter of The Village Voice also criticized the film's simplistic representation of the peasantry, describing \\"the young men's encounters with conscience-pricking, generically noble locals\\" who are occasionally assembled \\"to face the camera in a still life of heroic, art-directed suffering\\".Jessica Winter, 'Child of the Revolution', The Village Voice, 14 September 2004. The film also received criticism for its positive representation of Guevara as a youthful idealist. Anthony Daniels, an outspoken critic of Guevara's, argued that the film helps to continue his wrongful glorification, noting \\"The film is thus the cinematic equivalent of the Che Guevara T-shirt; it is morally monstrous and emotionally trivial.\\" While Frans Weiser agreed, saying that the film's narrative is dominated by reductive images of Guevara as an idealistic, loveable rogue. Online review aggregator Metacritic gives the film a score of 75 out of 100 based on 37 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Meanwhile, Rotten Tomatoes records an 83% approval rating based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Motorcycle Diaries is heartfelt and profound in its rendering of the formative experiences that turn Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara into a famous revolutionary.\\" Furthermore, British historian Alex von Tunzelmann, who reviews films at The Guardian for historical accuracy, graded the film an A- in \\"History\\", while giving the film a B in \\"Entertainment\\".The Motorcycle Diaries: Che's Clean Getaway by Alex von Tunzelmann, The Guardian, 14 April 2011 After comparing scenes from the film to the actual diaries, Tunzelmann posited that \\"The Motorcycle Diaries gets a lot right, it's an entertaining and accurate portrayal of the formative youth of a revolutionary icon.\\" Awards won * Cannes Film Festival: Fran√ßois Chalais Award, Walter Salles; Prize of the Ecumenical Jury, Walter Salles; Technical Grand Prize, Eric Gautier; 2004.Cannes Film Festival awards.

He is one of the few New Zealand musicians who has performed both rock and dance music. He is the cousin of fellow New Zealand singer Margaret Urlichhttps://www.audioculture.co.nz/people/margaret-urlich. Early years Urlich was educated at Sacred Heart College in the suburb of Glen Innes, Auckland. At school in the early 1970s he was in a band called Chillum with his school friend, Ian Morris, and Glendowie College boys Andrew Bayliss, Glenn Owen and Bruce Murdoch. They played local parties, tennis clubs, rugby clubs and school dances. Th' Dudes When Chillum folded in 1975, he and Dobbyn formed Th' Dudes with Ian Morris. After Th' Dudes split in 1980, Urlich headed off to the UK where he was fascinated by the rise of club culture. Returning to New Zealand in 1981, he approached writer Mark Phillips and they opened their first club in a run down bar in Auckland's Albert Street. A Certain Bar was an immediate success and over the next decade, he and Phillips ran a succession of successful clubs. These were hugely influential in establishing a contemporary club scene in Auckland. In 1986 Urlich and Phillips were partners in Stimulant Records with Simon Grigg. The label released the album Eight Arms to Hold You, the first New Zealand club music collection. 1990s In the 1990s Urlich returned to performing and had residencies in Auckland as the vocalist with The Lawrence Quintet. In 1995 he began a Saturday morning radio show on 95bFm. His initial partner was DJ Phil Clark, however he was replaced in 1996 by Bevan Keys and the show, Nice'n'Urlich, with its mix of Urlich's chat and Key's soulful house music selection, became a hit. Taking the show to clubs also proved hugely popular and for the next decade Nice'n'Urlich sold out increasingly larger venues. In 1999 the duo were signed to Simon Grigg's Huh Records. The three Nice'n'Urlich albums sold over 60,000 albums in New Zealand. In 1999 Urlich co-starred in a New Zealand reality show, Popstars (arguably the inspiration for the worldwide Idol phenomenon), which was a hunt for people to form a pop band, and to perform and produce an album (the winners formed a band named TrueBliss). His role in the show was that of manager. 2000s In 2000 Urlich and Grigg released the first of their Room Service compilations of lounge music, once again for Huh. The three volumes sold in excess of 150,000 across Australia and New Zealand. The Room Service brand was also used on a '70s soul collection, Soul Food, which went gold in 2003. The pair also compiled Welcome To, a collection of original New Zealand house music in 2001. In 2002 Urlich launched The P.U.B.E. (Peter Urlich Breakfast Experience) on Auckland station George FM. In 2008 he appeared on New Zealand TV shows Dancing with the Stars and Pop's Ultimate Star. His album of covers of lounge classics, Between You & Me, was released by Liberation Music, in May 2008. Urlich has been the music director of the Taste of Auckland Festival since 2009. Urlich hosted Nice ‚Äòn‚Äô Urlich Saturday mornings on Auckland station George FM, before leaving to establish The P.U.B.E. radio station exclusively on the Radio Schmadio mobile app. He is also the manager of the Pt Chev Pirates, a club in Auckland Rugby League's Phelan Shield.

Biography Faucher was born at Limoges, Haute-Vienne. When he was nine years old the family moved to Toulouse, where the boy was sent to school. His parents were separated in 1816, and L√©on Faucher, who resisted his father's attempts to put him to a trade, helped to support himself and his mother during the rest of his school career by designing embroidery and needlework. As a private tutor in Paris he continued his studies in the direction of archaeology and history, but with the revolution of 1830 he was drawn into active political journalism on the Liberal side. He was on the staff of the Temps from 1830 to 1833, when he became editor of the Constitutionnel for a short time. A Sunday journal of his own, Le Bien public, proved a disastrous financial failure; and his political independence having caused his retirement from the Constitutionnel, he joined in 1834 Le Courrier fran√ßais, of which he was editor from 1839 until 1842, when the paper changed hands. Caricature of L√©on Faucher, French politician and economist Faucher was an early member of the Soci√©t√© d'√©conomie politique organized in 1842 by Pellegrino Rossi. Faucher belonged in policy to the dynastic Left, and consistently preached moderation to the more ardent Liberals. On resigning his connection with the Courrier fran√ßais he gave his attention chiefly to many economic questions. He advocated a customs union between the Latin countries to counterbalance the German Zollverein, and in view of the impracticability of such a measure narrowed his proposal in 1842 to a customs union between France and Belgium. In 1843 he visited England to study the English social system, publishing the results of his investigations in a famous series of Etudes sur l'Angleterre (2 vols., 1845), published originally in the Revue des deux mondes. He helped to organize the Bordeaux association for free-trade propaganda, and it was as an advocate of free trade that he was elected in 1847 to the chamber of deputies for Reims. After the revolution of 1848 he entered the Constituent Assembly for the department of Marne, where he opposed many Republican measures ‚Äì the limitation of the hours of labour, the creation of the national relief works in Paris, the abolition of the death penalty and others. Under the presidency of Louis Napoleon he became minister of public works, and then minister of the interior, but his action in seeking to influence the coming elections by a circular letter addressed to the prefects was censured by the Constituent Assembly, and he was compelled to resign office on 14 May 1849. In 1851 he was again minister of the interior until Napoleon declared his intention of resorting to universal suffrage. After the coup d'√©tat of December he refused a seat in the consultative commission instituted by Napoleon. He had been elected a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Science in 1849, and his retirement from politics permitted a return to his writings on economics. He had been to Italy in search of health in 1854, and was returning to Paris on business when he was seized by typhoid at Marseilles, where he died. Works His miscellaneous writings were collected (2 vols., 1856) as M√©langes d'economie politique et de finance, and his speeches in the legislature are printed in vol. ii. of ' (2 vols., 2nd ed., Paris, 1875).

With better understanding of seismic demand on structures and with our recent experiences with large earthquakes near urban centers, the need of seismic retrofitting is well acknowledged. Prior to the introduction of modern seismic codes in the late 1960s for developed countries (US, Japan etc.) and late 1970s for many other parts of the world (Turkey, China etc.),NZSEE Bulletin 39(2)-June 2006 many structures were designed without adequate detailing and reinforcement for seismic protection. In view of the imminent problem, various research work has been carried out. State-of-the-art technical guidelines for seismic assessment, retrofit and rehabilitation have been published around the world ‚Äì such as the ASCE-SEI 41ASCE-SEI 41 and the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering (NZSEE)'s guidelines.NZSEE 2006 These codes must be regularly updated; the 1994 Northridge earthquake brought to light the brittleness of welded steel frames, for example. The retrofit techniques outlined here are also applicable for other natural hazards such as tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and severe winds from thunderstorms. Whilst current practice of seismic retrofitting is predominantly concerned with structural improvements to reduce the seismic hazard of using the structures, it is similarly essential to reduce the hazards and losses from non-structural elements. It is also important to keep in mind that there is no such thing as an earthquake-proof structure, although seismic performance can be greatly enhanced through proper initial design or subsequent modifications. Infill shear trusses ‚Äî University of California dormitory, Berkeley External bracing of an existing reinforced concrete parking garage (Berkeley) Port Authority Bus Terminal Strategies Seismic retrofit (or rehabilitation) strategies have been developed in the past few decades following the introduction of new seismic provisions and the availability of advanced materials (e.g. fiber- reinforced polymers (FRP), fiber reinforced concrete and high strength steel). Moehle, J. (2000) State of Research on Seismic Retrofit.strategies are different from retrofit techniques, where the former is the basic approach to achieve an overall retrofit performance objective, such as increasing strength, increasing deformability, reducing deformation demands while the latter is the technical methods to achieve that strategy, for example FRP jacketing. *Increasing the global capacity (strengthening). This is typically done by the addition of cross braces or new structural walls. *Reduction of the seismic demand by means of supplementary damping and/or use of base isolation systems.Filiatrault & Cherry (1986) *Increasing the local capacity of structural elements. This strategy recognises the inherent capacity within the existing structures, and therefore adopts a more cost-effective approach to selectively upgrade local capacity (deformation/ductility, strength or stiffness) of individual structural components. *Selective weakening retrofit. This is a counter-intuitive strategy to change the inelastic mechanism of the structure, while recognising the inherent capacity of the structure.e.g. Kam & Pampanin (2008)- Selective weakening retrofit for RC frames *Allowing sliding connections such as passageway bridges to accommodate additional movement between seismically independent structures. *Addition of seismic friction dampers to simultaneously add damping and a selectable amount of additional stiffness. Recently more holistic approaches to building retrofitting are being explored, including combined seismic and energy retrofitting. Such combined strategies aim to exploit cost savings by applying energy retrofitting and seismic strengthening interventions at once, hence improving the seismic and thermal performance of buildings. Performance objectives In the past, seismic retrofit was primarily applied to achieve public safety, with engineering solutions limited by economic and political considerations. However, with the development of Performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE), several levels of performance objectives are gradually recognised: *Public safety only. The goal is to protect human life, ensuring that the structure will not collapse upon its occupants or passersby, and that the structure can be safely exited. Under severe seismic conditions the structure may be a total economic write-off, requiring tear-down and replacement. *Structure survivability. The goal is that the structure, while remaining safe for exit, may require extensive repair (but not replacement) before it is generally useful or considered safe for occupation. This is typically the lowest level of retrofit applied to bridges. *Structure functionality. Primary structure undamaged and the structure is undiminished in utility for its primary application. A high level of retrofit, this ensures that any required repairs are only \\"cosmetic\\" ‚Äì for example, minor cracks in plaster, drywall and stucco. This is the minimum acceptable level of retrofit for hospitals. *Structure unaffected. This level of retrofit is preferred for historic structures of high cultural significance. Techniques Common seismic retrofitting techniques fall into several categories: One of many \\"earthquake bolts\\" found throughout period houses in the city of Charleston subsequent to the Charleston earthquake of 1886. They could be tightened and loosened to support the house without having to otherwise demolish the house due to instability. The bolts were directly loosely connected to the supporting frame of the house. =External post-tensioning= The use of external post- tensioning for new structural systems have been developed in the past decade. Under the PRESS (Precast Seismic Structural Systems),1994 Building Publications ‚Äì Status of the U.S. Precast Seismic Structural Systems (PRESSS) Program a large-scale U.S./Japan joint research program, unbonded post- tensioning high strength steel tendons have been used to achieve a moment- resisting system that has self-centering capacity. An extension of the same idea for seismic retrofitting has been experimentally tested for seismic retrofit of California bridges under a Caltrans research project Lowes & Moehle (1998) ‚Äì ACI Structural Journal Vol 96(4) ‚Äì pp 519‚Äì532 and for seismic retrofit of non-ductile reinforced concrete frames.Experimental testing of external post-tensioning for retrofit of RC beam-column joint Pre-stressing can increase the capacity of structural elements such as beam, column and beam-column joints. External pre-stressing has been used for structural upgrade for gravity/live loading since the 1970s.VSL Repair/Strengthening Page =Base isolators= Base isolation is a collection of structural elements of a building that should substantially decouple the building's structure from the shaking ground thus protecting the building's integrity and enhancing its seismic performance. This earthquake engineering technology, which is a kind of seismic vibration control, can be applied both to a newly designed building and to seismic upgrading of existing structures.Clark Construction Group, LLC Projects Normally, excavations are made around the building and the building is separated from the foundations. Steel or reinforced concrete beams replace the connections to the foundations, while under these, the isolating pads, or base isolators, replace the material removed. While the base isolation tends to restrict transmission of the ground motion to the building, it also keeps the building positioned properly over the foundation. Careful attention to detail is required where the building interfaces with the ground, especially at entrances, stairways and ramps, to ensure sufficient relative motion of those structural elements. =Supplementary dampers= Supplementary dampers absorb the energy of motion and convert it to heat, thus \\"damping\\" resonant effects in structures that are rigidly attached to the ground. In addition to adding energy dissipation capacity to the structure, supplementary damping can reduce the displacement and acceleration demand within the structures. In some cases, the threat of damage does not come from the initial shock itself, but rather from the periodic resonant motion of the structure that repeated ground motion induces. In the practical sense, supplementary dampers act similarly to Shock absorbers used in automotive suspensions. =Tuned mass dampers= Tuned mass dampers (TMD) employ movable weights on some sort of springs. These are typically employed to reduce wind sway in very tall, light buildings. Similar designs may be employed to impart earthquake resistance in eight to ten story buildings that are prone to destructive earthquake induced resonances.Slide 2 =Slosh tank= A slosh tank is a large container of low viscosity fluid (usually water) that may be placed at locations in a structure where lateral swaying motions are significant, such as the roof, and tuned to counter the local resonant dynamic motion. During a seismic (or wind) event the fluid in the tank will slosh back and forth with the fluid motion usually directed and controlled by internal baffles ‚Äì partitions that prevent the tank itself becoming resonant with the structure, see Slosh dynamics. The net dynamic response of the overall structure is reduced due to both the counteracting movement of mass, as well as energy dissipation or vibration damping which occurs when the fluid's kinetic energy is converted to heat by the baffles. Generally the temperature rise in the system will be minimal and is passively cooled by the surrounding air. One Rincon Hill in San Francisco is a skyscraper with a rooftop slosh tank which was designed primarily to reduce the magnitude of lateral swaying motion from wind. A slosh tank is a passive tuned mass damper. In order to be effective the mass of the liquid is usually on the order of 1% to 5% of the mass it is counteracting, and often this requires a significant volume of liquid. In some cases these systems are designed to double as emergency water cisterns for fire suppression. =Active control system= Very tall buildings (\\"skyscrapers\\"), when built using modern lightweight materials, might sway uncomfortably (but not dangerously) in certain wind conditions. A solution to this problem is to include at some upper story a large mass, constrained, but free to move within a limited range, and moving on some sort of bearing system such as an air cushion or hydraulic film. Hydraulic pistons, powered by electric pumps and accumulators, are actively driven to counter the wind forces and natural resonances. These may also, if properly designed, be effective in controlling excessive motion ‚Äì with or without applied power ‚Äì in an earthquake. In general, though, modern steel frame high rise buildings are not as subject to dangerous motion as are medium rise (eight to ten story) buildings, as the resonant period of a tall and massive building is longer than the approximately one second shocks applied by an earthquake. =Adhoc addition of structural support/reinforcement= The most common form of seismic retrofit to lower buildings is adding strength to the existing structure to resist seismic forces. The strengthening may be limited to connections between existing building elements or it may involve adding primary resisting elements such as walls or frames, particularly in the lower stories. Common retrofit measures for unreinforced masonry buildings in the Western United States include the addition of steel frames, the addition of reinforced concrete walls, and in some cases, the addition of base isolation. Connections between buildings and their expansion additions  Frequently, building additions will not be strongly connected to the existing structure, but simply placed adjacent to it, with only minor continuity in flooring, siding, and roofing. As a result, the addition may have a different resonant period than the original structure, and they may easily detach from one another. The relative motion will then cause the two parts to collide, causing severe structural damage. Seismic modification will either tie the two building components rigidly together so that they behave as a single mass or it will employ dampers to expend the energy from relative motion, with appropriate allowance for this motion, such as increased spacing and sliding bridges between sections.  Exterior reinforcement of building  Exterior concrete columns Historic buildings, made of unreinforced masonry, may have culturally important interior detailing or murals that should not be disturbed. In this case, the solution may be to add a number of steel, reinforced concrete, or poststressed concrete columns to the exterior. Careful attention must be paid to the connections with other members such as footings, top plates, and roof trusses. Infill shear trusses Shown here is an exterior shear reinforcement of a conventional reinforced concrete dormitory building. In this case, there was sufficient vertical strength in the building columns and sufficient shear strength in the lower stories that only limited shear reinforcement was required to make it earthquake resistant for this location near the Hayward fault. Massive exterior structure In other circumstances, far greater reinforcement is required. In the structure shown at right ‚Äî a parking garage over shops ‚Äî the placement, detailing, and painting of the reinforcement becomes itself an architectural embellishment. Typical Retrofit Scenario & Solution =Soft-story failure= Partial failure due to inadequate shear structure at garage level. Damage in San Francisco due to the Loma Prieta event. This collapse mode is known as soft story collapse. In many buildings the ground level is designed for different uses than the upper levels. Low rise residential structures may be built over a parking garage which have large doors on one side. Hotels may have a tall ground floor to allow for a grand entrance or ballrooms. Office buildings may have retail stores on the ground floor with continuous display windows. Traditional seismic design assumes that the lower stories of a building are stronger than the upper stories; where this is not the case‚Äîif the lower story is less strong than the upper structure‚Äîthe structure will not respond to earthquakes in the expected fashion. Using modern design methods, it is possible to take a weak lower story into account. Several failures of this type in one large apartment complex caused most of the fatalities in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Typically, where this type of problem is found, the weak story is reinforced to make it stronger than the floors above by adding shear walls or moment frames. Moment frames consisting of inverted U bents are useful in preserving lower story garage access, while a lower cost solution may be to use shear walls or trusses in several locations, which partially reduce the usefulness for automobile parking but still allow the space to be used for other storage. =Beam-column joint connections= Corner joint steel reinforcement and high tensile strength rods with grouted anti-burst jacket below Beam-column joint connections are a common structural weakness in dealing with seismic retrofitting. Prior to the introduction of modern seismic codes in early 1970s, beam-column joints were typically non-engineered or designed. Laboratory testings have confirmed the seismic vulnerability of these poorly detailed and under-designed connections.Beres, A., Pessiki, S., White, R., and Gergely, P. (1996).Implications of experimental on the seismic behaviour of gravity load designed RC beam-column connections. Earthquake Spectra, 12(2), 185‚Äì198.Calvi, G. M., Moratti, M., and Pampanin, S.

A Summary of Result of Simulated Seismic Load Tests on Reinforced Concrete Beam-Column Joints, Beams and Columns with Substandard Reinforcing Details. Journal of Earthquake Engineering, 6(2), 147‚Äì174. Failure of beam-column joint connections can typically lead to catastrophic collapse of a frame-building, as often observed in recent earthquakesPark R, Billings IJ, Clifton GC, Cousins J, Filiatrault A, Jennings DN, et al. The Hyogo-ken Nanbu Earthquake of 17 January 1995. Bull of New Zealand Soc of earthquake Eng. 1995;28(1):1 -99.Holmes WT, Somers P. Northridge earthquake Reconnaissance Report. Supplement C, vol. 2. earthquake Spectra. 1996(11):1‚Äì278. For reinforced concrete beam-column joints ‚Äì various retrofit solutions have been proposed and tested in the past 20 years. Philosophically, the various seismic retrofit strategies discussed above can be implemented for reinforced concrete joints. Concrete or steel jacketing have been a popular retrofit technique until the advent of composite materials such as Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP). Composite materials such as carbon FRP and aramic FRP have been extensively tested for use in seismic retrofit with some success.Pampanin, S., Bolognini, D., Pavese, A. (2007) Performance-based Seismic Retrofit Strategy for Existing Reinforced Concrete Frame Systems using FRP composites. ASCE Journal of Composites for Construction, 11(2), pp. 211‚Äì226. A.

Said 2001 Seismic rehabilitation of beam- column joints using FRP laminates. Journal of Earthquake Engineering, Vol. 5, No. 1, pp. 113‚Äì129. One novel technique includes the use of selective weakening of the beam and added external post-tensioning to the jointSelective weakening and post-tensioning for seismic retrofit of RC beam-column joint in order to achieve flexural hinging in the beam, which is more desirable in terms of seismic design. Widespread weld failures at beam-column joints of low-to-medium rise steel buildings during the Northridge 1994 earthquake for example, have shown the structural defiencies of these 'modern-designed' post-1970s welded moment-resisting connections.Bertero VV, Anderson JC & Krawinkler H. Performance of steel building structures during the Northridge earthquake. Report No UCB/EERC-94/09. Berkeley, California: Earthquake Engineering Research Center, University of California at Berkeley. 1994. A subsequent SAC research project has documented, tested and proposed several retrofit solutions for these welded steel moment-resisting connections. Various retrofit solutions have been developed for these welded joints ‚Äì such as a) weld strengthening and b) addition of steel haunch or 'dog-bone' shape flange.Civjan SA, Engelhardt MD and Gross JD (2000). Retrofit of pre- Northridge Moment Resisting Connections. ASCE J.o.Structural Engineering Vol 126(4) 445‚Äì452 Following the Northridge earthquake, a number of steel moment -frame buildings were found to have experienced brittle fractures of beam to column connections. Discovery of these unanticipated brittle fractures of framing connections was alarming to engineers and the building industry. Starting in the 1960s, engineers began to regard welded steel moment-frame buildings as being among the most ductile systems contained in the building code. Many engineers believed that steel moment-frame buildings were essentially invulnerable to earthquake induced damage and thought that should damage occur, it would be limited to ductile yielding of members and connections. Observation of damage sustained by buildings in the 1994 Northridge earthquake indicated that contrary to the intended behavior, in many cases, brittle fractures initiated within the connections at very low levels of plastic demand. In September, 1994, The SAC joint Venture, AISC, AISI, and NIST jointly convened an international workshop in Los Angeles to coordinate the efforts of various participants and to lay the foundation for systematic investigation and resolution of the problem. In September 1995 the SAC Joint Venture entered into a contractual agreement with FEMA to conduct Phase II of the SAC Steel project. Under Phase II, SAC continued its extensive problem-focused study of the performance of moment resisting steel frames and connections of various configurations, with the ultimate goal of developing seismic design criteria for steel construction. As a result of these studies it is now known that the typical moment-resisting connection detail employed in steel moment frame construction prior to the 1994 Northridge earthquake had a number of features that rendered it inherently susceptible to brittle fracture.FEMA 350, July 2000. Recommended Seismic Design Criteria for New Steel Moment-Frame Buildings.1.3, pages 1‚Äì3 through 1‚Äì11. =Shear failure within floor diaphragm= Floors in wooden buildings are usually constructed upon relatively deep spans of wood, called joists, covered with a diagonal wood planking or plywood to form a subfloor upon which the finish floor surface is laid. In many structures these are all aligned in the same direction. To prevent the beams from tipping over onto their side, blocking is used at each end, and for additional stiffness, blocking or diagonal wood or metal bracing may be placed between beams at one or more points in their spans. At the outer edge it is typical to use a single depth of blocking and a perimeter beam overall. If the blocking or nailing is inadequate, each beam can be laid flat by the shear forces applied to the building. In this position they lack most of their original strength and the structure may further collapse. As part of a retrofit the blocking may be doubled, especially at the outer edges of the building. It may be appropriate to add additional nails between the sill plate of the perimeter wall erected upon the floor diaphragm, although this will require exposing the sill plate by removing interior plaster or exterior siding. As the sill plate may be quite old and dry and substantial nails must be used, it may be necessary to pre-drill a hole for the nail in the old wood to avoid splitting. When the wall is opened for this purpose it may also be appropriate to tie vertical wall elements into the foundation using specialty connectors and bolts glued with epoxy cement into holes drilled in the foundation. =Sliding off foundation and \\"cripple wall\\" failure= House slid off of foundation Low cripple wall collapse and detachment of structure from concrete stairway Single or two story wood-frame domestic structures built on a perimeter or slab foundation are relatively safe in an earthquake, but in many structures built before 1950 the sill plate that sits between the concrete foundation and the floor diaphragm (perimeter foundation) or studwall (slab foundation) may not be sufficiently bolted in. Additionally, older attachments (without substantial corrosion-proofing) may have corroded to a point of weakness. A sideways shock can slide the building entirely off of the foundations or slab. Often such buildings, especially if constructed on a moderate slope, are erected on a platform connected to a perimeter foundation through low stud-walls called \\"cripple wall\\" or pin-up. This low wall structure itself may fail in shear or in its connections to itself at the corners, leading to the building moving diagonally and collapsing the low walls. The likelihood of failure of the pin-up can be reduced by ensuring that the corners are well reinforced in shear and that the shear panels are well connected to each other through the corner posts. This requires structural grade sheet plywood, often treated for rot resistance. This grade of plywood is made without interior unfilled knots and with more, thinner layers than common plywood. New buildings designed to resist earthquakes will typically use OSB (oriented strand board), sometimes with metal joins between panels, and with well attached stucco covering to enhance its performance. In many modern tract homes, especially those built upon expansive (clay) soil the building is constructed upon a single and relatively thick monolithic slab, kept in one piece by high tensile rods that are stressed after the slab has set. This poststressing places the concrete under compression ‚Äì a condition under which it is extremely strong in bending and so will not crack under adverse soil conditions. =Multiple piers in shallow pits= Some older low-cost structures are elevated on tapered concrete pylons set into shallow pits, a method frequently used to attach outdoor decks to existing buildings. This is seen in conditions of damp soil, especially in tropical conditions, as it leaves a dry ventilated space under the house, and in far northern conditions of permafrost (frozen mud) as it keeps the building's warmth from destabilizing the ground beneath. During an earthquake, the pylons may tip, spilling the building to the ground. This can be overcome by using deep-bored holes to contain cast-in-place reinforced pylons, which are then secured to the floor panel at the corners of the building. Another technique is to add sufficient diagonal bracing or sections of concrete shear wall between pylons. =Reinforced concrete column burst= Jacketed and grouted column on left, unmodified on right Reinforced concrete columns typically contain large diameter vertical rebar (reinforcing bars) arranged in a ring, surrounded by lighter-gauge hoops of rebar. Upon analysis of failures due to earthquakes, it has been realized that the weakness was not in the vertical bars, but rather in inadequate strength and quantity of hoops. Once the integrity of the hoops is breached, the vertical rebar can flex outward, stressing the central column of concrete. The concrete then simply crumbles into small pieces, now unconstrained by the surrounding rebar. In new construction a greater amount of hoop-like structures are used. One simple retrofit is to surround the column with a jacket of steel plates formed and welded into a single cylinder. The space between the jacket and the column is then filled with concrete, a process called grouting. Where soil or structure conditions require such additional modification, additional pilings may be driven near the column base and concrete pads linking the pilings to the pylon are fabricated at or below ground level. In the example shown not all columns needed to be modified to gain sufficient seismic resistance for the conditions expected. (This location is about a mile from the Hayward Fault Zone.) =Reinforced concrete wall burst= Concrete walls are often used at the transition between elevated road fill and overpass structures. The wall is used both to retain the soil and so enable the use of a shorter span and also to transfer the weight of the span directly downward to footings in undisturbed soil. If these walls are inadequate they may crumble under the stress of an earthquake's induced ground motion. One form of retrofit is to drill numerous holes into the surface of the wall, and secure short L-shaped sections of rebar to the surface of each hole with epoxy adhesive. Additional vertical and horizontal rebar is then secured to the new elements, a form is erected, and an additional layer of concrete is poured. This modification may be combined with additional footings in excavated trenches and additional support ledgers and tie-backs to retain the span on the bounding walls. =Damage to masonry (infill) walls = In masonry structures, brick building structures have been reinforced with coatings of glass fiber and appropriate resin (epoxy or polyester). In lower floors these may be applied over entire exposed surfaces, while in upper floors this may be confined to narrow areas around window and door openings. This application provides tensile strength that stiffens the wall against bending away from the side with the application. The efficient protection of an entire building requires extensive analysis and engineering to determine the appropriate locations to be treated. In reinforced concrete buildings, masonry infill walls are considered non- structural elements, but damage to infills can lead to large repair costs and change the behaviour of a structure, even leading to aforementioned soft- storey or beam-column joint shear failures. Local failure of the infill panels due to in and out-of-plane mechanisms, but also due to their combination, can lead to a sudden drop in capacity and hence cause global brittle failure of the structure. Even at lower intensity earthquakes, damage to infilled frames can lead to high economic losses and loss of life. To prevent masonry infill damage and failure, typical retrofit strategies aim to strengthen the infills and provide adequate connection to the frame. Examples of retrofit techniques for masonry infills include steel reinforced plasters, engineered cementitious composites, thin layers fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP), and most recently also textile-reinforced mortars (TRM). =Lift= Where moist or poorly consolidated alluvial soil interfaces in a \\"beach like\\" structure against underlying firm material, seismic waves traveling through the alluvium can be amplified, just as are water waves against a sloping beach. In these special conditions, vertical accelerations up to twice the force of gravity have been measured. If a building is not secured to a well-embedded foundation it is possible for the building to be thrust from (or with) its foundations into the air, usually with severe damage upon landing. Even if it is well-founded, higher portions such as upper stories or roof structures or attached structures such as canopies and porches may become detached from the primary structure. Good practices in modern, earthquake-resistant structures dictate that there be good vertical connections throughout every component of the building, from undisturbed or engineered earth to foundation to sill plate to vertical studs to plate cap through each floor and continuing to the roof structure. Above the foundation and sill plate the connections are typically made using steel strap or sheet stampings, nailed to wood members using special hardened high-shear strength nails, and heavy angle stampings secured with through bolts, using large washers to prevent pull-through. Where inadequate bolts are provided between the sill plates and a foundation in existing construction (or are not trusted due to possible corrosion), special clamp plates may be added, each of which is secured to the foundation using expansion bolts inserted into holes drilled in an exposed face of concrete. Other members must then be secured to the sill plates with additional fittings. =Soil= One of the most difficult retrofits is that required to prevent damage due to soil failure. Soil failure can occur on a slope, a slope failure or landslide, or in a flat area due to liquefaction of water-saturated sand and/or mud. Generally, deep pilings must be driven into stable soil (typically hard mud or sand) or to underlying bedrock or the slope must be stabilized. For buildings built atop previous landslides the practicality of retrofit may be limited by economic factors, as it is not practical to stabilize a large, deep landslide. The likelihood of landslide or soil failure may also depend upon seasonal factors, as the soil may be more stable at the beginning of a wet season than at the beginning of the dry season. Such a \\"two season\\" Mediterranean climate is seen throughout California. In some cases, the best that can be done is to reduce the entrance of water runoff from higher, stable elevations by capturing and bypassing through channels or pipes, and to drain water infiltrated directly and from subsurface springs by inserting horizontal perforated tubes. There are numerous locations in California where extensive developments have been built atop archaic landslides, which have not moved in historic times but which (if both water- saturated and shaken by an earthquake) have a high probability of moving en masse, carrying entire sections of suburban development to new locations. While the most modern of house structures (well tied to monolithic concrete foundation slabs reinforced with post tensioning cables) may survive such movement largely intact, the building will no longer be in its proper location. =Utility pipes and cables: risks= Natural gas and propane supply pipes to structures often prove especially dangerous during and after earthquakes. Should a building move from its foundation or fall due to cripple wall collapse, the ductile iron pipes transporting the gas within the structure may be broken, typically at the location of threaded joints. The gas may then still be provided to the pressure regulator from higher pressure lines and so continue to flow in substantial quantities; it may then be ignited by a nearby source such as a lit pilot light or arcing electrical connection. There are two primary methods of automatically restraining the flow of gas after an earthquake, installed on the low pressure side of the regulator, and usually downstream of the gas meter. *A caged metal ball may be arranged at the edge of an orifice. Upon seismic shock, the ball will roll into the orifice, sealing it to prevent gas flow. The ball may later be reset by the use of an external magnet. This device will respond only to ground motion. *A flow-sensitive device may be used to close a valve if the flow of gas exceeds a set threshold (very much like an electrical circuit breaker). This device will operate independently of seismic motion, but will not respond to minor leaks which may be caused by an earthquake. It appears that the most secure configuration would be to use one of each of these devices in series. =Tunnels= Unless the tunnel penetrates a fault likely to slip, the greatest danger to tunnels is a landslide blocking an entrance. Additional protection around the entrance may be applied to divert any falling material (similar as is done to divert snow avalanches) or the slope above the tunnel may be stabilized in some way. Where only small- to medium-sized rocks and boulders are expected to fall, the entire slope may be covered with wire mesh, pinned down to the slope with metal rods. This is also a common modification to highway cuts where appropriate conditions exist. =Underwater tubes= The safety of underwater tubes is highly dependent upon the soil conditions through which the tunnel was constructed, the materials and reinforcements used, and the maximum predicted earthquake expected, and other factors, some of which may remain unknown under current knowledge. BART tube A tube of particular structural, seismic, economic, and political interest is the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) transbay tube. This tube was constructed at the bottom of San Francisco Bay through an innovative process. Rather than pushing a shield through the soft bay mud, the tube was constructed on land in sections. Each section consisted of two inner train tunnels of circular cross section, a central access tunnel of rectangular cross section, and an outer oval shell encompassing the three inner tubes. The intervening space was filled with concrete. At the bottom of the bay a trench was excavated and a flat bed of crushed stone prepared to receive the tube sections. The sections were then floated into place and sunk, then joined with bolted connections to previously-placed sections. An overfill was then placed atop the tube to hold it down. Once completed from San Francisco to Oakland, the tracks and electrical components were installed. The predicted response of the tube during a major earthquake was likened to be as that of a string of (cooked) spaghetti in a bowl of gelatin dessert. To avoid overstressing the tube due to differential movements at each end, a sliding slip joint was included at the San Francisco terminus under the landmark Ferry Building. The engineers of the construction consortium PBTB (Parsons Brinckerhoff-Tudor-Bechtel) used the best estimates of ground motion available at the time, now known to be insufficient given modern computational analysis methods and geotechnical knowledge. Unexpected settlement of the tube has reduced the amount of slip that can be accommodated without failure. These factors have resulted in the slip joint being designed too short to ensure survival of the tube under possible (perhaps even likely) large earthquakes in the region. To correct this deficiency the slip joint must be extended to allow for additional movement, a modification expected to be both expensive and technically and logistically difficult. Other retrofits to the BART tube include vibratory consolidation of the tube's overfill to avoid potential liquefying of the overfill, which has now been completed. (Should the overfill fail there is a danger of portions of the tube rising from the bottom, an event which could potentially cause failure of the section connections.) Bridge retrofit Bridges have several failure modes. =Expansion rockers= Many short bridge spans are statically anchored at one end and attached to rockers at the other. This rocker gives vertical and transverse support while allowing the bridge span to expand and contract with temperature changes. The change in the length of the span is accommodated over a gap in the roadway by comb-like expansion joints. During severe ground motion, the rockers may jump from their tracks or be moved beyond their design limits, causing the bridge to unship from its resting point and then either become misaligned or fail completely. Motion can be constrained by adding ductile or high-strength steel restraints that are friction-clamped to beams and designed to slide under extreme stress while still limiting the motion relative to the anchorage. = Deck rigidity = Additional diagonals were inserted under both decks of this bridge Suspension bridges may respond to earthquakes with a side-to-side motion exceeding that which was designed for wind gust response. Such motion can cause fragmentation of the road surface, damage to bearings, and plastic deformation or breakage of components. Devices such as hydraulic dampers or clamped sliding connections and additional diagonal reinforcement may be added. =Lattice girders, beams, and ties= Obsolete riveted lattice members Lattice girders consist of two \\"I\\"-beams connected with a criss-cross lattice of flat strap or angle stock. These can be greatly strengthened by replacing the open lattice with plate members. This is usually done in concert with the replacement of hot rivets with bolts. Bolted plate lattice replacement, forming box members =Hot rivets= Many older structures were fabricated by inserting red-hot rivets into pre-drilled holes; the soft rivets are then peened using an air hammer on one side and a bucking bar on the head end. As these cool slowly, they are left in an annealed (soft) condition, while the plate, having been hot rolled and quenched during manufacture, remains relatively hard. Under extreme stress the hard plates can shear the soft rivets, resulting in failure of the joint. The solution is to burn out each rivet with an oxygen torch. The hole is then prepared to a precise diameter with a reamer. A special locator bolt, consisting of a head, a shaft matching the reamed hole, and a threaded end is inserted and retained with a nut, then tightened with a wrench. As the bolt has been formed from an appropriate high-strength alloy and has also been heat-treated, it is not subject to either the plastic shear failure typical of hot rivets nor the brittle fracture of ordinary bolts. Any partial failure will be in the plastic flow of the metal secured by the bolt; with proper engineering any such failure should be non-catastrophic. =Fill and overpass= Elevated roadways are typically built on sections of elevated earth fill connected with bridge-like segments, often supported with vertical columns. If the soil fails where a bridge terminates, the bridge may become disconnected from the rest of the roadway and break away. The retrofit for this is to add additional reinforcement to any supporting wall, or to add deep caissons adjacent to the edge at each end and connect them with a supporting beam under the bridge. Another failure occurs when the fill at each end moves (through resonant effects) in bulk, in opposite directions. If there is an insufficient founding shelf for the overpass, then it may fall. Additional shelf and ductile stays may be added to attach the overpass to the footings at one or both ends. The stays, rather than being fixed to the beams, may instead be clamped to them. Under moderate loading, these keep the overpass centered in the gap so that it is less likely to slide off its founding shelf at one end. The ability for the fixed ends to slide, rather than break, will prevent the complete drop of the structure if it should fail to remain on the footings. =Viaducts= Large sections of roadway may consist entirely of viaduct, sections with no connection to the earth other than through vertical columns. When concrete columns are used, the detailing is critical. Typical failure may be in the toppling of a row of columns due either to soil connection failure or to insufficient cylindrical wrapping with rebar. Both failures were seen in the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake in Kobe, Japan, where an entire viaduct, centrally supported by a single row of large columns, was laid down to one side. Such columns are reinforced by excavating to the foundation pad, driving additional pilings, and adding a new, larger pad, well connected with rebar alongside or into the column. A column with insufficient wrapping bar, which is prone to burst and then hinge at the bursting point, may be completely encased in a circular or elliptical jacket of welded steel sheet and grouted as described above. Cypress Freeway viaduct collapse. Note failure of inadequate anti-burst wrapping and lack of connection between upper and lower vertical elements. Sometimes viaducts may fail in the connections between components. This was seen in the failure of the Cypress Freeway in Oakland, California, during the Loma Prieta earthquake. This viaduct was a two-level structure, and the upper portions of the columns were not well connected to the lower portions that supported the lower level; this caused the upper deck to collapse upon the lower deck. Weak connections such as these require additional external jacketing ‚Äì either through external steel components or by a complete jacket of reinforced concrete, often using stub connections that are glued (using epoxy adhesive) into numerous drilled holes. These stubs are then connected to additional wrappings, external forms (which may be temporary or permanent) are erected, and additional concrete is poured into the space. Large connected structures similar to the Cypress Viaduct must also be properly analyzed in their entirety using dynamic computer simulations. Residential retrofit Side-to-side forces cause most earthquake damage. Bolting of the mudsill to the foundation and application of plywood to cripple walls are a few basic retrofit techniques which homeowners may apply to wood-framed residential structures to mitigate the effects of seismic activity. The City of San Leandro created guidelines for these procedures, as outlined in the following pamphlet. Public awareness and initiative are critical to the retrofit and preservation of existing building stock, and such efforts as those of the Association of Bay Area Governments are instrumental in providing informational resources to seismically active communities. =Wood frame structure= Most houses in North America are wood- framed structures. Wood is one of the best materials for earthquake-resistant construction since it is lightweight and more flexible than masonry. It is easy to work with and less expensive than steel, masonry, or concrete. In older homes the most significant weaknesses are the connection from the wood- framed walls to the foundation and the relatively weak \\"cripple-walls.\\" (Cripple walls are the short wood walls that extend from the top of the foundation to the lowest floor level in houses that have raised floors.) Adding connections from the base of the wood-framed structure to the foundation is almost always an important part of a seismic retrofit. Bracing the cripple-walls to resist side-to-side forces is essential in houses with cripple walls; bracing is usually done with plywood. Oriented strand board (OSB) does not perform as consistently as plywood, and is not the favored choice of retrofit designers or installers. Retrofit methods in older wood- frame structures may consist of the following, and other methods not described here. *The lowest plate rails of walls (usually called \\"mudsills\\" or \\"foundation sills\\" in North America) are bolted to a continuous foundation, or secured with rigid metal connectors bolted to the foundation so as to resist side-to-side forces. *Cripple walls are braced with plywood. *Selected vertical elements (typically the posts at the ends of plywood wall bracing panels) are connected to the foundation. These connections are intended to prevent the braced walls from rocking up and down when subjected to back-and- forth forces at the top of the braced walls, not to resist the wall or house \\"jumping\\" off the foundation (which almost never occurs). *In two story buildings using \\"platform framing\\" (sometimes called \\"western\\" style construction, where walls are progressively erected upon the lower story's upper diaphragm, unlike \\"eastern\\" or balloon framing), the upper walls are connected to the lower walls with tension elements. In some cases, connections may be extended vertically to include retention of certain roof elements. This sort of strengthening is usually very costly with respect to the strength gained. *Vertical posts are secured to the beams or other members they support. This is particularly important where loss of support would lead to collapse of a segment of a building. Connections from posts to beams cannot resist appreciable side-to-side forces; it is much more important to strengthen around the perimeter of a building (bracing the cripple-walls and supplementing foundation-to-wood-framing connections) than it is to reinforce post-to-beam connections. Wooden framing is efficient when combined with masonry, if the structure is properly designed. In Turkey, the traditional houses (bagdadi) are made with this technology. In El Salvador, wood and bamboo are used for residential construction. =Reinforced and unreinforced masonry= In many parts of developing countries such as Pakistan, Iran and China, unreinforced or in some cases reinforced masonry is the predominantly form of structures for rural residential and dwelling. Masonry was also a common construction form in the early part of the 20th century, which implies that a substantial number of these at-risk masonry structures would have significant heritage value. Masonry walls that are not reinforced are especially hazardous. Such structures may be more appropriate for replacement than retrofit, but if the walls are the principal load bearing elements in structures of modest size they may be appropriately reinforced. It is especially important that floor and ceiling beams be securely attached to the walls. Additional vertical supports in the form of steel or reinforced concrete may be added. In the western United States, much of what is seen as masonry is actually brick or stone veneer. Current construction rules dictate the amount of tie‚Äìback required, which consist of metal straps secured to vertical structural elements. These straps extend into mortar courses, securing the veneer to the primary structure. Older structures may not secure this sufficiently for seismic safety. A weakly secured veneer in a house interior (sometimes used to face a fireplace from floor to ceiling) can be especially dangerous to occupants. Older masonry chimneys are also dangerous if they have substantial vertical extension above the roof. These are prone to breakage at the roofline and may fall into the house in a single large piece. For retrofit, additional supports may be added; however, it is extremely expensive to strengthen an existing masonry chimney to conform with contemporary design standards. It is best to simply remove the extension and replace it with lighter materials, with special metal flue replacing the flue tile and a wood structure replacing the masonry. This may be matched against existing brickwork by using very thin veneer (similar to a tile, but with the appearance of a brick).

Operation Tabarin was a secret British Antarctic expedition, during World War II. It was launched in 1943 under the pretense of patrolling the Antarctic for German commerce raiders and U-boats that threatened Allied shipping. The expedition resulted in the establishment of a number of bases, thus strengthening British territorial claims to the area. The expedition led to the collection of large amounts of rock, fossil and botanical specimens as well as meteorological, topographical data and glaciological measurements. Following its end in 1946, its mission was continued by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. Background Following the outbreak of World War II, Allied shipping across the globe became vulnerable to attacks by German Navy commerce raiders and U-boats. The British Falkland Islands and the waters of the Antarctic were no exception. On 13 January 1941, began attacking the unarmed and unescorted Norwegian whaling fleet. Pinguin managed to seize a haul of 20,320 ton of whale oil from whalers Solglimt, and Ole Wegger, making it one of the largest prizes seized by a commerce raider during the war. Once whaler Thorshammer alerted the British authorities on the Falklands, the armed merchant cruiser began patrolling the area between South Georgia, the South Shetland Islands and Weddell Sea. On 5 March, it visited Deception Island, where its crew set fire to a coal dump and sabotaged oil tanks, supply and discharge pumps belonging to an abandoned Norwegian whaling station to prevent their use as a supply base by the Germans. In December 1941, the entry of Japan into the war created a new threat to British overseas possessions. The Falklands were protected by an insufficient force of 330 local volunteers with few weapons. Such an invasion would have made navigation around Cape Horn untenable and put Allied convoys heading to India and the Middle East in great danger. The war also threatened to reignite the longstanding Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute with neutral Argentina. In January 1942, Argentina's Comisi√≥n Nacional del Ant√°rtico dispatched the transport to Deception Island, afterwards sailing to the Melchior Islands, Palmer Archipelago and Winter Island. Argentine flags were raised in these locations and all territories south of 60¬∞ S and between 25¬∞ W and 68.34¬∞ W were declared annexed. On 28 January 1943, the Colonial Office proposed dispatching the armed merchant cruiser to Deception Island after it had falsely claimed that a German commerce raider had been spotted in the area. Although by then, the threat of German commerce raiders had largely subsided, the deliberate ruse was enacted in order to conceal Britain's intentions from the U.S. and counter Argentina's ambitions. Upon reaching Deception Island, Carnarvon Castle replaced the Argentinian flag with the Union Jack and placed four British Crown Land signs. A month later Primero de Mayo returned and replaced the Argentinian flags. It then became obvious that only physical presence could settle the matter. Expedition Deception Island in the South Shetland Islands Planning for Operation Bransfield began on 27 May 1943. Named after Antarctic explorer Edward Bransfield, it was quickly changed to Operation Tabarin (after Paris- based cabaret Bal Tabarin) so as not to reveal its objectives. Polar experts Neil Mackintosh, James Wordie and Brian Roberts took up the planning of the endeavor. Experienced Scottish marine biologist and polar explorer Lieutenant James Marr was selected as the head of the expedition. Marr now a Lieutenant Commander flew to Iceland where he procured Norwegian sealer Veslekari which was assigned the name Bransfield. He then went on to recruit the following expedition members: * Ivan Mackenzie Lamb, lichenologist * Lewis Ashton, carpenter * William Roberts Flett, geologist * Eric Back, medical officer * Andrew Taylor, surveyor * Victor Marchesi, sea captain * Gwion \\"Taff\\" Davies (stores officer) * Gordon Howkins, meteorologist * Fram Farrington, operator * Charles Smith, able seaman * Norman Layther, wireless operator * Thomas Berry, cook * Kenneth Blair, handyman Trinity Peninsula Bransfield proved to be unsuitable for the expedition as its freshwater tanks suffered from leaks; the party therefore traveled on the troopship . On 14 December, Highland Monarch departed from Avonmouth, making stops at Gibraltar and Montevideo before reaching Port Stanley. There, the expedition's members re-embarked into Fitzroy and . At 11 a.m. on 3 February 1944, the expedition landed at Port Foster, Deception Island. Much to the relief of its members the expedition found no signs of Argentine presence in the port apart from a flag painted on a fuel tank. Orders had previously been issued to avoid confrontation with the Argentines and the Chileans at all cost. The decrepit whaling station was transformed into Base B, where Flett, Matheson, Smith, Layther, and Howkins were to continue their work. On 6 February, the remainder of the expedition set course for Hope Bay where Station A was to be established. At 1 p.m. on 7 February, William Scoresby dropped its anchor off Hope Bay. The following day Marr was informed that Fitzroy would not be able to proceed to Hope Bay as ice being blown into the area by easterly wind could potentially trap the ship. A plan to reload Fitzroy's cargo into Scoresby was discarded because of the latter's limited capacity. Abandoning Hope Bay on 10 February the two ships pushed south-west along Graham Land and to Port Lockroy once heavy fog lifted. Although it was known as a safe harbor, Port Lockroy's location restricted the range of scientific activities that the team intended to perform due to the fact that Gerlache Strait rarely froze, thus limiting access to the mainland. The ensuing ennui posed the risk of causing the team members to experience cabin fever as was the case on the Belgian Antarctic Expedition. The cargo was unloaded at the site of the newly established Station A on Goudier Island. The first stage of the construction of the main hut christened Bransfield House was completed on 17 February, allowing William Scoresby and Fitzroy to return to the Falklands. On 19 March, Station A was visited by William Scoresby, which brought John Blyth, a carpenter from the Falklands, who joined the team. On 23 March, the Port Lockroy Post Office began its operation, with Farrington acting as censor. Falkland Island stamps overprinted with the inscription \\"Graham Land, Dependency of\\" were used. A day earlier, four expedition members had planted a Union Jack and a British Crown Land sign on Cape Renard. On 23 April, the Stanley Post Office burnt to the ground. With correspondence now passing through Montevideo, the expedition's existence came to be known to the outside world. Survey work began in early May with the collection of rock samples from the foot of Jabet Peak and Savoia Peak. Lamb collected lichen samples and conducted experiments on the accumulation of snow and subsequent thawing. Lamb discovered a number of lichen species, including Verrucaria serpuloides, the only known true marine lichen, thus making a considerable contribution to the taxonomy of Antarctic lichens. Later on Lamb visited Station B collecting specimens of amphipoda, ctenophora, sea urchins, worms and sponges from the beaches and shallow waters of Deception Island. On 18 November, a sledging expedition was launched on Wiencke Island where bird and lichen specimens were gathered, the former for the needs of the British Museum. On 6 December, William Scoresby returned to Station B bringing plants native to the Falklands and soil for Lamb to conduct a transplantation experiment, which ultimately failed due to low humidity and strong winds. On 3 February 1945, Fitzroy and the 550 ton sealer Eagle arrived at Port Lockroy, with Victor Russell and David James, Norman Bertram Marshall, Gordon Lockley, Frank White, Alan Reece, Thomas Donnachie and Norman Layther aboard. Stores, equipment and crew members destined for the erection of an unmanned Base E on Stonington Island moved into Eagle, others boarded William Scoresby and Fitzroy in order to build Station D on Hope Bay. On 7 February, Marr resigned on account of poor health and later returned to the Falklands, with Taylor replacing him as expedition leader. Taylor abandoned the plan to build the Stonington Island station focusing his attention on Station D. On 13 February, Seal Point was selected as the most suitable location for Station D and the first steps for its erection were made, construction was completed on 20 March. On 23 February, a hut was built on Coronation Island to reinforce British claims to the area. Later on the British expedition paid the Argentine meteorological station on Laurie Island a courtesy visit. A few fossil specimens were collected at Hope Bay in February, with systematic gathering of paleobotanical specimens from Mount Flora's shale beginning on 8 June. A sledging expedition from Hope was launched in August. On 29 December, the sledging party returned to Base D, having visited Vortex Island, Duse Bay, James Ross Island and numerous small islands in its vicinity. The trip resulted in of lichen, fossil and rock samples, meteorological and glaciological measurements as well as corrections to Otto Nordenskj√∂ld's maps. On 14 January 1946, William Scoresby, Fitzroy and 300-ton sealer Trepassey began evacuating the members of the expedition to the Falklands. On 11 February, those serving in the military boarded , and the rest sailed home on Highland Monarch. Aftermath The end of World War II led to renewed interest in the Antarctic region. The United States refused to recognise any foreign territorial claims to Antarctica, initiating Operation Highjump. Argentina and Chile signed the Argentine-Chilean Agreement on Joint Defence of \\"Antarctic Rights\\", a defence agreement that envisioned potential military action over disputed Antarctic lands. Chile organized its First Chilean Antarctic Expedition in 1947‚Äì1948. Among other accomplishments, it brought Chilean President Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla to inaugurate one of its bases personally, and he thereby became the first head of state to set foot on the continent. Britain, on the other hand, continued the operation of the bases built during Operation Tabarin by transferring them to the newly-established Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. Operation Tabarin veterans Reece, White and Rusell remained at their bases and continued their work for the FIDS. Participants of Operation Tabarin were awarded the Polar Medal in 1953.

Biography Montauban was born in Paris. As a cavalry officer he saw much service in Algeria, but he was still only a colonel when in 1847 he effected the capture of Abdel Kadir. Between January 1855 and November 1857, Montauban commanded the Division of Oran in western Algeria. In 1855 he was sent to fight in the Crimea. He was appointed in 1858 to a command at home, and at the close of 1859 was selected to lead the French troops in the Anglo-French expedition to China. His conduct of the operations did not escape criticism, but in 1862 he received from Napoleon III, the title of comte de Palikao (from the Battle of Palikao); he had already been made a senator. The allegation that he had acquired a vast fortune by the plunder of the Old Summer Palace in Peking seems to have been without foundation. In 1865 he was appointed to the command of the IV army corps at Lyon, in the training of which he displayed exceptional energy and administrative capacity. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 he was not given a command in the field, but after the opening disasters had shaken the Ollivier ministry he was entrusted by the empress-regent with the portfolio of war, and became president of the council (10 August). He at once, with great success, reorganized the military resources of the nation. He claimed to have raised Marshal MacMahon's force at Ch√¢lons to 140,000 men, to have created three new army corps, 33 new regiments and 100,000 gardes mobiles, and to have brought the defences of the capital to a state of efficiency - all this in 24 days. He conceived the idea of sending the Army of Ch√¢lons to raise the blockade of Metz. The scheme depended on a precision and rapidity of which the Army of Ch√¢lons was no longer capable, and ended with the disaster of Sedan. After the capitulation of the emperor the dictatorship was offered to Palikao, but he refused to desert the empire, and proposed to establish a council of national defence, with himself as lieutenant-general of government. Before a decision was made, the chamber was invaded by the mob, and Palikao fled to Belgium. In 1871 he appeared before the parliamentary commission of inquiry, and in the same year established Un Ministre de la guerre de vingt-quatre jours. He died at Versailles.

She was also a college graduate, dietitian, educator, business owner, and author. Personal life Ruth Wakefield was born \\"Ruth Jones Graves\\", daughter of Fred Graves and the former Helen Vest Jones (Helen Graves), in East Walpole, Massachusetts on June 17, 1903. Wakefield grew up in Easton, Massachusetts, and graduated from Oliver Ames High School in 1920. Wakefield was educated at Framingham State Normal School Department of Household Arts in 1924. There, she worked as a dietitian and lectured about foods. In 1928, she and her husband Kenneth Donald Wakefield (1897‚Äì1997) had a son, Kenneth Donald Wakefield Jr. Toll House Inn In 1930, she and her husband bought a tourist lodge (the Toll House Inn) in Whitman in Plymouth County. Located about halfway between Boston and New Bedford, it was a place where passengers had historically paid a toll, changed horses, and ate home-cooked meals. When the Wakefields opened their business, they named the establishment the Toll House Inn. Ruth cooked and served all the food and soon gained local fame for her lobster dinners and desserts. People from across the region visited the Toll House, including notables such as US Ambassador Joseph Kennedy, Sr. Her chocolate chip cookies soon became very popular. She invented chocolate chip cookies around 1938. Chocolate chip cookie Ruth Wakefield invented the chocolate chip cookie. She added chopped up bits from a Nestl√© semi-sweet chocolate bar into a cookie. It is often incorrectly reported that the cookie was an accident, and that Wakefield expected the chocolate chunks to melt making chocolate cookies. In reality, Wakefield stated that she deliberately invented the cookie. She said, \\"We had been serving a thin butterscotch nut cookie with ice cream. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was trying to give them something different. So I came up with Toll House cookie.\\" Wakefield wrote a best selling cookbook, Toll House Tried and True Recipes,Toll House Tried and True Recipes, 1940. Retrieved May 3, 2012. that went through 39 printings starting in 1930. The 1938 edition of the cookbook was the first to include the recipe for a chocolate chip cookie, the \\"Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie\\". During WWII, US soldiers from Massachusetts who were stationed overseas shared the cookies they received in care packages from back home with soldiers from other parts of the US. Soon, hundreds of soldiers were writing home asking their families to send them some Toll House cookies, and Wakefield was soon inundated with letters from around the world requesting her recipe. Thus began the nationwide craze for the chocolate chip cookie. As the popularity of the Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie increased, the sales of Nestl√©'s semi-sweet chocolate bars also spiked. Andrew Nestl√© and Ruth Wakefield made a business arrangement: Wakefield gave Nestl√© the right to use her cookie recipe and the Toll House name for one dollar and a lifetime supply of Nestl√© chocolate. Nestl√© began marketing chocolate chips to be used especially for cookies and printing the recipe for the Toll House Cookie on its package. Wakefield's invention met this need and went on to be the most popular cookie of all time. Chocolate chip cookies are still consumed today and currently exist in a market space of over $18 billion in the US. Death Wakefield died on January 10, 1977 following a long illness in Jordan Hospital in Plymouth, Massachusetts.Staff report (January 11, 1977). Ruth Wakefield, at 73; created toll house cookie.

While there he acted as a critical observer of North American society, almost as if returning a status report on their progress. This can be compared to the style of his Pictures from Italy written four years later, where he wrote far more like a tourist. His American journey was also an inspiration for his novel Martin Chuzzlewit. Having arrived in Boston, he visited Lowell, New York, and Philadelphia, and travelled as far south as Richmond, as far west as St. Louis and as far north as Quebec. The American city he liked best was Boston ‚Äì \\"the air was so clear, the houses were so bright and gay. [...] The city is a beautiful one, and cannot fail, I should imagine, to impress all strangers very favourably.\\" Further, it was close to the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum for the Blind where Dickens encountered Laura Bridgman, who impressed him greatly. Background On 3 January 1842, one month shy of his 30th birthday, Dickens sailed with his wife, Catherine, and her maid, Anne Brown, from Liverpool on board the steamship RMS Britannia bound for America. Arriving in Boston on 22 January 1842, the author was at once mobbed. Dickens at first revelled in the attention, but soon the endless demands on his time began to wear on his enthusiasm. He complained in a letter to his friend John Forster: > I can do nothing that I want to do, go nowhere where I want to go, and see > nothing that I want to see. If I turn into the street, I am followed by a > multitude. He travelled mainly on the East Coast and the Great Lakes area of both the United States and Canada, primarily by steamboat, but also by rail and coach. During his extensive itinerary, he made a particular point of visiting prisons and mental institutions and even took a quick glimpse at the prairie. Among his early visits to American institutions, Dickens visited Perkins School for the Blind near Boston, where he met Laura Bridgman, who is considered the first deaf-blind person to receive a significant education in English. His account of this meeting in American Notes would inspire Helen Keller's parents to seek an education for their daughter. He was particularly critical of the American press and the sanitary conditions of American cities. He also wrote merciless parodies of the manners of the locals, including, but not limited to, their rural conversations and practice of spitting tobacco in public (Ch. 8 ‚Äì Washington): > As Washington may be called the headquarters of tobacco-tinctured saliva, > the time is come when I must confess, without any disguise, that the > prevalence of those two odious practices of chewing and expectorating began > about this time to be anything but agreeable, and soon became most offensive > and sickening. In Washington, D.C., he called upon President John Tyler in the White House, writing that: > ...he looked somewhat worn and anxious, and well he might; being at war with > everybody ‚Äì but the expression of his face was mild and pleasant, and his > manner was remarkably unaffected, gentlemanly, and agreeable. I thought that > in his whole carriage and demeanour, he became his station singularly well. Although generally impressed by what he found, he could not forgive the continued existence of slavery in the United States, and the final chapters of the book are devoted to a criticism of the practice. He was also unhappy about copyright issues. Dickens, by this time, had become an international celebrity, but owing to the lack of an international copyright law, bootleg copies of his works were freely available in North America and he could not abide losing money. Dickens called for international copyright law in many of his speeches in America, and his persistence in discussing the subject led some critics to accuse him of having traveled to America primarily to agitate for that cause.Hudon, Edward G. \\"Literary Piracy, Charles Dickens and the American Copyright Law.\\" American Bar Association Journal, Vol.50, No.12 (December, 1964) p. 1159. Dickens' letters home to his friends, including John Forster and illustrator Daniel Maclise, helped to form the basis of the book. Critique of US society at the time Throughout the narrative, finding much to admire in Americans he met and in their way of life, he also notes what he sees as their faults, sometimes jocularly. Then, in a conclusion, he gives his considered analysis of what he views as major flaws in US society. First and most serious is slavery. Apart from its corruption of both whites and blacks in slave states, the free states are complicit in the system. In particular, he is horrified by the physical violence vented on both male and female slaves. Next, he places violence. The ideals of liberty and equality seem to include the freedom to shoot or knife any other American. Third, he cites what he calls universal distrust, the extreme individualism that leads people to suspect others and to seek advantage over them. With a few exceptions, the scandal-seeking press contributes by undermining private life and destroying confidence in public life. Allied to this is the overriding commercialism, with the urge to pull off a smart deal and the idolisation of successful businessmen. In this capitalist jungle, he finds most people far too serious and puritanical, lacking humour and a wider perspective. Finally, in too many places he finds standards of personal cleanliness and public health still very primitive and is particularly disgusted by the almost universal habit of spitting. Title According to Dickens' biographer Michael Slater, the title American Notes for General Circulation may have been a joke at the expense of American currency. The end of the Second Bank of the United States and the ensuing Panic of 1837 led to widespread bank failures and rendered much paper currency worthless. Documentary (2005) The book formed the basis for Dickens in America (2005), an authored documentary series by Miriam Margolyes in which she followed Dickens' journey through the United States, visiting many of the places mentioned by the author in his book.

Ethnoarchaeology aids archaeologists in reconstructing ancient lifeways by studying the material and non-material traditions of modern societies. Ethnoarchaeology also aids in the understanding of the way an object was made and the purpose of what it is being used for. Archaeologists can then infer that ancient societies used the same techniques as their modern counterparts given a similar set of environmental circumstances. One good example of ethnoarchaeology is that of Brian Hayden (1987), whose team examined the manufacture of Mesoamerican quern-stones, providing valuable insights into the manufacture of prehistoric quern-stones. Many other studies have focused on the manufacture and use of ceramics, architecture, food, fiber, and other types of material culture. In the best cases, these studies have involved long term ethnographic fieldwork (for example, Herbich 1987, Kramer 1997, Deal 1998, Dietler & Herbich 1998, Hinshaw 2000, Longacre & Skibo 2000, Kohn 2010). Origins and development Although ethnography has long been used by archaeologists to draw analogies to the past, ethnographic data is not gathered with specifically archaeological goals in mind. Ethnoarchaeology developed as a response to the feeling among archaeologists that ethnography did not adequately answer their own specific research questions. American archaeologist Jesse Walter Fewkes first mentioned the \\"ethno-archaeologist\\" in 1900, and encouraged archaeologists to conduct their own ethnographic field work. Widespread acceptance of ethnoarchaeology as a true subdiscipline of archaeology did not emerge until the late 1950s and 1960s, as archaeologists began to explore the different scientific applications it might have. Ethnoarchaeology today has become a widely accepted research practice, with a few archaeologists even identifying as \\"ethnoarchaeologists\\" rather than simply \\"archaeologists.\\" Analogy Analogy in archaeology is, essentially, applying observed behavior to non- observed behavior. It is perhaps one of the most used research tools in archaeological interpretation. Analogies can best be drawn between those cultures who share similar environments. More importantly, these cultures must interact with their habitats in ways that are comparable to one another. It is important to keep in mind that analogies can only provide clues and not sound, definitive answers to research questions. For this reason, G.S. McCall calls for a comparative view for analysis in his cross-cultural study of the Gamo and Konso of southern and central Ethiopia, the Siberian Chukchi, highland New Guinea, highland Maya of Guatemala and Mexico, central, northern, and western arid regions of Australia, the Tjmba of northern Namibia, and the Xeta of Amazonia and their uses of lithics.McCall, G. S. (2012). Ethnoarchaeology and the organization of lithic technology. Journal of Archaeological Research, 20(2), 157-203. =Formal Analogies= Formal analogies are made with the assumption that, as Paul Lane describes, \\"because two objects or contexts share a similar appearance or shape, they are likely to share other properties as well, typically that of function.\\" One of the major issues with this approach is that often these objects or contexts that initially appeared similar may have been used for very different purposes or served different functions. Perhaps the different objects were even created differently. In a 1971 study, Gould and his team compared working edge angle of Mousterain Quina scrapers and modern Western Desert Aboriginal scrapers and found the Mousterain angles to be steeper. Gould reasoned this was due to the Western Desert Aborigines retouching the scrapers further than the Hominids of the Mousterian. Gould et al. concluded that this method of studying ethnographic tool use for comparison could be employed to determine what tools were used for. =Relational Analogies= Relational analogies are opposite from formal analogies. Instead of just drawing the conclusions, one must prove the relationship, and both sides of the analogy are studied and a relationship must be demonstrated between the ethnographic object and the archaeological object. Direct Historical Approach One popular method in ethnoarchaeology is the use of the direct historical approach. This approach relies on living cultures that may be closely genetically or spatially related to the archaeological culture of interest in order to form analogies that may be used to explain findings. Gould and his team explains how archaeologists should be able to measure the degree of differences between the tools found with the ethnographic material and the artifacts However, while this technique may be useful it is important to note that it does not account for cultural change over time. The \\"folk cultural approach\\" is the Old World equivalent to this and the term may be used in place of the direct historical approach. Issues Ethnography can provide insights of value to archaeologists into how people in the past may have lived, especially with regard to their social structures, religious beliefs and other aspects of their culture. However, it is still unclear how to relate most of the insights generated by this anthropological research to archaeological investigations. This is due to the lack of emphasis by anthropologists on the material remains created and discarded by societies and on how these material remains vary with differences in how a society is organised. This general problem has led archaeologists (for example, London [2000]) to argue that anthropological work is not adequate for answering archaeological problems, and that archaeologists should therefore undertake ethnoarchaeological work to answer these problems. These studies have focused far more on the manufacture, use and discard of tools and other artifacts and have sought to answer such questions as what kinds of objects used in a living settlement are deposited in middens or other places where they may be preserved, and how likely an object is to be discarded near to the place where it was used. Another issue often faced in ethnoarchaeology is the potential for a single archaeological situation to have multiple possible analogies drawn from it. A process of elimination must take place to narrow down all of the possibilities until the best solution can be discovered. See also *Kalinga Ethnoarchaeological Project Bibliography *David, N. & C.

The exact boundary between these two regions is not precisely defined. Nevertheless, the self-perception of the Chinese nation, especially regional stereotypes, has often been dominated by these two concepts, given that regional differences in culture and language have historically fostered strong regional identities of the Chinese people.  Extent  Often used as the geographical dividing line between northern and southern China is the Qinling‚ÄìHuaihe Line (lit. Qin Mountains‚ÄìHuai River Line). This line approximates the 0 ¬∞C January isotherm and the isohyet in China. Culturally, however, the division is more ambiguous. In the eastern provinces like Jiangsu and Anhui, the Yangtze River may instead be perceived as the north‚Äìsouth boundary instead of the Huai River, but this is a recent development. There is an ambiguous area, the region around Nanyang, Henan, that lies in the gap where the Qin has ended and the Huai River has not yet begun; in addition, central Anhui and Jiangsu lie south of the Huai River but north of the Yangtze, making their classification somewhat ambiguous as well. As such, the boundary between northern and southern China does not follow provincial boundaries; it cuts through Shaanxi, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, and creates areas such as Hanzhong (Shaanxi), Xinyang (Henan), Huaibei (Anhui) and Xuzhou (Jiangsu) that lie on an opposite half of China from the rest of their respective provinces. This may have been deliberate; the Yuan dynasty and Ming dynasty established many of these boundaries intentionally to discourage anti- dynastic regionalism. The Northeast and Inner Mongolia are conceived to belong to northern China according to the framework above. At some times in history, Xinjiang, Tibet and Qinghai were not conceived of as being part of either the north or south. However, internal migration, such as between the Shandong and Liaodong peninsulas during the Chuang Guandong period, have increased the purview of \\"north\\" China to include previously marginalized areas.  History  The concepts of northern and southern China originate from differences in climate, geography, culture, and physical traits; as well as several periods of actual political division in history. Northern and north eastern China is considered too cold and dry for rice cultivation (though rice is grown there today with the aid of modern technology) and consists largely of flat plains, grasslands, and desert; while Southern China is warm and rainy enough for rice and consists of lush mountains cut by river valleys. Historically, these differences have led to differences in warfare during the pre-modern era, as cavalry could easily dominate the northern plains but encountered difficulties against river navies fielded in the south. There are also major differences in cuisine, culture, and popular entertainment forms such as opera. The Qin Mountains and Huai River approximately separate northern Mandarin-speaking regions on the one hand, and southwestern Mandarin-, eastern Mandarin-, and non-Mandarin-speaking regions on the other. (\\"Mandarin\\" and \\"Southern\\" on this map refer to Sinitic languages, while other groups are not Sinitic.)Source: United States Central Intelligence Agency, 1990. The Qin Mountains and Huai River also mark the approximate boundary between wheat and rice cultivation. Episodes of division into North and South include: * Three Kingdoms (220‚Äì280) * Sixteen Kingdoms (317‚Äì420) and Southern and Northern Dynasties (420‚Äì589) * Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907‚Äì960) * Southern Song dynasty (1127‚Äì1279) and Jin dynasty (1115‚Äì1234) * Warlord era (1916‚Äì1928) of the Republic of China The Northern and Southern Dynasties showed such a high level of polarization between North and South that sometimes northerners and southerners referred to each other as barbarians; Yuan subjects were divided into four political status classes. Northerners including Khitans and other ethnic groups occupy the third-caste and southern natives occupying the lowest one. For a large part of Chinese history, northern China was economically more advanced than southern China . The Jurchen and Mongol invasion caused a massive migration to southern China, and the Emperor shifted the Song dynasty capital city from Kaifeng in northern China to Hangzhou, located south of the Yangtze river. The population of Shanghai increased from 12,000 households to over 250,000 inhabitants after Kaifeng was sacked by invading armies. This began a shift of political, economic and cultural power from northern China to southern China. The east coast of southern China remained a leading economic and cultural center of China until the Republic of China. Today, southern China remains economically more prosperous than northern China. During the Qing dynasty, regional differences and identification in China fostered the growth of regional stereotypes. Such stereotypes often appeared in historic chronicles and gazetteers and were based on geographic circumstances, historical and literary associations (e.g. people from Shandong, were considered upright and honest) and Chinese cosmology (as the south was associated with the fire element, Southerners were considered hot-tempered). These differences were reflected in Qing dynasty policies, such as the prohibition on local officials to serve their home areas, as well as conduct of personal and commercial relations. In 1730, the Kangxi Emperor made the observation in the Tingxun Geyan („ÄäÂ∫≠Ë®ìÊ†ºË®Ä„Äã): During the Republican period, Lu Xun, a major Chinese writer, wrote:  Today  GDP per capita in 2004. Disparity in terms of wealth runs in the east-west direction rather than north‚Äìsouth direction. The map, based on provincial borders, also hides an additional sharp disparity between urban and rural areas. However, the southeast coast is still wealthier than the northeast coast in per capita terms. In modern times, North and South is merely one of the ways that Chinese people identify themselves, and the divide between northern and southern China has been complicated both by a unified Chinese nationalism as well as by local loyalties to linguistically and culturally distinct regions within province, prefecture, county, town and village isolates which prevent a coherent Northern or Southern identity from forming. During the Deng Xiaoping reforms of the 1980s, South China developed much more quickly than North China, leading some scholars to wonder whether the economic fault line would create political tension between north and south. Some of this was based on the idea that there would be conflict between the bureaucratic north and the commercial south. This has not occurred to the degree feared, in part because the economic fault lines eventually created divisions between coastal China and the interior, as well as between urban and rural China, which run in different directions from the north‚Äìsouth division, and in part because neither north or south has any type of obvious advantage within the Chinese central government. In addition there are other cultural divisions that exist within and across the north‚Äìsouth dichotomy.  Stereotypes and differences Nevertheless, the concepts of North and South continue to play an important role in regional stereotypes. \\"Northerners\\" are seen as: * Taller.

(Ames et al., p. 61) The Late Holocene contains four cultural periods: the Early Kachemak, the Late Kachemak, the Koniag, and the Alutiiq. Each period will be broken down by time period, also including the significance of each. # Early Kachemak (1850 BC - 500 BC) = The period is marked by the shift in mobility patterns: residential foragers to logistical collectors. Dwellings were small in size. Technology and subsistence activities were made more efficient. More efficient ways of processing food were introduced. Material remains include toggling harpoons, netweights, ground slate points, nets, ulus (chopping knife). The Ocean Bay people were the first to inhabit the area. They were considered to be a maritime people, but exploited both marine and terrestrial resources, including mammals and fish. Their only hunting kit included hooks, lines, harpoons, and lances with chipped stone points. By the Middle Holocene, more specialized tool kits were introduced. Originally living in small, dispersed settlements, the small 2-3m tents were replaced by small pit houses around 2000 BC. # Late Kachemak (500 BC - 1200 AD) = The period is marked by large populations. Logistical patterns of mobility kept increasing, and community sizes increased, having up to ten dwellings. Storage facilities are also introduced. Mortuary practices are considered to be elaborate, and the finding of labrets suggest that social differentiation increased. Craft specialization increased as well. # Koniag (1200 AD - European contact) = The population reached its peak. Houses and settlement sizes continued to increase, suggesting the development of social ranking. Architecture started to become more elaborate and storage features kept increasing in size. Shift in location toward the coast suggests better access to marine resources, specifically to whales. \\"There is also evidence of intensified salmon fishing, food production and processing specializations, exchange, and investment in carpentry\\". (Ames et al., p. 62) # Alutiiq (Modern) = These islands are the original or traditional homes of the Alutiiqu (previously Koniag) peoples. The coastal environment provided excellent productivity for these people, as the terrestrial environment seemed somewhat low or lacked natural resources.

K. Tolstoy () ( ‚Äì ), was a Russian poet, novelist, and playwright, considered to be the most important nineteenth-century Russian historical dramatist, primarily on account of the strength of his dramatic trilogy The Death of Ivan the Terrible (1866), Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich (1868), and Tsar Boris (1870). He also gained fame for his satirical works, published under his own name (History of the Russian State from Gostomysl to Timashev, The Dream of Councillor Popov) and under the collaborational pen name of Kozma Prutkov. His fictional works include the novella The Family of the Vourdalak, The Vampire (1841), and the historical novel Prince Serebrenni (1862). Aleksey was a member of the Tolstoy family, and a second cousin of Leo Tolstoy. Due to his mother's closeness with the court of the Tsar, Aleksey was admitted to the future Alexander II's childhood entourage and became \\"a comrade in games\\" for the young Crown Prince. As a young man Tolstoy traveled widely, including trips to Italy and Germany, where he met Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Tolstoy began his education at home under the tutelage of his uncle the writer Antony Pogorelsky, under whose influence he first became interested in writing poetry, and a number of other teachers. In 1834 Tolstoy enrolled in the Moscow Foreign Ministry State Archive as a student. In December 1835 he completed exams (in English, French and German languages and literature, Latin, World and Russian history, and Russian statistics) at the University of Moscow. Throughout the 1840s Tolstoy led a busy high society life, full of pleasure trips, salon parties and balls, hunting sprees and fleeting romances. He also spent many years in state service as a bureaucrat and diplomat. In 1856, on the day of his Coronation, Alexander II appointed Tolstoy one of his personal aide-de-adjutants. Tolstoy served as an infantry major in the Crimean War. He eventually left state service in the early 1860s to pursue his literary career. He died in 1875 of a self-administered lethal dose of morphine at his Krasny Rog estate in the Chernigov Governorate. Biography =Early life= Alexey Konstantinovich Tolstoy was born in Saint Petersburg to the famed family of Tolstoy. His father, Count Konstantin Petrovich Tolstoy (1780‚Äì1870), a son of the army general, was a Russian state assignation bank councilor. His mother, Anna Alekseyevna Perovskaya (1796‚Äì1857), was an illegitimate daughter of Count Aleksey Kirillovich Razumovsky (1784‚Äì1822), an heir of the legendary Ukrainian hetman Alexey Razumovsky. A. K. Tolstoy's uncle (on his father's side) was Fyodor Tolstoy (1783‚Äì1873). His uncle on his mother's side was Aleksey Perovsky (1787‚Äì1836), an author known under the pen name of Antony Pogorelsky. Aleksey Konstantinovich was a second cousin of Leo Tolstoy; Count Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy was their common great-grandfather. Konstantin Tolstoy and Anna Perovskaya's marriage was short-lived; they divorced in October 1817. With her six weeks old son, Anna moved first to her own Blistava estate in Chernigov Governorate, then to Krasny Rog, an estate belonging to her brother Aleksey Perovsky, who became Aleksey Konstantinovich's tutor and a long-time companion. Common knowledge has it that Pogorelsky's famous fantasy fairytale The Black Chicken or The People of the Underground was premiered at home, his young nephew being the only member of Pogorelsky's audience. It was under the latter's influence that Aleksey started to write poetry, as early as 1823, inspired by some old books he found at home. Aleksey had good teachers and at the age of six he fluently spoke French, German and English. Later he learned Italian as well. As for the Tolstoys, Anna Perovskaya stopped seeing them altogether, only sending them postcards on major dates and holidays. Remembering those happy years, Aleksey later wrote: In early 1826 Anna Perovskaya returned to Saint Petersburg with her brother and son. Here, due to his mother's closeness with the court of the Tsar, Aleksey was admitted to the future Tsar Alexander II's childhood entourage and in August became what was officially termed \\"a comrade in games\\" for the young Crown Prince. Aleksey's duties were not many: he had to visit the Crown Prince in Saint Petersburg and Tsarskoye Selo, take walks with him on Yelagin Island and participate in games, many of which were, in effect, small scale military exercises. They became friends and this friendship lasted for several decades, ending in the mid-1860s.McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama, Vol 1. In autumn of 1826 Aleksey met Aleksander Pushkin for the first time. In summer 1827 the family visited Germany where in Weimar young Aleksey met Goethe. The great man greeted the boy very warmly and left him a fragment of a mammoth tusk with his own drawing (depicting a frigate) on it, for a present. Aleksey, having been awe-stricken, remembered little: \\"Only his magnificent features and the way he took me upon his lap,\\" according to his autobiography.–ê.–ö. Tolstoy. Works in 4 volumes. Moscow. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura publishers. 1964. Vol. 4. Diaries and Letters. No. 274. A letter to A.Gubernatis (translated from French). Pp. 422‚Äì428. The family spent the next ten years in continuous travel, both in Russia and abroad. An 1831 trip to Italy especially impressed the 13-year-old. \\"Back in Russia I fell into a deep nostalgic depression, longing for Italy which felt like a real motherland; desperately mourning the loss, I cried at night when my dreams carried me off to this Paradise lost,\\" he wrote in his autobiography decades later. In Italy the family met Karl Bryullov. On May 10, 1831, Aleksey wrote in his diary: \\"Bryullov dined with us and left a sketch in my album.\\" The painter promised Perovsky to make portraits of all three of them once he was back in Russia, but five years later he had finished only one, that of his nephew.Dmitry Zhukov, the author of Tolstoy's comprehensive biography, humorously described the way Perovsky and Pushkin were in rivalry over Bryullov's attention (the latter wanted to have the \\"Natalie\\" portrait) and how the artist, locked inside Perovsky‚Äôs house, got sick of working on his host's portrait and had to escape. =Career= In 1834 Tolstoy enrolled in the Moscow Foreign Ministry State Archive as a \\"student\\", where he got his first taste of working with real historical documents. In December 1835 he completed exams (in English, French and German languages and literature, Latin, World and Russian history, and Russian statistics) at the University of Moscow for the formal 1st Grade State Bureaucrat certificate. He soon embarked on a career in the Economic Affairs and Statistics Department in Saint Petersburg. Before that, in July 1835, he had buried his uncle Aleksey Perovsky (who died in Warsaw of tuberculosis) and had become heir to his Krasny Rog estate. Also in 1835 Aleksey showed some of his new poems to Vasily Zhukovsky, who praised them. There's evidence that Pushkin also approved of the young poet's early works, giving him full moral support. Tolstoy wrote a lot, refining his technique, but wasn't eager to get published. \\"My first experiments were, no doubt, absurd, but at least metrically they were flawless. I went on training thus for many years, before I debuted... as a prose writer, not a poet,\\" he remembered later. In the late 1830s Tolstoy developed a passion for hunting which he himself described as bizarre. \\"While serving at the Court of Tsar Nikolai I, and leading a most fashionable life which in a way appealed to me, I still used to run away (from the Palace) and spend weeks in the forests, occasionally with friends, but more often than not, alone. Submerging myself headlong into such a life, which corresponded as little with my artistic inclinations as it did with my official position in Court, I got quite a reputation among our best shooters as a bear-hunter! This hobby, I think, somehow affected my poetry which has always had a rather upbeat quality.\\" ‚Äì From his 1874 autobiography. In January 1837 Tolstoy became attached to the Russian Embassy in Frankfurt where he spent the next two years. The assignment was rather formal; it did not demand Tolstoy's presence in Germany and he spent most of his time in Saint Petersburg, leading a merry life, spending up to three thousand rubles per month, often traveling to Italy and France. It was during one of these visits that he wrote his first two \\"gothic\\" novellas ‚Äì The Family of the Vourdalak and Three Hundred Years On (originally in German, later translated into Russian by Boleslav Markevich).In French, according to I. Yampolsky's biography. Tolstoy showed great interest in all things macabre, influenced, again, by his late uncle who \\"was obsessed with mysticism in every possible form\\" and who, in turn, was influenced by E. T. A. Hoffmann whom he was personally acquainted with. In late 1840 Tolstoy was transferred back to Russia to a position in the Tsar's Imperial State Chancellery 2nd Department where he continued to work for many years, slowly rising in the hierarchy. As time went by, though, he showed less and less enthusiasm, for the demands of his position had come to feel like a major hindrance to his literary aspirations. In May 1841 Tolstoy debuted with The Vampire (a novella published under the pen name of \\"Krasnorogsky\\", a reference to Krasny Rog, his residence). Complicated in structure, multi-layered and rich in counterpoints, featuring both the element of \\"horror\\" and political satire, it instantly caught the attention of Vissarion Belinsky who praised its \\"obviously still very young, but undoubtedly gifted author,\\" totally unaware of the latter's real identity. Tolstoy himself saw the story as insignificant and made no attempt to include it in any of the subsequent compilations; it was only in 1900 that The Vampire was re-issued. In the autumn of 1843 Tolstoy debuted as a poet: his poem \\"Serebryanka\\" was published in the No.40 edition of Listok Dlya Svetskikh Lyudey (The Paper for Fashionable People). It took another two years for him to see his second short story, \\"Artyomy Semyonovich Bervenkovsky\\", a homage to the so-called 'natural school' apparently written under the influence of Nikolai Gogol's Dead Souls, published in the 1st volume of Count Vladimir Sollogub's Yesterday and Today almanac.Yesterday and Today anthology. Compiled by Count Vladimir Sollogub. Book 1. Saint Petersburg, 1845 The 2nd volume featured Amena, a novella, described as an extract from a novel called Stebelovsky which remained unfinished. Belinsky responded negatively to this publication, describing the piece as \\"rather dull\\", and an \\"unfortunate manifestation of mental irritation picked from Chateaubriand\\" (meaning apparently Les Martyrs, 1809).The Complete Works by V.G.Belinsky. Moscow. 1955. p.587 Throughout the 1840s Tolstoy led a busy high society life, full of pleasure trips, salon parties and balls, hunting sprees and fleeting romances. He was described as \\"a handsome young man with blonde hair and a freshly coloured face\\" and was renowned for his physical strength, \\"bending spoons, forks and horse-shoes and driving nails into walls with one finger.\\" One notable business trip to Kaluga in 1850 led to a close friendship with Nikolai Gogol (whom he first met in Frankfurt and then in Rome). Tolstoy recited to Gogol many of his yet unpublished poems and fragments from what later became the novel Prince Serebryany. Gogol read him the second part of his novel Dead Souls. Among other friendships he struck up in the forties were those with Ivan Aksakov, Pavel Annenkov, Nikolai Nekrasov, Ivan Panaev and Ivan Turgenev. In the early 1850s, in collaboration with the Zhemchuzhnikov brothers, Tolstoy created the fictional writer Kozma Prutkov, a petty bureaucrat with great self-esteem who parodied the poetry of the day and soon became famous for his utterly banal aphorisms. In 1851 Prutkov debuted with The Fantasy a comedy which was signed \\"Y\\" and \\"Z\\" and written by Tolstoy and Aleksey Zhemchuzhnikov. The play, mocking the then popular \\"nonsense\\" vaudeville premiered on January 8 in the Alexandrinsky Theatre. This spectacular farce (featuring at one point a dozen small dogs running about on stage) caused a huge scandal, was promptly banned by Nikolay I (who was among the audience) and remained unpublished until 1884. It was also in 1851 that Tolstoy first met Sophia Andreyevna Miller (1827?‚Äì1892), the wife of a cavalry colonel (whom she later divorced with great difficulty) and an impressively well-educated woman who knew fourteen languages, at a Bolshoy Theater masquerade. Tolstoy fell in love with her but had to wait for another twelve years before they were able to marry. Miller had, apparently, a perfect artistic taste and Tolstoy later referred to her as his harshest and most objective critic, as well as the best friend he'd ever had. All of his love lyrics from 1851 onwards were written for and about Sophia. Many of his poems (\\"My dear bluebells\\", \\"Amidst the ball uproar\\", \\"Brighter than the skylark's singing\\", \\"The wind from high up, it is not...\\") have been set to music by renowned composers and have become famous Russian romances. In 1854 Sovremennik magazine published several of Tolstoy's verses (\\"My bluebells\\", \\"Oh you haystacks...\\" and others), which instantly got critics talking, and also the first of Kozma Prutkov's humorously pompous poetic exercises. The latter was not so much a collective pseudonym, as a character who was making quite a point of coming across as a \\"real\\" creature, performing, among other things, obnoxious pranks, one of which involved a messenger visiting all the leading Saint Petersburg architects late at night with the urgent news of the Isaakiyevsky Cathedral having fallen down and urging them to appear early next morning at the court of Tsar Nikolay I, which they hastily did, to the Tsar's utter annoyance. As the Crimea War broke out, Tolstoy's first intention was to gather a partisan fighting unit and lead it to the Baltic Sea, should the English decide to land there. Along with Count Aleksey Bobrinsky (future Minister of transport) he started to finance and equip two partisan squads, forty fighters each. He bought some ammunition from Tula and traveled all along the Baltic coastline, examining what was supposed to be his future theater of war, the Crown Prince being totally unaware of his plans. On 2 September the allies landed at Yevpatoria and Tolstoy headed South, to join the Imperial infantry regiment (under the command of Lev Perovsky, another of his uncles) as an army major, in March 1855. The regiment went only as far as Odessa where a thousand men were lost from typhoid. In February 1856 Tolstoy became one of the casualties. In Odessa he was nursed back to health by Sophia Miller. Alexander II was telegraphed daily on the subject of his old friend's condition, at his personal request. In May 1855 Tolstoy was back on his feet, but the war was over for him; he instead embarked upon a Crimean journey with Sophia. After the War, in 1856, on the day of his Coronation, Alexander II appointed Tolstoy as one of his personal aide-de-camp. It was only three years later that Tolstoy managed to get rid of this tiresome privilege which implied regular duties in the Palace, interfering with his now burgeoning literary career. \\"You cannot imagine what a storm of rhymes rages in me, what waves of poetry are sweeping through me, longing to break free,\\" he wrote in a letter to Sophia Miller. Two thirds of Tolstoy's poetic legacy was created in the late 1850s. 1857 saw the publication of a large poem called The Sinner. It was followed by the more significant Ioann Damaskin, first published in Russkaya Beseda January 1859 issue. The poem, dealing with the nature of poetry and the poet's position in society, but also hinting at the author's personal plight, caused scandal. The head of the 3rd Department Prince Vasily Dolgorukov ordered the printing of the magazine to be stopped and for the poem to be removed.Yampolsky, Igor. Works by A.K.Tolstoy in 4 Volumes. 1964. Vol.1. Commentaries. P.774. The Minister of Education Evgraf Kovalevsky personally permitted the publication, his rather daring decision causing a serious rift between the two departments.The Central State Archives, Leningrad/ The Chief Censorship Department file, 1859, No.152130.Dolgorukov, N.V., The Petersburg Sketches, 1934, Pp.178‚Äì179. Tolstoy's poems were appearing in virtually all the major Russian magazines of the time, regardless of their ideological inclinations. Yet, in 1857 his relationship with the leftist Sovremennik group became strained. Tolstoy drifted towards the Slavophiles and their Russkaya Beseda magazine, becoming a close friend of Ivan Aksakov and Aleksey Khomyakov, but this liaison was short-lived too. In the 1860s he found himself in a strange position of being a highly popular author, criticized fiercely both from the left and from the right. As to the reasons for this, A.K. Tolstoy was never in doubt. In an autobiographical letter to Angelo de Gubernatis he wrote: Tolstoy caused much controversy with his scathing remarks aimed at contemporary government officials (Alexander Timashev, Vladimir Butkov, Ivan Veillot) whom he ‚Äì a supporter of the monarch ‚Äì considered real enemies of the State. He also criticized the activities of the 3rd Department, and in the wake of the Polish uprising was one of the very few people in the Court to openly denounce Muravyov the Hangman's draconian methods of political repression.Yampolsky, Igor. Works by A.K.Tolstoy in 4 Volumes. 1964. Vol.1. Commentaries. P.14-15. A fierce opponent of xenophobia, he saw Russia as a European country, and Russians as Europeans. This clashed with the Slavophile doctrine of maintaining Russia's \\"special place\\" in the world. \\"[Speaking] of slavophiles, Khomyakov sickens me when he places [Russia] above the West just on the strength of our being Orthodox,\\" Tolstoy wrote in a letter. All the while, well-publicized was his dispute with Turgenev, who saw the French state as Russia's potential guiding light. \\"What France is moving towards is the dictatorship of mediocrity,\\" Tolstoy argued. Being neither a westernizer nor a slavophile, Tolstoy annoyed both parties by his infatuation with pre-Tatar Russian society which he idealized whole-heartedly, seeing it as an Eastern strain of European knighthood, based on the cult of the nobleman. Also causing controversy were Tolstoy's critique of the West's amoral pragmatism and socialist ideas, his dismissal of the Russian imperial ideals which he saw as tragically flawed, and his own doctrine of a centralized Russia, the vile Moscovia State being, in his view, at the root of all Russian political evil. This eclectic \\"political romanticism\\" appeared to be in conflict with every political and social trend of the time. Tolstoy rejected some ecclesiastical teachings, calling them the \\"church's argo\\" and believed in God as a \\"higher being\\" and cosmic mind. \\"I believe God gave us the power of emotion so we could go further than our mind leads us. As a leading force, human emotion is preferable to a thought, just as music is more perfect than a spoken word,\\" he wrote. 1861‚Äì1875 House of Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy at Krasny Rog In 1861 Tolstoy quit the Court. \\"For quite some time I was under the illusion that I'd be able to suppress my artistic nature but life taught me different; this struggle was futile. Service and the arts are incompatible,\\" he wrote in a letter to disappointed Alexander II. \\"Tolstoy represented a rare type of man who not only evaded by every possible means the favours and laurels that came his way, but had to go through painfully tedious battles with people who, driven by the best of intentions, were imposing every opportunity of making a brilliant career on him,\\" wrote literary historian and BEED biographer Semyon Vengerov in 1903. From then on the writer's visits to the Palace became rare, but he used each one as an opportunity to \\"speak the truth regardless,\\" as he put it. In 1862 Tolstoy solicited for Ivan Aksakov who'd been banned from editing his Den (The Day) newspaper. A year later he helped Ivan Turgenev out of an exile the latter found himself in after having contacted the \\"London propagandists\\", as Alexander Herzen and Nikolay Ogarev were then known. In 1864 Tolstoy tried to exert his influence upon Alexander II to make him alleviate the plight of the imprisoned Chernyshevsky. Asked by the Tsar for the latest news in the world of literature, Tolstoy said: \\"The whole of Russia has gone into mourning for Chernyshevsky to whom an injustice has been done...\\" - \\"No, Tolstoy, I beg you never to remind me of Chernyshevsky, please,\\" the monarch hastily retorted. This aborted conversation, as it happened, brought to an end a friendship that had lasted for forty years. Tolstoy's historical novel Prince Serebrenni (1862, Russky Vestnik), set during the time of Ivan the Terrible, was widely popular and was translated into many languages. The novel premiered at a recital evening in the Palace, and brought its author a book-trinket from the Empress consort Maria Aleksandrovna, who greatly admired Tolstoy, both as writer and a person. His poetic drama Don Juan, published the same year, was less successful: even if not officially banned, it wasn't staged in its author's lifetime and made its theatrical debut only in 1905, severely cut by censors. Kozma Prutkov aside, Tolstoy wrote satirical verses under his own name, the best known of which was the Karamzin-inspired History of the Russian State from Gostomysl to Timashev (1868), a parody on Russian history that focused on the vicious characteristics of Russian monarchs. Another satirical poem, The Dream of Councillor Popov, written in the summer of 1873, spread across Russia in hand- written form and became hugely popular. Both Leo Tolstoy and Ivan Turgenev expressed their delight at this personal swipe at the Interior Minister Pyotr Valuyev, and a mockery in general of a conservative bureaucrat trying to come across as a liberal. The poem came out in 1878, in Berlin, as a brochure, then six years later was reprinted by Russkaya Starina (No.12, 1884).Yampolsky, Igor. Works by A.K.Tolstoy in 4 Volumes. 1964. Vol.1. Commentaries. P.768. 1867 saw the release of Poems, the vast collection of Tolstoy's verse (all in all, 131 pieces), the only such compilation published in his lifetime. Tolstoy's lasting contribution to Russian literature was a trilogy of historical dramas (modelled after Alexander Pushkin's Boris Godunov): The Death of Ivan the Terrible, Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich, and Tsar Boris.Dracula's Guest, ed. Michael Sims: Walker & Company, 2010), p.136. The Death of Ivan the Terrible, published in 1866 in Otechestvennye Zapiski magazine, was staged the following year in Saint Petersburg, Moscow, and some provincial theaters and enjoyed massive success, but after 1870 was virtually banned and got revived on stage only in the late 1890s. Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich (1868, Vestnik Evropy) was banned from being produced on stage personally by Interior minister Timashev; as late as 1907 censors deemed the play \\"inappropriate.\\" Tsar Boris (1870, Vestnik Evropy) received no official ban, but the Directorial council of the Imperial Theatres refused to sanction its production. In 1871 Tolstoy started his fifth and final play called Posadnik (set in the times when the Novgorod Republic prospered), which remained unfinished. Parts of it were published in Skladchina, an 1874 charity almanac, the rest appeared in Vestnik Evropy in 1876, after the author's death.Yampolsky, Igor. Works by A.K.Tolstoy in 4 Volumes. 1964. Vol.2. Commentaries. P.680-682. =Later life= Tolstoy in his later years. Portrait by Ilya Repin, 1896. Tolstoy was lenient land-owner, admired by his Krasny Rog peasants who were permitted to use his fields as common pastures and given free timber and primary education for their children in a school he built for them in 1859. In 1861 he personally gathered all of his peasants together, read them the Emancipation reform of 1861 decree, gave money to everybody present and participated in the grandiose drinking spree that followed. Being a lavish spender and having no knowledge of the practical side of life, by the end of the 1860s he found himself on the verge of bankruptcy, but loathed the idea of returning to the Tsar's Court. Ever since the mid-1860s Tolstoy had fallen more and more out of sync with Russian cultural life, feeling acutely his ideological and spiritual isolation. Referring to himself as an 'anchorite', he spent most of his time in Pustynka (near Saint Petersburg) and his Krasny Rog estate, worsening financial situation and deteriorating health adding to his troubles. Tired of fighting his many opponents, totally disillusioned with what he saw around him, A. K. Tolstoy wrote to his friend Boleslav Markevich in 1869: A.K.Tolstoy entered the 1870s as a very sick man, suffering from asthma, angina pectoris, neuralgias and severe headaches. Regular visits to European medics only temporarily alleviated his conditions. In the spring of 1875 Tolstoy started taking morphine. \\"Now I'm feeling much better, at least the neuralgia's gone. But never before have I been so short of breath. Asthma fits are continuous,\\" he complained in a letter to poet Karolina Pavlova (who was also a translator of his dramas) on 8 July 1875.Yampolsky, Igor. Works by A.K.Tolstoy in 4 Volumes. 1964. Vol.4. Letters and diaries. A letter to Karolina Pavlova, July 8, 1875. P. 451. Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy died on September 28, 1875, in Krasny Rog, Chernigov Governorate, after having given himself a lethal injection of morphine. He was buried in the family vault in the Uspenskaya Church in Krasny Rog.  Legacy  The monument to A. K. Tolstoy at the Krasny Rog estate Tolstoy represented the later period of Romanticism in Russian literature; art for him was a mystic link between the human world and the higher spheres where \\"eternal ideas dwell.\\" Along with Afanasy Fet, his artistic and spiritual ally, he saw Art as a higher science, man's only instrument for a true and comprehensive understanding of the world. Romantic tendencies were best realised in Tolstoy's poetry and in some of his dramas, notably Don Juan where the hero is on quest for a romantic ideal, looking everywhere for love \\"that helps one penetrate into the wonderful universal laws, our world's hidden beginnings,\\" as he put it. \\"Art can only be a 'means' ‚Äì all of the 'ends'... it contains in itself,\\" Tolstoy wrote in 1870, in the course of long dispute with those whom he labeled \\"utilitarianists in literature\\".Letter to Markevich, January 11, 1870. Works by A.K.Tolstoy in 4 Volumes. 1964. Vol.4 Pp.342‚Äì43 Such views automatically made him a \\"conservative\\" in the eyes of the revolutionary democrats who formed a large majority in the Russian literary circles of the 1850s and 1860s. Unlike Fet, though, Tolstoy insisted on the artist's total independence from ideology and politics, and felt himself totally free to criticize and mock authorities, a trait that snubbed many people in high places. Tolstoy's poetry had certain qualities that made it unusual and even unique, one being the \\"half-spoken\\" nature of the verse. \\"It's good for poetry when a thought is only half-fulfilled, so that readers can complete it ‚Äì each in their own way,\\" he explained in a letter to Sophia Miller in 1854. This view translated into a technique of writing. One of the things Tolstoy was criticized and even jeered for were \\"bad rhymes\\" which he used consciously, as part of his \\"poetic system\\". \\"Imperfect rhyming, if kept in bounds of course, can be seen as corresponding to the Venetian school in painting which with little imperfections, or should I say, carelessnesses, could achieve the kind of effects which Raphael wouldn't dream of for all of his precision,\\" Tolstoy wrote in 1859. In fact, Tolstoy, as I. Yampolsky pointed out, was a master of versification. Consciously imposed \\"careless\\" rhyming gave his poems an improvisational tone (with \\"an impression of thoughts being put to paper exactly in the form they were born\\") but behind it there was hard work and much editing. \\"Tolstoy's verse is so simple it hardly rises above prose, yet the poetic impression it carries is perfectly full,\\" critic Nikolay Strakhov wrote in 1867.Critical Notes. Otechestvennye Zapiski. 1867, No.6, p.131. Another unusual feature of Tolstoy's poems was the fact that, while rather salon-like and graceful both in nature and form, they were full of 'simplistic' bits borrowed freely from common talk and traditional Russian folklore. Kept in perfect balance, these tinged his verse with a peculiar, musical quality. More than half of Tolstoy's poems have been put to music by leading Russian composers like Tchaykovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Musorgsky, Mily Balakirev, Cesar Cui, Anton Rubinstein, Sergey Rakhmaninov and others. \\"Tolstoy is the unfathomable well of poems crying for music. For me he is one of the most attractive poets,\\" wrote Tchaykovsky.Tchaykovsky, P.I. Correspondence with N.F. Von Mekk, Vol.2, 1935, P.360. Assessing Tolstoy's poetry as a whole, D.S.Mirsky wrote: \\"Even if they suffer from sentimentality and are occasionally banal, his lyrics retain their freshness and even now taste like a delightful morning dew,\\" the critic wrote. Innokenty Annensky saw Tolstoy's poetry as being the perfect expression of \\"pure love\\", the \\"human soul's inner beauty\\" being the poet's ideal. \\"Tolstoy never wrote for children but his crystal clear idealism, tinged with mysticism, made his poetry resonate well with the period in adolescence when the human soul reaches out to something high and indescribable,\\" Annensky wrote. Mentioning Nekrasov, who in his latter works created a strong image of the Russian mother, Annensky argued that what Tolstoy managed to create was an equally sublime portrait of the noble woman whose \\"serene placidity belies unspeakable sadness‚Ä¶ of the one who's ashamed of her own happiness fearing that she, making the most of this world's beauty, somehow takes it away from those who have no opportunity to enjoy such riches in abundance.\\" \\"His idea that 'violence and suppression of free thought were contrary to God's will' was not just a pretty phrase but an innermost conviction. For he was indeed a noble man\\". ‚Äì Yuly Aykhenvald. Tolstoy's ballads and songs were close to traditional bylinas both in essence and form; in fact, the author himself made no distinction between the two genres. Critics argued that (unlike, say, Nekrasov) Tolstoy used folklorisms as a mere stylistic instrument, using stories from the history of the Russian Middle Ages as a means to convey his own ideas and theories (Zmei Tugarin), and to link historical utopias with relevant social comment (Boryvoi, Vasily Shibanov). Tolstoy tended to greatly idealise Russia's pre-Mongol past which made the traditional bylina characters almost superheroes. \\"It's hard to recognize Alyosha Popovich, eyes-a-jealous, hands-a-grabbin'- as a romantic youth, speaking of love and devotion to his beloved,\\" Semyon Vengerov remarked. Likewise, the fearsome Ilya Muromets who came across as a rather violent, dangerous and often sacrilegious type in folk bylinas, was portrayed by Tolstoy as a \\"benign grandfather figure,\\" rather gracious and well-spoken. Critic Yuly Aykhenvald derided Tolstoy's insistence on continuing with his \\"nationalistic masquerade\\" and quoted Anton Chekhov as commenting: \\"[Tolstoy] has put the opera costume on and forgotten to take it off before leaving the theatre.\\" According to Aykhenvald, Tolstoy failed to see that \\"the national values, when taken to the extreme, become alien-looking.\\" For Aykhenvald, though, it was Tolstoy's humour that prevented him from turning into an \\"archeology worshipper\\". The critic saw Tolstoy's romanticism as universal and in a certain way religious (resulting in the fact that his most memorable character, Tsar Fyodor was \\"an epitome of Christian meekness and grace\\"). Yet, \\"[Tolstoy] worshipped that kind of God who was devoid of stiffness... he was a free spirit and valued freedom most.\\" Tolstoy's sense of humour was best realised in Kozma Prutkov's extraordinary aphorisms, as well as in his own satirical poems. \\"Tolstoy... without any doubt, is Russia's greatest absurdist poet,\\" wrote Mirsky. The Dream of Councillor Popov and History of the Russian State from Gostomysl to Timashev, his best known satires, were spread across Russia in manuscript, gaining huge popularity amongst all social strata. According to Mirsky, The Dream is \\"the acme of Russian humorous poetry, mixing sharp, poignant satire... and pure delight in cheerful absurdity\\". It's The Dream that can be seen as Aleksey Tolstoy's most solid claim for immortality,\\" the critic argued, mentioning The Uproar in the Vatican as another of his humorous masterpieces. Tolstoy's anti-leftist, pro-conservative sarcasm, on the other hand, received much stick from the 'democratic' press. His \\"Ballad With a Tendency\\" was bitterly criticised by Saltykov-SchedrinOtechestvennye Zapiski, 1872, No.2, —Ä. 286 while Iskra magazine parodied it in 1872 with a verse entitled \\"A Ballad with a Pro-Police Tendency\\".Iskra (The Spark) magazine, 1872, No., Pp.120‚Äì121. Shchedrin, describing the current state of Russian literature as a \\"kingdom of scoundrels\\", in a letter to Aleksey Zhemchuzhnikov wrote: \\"Add to all this the fun-and-games-seeking 'free artists' like Count A. K. Tolstoy who makes... our obscurantists' hearts beat faster with delight. I don't know about you, but I find it painful to see how people whom I though honest, even if not very far-seeing, fight on the side of obscurantism, employing pseudo-folklorism as a weapon.\\"The Complete Works of –ú.–ï.Saltykov-Shchedrin. 1937. Vol.XVIII. Pp. 244‚Äì245. Tolstoy was a master of prose; both his novella The Vampire (praised by Vissarion Belinsky)The Complete A.K.Tolstoy, Vol.V. 1954, pp.473‚Äì474 and his novel Prince Serebrenni received a lot of good press. The latter, though, was criticised for being tendentious; many argued that both the main character and Yelena Morozova looked very much like people of the 19th, rather than 16th century. On the other hand, Ivan Grozny and the oprichnina horrors were depicted with great vividness and passion; the novel's masterfully built structure, its rich musical language made it a perfect Walter Scott-type of book for adolescents, according to Vengerov. \\"The novel is highly involving‚Ä¶ finely structured and well-written,\\" Ivan Turgenev wrote, recommending it to a French publisher.M.Parturier. Une amitie litterature, Paris, 1952, p.151. Still, as a prosaic Tolstoy made much less of an impact than as a poet. He‚Äôs been lauded as a classic of the 19th century Russian historical drama. D. S. Mirsky regarded Tolstoy as a dramatist superior to Aleksander Ostrovsky, describing his plays as \\"full of intriguing ideas and brilliantly crafted characters. They impress us with intelligence and insight rather than with flights of imagination, but in Tsar Fyodor Tolstoy managed to create one of the most interesting characters in Russian literature: that of a kind and weak ruler who has a keen sense of justice but is unable to make his evil aids implement his good will.\\" A scene from Act V of Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich Critics noted, though, that history as such was secondary to Tolstoy; he was driven mostly by his own personal views and feelings, tending to judge his 16th century characters using mid-19th century moral values. \\"The life of today seeps through everywhere,\\" Tolstoy himself admitted, speaking of his ballads. According to the author, historical drama had to be \\"true\\" only in a \\"humanist way\\". \\"A poet... has just one responsibility: to his own poetic self... human truth is his one law. Historical truth is something he is not bound to. If it fits into the concept, very good, if not, he can easily do without it,\\" he wrote.Tolstoy, –ê.–ö.

So on the one hand, Tolstoy's dramatic trilogy- The Death of Ivan the Terrible, Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich and Tsar Boris- was not historical in the strict sense of the word; on the other hand, it was far from being the brand of \\"patriotic drama\\" produced by Nestor Kukolnik or the imitation of the French tragedie des allusions which Aleksander Pushkin ridiculed. In fact, Pushkin's attitude was the closest approximation to that of Tolstoy. The latter's plays had their \\"second levels\\", directly corresponding to contemporary political situations, but were driven mostly by the author's historical views and theories which involved the glorifying of Russian \\"noble men\\" (he associated them with the boyarstvo) and the vilification Ivan Grozny whom the boyarstvo had fallen victim to. Pavel Annenkov considered Ioann and Fyodor as \\"loosely based upon\\" characters, being perfectly fine but only in representing their era, not their own historical selves. \\"They are as loose as King Lear or Hamlet were and, if they do belong more to Russian history than those two belong to English history, that is because no other reality than that of our Old Russia could have inspired [Tolstoy] in such a way, bringing him such colors, such an essence to freely draw from,\\"...–û–Ω–∏ —Å—Ç–æ–ª—å –∂–µ —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è, –∫–∞–∫, –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä, –∫–æ—Ä–æ–ª—å –õ–∏—Ä –∏–ª–∏ –ì–∞–º–ª–µ—Ç, –∏ –µ—Å–ª–∏ –≥–æ—Ä–∞–∑–¥–æ –±–æ–ª–µ–µ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–∞–¥–ª–µ–∂–∞—Ç —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏, —á–µ–º —Ç–µ ‚Äì –∞–Ω–≥–ª–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –∏–ª–∏ –¥–∞—Ç—Å–∫–æ–π, —Ç–æ –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–¥–∞—Ä—è –æ–¥–Ω–æ–º—É –æ–±—Å—Ç–æ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤—É: –Ω–∏–∫–∞–∫–∞—è –¥—Ä—É–≥–∞—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å, –∫—Ä–æ–º–µ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ–π —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π, –Ω–µ –º–æ–≥–ª–∞ –±—ã –Ω–∞–≤–µ—è—Ç—å –∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ä—É –ø–æ–¥–æ–±–Ω—ã—Ö –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤, –Ω–∏ –∏–∑ –∫–∞–∫–æ–π –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–π –Ω–µ –º–æ–≥ –±—ã –æ–Ω –ø–æ—á–µ—Ä–ø–Ω—É—Ç—å —Ç–∞–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏ —Ç–∞–∫–∏—Ö –∫—Ä–∞—Å–æ–∫ –¥–ª—è —Å–≤–æ–∏—Ö —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–π. ‚Äì Annenkov's original text in Russian. the critic wrote. It was the generic closeness of Tolstoy's plays to the Russia of old, Annenkov argued, that made them historic in the truest sense of the word, for \\"their significance as living testimony to the spirit those people and their times is beyond doubt\\". A. K. Tolstoy's grave in Krasny Rog Common to the trilogy was a somewhat morbid look at the history of the Russian monarchy of the previous three centuries, where, as the author saw it, all the efficient rulers happened to be evil, and all the 'good' ones proved to be inefficient. The three stories of three different historical figures had similarly didactic finales: \\"God help you, Tsar Ivan, and God forgive us all! That's the fate autocracy deserved! Here's the result of our disintegration!\\" (Zakharyin's words over Ivan the Terrible's dead body), \\"I am to blame for all of this... Oh God, why did you make me Tsar?!\\" (Tsar Fyodor), \\"What Evil spawns is only more evil and nothing else.\\" (Boris Godunov). All three parts of the trilogy, which, according to Nestor Kotlyarevsky, were \\"united by the idea of tragedy being intrinsic to Tsarist power in Russia,\\"Kotlyarevsky, Nestor. Ancient Portraits. Saint Petersburg, 1907. P. 354. had serious problems with the censorship. The trilogy continued to divide opinion in Russia up until 1917. Not long before the Revolution, in Alexandrinsky Theatre the public reacted to Tsar Boris in an overtly political fashion. Monarchists applauded Boris Godunov's words, the left \\"supported\\" boyarin Sitsky, seeing in him a fighter of despotism. All three plays became part of the repertoire of the leading Russian and Soviet theaters, notably the Maly Theatre, with stars like Ivan Moskvin, Pavel Olenev, Stepan Kuznetsov and Nikolai Khmelyov in the leading roles. According to I. Yampolsky, Tolstoy the dramatist, even if not on par with Pushkin, was high above his contemporaries; he created complex, multi-dimensional historical figures. \\"In the arts, to be wary of showing weaknesses in your favourite characters is to pay them bad service... Thus one can only succeed in creating faceless dummies whom nobody would believe in,\\" Tolstoy wrote.Diaries, Vol.4, 1928, Pp.73‚Äì74. In the mid-19th century Tolstoy was not taken very seriously, but his reputation started to grow after his death in 1875. Vladimir Korolenko called Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich \\"a gem of Russian drama,\\" that's been shining especially bright next to \\"the totally dismal theater repertoire of the late 19th century\\". Tolstoy was highly valued by Aleksander Blok and Valery Bryusov; Ivan Bunin, otherwise harsh in his comments on fellow writers, rated him very high; Velemir Khlebnikov mentioned him among his all-time favourites and, most surprisingly (according to Korney Chukovsky), Vladimir Mayakovsky knew his poetry by heart and often recited it in public. Both Tolstoy's poetry (the larger part of which has been transformed into classic romance) and his historical drama trilogy are regarded as an intrinsic part of the classic Russian literature of the 19th century.

Career Born in New Mexico, United States, Haines and her family then moved to India where they lived for six years before returning to North America. Her career as a reporter began with CFRB radio in Toronto. In late 1999, she began to work as a fill-in anchor for CTV Newsnet. On 15 January 2000, working a shift for the news channel, Haines made a mistake with a line while taping a report introduction. After regaining her composure, she joked: \\"I kind of like the little stuttering thing. It's like equal opportunity, right? We've got a stuttering newscaster. We've got the black, we've got the Asian, we've got the woman. I could be a lesbian, folk- dancing, black woman stutterer. What's that? In a wheelchair ... with a gimping, rubber legs. Yeah, really. I'd have a successful career, let me tell you\\". However, the camera was still on. Haines retaped the segment, but later that day, a CTV technician mistakenly aired the tape that included the error and the comment. On 17 January, Haines was fired from CTV Newsnet after her comments sparked controversy. The unnamed technician was suspended. Haines was soon hired by Citytv Toronto as a health reporter with CityNews. In fall 2001, she began hosting Health On the Line, which aired on Life Network and Discovery Health for five seasons. On 15 September 2010, Haines returned to Citytv as a senior reporter and anchor.

Moynihan left in 1978, being replaced by singer and accordion-player Tim Lyons; for a short period in 1978 the band toured as a six-piece featuring both Moynihan and Lyons. Their third album, The Mist Covered Mountain, was released in 1980 and featured various older traditional singers. That year, the group had a surprise hit single in Ireland with their instrumental cover of the Beatles' song \\"Hey Jude\\", later re-released on their fourth album, Star-Spangled Molly in 1981; on this album, they were joined by Maura O'Connell. As an indication of their diversity, they also recorded Handel's \\"Arrival of the Queen of Sheba\\", which they jokingly retitled \\"The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba (in Galway)\\", on their 1983 album Song for Ireland. Later, they would also record Bohemian Rhapsody and Jewish klezmer tunes, learned from bluegrass and Klezmer superstar, Andy Statman. When O'Connell left the band, they brought in Mary Black for two albums: Song for Ireland and Anthem. Like O'Connell and Keane before her, Black subsequently went on to explore country, blues and jazz, hopping backwards and forwards between Nashville and Dublin. After Black's departure, Keane returned to the fold for two albums: Anthem and Ballroom. Other singers with the group have included Eleanor Shanley (1988‚Äì1992), Tommy Fleming (1994‚Äì1997) and Andrew Murray (1997‚Äì2000). On the instrumental side, Frankie Gavin and Alec Finn were the only constant members of the group. Jackie Daly (accordion) is a star in his own right and later went on to join the group Patrick Street. He was replaced on accordion in 1983 by Martin O'Connor until 1987, Aidan Coffey until 1995, and Derek Hickey until 2001. The fiddle-accordion-bouzouki combination became synonymous with the inspirational De Dannan instrumental sound. In 1988 Colm Murphy replaced Johnny McDonagh playing the bodhr√°n. The band members went their separate ways in 2003, at which point the name De Dannan was copyrighted by Alec Finn. This led to a high-profile dispute with Frankie Gavin in 2009 when the latter used the name for his pre-existing Hibernian Rhapsody band. In 2008 the original band (Johnny \\"Ringo\\" McDonagh, Charlie Piggott, Dolores Keane, Frankie Gavin and Alec Finn) were commemorated on an Irish 55c postage stamp. Attending the formal issue event, Piggott said, \\"Having contributed to the promotion of Traditional Irish Music and as a keen philatelist, I consider it both an honour and a privilege to be celebrated on an Irish stamp.\\" In 2010 De Danann recorded Wonderwaltz, an album with a line- up of Finn (guitar, bouzouki, tenor guitar, mandola, mouth organ), McDonagh (bodhr√°n, bones), Eleanor Shanley (vocals), Brian McGrath (banjo, piano, tenor guitar, mandola), Derek Hickey (accordion) and Mick Conneely (fiddle, viola, whistle), with guest musicians Cian Finn (backing vocals) and Trevor Hutchinson (double bass).

It was created between 1855 and 1866 by Emperor Napoleon III. The park is next to the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes, a former residence of the Kings of France. It contains an English landscape garden with four lakes; a zoo; an arboretum; a botanical garden; a hippodrome or horse-racing track; a velodrome for bicycle races; and the campus of the French national institute of sports and physical education. The park is known for prostitution after dark. Dimensions The Bois de Vincennes has a total area of 995 hectares (2,459 acres), making it slightly larger than the Bois de Boulogne, (846 hectares / 2,091 acres), the other great Parisian landscape park located at the western side of the city.Dominique Jarrass√©, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, Parigramme 2007. It occupies ten percent of the total area of Paris, and is almost as large as the first six arrondissements in the center of the city combined. The Bois de Vincennes is about three times larger than Central Park in New York City (341 hectares / 843 acres), and is slightly larger than Richmond Park in London (955 hectares / 2,360 acres); but is smaller than Griffith Park in Los Angeles (1,170 hectares / 2891 acres). Only about half of the Bois de Vincennes is covered with trees. File:Map of Bois de Vincennes - OpenStreetMap 1.svgThe Bois de Vincennes, on the eastern edge of the city, is the largest park in Paris. A royal hunting preserve The bois de Vincennes was part of the ancient forest that surrounded the ancient Roman town of Lutetia; at that time it was called Vilcena, the origin of the present name. In about 1150 King Louis VII (11371180) built a hunting lodge at the site of the present chateau. King Philippe-Auguste (11801223) enclosed the forest with a wall, stocked it with game, and began building a castle. King Louis IX, or Saint Louis (12261270) built a chapel next to the castle to house an important religious relic, which he believed to be the crown of thorns from the Crucifixion of Jesus. He was also famous for holding a royal court of justice under an oak near the chateau.http://www.paris.fr/loisirs/paris-au-vert/bois- de-vincennes Official site of the Bois de Vincennes In 1336 King Philip VI of France (12931350) began construction of the imposing donjon of the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes. The work was continued by his successor, Jean II of France (13191364), and finished by Charles V of France (13381380), who surrounded the donjon with a rectangular wall flanked by nine towers. He also began to rebuild the chapel founded by Saint Louis. The new chapel was called La-Sainte Chapelle, modeled after the Saint-Chapelle in the Palais de la Cit√© in Paris. It was not finished until the 16th century.Centre des Monuments Nationaux, Le Guide du patrimoine en France, pg. 337. A hunting party in the forest is shown as the December scene in the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry (1412‚Äì1416), with the towers of the chateau visible in the background. The forest was also the home of a community of monks of the order of the Minimes; their presence is remembered by the name of the Lac des Minimes within the park.Dominique Jarrass√©, pg. 111 In 1654 Cardinal Mazarin commissioned the royal architect Louis Le Vau to build a new palace for King Louis XIV next to the chateau. The new palace featured a pavilion for the King and another for the Queen, separated by a portico and by a wall connected by arcades to the medieval section of the chateau. The donjon had been transformed into prison in the 15th century. The palace was popular with the King for a time, but once Louis XIV established his residence at Versailles, the ch√¢teau of Vincennes was rarely used.Centre des Monuments Nationaux, Le Guide du patrimoine en France, pg. 337. In the 18th century Louis XV (17101774) opened the park to the public, excepting servants in livery. He had hundreds of trees planted and laid out long straight alleys through the forest in the form of intersecting stars. In 1731 he constructed a pyramid-shaped monument to mark the meeting point of the two main alleys, which can still be seen.Dominique Jarrass√©, pg. 111 Image:Vincennes chemise and keep.jpgThe 14th century donjon of the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes, a former royal residence and then a prison, is now open to public.

File:Paris, Bois de Vincennes, Pyramide 02.jpgThe pyramid of the Bois de Vincennes, built by King Louis XV in 1731. He opened the park to the public. The creation of the park Beginning in 1794, large parts of the Bois de Vincennes were turned into a military training ground. Some of the structures of the old chateau were demolished, and a firing range was built. In 184043, a new fort was constructed in the park east of the chateau, and a 166 hectare section of the park was cleared and used for military parades and exercises. In 1854 the Emperor Louis Napoleon, and his new Prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann, decided to transform the Bois de Vincennes into a public park. Haussmann had three major projects for Paris; to improve the traffic circulation of the city, for both practical and military reasons; to build a new system to distribute water and take away sewage; and to create a network of parks and gardens all over the city. The purpose of the park was to provide green space and recreation to the large working-class population of eastern Paris, similar to the Bois de Boulogne, which Louis Napoleon had begun building in 1852 for the more affluent population of the west side of Paris. To build the parks, in 1855 Haussmann created a new Service of Promenades and Plantations, led by an engineer, Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, who was already at work on the Bois de Boulogne. Alphand was a master organizer, the builder of the most famous Paris parks of the 19th century; besides the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, he built the gardens of the Champs-√âlys√©es, the boulevard of the Paris Observatory, Parc Monceau and the Parc des Buttes Chaumont. Alphand stated his philosophy of gardens very clearly in his memoir Les Promenades de Paris: \\"When we say that a garden should preserve a natural appearance, we don't mean that it should be an exact copy of the nature which is around us. A garden is a work of art.\\" While nature and the site gave the general lines, the art consisted of the \\"combinations of forms, colors, and light.\\" Alphand carefully composed his picturesque landscapes out of lawns, groves of trees, flower beds, streams and lakes, visited by taking winding paths.Quotation cited in Jarrass√©, pg. 20. Alphand's task was made much more difficult by the nature of the site. In the center of the park was an enormous military training field, completely cleared of trees. Around the base were firing ranges, a factory for making ammunition, and several forts and redoubts, which occupied large tracts of land. Even after the park was created, the Army continued to build; A new military shooting range was opened in 1860, and a school of pyrotechnics was built in 1864. Alphand solved the problem by annexing addition sections of land at the edges of the park, and by creating three smaller parks around the Bois, each with its own artificial lake and picturesque landscape. Lake Daumesnil, designed like a romantic landscape painting, had two islands, and sloping green lawns. The Lac des Minimes to the north included some of the ruins of the original Medieval monastery that once stood there; and the Lac de Saint-Mandƒó in the southwest completed the park. This last lake was higher in elevation than the others, on the Plateau de Gravelle, and therefore provided water to the other lakes through artificial streams. Trees, lawns and flower beds were planted by Jean- Pierre Barillet-Deschamps, the chief horticulturist of the city, who had landscaped the Bois de Boulogne. Alphand saw that the park had popular attractions and concessions to attract visitors and to help pay for the park. A large hippodrome, or horse-racing track, was built in the southeastern corner of the park, similar to the Longchamps hippodrome at the Bois de Boulogne. There were cafe-restaurants at the different lakes. The park was also decorated with picturesque architecture, mostly designed by Gabriel Davioud, the city architect. His works included the grandstands of the hippodrome and the Temple of Love, a round doric temple which was placed on a promontory on the Isle de Reuilly in Lac Daumesnil, above an artificial grotto. On the same island was a Swiss chalet (taken from the Paris Universal Exposition of 1867), a cafe, a bandstand, and buildings for vendors and game concessions. A swinging suspension bridge connected the two islands in the lake.Jarrass√©, pg. 114‚Äì115 File:Adolphe Alphand Roll Petit Palais PPP00112.jpgJean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, the builder of the Bois de Vincennes, the Bois de Boulogne, and many of the other great parks of Paris.

The park in the 19th and 20th century At the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, most of events took place in the Bois de Vincennes. The Velodrome, which seats forty thousand spectators, was built for the cycling events. The park hosted the first international cricket match between England and France; England unsurprisingly won. In 1899, an experimental tropical garden had been established in the far eastern end of the park, where rubber trees, coffee trees, banana trees and other tropical plants were scientifically studied. In 1907, this garden became the site of the first Colonial Exposition held in Paris, designed to showcase the cultures and products of the French colonies. The exposition featured six villages, complete with inhabitants, from the different parts of the French Empire; an emcampment of Tuaregs from North Africa; a farm from Sudan; a village of Kanaks from New Caledonia; and villages from Madagascar, French Indochina, and the Congo. The Exposition was seen by two million visitors. During the First World War, the Dutch spy Mata Hari was imprisoned in the fortress of Vincennes and executed by firing squad in the moat of the fortress on 15 October 1917. Eyewitnesses reported that her hands were not bound, and that she refused a blindfold. According to the legend (not documented), she is said to have blown a kiss at the firing squad, and to have said, \\"What a strange custom you French have, to shoot people at dawn.\\"Wikisource, Death Comes to Mata Hari (1917), by Henry G. Wales, International News Service, 19 October 1917: concerning the death of the spy Mata Hari. In 1929, the Bois de Vincennes was officially annexed to the city of Paris and included in the city's 12th arrondissement, similar to the Bois de Boulogne which was attached to its 16th arrondissement.

Like the earlier 1907 exposition, It was designed to showcase the culture, products and resources of the French empire, but it was much larger. It occupied the side of the park along the length of the Avenue Daumesnil. The features of the exhibit included the Palace of the Colonies. In front of the palace was a large gilded bronze statue by Leon Drivier entitled France bringing peace and prosperity to the colonies.Dominique Jarrass√©, pg. 118‚Äì120. It had pavilions from each colony and from other nations, cafes and theaters, a Senagalese village complete with inhabitants, and a zoo. The exposition featured eight spectacular fountains, fed with water from Lake Daumesnil. The Grand Signal was a centerpiece of the exposition, a tower forty-five meters high, which spouted water from the top and from jets at nineteen different levels. Two other fountains created a bridge of water forty meters long between the two islands in the lake. A third fountain, called the Theater of Water, was an arc of towers and spouts eighty meters long, which in evening performances produced cascades, jets and curtains of water colored with electric lights. These were early ancestors of today's musical fountains in Dubai and Las Vegas.Virginie Grandval, Fontaines √©ph√©m√®res, in Paris et ses fontaines, pg. 235‚Äì240 Several vestiges of the fair can still be seen. The entrance gate is still standing. After the Fair closed, the Palace of the Colonies became the Museum of the Arts of Africa and the Oceania. In 1934 the zoo was moved to its present location, and embellished with a sixty-five meter high artificial mountain, which became the home of a collection of mountain goats and sheep. The pavilion of Cameroon was preserved and turned into a Buddhist temple and religious center. File:Expo 1931 Av colonie.jpgThe main boulevard of the Paris Colonial Exposition.

It was heavily damaged and not fully restored until the 1990s. At the end of World War II in 1945, the French army began to move out of the Bois de Vincennes. Features of the Bois de Vincennes =Lakes= The Bois de Vincennes is home to four artificial lakes. The water for the lakes was originally pumped from the Marne River, but today comes from a pumping station near the Pont d'Austerlitz on the Seine. * Lac Daumesnil (12 hectares), is located in the western end of the park, and has two islands. Its attractions include the Temple d'Amour and the Swiss Chalet on the Isle de Reuilly, and an artificial grotto. * Lac des Minimes (6 hectares), in the north-east, has three small islands. Its attractions include the vestiges of a Medieval monastery. * Lac de Saint-Mand√©, in the northwest. * Lac de Gravelle (1 hectare), in the southwest, is the smallest lake in the park. At a higher elevation than the other lakes, it provides water to the other lakes through an artificial stream. File:Bois de Vincennes 20060816 09.jpgThe two islands in Lac Daumesnil are connected by a suspension bridge, and are accessible by boat.

It occupies 31 hectares, and is the largest garden built in Paris since the French Empire of Louis Napoleon. It is one of the four parts of the Botanical Garden of Paris, the others being the gardens of the Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle in the Bois de Boulogne; the Jardin des Serres d'Auteuil or greenhouses of Auteuil, and the Arboretum de l'√âcole du Breuil, located in another part of Bois de Vincennes. The Japanese architecture within the garden was inspired by the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. The garden features hundreds of varieties of flowers, including 650 varieties of iris; twenty-pavilions and an exhibit hall; a sculpture garden with works of Alexander Calder, Alberto Giacometti and other international artists; a monumental fountain created by Francois Stahly; and an avenue of pines preserved from the early days of the park.

The Arboretum de l'√âcole du Breuil, in the park's southeast corner, is a municipal arboretum established at this location in 1936. It was created in 1867 by Baron Haussmann as the city's school of horticulture and arboriculture. Today the arboretum contains about 2000 trees, as well as notable collections of shrubs, four hundred varieties of heritage apple and pear trees, and three hundred varieties of lilac.

In 1907 it was the site of the first French Colonial Exposition, with pavilions and villages, complete with inhabitants, from different parts of the Empire. (See history above). The garden gradually fell into disrepair; the tropical plants were largely replaced by French plants, though bamboo, rubber trees and a few other exotic plants can still be found. The pavilions of the French Congo, French Guiana, French Indochina, R√©union, and Tunisia, mostly vandalized and in ruins, can still be seen, as well as vestiges of the old Indochinese garden. The garden was taken over by the City of Paris in 2003, and it is gradually being redesigned and replanted. File:Pavillon tunisie.JPGThe Tunisian Pavilion, a vestige of the 1907 Colonial Exposition.

File:Jardin tropical - Paris - Pavillon de l'Indochine.jpgThe Pavilion of Indochina from the 1907 Colonial Exposition. *The Paris Zoological Park, also known as Zoo of Vincennes, was opened in 1934, inspired by the popular zoo of the 1931 Colonial Exposition. It was modelled upon the Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg, and was revolutionary for its time for putting the animals in open plateaus separated from the public by moats rather than in cages. The most prominent feature is a sixty-five meter high artificial mountain, which is the home of a herd of mouflon, or wild sheep. The zoo has a notable history of successfully breeding wild species, including Indian elephants. The park suffered from the crumbling of its concrete buildings in the 1980s, since they had been built to last only fifty years. It was closed in 2008 for major renovation, and reopened in 2014.

It was converted in 1970 by the Th√©√¢tre du Soleil, led by stage director Ariane Mnouchkine and actor Philippe L√©otard. *The Hippodrome of Vincennes was opened on 29 March 1863, and is devoted largely to harness racing. it was badly damaged during the French-German War of 1870‚Äì71, and was rebuilt in 1983. The tribunes today hold 35,000 spectators. Between 1970 and 1992, it was a concert venue for performers including the Grateful Dead, Bruce Springsteen, Elton John and Michael Jackson. *The V√©lodrome Jacques-Anquetil is a cycling stadium, built in 1896 and used in the 1900 Summer Olympics and 1924 Summer Olympics. It can hold forty thousand spectators. It is popularly called La Cipale, short for Piste Municipale. *The Ferme Georges-Ville, also known as the Farm of Paris, is a small farm located next to the Hippodrome of Vincennes, designed to show schoolchildren a real working farm. It features cows, pigs, sheep and other farm animals, and small fields of corn, wheat and other crops. It is named for the French agronomist George Ville (1824‚Äì1897), who, with the support of the Emperor Louis Napoleon, introduced the use of chemical fertilizer to French farming. *The Fort neuf de Vincennes (New fort of Vincennes, located in the north of the park near the Chateau de Vincennes, is a military installation serving as a training center and the headquarters of the medical services of the French military and other military detachments. It was one of ring of fifteen forts built in a circle around Paris by King Louis Philippe I between 1841 and 1843. It is not open to the public. *The Institut national du sport, de l'expertise et de la performance (National Institute of sport, expertise, and performance), or INSEP, is the national training school for physical education and sports, under the National Institute of Sport and Physical Education. Established in 1975, it includes facilities for training in swimming, gymnastics, tennis, shooting, archery, gymnastics, fencing, cycling and other sports, and has trained many French Olympic athletes.

The Roman Empire lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective control over its Western provinces; modern historians posit factors including the effectiveness and numbers of the army, the health and numbers of the Roman population, the strength of the economy, the competence of the Emperors, the internal struggles for power, the religious changes of the period, and the efficiency of the civil administration. Increasing pressure from invading barbarians outside Roman culture also contributed greatly to the collapse. Climate change has been suggested as a driver of the changes in some of these factors. The reasons for the collapse are major subjects of the historiography of the ancient world and they inform much modern discourse on state failure.e.g. Why Nations Fail. Acemoglu D and Robinson JA. Profile Books (Random House Inc.) 2012. . pp. 166‚Äì175 In 376, unmanageable numbers of Goths and other non-Roman people, fleeing from the Huns, entered the Empire. In 395, after winning two destructive civil wars, Theodosius I died, leaving a collapsing field army and the Empire, still plagued by Goths, divided between the warring ministers of his two incapable sons. Further barbarian groups crossed the Rhine and other frontiers and, like the Goths, were not exterminated, expelled or subjugated. The armed forces of the Western Empire became few and ineffective, and despite brief recoveries under able leaders, central rule was never effectively consolidated. By 476, the position of Western Roman Emperor wielded negligible military, political, or financial power, and had no effective control over the scattered Western domains that could still be described as Roman. Barbarian kingdoms had established their own power in much of the area of the Western Empire. In 476, Odoacer deposed the last emperor in Italy, and the Western Senate sent the imperial insignia to the Eastern Emperor. While its legitimacy lasted for centuries longer and its cultural influence remains today, the Western Empire never had the strength to rise again. It never again controlled any portion of Western Europe to the North of the Alps. The Eastern Roman, or Byzantine Empire survived, and though lessened in strength remained for centuries an effective power of the Eastern Mediterranean. While the loss of political unity and military control is universally acknowledged, the Fall is not the only unifying concept for these events; the period described as Late Antiquity emphasizes the cultural continuities throughout and beyond the political collapse. Historical approaches Since 1776, when Edward Gibbon published the first volume of his The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Decline and Fall has been the theme around which much of the history of the Roman Empire has been structured. \\"From the eighteenth century onward,\\" historian Glen Bowersock wrote, \\"we have been obsessed with the fall: it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline, and, hence, as a symbol for our own fears.\\"Glen Bowersock, \\"The Vanishing Paradigm of the Fall of Rome\\" Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 1996. vol. 49 no. 8 pp 29‚Äì43. The Fall is not the only unifying concept for these events; the period described as Late Antiquity emphasizes the cultural continuities throughout and beyond the political collapse. =Timespan= The Fall of the Western Roman Empire was the process in which it failed to enforce its rule. The loss of centralized political control over the West, and the lessened power of the East, are universally agreed, but the theme of decline has been taken to cover a much wider time span than the hundred years from 376. For Cassius Dio, the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 CE marked the descent \\"from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron\\",Dio Cassius 72.36.4, Loeb edition translated E. Cary while Gibbon also began his narrative of decline from the reign of Commodus, after a number of introductory chapters. Arnold J. Toynbee and James Burke argue that the entire Imperial era was one of steady decay of institutions founded in republican times, while Theodor Mommsen excluded the imperial period from his Nobel Prize-winning History of Rome (1854‚Äì56). As one convenient marker for the end, 476 has been used since Gibbon, but other key dates for the fall of the Roman Empire in the West include the Crisis of the Third Century, the Crossing of the Rhine in 406 (or 405), the sack of Rome in 410, and the death of Julius Nepos in 480. Routes taken by barbarian invaders of the Roman Empire during the Migration Period =Reasons= Gibbon gave a classic formulation of reasons why the Fall happened. He gave great weight to internal decline as well as to attacks from outside the Empire. Gibbon felt that Christianity had hastened the Fall, but also ameliorated the results: Some modern Roman historians do not believe that Christianity per se had a significant role in the Empire's fall, in part because of the Eastern (and thoroughly Christian) empire‚Äôs continuation for almost a thousand years longer. Alexander Demandt enumerated 210 different theories on why Rome fell, and new ideas have emerged since.Alexander Demandt: 210 Theories, quoting A. Demandt, Der Fall Roms (1984) 695. Historians still try to analyze the reasons for loss of political control over a vast territory (and, as a subsidiary theme, the reasons for the survival of the Eastern Roman Empire). Comparison has also been made with China after the end of the Han dynasty, which re-established unity under the Sui dynasty while the Mediterranean world remained politically disunited. Harper identifies a Roman climatic optimum from about 200 BCE to 150 CE, when lands around the Mediterranean were generally warm and well-watered. From 150 to 450, the climate entered a transitional period, in which taxes were less easy to collect and bore more heavily on the working population. After about 450, the climate worsened further in the Late Antique Little Ice Age. Climate change has also been suggested as a driver of changes in populations outside the Empire, in particular on the Eurasian steppe. =Alternative descriptions and labels= From at least the time of Henri Pirenne scholars have described a continuity of Roman culture and political legitimacy long after 476. Pirenne postponed the demise of classical civilization to the 8th century. He challenged the notion that Germanic barbarians had caused the Western Roman Empire to end, and he refused to equate the end of the Western Roman Empire with the end of the office of emperor in Italy. He pointed out the essential continuity of the economy of the Roman Mediterranean even after the barbarian invasions, and suggested that only the Muslim conquests represented a decisive break with antiquity. The more recent formulation of a historical period characterized as \\"Late Antiquity\\" emphasizes the transformations of ancient to medieval worlds within a cultural continuity. In recent decades archaeologically-based argument even extends the continuity in material culture and in patterns of settlement as late as the eleventh century. Observing the political reality of lost control (and the attendant fragmentation of commerce, culture, and language), but also the cultural and archaeological continuities, the process has been described as a complex cultural transformation, rather than a fall. Height of power, crises, and recoveries =Height of power, systematic weaknesses= The Roman Empire reached its greatest geographical extent under Trajan (r. 98‚Äì117), who ruled a prosperous state that stretched from Armenia to the Atlantic. The Empire had large numbers of trained, supplied, and disciplined soldiers, drawn from a growing population. It had a comprehensive civil administration based in thriving cities with effective control over public finances. Among its literate elite it had ideological legitimacy as the only worthwhile form of civilization and a cultural unity based on comprehensive familiarity with Greek and Roman literature and rhetoric. The Empire's power allowed it to maintain extreme differences of wealth and status (including slavery on a large scale), and its wide-ranging trade networks permitted even modest households to use goods made by professionals far away. The empire had both strength and resilience. Its financial system allowed it to raise significant taxes which, despite endemic corruption, supported a large regular army with logistics and training. The cursus honorum, a standardized series of military and civil posts organised for ambitious aristocratic men, ensured that powerful noblemen became familiar with military and civil command and administration. At a lower level within the army, connecting the aristocrats at the top with the private soldiers, a large number of centurions were well- rewarded, literate, and responsible for training, discipline, administration, and leadership in battle. City governments with their own properties and revenues functioned effectively at a local level; membership of city councils involved lucrative opportunities for independent decision-making, and, despite its obligations, became seen as a privilege. Under a series of emperors who each adopted a mature and capable successor, the Empire did not require civil wars to regulate the imperial succession. Requests could be submitted directly to the better emperors, and the answers had the force of law, putting the imperial power directly in touch with even humble subjects. The cults of polytheist religion were hugely varied, but none claimed that theirs was the only truth, and their followers displayed mutual tolerance, producing a polyphonous religious harmony.Edward Gibbon Chapter 2. Fall In The West. The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire http://www.ccel.org/ccel/gibbon/decline/files/volume1/chap2.htm Religious strife was rare after the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 136 (after which the devastated Judaea ceased to be a major centre for Jewish unrest). Nevertheless, it remained a culture based on an early subsistence economy, with no germ theory of disease. Despite its aqueducts, the water supply did not allow good hygiene, and sewage was disposed of on the streets, in open drains, or by scavenging animals. Even in the Roman Climatic Optimum, local harvest failures causing famines were always a possibility. And even in good times, Roman women needed to have, on average, six children each in order to maintain the population. Good nourishment and bodily cleanliness were privileges of the rich, advertised by their firm tread, healthy skin color, and lack of the \\"dull smell of the underbathed\\".Through the Eye of a Needle: wealth, the Fall of Rome, and the making of Christianity in the West, 350-550 AD. pp 220-221. Princeton University Press 2012. . Infant mortality was very high, diarrhoeal diseases were a major cause of death, and malaria was endemic in many areas, notably in the city of Rome itself, possibly encouraged by the enthusiasm of rich Romans for water features in their gardens. =Climatic worsening and plague= From about 150, the climate became on average somewhat worse for most of the inhabited lands around the Mediterranean.McCormick, Michael, Ulf B√ºntgen, Mark A.

Roman Empire in the early second century =Crisis of the Third Century= The Empire suffered multiple serious crises during the third century. The rising Sassanid Empire inflicted three crushing defeats on Roman field armies and remained a potent threat for centuries. Other disasters included repeated civil wars, barbarian invasions, and more mass-mortality in the Plague of Cyprian (from 250 onwards). Rome abandoned the province of Dacia on the north of the Danube (271), and for a short period the Empire split into a Gallic Empire in the West (260‚Äì274), a Palmyrene Empire in the East (260‚Äì273), and a central Roman rump state. The Rhine/Danube frontier also came under more effective threats from larger barbarian groupings, which had developed improved agriculture and increased their populations. The average nutritional state of the population in the West suffered a serious decline in the late second century; the population of North-Western Europe did not recover, though the Mediterranean regions did.G.

Under Gallienus (Emperor from 253 to 268) the senatorial aristocracy ceased joining the ranks of the senior military commanders, its typical members lacking interest in military service and showing incompetence at command. Aurelius Victor De Caesaribus. chapter XXXIII verse 34. \\"Et patres quidem praeter commune Romani malum orbis stimulabat proprii ordinis contumelia, 34 quia primus ipse metu socordiae suae, ne imperium ad optimos nobilium transferretur, senatum militia vetuit et adire exercitum. Huic novem annorum potentia fuit.\\" http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html (in Latin) alt= The divided Empire in 271 CE =Reunification and political division= Aurelian reunited the empire in 274, and from 284 Diocletian and his successors reorganized it with more emphasis on the military. John the Lydian, writing over two centuries later, reported that Diocletian's army at one point totaled 389,704 men, plus 45,562 in the fleets, and numbers may have increased later. With the limited communications of the time, both the European and the Eastern frontiers needed the attention of their own supreme commanders. Diocletian tried to solve this problem by re-establishing an adoptive succession with a senior (Augustus) and junior (Caesar) emperor in each half of the Empire, but this system of tetrarchy broke down within one generation; the hereditary principle re-established itself with generally unfortunate results, and thereafter civil war became again the main method of establishing new imperial regimes. Although Constantine the Great (in office 306 to 337) again re-united the Empire, towards the end of the fourth century the need for division was generally accepted. From then on, the Empire existed in constant tension between the need for two emperors and their mutual mistrust. Until late in the fourth century the united Empire retained sufficient power to launch attacks against its enemies in Germania and in the Sassanid Empire. Receptio of barbarians became widely practised: imperial authorities admitted potentially hostile groups into the Empire, split them up, and allotted to them lands, status, and duties within the imperial system. In this way many groups provided unfree workers (coloni) for Roman landowners, and recruits (laeti) for the Roman army. Sometimes their leaders became officers. Normally the Romans managed the process carefully, with sufficient military force on hand to ensure compliance, and cultural assimilation followed over the next generation or two. alt= Map of the Roman Empire under the Tetrarchy, showing the dioceses and the four Tetrarchs' zones of influence =Growing social divisions= The new supreme rulers disposed of the legal fiction of the early Empire (seeing the emperor as but the first among equals); emperors from Aurelian (reigned 270‚Äì275) onwards openly styled themselves as dominus et deus, \\"lord and god\\", titles appropriate for a master-slave relationship.Macarius Magnes, Apocriticus IV: 23: \\"Therefore you make a great mistake in thinking that God is angry if any other is called a god, and obtains the same title as Himself. For even rulers do not object to the title from their subjects, nor masters from slaves.\\" An elaborate court ceremonial developed, and obsequious flattery became the order of the day. Under Diocletian, the flow of direct requests to the emperor rapidly reduced and soon ceased altogether. No other form of direct access replaced them, and the emperor received only information filtered through his courtiers. Official cruelty, supporting extortion and corruption, may also have become more commonplace. While the scale, complexity, and violence of government were unmatched, the emperors lost control over their whole realm insofar as that control came increasingly to be wielded by anyone who paid for it. Meanwhile, the richest senatorial families, immune from most taxation, engrossed more and more of the available wealth and income, while also becoming divorced from any tradition of military excellence. One scholar identifies a great increase in the purchasing power of gold, two and a half fold from 274 to the later fourth century, which may be an index of growing economic inequality between a gold- rich elite and a cash-poor peasantry. Within the late Roman military, many recruits and even officers had barbarian origins, and soldiers are recorded as using possibly-barbarian rituals such as elevating a claimant on shields. Some scholars have seen this as an indication of weakness; others disagree, seeing neither barbarian recruits nor new rituals as causing any problem with the effectiveness or loyalty of the army. 313‚Äì376: Abuse of power, frontier warfare, and rise of Christianity In 313 Constantine I declared official toleration of Christianity, followed over the ensuing decades by establishment of Christian orthodoxy and by official and private action against pagans and non-orthodox Christians. His successors generally continued this process, and Christianity became the religion of any ambitious civil official. Under Constantine the cities lost their revenue from local taxes, and under Constantius II (r. 337‚Äì361) their endowments of property. This worsened the existing difficulty in keeping the city councils up to strength, and the services provided by the cities were scamped or abandoned. Public building projects became fewer, more often repairs than new construction, and now provided at state expense rather than by local grandees wishing to consolidate long-term local influence. A further financial abuse was Constantius's increased habit of granting to his immediate entourage the estates of persons condemned of treason and other capital charges; this reduced future though not immediate income, and those close to the emperor gained a strong incentive to stimulate his suspicion of plots. Constantine settled Franks on the lower left bank of the Rhine; their settlements required a line of fortifications to keep them in check, indicating that Rome had lost almost all local control. Under Constantius, bandits came to dominate areas such as Isauria well within the empire. The tribes of Germany also became more populous and more threatening. In Gaul, which did not really recover from the invasions of the third century, there was widespread insecurity and economic decline in the 300s, perhaps worst in Armorica. By 350, after decades of pirate attacks, virtually all villas in Armorica were deserted, and local use of money ceased about 360. Repeated attempts to economize on military expenditure included billeting troops in cities, where they could less easily be kept under military discipline and could more easily extort from civilians. Except in the rare case of a determined and incorruptible general, these troops proved ineffective in action and dangerous to civilians. Frontier troops were often given land rather than pay; as they farmed for themselves, their direct costs diminished, but so did their effectiveness, and there was much less economic stimulus to the frontier economy. However, except for the provinces along the lower Rhine, the agricultural economy was generally doing well. The numbers and effectiveness of the regular soldiers may have declined during the fourth century: payrolls were inflated so that pay could be diverted and exemptions from duty sold, their opportunities for personal extortion were multiplied by residence in cities, and their effectiveness was reduced by concentration on extortion instead of drill. However, extortion, gross corruption, and occasional ineffectivenessTacitus, Annals, book 11, chapter 18. http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Annals/11B*.html Corbulo ... recalled the legions, as lethargic in their toils and duties as they were ardent in pillage, to the old code with its prohibitions against falling out on march or beginning an action without orders. were not new to the Roman army; there is no consensus whether its effectiveness significantly declined before 376. Ammianus Marcellinus, himself a professional soldier, repeats longstanding observations about the superiority of contemporary Roman armies being due to training and discipline, not to physical size or strength. Despite a possible decrease in its ability to assemble and supply large armies, Rome maintained an aggressive and potent stance against perceived threats almost to the end of the fourth century.

In civil legislation Julian was notable for his pro-pagan policies. All Christian sects were officially tolerated by Julian, persecution of heretics was forbidden, and non-Christian religions were encouraged. Some Christians continued to destroy temples, disrupt rituals, and break sacred images, seeking martyrdom and at times achieving it at the hands of non-Christian mobs or secular authorities; some pagans attacked the Christians who had previously been involved with the destruction of temples. Julian won victories against Germans who had invaded Gaul. He launched an expensive campaign against the Persians, which ended in defeat and his own death. He succeeded in marching to the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon, but lacked adequate supplies for an assault. He burned his boats and supplies to show resolve in continuing operations, but the Sassanids began a war of attrition by burning crops. Finding himself cut off in enemy territory, he began a land retreat during which he was mortally wounded. His successor Jovian, acclaimed by a demoralized army, began his brief reign (363‚Äì364) trapped in Mesopotamia without supplies. To purchase safe passage home, he had to concede areas of northern Mesopotamia and Kurdistan, including the strategically important fortress of Nisibis, which had been Roman since before the Peace of Nisibis in 299. The brothers Valens (r. 364‚Äì378) and Valentinian I (r. 364‚Äì375) energetically tackled the threats of barbarian attacks on all the Western frontiers and tried to alleviate the burdens of taxation, which had risen continuously over the previous forty years; Valens in the East reduced the tax demand by half in his fourth year. Both were Christians and confiscated the temple lands that Julian had restored, but were generally tolerant of other beliefs. Valentinian in the West refused to intervene in religious controversy; in the East, Valens had to deal with Christians who did not conform to his ideas of orthodoxy, and persecution formed part of his response. The wealth of the church increased dramatically, immense resources both public and private being used for ecclesiastical construction and support of the religious life. Bishops in wealthy cities were thus able to offer vast patronage; Ammianus described some as \\"enriched from the offerings of matrons, ride seated in carriages, wearing clothing chosen with care, and serve banquets so lavish that their entertainments outdo the tables of kings\\". Edward Gibbon remarked that \\"the soldiers' pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity\\", though there are no figures for the monks and nuns nor for their maintenance costs. Pagan rituals and buildings had not been cheap either; the move to Christianity may not have had significant effects on the public finances. Some public disorder also followed competition for prestigious posts; Pope Damasus I was installed in 366 after an election whose casualties included a hundred and thirty-seven corpses in the basilica of Sicininus. Valentinian died of an apoplexy while shouting at envoys of Germanic leaders. His successors in the West were children, his sons Gratian (r. 375‚Äì383) and Valentinian II (r. 375‚Äì392). Gratian, \\"alien from the art of government both by temperament and by training\\" removed the Altar of Victory from the Senate House, and he rejected the pagan title of Pontifex Maximus. 376‚Äì395; invasions, civil wars, and religious discord =Battle of Adrianople= In 376 the East faced an enormous barbarian influx across the Danube, mostly Goths who were refugees from the Huns. They were exploited by corrupt officials rather than effectively resettled, and they took up arms, joined by more Goths and by some Alans and Huns. Valens was in Asia with his main field army, preparing for an assault on the Persians, and redirecting the army and its logistic support would have required time. Gratian's armies were distracted by Germanic invasions across the Rhine. In 378 Valens attacked the invaders with the Eastern field army, perhaps some 20,000 men ‚Äì possibly only 10% of the soldiers nominally available in the Danube provinces ‚Äì and in the Battle of Adrianople, 9 August 378, he lost much of that army and his own life. All of the Balkan provinces were thus exposed to raiding, without effective response from the remaining garrisons who were \\"more easily slaughtered than sheep\\". Cities were able to hold their own walls against barbarians who had no siege equipment, and they generally remained intact although the countryside suffered. =Partial recovery in the Balkans= Gratian appointed a new Augustus, a proven general from Hispania called Theodosius. During the next four years, he partially re-established the Roman position in the East. These campaigns depended on effective imperial coordination and mutual trust ‚Äì between 379 and 380 Theodosius controlled not only the Eastern empire, but also, by agreement, the diocese of Illyricum. Theodosius was unable to recruit enough Roman troops, relying on barbarian warbands without Roman military discipline or loyalty. In contrast, during the Cimbrian War, the Roman Republic, controlling a smaller area than the western Empire, had been able to reconstitute large regular armies of citizens after greater defeats than Adrianople, and it ended that war with the near- extermination of the invading barbarian supergroups, each recorded as having more than 100,000 warriors (with allowances for the usual exaggeration of numbers by ancient authors). The final Gothic settlement was acclaimed with relief, even the official panegyrist admitting that these Goths could not be expelled or exterminated, nor reduced to unfree status. Instead they were either recruited into the imperial forces, or settled in the devastated provinces along the south bank of the Danube, where the regular garrisons were never fully re-established. In some later accounts, and widely in recent work, this is regarded as a treaty settlement, the first time that barbarians were given a home within the Empire in which they retained their political and military cohesion. No formal treaty is recorded, nor details of whatever agreement was actually made; when the Goths are next mentioned in Roman records, they have different leaders and are soldiers of a sort. In 391 Alaric, a Gothic leader, rebelled against Roman control. Goths attacked the emperor himself, but within a year Alaric was accepted as a leader of Theodosius's Gothic troops and this rebellion was over. Theodosius's financial position must have been difficult, since he had to pay for expensive campaigning from a reduced tax base. The business of subduing barbarian warbands also demanded substantial gifts of precious metal. Nevertheless, he is represented as financially lavish, though personally frugal when on campaign. At least one extra levy provoked desperation and rioting in which the emperor's statues were destroyed. He was pious, a Nicene Christian heavily influenced by Ambrose, and implacable against heretics. In 392 he forbade even private honor to the gods, and pagan rituals such as the Olympic Games. He either ordered or connived at the widespread destruction of sacred buildings. =Civil wars= Theodosius had to face a powerful usurper in the West; Magnus Maximus declared himself Emperor in 383, stripped troops from the outlying regions of Britannia (probably replacing some with federate chieftains and their war-bands) and invaded Gaul. His troops killed Gratian and he was accepted as Augustus in the Gallic provinces, where he was responsible for the first official executions of Christian heretics. To compensate the Western court for the loss of Gaul, Hispania, and Britannia, Theodosius ceded the diocese of Dacia and the diocese of Macedonia to their control. In 387 Maximus invaded Italy, forcing Valentinian II to flee to the East, where he accepted Nicene Christianity. Maximus boasted to Ambrose of the numbers of barbarians in his forces, and hordes of Goths, Huns, and Alans followed Theodosius. Maximus negotiated with Theodosius for acceptance as Augustus of the West, but Theodosius refused, gathered his armies, and counterattacked, winning the civil war in 388. There were heavy troop losses on both sides of the conflict. Later Welsh legend has Maximus's defeated troops resettled in Armorica, instead of returning to Britannia, and by 400, Armorica was controlled by Bagaudae rather than by imperial authority. Theodosius restored Valentinian II, still a very young man, as Augustus in the West. He also appointed Arbogast, a pagan general of Frankish origin, as Valentinian's commander-in- chief and guardian. Valentinian quarreled in public with Arbogast, failed to assert any authority, and died, either by suicide or by murder, at the age of 21. Arbogast and Theodosius failed to come to terms and Arbogast nominated an imperial official, Eugenius (r. 392‚Äì394), as emperor in the West. Eugenius made some modest attempts to win pagan support, and with Arbogast led a large army to fight another destructive civil war. They were defeated and killed at the Battle of the Frigidus, which was attended by further heavy losses especially among the Gothic federates of Theodosius. The north-eastern approaches to Italy were never effectively garrisoned again. Eastern and Western Roman Empire at the death of Theodosius I in 395 Theodosius died a few months later in early 395, leaving his young sons Honorius (r. 395‚Äì423) and Arcadius (r. 395‚Äì408) as emperors. In the immediate aftermath of Theodosius's death, the magister militum Stilicho, married to Theodosius's niece, asserted himself in the West as the guardian of Honorius and commander of the remains of the defeated Western army. He also claimed control over Arcadius in Constantinople, but Rufinus, magister officiorum on the spot, had already established his own power there. Henceforward the Empire was not under the control of one man, until much of the West had been permanently lost. Neither Honorius nor Arcadius ever displayed any ability either as rulers or as generals, and both lived as the puppets of their courts. Stilicho tried to reunite the Eastern and Western courts under his personal control, but in doing so achieved only the continued hostility of all of Arcadius's successive supreme ministers. Military, financial, and political ineffectiveness: the process of failure The ineffectiveness of Roman military responses from Stilicho onwards has been described as \\"shocking\\", with little evidence of indigenous field forces or of adequate training, discipline, pay, or supply for the barbarians who formed most of the available troops. Local defence was occasionally effective, but was often associated with withdrawal from central control and taxes; in many areas, barbarians under Roman authority attacked culturally-Roman \\"Bagaudae\\". Corruption, in this context the diversion of public finance from the needs of the army, may have contributed greatly to the Fall. The rich senatorial aristocrats in Rome itself became increasingly influential during the fifth century; they supported armed strength in theory, but did not wish to pay for it or to offer their own workers as army recruits. They did, however, pass large amounts of money to the Christian Church. At a local level, from the early fourth century, the town councils lost their property and their power, which often became concentrated in the hands of a few local despots beyond the reach of the law. The fifth-century Western emperors, with brief exceptions, were individuals incapable of ruling effectively or even of controlling their own courts. Those exceptions were responsible for brief, but remarkable resurgences of Roman power. 395‚Äì406; Stilicho The emperor Honorius, a contemporary depiction on a alt=406 representation of Honorius attended by a winged Victory on a globe and bearing a labarum with the words \\"In nomine XRI vincas semper\\", \\"In the name of Christ thou wilt always conquer Without an authoritative ruler, the Balkan provinces fell rapidly into disorder. Alaric was disappointed in his hopes for promotion to magister militum after the battle of the Frigidus. He again led Gothic tribesmen in arms and established himself as an independent power, burning the countryside as far as the walls of Constantinople. Alaric's ambitions for long-term Roman office were never quite acceptable to the Roman imperial courts, and his men could never settle long enough to farm in any one area. They showed no inclination to leave the Empire and face the Huns from whom they had fled in 376; indeed the Huns were still stirring up further migrations which often ended by attacking Rome in turn. Alaric's group was never destroyed nor expelled from the Empire, nor acculturated under effective Roman domination. =Stilicho's attempts to unify the Empire, revolts, and invasions= Stilicho moved with his remaining mobile forces into Greece, a clear threat to Rufinus' control of the Eastern empire. The bulk of Rufinus' forces were occupied with Hunnic incursions in Asia Minor and Syria, leaving Thrace undefended. He opted to enlist Alaric and his men, and sent them to Thessaly to stave off Stilicho's threat, which they did. No battle took place. Stilicho was forced to send some of his Eastern forces home. They went to Constantinople under the command of one Gainas, a Goth with a large Gothic following. On arrival, Gainas murdered Rufinus, and was appointed magister militum for Thrace by Eutropius, the new supreme minister and the only eunuch consul of Rome, who controlled Arcadius \\"as if he were a sheep\\".Zosimus, book 5 http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_History/Book_the_Fifth Stilicho obtained a few more troops from the German frontier and continued to campaign ineffectively against the Eastern empire; again he was successfully opposed by Alaric and his men. During the next year, 397, Eutropius personally led his troops to victory over some Huns who were marauding in Asia Minor. With his position thus strengthened he declared Stilicho a public enemy, and he established Alaric as magister militum per Illyricum. A poem by Synesius advises the emperor to display manliness and remove a \\"skin-clad savage\\" (probably Alaric) from the councils of power and his barbarians from the Roman army. We do not know if Arcadius ever became aware of the existence of this advice, but it had no recorded effect. Synesius, from a province suffering the widespread ravages of a few poor but greedy barbarians, also complained of \\"the peacetime war, one almost worse than the barbarian war and arising from military indiscipline and the officer's greed.\\" The Favorites of the Emperor Honorius, by alt=1883 depiction of a court scene, Honorius feeding his fowls with obsequious courtiers in attendance The magister militum in the Diocese of Africa declared for the East and stopped the supply of grain to Rome. Italy had not fed itself for centuries and could not do so now. In 398, Stilicho sent his last reserves, a few thousand men, to re-take the Diocese of Africa, and he strengthened his position further when he married his daughter Maria to Honorius. Throughout this period Stilicho, and all other generals, were desperately short of recruits and supplies for them. In 400, Stilicho was charged to press into service any \\"laetus, Alamannus, Sarmatian, vagrant, son of a veteran\\" or any other person liable to serve. He had reached the bottom of his recruitment pool. Though personally not corrupt, he was very active in confiscating assets; the financial and administrative machine was not producing enough support for the army. An ivory alt=The Monza diptych, Stilicho with his family In 399, Tribigild's rebellion in Asia Minor allowed Gainas to accumulate a significant army (mostly Goths), become supreme in the Eastern court, and execute Eutropius. He now felt that he could dispense with Alaric's services and he nominally transferred Alaric's province to the West. This administrative change removed Alaric's Roman rank and his entitlement to legal provisioning for his men, leaving his army ‚Äì the only significant force in the ravaged Balkans ‚Äì as a problem for Stilicho. In 400, the citizens of Constantinople revolted against Gainas and massacred as many of his people, soldiers and their families, as they could catch. Some Goths at least built rafts and tried to cross the strip of sea that separates Asia from Europe; the Roman navy slaughtered them. By the beginning of 401, Gainas' head rode a pike through Constantinople while another Gothic general became consul. Meanwhile, groups of Huns started a series of attacks across the Danube, and the Isaurians marauded far and wide in Anatolia. In 401 Stilicho travelled over the Alps to Raetia, to scrape up further troops. He left the Rhine defended only by the \\"dread\\" of Roman retaliation, rather than by adequate forces able to take the field. Early in spring, Alaric, probably desperate, invaded Italy, and he drove Honorius westward from Mediolanum, besieging him in Hasta Pompeia in Liguria. Stilicho returned as soon as the passes had cleared, meeting Alaric in two battles (near Pollentia and Verona) without decisive results. The Goths, weakened, were allowed to retreat back to Illyricum where the Western court again gave Alaric office, though only as comes and only over Dalmatia and Pannonia Secunda rather than the whole of Illyricum. Stilicho probably supposed that this pact would allow him to put Italian government into order and recruit fresh troops. He may also have planned with Alaric's help to relaunch his attempts to gain control over the Eastern court.

The letters form a Christogramalt=Chi-rho pendant of Empress Maria, daughter of Stilicho and wife of Honorius. However, in 405, Stilicho was distracted by a fresh invasion of Northern Italy. Another group of Goths fleeing the Huns, led by one Radagaisus, devastated the north of Italy for six months before Stilicho could muster enough forces to take the field against them. Stilicho recalled troops from Britannia and the depth of the crisis was shown when he urged all Roman soldiers to allow their personal slaves to fight beside them. His forces, including Hun and Alan auxiliaries, may in the end have totalled rather less than 15,000 men. Radagaisus was defeated and executed. 12,000 prisoners from the defeated horde were drafted into Stilicho's service. Stilicho continued negotiations with Alaric; Flavius Aetius, son of one of Stilicho's major supporters, was sent as a hostage to Alaric in 405. In 406 Stilicho, hearing of new invaders and rebels who had appeared in the northern provinces, insisted on making peace with Alaric, probably on the basis that Alaric would prepare to move either against the Eastern court or against the rebels in Gaul. The Senate deeply resented peace with Alaric; in 407, when Alaric marched into Noricum and demanded a large payment for his expensive efforts in Stilicho's interests, the senate, \\"inspired by the courage, rather than the wisdom, of their predecessors,\\"Gibbon, 277 preferred war. One senator famously declaimed Non est ista pax, sed pactio servitutis (\\"This is not peace, but a pact of servitude\\").Zosimus, Nova Historia, book 5. http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zosimus05_book5.htm Stilicho paid Alaric four thousand pounds of gold nevertheless. Stilicho sent Sarus, a Gothic general, over the Alps to face the usurper Constantine III, but he lost and barely escaped, having to leave his baggage to the bandits who now infested the Alpine passes. The empress Maria, daughter of Stilicho, died in 407 or early 408 and her sister Aemilia Materna Thermantia married Honorius. In the East, Arcadius died on 1 May 408 and was replaced by his son Theodosius II; Stilicho seems to have planned to march to Constantinople, and to install there a regime loyal to himself. He may also have intended to give Alaric a senior official position and send him against the rebels in Gaul. Before he could do so, while he was away at Ticinum at the head of a small detachment, a bloody coup against his supporters took place at Honorius's court. It was led by Stilicho's own creature, one Olympius. 408‚Äì410; the end of effective regular field armies (410-455), starvation in Italy, sack of Rome =Stilicho's fall and Alaric's reaction= Stilicho had news of the coup at Bononia (where he was probably waiting for Alaric). His small escort of barbarians was led by Sarus, who rebelled. His Gothic troops massacred the Hun contingent in their sleep, and then withdrew towards the cities in which their families were billeted. Stilicho ordered that these troops should not be admitted, but, now without an army, he was forced to flee for sanctuary, promised his life, and killed. Alaric was again declared an enemy of the Emperor. The conspiracy then massacred the families of the federate troops (as presumed supporters of Stilicho, although they had probably rebelled against him), and the troops defected en masse to Alaric. The conspirators seem to have let their main army disintegrate, and had no policy except hunting down supporters of Stilicho. Italy was left without effective indigenous defence forces thereafter. Heraclianus, a co-conspirator of Olympius, became governor of the Diocese of Africa, where he controlled the source of most of Italy's grain, and he supplied food only in the interests of Honorius's regime. As a declared 'enemy of the Emperor', Alaric was denied the legitimacy that he needed to collect taxes and hold cities without large garrisons, which he could not afford to detach. He again offered to move his men, this time to Pannonia, in exchange for a modest sum of money and the modest title of Comes, but he was refused as a supporter of Stilicho. He moved into Italy, probably using the route and supplies arranged for him by Stilicho, bypassing the imperial court in Ravenna which was protected by widespread marshland and had a port, and he menaced the city of Rome itself. In 407, there was no equivalent of the determined response to the catastrophic Battle of Cannae in 216 BCE, when the entire Roman population, even slaves, had been mobilized to resist the enemy. Alaric's military operations centred on the port of Rome, through which Rome's grain supply had to pass. Alaric's first siege of Rome in 408 caused dreadful famine within the walls. It was ended by a payment that, though large, was less than one of the richest senators could have produced. The super-rich aristocrats made little contribution; pagan temples were stripped of ornaments to make up the total. With promises of freedom, Alaric also recruited many of the slaves in Rome. Alaric withdrew to Tuscany and recruited more slaves. Ataulf, a Goth nominally in Roman service and brother- in-law to Alaric, marched through Italy to join Alaric despite taking casualties from a small force of Hunnic mercenaries led by Olympius. Sarus was an enemy of Ataulf, and on Ataulf's arrival went back into imperial service. =Alaric besieges Rome= In 409 Olympius fell to further intrigue, having his ears cut off before he was beaten to death. Alaric tried again to negotiate with Honorius, but his demands (now even more moderate, only frontier land and food) were inflated by the messenger and Honorius responded with insults, which were reported verbatim to Alaric. He broke off negotiations and the standoff continued. Honorius's court made overtures to the usurper Constantine III in Gaul and arranged to bring Hunnic forces into Italy, Alaric ravaged Italy outside the fortified cities (which he could not garrison), and the Romans refused open battle (for which they had inadequate forces). Late in the year Alaric sent bishops to express his readiness to leave Italy if Honorius would only grant his people a supply of grain. Honorius, sensing weakness, flatly refused. Alaric moved to Rome and captured Galla Placidia, sister of Honorius. The Senate in Rome, despite its loathing for Alaric, was now desperate enough to give him almost anything he wanted. They had no food to offer, but they tried to give him imperial legitimacy; with the Senate's acquiescence, he elevated Priscus Attalus as his puppet emperor, and he marched on Ravenna. Honorius was planning to flee to Constantinople when a reinforcing army of 4,000 soldiers from the East disembarked in Ravenna. These garrisoned the walls and Honorius held on. He had Constantine's principal court supporter executed and Constantine abandoned plans to march to Honorius's defence. Attalus failed to establish his control over the Diocese of Africa, and no grain arrived in Rome where the famine became even more frightful. Jerome reports cannibalism within the walls.Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume VI/The Letters of St. Jerome/Letter 127 Philip Schaff et al. http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nicene_and_Post- Nicene_Fathers:_Series_II/Volume_VI/The_Letters_of_St._Jerome/Letter_127 Attalus brought Alaric no real advantage, failing also to come to any useful agreement with Honorius (who was offered mutilation, humiliation, and exile). Indeed, Attalus's claim was a marker of threat to Honorius, and Alaric dethroned him after a few months. In 410 Alaric took Rome by starvation, sacked it for three days (there was relatively little destruction, and in some Christian holy places Alaric's men even refrained from wanton wrecking and rape), and invited its remaining barbarian slaves to join him, which many did. The city of Rome was the seat of the richest senatorial noble families and the centre of their cultural patronage; to pagans it was the sacred origin of the empire, and to Christians the seat of the heir of Saint Peter, Pope Innocent I, the most authoritative bishop of the West. Rome had not fallen to an enemy since the Battle of the Allia over eight centuries before. Refugees spread the news and their stories throughout the Empire, and the meaning of the fall was debated with religious fervour. Both Christians and pagans wrote embittered tracts, blaming paganism or Christianity respectively for the loss of Rome's supernatural protection, and blaming Stilicho's earthly failures in either case. Some Christian responses anticipated the imminence of Judgement Day. Augustine in his book \\"City of God\\" ultimately rejected the pagan and Christian idea that religion should have worldly benefits; he developed the doctrine that the City of God in heaven, undamaged by mundane disasters, was the true objective of Christians. More practically, Honorius was briefly persuaded to set aside the laws forbidding pagans to be military officers, so that one Generidus could re-establish Roman control in Dalmatia. Generidus did this with unusual effectiveness; his techniques were remarkable for this period, in that they included training his troops, disciplining them, and giving them appropriate supplies even if he had to use his own money. The penal laws were reinstated no later than 25 August 410 and the overall trend of repression of paganism continued. Inscription honouring Honorius, as florentissimo invictissimoque, the most excellent and invincible, 417‚Äì418, alt=A monument from the Forum Romanum describing Honorius as most excellent and invincible Procopius mentions a story in which Honorius, on hearing the news that Rome had \\"perished\\", was shocked, thinking the news was in reference to his favorite chicken he had named \\"Roma\\". On hearing that Rome itself had fallen he breathed a sigh of relief: =The Goths move out of Italy= Alaric then moved south, intending to sail to Africa, but his ships were wrecked in a storm and he shortly died of fever. His successor Ataulf, still regarded as an usurper and given only occasional and short-term grants of supplies, moved north into the turmoil of Gaul, where there was some prospect of food. His supergroup of barbarians are called the Visigoths in modern works: they may now have been developing their own sense of identity. 405‚Äì418 in the Gallic provinces; barbarians and usurpers, loss of Britannia, partial loss of Hispania and Gaul The Crossing of the Rhine in 405/6 brought unmanageable numbers of Germanic and Alan barbarians (perhaps some 30,000 warriors, 100,000 people) into Gaul. They may have been trying to get away from the Huns, who about this time advanced to occupy the Great Hungarian Plain. For the next few years these barbarian tribes wandered in search of food and employment, while Roman forces fought each other in the name of Honorius and a number of competing claimants to the imperial throne. The remaining troops in Britannia elevated a succession of imperial usurpers. The last, Constantine III, raised an army from the remaining troops in Britannia, invaded Gaul and defeated forces loyal to Honorius led by Sarus. Constantine's power reached its peak in 409 when he controlled Gaul and beyond, he was joint consul with Honorius and his magister militum Gerontius defeated the last Roman force to try to hold the borders of Hispania. It was led by relatives of Honorius; Constantine executed them. Gerontius went to Hispania where he may have settled the Sueves and the Asding Vandals. Gerontius then fell out with his master and elevated one Maximus as his own puppet emperor. He defeated Constantine and was besieging him in Arelate when Honorius's general Constantius arrived from Italy with an army (possibly, mainly of Hun mercenaries). Gerontius's troops deserted him and he committed suicide. Constantius continued the siege, defeating a relieving army. Constantine surrendered in 411 with a promise that his life would be spared, and was executed. In 410, the Roman civitates of Britannia rebelled against Constantine and evicted his officials. They asked for help from Honorius, who replied that they should look to their own defence. While the British may have regarded themselves as Roman for several generations, and British armies may at times have fought in Gaul, no central Roman government is known to have appointed officials in Britannia thereafter. The supply of coinage to the Diocese of Britannia ceases with Honorius.Dorchester Town House Coins. R. Reece, In: 'A late Roman town house and its environs; The Excavations of C.D. Drew and K.C. Collingwood Selby in Colliton Park, Dorchester, Dorset 1937-8'. By Emma Durham and M Fulford, Britannia Monograph Series 26, pages 103-111, 2014. In 411, Jovinus rebelled and took over Constantine's remaining troops on the Rhine. He relied on the support of Burgundians and Alans to whom he offered supplies and land. In 413 Jovinus also recruited Sarus; Ataulf destroyed their regime in the name of Honorius and both Jovinus and Sarus were executed. The Burgundians were settled on the left bank of the Rhine. Ataulf then operated in the south of Gaul, sometimes with short-term supplies from the Romans. All usurpers had been defeated, but large barbarian groups remained un-subdued in both Gaul and Hispania. The imperial government was quick to restore the Rhine frontier. The invading tribes of 407 moved into Spain at the end of 409; the Visigoths left Italy at the beginning of 412 and settled themselves around Narbo. Heraclianus was still in command in the diocese of Africa; of the clique that overthrew Stilicho, he was the last to retain power. In 413 he led an invasion of Italy, lost to a subordinate of Constantius, and fled back to Africa where he was murdered by Constantius's agents. In January 414 Roman naval forces blockaded Ataulf in Narbo, where he married Galla Placidia. The choir at the wedding included Attalus, a puppet emperor without revenues or soldiers.Eucharisticus Paulinus Pellaeus English translation by H. G. Evelyn White, 1921, Loeb Classical Library's Ausonius, vol. II, pp 295‚Äë351. http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Paulinus_Pellaeus/Eucharisticus*.html Ataulf famously declared that he had abandoned his intention to set up a Gothic empire because of the irredeemable barbarity of his followers, and instead he sought to restore the Roman Empire. He handed Attalus over to Honorius's regime for mutilation, humiliation, and exile, and abandoned Attalus's supporters. (One of them, Paulinus Pellaeus, recorded that the Goths considered themselves merciful for allowing him and his household to leave destitute, but alive, without being raped.) Ataulf moved out of Gaul, to Barcelona. There his infant son by Galla Placidia was buried, and there Ataulf was assassinated by one of his household retainers, possibly a former follower of Sarus. His ultimate successor Wallia had no agreement with the Romans; his people had to plunder in Hispania for food. =Settlement of 418; barbarians within the empire= alt=Areas allotted to or claimed by barbarian groups in 416‚Äì418 In 416 Wallia reached agreement with Constantius; he sent Galla Placidia back to Honorius and received provisions, six hundred thousand modii of wheat. From 416 to 418, Wallia's Goths campaigned in Hispania on Constantius's behalf, exterminating the Siling Vandals in Baetica and reducing the Alans to the point where the survivors sought the protection of the king of the Asding Vandals. (After retrenchment they formed another barbarian supergroup, but for the moment they were reduced in numbers and effectively cowed.) In 418, by agreement with Constantius, Wallia's Goths accepted land to farm in Aquitania. Constantius also reinstituted an annual council of the southern Gallic provinces, to meet at Arelate. Although Constantius rebuilt the western field army to some extent, he did so only by replacing half of its units (vanished in the wars since 395) by re-graded barbarians, and by garrison troops removed from the frontier. The Notitia Dignitatum gives a list of the units of the western field army circa 425. It does not give strengths for these units, but A. H. M. Jones used the Notitia to estimate the total strength of the field armies in the West at 113,000 : Gaul, ‚Äúabout‚Äù 35,000; Italy, ‚Äúnearly‚Äù 30,000; Britain 3,000; in Spain, 10‚Äì11,000, in the diocese of Illyricum 13‚Äì14,000, and in the diocese of Africa 23,000. Constantius had married the princess Galla Placidia (despite her protests) in 417. The couple soon had two children, Honoria and Valentinian III, and Constantius was elevated to the position of Augustus in 420. This earned him the hostility of the Eastern court, which had not agreed to his elevation. Nevertheless, Constantius had achieved an unassailable position at the Western court, in the imperial family, and as the able commander-in-chief of a partially restored army. This settlement represented a real success for the Empire‚Äîa poem by Rutilius Namatianus celebrates his voyage back to Gaul in 417 and his confidence in a restoration of prosperity. But it marked huge losses of territory and of revenue; Rutilius travelled by ship past the ruined bridges and countryside of Tuscany, and in the west the River Loire had become the effective northern boundary of Roman Gaul. In the east of Gaul the Franks controlled large areas; the effective line of Roman control until 455 ran from north of Cologne (lost to the Ripuarian Franks in 459) to Boulogne. The Italian areas which had been compelled to support the Goths had most of their taxes remitted for several years. Even in southern Gaul and Hispania large barbarian groups remained, with thousands of warriors, in their own non-Roman military and social systems. Some occasionally acknowledged a degree of Roman political control, but without the local application of Roman leadership and military power they and their individual subgroups pursued their own interests. 421‚Äì433; renewed dissension after the death of Constantius, partial loss of the Diocese of Africa Constantius died in 421, after only seven months as Augustus. He had been careful to make sure that there was no successor in waiting, and his own children were far too young to take his place. Honorius was unable to control his own court, and the death of Constantius initiated more than ten years of instability. Initially Galla Placidia sought Honorius's favour in the hope that her son might ultimately inherit. Other court interests managed to defeat her, and she fled with her children to the Eastern court in 422. Honorius himself died, shortly before his thirty-ninth birthday, in 423. After some months of intrigue, the patrician Castinus installed Joannes as Western Emperor, but the Eastern Roman government proclaimed the child Valentinian III instead, his mother Galla Placidia acting as regent during his minority. Joannes had few troops of his own. He sent Aetius to raise help from the Huns. An Eastern army landed in Italy, captured Joannes, cut his hand off, abused him in public, and killed him with most of his senior officials. Aetius returned, three days after Joannes' death, at the head of a substantial Hunnic army which made him the most powerful general in Italy. After some fighting, Placidia and Aetius came to an agreement; the Huns were paid off and sent home, while Aetius received the position of magister militum. Galla Placidia, as Augusta, mother of the Emperor, and his guardian until 437, could maintain a dominant position in court, but women in Ancient Rome did not exercise military power, and she could not herself become a general. She tried for some years to avoid reliance on a single dominant military figure, maintaining a balance of power between her three senior officers, Aetius (magister militum in Gaul), Count Boniface governor in the Diocese of Africa, and Flavius Felix magister militum praesentalis in Italy. Meanwhile, the Empire deteriorated seriously. Apart from the losses in the Diocese of Africa, Hispania was slipping out of central control and into the hands of local rulers and Suevic bandits. In Gaul the Rhine frontier had collapsed, the Visigoths in Aquitaine may have launched further attacks on Narbo and Arelate, and the Franks, increasingly powerful although disunited, were the major power in the north-east. Aremorica was controlled by Bagaudae, local leaders not under the authority of the Empire. Aetius at least campaigned vigorously and mostly victoriously, defeating aggressive Visigoths, Franks, fresh Germanic invaders, Bagaudae in Aremorica, and a rebellion in Noricum. Not for the first time in Rome's history, a triumvirate of mutually distrustful rulers proved unstable. In 427 Felix tried to recall Boniface from Africa; he refused, and overcame Felix's invading force. Boniface probably recruited some Vandal troops among others. In 428 the Vandals and Alans were united under the able, ferocious, and long-lived king Genseric; he moved his entire people to Tarifa near Gibraltar, divided them into 80 groups nominally of 1,000 people (perhaps 20,000 warriors in total), and crossed from Hispania to Mauretania without opposition. (The Straits of Gibraltar were not an important thoroughfare at the time, and there were no significant fortifications nor military presence at this end of the Mediterranean.) They spent a year moving slowly to Numidia, defeating Boniface. He returned to Italy where Aetius had recently had Felix executed. Boniface was promoted to magister militum and earned the enmity of Aetius, who may have been absent in Gaul at the time. In 432 the two met at the Battle of Ravenna, which left Aetius's forces defeated and Boniface mortally wounded. Aetius temporarily retired to his estates, but after an attempt to murder him he raised another Hunnic army (probably by conceding parts of Pannonia to them) and in 433 he returned to Italy, overcoming all rivals. He never threatened to become an Augustus himself and thus maintained the support of the Eastern court, where Valentinian's cousin Theodosius II reigned until 450. 433‚Äì454; ascendancy of Aetius, loss of Carthage Aetius campaigned vigorously, somewhat stabilizing the situation in Gaul and in Hispania. He relied heavily on his forces of Huns. With a ferocity celebrated centuries later in the Nibelungenlied, the Huns slaughtered many Burgundians on the middle Rhine, re-establishing the survivors as Roman allies, the first Kingdom of the Burgundians. This may have returned some sort of Roman authority to Trier. Eastern troops reinforced Carthage, temporarily halting the Vandals, who in 435 agreed to limit themselves to Numidia and leave the most fertile parts of North Africa in peace. Aetius concentrated his limited military resources to defeat the Visigoths again, and his diplomacy restored a degree of order to Hispania. However, his general Litorius was badly defeated by the Visigoths at Toulouse, and a new Suevic king, Rechiar, began vigorous assaults on what remained of Roman Hispania. At one point Rechiar even allied with Bagaudae. These were Romans not under imperial control; some of their reasons for rebellion may be indicated by the remarks of a Roman captive under Attila who was happy in his lot, giving a lively account of \\"the vices of a declining empire, of which he had so long been the victim; the cruel absurdity of the Roman princes, unable to protect their subjects against the public enemy, unwilling to trust them with arms for their own defence; the intolerable weight of taxes, rendered still more oppressive by the intricate or arbitrary modes of collection; the obscurity of numerous and contradictory laws; the tedious and expensive forms of judicial proceedings; the partial administration of justice; and the universal corruption, which increased the influence of the rich, and aggravated the misfortunes of the poor.\\" Vegetius's advice on re-forming an effective army may be dated to the early 430s,Seeck O.

On The Ruin of Britain (De Excidio Britanniae). Translation by J. A. Giles https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1949/pg1949.html Nevertheless, effective imperial protection from barbarian ravages was eagerly sought. About this time authorities in Britannia asked Aetius for help: \\"To Aetius, now consul for the third time: the groans of the Britons.\\" And again a little further, thus: ‚Äì \\"The barbarians drive us to the sea; the sea throws us back on the barbarians: thus two modes of death await us, we are either slain or drowned.\\" The Romans, however, could not assist them ... The Visigoths passed another waymark on their journey to full independence; they made their own foreign policy, sending princesses to make (rather unsuccessful) marriage alliances with Rechiar of the Sueves and with Huneric, son of the Vandal king Genseric. In 439 the Vandals moved eastward (temporarily abandoning Numidia) and captured Carthage, where they established an independent state with a powerful navy. This brought immediate financial crisis to the Western Empire; the diocese of Africa was prosperous, normally required few troops to keep it secure, contributed large tax revenues, and exported wheat to feed Rome and many other areas. Roman troops assembled in Sicily, but the planned counter-attack never happened. Huns attacked the Eastern empire, and \\"the troops, which had been sent against Genseric, were hastily recalled from Sicily; the garrisons, on the side of Persia, were exhausted; and a military force was collected in Europe, formidable by their arms and numbers, if the generals had understood the science of command, and the soldiers the duty of obedience. The armies of the Eastern empire were vanquished in three successive engagements ... From the Hellespont to Thermopylae, and the suburbs of Constantinople, [Attila] ravaged, without resistance, and without mercy, the provinces of Thrace and Macedonia\\" Attila's invasions of the East were stopped by the walls of Constantinople, and at this heavily fortified Eastern end of the Mediterranean there were no significant barbarian invasions across the sea into the rich southerly areas of Anatolia, the Levant, and Egypt. Despite internal and external threats, and more religious discord than the West, these provinces remained prosperous contributors to tax revenue; despite the ravages of Attila's armies and the extortions of his peace treaties, tax revenue generally continued to be adequate for the essential state functions of the Eastern empire. Genseric settled his Vandals as landowners and in 442 was able to negotiate very favourable peace terms with the Western court. He kept his latest gains and his eldest son Huneric was honoured by betrothal to Princess Eudocia, who carried the legitimacy of the Theodosian dynasty. Huneric's Gothic wife was suspected of trying to poison her father-in-law Genseric; he sent her home without her nose or ears, and his Gothic alliance came to an early end. The Romans regained Numidia, and Rome again received a grain supply from Africa. The losses of income from the Diocese of Africa were equivalent to the costs of nearly 40,000 infantry or over 20,000 cavalry. The imperial regime had to increase taxes. Despite admitting that the peasantry could pay no more, and that a sufficient army could not be raised, the imperial regime protected the interests of landowners displaced from Africa and allowed wealthy individuals to avoid taxes. =444‚Äì453; attacks by the empire of Attila the Hun= In 444, the Huns were united under Attila. His subjects included Huns, outnumbered several times over by other groups, predominantly Germanic. His power rested partly on his continued ability to reward his favoured followers with precious metals, and he continued to attack the Eastern Empire until 450, by when he had extracted vast sums of money and many other concessions. Attila may not have needed any excuse to turn West, but he received one in the form of a plea for help from Honoria, the Emperor's sister, who was being forced into a marriage which she resented. Attila claimed Honoria as his wife and half of the Western Empire's territory as his dowry. Faced with refusal, he invaded Gaul in 451 with a huge army. In the bloody battle of the Catalaunian Plains the invasion was stopped by the combined forces of the barbarians within the Western empire, coordinated by Aetius and supported by what troops he could muster. The next year, Attila invaded Italy and proceeded to march upon Rome, but an outbreak of disease in his army, lack of supplies, reports that Eastern Roman troops were attacking his noncombatant population in Pannonia, and, possibly, Pope Leo's plea for peace induced him to halt this campaign. Attila unexpectedly died a year later (453) and his empire crumbled as his followers fought for power. The life of Severinus of Noricum gives glimpses of the general insecurity, and ultimate retreat of the Romans on the Upper Danube, in the aftermath of Attila's death. The Romans were without adequate forces; the barbarians inflicted haphazard extortion, murder, kidnap, and plunder on the Romans and on each other. \\"So long as the Roman dominion lasted, soldiers were maintained in many towns at the public expense to guard the boundary wall. When this custom ceased, the squadrons of soldiers and the boundary wall were blotted out together. The troop at Batavis, however, held out. Some soldiers of this troop had gone to Italy to fetch the final pay to their comrades, and no one knew that the barbarians had slain them on the way.\\"The Life of St. Severinus (1914) by Eugippius pp. 13‚Äì113, English translation by George W.

In 454 Aetius was personally stabbed to death by Valentinian, who was himself murdered by the dead general's supporters a year later. \\"[Valentinian] thought he had slain his master; he found that he had slain his protector: and he fell a helpless victim to the first conspiracy which was hatched against his throne.\\"Bury, J. B., The Cambridge Medieval History Vol. I (1924), pages 418‚Äì419 A rich senatorial aristocrat, Petronius Maximus, who had encouraged both murders, then seized the throne. He broke the engagement between Huneric, prince of the Vandals, and Princess Eudocia, and had time to send Avitus to ask for the help of the Visigoths in Gaul before a Vandal fleet arrived in Italy. Petronius was unable to muster any effective defence and was killed by a mob as he tried to flee the city. The Vandals entered Rome, and plundered it for two weeks. Despite the shortage of money for the defence of the state, considerable private wealth had accumulated since the previous sack in 410. The Vandals sailed away with large amounts of treasure and also with the Princess Eudocia, who became the wife of one Vandal king and the mother of another. The Vandals conquered Sicily, and their fleet became a constant danger to Roman sea trade and to the coasts and islands of the western Mediterranean. 455‚Äì456; failure of Avitus, further losses in Gaul, rise of Ricimer Avitus, at the Visigothic court in Burdigala, declared himself Emperor. He moved on Rome with Visigothic support which gained his acceptance by Majorian and Ricimer, commanders of the remaining army of Italy. This was the first time that a barbarian kingdom had played a key role in the imperial succession. Avitus's son-in-law Sidonius wrote propaganda to present the Visigothic king Theoderic II as a reasonable man with whom a Roman regime could do business. Theoderic's payoff included precious metal from stripping the remaining public ornaments of Italy, and an unsupervised campaign in Hispania. There he not only defeated the Sueves, executing his brother-in-law Rechiar, but he also plundered Roman cities. The Burgundians expanded their kingdom in the Rhone valley and the Vandals took the remains of the Diocese of Africa. In 456 the Visigothic army was too heavily engaged in Hispania to be an effective threat to Italy, and Ricimer had just destroyed a pirate fleet of sixty Vandal ships; Majorian and Ricimer marched against Avitus and defeated him near Placentia. He was forced to become Bishop of Placentia, and died (possibly murdered) a few weeks later. 457‚Äì467; resurgence under Majorian, attempt to recover Africa, control by Ricimer During his four-year reign Majorian reconquered most of Hispania and southern Gaul, meanwhile reducing the Visigoths, Burgundians and Suevi to federate status. Majorian and Ricimer were now in control of Italy. Ricimer was the son of a Suevic king, and his mother was the daughter of a Gothic one, so he could not aspire to an imperial throne. After some months, allowing for negotiation with the new emperor of Constantinople and the defeat of 900 Alamannic invaders of Italy by one of his subordinates, Majorian was acclaimed as Augustus. Majorian is described by Gibbon as \\"a great and heroic character\\". He rebuilt the army and navy of Italy with vigour and set about recovering the remaining Gallic provinces, which had not recognized his elevation. He defeated the Visigoths at the Battle of Arelate, reducing them to federate status and obliging them to give up their claims in Hispania; he moved on to subdue the Burgundians, the Gallo-Romans around Lugdunum (who were granted tax concessions and whose senior officials were appointed from their own ranks) and the Suevi and Bagaudae in Hispania. Marcellinus, magister militum in Dalmatia and the pagan general of a well-equipped army, acknowledged him as emperor and recovered Sicily from the Vandals. Aegidius also acknowledged Majorian and took effective charge of northern Gaul. (Aegidius may also have used the title \\"King of the Franks\\".) Abuses in tax collection were reformed and the city councils were strengthened, both actions necessary to rebuild the strength of the Empire but disadvantageous to the richest aristocrats. Majorian prepared a fleet at Carthago Nova for the essential reconquest of the Diocese of Africa. The fleet was burned by traitors, and Majorian made peace with the Vandals and returned to Italy. Here Ricimer met him, arrested him, and executed him five days later. Marcellinus in Dalmatia and Aegidius around Soissons in northern Gaul rejected both Ricimer and his puppets and maintained some version of Roman rule in their areas. Ricimer later ceded Narbo and its hinterland to the Visigoths for their help against Aegidius; this made it impossible for Roman armies to march from Italy to Hispania. Ricimer was then the effective ruler of Italy (but little else) for several years. From 461 to 465 the pious Italian aristocrat Libius Severus reigned. There is no record of anything significant that he even tried to achieve, he was never acknowledged by the East whose help Ricimer needed, and he died conveniently in 465. 467‚Äì472, Anthemius; an Emperor and an army from the East Tremissis of Anthemius After two years without a Western Emperor, the Eastern court nominated Anthemius, a successful general who had a strong claim on the Eastern throne. He arrived in Italy with an army, supported by Marcellinus and his fleet; he married his daughter to Ricimer, and he was proclaimed Augustus in 467. In 468, at vast expense, the Eastern empire assembled an enormous force to help the West retake the Diocese of Africa. Marcellinus rapidly drove the Vandals from Sardinia and Sicily, and a land invasion evicted them from Tripolitania. The commander in chief with the main force defeated a Vandal fleet near Sicily and landed at Cape Bon. Here Genseric offered to surrender, if he could have a five-day truce to prepare the process. He used the respite to prepare a full-scale attack preceded by fireships, which destroyed most of the Roman fleet and killed many of its soldiers. The Vandals were confirmed in their possession of the Diocese of Africa and they retook Sardinia and Sicily. Marcellinus was murdered, possibly on orders from Ricimer. The Praetorian prefect of Gaul, Arvandus, tried to persuade the new king of the Visigoths to rebel, on the grounds that Roman power in Gaul was finished anyway, but he refused. Anthemius was still in command of an army in Italy. Additionally, in northern Gaul, a British army led by one Riothamus, operated in imperial interests. Anthemius sent his son over the Alps, with an army, to request that the Visigoths return southern Gaul to Roman control. This would have allowed the Empire land access to Hispania again. The Visigoths refused, defeated the forces of both Riothamus and Anthemius, and with the Burgundians took over almost all of the remaining imperial territory in southern Gaul. Ricimer then quarreled with Anthemius, and besieged him in Rome, which surrendered in July 472 after more months of starvation. Anthemius was captured and executed (on Ricimer's orders) by the Burgundian prince Gundobad. In August Ricimer died of a pulmonary haemorrhage. Olybrius, his new emperor, named Gundobad as his patrician, then died himself shortly thereafter. 472‚Äì476; the final emperors, puppets of the warlords After the death of Olybrius there was a further interregnum until March 473, when Gundobad proclaimed Glycerius emperor. He may have made some attempt to intervene in Gaul; if so, it was unsuccessful. Tremissis of Julius Nepos In 474 Julius Nepos, nephew and successor of the general Marcellinus, arrived in Rome with soldiers and authority from the eastern emperor Leo I. Gundobad had already left to contest the Burgundian throne in Gaul and Glycerius gave up without a fight, retiring to become bishop of Salona in Dalmatia. In 475, Orestes, a former secretary of Attila, drove Julius Nepos out of Ravenna and proclaimed his own son Flavius Momyllus Romulus Augustus (Romulus Augustulus) to be Emperor, on October 31. His surname 'Augustus' was given the diminutive form 'Augustulus' by rivals because he was still a minor, and he was never recognized outside of Italy as a legitimate ruler. In 476, Orestes refused to grant Odoacer and the Heruli federated status, prompting an invasion. Orestes fled to the city of Pavia on August 23, 476, where the city's bishop gave him sanctuary. Orestes was soon forced to flee Pavia when Odoacer's army broke through the city walls and ravaged the city. Odoacer's army chased Orestes to Piacenza, where they captured and executed him on August 28, 476. On September 4, 476, Odoacer forced then 16-year-old Romulus Augustulus, whom his father Orestes had proclaimed to be Rome's Emperor, to abdicate. After deposing Romulus, Odoacer did not execute him. The Anonymus Valesianus wrote that Odoacer, \\"taking pity on his youth\\", spared Romulus' life and granted him an annual pension of 6,000 solidi before sending him to live with relatives in Campania.Gibbon, p. 406 Odoacer then installed himself as ruler over Italy, and sent the Imperial insignia to Constantinople. From 476; last Emperor, rump states Europe and the Mediterranean in 476 AD By convention, the Western Roman Empire is deemed to have ended on 4 September 476, when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus and proclaimed himself ruler of Italy, but this convention is subject to many qualifications. In Roman constitutional theory, the Empire was still simply united under one emperor, implying no abandonment of territorial claims. In areas where the convulsions of the dying Empire had made organized self-defence legitimate, rump states continued under some form of Roman rule after 476. Julius Nepos still claimed to be Emperor of the West and controlled Dalmatia until his murder in 480. Syagrius son of Aegidius ruled the Domain of Soissons until his murder in 487. The indigenous inhabitants of Mauretania developed kingdoms of their own, independent of the Vandals, with strong Roman traits. They again sought Imperial recognition with the reconquests of Justinian I, and they put up effective resistance to the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. While the civitates of Britannia sank into a level of material development inferior even to their pre-Roman Iron Age ancestors, they maintained identifiably Roman traits for some time, and they continued to look to their own defence as Honorius had authorized.The Britons: from Romans to barbarians.

Edited by Hans-Werner Goetz, J√∂rg Janut, and Walter Pohl with the collaboration of S√∂ren Kaschke. Brill, Leiden, 2003. The alt=The Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy Odoacer began to negotiate with the East Roman (Byzantine) Emperor Zeno, who was busy dealing with unrest in the East. Zeno eventually granted Odoacer the status of patrician and accepted him as his own viceroy of Italy. Zeno, however, insisted that Odoacer had to pay homage to Julius Nepos as the Emperor of the Western Empire. Odoacer never returned any territory or real power, but he did issue coins in the name of Julius Nepos throughout Italy. The murder of Julius Nepos in 480 (Glycerius may have been among the conspirators) prompted Odoacer to invade Dalmatia, annexing it to his Kingdom of Italy. In 488 the Eastern emperor authorized a troublesome Goth, Theoderic (later known as \\"the Great\\") to take Italy. After several indecisive campaigns, in 493 Theoderic and Odoacer agreed to rule jointly. They celebrated their agreement with a banquet of reconciliation, at which Theoderic's men murdered Odoacer's, and Theoderic personally cut Odoacer in half. The mostly powerless, but still influential Western Roman Senate continued to exist in the city of Rome under the rule of the Ostrogothic kingdom and, later, the Byzantine Empire for at least another century, before disappearing at an unknown date in the early 7th century. Legacy The Roman Empire was not only a political unity enforced by the use of military power. It was also the combined and elaborated civilization of the Mediterranean basin and beyond. It included manufacture, trade, and architecture, widespread secular literacy, written law, and an international language of science and literature. The Western barbarians lost much of these higher cultural practices, but their redevelopment in the Middle Ages by polities aware of the Roman achievement formed the basis for the later development of Europe. Observing the cultural and archaeological continuities through and beyond the period of lost political control, the process has been described as a complex cultural transformation, rather than a fall.

Military service  Lying about his age, he enlisted on 6 September 1915, aged 16, and on 20 January 1916 embarked for France aboard HMAT Runic with the 9th Reinforcements of the 17th Battalion, Australian 2nd Division. He was transferred to the 20th Battalion with which he fought in the Battle of the Somme. He was wounded in the left ankle during the Battle of Pozi√®res in 1916. He was absent without leave on two occasions. He was wounded twice more, eventually being hurt so badly in 1918 that he was unable to bend his left leg for the rest of his life. He returned to Australia on 16 March 1919. After the war he was refused an invalid pension, because the physician insisted that if he could stand up, he did not need one. Disillusioned with the army over this experience, he tore up all of his army photographs, moved into the Australian bush and became a carpenter. He claimed for the next 80 years that he had been wounded in the Second World War, refusing to acknowledge his service during the First World War. He married Doris and they had one son named Marcus, but never told them about his past.  Honours  His secret was discovered in 1998, when he was made a Chevalier (Knight) of the L√©gion d'Honneur by the French government. After this he was able to come to terms with his past and began attending Anzac Day ceremonies. The centenarian Caux spent his final days in a nursing home in Chatswood, a suburb of Sydney. He remained opposed until he died to Australian involvement in foreign wars, in particular the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He died peacefully in his sleep. In 2007, it was revealed that Marcel had led a complex and deceptive life.

Smaller than the standard 14,000-man infantry division, at about 9,000 personnel, its primary means of transport was hundreds of horses and mules controlled by several quartermaster pack companies of muleteers, and for artillery several battalions of 75mm pack howitzers, instead of the standard M2A1 105 mm howitzer, which could be broken down into several loads and carried by mule train. The 5th and 14th Infantry Regiments, Regular Army units which had been stationed in the Panama Canal Zone for several years prior to the war and had received extensive training in jungle operations during that time, were assigned to the division to provide the nucleus of jungle expertise. The 66th Infantry Regiment was constituted in the Regular Army on 10 July 1943, and activated and assigned to the division on 15 July 1943 as its third regiment. After training at Camp Carson, Colorado, the division was sent to Hunter Ligget Military Reservation in the mountains inland from Big Sur, California, where it maneuvered against the 89th Light Division as a test of the light division concept. As a result of the test, it was decided that the light divisions had insufficient manpower and firepower to be effective, and the concept was abandoned. The 71st Division was sent to Fort Benning, Georgia, where it was reorganized and retrained as a standard infantry division, although it remained unusual in having Regular Army infantry regiments assigned to a division raised in the Army of the United States. =Combat chronicle= Jewish women and children who were liberated from a concentration camp by the 71st Infantry Division during the final days of World War II in Europe The 71st Infantry Division arrived at Le Havre, France, 6 February 1945, and trained at Camp Old Gold with headquarters at Limesy. The division moved east, relieved the 100th Infantry Division at Ratswiller and saw its first action on 11 March 1945. Their ouster of the Germans from France began 15 March. The division moved through outer belts of the Siegfried Line, captured Pirmasens, 21 March, and crossed the Rhine at Oppenheim, 30 March. The 71st continued the advance, taking Coburg without resistance, cutting the Munich-Berlin autobahn, 13 April, and capturing Bayreuth after fierce opposition on 16 April. Moving south, the Division destroyed Sch√∂nfeld, 18 April, took Rosenberg, crossed the Naab River at Kallm√ºnz on 24 April and crossed the Danube on 26 April. Regensburg fell on the next day and Straubing on 28 April. As resistance crumbled, the division crossed the Isar on 29 April and entered Austria, 2 May. Participated in the liberation of concentration camps including one in Austria called Gunskirchen Lager, a subcamp of Mathausen, on 4 May. A pamphlet was produced by the US Army after they liberated the camp, called \\"The Seventy-First came to Gunskirchen Lager.\\" The book recounts in detail, and with graphic photos, the tragedy they found in the camp. The complete booklet is available for free on-line. The 71st organized and occupied defensive positions along the Enns River and contacted Russian forces east of Linz, 8 May, the day before hostilities ceased, having gone further east than any other U.S. Army unit. The division was assigned occupational duties until it left for home and inactivation 1 March 1946. During the last several weeks of the war, the 761st Tank Battalion, an African-American unit, was attached to the 71st Division and fought with it. The 71st Division is also the formation in which Lt. John D. Eisenhower, General Dwight Eisenhower's son, served. In January 1946, Colonel William Westmoreland was appointed commander, and was responsible for leading the units that had not yet been deactivated back to the United States so they could be demobilized. =Casualties= *Total battle casualties: 1,114Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 243Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Wounded in action: 843Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Missing in action: 9Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Prisoner of war: 19Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) =Assignments in ETO= *21 January 1945: Fifteenth Army, 12th Army Group. *2 March 1945: Seventh Army, 6th Army Group. *9 March 1945: XV Corps. *22 March 1945: XXI Corps. *25 March 1945: VI Corps. *29 March 1945: 12th Army Group. *8 April 1945: Third Army, 12th Army Group. *11 April 1945: XII Corps. *20 April 1945: XX Corps. =Alaska= In 1954 the 71st Infantry Division was reactivated in the northwest United States and Alaska as the division headquarters for several geographically separated units, to include the 53d Infantry Regiment headquartered at Fort Richardson, Alaska, with additional units stationed at Fort Greely, and the 4th and 5th Infantry regiments at Fort Lewis, Washington.

She was born in the same bedroom of the Emma Street mansion which had been the birthplace of Princess Ka ªiulani. Her father was James Campbell, one of the wealthiest industrialists in the Kingdom of Hawaii. Her mother was part-Hawaiian Abigail Kuaihelani Maipinepine Bright. She graduated from the College of Notre Dame in Belmont, California, in 1900, when she converted from Anglicanism, religion of her parents, to Roman Catholicism. On January 6, 1902, by virtue of her marriage to Prince David La ªamea Kahalepouli KawƒÅnanakoa Pi ªikoi, she became known as Princess. Photograph by Theodore C. Marceau Prince David became one of the heirs to the throne of the Kingdom of Hawai ªi upon the death of Princess Victoria Ka ªiulani. Prince David died of pneumonia in 1908.

With the Prince of Wales, ca. 1920 Upon the death of her brother-in-law, Prince Jonah K≈´hi≈ç Kalaniana ªole in 1922, Princess Abigail effectively became the leader of all native Hawaiians and took an active part in Hawai ªi's politics as their advocate. She also assumed the role of heir to the throne as native Hawaiians continued to pray for the return of their sovereignty. Unlike her brother-in- law Prince K≈´hi≈ç, Princess Abigail was a devoted Republican and worked to develop its platforms and pursue its ideals. In 1924 she became the Republican national committeewoman for Hawaii and served in that capacity for twelve years. Her prominence on the national stage made Princess Abigail a role model for women in Hawaii. She died at her Honolulu home on April 12, 1945. Fiction She has a short role in Harry Turtledove's novel in Days of Infamy where she is offered the throne of a restored Kingdom of Hawaii. She refuses, not wishing to be a puppet monarch of the Japanese.

The land was ceded to the city of Paris by the Emperor Napoleon III to be turned into a public park in 1852.Dominique Jarrass√©, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, p. 94. It is the second-largest park in Paris, slightly smaller than the Bois de Vincennes on the eastern side of the city. It covers an area of 845 hectares (2088 acres),Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, p. 94. which is about two and a half times the area of Central Park in New York and slightly less (88%) than that of Richmond Park in London. Within the boundaries of the Bois de Boulogne are an English landscape garden with several lakes and a cascade; two smaller botanical and landscape gardens, the Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle and the Pr√©-Catelan; a zoo and amusement park in the Jardin d'Acclimatation; GoodPlanet Foundation's Domaine de Longchamp dedicated to ecology and humanism, The Jardin des Serres d'Auteuil, a complex of greenhouses holding a hundred thousand plants; two tracks for horse racing, the Hippodrome de Longchamp and the Auteuil Hippodrome; a tennis stadium where the French Open tennis tournament is held each year, the Fondation Louis Vuitton and other attractions. History =A hunting preserve, royal ch√¢teaux, and an historic balloon flight= The Bois de Boulogne is in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, on the western edge of the city. The Bois de Boulogne is a remnant of the ancient oak forest of Rouvray, which included the present-day forests of Montmorency, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Chaville, and Meudon.Its name is commemorated in the communes of Rouvray-Catillon and Rouvray-St-Denis. Dagobert I, hunted bears, deer, and other game in the forest. His grandson, Childeric II, gave the forest to the monks of the Abbey of Saint-Denis, who founded several monastic communities there. Philip Augustus (1180‚Äì1223) bought back the main part of the forest from the monks to create a royal hunting reserve. In 1256, Isabelle de France, sister of Saint- Louis, founded the Abbey of Longchamp at the site of the present hippodrome. The Bois received its present name from a chapel, Notre Dame de Boulogne la Petite, which was built in the forest at the command of Philip IV of France (1268‚Äì1314). In 1308, Philip made a pilgrimage to Boulogne-sur-Mer, on the French coast, to see a statue of the Virgin Mary which was reputed to inspire miracles. He decided to build a church with a copy of the statue in a village in the forest not far from Paris, in order to attract pilgrims. The chapel was built after Philip's death between 1319 and 1330, in what is now Boulogne- Billancourt.The current Church of Notre Dame des Menus in Boulogne-Billancourt is built on the foundation of Philip's chapel. During the Hundred Years' War, the forest became a sanctuary for robbers and sometimes a battleground. In 1416‚Äì17, the soldiers of John the Fearless, the Duke of Burgundy, burned part of the forest in their successful campaign to capture Paris. Under Louis XI, the trees were replanted, and two roads were opened through the forest. In 1526, King Francis I of France began a royal residence, the Ch√¢teau de Madrid, in the forest in what is now Neuilly and used it for hunting and festivities. It took its name from a similar palace in Madrid, where Francis had been held prisoner for several months. The Chateau was rarely used by later monarchs, fell into ruins in the 18th century, and was demolished after the French Revolution. Despite its royal status, the forest remained dangerous for travelers; the scientist and traveler Pierre Belon was murdered by thieves in the Bois de Boulogne in 1564.Serge Sauneron, ed. Belon, Le Voyage en √âgypte de Pierre Belon du Mans 1547, (Cairo 1970) Introduction. During the reigns of Henry II and Henry III, the forest was enclosed within a wall with eight gates. Henry IV planted 15,000 mulberry trees, with the hope of beginning a local silk industry. When Henry annulled his marriage to Marguerite de Valois, she went to live in the Ch√¢teau de la Muette, on the edge of the forest. In the early 18th century, wealthy and important women often retired to the convent of the Abbey of Longchamp, located where the hippodrome now stands. A famous opera singer of the period, Madmoiselle Le Maure, retired there in 1727 but continued to give recitals inside the Abbey, even during Holy Week. These concerts drew large crowds and irritated the Archbishop of Paris, who closed the Abbey to the public. Louis XVI and his family used the forest as a hunting ground and pleasure garden. In 1777, the Comte d'Artois, Louis XVI's brother, built a charming miniature palace, the Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle, in the Bois in just 64 days, on a wager from his sister-in-law, Marie Antoinette. Louis XVI also opened the walled park to the public for the first time. On 21 November 1783, Pil√¢tre de Rozier and the Marquis d'Arlandes took off from the Chateau de la Muette in a hot air balloon made by the Montgolfier brothers. Previous flights had carried animals or had been tethered to the ground; this was the first manned free flight in history. The balloon rose to a height of 910 meters (3000 feet), was in the air for 25 minutes, and covered nine kilometers. Following the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814, 40,000 soldiers of the British and Russian armies camped in the forest. Thousands of trees were cut down to build shelters and for firewood. From 1815 until the French Second Republic, the Bois was largely empty, an assortment of bleak ruined meadows and tree stumps where the British and Russians had camped and dismal stagnant ponds.Patrice de Moncan, Les jardins du Baron Haussmann, pp. 57-58.

The Bois de Boulogne was the idea of Napoleon III, shortly after he staged a coup d'√©tat and elevated himself from the President of the French Republic to Emperor of the French in 1852. When Napoleon III became Emperor, Paris had only four public parks - the Tuileries Gardens, the Luxembourg Garden, the Palais-Royal, and the Jardin des Plantes - all in the center of the city. There were no public parks in the rapidly growing east and west of the city. During his exile in London, he had been particularly impressed by Hyde Park, by its lakes and streams and its popularity with Londoners of all social classes. Therefore, he decided to build two large public parks on the eastern and western edges of the city where both the rich and ordinary people could enjoy themselves.Patrice de Moncan, Les Jardins du Baron Haussmann, p. 9. These parks became an important part of the plan for the reconstruction of Paris drawn up by Napoleon III and his new Prefect of the Seine, Baron Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann. The Haussmann plan called for improving the city's traffic circulation by building new boulevards; improving the city's health by building a new water distribution system and sewers; and creating green spaces and recreation for Paris' rapidly growing population. In 1852, Napoleon donated the land for the Bois de Boulogne and for the Bois de Vincennes, which both belonged officially to him. Additional land in the plain of Longchamp, the site of the Ch√¢teau de Madrid, the Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle, and its gardens were purchased and attached to the proposed park, so it could extend all the way to the Seine. Construction was funded out of the state budget, supplemented by selling building lots along the north end of the Bois, in Neuilly.J. M. Chapman and Brian Chapman, The Life and Times of Baron Haussmann: Paris in the Second Empire (Weidenfeld & Nicolson) 1957:89. Napoleon III was personally involved in planning the new parks. He insisted that the Bois de Boulogne should have a stream and lakes, like Hyde Park in London. \\"We must have a stream here, as in Hyde Park,\\" he observed while driving through the Bois, \\"to give life to this arid promenade\\".Charles Merruau, Souvenirs de l'H√¥tel de Ville de Paris, 1848-1852 (Paris 1875:37), quoted in David H. Pinkiney, \\"Napoleon III's Transformation of Paris: The Origins and Development of the Idea\\" The Journal of Modern History 27.2 (June 1955:125-134), p. 126. The first plan for the Bois de Boulogne was drawn up by the architect Jacques Hittorff, who, under King Louis Philippe, had designed the Place de la Concorde, and the landscape architect Louis-Sulpice Var√©, who had designed French landscape gardens at several famous ch√¢teaux. Their plan called for long straight alleys in patterns crisscrossing the park, and, as the Emperor had asked, lakes and a long stream similar to the Serpentine in Hyde Park. Var√© bungled the assignment. He failed to take into account the difference in elevation between the beginning of the stream and the end; if his plan had been followed, the upper part of the stream would have been empty, and the lower portion flooded. When Haussmann saw the partially finished stream, he saw the problem immediately and had the elevations measured. He dismissed the unfortunate Var√© and Hittorff, and designed the solution himself; an upper lake and a lower lake, divided by an elevated road, which serves as a dam, and a cascade which allows the water to flow between the lakes. This is the design still seen today.George-Eug√®ne Haussmann, Les M√©moires, Paris (1891), cited in Patrice de Moncan, p. 24. In 1853, Haussmann hired an experienced engineer from the corps of Bridges and Highways, Jean- Charles Adolphe Alphand, whom he had worked with in his previous assignment in Bordeaux, and made him the head of a new Service of Promenades and Plantations, in charge of all the parks in Paris. Alphand was charged to make a new plan for the Bois de Boulogne. Alphand's plan was radically different from the Hittorff-Var√© plan. While it still had two long straight boulevards, the All√©e Reine Marguerite and the Avenue Longchamp, all the other paths and alleys curved and meandered. The flat Bois de Boulogne was to be turned into an undulating landscape of lakes, hills, islands, groves, lawns, and grassy slopes, not a reproduction of but an idealization of nature. It became the prototype for the other city parks of Paris and then for city parks around the world.Jarrass√©, p. 97. =Construction= The building of the park was an enormous engineering project which lasted for five years. The upper and lower lakes were dug, and the earth piled into islands and hills. Rocks were brought from Fontainbleau and combined with cement to make the cascade and an artificial grotto. The pumps from the Seine could not provide enough water to fill the lakes and irrigate the park, so a new channel was created to bring the water of the Ourcq River, from Monceau to the upper lake in the Bois, but this was not enough. An artesian well 586 meters deep was eventually dug in the plain of Passy which could produce 20,000 cubic meters of water a day. This well went into service in 1861.Patrice de Moncan, p. 60. The water then had to be distributed around the park to water the lawns and gardens; the traditional system of horse-drawn wagons with large barrels of water would not be enough. A system of 66 kilometers of pipes was laid, with a faucet every 30 or 40 meters, a total of 1600 faucets. Alphand also had to build a network of roads, paths, and trails to connect the sights of the park. The two long straight alleys from the old park were retained, and his workers built an additional 58 kilometers of roads paved with stones for carriages, 12 kilometers of sandy paths for horses, and 25 kilometers of dirt trails for walkers. As a result of Louis Napol√©on's exile in London and his memories of Hyde Park, all the new roads and paths were curved and meandering. The planting of the park was the task of the new chief gardener and landscape architect of the Service of Promenades and Plantations, Jean-Pierre Barillet- Deschamps, who had also worked with Haussmann and Alphand in Bordeaux. His gardeners planted 420,000 trees, including hornbeam, beech, linden, cedar, chestnut, and elm, and hardy exotic species, like redwoods. They planted 270 hectares of lawns, with 150 kilograms of seed per hectare, and thousands of flowers. To make the forest more natural, they brought 50 deer to live in and around the Pr√©-Catelan. The park was designed to be more than a collection of picturesque landscapes; it was meant as a place for amusement and recreation, with sports fields, bandstands, cafes, shooting galleries, riding stables, boating on the lakes, and other attractions. In 1855, Gabriel Davioud, a graduate of Ecole des Beaux-Arts, was named the chief architect of the new Service of Promenades and Plantations. He was commissioned to design 24 pavilions and chalets, plus cafes, gatehouses, boating docks, and kiosks. He designed the gatehouses where the guardians of the park lived to look like rustic cottages. He had a real Swiss chalet built out of wood in Switzerland and transported to Paris, where it was reassembled on an island in the lake and became a restaurant. He built another restaurant next to the park's most picturesque feature, the Grand Cascade. He designed artificial grottoes made of rocks and cement, and bridges and balustrades made of cement painted to look like wood. He also designed all the architectural details of the park, from cone-shaped shelters designed to protect horseback riders from the rain to the park benches and direction signs.Patrice de Moncan, pp. 29-32. At the south end of the park, in the Plain of Longchamp, Davioud restored the ruined windmill which was the surviving vestige of the Abbey of Longchamp, and, working with the Jockey Club of Paris, constructed the grandstands of the Hippodrome of Longchamp, which opened in 1857. At the northern end of the park, between the Sablons gate and Neuilly, a 20-hectare section of the park was given to the Societ√© Imperiale zoologique d'Acclimatation, to create a small zoo and botanical garden, with an aviary of rare birds and exotic plants and animals from around the world. In March 1855, an area in the center of the park, called the Pr√©-Catelan, was leased to a concessionaire for a garden and amusement park. It was built on the site of a quarry where the gravel and sand for the park's roads and paths had been dug out. It included a large circular lawn surrounded by trees, grottos, rocks, paths, and flower beds. Davioud designed a buffet, a marionette theater, a photography pavilion, stables, a dairy, and other structures. The most original feature was the Th√©√¢tre des fleurs, an open-air theater in a setting of trees and flowers. Later, an ice skating rink and shooting gallery were added. The Pr√©-Catelan was popular for concerts and dances, but it had continual financial difficulties and eventually went bankrupt. The floral theater remained in business until the beginning of the First World War, in 1914.Jarrass√©, p. 107 and Patrice de Moncan, pp. 64-65.

They also rebuilt the Luxembourg gardens and the gardens of the Champs- Elysees, created smaller squares and parks throughout the center of Paris, and planted thousands of trees along the new boulevards that Haussmann had created. In the 17 years of Napoleon III's reign, they planted no less than 600,000 trees and created a total 1,835 hectares of green space in Paris, more than any other ruler of France before or since.Patrice de Moncan, p. 9. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì71), which led to the downfall of Napoleon III and the long siege of Paris, the park suffered some damage from German artillery bombardment, the restaurant of the Grand Cascade was turned into a field hospital, and many of the park's animals and wild fowl were eaten by the hungry population. In the years following, however, the park quickly recovered. The Bois de Boulogne became a popular meeting place and promenade route for Parisians of all classes. The alleys were filled with carriages, coaches, and horseback riders, and later with men and women on bicycles, and then with automobiles. Families having picnics filled the woods and lawns, and Parisians rowed boats on the lake, while the upper classes were entertained in the cafes. The restaurant of the Pavillon de la Grand Cascade became a popular spot for Parisian weddings. During the winter, when the lakes were frozen, they were crowded with ice skaters.Patrice de Moncan, pp. 65‚Äì70. The activities of Parisians in the Bois, particularly the long promenades in carriages around the lakes, were often portrayed in French literature and art in the second half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. Scenes set in the park appeared in Nana by √âmile Zola and in L'√âducation sentimentale by Gustave Flaubert. In the last pages of Du c√¥t√© de chez Swann in √Ä la recherche du temps perdu (1914), Marcel Proust minutely described a walk around the lakes taken as a child.Jarrass√©, pp. 100‚Äì101. The life in the park was also the subject of the paintings of many artists, including Eduard Manet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Vincent van Gogh, and Mary Cassatt. In 1860, Napoleon opened the Jardin d'Acclimatation, a separate concession of 20 hectares at the north end of the park; it included a zoo and a botanical garden, as well as an amusement park. Between 1877 and 1912, it also served as the home of what was called an ethnological garden, a place where groups of the inhabitants of faraway countries were put on display for weeks at a time in reconstructed villages from their homelands. They were mostly Sub-Saharan Africans, North Africans, or South American Indians, and came mostly from the French colonies in Africa and South America, but also included natives of Lapland and Cossacks from Russia. These exhibitions were extremely popular and took place not only in Paris, but also in Germany, England, and at the Chicago Exposition in the United States; but they were also criticized at the time and later as being a kind of \\"human zoo\\". Twenty-two of these exhibits were held in the park in the last quarter of the 19th century. About ten more were held in the 20th century, with the last one taking place in 1931. In 1905, a grand new restaurant in the classical style was built in the Pr√©-Catelan by architect Guillaume Tronchet. Like the cafe at the Grand Cascade, it became a popular promenade destination for the French upper classes.Jarrass√©, p. 107.

During the 1924 Summer Olympics, the equestrian events took place in the Auteuil Hippodrome. The Bois de Boulonge hosted all rowing teams participating in the Inter-Allied Games, held in Paris in 1919 following the end of World War One. The Bois de Boulogne was officially annexed by the city of Paris in 1929 and incorporated into the 16th arrondissement. Soon after World War II, the park began to come back to life. In 1945, it held its first motor race after the war: the Paris Cup. In 1953, a British group, Les Amis de la France, created the Shakespeare Garden on the site of the old floral theater in the Pr√©-Catelan. From 1952 until 1986, the Duke of Windsor, the title granted to King Edward VIII after his abdication, and his wife, Wallis Simpson, the Duchess of Windsor, lived in the Villa Windsor, a house in the Bois de Boulogne behind the garden of the Bagatelle. The house was (and still is) owned by the City of Paris and was leased to the couple. The Duke died in this house in 1972, and the Duchess died there in 1986. The lease was purchased by Mohamed al-Fayed, the owner of the Ritz Hotel in Paris. The house was visited briefly by Diana, Princess of Wales and her companion, Dodi Fayed, on 31 August 1997, the day that they died in a traffic accident in the Alma tunnel.

Public park On weekends, the Bois de Boulogne is full of activities such as biking, jogging, boat rowing, horseback and pony rides, and remote control speed boats. Picnics are permitted in most parts of the park, but barbecues are not allowed. The Bois de Boulogne hosts several races, like the of Boulogne and the Boulogne half marathon. Since its creation, the last part of the Paris marathon ends by crossing the Bois de Boulogne from . Boulogne Wood is an important place of running in Paris. The Bois holds a three-day weekend party in the month of July, with over 50 bands and singers, attended mostly by students who camp out overnight. Though soliciting for prostitution is illegal in France, at nighttime parts of the Bois de Boulogne are a popular rendezvous place for prostitutes, usually working in vans parked by the side of the road. The French government has been trying to eliminate this business from the park. Features =Lakes and streams= The Grand Cascade The Bois de Boulogne contains two artificial lakes and eight artificial ponds, connected by three artificial streams. They receive their water from a canal drawn from Ourq River and from artesian wells in Passy. The water arrives in the Lac Superieur (Upper Lake), built in 1852 and located near the Hippodrome de Auteil, then flows by gravity to the Grand Cascade and then to the Lac Inferieur, or Lower Lake. *The Lac Inferieur (1853) is the largest lake in the park, near the large lawns of Muette. The area is very popular with joggers, and boats can be rented on the lower lake from 15 February to the end of October. The lake is the home to many swans and ducks. An island in the lake, accessible by boat, contains the city's only monument to the Park's builder, Napoleon III; a small wooden kiosk at the end of the island, called the Kiosk of the Emperor. *The Grand Cascade (1856) was built out of four thousand cubic meters of rocks from Fontainebleau, and two thousand cubic meters of cement. In addition to the picturesque waterfall, it has two artificial grottoes, one over the other, which can be visited. *The Etang de Reservoir holds the water before it falls in the Grand Cascade. *The Ruisseau de Longchamp (1855) is the major artificial stream in the park. It flows through the Pr√©-Catelan, under the alley of Reine Marguerite, then to the Mare des Biches, one of the oldest natural ponds in the park, then to the Etang de Reservoir and the Grand Cascade. *The Mare de Saint-James is located next to the Jardin d'Acclimatation, and was formerly a quarry for sand and gravel. It has two islands which are a sanctuary for birds and small animals. =Gardens= Within the Bois de Boulogne, there are several separate botanical and floral gardens, and gardens of amusement. *The Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle. Following the French Revolution, the miniature chateau and English landscape garden of the Bagatelle was restored to the Bourbon family. They sold it in 1835 to an English nobleman, Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford. It remained separate and outside the Bois de Boulogne until 1905, when it was purchased by the City of Paris and attached to the park. The garden was enlarged and redesigned by Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier, the new Superintendent of Parks of Paris, a pupil of Alphand. He preserved many elements of the old garden, and added sections of botanical garden, including an iris garden and a pond for Nymphaeaceae, or water lilies, popularized at the time by the paintings of Claude Monet. He also built one of the most popular features of the Bagatelle today, the rose garden. The rose garden today has more than nine thousand plants, and is the site of the Concours international de roses nouvelles de Bagatelle, held each June, one of the major competitions of new roses in the world. Since 1983, the Festival of Chopin in Paris is held in the Orangerie, next to the rose garden. The garden also hosts regular exhibits of sculpture and art. The giant sequoia tree in the Pr√©-Catelan, planted in 1872. *The Jardin d'Acclimatation, opened in 1860 as a zoo and pleasure garden, still has many of the traditional features of a children's amusement park, including an archery range, a miniature train ride, pony ride and Guignol puppet theater, but it underwent several changes in its theme in the last decade. A science museum for children, the Exploradome, opened in 1999. It also now includes a section with an Asian theme, with a teahouse, a lacquered bridge, and a Korean garden. In October 2014, a major new museum opened, the Louis Vuitton Foundation, in a building designed by architect Frank Gehry. *The Jardin des Serres d'Auteuil is a large complex of greenhouses in the southern part of the park. They stand on the site of a botanical garden founded in 1761 by King Louis XV. The present greenhouses were built in 1895‚Äì98, and now house about one hundred thousand plants. In 1998 the greenhouses officially became part of the Botanical Garden in Paris, which also includes the Bagatelle in the Bois de Boulogne and the Parc Floral de Paris and the Arboretum de l'Ecole de Breuil in the Bois de Vincennes. *The Pr√©-Catelan still has a few vestiges of its early days; a majestic copper beech planted in 1782; a giant sequoia tree planted in 1872; the old buffet built by Gabriel Davioud; the grand restaurant built by Guillaume Tronchet in 1905; and the Shakespeare Garden, created in 1953 on the site of the old floral theater. Five different natural settings contain all of the trees, bushes and flowers mentioned in Shakespeare's plays.Jarrass√©, pp. 108-109. =Sports= *The Hippodrome de Longchamp, opened in 1857, is built on the site of the old Abbey of Longchamp. A restored windmill, the only building left of the Abbey, is located on the grounds of the track. The major annual racing event at the Hippodrome de Longchamp is the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, held every October. *The Auteuil Hippodrome, covering 33 hectares, opened in 1873. It is used exclusively for steeplechase racing. *The Stade Roland Garros is a tennis complex which hosts the annual French Open tournament in early June. It was opened in 1928 for the first defense of the Davis Cup tennis tournament, and is named for the French aviator Roland Garros, who was the first pilot to fly solo across the Mediterranean and a First World War ace. The 8.5 hectare complex has twenty courts. The famous red clay courts are actually made of white limestone, dusted with a few millimeters of powdered red brick dust. *A weekly 5 km Parkrun takes place within the park. =Recreation= There is a seven-hectare campground in the Bois de Boulogne, Camping Indigo Paris, with five hundred and ten sites (\\"pitches\\") for travelers with tents, caravans and camping cars. Reservations can be made in advance, on-line. Mobile home rentals are also available by reservation.

Cheung; Kai-Pui Lam; and Wayne Luk. \\"Adaptive Routing in Network-on-Chips Using a Dynamic-Programming Network\\". 2011\\\\. p. 1. is a process where a router can forward data via a different route or given destination based on the current conditions of the communication circuits within a system.Haiyong Xie; Lili Qiu; Yang Richard Yang; and Yin Zhang. \\"On Self Adaptive Routing in Dynamic Environments ‚Äî An Evaluation and Design Using a Simple, Probabilistic Scheme\\" . 2004. The term is most commonly associated with data networking to describe the capability of a network to 'route around' damage, such as loss of a node or a connection between nodes, so long as other path choices are available. Dynamic routing allows as many routes as possible to remain valid in response to the change. Systems that do not implement dynamic routing are described as using static routing, where routes through a network are described by fixed paths. A change, such as the loss of a node, or loss of a connection between nodes, is not compensated for. This means that anything that wishes to take an affected path will either have to wait for the failure to be repaired before restarting its journey, or will have to fail to reach its destination and give up the journey. All Protocols There are several protocols that can be used for dynamic routing. Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a distance-vector routing protocols that prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs). Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) determines the best route for data through a packet-switched network. Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) and its advanced form Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) are used by routers to exchange routing data within an autonomous system.  Alternate paths  Many systems use some next-hop forwarding protocol‚Äîwhen a packet arrives at some node, that node decides on-the-fly which link to use to push the packet one hop closer to its final destination. Routers that use some adaptive protocols, such as the Spanning Tree Protocol, in order to \\"avoid bridge loops and routing loops\\", calculate a tree that indicates the one \\"best\\" link for a packet to get to its destination. Alternate \\"redundant\\" links not on the tree are temporarily disabled‚Äîuntil one of the links on the main tree fails, and the routers calculate a new tree using those links to route around the broken link. Routers that use other adaptive protocols, such as grouped adaptive routing, find a group of all the links that could be used to get the packet one hop closer to its final destination. The router sends the packet out any link of that group which is idle. The link aggregation of that group of links effectively becomes a single high-bandwidth connection. Stefan Haas. \\"The IEEE 1355 Standard: Developments, Performance and Application in High Energy Physics\\". 1998\\\\. p. 91. In practice Contact centres employ dynamic routing to increase the operational efficiency of call agents, which boosts both agent and customer satisfaction. This adaptive strategy is commonly referred to as omnichannel, where an integrative customer experience is coupled with increased responsiveness by agents. Dynamic routing is also associated with neuroscience in respect to studies on the relationship between sensory and mnemonic signals and decision making. People using a transport system can display dynamic routing. For example, if a local railway station is closed, people can alight from a train at a different station and use another method, such as a bus, to reach their destination. Another example of dynamic routing can be seen within financial markets.

Murphy (July 27, 1918 ‚Äì March 19, 1945) was a recipient of the Medal of Honor during World War II while serving as a medic in the US 65th Infantry Division. Background Murphy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and lived in Quincy and attended the Thayer Academy in Braintree from where he graduated in 1939. He entered the University of Pennsylvania later that year. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 caused him to attempt to enlist with the U.S. Army. He was denied after failing two physical examinations and classified IV-F. After surgery to correct back problems, he successfully enlisted in November 1943 at Weymouth where he then lived. He became a medic in the U.S. Army 259th Infantry of the 65th Infantry Division. His basic training was at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, and his medical and surgical technician training was at the Fitzsimons General Hospital in Denver, Colorado.

He refused to withdraw for treatment and continued forward, administering first aid under heavy machinegun, mortar, and artillery fire. When the company ran into a thickly sown antipersonnel minefield and began to suffer more and more casualties, he continued to disregard his own wound and unhesitatingly braved the danger of exploding mines, moving about through heavy fire and helping the injured until he stepped on a mine which severed one of his feet. In spite of his grievous wounds, he struggled on with his work, refusing to be evacuated and crawling from man to man administering to them while in great pain and bleeding profusely. He was killed by the blast of another mine which he had dragged himself across in an effort to reach still another casualty. With indomitable courage, and unquenchable spirit of self-sacrifice and supreme devotion to duty which made it possible for him to continue performing his tasks while barely able to move, Pfc. Murphy saved many of his fellow soldiers at the cost of his own life.

Synopsis The show revolved around students and faculty at the fictional Bancroft College, located in the community of Bancroft, somewhere in the American Midwest. The name of the show reflected the overarching theme of the bright promise that the leaders of tomorrow graduating from Bancroft would ostensibly bring. At first, the main character was College president Thomas Boswell (Dana Andrews). Later, the focus shifted from the College, to the town of Bancroft at large, and focused mainly on the Pierce and Jones families. The main character by this time was Sandra Jones, who had been a student at Bancroft College, and married herself into the wealthy Pierce family. Bright Promise was created by the husband-and- wife writing team of Frank and Doris Hursley, who had previously created General Hospital, and was their last project prior to their retirement. Bing Crosby Productions (under the name Frandor Productions) was the packager, with assistance from Cox Broadcasting. The title and closing sequences were filmed at UCLA. Having replaced the game show You Don't Say!, Bright Promise would give way to another serial, Return to Peyton Place, on the NBC daytime schedule; the serial had been soundly defeated in the Nielsen ratings by CBS' The Edge of Night and ABC's One Life to Live. Actress Gail Kobe, a regular on Bright Promise, would become Return's executive producer. Cast Original cast members included the show's star, Dana Andrews, with Susan Brown, Paul Lukather, Ruth McDevitt, Ivor Francis, Forrest Compton, Richard Eastham, Betsy Jones-Moreland, Coleen Gray, Gary Pillar, Peter Hobbs, Peter Ratray, Pat Woodell, Susannah Darrow, Cheryl Miller, and Eric James. Later additions included David Lewis, Annette O'Toole, Dabney Coleman, Marion Brash, Anne Seymour, Anthony Geary, Gail Kobe, John Considine, Philip Carey, Anne Jeffreys and Sherry Alberoni.

Originally she graduated in physics and chemistry, but her interest soon led her to languages. Native in Hungarian, she was able to interpret fluently in nine or ten languages (in four of them even without preparation), and she translated technical literature and read belles-lettres in six languages. She was able to understand journalism in further eleven languages. As she put it, altogether she earned money with sixteen languages (Bulgarian, Chinese, Danish, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Ukrainian). She learned these languages mostly by self- effort, as an autodidact. Her aims to acquire these languages were most of all practical, to satisfy her interest. According to her own account, her long life was highlighted not primarily by the command of languages but the actual study of them. Through her books, published in Hungarian in several editions as well as in some other languages, interviews (in print and on the air) and conversations, she tried to share this joy with generations. As an interpreter, she visited five continents, saw forty countries, and reported about her experiences and adventures in a separate book (Egy tolm√°cs a vil√°g k√∂r√ºl, \\"An interpreter around the world\\").  Her command of specific languages  * In the interview given to Hetek newspaper (1998),November 14, 1998, Full interview in Hungarian she lists the following as the 16 languages she earned money with: :English, Bulgarian, Danish, French, Hebrew, Japanese, Chinese, Latin, Polish, German, Italian, Russian, Romanian, Spanish, Slovak, and Ukrainian. * In the foreword to the first edition of her book How I Learn Languages (1970), she says:Quoted in the English translation, 2nd ed., 2008, pages viii and xvii. :‚ÄúI only have one mother tongue: Hungarian. Russian, English, French, and German live inside me simultaneously with Hungarian. I can switch between any of these languages with great ease, from one word to the next. :Translating texts in Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish generally requires me to spend about half a day brushing up on my language skills and perusing the material to be translated. :The other six languages I know only through translating literature and technical material.‚Äù *In the fourth edition of her book How I Learn Languages (1995), she writes:Hungarian edition, 1995, p. 29; English translation, 2nd ed., 2008, p. 49 :‚ÄúI would simply like to tell how I, over 25 years, got to the point of being able to speak 10 languages, translate technical documents and enjoy fiction in six more, and understand written journalism in 11 more or so.‚Äù *In her book Harmony of Babel (1988), she writes:Hungarian edition: 1988, page 137; English translation, p. 138 :‚ÄúHow many languages do I speak? I have only one mother tongue: Hungarian. I speak Russian, German, English, and French well enough to be able to interpret or translate between any of them extemporaneously. I have to prepare a bit for Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish. At such times I leaf through the parts of my diaries written in these languages. I can read Swedish, Norwegian, Romanian, Portuguese, Dutch, Bulgarian, and Czech literature; I can translate their written‚Äîpolitical or technical‚Äîtexts.‚Äù As it can be seen, Danish, Hebrew, Latin, Slovak, and Ukrainian are mentioned only in the Hetek interview, whereas Czech, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Swedish are only in the Harmony of Babel. (Although Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are close to each other, as well as Czech and Slovak, or Portuguese and Spanish, or Ukrainian and Russian are.) The languages listed at all places: * in the first place, English, German, French, and Russian (of course apart from her native Hungarian) ‚Äì five languages in which she professed to be truly proficient; * in the second place, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish ‚Äì five more languages, in which she was able to interpret too (after some preparation); * additionally, at a lower level, Romanian and Bulgarian; * and apart from these, five more languages are mentioned at both places (see above); which gives altogether 22 languages. In Polyglot: How I Learn Languages, she refers to more languages she also understood. Including these, she claimed to know at least 28 languages (including Hungarian) at least at a level enabling her to comprehend written texts, out of which languages she was able to interpret in 10. According to her account, she acquired the languages above in this order: French (at elementary school, at the age of approx. 10‚Äì14); Latin (before and/or partly during her university studies); English (from 1933, on her own; this was when she developed her subsequent method of learning languages); Russian (from 1941, on her own; enabled her to understand Ukrainian, as well as Bulgarian at some extent); Romanian (on her own); Chinese (approx. from 1950, in two years, at a university courseMore information in Hungarian about her studies: The history of the (Chinese) Department); Polish (around 1955, at a course); Japanese (from 1956, on her own); Czech (1954, on her own; similar to Slovak); Italian (on her own, after some antecedents in the 1940s); Spanish (in the second half of the 1960, on her own); German.√çgy tanulok nyelveket [How I Learn Languages], 1st edition, El≈ësz√≥ [Foreword], pp. 5‚Äì22. Years can often be inferred from the text.  Her language learning method and principles Kat√≥ Lomb (2010). 2nd ed. Polyglot: How I Learn Languages. Berkeley: TESL-EJ. P. 176 Her keyword was most of all interest: the word, coming from Latin interesse (originally meaning \\"to be between\\"), has a double meaning, referring to the material profit or the mental attraction, together: motivation. This means that I can answer these questions: \\"How much am I interested in it? What do I want with it? What does it mean for me? What good is it for me?\\" She didn't believe in the so-called language talent. She tended to express the language skill and its fruitfulness with a fraction, with motivation in the numerator (as well as invested time, although if there is true motivation, one can pinch off some ten minutes a day even with the busiest job), and inhibition in the denominator (the fear of starting to speak, of being clumsy, of being laughed at). In her conviction, the stronger the motivation is within us, and the more we can put aside inhibition, the sooner we can take possession of the language. As she put it, she drove three autos in the world of languages, namely autolexia, autographia and autologia. (Out of the elements of these words, coming from Greek, auto- means self, and ‚Äëlexia, ‚Äëgraphia and ‚Äëlogia refers to reading, writing and speaking respectively.) Autolexia means reading for myself: the book I discover by myself, which provides novelties again and again, which I can take with me anywhere, which won't get tired of being asked questions. Autographia means writing for myself, when I try to write about my thoughts, experiences, everyday things in the very language I'm just learning, no matter if it's silly, no matter if it's incorrect, no matter if a word or two is left out. Autologia means speaking with myself, when I try to express my thoughts or what I see on the street in the language I'm studying, when I keep on chatting to myself. Even she was bored with the fabricated dialogues of coursebooks, so her favourite method was to obtain an original novel in a language completely unknown to her, whose topic she personally found interesting (a detective story, a love story, or even a technical description would do), and that was how she deciphered, unravelled the basics of the language: the essence of the grammar and the most important words. She didn't let herself be set back by rare or complicated expressions: she skipped them, saying: what is important will sooner or later emerge again and will explain itself if necessary. (\\"It's much more of a problem if the book becomes flavourless in our hands due to the many interruptions than not learning if the inspector watches the murderer from behind a blackthorn or a hawthorn.\\") So we don't really need to look up each and every word in the dictionary: it only spoils our mood from the joy of reading and discovering the texts. In any case, what we can remember is what we have figured out ourselves. For this purpose, she always bought her own copies of books, since while reading she wrote on the edge of the pages what she had understood from the text by herself. This way one cannot avoid picking up something of a language‚Äîas one can't rest until one has learnt who the murderer is, or whether the girl says yes in the end. (This method was, incidentally, applied successfully even before her, by a Hungarian writer, Dezs≈ë Kosztol√°nyi as well: according to his account, he studied Portuguese practically exactly the same way during a holiday of his.) Another keyword of hers was context (she was playfully called Kati Kontext herself): on the one hand, in understanding a text (be it a book or a heard text) the context is relevant, it can help us several times if we don't understand something; on the other hand, she never studied words separately, isolated, but they either remained in her mind based on the text she read or the context she encountered (which is perhaps the best possible way of learning), or she memorized them embedded in phrases (e.g. high wind, keen wind), so if one comes to forget one of them, the other word often used together with it will trigger the former. From adjectival phrases we can even recall the gender in many cases. Kat√≥ Lomb recommended using patterns, templates, \\"shoemaker's lasts\\" or \\"cookie-cutters\\" elsewhere as well: these are simple, skeletonized sample sentences for a structure or an idiom, elements which can be inserted into the speech like prefabricated slabs (generally in the first person singular), by applying them we can more easily construct even fairly complicated structures. She didn't let herself be put off from her set objective by mistakes, failures or the ceaseless demand of perfection, but she always clung to the joyful, enjoyable side of language studies‚Äîmaybe that's where her success lay. She besieged the fortress of language again and again in a thousand and one ways. Her saying may be useful for those less confident of themselves: \\"Language is the only thing worth knowing even poorly\\" (in Hungarian: \\"A nyelv az egyetlen, amit rosszul is √©rdemes tudni\\"). Quotes :Szilard Kato, the daughter of a prominent local physician, was born and raised in Pecs, where she went to the University to earn her degrees. She moved to Budapest after age 21, where she met and married Laub (later the family changed the name to Lomb) Frigyes, an engineer from a prominent family of electrical engineers. As a young adult, she became interested in other languages while in the family's bomb shelter as Russian troops were advancing on Budapest. She was quoted by her family as having said the following: \\"Kids, we are going to have to learn Russian now...\\". She managed to acquire a Russian typewriter and started learning the language. This single step started her on the road to a long and illustrious career in languages. As the Russian occupation unfolded, she served for a time as the translator for the Russian Commander of Budapest. In later years she became a professional interpreter. She acquired high levels of proficiency in 17 languages without extended stays in the countries where the languages were spoken. I interviewed Dr. Lomb (her PhD was in Chemistry) in depth ten years ago in Budapest. She attributed her success to massive amounts of comprehensible input, mostly through recreational reading. She was personally very interested in grammar and linguistics but felt they played a small role in language acquisition, loved dictionaries but looked up words when she read only if the word re-appeared several times and she still did not understand it, and hated to be corrected: \\"Error correction makes you sick to your stomach.\\" :References: :Krashen, S. and Kiss, N. 1996.

Ron Hubbard in 1977. It tells the space opera story of how an evil galactic dictator, named Xenu, massacres many of his subjects by transporting them to Earth and killing them with atomic bombs. L. Ron Hubbard had already presented this story to his followers, as a true account of events that happened 75 million years ago, in a secret level of Scientology scripture called Operating Thetan, Level III. The screenplay was promoted around Hollywood circles in 1979, but attempts at fundraising and obtaining financing fell through, and the film was never made. Unofficial copies circulate on the Internet. Plot In the screenplay's story, which takes place 75 million years before modern times, an evil galactic ruler, named Xenu, massacres millions of people with assistance from Chu, the Executive President of the Galactic Interplanetary Bank, and Chi, the Galactic Minister of Police. Xenu's psychiatric advisers, Stug and Sty, help him gather \\"unwanted\\" beings from all of the planets in his control and transport them to Earth. The beings are stacked around the bases of Earth's volcanoes including Loa, Mount Vesuvius, Mount Shasta, Mount Fuji, Mount Etna and others, and exterminated by detonating planted charges of atomic bombs. In his script, Hubbard wrote: \\"great winds raced simultaneously across the face of Earth, spreading tales of destruction...\\" Xenu's massacre of these beings is called \\"Phase III.\\" A character named Mish is one of the only \\"Loyal Officers\\" who survives Xenu's organized massacre, and other characters include Lady Min and a hero figure, Rawl. Connection to Scientology teachings The story of Revolt in the Stars provides a dramatized account of events which Hubbard said took place 75 million years ago. In Scientology space opera theology, the villain Xenu (or \\"Xemu\\") addressed an over-population problem in his Galactic Confederacy by trapping beings, flying them to the volcanoes of Earth, then known as \\"Teegeeack\\", and exterminating all of them by detonating hydrogen bombs. The spirits, which Hubbard refers to as \\"thetans,\\" were trapped in frozen alcohol and glycol and implanted with bizarre imagery. According to the story, they subsequently became attached to present-day human beings, in the form of \\"body thetans.\\" Scientology teachings identify this event as \\"Incident II.\\" Scientologists learn from OT III that by removing body thetans, they can progress spiritually and free themselves of problems. Belief in the reality of Xenu and body thetans is a condition for progressing beyond OT III along Scientology's Bridge to Total Freedom. Development Hubbard wrote the screenplay in 1977, while living in seclusion in Sparks, Nevada with three members of the Commodore's Messenger Organization from the Church of Scientology. He went into seclusion in July 1977, and by December of that year, he had finished his work on the 140-page screenplay and was ready to begin the production of a film version.

A former Scientologist and Sea Org member told the Los Angeles Business Journal that Hubbard intended to distribute the film publicly so that people inhabited with thetans would become \\"restimulated and upset,\\" and be motivated to learn more about Scientology. Hubbard moved to the Scientology facilities at La Quinta, California and began production on Scientology \\"Tech films\\" which demonstrated the practice of \\"Auditing.\\" A ranch in Indio, California was purchased in addition to a ranch called Silver. The Tech films were produced at the Silver location, and by 1980 Hubbard had made plans to film Revolt in the Stars and publicize the Scientology OT III theology. Hubbard's screenplay for Revolt in the Stars was passed around Hollywood in 1978. A production company called \\"A Brilliant Film Company\\"Henderson, Gregory F. v. A Brilliant Film Co. et al. No. 164213. California Superior Court, San Joaquin County, California. Filed May 14, 1982 and also called \\"Brilliant Films\\" announced plans, in October 1979, to produce Revolt in the Stars as an independent film production. The New York Post reported that the film had a US$49 million budget, and was described as \\"a science fiction thriller.\\" Bent Corydon writes in L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman? that millions of dollars in funding for film production of Revolt in the Stars was raised from investors, but he adds: \\"highly questionable methods of fund raising brought the project to a halt.\\" Efforts to promote the screenplay and get it developed as a film were unsuccessful, and Hubbard focused on writing \\"Man, the Endangered Species\\" which later became the novel Battlefield Earth. This was produced as a feature film in 2000, starring John Travolta as one of the villains, but it drew hostile critical response and performed poorly at the box office. Author Services Inc., the for profit subsidiary company of the Church of Spiritual Technology, controls development of Revolt in the Stars in addition to Hubbard's other writings. In a 1983 press release announcing that the independent feature film company Salem Productions Inc. had acquired motion picture and ancillary rights to Battlefield Earth in a deal with Author Services Inc., Revolt in the Stars is listed as one of Hubbard's \\"classics.\\" Copyright was transferred in 1993 with the Church of Spiritual Technology and trustee for L. Ron Hubbard, Norman F. Starkey, listed as parties.United States Copyright Office - Model of OT ship organization and operation based on 7 division system & 7,730 other titles.

Party 2: Church of Spiritual Technology (Los Angeles) Scientologist and actor John Travolta was involved in developing Battlefield Earth into a film of the same name, and in 1996 New York Daily News wrote of reports that he also wanted to develop Revolt in the Stars into a film. According to the website Operation Clambake a synopsis of the screenplay was posted to the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology in 1995. Scientology critic Grady Ward published a summary of the material. The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements notes that Revolt in the Stars remains one of Hubbard's unpublished science fiction works but unofficial copies circulate on the Internet, and this is confirmed in The Encyclopedic Sourcebook of UFO Religions by James R. Lewis, and New Religions: A Guide, edited by Christopher Partridge. Analysis In The Encyclopedic Sourcebook of UFO Religions, James R. Lewis cites Revolt in the Stars when comparing Hubbard's science fiction works to Scientology. \\"Scientology in itself would also be an interesting case for studying 'ufological' strands - e.g., the relation between L. Ron Hubbard's science fiction novels and the Whole Track mythology, which is probably most evident in the case of Hubbard's unpublished novel Revolt in the Stars,\\" writes Lewis. Revolt in the Stars is cited in New Religions: A Guide, in a subsection on \\"Non apocalyptic ufology\\": \\"According to Scientology, a fierce intergalactic ruler named 'Xenu' carried the thetans to Earth.\\" The author finds it interesting that L. Ron Hubbard explored the story of the \\"ancient ruler Xenu\\" further in the form of Revolt in the Stars. The Washington Post reported that \\"The plot of 'Revolt' mirrors a sacred Scientology text called 'OT III.'\\" Former Scientologist Gerry Armstrong said that the screenplay story is identical to the Scientology space opera theology, and in his book Bare-faced Messiah author Russell Miller described Revolt in the Stars as \\"...a dramatization of high-level Scientology training about events which happened seventy-five million years ago when an evil ruler by the name of Xenu massacred the populations of seventy-six planets, transported their frozen spirits back to earth and exploded them in volcanoes.\\" Jim Emerson, editor of the Roger Ebert website hosted by the Chicago Sun-Times, compared elements of the Xenu story and Revolt in the Stars to the 2005 film remake War of the Worlds starring Scientologist Tom Cruise. Emerson noted that some critics drew parallels between War of the Worlds and Scientology mythology. In a January 2008 article in Frankfurter Rundschau, Christian Schl√ºter commented on the screenplay and recounted the Xenu story. Schl√ºter wrote that the Scientology mythology was appropriate for cinema and fit into the environment of Hollywood.
