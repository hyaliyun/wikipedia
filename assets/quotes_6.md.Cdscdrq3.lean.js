The station was opened by the Mawddwy Railway in 1867 and closed to all goods traffic in 1908. The railway re-opened in 1911 with all services run by the Cambrian Railways. It was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway in 1923 as part of the grouping of British railways, and remained open to passenger and freight traffic until 1931 and 1952, respectively. The station was the transshipment point between the branch and the Hendre-Ddu Tramway. History The Mawddwy Railway was first opened in 1867, however it was closed to passenger traffic in 1901, and closed to all goods traffic in 1908. It reopened on 31 July 1911 as a light railway system, as a result of the support of several local councils. The railway was incorporated, as part of the Cambrian Railways, into the Great Western Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The railway closed its passenger services in 1931, although the line continued to remain open for freight traffic until 1952. The station served local passenger needs. There was also a thriving goods service, with parcels and farm machinery delivered by the Mawddwy Railway and livestock being sent away from the station. The Hendre Ddu Tramway connected a number of local slate quarries to the station, where a wharf was provided to unload slate onto Mawdwwy Railway wagons. During the First World War a great deal of timber was felled in the forests west of Aberangell. This was sawn into pit props and sent down the Hendre Ddu Tramway to be shipped out on the standard gauge railway. This timber traffic continued into the early 1920s. Some logs were shipped to Dinas Mawddwy where a sawmill processed them into timber. The Hendre Ddu Tramway closed in 1939. During the Second World War ammunition was stored in the Hendreddu Slate Quarry, arriving by Great Western Railway trains and being taken by lorry along the tramway trackbed to the quarry.

It is often referred to, incorrectly, as a formula for particle size measurement or analysis. It is named after Paul Scherrer.P. Scherrer, G√∂ttinger Nachrichten Gesell., Vol. 2, 1918, p 98. It is used in the determination of size of crystals in the form of powder. The Scherrer equation can be written as: :\\\\tau = \\\\frac {K \\\\lambda}{\\\\beta \\\\cos \\\\theta} where: * \\\\tau is the mean size of the ordered (crystalline) domains, which may be smaller or equal to the grain size, which may be smaller or equal to the particle size; * K is a dimensionless shape factor, with a value close to unity. The shape factor has a typical value of about 0.9, but varies with the actual shape of the crystallite; * \\\\lambda is the X-ray wavelength; * \\\\beta is the line broadening at half the maximum intensity (FWHM), after subtracting the instrumental line broadening, in radians. This quantity is also sometimes denoted as \\\\Delta\\\\left( 2\\\\theta\\\\right); * \\\\theta is the Bragg angle.  Applicability  The Scherrer equation is limited to nano-scale crystallites, or more-strictly, the coherently scattering domain size, which can be smaller than the crystallite size (due to factors mentioned below). It is not applicable to grains larger than about 0.1 to 0.2 Œºm, which precludes those observed in most metallographic and ceramographic microstructures. It is important to realize that the Scherrer formula provides a lower bound on the coherently scattering domain size, referred to here as the crystallite size for readability. The reason for this is that a variety of factors can contribute to the width of a diffraction peak besides instrumental effects and crystallite size; the most important of these are usually inhomogeneous strain and crystal lattice imperfections. The following sources of peak broadening are dislocations, stacking faults, twinning, microstresses, grain boundaries, sub-boundaries, coherency strain, chemical heterogeneities, and crystallite smallness. These and other imperfections may also result in peak shift, peak asymmetry, anisotropic peak broadening, or other peak shape effects.A.K. Singh (ed.), \\"Advanced X-ray Techniques in Research And Industries\\", Ios Pr Inc, 2005. If all of these other contributions to the peak width, including instrumental broadening, were zero, then the peak width would be determined solely by the crystallite size and the Scherrer formula would apply. If the other contributions to the width are non-zero, then the crystallite size can be larger than that predicted by the Scherrer formula, with the \\"extra\\" peak width coming from the other factors. The concept of crystallinity can be used to collectively describe the effect of crystal size and imperfections on peak broadening. Although \\"particle size\\" is often used in reference to crystallite size, this term should not be used in association with the Scherrer method because particles are often agglomerations of many crystallites, and XRD gives no information on the particle size. Other techniques, such as sieving, image analysis, or visible light scattering do directly measure particle size. The crystallite size can be thought of as a lower limit of particle size.https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/16/5415#cite  Derivation for a simple stack of planes  To see where the Scherrer equation comes from, it is useful to consider the simplest possible example: a set of N planes separated by the distance, a. The derivation for this simple, effectively one-dimensional case, is straightforward. First, the structure factor for this case is derived, and then an expression for the peak widths is determined.  Structure factor for a set of N equally spaced planes  This system, effectively a one dimensional perfect crystal, has a structure factor or scattering function S(q): S(q) = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{j,k=1}^N \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i q(x_j-x_k)} where for N planes, x_j=aj: S(q) = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{k=1}^N \\\\mathrm{e}^{-iqak}\\\\times \\\\sum_{j=1}^N \\\\mathrm{e}^{iqaj} thumbStructure factor S(qa) for N = 31 planes. Shown are the first and second Bragg peaks. It is worth noting that for a perfect but finite lattice, all peaks are identical. In particular, the peaks all have the same width. Also, the central part (between bracketing zeros) of each peak is close to a Gaussian function, but the envelope of the small oscillations either side of this peak is a Lorentzian function. each sum is a simple geometric series, defining y=\\\\exp(iqa), \\\\sum_{j=1}^N y^j=(y-y^{N+1})/(1-y), and the other series analogously gives: S(q)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\frac{\\\\left[{\\\\rm e}^{-iqa}-{\\\\rm e}^{-iqa(N+1)}\\\\right]}{\\\\left[1-e^{-iqa}\\\\right]}\\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\left[{\\\\rm e}^{iqa}-{\\\\rm e}^{iqa(N+1)}\\\\right]}{\\\\left[1-e^{iqa}\\\\right]} S(q)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\frac{2-{\\\\rm e}^{iqaN}-{\\\\rm e}^{-iqaN}}{2-{\\\\rm e}^{iqa}-{\\\\rm e}^{-iqa}} which is further simplified by converting to trigonometric functions: S(q) = \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\frac{1-\\\\cos[Nqa]}{1-\\\\cos[qa]} and finally: S(q) = \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\frac{\\\\sin^2[Nqa/2]}{\\\\sin^2[qa/2]} which gives a set of peaks at q_P=0, 2\\\\pi/a, 4\\\\pi/a, \\\\ldots, all with heights S(q_P)=N.  Determination of the profile near the peak, and hence the peak width  From the definition of FWHM, for a peak at q_P and with a FWHM of \\\\Delta q, S(q_P\\\\pm\\\\Delta q/2)=S(q_P)/2=N/2, as the peak height is N. If we take the plus sign (peak is symmetric so either sign will do) S(q_P+\\\\Delta q/2)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\frac{\\\\sin^2[Na(q_P+\\\\Delta q/2)/2]}{\\\\sin^2[a(q_P+\\\\Delta q/2)/2]}=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\sin[Na(q_P+\\\\Delta q/2)/2]}{\\\\sin[a(q_P+\\\\Delta q/2)/2]}\\\\right]^2=N/2 and \\\\frac{\\\\sin[Na(q_P+\\\\Delta q/2)/2]}{\\\\sin[a(q_P+\\\\Delta q/2)/2]} =\\\\frac{\\\\sin[Na\\\\Delta q/4]}{\\\\sin[a\\\\Delta q/4]} =\\\\frac{N}{2^{1/2}} if N is not too small. If \\\\Delta q is small , then \\\\sin[\\\\Delta qa/4]\\\\simeq \\\\Delta qa/4, and we can write the equation as a single non-linear equation \\\\sin(x)-(x/2^{1/2})=0, for x=Na\\\\Delta q/4. The solution to this equation is x=1.39. Therefore, the size of the set of planes is related to the FWHM in q by \\\\tau=Na=\\\\frac{5.56}{\\\\Delta q} To convert to an expression for crystal size in terms of the peak width in the scattering angle 2\\\\theta used in X-ray powder diffraction, we note that the scattering vector q=(4\\\\pi/\\\\lambda)\\\\sin(\\\\theta/2), where the \\\\theta here is the angle between the incident wavevector and the scattered wavevector, which is different from the \\\\theta in the 2\\\\theta scan. Then the peak width in the variable 2\\\\theta is approximately \\\\beta\\\\simeq 2\\\\Delta q /[{\\\\rm d}q/{\\\\rm d} \\\\theta]=2\\\\Delta q/[(4\\\\pi/\\\\lambda)\\\\cos(\\\\theta)], and so \\\\tau=Na=\\\\frac{5.56\\\\lambda}{2\\\\pi\\\\beta\\\\cos(\\\\theta)}=\\\\frac{0.88\\\\lambda}{\\\\beta\\\\cos(\\\\theta)} which is the Scherrer equation with K = 0.88. This only applies to a perfect 1D set of planes. In the experimentally relevant 3D case, the form of S(q) and hence the peaks, depends on the crystal lattice type, and the size and shape of the nanocrystallite. The underlying mathematics becomes more involved than in this simple illustrative example. However, for simple lattices and shapes, expressions have been obtained for the FWHM, for example by Patterson. Just as in 1D, the FWHM varies as the inverse of the characteristic size. For example, for a spherical crystallite with a cubic lattice, the factor of 5.56 simply becomes 6.96, when the size is the diameter D, i.e., the diameter of a spherical nanocrystal is related to the peak FWHM by D=\\\\frac{6.96}{\\\\Delta q} or in \\\\theta: D=\\\\frac{1.11\\\\lambda}{\\\\beta\\\\cos(\\\\theta)}  Peak broadening due to disorder of the second kind  The finite size of a crystal is not the only possible reason for broadened peaks in X-ray diffraction. Fluctuations of atoms about the ideal lattice positions that preserve the long-range order of the lattice only give rise to the Debye-Waller factor, which reduces peak heights but does not broaden them. However, fluctuations that cause the correlations between nearby atoms to decrease as their separation increases, does broaden peaks. This can be studied and quantified using the same simple one-dimensional stack of planes as above. The derivation follows that in chapter 9 of Guinier's textbook. This model was pioneered by and applied to a number of materials by Hosemann and collaborators over a number of years. They termed this disorder of the second kind, and referred to this imperfect crystalline ordering as paracrystalline ordering. Disorder of the first kind is the source of the Debye-Waller factor. To derive the model we start with the definition of the structure factor S(q) = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{j,k=1}^N \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i q(x_j-x_k)} but now we want to consider, for simplicity an infinite crystal, i.e., N\\\\to\\\\infty, and we want to consider pairs of lattice sites. For large N, for each of these N planes, there are two neighbours m planes away, so the above double sum becomes a single sum over pairs of neighbours either side of an atom, at positions -m and m lattice spacings away, times N. So, then S(q) = 1+ \\\\frac{2}{N} \\\\sum_{m=1}^N\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}{\\\\rm d}(\\\\Delta x)p_m(\\\\Delta x)\\\\cos\\\\left(mq\\\\Delta x\\\\right) where p_m(\\\\Delta x) is the probability density function for the separation \\\\Delta x of a pair of planes, m lattice spacings apart. For the separation of neighbouring planes we assume for simplicity that the fluctuations around the mean neighbour spacing of a are Gaussian, i.e., that p_1(\\\\Delta x)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\left(2\\\\pi\\\\sigma_2^2\\\\right)^{1/2}} \\\\exp\\\\left[-\\\\left(\\\\Delta x-a\\\\right)^2/(2\\\\sigma_2^2)\\\\right] and we also assume that the fluctuations between a plane and its neighbour, and between this neighbour and the next plane, are independent. Then p_2(\\\\Delta x) is just the convolution of two p_1(\\\\Delta x)s, etc. As the convolution of two Gaussians is just another Gaussian, we have that p_m(\\\\Delta x)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\left(2\\\\pi m\\\\sigma_2^2\\\\right)^{1/2}} \\\\exp\\\\left[-\\\\left(\\\\Delta x-ma\\\\right)^2/(2m\\\\sigma_2^2)\\\\right] The sum in S(q) is then just a sum of Fourier Transforms of Gaussians, and so S(q)=1+2\\\\sum_{m=1}^{\\\\infty}r^m \\\\cos\\\\left(mqa\\\\right) for r=\\\\exp[-q^2\\\\sigma_2^2/2]. The sum is just the real part of the sum \\\\sum_{m=1}^{\\\\infty} [r\\\\exp(iqa)]^m and so the structure factor of the infinite but disordered crystal is S(q)=\\\\frac{1-r^2}{1+r^2-2r\\\\cos(qa)} This has peaks at maxima q_p=2n\\\\pi/a, where\\\\cos(q_Pa)=1. These peaks have heights S(q_P)=\\\\frac{1+r}{1-r}\\\\approx\\\\frac{4}{q_P^2\\\\sigma_2^2}=\\\\frac{a^2}{n^2\\\\pi^2\\\\sigma_2^2} i.e., the height of successive peaks drop off as the order of the peak (and so q) squared. Unlike finite-size effects that broaden peaks but do not decrease their height, disorder lowers peak heights. Note that here we assuming that the disorder is relatively weak, so that we still have relatively well defined peaks. This is the limit q\\\\sigma_2\\\\ll 1, where r\\\\simeq 1-q^2\\\\sigma_2^2/2. In this limit, near a peak we can approximate \\\\cos(qa)\\\\simeq 1-(\\\\Delta q)^2a^2/2, with\\\\Delta q=q-q_P and obtain S(q)\\\\approx\\\\frac{S(q_P)} {1+\\\\frac{r}{(1-r)^2}\\\\Delta q^2a^2} \\\\approx \\\\frac{S(q_P)}{1+\\\\frac{\\\\Delta q^2}{[q_P^2\\\\sigma_2^2/2a]^2}} which is a Lorentzian or Cauchy function, of FWHM q_P^2\\\\sigma_2^2/a=4\\\\pi^2n^2(\\\\sigma_2/a)^2/a, i.e., the FWHM increases as the square of the order of peak, and so as the square of the wavector q at the peak. Finally, the product of the peak height and the FWHM is constant and equals 4/a, in the q\\\\sigma_2\\\\ll 1 limit. For the first few peaks where n is not large, this is just the \\\\sigma_2/a\\\\ll 1 limit. Thus finite-size and this type of disorder both cause peak broadening, but there are qualitative differences. Finite-size effects broadens all peaks equally, and does not affect peak heights, while this type of disorder both reduces peak heights and broadens peaks by an amount that increases as n^2. This, in principle, allows the two effects to be distinguished. Also, it means that the Scherrer equation is best applied to the first peak, as disorder of this type affects the first peak the least.  Coherence length  Within this model the degree of correlation between a pair of planes decreases as the distance between these planes increases, i.e., a pair of planes 10 planes apart have positions that are more weakly correlated than a pair of planes that are nearest neighbours. The correlation is given by p_m, for a pair of planes m planes apart. For sufficiently large m the pair of planes are essentially uncorrelated, in the sense that the uncertainty in their relative positions is so large that it is comparable to the lattice spacing, a. This defines a correlation length, \\\\lambda, defined as the separation when the width of p_m, which is m^{1/2}\\\\sigma_2 equals a. This gives \\\\lambda=\\\\frac{a^3}{\\\\sigma_2^2} which is in effect an order-of-magnitude estimate for the size of domains of coherent crystalline lattices. Note that the FWHM of the first peak scales as \\\\sigma_2^2/a^3, so the coherence length is approximately 1/FWHM for the first peak.  Further reading  * B.D. Cullity & S.R.

Walker (May 31, 1885 ‚Äì December 1, 1954) was a farmer, provincial- level politician and World War I-era soldier. He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1940 to 1944. During that time he served as official opposition leader twice and was leader of the Independents.  Early life  Walker served in World War I. He attained the rank of Major and ran in the 1917 Alberta general election soldiers and nurses vote. In that vote he finished in eighth place out of 21 candidates. He was involved in large scale farming in Raymond, Alberta. He specialized in growing sugar beets, and became chairman of the Beet Growing Industry. He also primarily raised sheep on his farm.  Political career  Walker would return to provincial politics running as a United Farmers of Alberta candidate in the 1935 Alberta general election. He was defeated by Social Credit candidate Solon Earl Low, finishing a distant second place, but still ahead of incumbent Frank Leffingwell. Walker himself would run for a second time in the Warner electoral district against Low. He was an Independent candidate this time around and defeated Low. Walker would run for leadership of the Independent Citizen's Association and defeat David Elton on a first ballot win at Calgary on January 23, 1944. His win would make him the first permanent leader of the Independents. Walker had trouble gaining traction as leader. Prior to the start of the 4th Legislative session, the Independents lost two caucus members who joined Joseph Trembley to sit in the Assembly as Liberals. The Independents, despite knowing about the timing of the 1944 Alberta general election well in advance, failed to field a full slate of candidates. The party and Walker were criticized heavily as being unable to form government and unable to be a viable alternative. On elections night, Social Credit under Ernest Manning surged in popularity and the Independents were returned in just three seats. Walker was personally defeated in his own electoral district by Low and did not return to provincial politics.

It was given a ship's name as a stone frigate. History With the outbreak of the Second World War and the start of the Battle of the Atlantic, the Admiralty decided to develop a large new naval base in Northern Ireland to serve as a base for convoy escorts, providing repair and refuelling facilities. Derry was selected as a prime location due to Londonderry Port being the UK's most westerly port it provided the fastest access into the Atlantic. Royal Navy warships could then quickly come to the aid of convoys under attack by German U-boats, and help to escort the convoys in and out of British ports. Part of Ebrington Barracks was handed over to the Royal Navy in mid-1941 and the entire barracks came under Admiralty command in 1943 as RN Barracks Ebrington, part of the Londonderry shore base known as HMS Ferret.Ward, Shore establishments p. 75. The old North of Ireland shipyard at Pennyburn was also taken over to be used as a ship repair facility, manned by workers from the Harland and Wolff yard at Belfast. Ships based at Ferret were under the operational control of Western Approaches Command, located in Plymouth for the early part of the war. The main headquarters for the Western Approaches Command was moved to Liverpool in February 1941 as the North Western Approaches became the most vital area of convoy activity.A history of Ebrington Barracks Ferret was then the backup for the Liverpool headquarters, with the other main bases in the area being at Greenock, and later at Belfast. The organisational function of Ferret was to form escort groups of the warships based there, mostly small destroyers, frigates, corvettes and armed trawlers. From 1 February 1941 these craft had a separate accounting system from the main base. By 1942 this system had been extended to handle the accounts of Royal Navy ships based at St' John's and Argentia. A Coastal Forces base was established in April 1941, under the name HMS Ferret II. American presence The Destroyers for Bases Agreement was finalised between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt in September 1940, and fifty ageing American destroyers were transferred to the Royal Navy as the Town class, in return for bases across the empire. As part of the deal four hundred American technicians were transferred to HMS Ferret, arriving on 30 June 1941 and started working in civilian clothes as America was not officially at war. The American personnel later moved out of Ferret and into camps constructed in the area, and on 5 February 1942 a US base was officially established. US Marines also arrived, and were used to guard the camps and the main base, as well as outlying ammunition dumps. In November 1942 Eleanor Roosevelt visited the base, accompanied by Lady Montgomery, the mother of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. Later developments By 1942 Beech Hill Camp had been commissioned as HMS Ferret III, and the base had become an important centre for anti-submarine training. British and other allied submarines were sometimes used to simulate real conditions. New technological developments were also worked on to improve anti-U-boat measures. One of the innovations developed here was the Squid Mortar. The base became an important centre to train new crews, and refit ships transferred from America with the more effective British developments. Some buildings were set aside to train crews in how to handle objects on deck, one building had a full cross-section of a destroyer's deck built inside it. Surrender of the U-boats A mass of surrendered German U-boats at their mooring at Lisahally, Northern Ireland. There are nine Type XXIs (1,600 tons carrying 23 torpedoes), four Type IXs (500 tons) and thirty-nine of the Type VIIs (also 500 tons), a total of fifty- two U-boats. After the end of the war, large numbers of captured German U-boats were surrendered to British forces on the Scottish and Irish coasts and were brought to Lisahally. The American base had been transferred to the Royal Navy on 31 October 1944 and then closed on 2 September 1944. The site was commissioned in May 1945 as HMS Ferret IV specifically for the internment. Eventually nearly sixty U-boats were brought in to Ferret IV. After a period of study and other trials, many were sunk off Lisahally and Loch Ryan during late 1945 and 1946 in Operation Deadlight. After this had been completed, Ferret IV was paid off to care and maintenance on 19 July 1946. Postwar Eventually over twenty thousand allied troops and sailors had passed through Ferret, and the base had been home to over two hundred ships of the Royal Navy, US Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy, as well as ships from the Free French and Free Dutch naval forces and some ships of the Royal Indian Marine. There was a debate over the future of the base, but the Admiralty decided to retain the property but to convert it into a proper school for anti-submarine warfare training. There had been plans to commission the establishment under the name HMS Phoenix, but this was changed in preference to HMS Sea Eagle. Ferret was paid off on 21 July 1947, and HMS Sea Eagle commissioned that same day. Assessment Professor J. W. Blake, in his 1956 book Northern Ireland and the Second World War summarised the importance of the work of HMS Ferret: > \\"Londonderry held the key to victory in the Atlantic. It became our most > westerly base for the repair, the working up and refuelling of destroyers, > corvettes and frigates. By that critical Spring (1943) when battle for the > security of our Atlantic lifelines finally turned our way, Londonderry was > the most important escort base in the north-western approaches.\\" References *Warlow, Ben, Shore Establishments of the Royal Navy, Liskeard : Maritime, 2000. *Blake, J.W.

Early life Robert Allan Hale was the son of Virginia and I. B. Hale. He had a twin brother, Billy, and younger brother, Tommy. He grew up in Fort Worth, Texas and attended Arlington Heights High School. As an 18-year- old senior, Hale eloped in Ardmore, Oklahoma with 16-year-old Kathleen \\"K.K.\\" Connally, the daughter of future Texas governor John Connally. On March 16, 1959, the couple were married in Ardmore prior to moving into an apartment in Tallahassee, Florida. Hale worked for a boat company earning $75 per week. The couple had been married only 44 days when Kathleen died after a 20-gauge shotgun discharged behind her right ear on April 28, 1959. Hale spent that night in jail; police reported that he was held in \\"protective custody\\" pending the ruling of a coroner's jury. On April 29, Hale testified that Kathleen had left their apartment after an argument on the evening of April 27 and did not return until noon the following day. According to Hale, he spent the night looking for her and returned to find her sitting on a couch holding the gun. He said that his wife was about to commit suicide and that the gun discharged when he lunged at it. Both fathers testified at the inquest; John Connally stated that his daughter was pregnant and had been despondent over the move to Florida. After 45 minutes of deliberations, Hale was cleared of responsibility for Kathleen's death when the jury ruled it to be an accident. Other legal troubles and death On August 7, 1962, before living in Alaska, Hale and his twin brother \\"Billy\\" Hale were observed by an FBI agent as they burgled the Los Angeles apartment of Judith Exner, who later claimed to be a mistress of President John F. Kennedy. In 1974, Robert Hale (then going by the name \\"Sunstar\\") met 16-year-old Kurina Rose Bresler in the California desert. She would later call herself \\"Country Rose\\" and bear Hale 15 children. Hale had gained notoriety through his family's iconoclastic lifestyle. A self- proclaimed devout Christian, Hale moved his family of 17 to Alaska from New Mexico in 1998 and kept them isolated from nearly all outside influences, including churches. In 2002, Hale launched a legal battle with the National Park Service over his plan to bulldoze a road to his 410-acre ranch (\\"Hillbilly Heaven\\") inside the remote Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, near the small town of McCarthy, Alaska. He lost his case at the US Court of Appeals (9th Cir., San Francisco). He appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Court refused to hear it. In 2005, family members told police that Hale had routinely beaten and raped his eldest daughter for years. He was incarcerated in September 2007 and died eight months later on May 26, 2008. He was a diabetic and had been in poor health since at least 2006. Hale was mentioned in Seymour Hersh's 1997 book The Dark Side of Camelot. In 2013 a book was published by Tom Kizzia titled Pilgrim's Wilderness: A True Story of Faith and Madness on the Alaska Frontier, chronicling Hale's life with a focus on his time in McCarthy. The initial arrival of Hale and the Pilgrim Family in McCarthy was also documented by the humourist and travel-documentarist Pete McCarthy in The Road To McCarthy (2002).

Shape factors are calculated from measured dimensions, such as diameter, chord lengths, area, perimeter, centroid, moments, etc. The dimensions of the particles are usually measured from two-dimensional cross- sections or projections, as in a microscope field, but shape factors also apply to three-dimensional objects. The particles could be the grains in a metallurgical or ceramic microstructure, or the microorganisms in a culture, for example. The dimensionless quantities often represent the degree of deviation from an ideal shape, such as a circle, sphere or equilateral polyhedron.L. Wojnar & K.J. Kurzyd≈Çowski, et al., Practical Guide to Image Analysis, ASM International, 2000, p 157-160, . Shape factors are often normalized, that is, the value ranges from zero to one. A shape factor equal to one usually represents an ideal case or maximum symmetry, such as a circle, sphere, square or cube. Aspect ratio The most common shape factor is the aspect ratio, a function of the largest diameter and the smallest diameter orthogonal to it: :A_R = \\\\frac{d_\\\\min}{d_\\\\max} The normalized aspect ratio varies from approaching zero for a very elongated particle, such as a grain in a cold-worked metal, to near unity for an equiaxed grain. The reciprocal of the right side of the above equation is also used, such that the AR varies from one to approaching infinity. Circularity Another very common shape factor is the circularity (or isoperimetric quotient), a function of the perimeter P and the area A: :f_\\\\text{circ} = \\\\frac {4 \\\\pi A} {P^2} The circularity of a circle is 1, and much less than one for a starfish footprint. The reciprocal of the circularity equation is also used, such that fcirc varies from one for a circle to infinity. Elongation shape factor The less-common elongation shape factor is defined as the square root of the ratio of the two second moments in of the particle around its principal axes.H.E. Exner & H.P. Hougardy, Quantitative Image Analysis of Microstructures, DGM Informationsgesellschaft mbH, 1988, p 33-39, . :f_\\\\text{elong} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{i_2}{i_1}} Compactness shape factor The compactness shape factor is a function of the polar second moment in of a particle and a circle of equal area A. :f_\\\\text{comp} = \\\\frac{A^2}{2 \\\\pi \\\\sqrt{{i_1}^2 + {i_2}^2}} The fcomp of a circle is one, and much less than one for the cross-section of an I-beam. Waviness shape factor The waviness shape factor of the perimeter is a function of the convex portion Pcvx of the perimeter to the total. :f_\\\\text{wav} = \\\\frac{P_\\\\text{cvx}}{P} Some properties of metals and ceramics, such as fracture toughness, have been linked to grain shapes.P.F. Becher, et al., \\"Microstructural Design of Silicon Nitride with Improved Fracture Toughness: I, Effects of Grain Shape and Size,\\" J. American Ceramic Soc., Vol 81, Issue 11, P 2821-2830, Nov 1998.T. Huang, et al., \\"Anisotropic Grain Growth and Microstructural Evolution of Dense Mullite above 1550¬∞C,\\" J.

An application of shape factors Greenland, the largest island in the world, has an area of 2,166,086 km2; a coastline (perimeter) of 39,330 km; a north-south length of 2670 km; and an east-west length of 1290 km. The aspect ratio of Greenland is :A_R = \\\\frac{1290}{2670} = 0.483 The circularity of Greenland is :f_\\\\text{circ} = \\\\frac {4 \\\\pi (2166086)} {39330^2} = 0.0176. The aspect ratio is agreeable with an eyeball-estimate on a globe. Such an estimate on a typical flat map, using the Mercator projection, would be less accurate due to the distorted scale at high latitudes. The circularity is deceptively low, due to the fjords that give Greenland a very jagged coastline (see the coastline paradox). A low value of circularity does not necessarily indicate a lack of symmetry, and shape factors are not limited to microscopic objects. References Further reading * J.C. Russ & R.T.

It is the oldest continuously running restaurant in San Francisco, having opened in 1849 as a coffee stand. In the 1920s, the Tadich Grill claimed to be the first American restaurant to grill seafood over mesquite charcoal, a traditional Croat method. History Menu, Tadich Grill, San Francisco 1983 The original restaurant opened in 1849 as a coffee stand on Clay Street in San Francisco. In 1887, John Tadich from Stari Grad (island of Hvar, Croatia)Adam S. Eterovich: Croatian Heritage Biographies S - Z purchased and renamed the restaurant after his surname. In 1928 the Buich family bought the restaurant from Tadich; they continue to own the restaurant today. In 1967 the restaurant moved to its present location at 240 California Street; this was after Wells Fargo bought the Clay Street location for redevelopment. The current space is one-third larger than the original, and the Buiches worked with contractors to recreate the Art Deco interior design that the Clay Street space had. All of the moldings and woodwork were copied, and the original Clay Street bar was moved to the present location. The restaurant reopened within one month of moving. In 1925, Louis Buich advised that the chefs use a mesquite broiler for cooking fish. A native of Croatia, Buich was familiar with the technique, as it was a traditional Croatian style. The Tadich's use of grilling became popular, and in a single day the restaurant can go through four 40-pound bags of mesquite charcoal. Little has changed in regards to the restaurant's cooking techniques, and the restaurant has had only seven chefs since 1925 (as of 2011). Today Today, the menu focuses on seafood, stews, and casserole. Ingredients are locally sourced, including seafood such as Dungeness crab and sand dab. The restaurant also offers a day-of-the-week menu, which has remained unchanged for many years. Items on the day-of-the-week menu include lamb roast on Mondays, beef tongue on Tuesdays, and corned beef and cabbage on Thursdays. Oysters are also a major feature on the menu and most, if not all, menu items are prepared in restaurant. Prawns are the only frozen fish at the restaurant, and the Tadich actively avoids selling fish that is overfished, limiting sales of fish such as sea bass. Waiters wear white jackets and black pants and the restaurant does not take reservations. On busy days, the Tadich can see between 600-800 patrons waiting in line to dine at the restaurant. On average, the restaurant serves 700 meals a day. See also * List of the oldest restaurants in the United States * List of seafood restaurants References Further reading *Briscoe, John.

It was first released in Europe on 4 September 2009 for Microsoft Windows, with ports for the Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 being released on 2 October 2010 and 5 November 2010 respectively. Venetica was later re-released for the North American market on 18 January 2011 and distributed by Rombax Games. The game takes place in a fictionalized version of 16th-century Europe in and around Venice in which Death is a human chosen by a mysterious group called the Corpus to fulfill the duties of the grim reaper. When a necromancer abuses the powers to gain immortality and control the world, the last Death's daughter, Scarlett, is tasked with stopping him and rescuing her father. Players take control of Scarlett from a third-person perspective, guiding her to urban and rural areas. Scarlett uses Death's scythe to fight as well as other melee weapons and magical spells called twilight powers. Quests grant experience points that can be used to upgrade weapons and skills. Venetica received mixed reviews from critics. The story and the ability to make choices that influence it were generally praised but graphics, audio, character design and technical problems were criticized.  Gameplay  Scarlett fighting with several enemies. In the upper left corner a medallion displays health (red), mental energy (blue) and twilight energy (purple). In the upper right is the mini-map. The bottom right features a bar with all currently accessible magic spells. Venetica is a single-player action role-playing game. Players control its protagonist Scarlett in a third-person 3D world from an over-the-shoulder view with a camera that can be zoomed in three fixed steps. The environment is partitioned in several maps with no true open world movement. Players on PC can use either keyboard and mouse or a gamepad to control Scarlett; on consoles only a gamepad can be used. The game uses a day and night cycle with each time of day lasting 15 minutes. Players cannot customize the protagonist herself but the game offers an experience point based leveling system that awards skill points and attribute points with each level gained. Skill points allow Scarlett to learn new fighting or magical powers by interacting with certain non-player characters. Attribute points can be used to increase one of four basic attributes that correspond to in-game characteristics, namely \\"constitution\\" (health points), \\"wisdom\\" (mental energy), \\"strength\\" (amount of damage dealt with weapons) and \\"mental power\\" (amount of damage dealt with spells). The protagonist can enter the spirit realm at certain places, allowing her to interact with characters who already died in the real world. Scarlett interacts with non-player characters through pre-scripted dialogue scenes that give players some freedom of choice with regards to her moral choices, allowing them to decide whether to be altruistic or egoistic. Upon reaching Venice for the first time, Scarlett has to choose between joining one of three different guilds, with that choice changing both how the story will unfold and what skills will be available to choose from. The game features a Reputation system that tracks her actions in Venice and reflects her renown in the city. Completing quests often grants Reputation while illegal acts such as breaking into houses or stealing will decrease it. A sufficiently high enough Reputation is required to interact with some characters. Fights play out by using a single attack button, combined with evasive or blocking maneuvers. However, players can chain multiple attacks to perform powerful combo attacks by timing attacks correctly. Additionally, players can use magical spells called mental skills by using mental energy, the game's equivalent to magic points. Mental energy is also used to power combat techniques called physical skills. Venetica features another type of energy called twilight energy. It is collected by fighting enemies using Death's scythe, called \\"Moonblade\\" in the game. Twilight energy also allows Scarlett to access the spirit world, called the Twilight World, which is required to solve some puzzles. Multiple enemies attack the player at the same time, forcing them to be constantly on the move to avoid being attacked from behind. Fights against the five main villains take place twice, once in the real world and afterwards again in the Twilight World where the villain has turned into a monster. With sufficient twilight energy, Scarlett will enter the Twilight World upon death allowing players to reposition her on the battlefield. If she does not have sufficient twilight energy, she will die and players are forced to reload their last manual save- game since Venetica features neither automatic saving nor respawn points. Even after replaying scenes, cutscenes and dialogue cannot be skipped. The game's head-up display features a medallion in the upper left corner that displays the current health in red, the current mental energy in blue and up to six segments inside that if filled in purple denote sufficient twilight energy to resurrect Scarlett upon death. In the middle is an orb that contains the player's level and which slowly fills up as they gain experience. In the upper right corner, a mini-map is displayed and in the bottom right corner, a spell bar allows quick access to currently equipped spells. In typical role-playing game fashion, Venetica offers players the choice of different weapons and armaments as well as potions and items to heal and help the protagonist. Players can find such items in the game world, by defeating enemies and as rewards for completing quests. The game features a main quest line based on the story as well as several optional quests that allow players to gain additional loot. Venetica offers between 25 and 40 hours of single-player gameplay.  Synopsis  Setting and characters The story of Venetica takes place in a 16th-century styled world in and around Venice where Death is a physical being, who follows the instructions of a group known as Corpus. Every generation, Corpus must select the successor for Death. The game takes place after the council chooses a necromancer to control Death and he decides to bring complete death and destruction upon the world. This necromancer has immortalized himself through Death; thus, the current Death and Corpus cannot stop him. The player takes control of Scarlett, Death's daughter, who must cultivate and grow her powers to save her father and the world from the necromancer.  Plot  Scarlett is living in the small fictional village of San Pasquale near Venice with her lover, Benedict. The game begins with the village being attacked by assassins and Benedict dying in order to protect Scarlett. On the night after the attack, Death appears in her dreams and reveals that she, who thought herself an orphan, is actually his daughter, conceived shortly before he became Death, granting Scarlett many of Death's powers. He tells her that Victor, the Undead Archon, used a loophole in the rules that bind existence to cheat death and become nearly immortal. Initially chosen to be Death's successor by the Corpus, he instead focused on the forbidden art of necromancy and was cast out. Denied what he considers his birth right to become Death, he swore vengeance on the world. For his plans, he recruited four allies to rule the mortal world as the Undead Five: The Mistress of the Assassin's Guild, Hector of Persia, Princess Chiamaka of Africa and the Doge of Venice. Death informs Scarlett that Victor is seeking the Black Grimoire, a powerful book of spells that would allow him to consolidate his power forever. Tasked by Death to do so, Scarlett travels to Venice to track down the necromancer Sophistos, the last guardian of the Black Grimoire, to learn whether he destroyed the book as instructed. On her way into the city, Scarlett is accosted by the Mistress of Assassins which she defeats in a duel. She then tracks down Sophistos to Hector's flagship which anchors near Venice. Upon reaching him, Sophistos is killed but Scarlett defeats Hector and sinks his ship. She goes to Sophistos' house in Venice and uses her powers to converse with his spirit there. He tells her that he constructed a furnace hot enough to burn the book but instead opted to hide it, forcing Scarlett to retrieve it. After finding it and battling Sophistos' ghost who objects to the book's destruction, Scarlett manages to destroy the book. Scarlett will then move into the Inner City after deciding which of three guilds to join: The Order of the Holy Seal, a warrior order fueled by revenge that Benedict wanted to join before his death, The Hooded Wings, a guild of discreet messengers, or the Net of the Mask, the necromancer guild Victor was a member of. Depending on which guild is chosen, different tasks have to be fulfilled. Princess Chiamaka places a curse on Scarlett which will eventually kill her if not removed by the Princess herself. Scarlett travels to Africa to confront Chiamaka and after defeating her, the curse is lifted and also gives her an essence needed to reach Victor who has sealed himself in the Doge's Palace. She enters the Palace to find that Victor has magically forced the Doge to reconstruct the Black Grimoire from the Twilight World where it ended up after its prior destruction. Scarlett fights both men and manages to kill the Doge but not before he finished transcribing the book. Scarlett and Victor fight for it and Victor merges with the spirit of the Doge in the Twilight World. After defeating the merged being, Scarlett fights and defeats Victor in his mortal form. After his defeat, Death will appear and offer Scarlett to kill Victor herself or to let Death take him. The game ends with one of two cut scenes, depending on whether Scarlett behaved nobly or villainous. Development Venetica was developed by Deck13, a small German developer with less than 40 employees which had previously mainly developed point-and-click adventure games, such as Ankh and Jack Keane. The game was first announced by publisher DTP Entertainment on 27 May 2008 with the release of story information and four screenshots. More features, such as the day and night cycle, were shown to the press in October 2008. In March 2009, the developer collaborated with German games magazine PC Games to give players the chance to name a weapon in the game complete with back story. On 21 April 2009, the winner was revealed to be \\"Chantori\\". On 26 August 2009, publisher DTP Entertainment announced that the Windows version of Venetica had gone gold. Venetica was first released for the European market on 4 September 2009 for Microsoft Windows. In December 2009, Deck13 released a patch that significantly improved the game's graphics and level of detail as well as its performance and added a number of new features. The game was later ported to the Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. The Xbox 360 version was developed by Wizarbox and released on 18 December 2009. The PlayStation 3 version was released on 3 December 2010. All versions of Venetica were released in North America on 18 January 2011 where they were distributed by Rombax Games. Despite internal wishes, Deck13 has ruled out a sequel in December 2017. Reception The game got \\"mixed or average reviews\\" for Windows, and \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 according to ranking aggregator Metacritic. The graphical design of the game was generally found lacking and dated by reviewers. RPGamer called the setting \\"stunning\\" but limited their praise to the scenery, adding that up-close areas and characters look incorrect and that the game is marred with inconsistencies. GamesRadar called the experience of playing the game \\"dizzying\\", citing sharp light contrasts, erratic camera and too small subtitles, and opined that the graphics would have been considered terrible even on previous generation consoles like the PlayStation 2 or the GameCube. In his review for Bit-Tech, Chris Pickering agreed with these criticisms but pointed out that at times, such as the shimmering effect of certain weapons, the graphics are actually quite good. The graphics on the console versions were generally considered worse than for the PC version despite the game not using the full potential of the consoles. There was near unanimous consensus among reviewers that the game suffered from many graphical bugs, with critics citing examples such as limbs appearing in door and walls, swords hovering in the air, items appearing through other items, and disappearing shadows. IGN opined that these, combined with stiff animations and poor lip-syncing, made the game unintentionally funny. The soundtrack was rated passable but unimpressive and reviewers noted a distinct lack of music. Venetica received worse reviews for its English versions with many reviewers particularly criticizing the poor writing, voice acting and recording as well as non- matching subtitles that suffer from poor spelling. The fight system received mixed reactions. Some critics lauded the combo system and the useful spells that allow the player to handle larger groups of enemies without the game becoming too easy for it as well as adding some needed variety. Others were less enthusiastic, calling the fight system shallow and repetitive \\"button- mashing\\"-only and especially criticized that because of the poor camera movement or getting stuck in the environment, players suffer unpreventable deaths. Writing for PC World, Matt Peckham opined that the game forces players to simply keep hitting buttons as enemies can withstand even strong attacks with ease, comparing fights to \\"chiseling stone that can chisel back\\" and speculating that the developers increased the enemies' strength in an attempt to draw out engagements. Reviewers also bemoaned the lack of an autosave feature, forcing players who did not manually save to replay large parts of the game with no way to skip ahead. The controls on Windows were criticized by some, with Bit-Tech opining that players using keyboard and mouse were at a disadvantage. German magazine GameStar praised the quest design, emphasizing that quest givers are believable within the story and that the quests are varied, although it noted that feedback for solving quests diminishes in the later stages of the game. IGN liked the aspect of the Twilight World and how players are forced to switch worlds to solve some quests and defeat some enemies. Critics also liked the morality system and that players can choose different approaches and make choices on how to proceed, although the lack of long-term impact was noted. Others found the quests less interesting, opining that they boil down to simple kill or retrieve quests. The writing and character design was criticized by some critics as mediocre. Writing for Destructoid, Hollie Bennett opined that the characters felt so two-dimensional and underdeveloped that she felt relief when some traveling companions died and no longer had to be interacted with. She went on to say that she liked the basic idea and emphasized that Venetica was an accomplishment for such a small development team but criticized that the developer's over-ambition led to so many problems that the game became frustrating to play. On the other hand, IGN emphasized that the story was interesting and liked the branching storylines and morality choices the game offers.

In the latter case, a statement is distinct from a sentence in that a sentence is only one formulation of a statement, whereas there may be many other formulations expressing the same statement. Overview Philosopher of language, Peter Strawson advocated the use of the term \\"statement\\" in sense (b) in preference to proposition. Strawson used the term \\"Statement\\" to make the point that two declarative sentences can make the same statement if they say the same thing in different ways. Thus in the usage advocated by Strawson, \\"All men are mortal.\\" and \\"Every man is mortal.\\" are two different sentences that make the same statement. In either case a statement is viewed as a truth bearer. Examples of sentences that are (or make) statements: *\\"Socrates is a man.\\" *\\"A triangle has three sides.\\" *\\"Madrid is the capital of Spain.\\" Examples of sentences that are not (or do not make) statements: *\\"Who are you?\\" *\\"Run!\\" *\\"Greenness perambulates.\\" *\\"I had one grunch but the eggplant over there.\\" *\\"The King of France is wise.\\" *\\"Broccoli tastes good.\\" *\\"Pegasus exists.\\" The first two examples are not declarative sentences and therefore are not (or do not make) statements. The third and fourth are declarative sentences but, lacking meaning, are neither true nor false and therefore are not (or do not make) statements. The fifth and sixth examples are meaningful declarative sentences, but are not statements but rather matters of opinion or taste. Whether or not the sentence \\"Pegasus exists.\\" is a statement is a subject of debate among philosophers. Bertrand Russell held that it is a (false) statement. Strawson held it is not a statement at all.  As an abstract entity  In some treatments \\"statement\\" is introduced in order to distinguish a sentence from its informational content. A statement is regarded as the information content of an information-bearing sentence. Thus, a sentence is related to the statement it bears like a numeral to the number it refers to. Statements are abstract logical entities, while sentences are grammatical entities.

In 1967, it acquired three DC-7 and commenced operations, followed in 1969 by a BAC 1-11 but in early 1970, as a result of financial losses, flights were temporarily suspended.

Operations were concentrated on charter and inclusive tour flights, mainly from Germany (D√ºsseldorf). In 1975, an SE 210 Caravelle was acquired followed by a second Caravelle in 1976. In 1975, Air Spain ceased operations and TAE leased one further Douglas DC-8-20 to fill in the vacuum in the charter market. The year 1980 brought an economic recession to Spain and most of Western Europe and the fortunes of TAE began to decline. Another factor that influenced the decline of TAE was increased competition from other charter operators. That, combined with the fact that TAE was operating old DC-8 and Caravelle aircraft, led to financial difficulties.

Hurricane Charley lasted from August 9 to August 15, 2004, and at peak intensity it attained 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) winds, making it a strong Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm made landfall in southwestern Florida at maximum strength, and moved northward, parallel to the U.S. East Coast before moving ashore on northeastern South Carolina. The storm caused flooding in seven counties within the state as a result of of rainfall. Winds peaked at which downed trees and power lines, and left 65,000 homes without power. A storm surge of to was reported, along with moderate waves that caused minor beach erosion. No deaths are attributed to the storm.  Preparations  Hurricane Charley 5-day forecast map on August 13, 2004 On August 13, 2004, a tropical storm watch was issued for Cape Fear, southward to South Carolina. The watch was extended northward to Oregon Inlet later that day; the watch further extended to Chincoteague, Virginia. The tropical storm watch from Cape Lookout to Oregon Inlet was changed to a hurricane warning. A hurricane watch was subsequently put into effect for coastal areas from Oregon Inlet to the North Carolina/Virginia border, although by August 15 all advisories were discontinued. Flood watches were also placed into effect for portions of the state. Governor Mike Easley declared a state of emergency in advance of the storm, and 200 National Guard troops were dispatched to Charlotte, Raleigh, Kinston and Lumerton, while 800 more were on standby. On Ocracoke Island, authorities ordered mandatory evacuations, while on Bogue Banks voluntary evacuations were in place. Officials in Wrightsville Beach drove along the streets with loudspeakers mounted on trucks, warning tourists that a storm was approaching. The storm forced the University of North Carolina at Wilmington to suspend a planned opening for students moving into residence halls. Campgrounds at the Cape Hatteras National Seashore were closed by the National Park Service and three boat ramps were closed. Duke Power Co. prepared for Charley by lowering the level of hydroelectric lakes to make room for excessive rainfall. The state Department of Environment and Natural Resources advised hog farmers to pump out their waste lagoon. About 60 Red Cross shelters were opened during the storm and during the peak of Charley, and roughly 1,600 people sought protection.  Impact  Hurricane Charley produced moderate to heavy rainfall over the state, peaking at near Greenville; other rainfall amounts ranged from less than ‚Äìmore than . The outer rainbands began affecting the region in the early hours of August 14. Due to widespread debris, storm drains became clogged which left flooding in some areas. Freshwater flooding was reported in seven counties along the coastal plain. State highways 42 and 581, as well as numerous county and local roads, were covered with at least of water. Wilmington and surrounding towns were forced to close a total of 20 streets. The heavy precipitation also caused the Neuse River to swell to flood stage. A few businesses throughout the region were damaged; two in downtown Greenville and five others were flooded. The storm produced estimated storm surge of to , along with waves of up to in height. However, there were isolated reports of surge, particularly along the beaches of Brunswick County. This produced minor beach erosion along the coastline. Winds gusted from 60‚Äì70 miles per hour (95‚Äì110 km/h), causing minor wind damage. The hurricane spawned five weak tornadoes across the state, including an F1 in Nags Head that damaged twenty structures. Charley destroyed 40 houses and damaged 2,231, 231 severely, including 221 damaged beach homes in Sunset Beach. Damage was the greatest in Brunswick County, where wind gusts peaked at 85 miles per hour (137 km/h). The winds blew down chimneys and damaged a roof on one building, and ripped the siding off another. Crop damage was also heavy in Brunswick County, with 50% of the tobacco crop lost and 30% of the corn and vegetable fields destroyed. Strong winds downed trees and power lines, leaving 65,000 homes without power. Damage in North Carolina totaled to $25 million (2004 USD).

Duncan played for Hibernian from 1969 until 1984. Originally under manager Willie Macfarlane, he then featured in the teams of the 1970s managed by Eddie Turnbull, which were known as Turnbull's Tornadoes. This team won the Scottish League Cup in 1972 and finished second in the league in 1974 and 1975, which was Hibs' greatest period of sustained success since the Famous Five team of the early 1950s. A highlight of Duncan's time at Hibs was when he scored twice in the club's 7‚Äì0 victory at the home of Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts on 1 January 1973.Mon 01 Jan 1973 Division 1 Hearts 0 Hibernian 7 www.londonhearts.com Towards the end of this period, Duncan won international recognition, making his Scotland debut against Portugal on 13 May 1975. Duncan featured in the three Home Internationals that season, including the infamous 5‚Äì1 defeat by England at Wembley. Duncan won the last of his six caps later that year against Denmark. Coincidentally, this was the game that was marred by an incident afterwards where five players (Billy Bremner, Willie Young, Joe Harper, Pat McCluskey and Arthur Graham) were allegedly ejected from a nightclub in Copenhagen. Those players were banned from playing for Scotland, initially for life, but the bans were eventually commuted. Duncan continued to play for Hibs as the club's fortunes declined in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The club did reach the 1979 Scottish Cup Final, but Duncan's own goal during extra time in the second replay proved to be the winning goal for Rangers.

It was first released in Japan in November 2008 and was later released in North America in September 2010 and in Europe and Australia in October 2010. In the game, Layton meets an older version of his apprentice, Luke, who brings him to a terrible future he wishes him to help fix. The game was well received by critics. An enhanced mobile port of Unwound Future, subtitled \\"HD for Mobile\\", was released on July 13, 2020. Gameplay An early puzzle in Professor Layton and the Unwound Future. The puzzle is solved via input on the bottom screen, while instructions are given on the top.As with previous Professor Layton games, Unwound Future is an adventure game where the player solves puzzles offered by local citizens to progress the story forward, through dialogue and around 32 minutes of full motion video. The player moves about the game through still images of locations. The player can use the DS touchscreen to tap on non- player characters to start a dialog or to obtain a puzzle, and also can search anywhere on the background for hint coins, with some areas needing to be tapped several times to reveal a secret hint coin or puzzle. Puzzles are brainteasers of many varieties, including visual, math, and logic. There is no time limit to solve puzzles, and the player can get up to 3 hints at a cost of one hint coin each; a new feature in Unwound Future is a \\"super hint\\", costing 2 coins, that can only be bought after the other 3 hints have been revealed, but that nearly reveals the puzzle's solution. If the player is correct in solving the puzzle, they gain a number of \\"Picarats\\", a form of currency within the game. Guessing the incorrect answer will reduce the number of picarats the player can get on subsequent attempts. Players can visit certain areas in order to play undiscovered or unsolved puzzles that are left behind as the story progresses. As part of rewards for solving puzzles, the player may play one of three mini-games that support additional puzzles in Layton's Trunk that can be attempted at any time. One mini-game is based on sticker books, placing the correct stickers at locations in the book to make the story make sense. Another requires training a parrot to carry items to a character using a series of ropes to act as perches or rebounding walls. The third mini- game is a toy car that the player must drive across specific tiles on a map using a series of directional indicators. Layton's Bag also contains details on the story, characters, and a list of completed puzzles the player can review and try again. After completing the game, several other puzzle challenges become available in the game's bonus features, many more difficult than the main game puzzles. When the player has completed all the puzzles within the game, a final puzzle is revealed. Players may also access a number of bonus features depending on how many picarats that have accumulated throughout the game. As with the previous two titles in the series, additional weekly puzzles were available for download via the Bonus menu, with one being released each week from the original release date, for 30 weeks. After May 20, 2014, it's no longer possible to download the additional content, as the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service was terminated on that date. Plot As Layton and Luke are invited to witness a demonstration of a time machine built by Dr. Alain Stahngun, the experiment goes awry, causing the disappearance of Stahngun and the prime minister, Bill Hawks. A week later, as numerous scientists have been reported missing, Layton and Luke receive a letter purporting to be from Luke ten years in the future, leading the two to a quaint clock shop in the London back alleys. Inside, the old couple show the two another time machine in the guise of a giant clock, and they find themselves in a drastically-changed quasi-steam punk London ten years from their present, where they meet the Future Luke. He explains that in this future, Layton has become the head of a mafia-like mob known as the Family and taken control of London, and decides to assist him. After briefly returning to the past to look up some files pertaining to an accident which claimed the life of his girlfriend, Claire, ten years ago, Layton and Luke return to the future London, inadvertently bringing Flora, Inspector Chelmey and his assistant Barton with him. As the group investigates the whereabouts of Future Layton, Luke is reminded that he will soon be moving with his parents. Arriving at the tower, the group learn that the Future Layton is Dr. Stahngun, whose true identity is Dimitri Allen. He reveals to have taken Bill hostage, revealing that they, along with Claire (whom he also had feelings for), were working on a time machine ten years ago, but Bill's desire for money made him sell a crucial part, which led to the accident that claimed Claire's life. This led to Dimitri's dedication to build a working time machine and return to the past so he can save Claire's life. He attempts to trap Layton, but this is foiled by the fact that Layton had gained the assistance of Don Paolo, a recurring villain throughout the Layton series, who is a villain-turned-hero in this game, who also had feelings for Claire. Together they infiltrate Dimitri's base of operations to free the other scientists, where Layton encounters Claire's near-identical sister, Celeste, who assists them. As everyone gathers at the Thames Arms restaurant, where Dimitri is also waiting for them disguised as the bartender, Layton manages to deduce that they are not actually in the future, but in a pseudo-replica of London built in a cavern. The purpose of this replica was to fool the scientists into thinking they were stranded 10 years from home, motivating them to build a time machine in order to return home. Dimitri built this replica London when he realized that he alone could not construct a working time machine and needed scientists that were just as motivated as him. Layton also deduces that Dimitri is but a pawn compared to the true mastermind, who is revealed to be the Future Luke, whose true identity is Clive, a boy who sought revenge against Dimitri and Bill and London in general as the explosion that killed Claire also took his parents away from him. Kidnapping Flora, Clive escapes to his moving fortress, the machine the scientists had really been working on without Dimitri's knowledge, which he brings to the surface to attack London. With help from Don Paolo, Layton and Luke manage to board the fortress and free Flora, later joined by Celeste. After deducing that they need to reverse the flow of power from the generator, they discover Bill is attached to the generator, wired to a bomb. With thanks to Celeste's old watch, they manage to reroute the bomb, free Bill and reverse the power flow of the fortress, causing it to collapse. After using Don Paolo's modified Laytonmobile to get everyone to the ground, where Chelmey manages to evacuate the underground citizens, Layton returns to help Celeste rescue Clive from the fortress before it falls down into the fake future London and explodes. As everyone safely regroups, Clive is put under arrest but promises to atone for his crimes, thanking Layton for comforting him as he did the day his parents were killed. It is then revealed that Celeste is actually Claire herself, who was teleported ten years into the future during the accident. However, her presence had become unstable and would soon send her back in time to the moment of her death, leading Dimitri to try to find a way to save her but to no avail. Accepting her fate, Claire has a tearful final reunion with Layton before bidding farewell disappearing back to her time, to the moment of her death. Layton, although crushed to lose Claire again, finally comes to terms with his loss and removes his hat out of respect to her. After the incident, Layton bids farewell to Luke as he boards a ship to his new home. Some time later, Layton receives a letter from Luke, inviting him to investigate another puzzling situation with him. Release The game was released in Japan on November 27, 2008, and was the 15th best- selling game in 2008. A western localization of the game was revealed at E3 2010, with a September 20, 2010 release date for North America, and an October 22, 2010 release date for Europe. An English trailer was also shown. The North American release date was later pushed to September 12, 2010. Music Like the previous two games, the game's music was composed by Tomohito Nishiura and later released in Japan, on an album titled Layton Kyoju to Saigo no Jikan Ryoko Original Soundtrack. Unwound Future's ending theme, \\"Time Travel'\\" was sung by Ann Sally in the original Japanese versions, while the international versions replaced it with an instrumental version. The soundtrack album replaces the vocal theme with a separate piano version, not included in either release of the game. Square Enix Music Online gave the album a score of eight out of ten and called it the \\"best and most entertaining album in the trilogy, but criticized its \\"lack of memorability and entertainment outside of the game.\\" RPGFan Music responded favorably, stating, \\"It all held my interest, from start to finish, through multiple listens.\\" Reception Professor Layton and the Unwound Future received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Video game talk show Good Game: Spawn Point's two presenters praised the memo overlay feature and said, \\"If you're a Layton fan, then you're going to get exactly what you expect ‚Äî which is some very polished and brilliant puzzle action.\\" Nintendo Power's review said, \\"I have no qualms calling this the best Professor Layton game yet\\", and, in the 2010 Nintendo Power awards, the game was recognized as both the best puzzle game and the game with the strongest ending released in 2010. In Japan, Famitsu gave the game a score of one nine and three eights for a total of 33 out of 40. The Escapist gave the game all five stars and called it \\"a brain- twisting delight. Show up for the clever puzzles, stick around for the gorgeous visuals and quirky minigames.\\" The Guardian similarly gave it all five stars and said it was \\"perfectly designed for DS and something the whole family can get sucked into.\\" The A.V. Club gave it an A‚àí and said that it \\"doesn't require knowledge of the previous games, but still builds the trilogy to an appropriately grand conclusion.\\" The Daily Telegraph gave it a score of nine out of ten and called it \\"an absolute delight.\\" As of December 2010, Unwound Future sold 862,967 copies in Japan, and more than 1.87 million copies in North America and Europe. As of March 2011, its sales in North America and Europe totalled 1.97 million copies sold.

It is held in a central area such as a park and has many activities for fire department members and sometimes other community members. A muster typically revolves around a firematic competition between fire companies from around the surrounding area. Other attractions include a flea market, live music, food, demonstrations, apparatus judging, vehicle shows and contests.Indian Well State Park Competition Events These events differ in the format of each muster but most follow a basic structure. Hose Lay The hose lay consists of a race against the clock to see which team can connect hoses the fastest. Competitors start at a starting line, and on the signal, run to couple lengths of hose in various configurations. Hose Roll In hose roll, competitors race each other to roll up a length of hose unfurled in a straight line in front of them from one end to the other. Midnight Alarm Midnight alarm is supposed to simulate a fire call in the middle of the night. Competitors either start out \\"sleeping\\" by lying down on the starting line or simply standing on it, depending on local rules. At the starting signal, competitors must run a distance of about 25 ft to the dressing area where they must don firefighter's gear. After they are all dressed, they then must complete a task together in their gear such as a hose lay (see above) or simply run to a finish line, or the \\"firetruck\\". Fastest time wins. Ladder Climb In ladder climb, competitors race each other for the fastest time to reach the top of a ladder. Bucket Brigade In the bucket brigade race, competitors must work together in a bucket brigade to transfer a set amount of water, such as 25 gallons, from one container to another spilling as little as possible. Another variant of this uses a small house roughly 48 inches by 48 inches and roughly 6 feet tall, the water must be drawn by buckets from a small pool. These buckets are then passed from member to member roughly 10 feet to a \\"thrower\\" the thrower then throws the water on the pitched roof of the building. The water runs off the roof into a rain gutter which drains into a barrel which is about 25-30 gallons in capacity, this water then runs into a small tube which fills a 1-gallon jug. The timer ends when the jug is filled. Tug of War This is a game where Competitors (most often equal on both sides) must pull their opposing team across a line, into a puddle, etc. A team is meant to resist their competitor's effort to pull them across the line. sample pic. Water Barrel Competitors must move a barrel across the opposing team's line using water pressure from a fire hose. Obstacle Course An obstacle course can consist of any combination of the events above or other tasks. Page Title Response Contest There are several variations of this one but the premise is the same in all. The Crew (4-6 team members) simulates receiving an alarm, responding to and handling the alarm. The firefighters start out in street clothes and dress in full turnout gear (Helmet, Coat, and boots) board their fire engine and respond approximately 200 feet up the course to a portable water tank, the engine crew simultaneously stretches 100‚Äì150 feet of 2 1/2 inch hose toward a target area as other crew members place hard suction hose to the intake on the engine and another member connects the 2 1/2\\" line to the discharge. The pump operator must then draft water from the portable tank and discharge it through the 2 1/2 inch hose to knock down a target (usually a beer keg or traffic cone with a ball on top) This contest checks crew integrity, skill of the equipment operator, skill of the nozzle crew, and operation of the equipment. When done by a well versed team it can be done in under a minute as was accomplished many times in the late 1980s and early 1990s at Greenfield Village SPAAMFAA musters in Michigan. Some variations include stadium response where apparatus does not drive, another variation is the crew is lying on cots on an elevated platform and must slide down a pole. One variation exempts the equipment operator from wearing gear however it must be on the truck. First Water  The pumps on fire trucks don‚Äôt help if there‚Äôs not a skilled person operating the controls. This race pits teams against the clock to see who can get a steady stream of water to the deluge gun (on the end of the hose) the quickest. The operator starts 10 feet from the pumper without the pump in gear, the operator must engage the pump, and pull a draft and have a working stream quickly. The fastest time for this event wins, judging is usually broken up in classes for centrifugal, piston, and rotary gear pumps. Another variant is Bracket pumping where the operator guesses how long it will take him to perform the same tasks, his score is the difference in seconds from his guess to his actual.  Waterball  Two teams of firefighters face off on a course 110 feet in length and the object is to push a 15\\" ball suspended from a cable to the opposing team's goal. This is played using 1 1/2 inch hose and each team has a lead hose team and a goaltender hoseline. full rules can be seen on the following site. http://www.fire.cds.com/waterball.htm References External links *Burnsville, MN Fire Muster *New England Muster Association *CALIFORNIA FIREMEN'S MUSTER ASSOCIATION *Great Lakes Spaamfaa *New Marlborough(MA)Muster Team Category:Firefighting in the United States Category:Firefighting competitions ","title":"Muster (event)"},{"id":"17642820","text":"Saccorhiza polyschides, common name furbellow, is a large brown algae of the lower shore and is the largest seaweed found in Europe.Furbellows (Saccorhiza polyschides) The Sea Shore, accessed 21 September 2011.

There are 11,000 Junior Civitan members in 400 clubs in North America, Africa, Asia, and Europe. It is the longest lasting project of its parent organization Civitan International. History The first Junior Civitan club was formed in 1927 by a school teacher in Maine. Unaware of the existence of Civitan International, she created a group for her students that promoted good citizenship and called it Civitan. When members of Civitan International discovered that their organization's name was being used by another group, they reached an agreement which allowed the school club to call itself Junior Civitan. Also, Civitan International agreed to informally promote the creation of clubs for students around the country. Several more Junior Civitan clubs formed across the country. In 1932, Civitan began to issue official charters to the Junior Civitan clubs. It was not until 1939 that Civitan International passed an official resolution to adopt the Junior Civitan program. Service Projects On a local level, individual Junior Civitan clubs undertake various service projects which benefit their local communities. Examples of club events include raising money to prevent the use of child soldiers in Uganda and hosting events for people with intellectual disabilities. Clubs operate independently of the international organization or other clubs, leaving them free to participate in whatever service they deem appropriate. While individual clubs are free to pursue their own projects, on an international level Junior Civitan is focused on service to the developmentally disabled. This emphasis was adopted in 1956. Many of Junior Civitans projects benefit the UAB Civitan International Research Center, the first institution of its kind to be focused solely on the research of developmental disabilities. International Events Sno-Do Sno-Do is one of Junior Civitan's most important fundraisers; it is held annually in Barrie, Ontario. The Governors of each district raise money to participate in a snowmobile ride through the Canadian countryside and participate in the Governors update led by the International Board. The event has raised more than $1.5 million for the research of developmental disabilities since its inception. Dance-a-Thon Dance-A-Thon is Junior Civitan's second most important fundraising event. Formerly held in Canada, the event was moved to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The event lasts for 12 hours, with participants following a specially devised menu to provide maximum energy. The Dance-A-Thon started in Oakville, Ontario, and for many years lasted 25 hours, usually ending with the song \\"Taking Care of Business.\\" This fundraiser has generated over $1 million for the research of developmental disabilities at the UAB Civitan International Research Center. International Convention Junior Civitan holds an international convention once each year. Junior Civitans who attend the convention participate in international officer elections, business sessions, workshops, dances, and social activities. This event gives every member a chance to meet other people within the organization and begin planning activities for their clubs.

Rosen (June 26, 1939 ‚Äì August 4, 2019) was an American voice director and voice actor. History Shortly after graduating from California State College, Long Beach, Rosen got work as a production assistant at KCET. He wrote and starred in the TV series Dusty's Treehouse from 1968 to 1980. Rosen voice directed many cartoons and commercials for television, including MASK, Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling, Fraggle Rock, the first episodes of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series), The Legend of Prince Valiant, Super Secret Secret Squirrel segments of 2 Stupid Dogs, Biker Mice from Mars and many more. Other such shows soon followed: Batman: The Animated Series, The Pirates of Dark Water, X-Men, Spiderman: The Animated Series and Superman: The Animated Series directed by Andrea Romano, Gordon Hunt, Dan Hennessey and Tony Pastor, and Phantom 2040 also directed by Rosen. Rosen had also had live- action roles in Rome and The Huntress. Death Rosen died on August 4, 2019, at the age of 80, from cancer. Dusty's Treehouse Dusty's Treehouse is a children's television program which starred Stuart Rosen and featured the puppets of Tony Urbano; the show premiered in fall 1975. Rosen was the creator and co-executive producer and based it on a program titled Dusty's Attic which he developed and aired from 1966‚Äì67 on KCET, then an NET station in Los Angeles. The show won eight Emmy Awards. Dusty's Treehouse originated from KNXT (now KCBS-TV), the local CBS flagship TV station in Los Angeles. It ran from 1970‚Äì1980 and was briefly syndicated nationally (including on the rest of the CBS O&O; stations), and then appeared in reruns during the inaugural launching of the Nickelodeon children's cable TV network, for four additional seasons. Carrying on in a traditional style similar to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood and Captain Kangaroo, the show featured Dusty (Rosen) and his amazing custom-built treehouse where anything and everything could happen. Often Dusty had conversations with his puppet-animal friends including Maxine the crow, Scooter the squirrel, and Stanley the red-haired spider in sneakers. Dusty also went on \\"tree trips\\" (field trips via balloon & basket) to factories to see how products were made, or to parks, zoos, aquariums, and so on. Other puppets and shadow puppets enacted classic fairy tales, too, including Cinderella, Beauty & the Beast, Puss in Boots, and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Topics included school performance, politics, music, behavior vs. misbehavior, kindness to others, good health habits, asking for help, and even \\"being careful what you wish for,\\" in an episode where Maxine magically becomes an ear of corn, Scooter becomes a walnut, Stanley becomes an apple, and Dusty disappears. Jokes, songs, and comic antics ensued but always with a moral lesson to be learned. Sometimes a serious topic was tackled, ranging from Stanley coping with the death of his pet goldfish, to Scooter being hit by a car for chasing a baseball out into traffic during game practice. One episode involved Dusty himself learning a life lesson about how eating heavy food before bedtime (Maxine warns) causes nightmares; Dusty goes on a blacklight theatre journey through Nightmare Land and is chased by the menacing Mister Stomach Ache. But a new friend is made in the form of Sonja the gypsy fortune teller, a character who would reappear frequently in the show not by way of Nightmare Land. In later seasons, the treehouse got a makeover, and new supporting characters were introduced like Sunny & Stormy, two female puppets with opposing positive/negative viewpoints, and the mysterious Meef, a hairy, comical stranger with a pack-rat habit of swiping unguarded objects.

He spent most of his life preaching to Indigenous communities in the western Amazon region, including the Omaguas, the Yurimaguas, the Aisuare, the Ibanomas, and the Ticunas. In 1707 he produced the first accurate map of the Amazon River, establishing as its source the Mara√±√≥n. Adept in technical arts and handicrafts, he also was a physician, a painter, a carpenter, a joiner and a linguist skilled at interacting with the Indians.Johann Christoph Adelung, Mithridates oder allgemeine Sprachenkunde: mit dem Vater Unser als Sprachprobe in beynahe f√ºnfhundert Sprachen und Mundarten., (Berlin, 1806), III, ii, 611. \\"The linguistic abilities of Samuel Fritz.\\" He was effective and respected, and helpful to the Viceroyalty of Peru in its boundary dispute with the State of Brazil. Between 1686 and 1715, he founded thirty-eight missions along the length of the Amazon River, in the country between the Rio Napo and Rio Negro, that were called the Omagua Missions. The most important of these were Nuestra Se√±ora de las Nieves de Yurimaguas, and San Joaqu√≠n de Omaguas, which was founded in the first years of Fritz's missionary activities and then moved in January 1695 to the mouth of the Ampiyacu river, near the modern-day town of Pebas in the Peruvian Department of Loreto. These missions were continually attacked by the Brazilian Bandeirantes beginning in the 1690s.Michael, Lev . 2014. \\"On the Pre-Columbian Origin of Proto-Omagua-Kokama.\\" Journal of Language Contact 7(2):309{344. Fritz detailed his early missionary activity among the Omagua people in a set of personal diaries written between 1689 and 1723. Lengthy passages from these diaries were compiled and interspersed with commentary by an anonymous author in the time between Fritz's death and 1738, when they appear in the collection of Pablo Maroni.Maroni, Pablo. (1738) 1988. Noticias aut√©nticas del famoso r√≠o Mara√±√≥n. Jean Pierre Chaumeil, ed. (1738; Iquitos: Instituto de Investigaci√≥n de la Amazon√≠a Peruana‚ÄìCentro de Estudios Teol√≥gicos de la Amazon√≠a, 1988). Early life Fritz was born at Trautenau, Bohemia. After studying for a year at the Charles University in Prague, he entered the Society of Jesus as a novice in 1673, and studied mathematics, geodesy and surveying. He taught for several years at the Jesuit seminaries in Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ and B≈ôeznice, eventually becoming deputy rector at Brno where he also conducted the student orchestra. He was ordained as a priest on 4 February 1683.Jan Filipsk√Ω, \\"FRITZ Samuel ‚Äì Czech-German missionary in South America,\\" in Who Was Who Czech and Slovak Orientalists, Libri Prague, 1999. In September 1684 he was sent to Quito as a missionary, arriving in Cartagena, Colombia and journeying overland. In 1686 he was assigned to work among the Indians of the Upper Mara√±on. Work with the Omagua people Fritz established himself among the Omaguas (Omayas or Cambebas) and within a few years had developed his own Omagua catechism in the Omagua language. The Omagua people had requested protection from Portuguese slavers who had begun raiding their communities by the 1680s. When Fritz arrived in their territory in 1686, the Omagua inhabited the islands in the middle of the Amazon River, in a region stretching approximately from the confluence of the Amazon and Napo River to the Juru√° River.John Hemming, Red Gold: The Conquest of the Brazilian Indians, 1500-1760, Harvard University Press, 1978. Towards the end of his first year among the Omaguas, he began a lengthy journey downriver to visit all thirty-eight existing villages, spending two months at each one. He renamed them using the names of patron saints, constructed several rudimentary chapels and baptized mainly children because he found most adults to be insufficiently indoctrinated, as well as \\"reluctant to give up entirely certain heathen abuses.\\" At the conclusion of this journey, which lasted about three years, he conducted a baptismal ceremony over the entire tribe before returning to San Joaqu√≠n de Omaguas.David Graham Sweet, \\"Samuel Fritz, S.

He later concentrated indigenous peoples from different communities into so-called \\"Jesuit reductions.\\" He also preached intermittently to the Yurimagua, the Aisuare, the Ibanoma and the Ticunas.Works Issued by the Hakluyt Society, Issue 24, 1859; University of Minnesota.

In 1689 he undertook, in a primitive pirogue, a daring journey of over 6,000 kilometers down the Amazon to Par√°, where he went for medical treatment, probably for malaria. \\"I fell sick of the most violent attacks of fever and dropsy that began in my feet, and other complaints,\\" he later wrote in an account of his journey. Fritz set off downstream \\"in the hope of getting some remedy for my sufferings,\\" reaching the mouth of the Rio Negro after three weeks.Andr√© Ferrand de Almeida, \\"Samuel Fritz and the Mapping of the Amazon,\\" Imago Mundi. Vol. 55, (2003), pp. 113-119.There he met a group of Tupinambarana warriors who escorted him to the Mercedarian mission, where he was treated with bloodletting and therapeutic fumigation, \\"but instead of being benefitted, I was made worse than before.\\" Fritz was taken by some Portuguese missionaries to the Jesuit College in the city of Par√°, but when he felt well enough to return to his mission, he was detained and imprisoned for eighteen months by Artur de S√° Meneses, the Governor of the State of Maranh√£o, on the accusation of being a Spanish spy.Catholic Encyclopedia (1913): Samuel Fritz In fact, the Portuguese were concerned that Spanish missions on the Upper Solim√µes River would lead indigenous communities to support Spain against Portugal. Fritz made use of this time to prepare a map of the river. In 1691, after a complaint was made before the Council of the Indies, his release was authorized by the King of Portugal, who also reprimanded and dismissed the governor. Fritz was accompanied for part of his return journey by a contingent of Portuguese soldiers, with whom he visited fortresses at Gurup√° and Tapaj√≥s. After leaving Fritz at the mouth of the Coari River in October 1691, the soldiers \\"cruelly killed very many people and took the rest away as slaves,\\" as Fritz later learned. Fritz then continued up the Huallaga River to Hu√°nuco, and thence to Lima, returning by way of Ja√©n to the missions of the Mara√±√≥n River in February 1692. In Lima he presented his report to the Viceroy Conde de la Monclova Melchor Portocarrero Lasso de la Vega, including a detailed map that he had made of the Amazon region. The Viceroy was so impressed with Fritz's work that he gave him a thousand silver pesos from the treasury and another thousand out of his own pocket for the purchase of \\"bells, ornaments and other costly articles conducive to the adornment and decent furnishing of his new churches.\\" Nonetheless, the Viceroy told Fritz that he seriously doubted that the production potential of the Amazon forests was sufficient to justify fighting the Portuguese to gain control of it, or even defending any particular outpost. Fritz's maps Fritz's 1707 map showing the Amazon and the Orinoco, on either side of the mythical Lake Parime Poorly equipped with instruments, Fritz completed a comparatively accurate chart of the course of the Amazon from Bel√©m to Quito. Fritz's maps were the first approximately correct charts of the Mara√±√≥n territory, and are noteworthy for their relatively precise delineation of the contours and proportions of the South American continent. They were the first to be drawn from personal experience by someone who had navigated the Amazon River from one end to the other. His intention was to obtain military and financial support from the colonial and royal authorities for the development of his missions among the tribes of the frontier. In all, Fritz produced at least six maps, possibly more, and of these only four have survived. In 1689 he created a draft map of the river during his journey to Par√°, presenting this to the governor there. During his imprisonment, he created a second draft of this map on four adjoining sheets of paper, which included the names of indigenous communities, Jesuit reductions, missionary settlements and ethnic groups.Samuel Fritz, Mapa Geographica del R√≠o Mara√±√≥n o Amazonas, (1691), Biblioth√®que Nationale de France, Paris, Cartes et plans, R√©s. Ge C 5037, Manuscript (ink on paper), 55 x 130 cm. Upon arriving in Lima in 1692, he created a larger version of this map to submit to the printer. Difficulties in reproducing this map prevented it from being printed, and a slightly altered version was finally published at Quito in 1707, under the title \\"The Great River Mara√±√≥n or Amazonas with the Mission of the Society of Jesus, geographically described by Samuel Fritz, settled missioner on said river.\\" This version is 126 by 46 cm and includes in the legend a detailed description of fauna and flora and indigenous ethnicity on the Amazon. Locations where missionaries were killed are marked with crosses. The original is in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France.Zdenƒõk H√ºbner, \\"Samuel Fritz\\" (in Czech) Fritz himself felt strongly that his map was far more accurate than other contemporary maps of the Amazon, writing: > \\"I created this map for a better understanding and general lesson about the > great Amazon, or Mara√±√≥n, with great effort and great work... Although many > other maps have appeared today, I want, without touching anyone, to say that > none of these maps is accurate because either the measurement on this great > river was not attentive or was not done at all, or it was written from the > writings of various authors.\\" A copy of the Quito engraving was sent to Madrid, by order of the Royal Audiencia of Quito, in the care of the procurator from the Jesuit province. But the ship was intercepted by the English, who published the map for the first time in 1712, with modifications and in a reduced scale.Edward Cooke.

One prominent error in the map is the inclusion of Lake Parime, of which Fritz knew only through hearsay, and which had been sought unsuccessfully since Sir Walter Raleigh had surmised its existence in 1595.Sir Walter Raleigh, The Discoverie of the Large, Rich, and Bewtiful Empyre of Guiana 1596; repr., Amsterdam: Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, 1968 Later explorers concluded that the lake was a myth.

Indigenous beliefs about Fritz In 1692, upon his return from being held prisoner by the Portuguese, Fritz discovered that an Omagua cult had grown up around claims that he possessed supernatural powers related to curing, rites of passage, and the movement of rivers, and a belief that Fritz himself was immortal. During his absence, in June 1690, a massive earthquake occurred,Alberto V. Veloso, \\"On the footprints of a major Brazilian Amazon earthquake,\\" An. Acad. Bras. Ci√™nc., vol. 86 no.3 Rio de Janeiro Sept. 2014. which was attributed by the Indians to the anger of their deities at Fritz's imprisonment. Rumors also spread that the Portuguese had cut Fritz into pieces, but that he had miraculously reassembled himself. Some of these beliefs, however, portrayed Fritz as evil.Frank Salomon, Stuart B. Schwartz, eds.Indians of South America, Part 1 Volume 3 of Cambridge history of the native peoples of the Americas, Cambridge University Press, 1999. Following a solar eclipse in June 1695, an Aisuari chief sent gifts to Fritz with a message begging him not to extinguish the sun. On a more practical note, many of the Indians viewed the presence of Spanish missionaries as protection against the Portuguese, who were subjecting indigenous communities to forced labor. Fritz understood that the Indians viewed him as different from other Europeans‚Äîmore kindly and patient, less self-serving, and not exploitative, in addition to being very possibly immortal. Once, when talking about the afterlife, he was interrupted by an Aisuari chief who said that Fritz could surely never die, because then there would be no one to serve as their \\"Father, Lover and Protector.\\" Conflict with the Portuguese Starting in 1693, Fritz began working to persuade the Omaguas in San Joaqu√≠n de Omaguas to give up their island communities and found new settlements on the nearby banks of the Amazon proper. Fritz wanted larger communities centered around a chapel or a church, and he recommended that these communities be defensible against the Portuguese slavers. In 1695 San Joaqu√≠n de Omaguas was relocated to the mouth of the Ampiyacu River in the traditional territory of the Caumaris. Gradually the community grew as people took refuge from the Caumaris and the Mayorunas, the traditional enemies of the Omaguas. Further to the east, Fritz established two other such reductions, San Pablo and Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe. Soon slave raids launched intermittently from Par√° (modern-day Bel√©m) became so intense and frequent that the Omaguas from distant communities, as well as neighboring Yurimaguas, fled to the comparative safety of the Jesuit mission settlements near the mouth of the Napo River, including San Joaquin de Omaguas. This influx of refugees contributed to a deterioration of the relationship between the Jesuits and the longer-term Omagua residents of the mission settlements. Many Omaguas were also leaving the Jesuit missions, tempted by materials and goods being distributed by the Carmelite missions which were competing with the Jesuits for mission converts. On 10 April 1697, at Nuestra Se√±ora de las Nieves, Fritz met Friar Manoel da Esperan√ßa, Vice-Provincial of the Portuguese Carmelites, and a group of Portuguese soldiers who had arrived saying that they intended to take possession of the Upper Solim√µes. Fritz told them: > \\"For over eight years I have been in peaceful possession of this mission on > behalf of the Crown of Castile. I formed a large part of these heathen > Indians into mission settlements, when some were wandering through the > forest as fugitives and others living in concealment near the lagoons > because of the murders and enslavements they formerly suffered from the men > of Par√°. I myself, when I was in that city [Belem], saw many slaves from > these tribes.\\" Nonetheless, the Portuguese demanded that Fritz relocate his > mission upstream, warning him that if he were caught by the Portuguese in > that region, he would be sent to prison in Portugal. The Omagua rebellion The process of relocation was difficult. In 1701, Omaguas in several settlements under the leadership of the Omagua cacique Payoreva, rose up against the Jesuit missionary presence, setting fire to the mission and killing some of the Jesuits. Fritz journeyed to Quito to request a small military force to quell the revolt, and subsequently instituted annual visits by secular military forces to intimidate the Omaguas and stave off potential uprisings.Lev Michael and Zachary O‚ÄôHagan, \\"A Linguistic Analysis of Old Omagua Ecclesiastical Texts,\\" University of California, Berkeley. Payoreva was arrested, flogged and imprisoned by the Spanish in Borja, however he escaped and returned to San Joaquin de los Omaguas in February 1702 to persuade the Omagua people to leave the influence of the missionaries, and most of the population left to establish new settlements along the Juru√° River. Fritz attempted to persuade the Omaguas to return to the mission and even promised a pardon for Chief Payoreva.Edmond Herbert Grove-Hills, Annexe au Contre-m√©moire, Vol. I; Imprim√© au Foreign Office, par Harrison and Sons, 1903. The Portuguese Carmelites met with Fritz again several times, negotiating for the rights to unrestricted control over the various tribes. Many of those who followed Payoreva were eventually enslaved by the Portuguese, as was Payoreva himself in 1704. The influence of the Carmelite missionaries became stronger after a visit by the Portuguese Friar Victoriano Pimentel in 1702. Pimentel discovered quickly that the Amazonians were interested in metal tools and other trade goods and that they could be persuaded to abandon the Jesuits by offerings of \\"hatchets, sickles, knives, fishhooks, pins, needles, ribbons, mirrors, reliquaries, rings and pieces of wire for their earrings.\\" Later life In 1704 Fritz succeeded Gaspar Vidal as Jesuit Superior relocating to Santiago de la Laguna on the Huallaga River. He left responsibility for the Omagua missions to the Sardinian Father Juan Baptista Sanna who had begun working among the Omagua people in 1701. In February 1709, the new king of Portugal, Jo√£o V, sent a large contingent of Portuguese soldiers to raid the Upper Solim√µes and to demand the withdrawal of all Spanish missionaries from the region. Fritz wrote to the Portuguese commander begging him to desist, but the Portuguese destroyed several Yurimagua and Omagua communities. Finally, in July, Spanish authorities sent a military force to drive the Portuguese out, burning several Carmelite missions in the process. The Portuguese retaliated in December, killing hundreds of Indians and taking many captives including Juan Baptista Sanna. He was imprisoned in Portugal for a short time and eventually sent on a mission to Japan. The fighting dispersed nearly all the Yurimagua and Omagua communities, and the survivors were devastated by a smallpox epidemic which began in April 1710 and left the formerly populous region of the Upper Solim√µes uninhabited. Fritz was replaced as Superior by Gregorio Bobadilla in December 1712, and in January 1714 he began missionary work in Limpia Concepci√≥n de Jeberos, where he would live until his death.Sierra, Vicente D. 1944.

Three of his letters are incorporated in the \\"N. Welt-Bott\\" (Augsburg, 1726), III, nos. 24, 25; and according to Condamine, an original report of his travels is to be found in the archives of the Jesuit college at Quito. Fritz proposed that the Mara√±√≥n River must be the source of the Amazon, noting on his 1707 map that the Mara√±√≥n \\"has its source on the southern shore of a lake that is called Lauricocha, near Hu√°nuco.\\" Fritz reasoned that the Mara√±√≥n River is the largest river branch one encounters when journeying upstream, and lies farther to the west than any other tributary of the Amazon. For most of the 18th‚Äì19th centuries and into the 20th century, the Mara√±√≥n River was generally considered the source of the Amazon.

It supports basic research through collaborative, interdisciplinary initiatives. The Institute brings together UBC scholars with researchers from around the world \\"to work together on innovative research, develop new thinking that is beyond disciplinary boundaries, and engage in intellectual risk-taking.\\" The Institute has a varied program of scholars in residence, visiting scholars, distinguished professorship, multiple speaker series, and major special events. Mission To create collaborative, interdisciplinary, basic research programs for scholars at all stages of their career. History In 1991, Vancouver property developer Peter Wall donated 6.5 million shares of the Wall Financial Corporation (at the time, it was worth CAD$15 million and the largest private donation received by the University of British Columbia) to fund the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced studies, which had been conceived by Wall and then UBC President David Strangway. Strangway was quoted as saying, \\"Peter realized that there was an opportunity to create a university- based institute for advanced research which doesn't exist anywhere else. He made it clear from the outset that the money had to be used to generate new ideas and initiatives that wouldn't happen otherwise.\\" As of March 2007, the market value of the shares stood at CAD$48 million. Also in 1994, the University dedicated a CAD$10 million Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies Endowment Fund to the Institute. The Institute began active operations in 1994 with the appointments of UBC Nobel Laureate in Chemistry Michael Smith (1932‚Äì2000), and Prof. Raphael Amit, then Director of UBC's W. Maurice Young Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital Research Centre, as Peter Wall Distinguished Professors. The Institute's first full-time director was Kenneth MacCrimmon from 1996 to 2002. The Institute acquired its own facilities at the Leon & Thea Koerner University Centre (formerly the Faculty Club) in 1999. In 2002, the Institute appointed as its new Peter Wall Distinguished Professor Dr. Brett Finlay, who teaches in the Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, the Department of Microbiology & Immunology, and at the Finlay Lab at the Michael Smith Laboratories at UBC, and whose research led to the developments of vaccines for SARS and E. coli. The professorship is valued at $100,000 per year for five years and is renewable for life. The Institute is a member of UBIAS and hosted its International Conference on September 17‚Äì19, 2013. It concluded Memoranda of Understanding with the Coll√®ge de France in 2008, the Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study (STIAS) in 2009, and the TUM Institute for Advanced Study in 2010. According to Chris McGill, who was Assistant to the Director from 1999-2004, \\"The Institute was not modelled on a particular centre or institute. The individuals involved in establishing the Peter Wall Institute and in developing its programs looked at a number of different models. The Rockefeller Foundation's Bellagio Study & Conference Center at Lake Como, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford were some of the facilities that were considered. By trying to adapt elements from each of these centres and institutes to the particular mandate of the Peter Wall Institute we have created a new and original form of research institute.\\" The most recent director of the Institute was Dr. Philippe Tortell, a Professor in the Departments of Botany and Earth, Ocean & Atmospheric Sciences at the University of British Columbia. Dr. Tortell resigned in protest against directives from the Board of Trustees, which he viewed as \\"wholly inconsistent with its mission and mandate\\" Programs The Institute's programs include: * The Peter Wall Distinguished Professorship. The University describes this as \\"one of UBC's highest honours\\".

Based on the combination of discontinued programs (Early Career Scholars, Distinguished Scholars in Residence, and Research Mentorship Awards), the Wall Scholars Research Award (worth $20,000) is given to exceptional UBC faculty, in any discipline and at any stage of their careers, to stay in residence at the Institute for one year and participate in a collaborative, interdisciplinary research environment. Part of the Wall Scholars program includes the Wall Wednesday Afternoon Series, an annual series of public forums held by each of the current Wall Scholars on a topic of their choice. * The International Visiting Research Scholar program. Select UBC faculty are granted partnership awards of $10,000 to bring an international scholar to UBC for a minimum of three weeks to collaborate on interdisciplinary research projects. * The International Research Roundtable program. The Institute funds and hosts up to five roundtables per year, during which local, national and international scholars, community leaders, artists, policy makers, and others come together in the pursuit of knowledge within an interdisciplinary environment. The roundtables foster collaborative, interdisciplinary approaches towards research centered on a broad-ranging theme, and may lead to important advances in science or solutions to important problems. The first International Roundtable Discussion, titled, \\"Rising from the Ashes: Resilience, Arts and Social Transformation,\\" was held in October 2012. * The Institute has partnered with the Consulate General of France in Vancouver to bring leading French scholars to UBC in a program titled \\"French Scholars Lecture Series / Cycle de conf√©renciers fran√ßais √† l'universit√© de Colombie-Britannique\\", inviting academics from France, from different disciplinary and research backgrounds, to participate in a dialogue with their Canadian counterparts. * International Exchanges. Under the memoranda of understanding with our International Partners, the Institute can welcome each year outstanding professors from the Coll√®ge de France within the context of its invited Wall Distinguished Visiting Professor program, and in turn, the Coll√®ge can invite up to three senior Faculty Associates of the Institute for one month under the rubric of its International Exchanges program. The Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study (STIAS) welcomes senior Faculty Associates of the Institute for fellowships of three months or longer. The Institute and TUM Institute for Advanced Study will arrange annual brief exchanges of small, interdisciplinary research clusters with interests in a common topic. * Wall Colloquia Abroad. These are small meetings to which scholars from a range of disciplines, from UBC and abroad, are brought together for a few days to develop and further research agendas on cutting edge topics. Holding the meetings in other parts of the world will enable key researchers to attend who might otherwise not be able to do so. * Theme Development Workshops. The Institute provides a venue and refreshments to UBC faculty who wish to meet and discuss potential collaborative research projects, themes, and research funding proposals involving multiple academic disciplines and faculties. * Arts-Based Initiatives. Researchers at the Peter Wall Institute have adapted arts-based approaches (drama, poetry, visual arts, dance and song) to offer alternative ways of exploring important research questions as well as disseminating research findings to diverse audiences. The Institute has hosted a Wall Composer in Residence, Wall Author in Residence, Wall International Visiting Artists, as well as a large number of arts-based forums and performances.

He and his brother John Tolbert were both deputy marshals under \\"The Hanging Judge\\" Isaac Parker. One of many young deputies first used by Judge Parker in the U.S. District Courts in Fort Smith and Muskogee, Tolbert was part of a legendary generation of U.S. Marshals that also included J.H.

Biography Early life The eldest of eight children born to James Russell Tolbert and Elizabeth Miller, Paden Tolbert grew up in Griffin, Georgia during Reconstruction. The Tolbert family had been well off prior to the American Civil War, his father James had graduated from the University of Georgia and studied law in Tennessee before becoming a journalist. His family lived in Macon and Atlanta during the war while his father reported for the Atlanta Constitution and afterwards tried his hand at farming in Pike County but was unsuccessful at it. In 1880, his father sold the family estate in Griffin and traveled by train to Clarksville, Arkansas where he became successful in growing peach trees and introducing the Elberta peach. Tolbert became a schoolmaster in Johnson County for a time before pursuing a career as a law enforcement officer. He traveled to Fort Smith and, at age 22, became a deputy U.S. Marshal under \\"The Hanging Judge\\" Isaac Parker. Prior to this, he had married his childhood sweetheart Lucy Rose Turner and moved their family to the Indian Territory shortly after becoming a deputy marshal. His brother John would also become a deputy marshal at Fort Smith and the two would briefly work together. Another deputy he was partnered with was Bud Ledbetter who together hunted down many notorious outlaws in the Indian Territory.

(pg. 115) On the morning of November 2, 1894, Tolbert and the rest of the posse surrounded the near impregnable wooden fortress known as the \\"Rabbit Trap\\" in the Going Snake District, a mountainous region of the Cherokee nation (near present-day Talequah, Oklahoma). Christie had successfully fought off previous attempts to apprehend him for well over a year before their arrival. After cannon fire and over 2,000 bullets fired at the double-tiered log fortification proved ineffective, it seemed that this would again be the case. As night fell, Tolbert and the others set to work on building a portable barricade. Using the charred rear axle and wheels from the burned out lumber wagon used to assault the fort the previous month, they built and mounted a thick wall from scrap-oak timbers and loaded with rails. Finally, six sticks of dynamite was brought out and used to breach the fort's walls. Sometime near midnight, Tolbert helped push the wagon towards the cabin along with White, Charley Copeland, Bill Ellis and Bill Smith. While Christie and his partner attempted to fight off Paden's group from the second story gunports, the rest of the posse provided covering fire until the men were close enough to dynamite the south wall of the house. Although surviving the explosion, Christie made a run for the surrounding woods but was gunned down by Tolbert and others.Neal, Bill. Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1991. (pg. 60) Shootout with Texas Jack Reed Two years later, Tolbert and several other U.S. Marshals were contacted by the American Express Company to request protection because they had received information of a suspected holdup from one of their agents in Dallas. On November 13, 1894, Tolbert and Ledbetter were aboard the express car along with Sid Johnson, Frank Jones and as many as three Pinkerton detectives. The train was moving at top speed when it was stopped by Nathaniel \\"Texas Jack\\" Reed and his gang. Although calling on the lawmen to get out of the express car, Tolbert and the others refused to surrender and instead began firing at them. The gunfight continued for over an hour and a half until one of Reed's men, Charley Belstead, was killed. Reed then ran towards the passenger car, carrying dynamite with him, and tried to blow the express car. Failing this, he instead held up the passenger car. Erroneously reported killed as he and his men made their getaway, Reed was nevertheless wounded by Ledbetter. The failure of this attack resulted in a manhunt for the fugitives and the eventual capture of Reed.Wilson, R. Michael. Great Train Robberies of the Old West. Guilford, Connecticut: Globe Pequot, 2007. (pg. 95) Capture of the Jenning Gang and later life In mid-July 1897, Tolbert and Ledbetter again rode together to bring in members of the Jennings Gang, brothers Alan and Frank Jennings. During their search, they learned that \\"Al Jennings and other parties ... who were going about in the Northern District of the Indian Territory under assumed names\\". Tolbert and Ledbetter were sent after them with a warrant for their robbery of a post office at Foyll in Cherokee territory. They stayed on their trail for some time before tracking them to the Spike S ranch and, along with several others, surrounded the hideout. After a brief gunfight, they chased them a distance of 60 miles before apprehending them together with Pat and Morris O'Malley.Shirley, Glenn. West of Hell's Fringe: Crime, Criminals, and the Federal Peace Officer in Oklahoma Territory, 1899-1907. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1978. (391-392, 408-409) After a successful 12-year career, Tolbert retired and became a special officer for Fort Smith and Western Railroad. After only a few months, he became ill from congestion of the lungs and sent to Hot Springs, Arkansas to recover. However, his condition did not improve and he died in Weleetka, Oklahoma on April 24, 1904 and was buried in Oakland Cemetery near Clarksville, Arkansas four days later. Following his death, his widow was appointed honorary postmistress of Paden, a town in the Indian Territory named after her husband. References Further reading *Drago, Harry Sinclair.

However, Jacobs was later vindicated when Chizik, in his second year, won the 2011 BCS National Championship Game. 2010 basketball coaching change In March 2010, Jacobs dismissed former Auburn men's basketball coach Jeff Lebo. Lebo had been at Auburn for six years, had a losing record, and his teams had failed to make the NCAA Tournament in any season. Jacobs replaced him with Tony Barbee.

He served as the athletic director at the University of Alabama from 1999 to 2013. On November 23, 1999, he was hired as athletic director after spending almost thirty years in other areas with the university. As a player, coach, and director of athletics, Moore was part of ten national championship football teams. In May 2012, he was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. Moore died March 30, 2013 in Durham, North Carolina. Early years and education One of seven children, Moore was born December 19, 1939 in Dozier, Alabama, the son of Dempsey Clark Moore (1895‚Äì1970) and Fannie Bozeman Moore (1905-2000). As a scholarship player from 1958 to 1962, Moore played as a career backup quarterback for legendary coach Bear Bryant, behind Pat Trammell and subsequently Joe Namath. During his college career at Alabama, Moore earned his bachelor's degree in sociology in 1963 and his master's degree in secondary education in 1964. After he earned his master's degree, at Coach Bryant's suggestion, he joined the Alabama Air National Guard. Coaching career During a coaching career that spanned 31 years, Moore spent 22 of those at Alabama with stops at Montana State, Notre Dame and the NFL's St. Louis and Phoenix Cardinals. At Alabama, Moore began as Bryant's graduate assistant in 1964, then as defensive backfield coach for six seasons (1965‚Äì70) before becoming quarterbacks coach from 1971‚Äì82 and serving as the Tide's offensive coordinator starting in 1975. Moore was instrumental in the installation and implementation of the wishbone offense at Alabama prior to the 1971 season. The move to the wishbone led to an unprecedented decade of success for Bryant and the Crimson Tide. During the wishbone era, Alabama set school records that still stand for yards gained per game (480.7 in 1973), rushing attempts in a season (763 in 1979), rushing yards gained in a season (4,027 in 1973), rushing yards per game for a season (366.1 in 1973), yards per rush for a season (6.06 in 1973), rushing touchdowns (43 in 1973), passing yards per attempt for a season (13.4 in 1973), fewest punts in a season (39 in 1973), rushing first downs in a season (213 in 1979), total offense in a game (833 vs. Virginia Tech in 1973) and rushing yards in a game (748 vs. Virginia Tech in 1973). Moore returned as offensive coordinator under Gene Stallings from 1990-93 before moving into athletic administration. Athletic director In 1994, because of his wife's illness, Moore left coaching and moved into the UA Athletic Department as one of the many legacy projects placed in assistant athletic director's positions. An enormously popular figure in the history of University of Alabama athletics, Mal Moore's personal style as Director of Athletics from 1999-2013 generated devotion from the University community at-large, as well as the employees of the department that he oversaw. After building an impeccable reputation as an assistant football coach at Alabama, Notre Dame and in the National Football League, Moore's enormous success as an athletics administrator was largely personal, as he skillfully and successfully dealt with issues and initiatives that required the cooperation of numerous campus and statewide entities. Moore's superb talent for gaining the respect and affection of those he worked with, as well as those that worked for him, revealed him to be the man perfectly suited to guide Alabama Athletics through a turbulent period into an era of success and prosperity. Moore possessed a gift for inspiring confidence by harmonizing diverse groups and disparate personalities into a smoothly functioning coalition. Moore's term as Director of Athletics was a personal triumph. The good-natured sincerity with which he conducted business created an uncomplicated atmosphere that disarmed potential critics and comforted his underlings. Bestowed with the power to lead, he did so through a spirit of conciliation and persuasion. He made complex issues simple and allowed his department to focus on the job at hand. After an exhaustive search by the UA Board of Trustees, Moore took over as Athletic Director in 1999. Moore was instrumental in the hiring of four head football coaches including Dennis Franchione, Mike Price, Mike Shula, and Nick Saban. He also oversaw various facility improvements: Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium expanded to its current capacity of over 101,000 seats, renovations were made to Coleman Coliseum in 2005, as well as new tennis, soccer, and softball stadiums. The University of Alabama's Director of Athletics from 1999 to 2013, Moore was a football player under legendary Crimson Tide head coach Paul W. ‚ÄúBear‚Äù Bryant from 1958‚Äì62 and went on to serve as an assistant football coach on Bryant's staff. Moore held the distinction of being a part of ten national championship teams as a player, coach and athletics director (1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978, 1979, 1992, 2009, 2011 and 2012), 16 SEC championships, and 39 bowl trips. He is the only individual connected with the Tide program ‚Äì and likely the only person in collegiate athletics ‚Äì to be a part of ten national football championships. As Director of Athletics, Moore made an indelible mark on one of the nation's most storied athletic programs, leading a department through a period of growth and success both athletically and academically. Moore's vision was to make all Crimson Tide athletic teams and student-athletes nationally competitive at the highest level. His leadership elevated Alabama's athletic facilities to premier status nationally for all sports. During Moore's tenure as Director of Athletics, Alabama produced national championship teams in football, gymnastics, softball, men's golf and women's golf as well as Southeastern Conference championships in football, basketball, baseball, gymnastics, men's and women's golf, men's cross country and softball. Alabama athletes earned some of the highest honors the SEC and NCAA have to offer, including SEC Athlete of the Year, SEC Scholar-Athlete of the Year and NCAA Sportsperson of the Year. Moore's commitment to excellence has also extended to the classroom as Alabama saw major improvements in scholarship athletic graduation rates and had over 62 Academic All-Americans under Moore's leadership. Under Moore's watch, Alabama has produced 19 NCAA Post Graduate Scholarship winners, 11 NCAA Top VIII selections, three NCAA Woman of the Year finalists, two Campbell Trophy finalists, a Campbell Trophy winner and a Wuerffel award winner.http://www.footballfoundation.org/News/NewsDetail/tabid/567/Article/51622/mal- moore-named-winner-of-national-football-foundations-john-l-toner- award.aspx2104 Alabama Football Media Guide In 2011, the Alabama Football team received the Disney Spirit Award for community service. Moore directed more than $240 million of capital improvements to University of Alabama athletic facilities. Those projects encompassed the entire scope of all Crimson Tide athletic programs and benefited every Alabama student-athlete, coach, and administrator. Throughout his administrative career, Moore worked with a diversified field of constituents, from fellow coaches and former players, to fans and the business community. All of those experiences and relationships ‚Äì in addition to his ability to unify those many constituents ‚Äì made him uniquely qualified to lead Alabama athletics in the 21st century. Moore's dedication to and love of the University of Alabama was recognized on March 28, 2007, when, as a permanent tribute to his lifelong contribution to The University of Alabama, the Board of Trustees of The University of Alabama officially dedicated the facility formerly known as The Football Building as the Mal M. Moore Athletic Facility. In 2011, he was elected to the State of Alabama Sports Hall of Fame for his accomplishments as a coach and an administrator. After the completion of the 2011-12 academic and athletic seasons, Moore was named the winner of the John L. Toner Award, given to the nation's best athletic director. In 2012, the City of Tuscaloosa honored him and his late wife Charlotte by naming the new Caring Days program the Mal and Charlotte Moore Center, a facility that serves as a day program for adults with Alzheimer's and other memory disorders. Personal life Moore married Charlotte Moore (n√©e Davis) on July 20, 1968, and had one daughter (Heather) during their marriage. His wife died on January 18, 2010, after battling with Alzheimer's since 1990. On March 30, 2013, Moore died at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, of pulmonary problems at the age of 73. He was survived by one daughter, Heather Cook of Scottsdale, Arizona, a granddaughter, Anna Lee, and a grandson, Charles Cannon.

See History of Northeast Indiana, Chicago & New York: Lewis Publishing Co., 1920, v. 1, p. 311. The town was founded in 1838 by Thomas Gale, a native of New York who was also a Spiritualist and vocal abolitionist. See Cindy Bevington, Angola: pioneers, progress and passionate beliefs . Steuben County also had an active Underground Railroad movement in the 1850s. Id., pp. 191-192. By 1862, however, a reaction to the anti-slavery movement began to show itself in Steuben County.

Representatives were elected for one-year terms under the Indiana Constitution of 1816. See Indiana Constitution of 1816, Article III, Section 3. Under the law adopted for calling the Constitutional Convention of 1850, May's election to the legislature in 1850 automatically made him a delegate to the convention.The Indiana Historian, Indianapolis, IN: Indiana Historical Bureau June 2002, p. 4, col. 2.

Voting rights under the Constitution of 1816 Although Indiana's first constitution, adopted in 1816, did not specifically bar voting by African Americans or other persons of color, it guaranteed the right to vote only to white male citizens over the age of 21 who had lived in the state for one year.Indiana Constitution of 1816, Article VI . Although the Convention of 1850 adopted an article specifically prohibiting African Americans from voting, it nonetheless debated the issue of letting them vote.

The Constitutional Convention convened here on October 7, 1850, then moved to the nearby Masonic lodge where it met from December 26, 1850 to February 10, 1851. On October 28, 1850, the Convention took up two petitions on behalf of African American rights: one from \\"certain persons of color residing in Allen county;\\" and one \\"from certain inhabitants of Steuben county on behalf of the colored race.\\" Report of the debates and proceedings of the Convention for the revision of the constitution of the state of Indiana, Indianapolis: A.H. Brown, 1851, v. 1, p. 242. Determination of what to do with the petitions was tabled until the Convention could dispose of a proposal by delegate Schuyler Colfax (a future Vice President of the United States) to have a committee inquiry regarding \\"the expediency of separately submitting the question of negro suffrage to the people.\\" Id., p. 244 Delegate George Berry of Franklin County moved to amend Colfax's motion to make it a direct instruction to the committee to approve a provision \\"making negroes and mulattoes voters at all elections in this state.\\" Id. May then rose to propose amending Berry's amendment to allow the committee to propose \\"such restrictions and qualifications\\" on African American voters as the committee \\"might deem necessary.\\" Id. On its face, May's proposal does not appear to be a particularly strong endorsement of African American voting rights, but it permitted him to launch into a speech in which he ridiculed what he saw as the hypocritical attitudes of most of the delegates on racial questions. Although May defended giving the voting franchise to African Americans subject to qualifications such as, perhaps, property ownership, he compared the possible restrictions to those placed on immigrants from Sweden and Germany, who were not immediately allowed all of the rights of citizenship. Id., p. 245 The main point of May's speech, however, was not to propose voting restrictions as such but to force the delegates to step back from an uncompromising opposition to African American suffrage. May said: After challenging the Convention \\"to declare under what circumstances, coupled with what restrictions, they [African Americans] shall enjoy the rights and privileges of men,\\" Id. May made an ironic observation about the majority's apparent willingness to tax African Americans without giving them the vote: May's amendment to Berry's proposed amendment failed on a voice vote.Id., p. 253 When Berry's amendment came up for a recorded vote, even Berry deserted it, leaving May, in a vote of 122 to 1, as the only delegate to support the principle of unqualified suffrage for African American males.Id., pp. 253-254 African American suffrage in the Constitution of 1851 On August 4, 1851, Indiana voters ratified the new constitution in a referendum. Indiana Historical Bureau: The 1851 Indiana Constitution by David G. Vanderstel Article 2, Section 5, as approved, read: \\"No Negro or Mulatto shall have the right of suffrage.\\" : The 1851 document also contained an article, adopted as a separate question by voters in the referendum, barring new African American immigration into the state.Indiana Constitution of 1851, Article 13 (as originally adopted) May opposed the immigration ban Id., p. 454 and May's home county of Steuben was one of only three of Indiana's 92 counties to vote against excluding African Americans from the state.The other two counties were LaGrange and Randolph.

He did not seek re-election to the legislature.The 1885 History of DeKalb County (supra) does not show May's name in the election returns for 1851. In 1852, May and his wife moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota, where both of them died, apparently of cholera.The Amherst College Biographical Record reports that May died Aug. 2, 1854; the History of Northeast Indiana says that the year was 1852 and gives the cause of death as cholera. The Biographical Directory of the Indiana General Assembly reports that he died July 17, 1854, and that his wife also died in 1854, leading to the conclusion that both died in an epidemic, although the 1854 date is suspect for both of them. There was a major outbreak of cholera in Saint Paul in 1852 (See St. Joseph‚Äôs Hospital: Historical Timeline ), a fact that lends weight to the earlier date. Here is May's biographical sketch as it appeared in the History of Steuben County, Indiana, Chicago: Inter-State Publishing Co., 1886, p. 408: > Hon. Edward R. May graduated at Yale College in 1838, and although one of > the youngest members of his class, he had acquired a reputation which gave > promise of future distinction.

It would have had a crew of 5 and was propelled by a Wright R975 EC2 gasoline-fueled engine giving the vehicle a top speed of 25 miles-per-hour (40 kilometers-per-hour). The Gross weight of the vehicle was 33 Tons. The M3 Hull served in many front line tanks as the Americans found it useful, this hull went on to be used up until 1942 in which the M4 was made and can be seen in all Sherman tanks. The M3 hull gave the T40 a lower profile in which was useful in battlefield situations. Three double-wheeled bogies were situated on either side of the hull. History The T40 was the T24 prototype rebuilt by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1941 on the existing M3 Lee chassis. The growing tensions between the United States and the Empire of Japan made it clear that anti-armour machinery was needed. Shortly after Pearl Harbor the US Army had issued a 1,000 vehicle production license under the designation M9 in December, 1941. However, the project was terminated in August 1942. As well as doubts in the Ordnance Board about the design, the Tank Destroyer Board felt that the vehicle was too slow and there were only about 30 M1918 guns available to produce the vehicle.Zaloga p6-7 After the cancellation focus shifted into making the M10 \\"Wolverine\\" tank destroyer.

Bob Wills and Tommy Duncan added words and music to the melody of the traditional fiddle tune \\"Walkin' Georgia Rose\\" in 1940. The song is one of eight country music performances selected for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock & Roll\\".Sullivan, Steve, Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings, vol. 3 & 4, (Rowman & Littlefield 2017) Song \\"Take me Back to Tulsa\\" features one of Western Swing's greatest bands in full flight. It originated as a Bob Wills fiddle tune and was so popular at shows that Wills and singer Tommy Duncan added words and recorded it in early 1941. Musically, the song has been described as a \\"jubilant Western Swing romp\\", with Wills urging fiddler Louis Tireney to \\"turn it on boy, turn it on\\" half way through the song. Wills's organization was based in Tulsa from 1934 to 1942, and the song takes its name from the chorus: \\"Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry\\". Lyrically, the song is a series of unrelated, mostly nonsense, rhyming couplets. One was: The last quoted line was changed by 1946 by Wills to: \\"Little man raise the cotton, beer joints get the money.\\"Bob Wills, Tiffany Transcriptions, vol. 2 (Modern covers of the song have tended to use the line: \\"Poor boy picks the cotton, Rich man gets the money\\"). When Wills was asked about the lines, he said they were just nonsense lyrics that he learned as a youth.Peterson, \\"Class Unconsciousness in Country Music\\", p. 54: \\"Years later Bob Wills said these were just 'nonsense lyrics that went with the tune,' one of many he learned as a youth when he absorbed every bit of blues and jazz from blacks that he could.\\" When played at Cain's Ballroom in Tulsa and other venues, it often included the lines: Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys recorded \\"Take Me Back to Tulsa\\" on February 25, 1941 in Dallas, Texas (OKeh 6101) and it became one of their larger hits. Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys previously performed the song in his 1940 movie Take Me Back to Oklahoma. Spade Cooley's Western Dance Gang also performed it in their 1944 short movie titled for the song, Take Me Back to Tulsa. The song has been recorded by many other artists over the years. Errata Al Dexter is sometimes erroneously credited with writing \\"Take Me Back to Tulsa\\", perhaps due to his musically similar hit song \\"Pistol Packin' Mama\\".Carlin, Country Music, p. 103: \\"Besides \\"[Pistol Packin'] Mama,' [Al] Dexter wrote the words to Bob Wills's theme song, 'Take Me Back to Tulsa,' the ever-popular 'Rosalita,' the barroom weeper 'Too Blue to Cry,' and the upbeat cowboy number 'so Long, Pal'.\\"Coleman, Playback, p. 48: \\"He [Al Dexter] freely admitted to borrowing from western swing icon Bob Wills; in fact, 'Pistol Packin' Mama' bears a close, almost fraternal resemblance to Wills's 'Take Me Back to Tulsa'.\\" Covers The country music group Asleep at the Wheel covered the song on their 1973 album Comin' Right at Ya.

It crossed the Columbia River in central Washington, connecting Pasco and Kennewick, two of the Tri-Cities. Succeeded by the Cable Bridge in 1978, it was demolished in 1990 at age 68\\\\. Construction The bridge was completed in 1922 after only a year of construction, replacing an outmoded ferry system in which a single trip transported a maximum of six cars across the Columbia River. It was in fact the first bridge for vehicular traffic across the middle part of the Columbia River (only ferries and rail bridges were previously available). Originally planned in 1913 by B. B. Horrigan, funding was not secured until 1919, when Charles G. Huber of the Union Bridge Company sold $49,000 worth of stock to finance the project, despite the country being in the grips of the Post-World War I recession. It was the first bridge of that size to be financed entirely with stock sales, and was a toll bridge for the first nine years; tolls were removed once the initial construction costs ($480,000) had been repaid. It was also the first of three cantilever bridges built over the Columbia River in the 1920s. The construction of the bridge was seen as a landmark in the development of the state's economy. The significance of the bridge is partly reflected in the beliefs and expectations of local and state residents who perceived the dedication as a history-making event, bringing together people from across the state; a gala affair that included speeches, car caravans, picnics, street dancing, and carnivals. As the Kennewick Courier-Reporter wrote, \\"The day the bridge was opened to traffic, a new era dawned for each community.\\" The bridge was also an essential part of the old Inland Empire Highway system. Not only did it transform the nickname \\"Twin Cities\\" into reality, but it was also a major crossing of the Columbia River, thereby making it an important part of the transcontinental Yellowstone Trail, and marked the first time that eastern and western halves of the state cooperated in the construction of something that was beneficial to both. The state of Washington purchased the bridge in 1931 and added it to the state highway system in 1933. Benton and Franklin counties took ownership of the bridge in 1954, and then sold it to the cities of Pasco and Kennewick in 1968 for one dollar, which allowed the counties to begin planning the construction of the newer Cable Bridge. Use Four years after its construction, the Green Bridge carried the newly formed US 410 between Kennewick and Pasco. In 1967, US 410 was decommissioned when US 12 was expanded from Lewiston to Aberdeen. The Green Bridge carried US 12 until its closure in 1978. Demolition After the completion of the Cable Bridge, bridge preservationists led by Virginia Devine succeeded in placing the Pasco- Kennewick Bridge on the National Register of Historic Places. As a result, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation came to an agreement with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Washington state historic preservation office such that if the state wanted to demolish the bridge, it would then be subject to a popular vote. In 1980, citizens of both Pasco and Kennewick voted in favor of its demolition, which then triggered a review by the FHWA to determine if any alternative uses could save the bridge from destruction. Preservationists submitted alternative plans to the FHWA, but the FHWA subsequently ruled that none of them were feasible or prudent. A lawsuit followed, with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington ruling in favor of the FHWA. The case was then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, whereupon the earlier ruling was overturned, with the order for the FHWA to conduct a more thorough review.Jackson & McCullough, pp. 68‚Äì70 However, the FHWA still came to the same conclusion and the bridge was dismantled in March 1990, with most of the piers removed by the end of 1991. One pier, as well as several wood and concrete footings portions several meters above the river bottom only visible while scuba diving, remains and serves as a scenic lookout from which the newer bridge may be seen.

His initial medical training was at Guy's Hospital, followed by specialised training at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. Contributions to neurology by Symonds include a highly accurate description of subarachnoid haemorrhage in 1924, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (which he termed \\"otitic hydrocephalus\\") in 1931. He served in both the First and Second World Wars, initially in the ranks as a motorcycle despatch rider on the Western Front. After being wounded and invalided back to the United Kingdom, he completed his basic medical training and served as a medical officer, both on the front lines and attached to the Royal Flying Corps at Farnborough. In the mid-1930s he became a civilian consultant to the Royal Air Force and on the outbreak of the Second World War was commissioned as a group captain. By the end of the war he held the acting rank of air vice marshal and had been knighted. Early life Symonds was born in London on 11 April 1890 to the Canadian-born Sir Charters Symonds, surgeon to Guy's Hospital, and his wife, Fanny Marie (n√©e Shaw). Symonds was educated at Rugby School and then proceeded to New College, Oxford on a classics scholarship. He soon changed his degree course to medicine, and took a second class honours degree in physiology in 1912. He then continued his medical training at Guy's on a scholarship. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War, Symonds left his medical studies and joined the British Army, serving as a despatch rider in the motorcycle section of the Royal Engineers. Attached to the 1st Division (sources are unclear if this was 1st Infantry Division or 1st Cavalry Division), he saw action at the Retreat from Mons, then in the battles of Marne and Aisne. He was wounded at the start of the Race to the Sea in September 1914, and was awarded the M√©daille militaire, and then returned to his medical studies at Guy's. He qualified as a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (LRCP) early in 1915, and was then commissioned into the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was initially attached to the Royal Flying Corps at Farnborough, gaining his first experience of aviation medicine. In this role he also regularly visited Aldershot where he worked with Edgar Adrian, a neurologist, and this was when he decided to specialise in neurology himself. He married Janet (n√©e Palmer), daughter of Edward Bagnall Poulton in 1915, they were to have two sons, one of whom was the political satirist Richard Symonds. After his MRCP in 1916 he returned to France with 101 Field Ambulance and medical officer to 1st battalion, the Middlesex Regiment, and was promoted temporary captain on 8 May 1916, He resigned his commission on the grounds of ill-health contracted on active service on 2 February 1919. Inter-war years Symonds completed his medical studies in 1919, gaining his MB BCh and also his Oxford Master of Arts and Doctor of Medicine. He was then appointed to the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and in 1920 to Guy's as assistant physician for nervous diseases. His first wife died in 1919. In 1920 he received a Radcliffe travelling fellowship, which he used to travel to the United States, studying psychiatry with Adolf Meyer at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore and neurosurgery with Harvey Cushing at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, Boston. In America he met and married his second wife Edythe Eva (n√©e Dorton), with whom he had two sons. He contributed the neurological section to Practice of Medicine (12th edn, 1922 ed. Sir Frederick Taylor). In Boston, he described subarachnoid haemorrhage in 1924, in which year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (FRCP). He returned to the National Hospital in London in 1926, and was also appointed consultant in neurology to the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital. From his observations of patients in these hospitals he published his description of what he named \\"otitic hydrocephalus\\" in 1931. The condition is now known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Reprinted as Second World War Having been appointed a civilian consultant in neurology to the RAF in 1934, he was commissioned as a group captain on 11 September 1939, just after the outbreak of the Second World War. He initially worked on the RAF medical boards at the RAF's Central Medical Establishment, RAF Halton, and organised the establishment of the Military Hospital for Head Injuries at St Hugh's College, Oxford in partnership with Hugh Cairns. As the war progressed, much of his work centred on a condition called \\"flying stress\\", with Denis Williams he analysed over 3000 case studies leading to the report Clinical and Statistical Study of Neurosis Precipitated by Flying Duties for which Symonds was awarded the 1949 Raymond F. Longacre award, administered by the U.S. Aerospace Medical Association (AsMA), for scientific contribution to aviation medicine. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1944 New Year Honours, by which time he was an acting air commodore and on 16 January he was promoted acting air vice marshal. He retired from the RAF in 1945, and was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1946 New Year Honours. Later life Symonds then returned to hospital practice, publishing more important papers, and becoming a highly regarded teacher. In 1952 he was appointed Sir Arthur Sims Commonwealth travelling professor for 1953, visiting Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. This was followed by appointments as visiting professor in San Francisco, and at the Montreal Neurological Institute. He was visiting neurologist at Johns Hopkins; an honorary member of both the American Neurological Association and the New York Neurological Association; corresponding member of the Soci√©t√© de Neurologie de Paris; president of both the neurological and psychiatric sections of the Royal Society of Medicine (RSM); and an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. In 1954 he gave the Harveian Oration at the Royal College of Physicians on 18 October and in 1956 was elected president on the Association of British Neurologists. He retired from practice in 1963, moving to Ham, Wiltshire and was elected an honorary fellow of the RSM in 1964. In retirement he enjoyed bird-watching and fly-fishing. He continued to publish, in particular a 1970 edition of his own papers entitled Studies in Neurology. He died in Totteridge, north London on 7 December 1978.

(c. 1512 ‚Äì 4 January 1577) was an Irish Roman Catholic prelate and Bishop of Meath, Ireland recognised by both the Crown and the Vatican from 1554 to 1560 and recognised by the Vatican from 1554 to 1577. After he ceased to be recognized by the Crown, he was in Ireland for a brief period from April 1575. Biography William Walsh was born at Dunboyne early in the 16th century, and was appointed, by the Pope, Bishop of Meath in 1554. He enjoyed more than one office under Elizabeth, but refusing in 1560 to conform in matters of religion, was first imprisoned and afterwards deprived of his bishopric. He was subsequently set free, but was again cast into prison in 1565. On 16 July, Adam Loftus, the Archbishop of Armagh, wrote to Cecil: > \\"He refused the oath, ... and openly showed himself to be a misliker of all > the Queen's Majesty's proceedings. He openly protested before all the > people, the same day he was before us, that he would never communicate or be > present, by his will, where the service should be ministered, for it was > against his conscience, and, as he thought, against God's Word. ... It were > fit he should be sent to England, and peradventure by conferring with the > learned bishops there he might be brought to some conformity. He is one of > great credit amongst his countrymen, and upon whom, as touching causes of > religion, they wholly depend.\\" After enduring seven years' imprisonment, he escaped to France about 1572. He appears to have returned to Ireland and resumed his episcopal functions in 1575, as in April of that year he had a brief from Rome empowering him to act for the dioceses of Armagh and Dublin, as well as Meath. Bishop Walsh subsequently retired to Spain, where he held the position of suffragan to the Archbishop of Toledo. He died at Alcal√°, 4 January 1577.

Overview Hanley's text, which intertwines fiction, memoir, and literary criticism, examines women's war stories. She argues that fiction organizes, shapes, and ultimately creates perception, stating in her introduction that, \\"our fictions have power, they shape our memories of the past and they create memories of pasts we have never had, of experiences not even remotely like anything that has ever happened to us. And these narratives of exotic experiences may have the most power over us of all, because we can't challenge their authenticity with the evidence of our own senses.\\" She thus begins her text with a critique of Paul Fussell's The Great War and Modern Memory (1975) as too narrow in its vision of war (focusing primarily on the experiences of male combatants). In contrast, through the juxtaposition of narrative and criticism (in particular, analysis of Virginia Woolf's Three Guineas and works by Joan Didion and Doris Lessing), Hanley offers portraits of women which she argues will \\"displace the soldier as the mouthpiece of war [...] the stories assume that women, children, noncombatants, and the enemy have an experience of war as much worth telling and remembering as is the story of any soldier.\\" Reviews B. Adler in Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries argues that \\"Hanley's short stories, her war literature, cover the impact and aftermath of war. The stories movingly express fear, dislocation, monstrousness. Both essays and stories are accessible, a clear explication of an important feminist critical stance. Highly recommended.\\" Arlene Kaplan Daniels in Signs notes that \\"Hanley's advisors warned her that mixed genres will not work. But this book does work. It is a beautifully written, thoughtful, combination of essays and stories about the effects of war on women and children [...] the essays and the stories are a pleasure to read. Combined they offer a wonderful antidote to the bellicosity and rejoicing in battle that often color the reminiscences found in war literature.\\" Notes External links * Writing War: Fiction, Gender and Memory.

Biography Silas was born Saleh Hardoon (◊°◊ê◊ú◊ó ◊ó◊®◊ì◊ï◊ü) into a poor Jewish family in Baghdad. His family left Baghdad for Mumbai, India where he was educated at a charitable school funded by David Sassoon. In 1868 Silas Aaron Hardoon traveled to the city of Shanghai (China), where he was employed by David Sassoon & Company as a rent collector and watchman. He quickly rose through the ranks of the company, displaying a talent for real estate. After leaving David Sassoon & Company in 1882 he tried to set up his own cotton trading company. After three years he gave up his business and joined E.D. Sassoon & Co. as their branch manager in Shanghai. The China land boom convinced Hardoon to leave the company in 1920.Stanley Jackson: \\"The Sassoons ‚Äì Portrait of a Dynasty\\", William Heinemann Ltd., London 1968, p.65 and 201, Shrewd investments, particularly in properties on Shanghai's \\"Fifth Avenue,\\" Nanking Road, eventually made him one of that city's wealthiest inhabitants. In fact, Silas Hardoon was the man who funded the building and construction of the original Nanking Road. This is the section that comprises the still standing art-deco style buildings that can be seen today. In early 1920 the future Chinese leader Mao Zedong stayed in Shanghai at a property owned by Hardoon on present-day Anyi Road. Hardoon lived with his Eurasian wife Luo Jialing (n√©e Liza Roos 1864‚Äì1941), a devout Buddhist, in the Aili Park, a 26-acre estate (now the Shanghai Exhibition Centre), and personally financed the printing of Buddhist writings. At one point he was the richest person in Asia and one of the richest in the world. When he died in 1931, his personal fortune was estimated at $650 million, equivalent to around $15 billion in current dollars. After Hardoon's death, Liza and the couple's adopted children fought amongst themselves, and with Hardoon's Iraqi family members, for Hardoon's estate in a series of lawsuits spanning 16 years. The Hardoon Inheritance Case is referred to as the most famous inheritance case in Shanghai's history. The case between Liza's family and Hardoon's Iraqi relatives was fought before the British Supreme Court for China in Shanghai, with a side action in Baghdad, and ended with a finding in favour of Liza in 1937. The dispute between the Hardoons' adopted children erupted after Liza's death in 1941, and ended with a settlement reached between the children in 1946. However, Ezra Salch Hardoon, who represented the other Iraqi relatives, continued to petition the Chinese courts both before and after the Communist take-over in 1949. In 1956, the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court ruled that, because Liza had accumulated large outstanding debts, the entirety of Hardoon's estate would be secured by the court. In June 1957, the court terminated the Hardoon inheritance case and Ezra Salch Hardoon finally departed Shanghai for Iraq.

The eldest son and heir of Harry Grey, 4th Earl of Stamford by his wife Lady Mary, only daughter and heiress of George Booth, 2nd Earl of Warrington, baptised on 21 October at Newtown Linford, Leicestershire. Educated at Leicester School he went up to Queens' College, Cambridge. where he matriculated in the Michaelmas term 1755, graduating MA in 1758. Lord Grey served as Whig MP for Staffordshire from 1761 until 1768. On 22 September he was a Page of Honour at George III's coronation. Colonel of the Royal Chester Regiment of Militia from 1764, and Lord Lieutenant from 1783. The Grey family owned large tracts of land at Enville in Staffordshire and Bradgate Park in Leicestershire, and his mother had inherited Dunham Massey Hall and land in Stalybridge. His father died in 1768 and his mother in 1772. He was created on 22 April 1796 the Baron Delamer of Dunham Massey, in the County of Chester, and Earl of Warrington. On 28 May 1763, he married Lady Henrietta, second daughter of William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland and the art collector Margaret Bentinck, Duchess of Portland, only daughter and heiress of Robert, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Mortimer at Stamford House, Whitehall, and registry office, Westminster, having nine children including: * Lady Henrietta (1764-1826), married John Chetwode * George Grey, 6th Earl of Stamford (1765-1845), his successor in the family titles * Lady Marie Booth Grey (1767-1767) * Lady Maria (1769-1838), married John Cotes MPwww.historyofparliamentonline.org * Lady Louisa Booth Grey (1771-1830) * William Booth Grey (1773-1852)www.britishmuseum.org * Anchitel Grey, a prebendary (1774-1833) * Henry Grey, a naval commander (1776-1799) * Lady Sophia (1777-1849), married her cousin, Booth Grey, of Ashton Hayes * Lady Amelia (1779-1849), married John Lister Kaye He succeeded to his father's earldom in 1768. His brother-in-law, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, while Prime Minister,www.nottingham.ac.uk suggested that Stamford should also become a peer of Great Britain in addition to being an English peer. He accepted an earldom in 1796 from Portland's successor William Pitt the Younger, rather than the reported previous offer of a marquessate; in the absence of there being another dukedom in keeping with Grey family tradition (cf Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk), Stamford deemed it better to preserve the memory of his grandmaternal family whose estates he had inherited. Thus he received the additional titles of Baron Delamer and Earl of Warrington (in the peerage of Great Britain) in recognition of the Booth family. He modernised the family's Staffordshire seat at Enville to the design of Thomas Hope. He promoted the development of the town of Ashton-under-Lyne (where he had appointed his cousin, George Booth as Rector) near Manchester, on land inherited from the Earls of Warrington.Enville and stalybridge estates On his death at Enville Hall on 23 May 1819 he was succeeded by his eldest son, after his will was proven became 6th Earl of Stamford and 2nd Earl of Warrington.

The program was administered by Industry Canada. History of CAP In 1994 the Community Access Program began. Initially, Industry Canada focused on rural communities, where Internet access was less available. Once the rural communities were equipped with computers and Internet access, Industry Canada focused on what is referred to as the digital divide. According to Statistics Canada 2001, the following groups were in highest need of services offered by CAP: Aboriginals, older Canadians, Canadians with low income or low education, francophone, new immigrants, and people in rural areas. Therefore, the focus was primarily to assist in 'Bridging the Digital Divide'. CAP Sites in rural and urban areas were then opened to help reach these people. The program played a crucial role in bridging the Digital Divide; contributing to the foundation for electronic access to government services; encouraging online learning and literacy; fostering the development of community based infrastructure; promoting Canadian e-commerce; and providing training with Assistive Technology. In order to make better use of the computers and equipment funded by CAP, Industry Canada also initiated the Community Access Program - Youth Initiative (CAP YI). CAP Sites could apply for funding to hire Youth Interns to come and work in their CAP Sites to train the public in computer and Internet use and technology. The CAP program was terminated on March 31, 2012 as funding for the program was not renewed. Industry Canada stated that the program had reached its objective, and cited challenging fiscal times. Some provinces maintained their program thanks to large financial contributions from the provincial government, municipalities and libraries. The CAP YI (Youth Initiative) program continues to receive funding. Industry Canada Logo CAP YI The Community Access Program (CAP) Youth Initiative (YI) was coordinated by Industry Canada's Community Access Program and funded through the Youth Employment Strategy (YES) of Canada -- overseen by Human Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC). CAP's youth initiative aimed to provide employment opportunities for young Canadians between the ages of 15 and 30 - primarily students, recent graduates, or the under-employed or unemployed. Locations Industry Canada's Community Access Program (CAP) gave thousands of Canadians affordable access to the Internet. CAP sites were located in public locations such as schools, community centers, and libraries. They provided access in locations that are geographically remote (e.g. on parts of Cape Breton Island ) or served populations subject to the digital divide. Sites were established and maintained by community networks, generally in partnership with Municipal and Provincial Governments. There were CAP sites located in all of the provinces and territories of Canada.

She was also a writer and, beginning in 1987, was an associate editor for the magazine Art Papers in Atlanta, Georgia.Perry, Pam (1987), \\"The ear and the eye meet in the work of Mildred Thompson\\", Creative Loafing, Section 6B, October 3, 1987.

Perry, Pam (1987).) and Thompson's readings in astronomy, spiritualism and metaphysicsStaff writer ‚ÄúE.P.‚Äù, Essence, May 1990, p. 86. as important artistic influences.  Early studies  Thompson grew up in Jacksonville, Florida. Her formal art training began in 1953 when she entered Howard University in Washington, D.C. There she found a mentor in James A. Porter (1905‚Äì1970), who was head of the school's art department. He arranged for Thompson to receive a scholarship at the end of her junior year for summer study at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. After Thompson received the Bachelor of Arts from Howard, Porter assisted her in entering the Brooklyn Museum of Art School on a Max Beckmann Scholarship. She began to exhibit, and her work was accepted for the Art U.S.A. ‚Äô58 exhibition in Madison Square Garden.Thompson, M. (1977), \\"Mildred Thompson, Sculptor: Experiences of a Black Artist in Europe and the United States\\", p. 20, James A. Porter Gallery of Art, Howard University, Washington, DC. During that time Thompson applied and was turned down for a Fulbright Scholarship. Feeling herself ready for study in Europe, Thompson decided to go there on her own. She worked to save money during the rest of the school year and, through the auspices of Samella Lewis (1924‚Äì), got a summer job teaching ceramics at Florida A&M; University in Tallahassee. In this way she earned enough for steamship passage to Europe.Thompson (1977), p. 24.  Study in Europe  Her trip to Germany was attended by good fortune. She had decided to study at the Art Academy of Hamburg (Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste Hamburg) even though, at the time she arrived, she had not yet applied or been accepted there. Nor did she have any plans as to where she would live. A few private lessons were all she had to prepare herself for the German language. Nevertheless, armed with pluck, a strong portfolio and the help of some brand-new German friends, she found a room and was immediately accepted into the Academy. There her painting teachers were Walter Arno (1930‚Äì) and Emil Schumacher (1912‚Äì1999). She learned etching, lithography and other printmaking media from Willem Grimm (1904‚Äì1986) and Paul Wunderlich (1927‚Äì2010). She also met at this time the printmaker Horst Janssen (1929‚Äì1995), who introduced her to Galerie Sander in Hamburg, where Thompson had her first solo exhibition. At the end of her first year she received a scholarship, the Reemtsma Stipendium, that paid for her living and school expenses.Thompson (1977) pp. 24‚Äì25.  An American expatriate  After three years at the Academy, Thompson was ready to begin her professional career in the United States. In early 1961 she returned to New York City. The social and artistic acceptance Thompson had enjoyed in Germany, however, was not to be found even in that most cosmopolitan of American cities. She soon realized that because she was a black woman, she was refused the shows and gallery representation that she felt her work deserved. In an autobiographical essay, Thompson recounted that \\"One woman dealer... said that it would be impossible for me to have a show in New York as an artist. [Another gallery owner said] ...that it would be better if I had a white friend to take my work around, someone to pass as Mildred Thompson.\\"Thompson (1977), p. 28. She did, however, gain an audience with William LiebermanThe son of German Expressionist artist Max Liebermann, William Lieberman (1923‚Äì2005) was an influential curator at the Museum of Modern Art from 1945 to 1979 and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1979 to 2004. at the Museum of Modern Art; two of her prints were purchased for the collection on his recommendation.Thompson (1977), p. 28. One of the prints, \\"Love for Sale\\" (1959), was reproduced in the book Fille de Joie, Grove Press, 1967. In the fall of 1961 and again in 1962 Thompson received fellowships to the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire, where she worked on drawings and paintings. In 1963 she returned to Germany to live, partly because she could find no sales outlet for her work, and partly because of growing racial tension in the United States. She was not alone. Other young black artists who chose to leave the U.S. during the 1950s and 1960s include Harvey Cropper, Herbert Gentry, Arthur Hardie, Clifford Jackson, Sam Middleton, Earl Miller, Norman Morgan, Larry Potter and Walter Williams. In the words of artist David Driskell, \\"They chose a form of cultural exile over expatriation, hoping for a better day to come about in the land of their birth.\\"Driskell, David C. (1978), \\"Bibliographies in Afro-American Art\\", American Art Quarterly, Vol. 30, No. 3, 1978, p. 385. All settled in Europe. Thompson established herself in the Rhineland town of D√ºren and once again began exhibiting and selling her work there and in the German cities of Bensberg, Aachen, and Cologne. Thompson's work in the 1960s was figurative, but in the early 1970s she moved toward total abstraction. In Europe her works reflected the formal ideas of art for art's sake, and did not respond to the politicized art of the Black and Women's movements in the United States. According to writer Alexis De Veaux, \\"Thompson thought of herself as an expatriate and did not separate her identity as black from her identity as American...\\" although she eventually disavowed \\"...any claim to being American.\\"De Veaux, Alexis (2006), Warrior Poet: A Biography of Audre Lorde, W.W. Norton & Co., p. 175. Years later Thompson defended herself against the charge that because of her years spent in Europe, she was not a \\"Black\\" artist. In a 1987 essay for SAGE magazine she wrote: > \\"On certain levels, perhaps we [black Americans] might be able to identify > with certain parts of certain African cultures. To copy symbols that one > does not understand, to deliberately make use of a form that one does not > know how to analyze or appreciate was for me the height of prostitution. I > had spent long years trying to find out who I am and what my influences were > and where they came from. It was perhaps because I had lived and studied > with \\"whitey\\" that I had learned to appreciate my Blackness as well as how > American I truly am. My experiences throughout Africa had made my knowledge > of being an American more than clear. There are recordings in our genes that > remember Africa. If they are strong enough and we are free of false denials, > they will surface and appear without deliberation no matter what we > do.\\"Thompson, Mildred, \\"Memoirs of an Artist\\", SAGE: A Scholarly Journal on > Black Women, Vol. IV, No.1 (Spring 1987), pp. 42‚Äì43. After ten years in Germany (during which she traveled to southern Europe and Africa) Thompson returned to the U.S. in 1975. She found that the social climate had changed somewhat for the better, and she was able to overcome many of the obstacles she encountered. She lived at first in Florida, where she was named Artist-in-Residence of the City of Tampa.Thompson (1977), p. 31. In 1977 she moved to Washington, D.C., where she was Artist-in-Residence at Howard University for the 1977‚Äì78 academic year. She returned to Europe in 1981, this time to Paris, where she opened a studio in the Rue de Parme. Thompson moved to Atlanta in 1986, which was \\"home base\\" for the remainder of her life. There she taught art and art history in several area colleges, including the Atlanta College of Art.Irlbeck, A. (2001), \\"Artist, teacher, musician to speak on Warhol exhibit\\", Lubbock Online.com, Wednesday, January 17, 2001. Accessed May 23, 2008. A talented writer and interviewer, she joined the staff of the periodical Art Papers in 1987.  Influences in Thompson‚Äôs mature work  In 1987 Thompson's show In and Out of Germany, at the Goethe Institute in Atlanta, contained 42 artworks executed in Germany, France and the United States. The Atlanta newsweekly Creative Loafing mentioned that Thompson's most recent series of colored pencil drawings, \\"Objective Music\\", were based on her correlation of art with music. It also made reference to her sense of color and rhythmic line-making as \\"Kandinsky-influenced.\\"Perry, 1987. A contemporary review of the exhibition in Art Papers also mentioned Kandinsky as an influence for Thompson, as well as the artist's interest in the fiction of Hermann Hesse and the Jungian concept of the collective unconscious. But Thompson's feeling for music seemed to have the strongest effect on the work in the exhibition. The reviewer, Leslie Schworm, wrote that Thompson's \\"‚Ä¶approach is to draw music or sound. She believes that patterns in music are among the purest natural recurrences, providing direct access to something basic.\\".Schworm, L. (1988), \\"Mildred Thompson, Goethe Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, September 11‚ÄìOctober 17\\", p. 59, Art Papers, January/February 1988. In the following year the visual description of music was still on Thompson's mind. A solo exhibition titled Concatenation at Agnes Scott College contained the wooden sculpture Mass, whose six parts were named \\"Kyrie\\", \\"Gloria\\", \\"Credo\\", \\"Sanctus\\", \\"Benedictus\\", and \\"Gloria Dei\\".Gay-Griffin, L. (1989), \\"Exhibit explores depth of spirit\\", p. 16D, Daily News, Lawrenceville, Georgia, Saturday, November 25, 1989. But other influences, including astronomy, spiritualism and metaphysics were starting to appear in her work. Included in Concatenations was a series of prints titled Five Mysteries. Their abstract compositions, printed in black ink on white paper, were schematic representations of earth, atmosphere and sun, the latter a flat disc set in a sky filled with energetic marks and scratches. Thompson's series of watercolors, titled Lemurian Wanderings, were described by critic Lorena Gay- Griffin as ‚Äú‚Ä¶the time at the dawn of the world before the first ray of sun shone through the atmosphere.\\"Gay-Griffin (1989). A series of colored pencil drawings, The Phases of Cynthia, was reported by the same writer to refer to Galileo‚Äôs study of the phases of the moon. The drawings featured \\"...the same sun/moon image as the prints. The circles are layered with other geometric shapes and surrounded by fragments and rays emitting from the center.\\" In 1990 Thompson told Essence magazine: \\"My work has to do with the cosmos and how it affects us.\\"Essence (1990). Such references continued in her printmaking. In 1993, as an artist-in-residence at Littleton Studios in North Carolina, Thompson created prints in vitreography titled Helio Centric, Particles and Wave Function. A 1992 group exhibition entitled A/Cross Currents: Synthesis in African American Abstract Painting featured a catalog that cited the jazz of Eric Dolphy, Charles Mingus and Thelonious Monk and the German baroque of Bach as influences on Thomspon's art. The catalog's essayist, Corrine Jennings, wrote: \\"The idea that man and certain animals can hear the sounds of eleven or twelve octaves, but can only see one octave of seven colors, has led to [Thompson‚Äôs] interest in exploring the unseen and making it visible.\\"Jennings (1992). The Magnetic Fields series of paintings that Thompson exhibited in the show, Jennings wrote, \\"‚Ä¶appear to visualize the force of unseen energy. They are intensely painted, tersely defined geometric structures with a direct physical application loosened by‚Ä¶improvisation.\\"  Teaching  Thompson had a long and varied teaching career. From 1961 to 1964, when she was trying to make her way as an artist in New York City, she taught elementary school as an employee of the New York Board of Education. In D√ºren, Germany, she taught art and art history at the Eschweiler Volchoch Schule from 1965 to 1974. On being named Artist-in Residence for the City of TampaThe residency was awarded by the Florida State Arts Council with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. Thompson taught classes and workshops in painting, drawing, sculpture, and mural painting to adults and children at the Tampa Bay Art Center and other local venues. She also had an \\"open door\\" policy at her studio on 7th Avenue in Ybor City. There, she wrote: \\"...anyone who wanted to come in and see could walk in. I felt it somehow served the community.\\"Thompson, M. (1987), \\"Memoirs of an Artist, p. 42, SAGE: A Scholarly Journal on Black Women, 10/1:42. As an Artist-in-Residence at Howard University she taught etching. When she lived in Paris, Thompson gave private lessons at her studio at 4 Rue de Parme from 1981 until her return to the States in 1985. From 1986 to 1989 she taught studio classes, art history and art theory at Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, and in Atlanta she taught at Morehouse College and Spelman College. From 1986 she taught at the Atlanta College of Art.1993 resume for Mildred Thompson.

Life Anton Adner was born in 1705, either in Sch√∂nau - where his residence was - or in the Tyrol, from whence Adner would have come after the birth of his child. Adner's nickname was Danei. Selling wooden boxes Grave marker of Anton Adner Until the end of his life, Adner's modest artisan activity consisted of building and selling his wooden creations. In those years, the region of Berchtesgaden had strict commerce regulations. Carpenters were allowed only one specialized item to build to sell, so Adner specialized in making wooden boxes of many uses, basically decorative for storing basic necessities such as foodstuffs, valuables, toys, etc. Berchtesgaden also imposed import/export fees for those goods which crossed the Bohemian border. However, the artisan could carry his wares by foot without paying a tax, so therefore - like many other artisans of his time - Adner chose to transport his goods by foot with a backpack far beyond Berchtesgadener land, trekking throughout Bavaria and farther into Austria and Switzerland. The wooden boxes were carried by Adner, over his shoulder and even over his head. He continued this activity long after he had reached his 100th birthday. For a pastime, Anton Adner would also knit artisan socks, to supplement his income along with his wooden boxes. National fame Bavarian royalty had spotted Anton Adner for the inauguration of a brine device at Berchtesgaden. Then Adner was presented in 1814 at the Frauenkirche cathedral of Munich for Maundy Thursday, as the oldest man in Bavaria. For the occasion, Adner participated in the rite of foot washing and attended a theatre for the first time in his life. During the event, Adner, who then claimed to be 110 years old, also managed to climb the 92-meter-high southern tower of the cathedral. A portrait, the Frauenturm (Lady's Tower), was engraved to commemorate the deed, but it was destroyed during a World War II bombing raid. Nonetheless, Munich-based painter Kleiber did a painting of it, which hangs in the museum of Berchtesgaden. In 1817, at the alleged age of 112, Anton Adner met Emperor Maximilian I who supported his medical care.

Their objective was to eliminate the presence of Taliban insurgents who had regrouped in the area in the aftermath of Operation Harekate Yolo in late 2007. It was the second time in half a year that Norwegian and German ISAF forces had participated in a major offensive in the restless Badghis province in western Afghanistan. It was also the first time that the professional soldiers of the Telemark Battalion had participated in actual combat. The name of the operation derives from the Afghan word for kareez, which is a water management system used to provide a reliable supply of water to human settlements and irrigation in hot, arid and semi-arid climates. Background In the aftermath of the tactical victory by the ISAF forces in Operation Harekate Yolo in October‚ÄìNovember 2007, the Taliban insurgents fled to the mountainous border regions of Afghanistan and Turkmenistan. However, the goal of the operation was not realized, as various aid organisations could not enter the poor Badghis province. This, along with a lack of control of the region by the Afghan government, gave the Taliban insurgents an opportunity to establish a stronghold there.Norwegian State TV NRK1: \\"Dagsrevyen\\" News rapport May 26th 2008 As a result, the National Joint Headquarters (Fellesoperativt Hovedkvarter - FOHK) prepared elements of the Telemark Battalion, which makes up the Norwegian Quick Response Force (QRF) with its base Mazar-e Sharif in northern Afghanistan, to create better security for the central government in the area, which would make it possible for the aid organisations to enter Badghis province and provide assistance for its poor population.VG Newspaper: Norsk offensiv i Afghanistan - Minst 13 Taliban-soldater drept i harde kamper The operation The long planned operation was initiated on May 13 and lasted for ten days.Forsvarsnett: ‚Äì Dette vi har trent p√• By the twilight of the first day of the operation, the 250 Norwegian soldiers had encamped next to the village of Kor-i Karez, all according to plan. Suddenly the Norwegian soldiers came under fire from Taliban insurgents armed with rifles, machine guns and rocket propelled grenades. The Taliban insurgents attacked from a distance of around 1200 metres, in what Major Rune Wenneberg described as a \\"well coordinated assault\\" against the soldiers of Telemark Battalion. While initially surprising the Norwegian ISAF soldiers, they quickly took control of the situation, and supported by CV 9030 armoured vehicles and mortars, the soldiers of the Telemark Battalion were able to successfully repel the Taliban assault. The exchange of fire dropped in intensity after the Norwegian soldiers used heavy weaponry against the insurgents, and after a couple of hours the Taliban insurgents had fled the scene.Telemark Battalion in new combat with Taliban , Aftenposten, 27 May 2008 The Commander of the QRF, Lt. Col. Kjell Inge B√¶kken was proud of the professionalism and the calmness the Norwegian soldiers showed during the whole clash, further stating that they had trained long for military operations such as these.Forsvarsnett: ‚Äì Norske styrker i kamper The participating soldiers also commented that the training they got at home was important for their success in the operation. On May 14 and May 16 the soldiers of the Telemark Battalion engaged the Taliban insurgents in two further confrontations from a safe distance, again supported by CV 9030 armoured vehicles, mortars and NATO close air support, as well as by Afghan security forces.Aftenposten Newspaper: Taliban-soldater drept av norske styrker Aftenposten Newspaper: Lenge til neste norske offensiv i Afghanistan Norwegians out of the fray, Aftenposten, 29 May 2008 United States participation Along with 35 ETT and a PSD from ARSIC-N, US forces embedded with and supported Afghan commandos from May 17‚Äì19 participating in Afghan air assaults. These air assaults were conducted in Russian MI-16 helicopters to create a solid cordon while Norwegians pushed through forcing enemy combatants right into the cordon where they were stripped of any firearms and detained or engaged at times. The U.S. soldiers on these air assaults made history as the air assaults were a historic first for Afghan Airforce pilots and loadmasters. German participation The circumstances of the participation of the German soldiers in the operation is disputed. Whilst German sources stated that they were participating in Operation Karez in northern Afghanistan in conjunction with the Afghan army and the Norwegian QRF, the German magazine Der Spiegel stated that the German government hesitated to deploy the reconnaissance, logistics and KSK forces originally promised by the German regional commander. The reason given was that the area of operation, which is in Ghormach district, lay exactly on the border with the area under Italian command. For domestic political reasons, the German government is very intent on only deploying ISAF soldiers to RC North and Kabul, which are covered by the mandate from parliament, even if this interferes with operational realities. It was only on May 17 that the German Minister of defense, Franz Josef Jung, decided to approve the German participation in the operation. At that point, the Norwegian and Afghan forces active in the engagement had already been fighting the Taliban for a week.Spiegel Online: Not Licensed to Kill: German Special Forces in Afghanistan Let Taliban Commander Escape The National Joint Headquarters would neither confirm or deny the information in the Spiegel article.Aftenposten Newspaper: Tyske soldater holdt tilbake Aftermath On May 23 the ISAF-led operations concluded with no casualties among the ISAF soldiers nor the Afghan security forces. The Norwegian soldiers and officers received very good response from NATO for their successful use of NATO tactics in combat, which focuses on the deliberate strategy of avoiding casualties and using heavy weaponry over long distances. According to the official spokesperson of the National Joint Headquarters, Lt. Col. John Inge √ògl√¶nd, it was one of the largest operations Norwegian soldiers have carried out in this part of Afghanistan, the size of the operation in November last year in which about 50 people were killed.Dagbladet Newspaper: - Vi har drept 13 personer The given numbers of Taliban insurgent casualties in the operation vary, but were estimated between 13 and 15 killed in action. According to the Commander of the QRF, Lt. Col. Kjell Inge B√¶kken, there were no reports of civilians casualties in the operation.

Founded in 1984 by the North Carolina General Assembly, it was the first state-sponsored biotechnology initiative in the United States, merging the interests of the academic private and public sectors.North Carolina Governor's Office Press Release, Hunt Announces Establishment of Biotechnology Center as Independent Corporation, December 12, 1984. The North Carolina Biotechnology Center's mission is to provide long-term economic and societal benefits to North Carolina through support of biotechnology research, business, education and strategic policy. It receives nearly all of its funding from the North Carolina General Assembly. Since 1984, the North Carolina Biotechnology Center has invested more than $187 million in state monies to develop biotechnology statewide. It is not a site for laboratory research or company incubation, but it works to strengthen the research capabilities of North Carolina's companies and universities. Locations The permanent headquarters of the North Carolina Biotechnology Center in Research Triangle Park is a hub for work, learning, and interaction. The buildings encompass and is divided into three main parts: *A program-management center housing about 70 staff members; *A full-service biotechnology library, open to the public; and *The Hamner Conference Center. In addition to its Research Triangle Park headquarters, the Center has five regional offices across the state: *Eastern North Carolina (Greenville) *Greater Charlotte (Charlotte) *Piedmont Triad (Winston-Salem) *Southeastern North Carolina (Wilmington) *Western North Carolina (Asheville) Goals The North Carolina Biotechnology Center works toward six goals: # Strengthen North Carolina's academic and industrial biotechnology research capabilities. # Foster North Carolina's biotechnology industrial development. # Work with business, government and academia to move biotechnology from research to commercialization in North Carolina. # Inform North Carolinians about the science, applications, benefits and issues of biotechnology. # Enhance the teaching and workforce-training capabilities of North Carolina's educational institutions. # Establish North Carolina as a preeminent international location for the biotechnology industry.  History  In 1981, the North Carolina Biotechnology Center was created by the North Carolina General Assembly.Link, Albery N. From Seed to Harvest: The Growth of the Research Triangle Park. Research Triangle Park: Research Triangle Foundation of America. (2002): 99-102. At that time, the state's General Assembly appointed a legislative study commission to determine how North Carolina could ensure long-term economic benefits from biotechnology. A yearlong study by the commission concluded that North Carolina needed a private, non-profit organization dedicated exclusively to biotechnology development. Following that recommendation, state legislatures established the North Carolina Biotechnology Center in October 1984 as the world's first government-sponsored biotechnology center. The first president of the N.C. Biotechnology Center was Leon Golberg, previously head of the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology in RTP.Basinger, Randy. \\"Biotechnology: 'New' Science Growing in the Park.\\" North Carolina Beacon, 13 Jan. 1994: 7  References   External links  * Category:Organizations based in North Carolina Category:Research institutes in the United States ","title":"North Carolina Biotechnology Center"},{"id":"17643755","text":"Bompiani is an Italian publishing house based in Milan. It was founded in 1929 by Valentino Bompiani. In 1990, Bompiani became part of the RCS MediaGroup. It was sold in 2015 to the Giunti Group. It is widely regarded as one of the leading literary publishing houses in Italy.  History  Libero Bigiaretti with the publisher Valentino Bompiani (right). Bompiani experienced attempts at book censorship by Italy's fascist government from the 1920s through the 1940s. In 1940, Valentino Bompiani was summoned to Rome to meet with Alessandro Pavolini, the Minister of Popular Culture. At this meeting, Pavolini told Bompiani that he must limit the number of translations that he was publishing. At the time of the meeting, Bompiani was preparing to publish an anthology of American writers. Despite being told not to do so, Bompiani moved forward with the anthology. Pavolini learned of this and wrote to Bompiani that \\"The United States is a potential enemy of ours...This is no time to perform acts of courtesy toward America, not even literary ones.\\" Bompiani proceeded with publication nonetheless, soliciting a new introduction from Emilio Cecchi that sought to discourage any \\"excessive enthusiasm\\" toward America. Pavolini was placated by Cecchi's introduction and the anthology was ultimately published. In 1972 the company was bought by Fiat Group. In 1990 it became part of RCS MediaGroup. In October 2015, RCS MediaGroup sold RCS Libri, including Bompiani, to Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, Italy's largest publisher. Mondadori is owned by Fininvest, a holding company controlled by Silvio Berlusconi. The acquisition was controversial. In March 2016, Italian Competition Authority ruled that Mondadori must sell Bompiani in order to comply with market-share limits. Nine companies, including Amazon and HarperCollins, expressed interest in purchasing Bompiani. In September 2016, Bompiani was sold to Giunti Editore for ‚Ç¨16.5 million.

The social justice law firm Rush, Crane, Guenther, provides legal counsel. Government recognition In 1998, CAERS received the BC Eliminates Racism Together Award from the Ministry of Multiculturalism for research that led to exposing the head of the Ku Klux Klan in British Columbia and organizing against hate. In 2001, CAERS received an award from the Ministry of Multiculturalism and Immigration for organizing provincial consultations for the United Nations World Conference Against Racism.

Lobbying initiatives Five foreign trained medical doctors began a hunger strike in 1990 to draw attention to discrimination in the allocation of medical internships in the province of British Columbia, Canada.Medical Internships In response to a request from the doctors, CAERS and other representatives met with Bill Vander Zalm, then Premier of the province, and John Jensen, then Minister of Health, to demand that the Ministry of Health and the College of Physicians and Surgeons provide equal access for immigrant doctors to internship programs. A report on the demands was written.Bitonti et al. (1990) Systemic Discrimination Against Foreign Trained Doctors in British Columbia Meetings were also arranged with the College of Physicians and Surgeons and political opposition parties. Failing to achieve equal access, a complaint was made to the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal alleging discrimination in the allocation of internships by the BC Ministry of Health, the College of Physicians and Surgeons and Hospitals.Bitonti v. British Columbia (Ministry of Health No. 3) [BCHRT (1999), 36 CHRR D/263] In 1999, the tribunal ruled that foreign trained doctors were discriminated against by the College based on place of origin, but that Hospitals and the BC Ministry of Health had not discriminated. In 1990, CAERS was invited to address the House of Commons legislative committee on proposed legislation to create the Canadian Race Relations Foundation (CRRF) as part of a reparations settlement for the internment of Japanese-Canadians during World War II.Canadian Race Relations Foundation CAERS' submission was that the name of the CRRF was inappropriate and should not reflect popular misconceptions about the biological significance of the concept of \\"race\\" in socio-economic relations. CAERS also argued that careful measures were needed to ensure that the Foundation would be at arm's length from Government and that it should be a national voice on anti-racism to aid and support NGOs in the development of sustainable anti-racism initiatives. In 1990, CAERS was requested to administer funding from the Canadian Labour Force Development Board to establish a national visible minority reference group for labour force development. The National Visible Minority (NVMC) arose from that funding. The growth of hate groups and the widespread distribution of hate propaganda throughout North America, particularly in the early 1990s, led CAERS to lobby the Government of Canada to strengthen and broaden hate crime legislation, improve policing and lobby the various Attorneys General in each province to lay charges under the Criminal Code since the consent of the AG is a required before charges under the Criminal Code of Canada for the production and distribution of hate propaganda and advocating genocide can be laid.Criminal Code No charges had been made to then for the production or distribution of hate propaganda under the Criminal Code. To assess the degree of the problem and proposed solutions, CAERS convened an international conference on racism, hate crime and the law funded by the province of British Columbia.Dutton, A. (Editor) Racism, Hate Crime & the Law, 1995 In response to a request from the Department of Justice, CAERS prepared a report on the production and distribution of hate material by white supremacist organizations.Dutton, A. & C. Cornish, Hate Propaganda: the Law Reform Division and Research and Statistics Section, Department of Justice, 1995 Based on the recommendations of the Racism, Hate Crime and the Law conference and the report prepared for the Department of Justice, CAERS began lobbying the Attorney General of BC to establish a dedicated policing unit focusing on hate crime. The first hate crime unit in Canada was soon formed with representation from various police forces in the province and the Community Liaison Branch of the Ministry of the Attorney General and in 1998 the Attorney General of BC gave CAERS an award for exposing the head of the KKK and for providing public education on how to stop the spread of racism.Local Anti-racist Organization Exposes Head of the Klan. Surrey Now, 1998The Province However, no charges were laid against the Klan under the Criminal Code. In 1997, CAERS warned that the Heritage Front and Odin's Law were establishing themselves in Surrey and in Vancouver's Eastend and that violence would ensue.Brace for hate, Surrey warned.

The controversy about the responsible use of tax-payer supported institutions versus free speech generated a great deal of debate and a number of important motions by various city councils to develop acceptable use policy for publicly funded institutions.City bars likely hatemongers from publicly owned facilities, Times Colonist: November 8, 1996. A complaint to the Ombudsman of BC resulted in the recommendation that libraries in BC issue a written statement of acceptable use regarding meeting room rental much like the acceptable use policy governing computer use and sexually explicit images and that persons using libraries comply with all federal, provincial and municipal legislation and regulations.Ombudsman Special Report No. 23 March 2003 The Library board chair called the Ombudsman's recommendations ludicrous.Controversy haunts library board, Times Colonist, April 4, 2003 In response to a request from the Ministry of Community, Aboriginal and Women's Services (MCAW) in 2004, Alan Dutton represented CAERS on a steering committee to establish a strategic direction on anti-racism and multiculturalism for British Columbia. The committee developed a \\"Blueprint for Change\\" document that was to guide ministry programs and activities for the next three to five years. Despite the representation by CAERS and other NGOs, the Government of BC ignored the major recommendations of the committee and began to isolate itself from grass roots organizations and NGOs in favour of five or six large immigrant settlement agencies in the province and to develop a Safe Harbour program without teeth, accountability or grass-roots community support. CAERS viewed the program as a fundamental shift from anti-racism to symbolic multiculturalism. In 2007, the Department of Justice Canada conducted a national study to develop recommendations to better respond to hate on the Net, or cyber hate.Slane, A. Combatting Hate on the Net: Current Canadian Efforts and the Recommendations of Non-Governmental Organizations to Improve upon Them, Department of Justice. December 2007 A national conference was held in Toronto to examine the recommendations from the study. CAERS lobbied against one national hot line because of competing interests and definitions and for support of community hot lines and proactive measures to counter-act cyber hate and the recruitment of youth into extremist groups. Community initiatives CAERS has been instrumental in building community coalitions to expose and oppose racism across Canada. In 1992, CAERS helped form a coalition to boycott Japanese Air Lines (JAL) for alleged discriminatory seating and stop-over policy in Japan. An employee of Canadian Airlines, the booking agent for JAL, revealed a written policy that ordered JAL attendants to seat Delhi-bound passengers at the back of the plane.Province, March 26, 1992 It was also alleged that hotel reservations for stopovers in Japan were discriminatory since Delhi-bound passengers were allocated basement accommodation. JAL denied that the seating and reservation policy were discriminatory. JAL agreed that there would be no seating and stop-over reservations without the consent of passengers. In 1992, CAERS held a media conference and a rally to stop Tom Metzger of the California-based White Aryan Resistance Movement (WAR) from organizing in B.C. Over 3,000 attended the anti-racist rally at the Vancouver Art Gallery in downtown Vancouver. The local organizer for WAR was Tony McAleer, who had been found to have contravened section 13 of the CHRC that prohibits the dissemination of messages likely to expose groups to hatred by telephoneMcAleer v. Canada (Human Rights Comm.) (1996), 26 C.H.R.R. D/280 (F.C.T.D.) [Eng./Fr. 15 pp.]: exposure to hatred on the basis of sexual orientation - Tribunal decision upheld in hate messages case and who was later jailed for contempt when he circumvented the CHRC decision by establishing a telephone message system in Washington State. In the early 1990s, a local newspaper in the suburbs of Vancouver, the North Shore News, began to regularly publish articles suggesting that immigrants from Iran were taking over Canada, were responsible for crime and that the Holocaust did not occur. Authorities cited for these claims were Ernst Z√ºndel and a number of European Holocaust deniers, including David Irving. CAERS organized demonstrations to denounce the publisher and newspaper. Two human rights complaints were subsequently filed under the BC Human Rights Code against the editor and the writer, Doug Collins. The first, by the Canadian Jewish Congress, failed but the second, by a private small businessman, succeeded and the newspaper was fined and forced to print an apology. News of Charles ScottDecision regarding Chilliwack Anti-racism Society v. Charles Scott and the Church of Jesus Christ in Israel recruiting in the armed forces and schools in several smaller communities in BC broke in 1995. Scott was the Canadian leader of the racist Church of Christ in Israel. In response, CAERS worked with several groups, including Salmon Arm Coalition Against Racism and local Mayors to organize public events in each of the local communities Charles Scott had set up the group, including Abbotsford, Kelowna, Creston and Yahk. Radio station CKST broadcast a series of interviews in 1995 with Holocaust denier David Irving, Doug Collins and leader of Aryan Nations in Canada, Charles Scott, Chilliwack Anti-racism Society v. Charles Scott and the Church of Jesus Christ in Israel CAERS gave interviews to several newspapers complaining that the radio station was providing a forum for racists. Radio station AM 1040 retaliated by suing CAERS and Alan Dutton for libel. Of the two newspapers that carried interviews with Dutton, only the Western Jewish Tribune was included in the libel suit. The issue was resolved when AM 1040 dropped the libel suit and paid legal costs. In 1998, when Nirmal Sign Gill, a caretaker at the Guru Nanak Temple in Surrey, B.C., was kicked to death by five racist skinheads, CAERS participated in an anti-racist coalition to organize a mass community march and rally. The skinheads charged in the murder of care caretaker were caught by police surveillance planning to kill many more at the Temple. The call for a mass rally was opposed by several groups and by Surrey City Council that feared that the march and rally would end in violence. To fan the fears, the Vancouver Sun reported that the neo-Nazi Heritage Front was organizing a counter-demonstration. In July 1999 more than 3,000 men, women and children peacefully marched to Bear Creek Park to hear speeches and listen to music commemorating the death of Mr. Gill. The Surrey RAMP detachment supplied over 50 uniformed police officers for traffic control and security. In response to requests from employees at a Surrey telephone call-in centre, CAERS organized a series of community meetings concerning employment and human rights. The BC Government Employees Union had mounted a campaign to organize the employees and several had complained of retaliation from the employer. CAERS represented several employees at mediation hearings before the BC Human Rights Tribunal and Employment Insurance and won major settlements.  Educational Initiatives  CAERS received support from the National Film Board of Canada, the Department of Canadian Heritage, the government of British Columbia] and Knowledge Network to interview leaders and present and former members of racist groups to produce educational resources on the recruitment and recovery of youth from racist groups. Video-taped interviews were conducted with Ernst Z√ºndel, Charles Scott, Christopher Brodsky, Dan Sims, Kerry Noble, and Johnny Lee Carey. In 1999, five hate crime conferences for aboriginal communities in the province were funded in 1998 Kelly A. MacDonald, Aboriginal Hate Crime Forums November 1999 Multiculturalism BC and CAERS was tasked with presenting research on hate groups affecting Aboriginal Communities in each of the regional conferences. Following a number of incidents in Correctional facilities in 1998, CAERS was tasked by Corrections Canada to develop a manual on racist symbols, to develop educational materials for Corrections staff, to deliver workshop for staff and to hold meetings with inmates on issues related to racism within Corrections. In 1999, the United Nations proposed a world conference on racism and discrimination to be held in Durban South Africa and several regional preparatory conferences were held throughout the world. CAERS was a delegate of the Government of Canada to the European prep-conference held in Strasbourg, France, and was funded to attend the main conference in Durban. In Canada, CAERS was commissioned to organize regional preparatory conferences for the WCAR by the BC Government. In 2001 the Ministry Of Multiculturalism And Immigration recognized CAERS with an award for community leadership for the work done for the WCAR. The Government of Canada also sponsored regional prep-conferences and CAERS was represented on the advisory committee and thematic sub-committees. To address hate on the Net and its impact on youth, a conference, Anti-racism Online, was held with support from the BC Human Rights Commission and Simon Fraser University. Following several incidents between students of Asian and European descent, the Pitt Meadow School District contracted with CAERS to provide workshops on anti-racism and to conduct meetings between faculty and student groups. Over the course of several months, tensions were reduced and new guidelines were developed for dealing with complaints. In 2006, CAERS began continued to be active with other community-based groups in monitoring the development of groups like the Aryan Guard in Calgary and Lethbridge, Alberta and Regina, Saskatchewan.

The White Aryan Resistance Movement was a racist California based group. The leader was Tom Metzger who was found to have encouraged the murder of an African immigrant in Portland, Oregon. The Georgia Straight carried the same allegations as the Jewish Western Bulletin but was not sued. The case went to discovery but was dropped. AM 1040 paid legal costs.

It takes place annually to celebrate the Catholic feast of Corpus Christi in Castrillo de Murcia, a village in the municipality of Sasam√≥n in the province of Burgos. It appeared in the British newspaper The Guardian as one of the strangest holidays. Description During the act, known as El Salto del Colacho (the devi jump) or simply El Colacho, men dressed as the Devil (known as the Colacho) in red and yellow suits jump over babies born during the previous twelve months of the year who lie on mattresses in the street. The \\"devils\\" hold whips and oversized castanets as they jump over the infant children. The Brotherhood of Sant√≠simo Sacramento de Minerva organizes the week-long festivities which culminate on Sunday when the Colacho jumps over the babies on the mattresses placed on the procession route traversing the town. The origins of the tradition are unknown but it is said to cleanse the babies of original sin, ensuring them safe passage through life and guard against illness and evil spirits. In recent years, Pope Benedict has asked Spanish priests to distance themselves from El Colacho, as the Church still teaches that it is only by the sacrament of a valid baptism that original sin can be cleansed.

Zombies Dennett extends his well noted attack on the philosophical notion of qualia by using the metaphor of philosophical zombies as well as addressing many popular thought experiments. Dennett's conclusion is that there are no qualia and that the mind, and consciousness, can be understood and explained from the Naturalist school of thought. Fame in the Brain Dennett reposes the question of consciousness addressed in his 1991 book Consciousness Explained. In Consciousness Explained, Dennett established what he called the \\"multiple drafts model\\" of consciousness, which suggested that there was no singular space in the conscious mind. In other words, there is no special location in the brain that can be seen as the qualia-containing \\"consciousness module\\". Instead, he states that consciousness is smeared throughout the brain. He extends the model by creating a similar figure that he calls \\"Fame in the Brain\\" and suggests that the mind acts, to some degree, as an echo chamber, as well as the \\"bundle of semi-independent agencies\\" that he suggested in Consciousness Explained. The main tenet of \\"Fame in the Brain\\" is that consciousness, much like fame, is not the cause, but the aftermath of certain brain processes. Dennett asks us to imagine an author whose book has yet to be released, but will result in unimaginable fame when it does. On Tuesday, when the book is to come out, he is scheduled to go on The Oprah Winfrey Show, to be interviewed on the BBC, and likely be nominated for several awards. However, on Monday, an earthquake destroys the entire city of San Francisco. Naturally, all the media hype that would have revolved around this author is drowned in the focus on San Francisco. Dennett asks, can this man be considered \\"famous\\"? He says that the man is in fact not famous even though the book that would have made him famous remains unchanged. This is because fame, according to Dennett, is not about the cause of the fame, but about the aftermath: the interviews, the magazine covers, the paparazzi, etc. Consciousness is the same way. In order for something to be considered \\"conscious\\", there must be enough correlating neural events that go with it (e.g. memory formation).

It lies in northern Saguache County on the Continental Divide between the Sawatch Range to the north and the Cochetopa Hills to the south. The pass is part of a backcountry alternative to U.S. Highway 50 between Salida and Gunnison. Marshall Pass was discovered by and named for Lt. William L. Marshall, of the Wheeler Survey, in 1873.\\"Lt. Marshall Discovers Marshall Pass\\" History When William Marshall first crossed the pass, he realized that it would be a good route for a road, and shortly after this, a company was organized to build a toll road.Marius R. Campbell, Guidebook of the Western United States, United States Geological Survey Bulletin 707, Government Printing Office, 1922; page 165, see extended footnote. The Marshall Pass Toll Road was completed in 1880, with stagecoach service from Gunnison to the Arkansas River where it connected with the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad.Cleora, Guide to Colorado (part of a larger publication entitled Where to Go to Become Rich), Belford Clarke & Co., 1880; Page 123. This announces the opening of the toll road and stage line as imminent. The new road at the pass summit was barely passable, and the grades on both sides of the pass were reported to be very steep.Fred M. Amelung, Lake City, Colo. Mines, Engineering and Mining Journal, Vol XXIX, No. 25 (June 19, 1880); page 421.G. Thomas Ingham, Chapter XX: Over Marshall Pass, Digging Gold Among the Rockies, Edgewood, 1882; pages 349-353 describe the stagecoach trip over the pass. In 1881, the narrow gauge mainline of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad was built across Marshall Pass on the way from Denver to Salt Lake City. This railroad line was completed before the Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad completed the Alpine Tunnel, so it was the first crossing of the continental divide in Colorado by any railroad. The line reached Sargents, Colorado in August 1881.Railway News, Railway World, Vol. 7, No. 33 (Aug. 13, 1881); page 784, bottom left, top right. By 1884, the line was complete from Ogden, Utah to Denver.Anonymous, The Denver & Rio Grande Railway, Chataqua, Historical and Descriptive, Fairbanks, Palmer & Co., 1884; pages 183-188. Marshall Pass is discussed on page 185.Route No. 45a, Denver to Salt-Lake City, The Englishman's Guide Book to the United States and Canada, Edward Stanford, London, 1884; pages 241-243. The line saw the daily Shavano passenger train until closure. The line closed with the Gunnison Division in 1955, and the rails were removed the same year. Marshall Pass, Colorado was a small settlement, railroad station and post office, located at the pass. The population was 11 in 1948; there were six buildings then. Time Magazine called it \\"the U.S.'s smallest post office.\\" Time magazine, Monday, Nov. 01, 1948 Water diversion Larkspur Ditch at Marshall Pass In 1939, the Catlin Canal Company built the Larkspur ditch to divert water from upper Harry Creek (a tributary of Marshall Creek and eventually Tomichi Creek) south over the continental divide at Marshall Pass, delivering its water into Poncha Creek and thence to the South Arkansas River. The 1.5 mile (2.4 km) ditch has a capacity of approximately 8 cubic feet per second (0.2 m3/s) and average annual deliveries between 1990 and 1999 were 31 acre-feet (38,000 m3).John N. Winchester, A Historical View: Transmountain Development in Colorado , 2000; retrieved July, 2015. The Lower Arkansas Valley Water Conservancy District entered a cooperative agreement with the Catlin Canal Company to improve the ditch in 2004, doubling the length of the ditch and increasing its average annual delivery to over 300-acre-feet (370,000 m3). The water district completed purchase of the ditch in 2011.Chris Woodka, The Lower Arkansas Valley Water Conservancy District files change case for the Larkspur Ditch, The Pueblo Chieftain, Dec. 6, 2006; reprinted in Ark Valley Consumptive Use Rules page 2, retrieved Aug. 2015. Geography The sign at the top of the pass Marshall Pass is just a few miles south of Monarch Pass, and in fact, both were considered as potential routes for U.S. 50, with the latter ultimately being chosen. Today, a gravel road still follows the old railroad route over Marshall Pass. In the summer and late fall, this drive is especially beautiful. It may be driven by regular passenger cars in good conditions. From the east, take U.S. 285 south from Poncha Springs (near Salida) about 6 miles to County Road 200 and turn right; from the west turn right off U.S. 50 at Sargents. While grades are gentler (the railroad had a ruling grade of 4%) than on U.S. 50 over Monarch Pass (7% grades), please note that the Marshall Pass Road is closed to wheeled vehicles during the winter months.

Originally a German citizen, she accompanied her second husband, the Hungarian Bauhaus artist L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, in his move to the United States. She was the author of a study of his work, Moholy-Nagy: Experiment in Totality, plus several other books on architectural history. She was an outspoken critic of what she regarded as the excesses of postwar modernist architecture. After her death in 1971, fellow writer Reyner Banham eulogized her as \\"the most formidable of the group of lady-critics (Jane Jacobs, Ada Louise Huxtable, etc) who kept the U.S. architectural establishment continually on the run during the 50s and 60s\\". Biography Sibylle Pietzsch was born in Dresden on October 29, 1903 to architect Martin Pietzsch (Deutscher Werkbund) and Fanny Clauss Pietzsch. Her father also headed the Dresden Academy. Her family was prosperous, including two older sisters and an older brother. She left her secondary education in the Municipal Lyceum at Dresden‚ÄêNeustadt at 16. She attended the graduate schools of the Universities of Leipzig and Frankfurt, but never finished a university degree. After working at a variety of jobs (including clerical work for Leo Frobenius in 1923), she became an actress, performing on stage and in a couple of films. While performing she went under the stage name \\"Sibyl Peech\\". In 1929, she married the Frankfurt intellectual and industrialist Carl Dreyfuss, a close friend of social philosopher Theodor Adorno. In 1931, she left Frankfurt for Berlin, working as a scriptwriter and editor for Tobis Film Berlin. There she met the former Bauhaus professor, artist, and photographer L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy (1895‚Äì1946) who was trying to get support for what would become his most famous film, A Lightplay black white gray. They became a couple by 1932, and had a daughter Hattula the next year, 1933. Due to the rise of Nazism, L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy worked for a year in Amsterdam in 1934, while Sibyl and Hattula remained in Berlin. The family reunited in London in 1935, where the couple formally married. A second daughter, Claudia, was born in 1936. In 1937, the family emigrated to the United States, settling in Chicago. There, Moholy-Nagy assisted her husband in opening the New Bauhaus in October 1937, which was sponsored by the Association of Arts and Industries. After the New Bauhaus closed in June 1938, Moholy-Nagy helped her husband open his own school, the School of Design in Chicago in February 1939. In 1944 this school was reorganized and renamed the Institute of Design. Her husband died in November 1946 (ten years later, the Institute of Design became a department of the Illinois Institute of Technology, IIT Institute of Design). She finished copyediting her late husband's book Vision in Motion, which was published in 1947. After her husband's death, Moholy-Nagy decided to become an architectural historian and teacher, beginning a productive career publishing many articles and books. Her writings built on knowledge from her father, and from her friendships with Walter Gropius and Sigfried Giedion, who she had met through her husband. Although she lacked formal credentials, her deep knowledge of architectural history allowed her to secure successive teaching positions in Chicago, Peoria, San Francisco, and Berkeley. In 1951, Moholy- Nagy was hired as associate professor of architecture history at Pratt Institute in New York City. She taught courses on such subjects as urban history and design, becoming Pratt's first female full professor in 1960. She became a respected and acclaimed teacher, a commanding classroom presence using her experiences in acting. In spite of this, she retained a secret insecurity about her lack of extensive formal university training. Moholy-Nagy resigned in 1969 over a conflict with other faculty about the future direction of the school, then became a visiting professor at Columbia University in 1970. Writings Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Moholy-Nagy had a parallel career as an architecture critic, maintaining professional relationships with such figures as Philip Johnson and Carlos Raul Villanueva. In 1945 she published a novel, Children's Children, under the pseudonym \\"S. D. Peech\\". In 1950 she wrote a biography of her husband, Moholy-Nagy: Experiment in Totality. In 1952, the Architectural League of New York awarded her an Arnold Brunner research grant to study vernacular architecture, and she subsequently produced Native Genius in Anonymous Architecture (1957), one of the first books on vernacular design for architects, calling attention to traditional buildings compatible with the natural environment. One of her most important books, Matrix of Man: An Illustrated History of Urban Environment (1968), focused on the development of cities and the influence of landscape, regional climate, tradition, culture, and form. She made numerous contributions to architecture magazines, such as Architectural Forum and Progressive Architecture. She was one of the first critics to study postwar Latin American architecture in depth. In her architectural writings, she was not afraid to criticize the postwar architecture of her husband's former colleagues. In 1968, she published an essay in Art in America titled \\"Hitler's Revenge\\". She started this polemic with the words: > In 1933 Hitler shook the tree and America picked up the fruit of German > genius. In the best of Satanic traditions some of this fruit was poisoned, > although it looked at first sight as pure and wholesome as a newborn > concept. The lethal harvest was functionalism, and the Johnnies who spread > the appleseed were the Bauhaus masters Walter Gropius, Mies van der Rohe, > and Marcel Breuer. Personal life Moholy-Nagy married L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy and had two daughters, Hattula (born 1933), and Claudia (1936‚Äì1971). She died in New York City on January 8, 1971.

A club chair' is a type of armchair, usually covered in leather. It was created and made in France. Before it came to be known under its current name, it first appeared as the ', the \\"comfortable armchair\\". It was given this name to distinguish it from the fauteuil de style, which had straighter lines and was less enveloping. The craftsmen involved in the design of the chair were unknown. The origins of the term \\"club\\" are unclear, but it may be a reference to the gentlemen's club.  Characteristics   Shape  Art deco club chair. While the club chair is undoubtedly a classic feature of interior decor in France, it remains just as relevant as ever today. As time has passed, the chair‚Äôs charm, diversity and fame have grown. With great simplicity, the Art Deco era produced armchairs with clean, flexible lines, in contrast to the Art Nouveau style of the 1910s. Club chair. After the Second World War, dozens of different shapes appeared. Some have stood the test of time, such as the \\"moustache\\" and the \\"gendarme‚Äôs hat\\", named after the shape of the backrest. The round shape has become the club armchair‚Äôs most emblematic incarnation.  Manufacture Design, carpentry, fellmongery, upholstery and colouring are the main crafts involved in the manufacture of a club armchair. Each chair is a product of all this combined expertise. The club armchair first appeared at the start of the 20th century, with the application of a new padding technique, using double conical springs not only in the seat cushion but also in the backrest and armrests. Coir filling supplemented the suppleness of these springs. Industrial progress led to the replacement of this padding method with no-sag springs or elastic webbing, together with synthetic foam.  Covering  Coverings have changed as industrial techniques have developed, and have included Mercerised cotton, velvet, calfskin and, most recently, bicast leather. However, sheep's leather is still considered the authentic material for the chairs. Sheep's leather With a vegetable-tanned sheep's leather covering, the marks and defects in the skin are visible through the dye, making each chair unique. Furthermore, the particularly fine grain gives the armchair a unique patina over time. French leather was renowned for its quality in the 19th century. Between six and eight skins of approximately each are required to cover an armchair. They are applied wet, stretched as tightly as possible, and contract as they dry. They will last around 40 years.

Development The aircraft was developed for a contest for a successor of Junkers F-13 as a light passenger and mail plane in LOT Polish Airlines, announced by the Ministry of Communication. The design was partly modeled on a construction of Fokker F.VII, produced under license by Plage i La≈õkiewicz, especially in a wing design. The main designer was Jerzy Rudlicki. The prototype was first flown on 8 February 1930 in Lublin (registration: SP- ACC). From June 1930 it was evaluated by the LOT Airlines. The prototype was damaged during take-off in July 1931, and was not repaired. The aircraft was not successful, because its weight appeared 250 kg more, than designed, it also had worse speed, range and ceiling, than expected (its competitor, the PWS-21, was not successful either). Its improved development became Lublin R-XVI, built in a small series, although not as a passenger plane. Description The R-XI was a mixed construction cantilever high-wing monoplane, single-engine, conventional in layout. It had a steel-framed, canvas-covered fuselage (engine part covered with duralumin) and a single- piece, plywood-covered, three-spar elliptical wing of wooden construction. The empennage was of steel construction, canvas covered. It had a conventional fixed landing gear, with a rear skid, base 2.7 m. The main gear was joined with a wing by struts. The closed cabin had a capacity of six: a pilot, a mechanic and 4 passengers. Two crewmen had twin controls and individual doors on either side, the fifth passenger could be carried instead of the mechanic. The passenger cabin had height 1.5 m and width 1.3 m and two triangular doors on the left side. Behind it there was a place for a baggage. Single engine in front: 9-cylinder air-cooled Polish Skoda Works Wright Whirlwind J-5 radial engine delivering 240 hp (179 kW) take-off power and 220 hp (164 kW) nominal power, with a NACA cowling, driving a two-blade metal propeller of a fixed pitch. A 300-litre fuel tank was fitted in wing and 150-litre under the cab (normal capacity was 200 l). The cruise fuel consumption was 40‚Äì50 l/h.

Words were taken from a poem by Sir John Stanhope Arkwright (1872‚Äì1954), published in The Supreme Sacrifice, and other Poems in Time of War (1919).Songs of Praise Discussed, published 1933,1950, page 167 It was set to music by the Rev. Dr. Charles Harris (1865-1936) who was Vicar of Colwall, Herefordshire between 1909-1929.O Valiant Hearts It his tune, referred to as Harris or sometimes The Supreme Sacrifice that the hymn is now almost always sung. Other tunes Ralph Vaughan Williams, 1954 Gustav Holst Existing tunes used for the hymn include \\"Birmingham\\", a Victorian tune by Francis Cunningham and Farley Castle by Henry Lawes (1596-1662). The poem was later included as a hymn in both editions of the hymn book Songs of Praise. For the first edition, published in 1925, the music was set to a traditional tune, 'Valour', arranged by Ralph Vaughan Williams.Songs of Praise Discussed, published 1931,1950, page 167 In the second, larger edition of Songs of Praise, published in 1931, Gustav Holst composed the tune 'Valiant Hearts' especially for the hymn. In Songs of Praise Discussed, Valiant Hearts is described as 'a good bold tune, in triple time, with a suggestion of bell-chimes in the repeated first phrase, an effect which is enhanced by the nature of the accompaniment to the alternative unison version'. The alternative unison version referred to is written for verses 3 and 7.Songs of Praise Enlarged Edition, with tunes, 1950, page 349 Lyrics O valiant hearts who to your glory came Through dust of conflict and through battle flame; Tranquil you lie, your knightly virtue proved, Your memory hallowed in the land you loved. Proudly you gathered, rank on rank, to war As who had heard God‚Äôs message from afar; All you had hoped for, all you had, you gave, To save mankind‚Äîyourselves you scorned to save. Splendid you passed, the great surrender made; Into the light that nevermore shall fade; Deep your contentment in that blest abode, Who wait the last clear trumpet call of God. Long years ago, as earth lay dark and still, Rose a loud cry upon a lonely hill, While in the frailty of our human clay, Christ, our Redeemer, passed the self same way. Still stands His Cross from that dread hour to this, Like some bright star above the dark abyss; Still, through the veil, the Victor‚Äôs pitying eyes Look down to bless our lesser Calvaries. These were His servants, in His steps they trod, Following through death the martyred Son of God: Victor, He rose; victorious too shall rise They who have drunk His cup of sacrifice. O risen Lord, O Shepherd of our dead, Whose cross has bought them and Whose staff has led, In glorious hope their proud and sorrowing land Commits her children to Thy gracious hand.

Etymology The most common explanation for the neighborhood‚Äôs name is its view of the biblical River Arnon, now Wadi Mujib in Jordan, running from the Moab Hills to the Dead Sea. Geography Arnona is one of the highest points in Jerusalem at 800 meters above sea level. From Arnona one can see the Judean Desert, the Dead Sea, and, as mentioned, the River Arnon/Wadi Mujib. The neighborhood is bordered by the Hebron Road/Derech Hevron and Talpiot neighbourhood to the west, Kibbutz Ramat Rachel to the south, Old Talpiot to the north, and the Judean desert to the east. History Antiquity In 2020, the remains of a large Iron Age II compound were discovered near the US Embassy. The site served for the collection and storage of taxes in the form of agricultural produce, and was first used during the reign of two biblical kings of Judah, Hezekiah and Manasseh (together they ruled from c. 715-643).Borschel-Dan, Amanda, Huge Kingdom of Judah government complex found near US Embassy in Jerusalem, Times of Israel, 22 July 2020 Zionist settlement, beginnings Arnona was founded in 1931 on land owned by the Keren HaEzra company according to plans created by the architect Richard Kauffmann. In 1935, another neighbourhood named ‚ÄúBinyan v‚ÄôMelacha‚Äù was founded alongside Talpiot; this neighborhood has since been incorporated into the Arnona area. Together with other nearby Jewish areas (Talpiot and Mekor Chaim), Arnona gradually became a southern suburb of Jerusalem separated from the main city by the Arab neighborhoods of Baka and Talbieh, and the German Colony area. 1948-1967 events During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Arnona was on the front line. In May 1948, Arnona was occupied by Arab forces. An attack by Egyptian, Jordanian, and local Arab troops led to a retreat by Jewish forces from Arnona and Ramat Rachel. A combined unit of the Hagana and Palmach later retook the area.The Battle for Ramat Rachel, The Southern Gateway to Jerusalem Yehuda Lapidot The 1949 cease fire agreement with Jordan placed the cease-fire line at the eastern border of Arnona. This cease fire line was part of the \\"Kav Ironi\\", the Jerusalem section of the Green line separating the Jordanian and Israeli armies. The border was patrolled by a dedicated force, but the only physical barrier was an unguarded barbed-wire fence. With the Six-Day War in 1967, Arnona gained its current borders. Post-1967 evolution In 1970, Yeshivas Mercaz Hatorah, a post high school yeshiva for students from the diaspora, was opened on Rechov Ein Tsurim by its founder Rabbi Aryeh Rottman. Until the 1990s, Arnona was similar in nature to the Old Talpiot area. During the 1990s, a widespread building trend led to a rise in property value and made Arnona into a relatively upscale neighborhood. Buildings in the area are generally no more than six stories in high. Today, virtually all plots of land in Arnona are occupied. Much of the land currently built on was sold to developers by Kibbutz Ramat Rachel. The United States Embassy to Israel moved to Arnona, May, 14, 2018. Previously, the building had been designated as the US Consulate General in Jerusalem. On February 23, 2018, the Trump Administration announced that the United States Embassy to Israel would relocate to the Arnona premises of the Consulate General by May 14 to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the Israeli Declaration of Independence. The interim Embassy in Arnona contains office space for the US Ambassador and a small staff. There are plans to open a new Embassy annex on the Arnona compound in 2019 while the search for a permanent embassy site continues.

He is a property developer in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, who, in the 1990s and 2000s, played a significant and controversial part in the city's real- estate boom. He has been described as \\"a leading contributor to Vancouver's 'City of Glass' reputation\\" during a period in which the city's skyline has been transformed, along with its economic and social profile.. For Vancouver as a \\"city of glass\\", see . Rejecting the label \\"developer\\", Wall has stated that he \\"just make[s] some money investing in business ideas and projects\\". Wall emigrated from Eastern Europe to Canada as a child, shortly after the Second World War. During the 1990s, when Vancouver was changing from a provincial port tied to the British Columbian lumber industry to a major multicultural gateway for immigrants from around the Pacific Rim, Wall and his company Wall Financial Corporation helped revitalize the city's downtown area. In the process, Wall benefitted from and propelled a property boom that continues to this day. His career has earned him both criticism and praise. Wall has been described as the city's \\"ultimate business maverick\\" in the press, which depicts him as a colourful, flamboyant character which resounds through his architecture. The controversial award-winning hotel and delicate condominium tower, One Wall Centre, completed in 2001, is regarded as his crowning achievement. At the time of its construction, this skyscraper was the highest and most fragile in Vancouver. By the end of 2008, One Wall Centre was overtaken by the 61-storey tower, Living Shangri-La. Wall is also known for his catty legal scrapes and for his personal and public generosity. He fought a protracted legal battle with the city over the height and cladding of One Wall Centre. He has been a significant donor to the University of British Columbia, making in 1991 what was then the largest private donation in the university's history. However, the Wall donation should bear an asterisk as sources have suggested that the Wall donation was, in fact, made by UBC alumni and local flamboyant business maverick Peter A Allard. Life Wall was born to a Mennonite family in Ukraine, and he spent his childhood in Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Austria. In 1948, he moved to Canada with his mother and five siblings. The family settled in Abbotsford, British Columbia. Wall enrolled at the University of British Columbia in 1958, where he studied chemistry but did not graduate.For the date, see ; for the fact that he did not finish the degree, see , where he is said to have been studying Pharmacy. Given C$6,000 by his mother to build a house, he sold the finished product for $13,000 before she had moved in. He later claimed he \\"discovered right then how easy it was to make money in the real-estate business\\".; has a slightly different version of the same story Despite his early exit from academia, he donated $15 million to UBC in 1991, at the time the largest private donation it had received. The university used the gift to found the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies. In 1995, UBC awarded Wall an honorary doctorate. His degree citation credited him with \\"a creative and innovative mind which allows him to bring unconventional solutions to otherwise insoluble problems\\". Wall has regularly been ranked as the highest-paid executive in Vancouver. In both 1998 and 1999, he earned $1.4 million, although in some years he has earned less, because his salary is linked to the firm's pre-tax profits. Frequently called \\"flamboyant\\", according to journalist Drew Hasselback, he is known for his \\"outspoken opinions, designer clothes, German accent, in-your-face enthusiasm and self-confessed love of spending money\\". In 2007, The Vancouver Sun interviewed Wall as he leant on the fender of a special-edition Bentley Turbo R sedan. He said that it cost \\"$300,000 or $320,000 but ‚Äì what's it matter? ‚Äì they're only worth a hundred [$100,000], anyway\\". The newspaper dubbed him the \\"Condo King\\". Wall's approach to business has sometimes caused conflict. He reportedly admitted, \\"I have been a bit impulsive at times and I do want to be more respectful of my fellow man\\". On occasion, he has been impulsively generous. According to an anecdote reported in The Vancouver Sun, in 2002 he gave a Rolls Royce convertible to a friend to save him from having to walk to a meeting. Thoroughbred racing Peter Wall is involved in the sport of Thoroughbred horse racing in Canada and the United States, racing in the latter from a base in California. Among his racing successes, Missionary Ridge was a top performer at Southern California racetracks in the 1990s. He was a grandson of the legendary Canadian-bred British Triple Crown champion, Nijinsky. Missionary Ridge's Graded stakes race wins included the Carleton F. Burke Handicap and Pacific Classic Stakes. Wall Financial Corporation Founded in 1969 as \\"Wall & Redekop Corp.\\", and listed since 1973 on the Toronto Stock Exchange (),Symbol \\"WFC\\". Wall Financial Corporation is a publicly traded real-estate investment and development company. Wall's early property deals, in the 1960s, were made in the suburbs of South Vancouver. In the late 1980s, when the company acquired its first major downtown site, Wall became the corporation's majority owner with a 56% stake. By January 2008, its annual revenue was $199.5 million, with a net income of $24.5 million. At that time, the company was listed as owning and managing \\"980 rental residential units and 865 hotel rooms\\". The company has been described as a barometer of Vancouver's real-estate market; but Wall and his firm have also been accused of driving up land values themselves. Wall stepped down as Director and Chairman of the Board in 2005 and is now its Consultant and Advisor. Since 1994, the company's President has been Wall's nephew, Bruno Wall.. For the relationship between Bruno and Peter, see and . Vancouver real estate Wall owes his success not only to hard work and an ability to anticipate the market but to the favourable economic and social conditions of Vancouver's 1990s and 2000s real-estate boom.His \\"ability to divine [Vancouver's] ultra-competitive downtown development market\\" is described as \\"uncanny\\" by Ashley Ford (); the realtor Bob Rennie, a friend of Wall's, has said that \\"no one can anticipate the market more precisely than Peter Wall\\" (). In his book City of Glass (2000), local novelist Douglas Coupland claims that real estate is \\"Vancouver's biggest sport [...] and is disturbingly central to the city's psyche. Real estate agents are local celebs of sorts\\". In the early 1980s, the city experienced an economic recession as British Columbia's traditionally dominant lumber industry struggled. The most obvious consequence of the recession was a marked fall in property values. In the next decade, however, Vancouver became less dependent on the economic fortunes of the rest of the province, and real-estate values held firm in the city even in 1991 when forest industries made record losses. During the seven years at the turn of the 1990s, Vancouver's economy grew faster than that of all but three other North American cities. According to cultural critic Paul Delany, writing in 1994, this success \\"may be credited to its relatively vital and efficient downtown core\\". As Vancouver's economy continued to develop independently of its interior, the city also prospered from its location on the Pacific Rim. In particular, the 1990s saw an influx of immigrants and capital from Hong Kong in the lead-up to the colony's handover in 1997 from the British to the Chinese. As The New York Times noted in 1997, panic after the Tiananmen Square killings of 1989 \\"sent many Hong Kong families packing. They became rich overnight when they sold tiny apartments in Hong Kong for well over $1 million\\". Arriving in Canada, these wealthy immigrants in turn triggered \\"sky high real estate prices\\" in their new host city. Vancouver architect Ron Yuen believes that they \\"also brought with them a strong sense of the economic value of land, a sense that has since been developed by local residents who buy condo units before buildings are constructed\\". If the first two elements in Vancouver's late-20th-century transformation were the influx from Hong Kong and a dense downtown core that the city was interested in further developing, the third was what social planner Baldwin Wong called \\"a combination of developers‚Äô expertise and the injection of new capital into the market\\". This was where Wall and others came to the fore in leading the residential development of the downtown peninsula. With mountains to the north and ocean to the west, there was, in the words of The Globe and Mail, \\"nowhere to go but up\\". One Wall Centre One Wall Centre, a two-tone tower tall Wall's most famous building is One Wall Centre, part of the Wall Centre Complex in downtown Vancouver. Completed in 2001, it has been called \\"the crowning achievement of his life's work\\". The commissioned architect, Peter Busby, said that \\"Wall represents a dying breed -- a client willing to take a risk to build a tower that will stand out\\". The building became, however, the object of a legal battle between Wall and the city. At , the tower was designed to exceed the height limit of for the location. Toronto's Financial Post reported that Wall \\"obtained an exemption from the bylaw on his promise the tower's windows would be transparent\\", only for the city subsequently to sue on the basis that \\"the tower's windows were not transparent, and that the building threatened to be a 'dark, forbidding obelisk' on the highest ground in the downtown core\\". In turn, Wall counter-sued and offered the city $2-3 million if they would let him keep the dark glass. In the course of the ensuing public debate, the building was nicknamed the \\"Death Star\\", and Wall, \\"Darth Vader\\". The issue was resolved by the installation of darker glass on the first 30 floors, and lighter glass from floors 32 to 48. Wall fitted each unit in the upper floors with dark blinds which, in the view of the authors of Vancouver: The Unknown City, \\"mimic the original dark glass when closed\\". In 2002, the building was named the previous year's \\"best new skyscraper\\" by skyscraper.com.. These awards have now been renamed the Emporis Skyscraper Awards. For Vancouver, some felt it showed that \\"if Mr. Wall has his way, laid-back Lotus Land is in for some flamboyant changes\\".. This article goes into some detail about criticisms of Wall's approach, but argues that the Wall Centre controversy reduced his clout. Other construction projects Wall's construction projects have included Capitol Residences, a 42-storey condominium tower on the site of Vancouver's Capitol Theatre, which incorporates an extension to the city's Orpheum Theatre. Wall said he was attracted to this project as a way to help the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, whose home is the Orpheum. The result was portrayed in The Globe and Mail as an attempt \\"to bring the tinsel back to downtown\\". Among Wall's innovations was a car-sharing scheme to attract buyers to one of his properties. The idea was reported in 2003 as a ploy to sell more condos in an increasingly saturated market. In 2004, Wall was involved in the acquisition of Hastings Racecourse. At the time of the deal, he was described as \\"a renowned philanthropist, real estate baron and successful horse owner [with] a love for horse racing\\".. The Blood-Horse reports that he \\"has raced a number of stakes winners\\" (). Wall's friend Bob Rennie, who has worked extensively with him, described the Wall formula as \\"Great location, smaller suites. Put in a Sub- Zero fridge and a Wolf range with red knobs, and they'll line up to buy it\\".. On Rennie as \\"condo king\\", see the profile in . On the relationship between himself and Wall, Rennie has said, \\"I have coffee with Peter Wall every Sunday afternoon. He‚Äôs a dear friend and obviously a very important client\\" (). In May 2008, Wall Corporation bought a building at 1212 Howe Street in downtown Vancouver. In charge of the building's sales and marketing campaign, Rennie claimed that it \\"played right into Peter Wall's model of 'take a prime location and undersize the suites a bit' \\".. Many commentators argue that Vancouver's real-estate boom, which has been accused of increasing the divide between its rich and poor, is a bubble about to burst.See and, for a national view that also encompasses Vancouver, . As of May 2008, Wall himself remained buoyant. \\"I'm trying to keep the price down, \\" he remarked, \\" so that everybody can make a deal that's equitable, and then we can all make money. To live in B.C., you're lucky. To live in the Lower Mainland, you're very lucky. To live in Vancouver and own real estate, you have won the lottery\\". Philanthropy Wall has been described as a philanthropist, and donated $1 million to the University of British Columbia. He received an honorary PhD for his donation. Peter Wall has no formal post secondary education. He established the Peter Wall Endowment with a gift of 6.5 million shares in Wall Financial Corporation, a donation valued over $200 million today. The Endowment also provided the university with the money to found the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies. He provides annual financial support to the Canadian National Institute for the Blind and helped the renowned Canadian architect Arthur Erickson keep tenancy of his house and garden after a bankruptcy.

In 1912, Chu Guiting began to study Xingyiquan (Shape and Mind Boxing) and Baguazhang (Eight Trigram Boxing) under Grandmaster Li Cunyi, who recognized him as his official disciple. At the age of twenty, Chu Guiting left his hometown and traveled extensively throughout China, visiting Beijing and Tianjin, Liaoning in the north, and Wuhan, Changsha, and Nanchang in the south. In 1921, Chu Guiting studied Yang-shi taijiquan (Yang Style Grand Ultimate Fist) in Hangzhou under Yang Chengfu ‚Äì a direct descendant of the style's progenitor, Yang Luchan. In doing so, he became one of the \\"Five Tiger Generals\\". Between 1916 and 1940, Chu Guiting was heavily involved in martial arts in both Jiangsu and Shanghai. During this time he worked with the East China Five Province General's Bodyguards, the Central Chinese Boxing Association, the Zhejiang Province Chinese Boxing Association, the Central Police Officers Association, the Presidential Palace Bodyguards, the National Government's Military Department, and the Jiangsu Public Security Headquarters. He also taught Chinese martial arts privately. In 1928, General Li, General Zhang Zi Jiang, and General Fung Zu Ziang held the first full- contact national competition in Nanjing, China. The purpose was to find the best candidates for teaching positions at the government-sponsored Central Martial Arts Academy. Hundreds of the best Chinese martial artists participated in sanda, weapons, and shuai jiao. After several days, the fighting competitions were halted because too many competitors were seriously injured. Two died. Since the fights were stopped prematurely, 12 martial artists have historically been remembered as \\"the champion\\". Chu Guiting was one of them. During the 1950s, Chu Guiting settled in Shanghai and began to teach classes in Waitan Park, Fuxing Park, and the Peoples‚Äô Park. He also taught classes for a wide range of companies including the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, the Government's Public Security Department, the Shanghai Electric Cable Factory, the Poplar Tree Beach Power Plant, and the Eternal Peace Company. In 1958, Chu Guiting was invited to become the Chinese National Martial Arts Committee's Assistant Director. Following this, he was invited with Wang Ziping and Lu Zhenduo to choreograph a sword dance for the Shanghai Song and Dance Institution, which won a silver medal at the World Youth Festival. In 1956, Chu Guiting, Cai Longyun, Fu Zhongwen, and Zhang Yu were commissioned by the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Education Union to condense and simplify Yang-shi taijiquan (Yang Style Grand Ultimate Fist) into a general system that could be conveniently studied by the masses. Shortly afterwards, Chu Guiting, Gu Liuxin, and Fu Zhongwen were invited to Beijing to formulate the famous Simplified 24 and 28 Step Yang-shi taijiquan (Yang Style Grand Ultimate Fist), forms that are still practiced throughout China today. Chu Guiting was a renowned teacher. It was his belief that in order to learn martial arts one must harmonize the body, the breath, and the mind. Many Chinese martial artists trace their lineage back to Chu Guiting, and he taught artists from other styles. For example, he taught Xingyiquan, Baguazhang, and Taijiquan to Chan Yik Yan. In teaching, Chu Guiting paid particular attention to the moral philosophy of Chinese martial arts, and would often say: \\"With morals much can be achieved, without them nothing can be achieved. Consider, for example, somebody who studies a martial art but does not recognize its moral and philosophical depth. They will soon give it up because they have only ever tasted the skin of the grape and not the fruit that it contains.\\" Chu Guiting died on 16 February 1977.

The limestone was originally formed in Jurassic times. It is made from the remains of billions of tiny sea- creatures which lived in a warm shallow sea that covered the area 150 million years ago.Barnack Hills and Holes NNR English Nature (former), 2004 Barnack‚Äôs rich flora supports a wide variety of wildlife, especially insects, and a number of nationally scarce species are found. Limestone grasslands are traditionally grazed with sheep and at Barnack, grazing is carried out in autumn by up to 300 sheep. These remove the summer growth and build-up of leaves, stalks and grass tussocks that would otherwise die back to form a dead layer, or litter, on the ground. Without grazing, the build-up of coarse grasses and litter would rapidly choke the rarer lime-loving plants.Rollins, Julian Land Marks: Impressions of England‚Äôs National Nature Reserves English Nature, 2003 References External links *Friends of Barnack Hills and Holes Category:Nature Conservation Review sites Category:Geography of Peterborough Category:National nature reserves in England Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Cambridgeshire ","title":"Barnack Hills &amp; Holes National Nature Reserve"},{"id":"17644218","text":"Neƒëeljko Vlahoviƒá (Cyrillic: He–¥e—ô–∫o B–ªaxo–≤–∏—õ, born 15 January 1984) is a Montenegrin football midfielder, who plays with FK Kom Podgorica in the Montenegrin Second League.

Inter-Island constructed the Kona Inn in 1928, the first hotel in Kona on the Big Island of Hawaii. In 1929, Inter-Island created an airline subsidiary, Inter-Island Airways, that is still operating as Hawaiian Airlines. History Shipbuilder Thomas R. Foster moved to Hawaii in 1857 and founded Inter-Island Steam Navigation in 1883. Inter-Island's early ships included the James Makee, Iwalani, and the Helene. James A. Kennedy was recruited from the Honolulu Iron Works to become President of Inter-Island in 1902. In 1905, Kennedy absorbed the Wilder Steamship Co. into Inter-Island, creating the largest fleet of steamers serving the Hawaiian Islands. In 1925, Inter-Island had four steamers: SS Humuula, SS Hawaii, SS Waialeale, and SS Haulalai  Kona Inn  Kona Inn Shopping Village, Kailua-Kona, Hawaii 2 (4549530456) To promote travel to the Big Island, Inter-Island's Board of Directors approved the construction of the Kona Inn, the first hotel in Kona. They hired architect Charles William Dickey, who was known for his distinctive Hawaiian style design. The oceanfront Kona Inn opened in 1928, with 20 rooms, a salt water swimming pool, tennis courts, spacious lawns, cocktail lounge, and luaus. The Kona Inn eventually expanded to 220 rooms, and helped turn Kona into a premier tourist destination The Kona Inn was converted into the Kona Inn Shopping Village in 1980.  Inter-Island Airways  James Kennedy's son, Stanley Kennedy Sr., returned from WWI after flying Curtiss H-16 flyingboats for the US Navy and joined his father in management at Inter- Island. Stan Kennedy convinced the Inter-Island Steam Navigation Board of Directors to expand their business into the fledgling aviation industry. On January 30, 1929, the company founded a subsidiary, Inter-Island Airways, that would later become Hawaiian Airlines.  Strike of 1938  On August 1, 1938 protests against the company by several unions resulted in the Hilo massacre. Inter-Island's SS Waialeale arrived in Hilo crewed by strike-breakers, to be met by 200 protesting longshoremen. A riot ensued between the police and longshoremen with at least 16 rounds fired (7 birdshot and 9 buckshot), at least one bayonet stabbing, clubs, and fire hoses. There were no fatalities, but many injuries.  Downfall  During WW II, Inter-Island Steam Navigation's ships were commandeered into military service by the War Shipping Administration. The lack of civilian cargo ships led to the proliferation of airborne cargo and passenger transportation between the Hawaiian Islands. The 14 hour voyage from Honolulu to Hilo on a steamer, could now be done in 100 minutes on a DC-3 aircraft. Inter-Island Steam Navigation's passenger and cargo service was essentially a victim of Inter-Island Airways success, as well as the creation of Aloha Airlines in 1946, and discontinued operations in 1947.

The fundamental Factory Physics framework states that the essential components of all value streams or production processes or service processes are demand and transformation which are described by structural elements of flows and stocks. There are very specific practical, mathematical relationships that enable one to describe and control the performance of flows and stocks. The book states that, in the presence of variability, there are only three buffers available to synchronize demand and transformation with lowest cost and highest service level: *Capacity *Inventory *Response time The book states that its approach enables practical, predictive understanding of flows and stocks and how to best use the three levers to optimally synchronize demand and transformation.

Mamluk and Ottoman eras During the reign of Mamluk Sultan Baibars al-Bunduqdari in the 13th century, Anabta served as a central staging point from which to supply the Muslim armies fighting Crusader and Mongol incursions. The location was chosen because it was considered relatively easy to protect as the area is nestled between two large hills. During Ottoman rule, Anabta was listed in the 1596 Ottoman tax register as being in the Nahiya of Jabal Sami of the Liwa of Nablus. It had a population of 55 Muslim households who paid a fixed tax rate of 33,3% on wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, goats or beehives, and presses for grapes or olives; a total of 13,757 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 127 In 1852, the American scholar Edward Robinson visited the village.

Biography Early life Valdemar Psilander was born in Copenhagen, Denmark on 9 May 1884. At the age of 15, he was employed as an apprentice actor at the Casino theater in Copenhagen and performed at both the Frederiksberg and Dagmar Theaters through 1909. His stage performances were not particularly notable. Valdemar Psilander, Det Danske Filmistitut, retrieved [2008-05-27] Film career Psilander debuted on screen in the fall of 1910 in The Portrait of Dorian Gray for a small film company, Regia Kunst Film. He was immediately hired away by Nordisk Film to perform in August Blom's Ved F√¶ngslets Port (At the Prison Gates). Valdemar Psilander -- a global star from Nordisk Film Nordisk Film Press, April 10, 2006, retrieved 2008-05-27 Psilander's charismatic performance earned him great praise and he quickly became Nordisk's highest-paid actor. Within two years, he was named the most popular male actor in film magazine readership polls around the world. During the course of the next 6 years, Psilander made 83 films. In 1911, Nordisk Film had a fine international reputation and a wide distribution network, but it was Psilander's films which spearheaded the company's sales. He was especially popular among German, Russian and Hungarian audiences. He appeared in such films as Evangeliemandens Liv (The Candle and the Moth) directed by Holger-Madsen, and Klovnen directed by A.W. Sandberg, which was released after his death. Psilander's fees peaked in 1915, when he earned an annual salary of 100,000 DKK. (By comparison, the next highest paid star of the era, Olaf F√∏nss, received 14,000 DKK). Psilander seldom granted interviews.Larsen, Lisbeth Richter, \\"Valdemar Psilander -- A world Star in Danish Film\\" , CINEGRAFIE #17, 2004; retrieved 2008-05-27] In a rare newspaper interview from 1913, he spoke about his acting method: \\"We so often see fine stage actors become nothing on film because they don't understand that it depends upon concentration. The interesting thing about film is that we play to all social classes and in all parts of the world. We must in our means of expression appear nearly primitively genuine, truly original. One can perhaps learn to become an actor but you can never learn to be filmed. Studied emotions on film become artificial and false. Film relentlessly demands truthfulness and sincerity.\\"Valdemar Psilander, Interview, K√∏benhavn Avis, March 4, 1913, retrieved [2008-05-27] Marriage and death Psilander married the actress Edith Buemann.

The Bangladesh national cricket team goes by the nickname of the Tigers ‚Äì after the royal Bengal tiger. At present among the most popular cricket players in Bangladesh, Tamim Iqbal, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mashrafe Bin Mortaza ( captain). Bangladesh's victory in the ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup which was held in South Africa in 2020 is the country's biggest cricketing achievement. Governing body The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) (known then as the Bangladesh Cricket Control Board) was established in 1972.

They also take part in officially sanctioned ACC tournaments including the Asia Cup, Asian Test Championship, ACC Trophy and the Asian Cricket Junior Tournament. Bangladesh also has an active women's team which gained One Day International status after finishing 5th at the 2011 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier. The women's team also claimed the silver medal at the 2010 Asian Games cricket tournament. History The history of cricket in Bangladesh predates the foundation of the Bangladeshi state in 1971 by nearly two centuries. Cricket was introduced to Bengal by the British in the eighteenth century but its growth in East Bengal was slow. Following Partition and the creation of East Pakistan, both first-class and Test cricket were played there during the 1950s and 1960s. Although cricket continued to be popular after independence, especially in Dhaka, the country lost first-class status and had to establish itself in international competition as an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Bangladeshi international cricket began in 1976/77 when the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) came to play against the Bangladesh national side. MCC played their first match against a regional team in Rajshahi with the match ending in a draw. The first unofficial Test against the MCC was played at Dhaka on 4 January 1977. The Bangladesh national team then went on to play against teams like Sri Lanka, Deccan Blues and MCC in the later years. After winning the 1997 ICC Trophy and making a good showing at the 1999 Cricket World Cup, Bangladesh created its National Cricket League (NCL) in 1999‚Äì2000 to prepare the way for full membership of the ICC. This was granted in 2000 and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) was formally established. In November 2000, the Bangladesh national team played its inaugural Test match against India at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka; India won by 9 wickets. The 2000‚Äì01 season saw the beginning of first- class domestic competition in Bangladesh, although the country had already staged first-class matches against touring teams in the previous year. The Green Delta National Cricket League was constituted as the first-class championship and the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea One-Day League as the premier limited overs competition. In 2000‚Äì01, both titles were won by Biman Bangladesh Airlines. The National Cricket League had in fact been inaugurated in the 1999‚Äì2000 season but was not then first-class. In 2000‚Äì01, eight teams played 12 matches each in two groups. Group A consisted of Biman Bangladesh Airlines, Chittagong Division, Rajshahi Division and Dhaka Division. Group B had Dhaka Metropolis, Khulna Division, Barisal Division and Sylhet Division. Four teams qualified for a final stage in which they each played a further 8 games. In 2001‚Äì02, Ispahani Mirzapore Tea became the sponsor of the National Cricket League in addition to the One-Day League. Now Sahara sponsor the national team. Bengal Cricket was first introduced into Bengal by the British East India Company in the eighteenth century and the first cricket matches recorded were in Calcutta in 1792, but matches were possibly played more than a decade earlier and the sport quickly achieved popularity in western Bengal and neighbouring Bihar. In eastern Bengal, the area which is now Bangladesh, cricket developed very slowly as the area failed to attract large numbers of European settlers until the second half of the nineteenth century. The problems were the region's predominantly rural character and its lack of infrastructure given that it had numerous rivers and travel was extremely difficult. The confluence of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra is in central Bangladesh and the coastal area consists of the Sundarbans mangrove forest and the Ganges Delta. The British saw it as a remote region with few economic incentives. Improvement was gradual and it was not until the 1860s and 1870s that the British built the new roads that facilitated communication. Work was done to improve water supplies, with a consequent boost to public health, and Europeans began to settle in Dhaka with cricket soon becoming one of their favourite recreational activities, as had happened elsewhere in India. In 1876, a European XI met and defeated a Native XVIII in Dhaka.Roy Morgan, Encyclopaedia of World Cricket, SportsBooks Limited (2007), p.31. A team representative of Bengal played against G. F. Vernon's XI, the first English team to visit the Indian sub-continent, in 1889‚Äì90.Bengal v Vernon's XI, 1889‚Äì90 In January 1923, Bengal took part in the Nagpur Provincial Tournament with Bombay and a Central Provinces XI.Nagpur Provincial Tournament itinerary, 1923 In 1934, the Board of Control for Cricket in India organised the Ranji Trophy but Bengal did not take part in 1934‚Äì35. Bengal achieved first-class status in December 1935 when they played the Australian tourists and were defeated by 9 wickets. In January 1936, Bengal joined the Ranji Trophy, playing in the East Zone, and reached the semi-final where they lost to Madras. In 1937, Bengal were runners-up and, in 1939, winners of the Ranji Trophy. Throughout this period, Bengal was essentially a West Bengal team. They were based in Calcutta and played all their matches at Eden Gardens. The earliest match of note in Dhaka was in February 1941 when a Bengal Governor's XI played the Bengal Gymkhana at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, then called the Dacca Stadium.Bengal Governor's XI v Bengal Gymkhana, 1941 With the Partition of British India in 1947, Bengal itself was partitioned with West Bengal remaining an Indian province and East Bengal becoming the eastern wing of Pakistan. In 1955, the western wing became West Pakistan and East Bengal became the new province of East Pakistan. The two wings were separated by some 1,600 km (1,000 miles) of Indian territory and, despite their common religion of Islam, the ethnic and linguistic gulf between the two, compounded by an apathetic government based in the west, eventually resulted in the independence of Bangladesh. While Pakistani cricket was strong in the west, there was no first-class cricket in East Bengal until the 1954‚Äì55 season. East Pakistan Between the 1954‚Äì55 and 1970‚Äì71 seasons, thirteen East Pakistan first-class cricket teams played in Pakistan's domestic cricket competitions, the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy and the Ayub Trophy. Many played in only a single season or two. The most prolific were East Pakistan (nine seasons), Dhaka University, East Pakistan Greens and East Pakistan Whites (three each). Chittagong is a good example of the sporadic way in which teams from East Pakistan were involved in the national competitions as they were scheduled to play three matches between 1959‚Äì60 and 1965‚Äì66 and all were abandoned without play starting. The main East Pakistan team played first-class matches against the touring Indians in 1954‚Äì55 and Marylebone Cricket Club in 1955‚Äì56. East Pakistan staged Test cricket from January 1955 when a match between Pakistan and India was allocated to the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka. The stadium was used for numerous important matches including Tests through the 1960s. The M. A. Aziz Stadium in Chittagong also dates back to 1954 as a first-class venue but it was not used for Tests until Bangladesh played there in 2001. Relations between East and West Pakistan had been tense since Partition. East Pakistan was plunged into turmoil on 12 November 1970 when Cylone Bhola struck Bengal with enormous loss of life and devastating impact on the community and economy. The Pakistani government, based in West Pakistan, was roundly condemned for procrastination in its response to the crisis. A few weeks later, when the country's first general election was held on 7 December, widespread outrage in the East resulted in victory for the Awami League which was a Bengali nationalist party under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. This led to an opening of talks between representatives of the East and West wings of Pakistan about the future of the country's constitution under a national government headed by the Awami League, and proposals for the division of power between the central government and the provinces. The talks were unsuccessful in breaking a deadlock and, on 1 March 1971, Pakistani President Yahya Khan indefinitely postponed the pending National Assembly session, precipitating massive civil disobedience in East Pakistan. Three weeks later, Bangladesh formally declared its independence and the country was plunged into its liberation war which raged through 1971 until intervention by India, in support of the Bangladeshis, on 3 December 1971. The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was short-lived and resulted in Pakistan's capitulation on 16 December 1971, celebrated as Victory Day in Bangladesh, which was then established as a new nation. The last first-class match to be completed in East Pakistan was between a Pakistan Cricket Board XI and the touring International XI in Dhaka from 26 February to 1 March 1971.CricketArchive: BCCP XI v International XI 1971 It was drawn and its final day coincided with Yahya Khan's suspension of the National Assembly, the action which finally triggered the liberation war. The International XI left Dhaka next day for Lahore and played one further match there to end their tour. Two Quaid-i-Azam Trophy matches scheduled to be played in Dhaka during March were both cancelled because of the national emergency.List of first- class matches in Pakistan 1970‚Äì71 1972 to 1977 After independence, the new state endured poverty, famine, political turmoil and military coups until the restoration of democracy in 1991 which has been followed by relative calm and economic progress. Cricket had to find its way forward amid the turmoil but it was helped by successive governments, civil and military, which treated its development with some importance. In 1972, the government created the Bangladesh Cricket Board, then called the Bangladesh Cricket Control Board, with a directive to organise cricket in the new country. In the aftermath of the war, this was no easy task. Barclays World of Cricket records that, in early 1975, the national stadium in Dhaka was \\"in such disrepair (some buildings being shell-torn) that the cricket square had sunk several inches after years of disuse\\".Barclays World of Cricket, E. W. Swanton (editor), Willow Books (1986), p.75. The problems of post-war recovery apart, cricket was popular in Dhaka and the first organised competition of note was the club- level Dhaka Metropolis Knockout Tournament staged in February and March 1973.Matches in 1973 Dhaka Metropolis Knockout Tournament A national club championship began in 1974‚Äì75 and has been held in most seasons to 2015.National Cricket Championship 1974-75 This gained sponsorship by the Wills tobacco company from 1983‚Äì84, then by Pepsi from 1993‚Äì94, but it has never been a first-class competition. It has similar status to league cricket in England or grade cricket in Australia. The worst of the problems had been addressed by the start of the 1976‚Äì77 season. In January 1977, the inaugural Bangladesh national cricket team was selected for a match against the touring MCC at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. MCC also played against North Zone, East Zone and South Zone which was the first time that any of these teams, now in the Bangladesh Cricket League, were selected. Although the MCC team included some notable county cricket players such as Mick Norman, John Barclay, Dan Piachaud and Nigel Popplewell, their matches on the 1976‚Äì77 tour were not first-class. Even so, Bangladesh made a favourable impression on MCC and it was in 1977 that the country became an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). 1978 to 1986 The first full international team to visit Bangladesh was Sri Lanka in January 1978. Sri Lanka was then close to ICC Full Member status (achieved in 1982) and their higher standard was underlined by a series of innings victories in the three international matches against Bangladesh. The three-day match in Dhaka starting on 13 January 1978, which Sri Lanka won by an innings and 9 runs, was Bangladesh's debut in international cricket but the very low standard of Bangladeshi cricket at the time means that it was not a first-class match.CricketArchive scorecard: Bangladesh v Sri Lanka 1977‚Äì78. Sri Lanka also played against a BCB President's XI, South Zone and Central Zone, the first time that this team was selected. In early February, the first Indian team to visit Bangladesh was the Hyderabad Blues who played a single game in Dhaka against the national team. MCC returned in December 1978 and played six matches at various locations, five of them against the national team. None of the 1978 matches were first-class. Bangladesh made their competitive international debut when taking part in the 1979 ICC Trophy, held in England between 22 May and 21 June, but failed to reach the semi-final stage. Captained by Raqibul Hasan, Bangladesh were in Group B (there were three qualifying groups of five teams each) against Canada, Denmark, Fiji and Malaysia. Bangladesh struggled in their opening match against Fiji but were rescued by Ashraful Haque who took 7‚Äì23 to secure a 22-run victory. In the second match, Bangladesh were well beaten by Canada. They won convincingly against Malaysia and so needed to defeat Denmark in the last match to qualify for the semi-finals. It was a close game but Denmark won by ten runs. Denmark won the group with Canada second and both of these two qualified for the semi- finals, Bangladesh being placed third. Sri Lanka then defeated Denmark and Canada in turn to win the tournament. In the 1979‚Äì80 season, Pakistan visited Bangladesh for the first time. It was eight years after the end of the Liberation War but tensions were still evident. The visit was in January during a break in Pakistan's six-Test tour of India. In a two-day match on 2 & 3 January, the Pakistanis played a BCB XI at the M. A. Aziz Stadium in Chittagong. The BCB XI played well though each of the first three innings were ended early by sporting declarations. At tea on the second day, with the BCB XI struggling to chase a target of 211, there was a crowd riot which prematurely terminated the game as a draw.BCB XI v Pakistanis, 1980 Because of the riot, an international match due to start at the National Stadium two days later was cancelled.Bangladesh v Pakistan, 1980 It was not until January 1994 that the Pakistan national team could safely tour Bangladesh. In March 1980, an inter-divisional tournament was staged which included teams from the Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna and Rajshahi divisions. It was the first time that divisional teams were selected and this tournament anticipated the National Cricket League which was launched twenty years later. Fortunately, the riot in 1980 did not deter other tourists and MCC returned to Bangladesh in 1980‚Äì81, followed by the Calcutta and Hyderabad clubs from India in 1981‚Äì82. In the 1982 ICC Trophy, also held in England, Bangladesh reached the semi-finals and lost to the eventual winners, Zimbabwe. This time, there were sixteen teams divided into two groups of eight. Bangladesh were in Group B. Two of their seven matches were abandoned because of bad weather and they had two very narrow wins against Malaysia, by a single run, and Netherlands, by four runs. They had only one defeat and so finished second. The defeat was against group winners Bermuda and it was a heavy one, again exposing Bangladesh's limitations at this stage of their development. Bangladesh were bowled out for only 67 and Bermuda needed just 15.5 overs to win by seven wickets.Bangladesh v Bermuda, ICC Trophy, 1982 The limitations were again exposed in the semi- final when Bangladesh's batsmen could only reach 124, Zimbabwe winning easily by eight wickets.Bangladesh v Zimbabwe, ICC Trophy, 1982 Zimbabwe defeated Bermuda in the final and there was another setback for Bangladesh when they lost the third-place playoff match to Papua New Guinea by three wickets despite an innings of 115 by Yousuf Rahman. In 1983‚Äì84, Bangladesh hosted a tournament for the first time. This was the South East Asian Tournament (limited overs) in which the national team played against Hong Kong, Singapore and a BCB under-25 XI. Bangladesh defeated Hong Kong by 3 wickets in the final to claim the country's first international trophy.Bangladesh v Hong Kong, 1984 The first New Zealand team to visit Bangladesh arrived in 1984‚Äì85. This was the New Zealand Ambassadors who played two limited overs matches in January against Dhaka University and a BCB Under-25 XI. In March, Sri Lanka returned to play a single three-day match against Bangladesh, captained by Gazi Ashraf, in the National Stadium. Bangladesh did well to secure a draw after scoring 139 and 152 for 6 against Sri Lanka's 429 for 9 declared.Bangladesh v Sri Lanka, 1985 In the 1985‚Äì86 season, neighbouring Bengal toured Bangladesh and played four matches against university and BCB teams in February and March. On the basis of their triumph in the South East Asian Tournament two years earlier, Bangladesh were invited to take part in the 1986 Asia Cup, the first edition of this tournament, in Sri Lanka after India withdrew. On 31 March, Bangladesh played their first-ever List A-classified Limited Overs International against Pakistan at the Tyronne Fernando Stadium in Moratuwa. Captained by Gazi Ashraf, Bangladesh were dismissed for 94 and Pakistan won easily by seven wickets. Three days later, Bangladesh lost to Sri Lanka by the same margin. Writing in 1986, Robin Marlar expressed positive views about Bangladeshi cricket including his opinion that the country would, with more encouragement and experience, one day win the ICC Trophy. He also mentioned the large crowds attending matches and the potential for thousands more to play the game.Barclays World of Cricket, p.76. In June and July, Bangladesh competed in the 1986 ICC Trophy, again held in England. As in 1982, there were two qualifying groups and Bangladesh were placed sixth in Group A after a disappointing campaign. 1987 to 1996 Bangladesh hosted the 1988 Asia Cup, competing against India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the first List A classified matches to be played in the country. Bangladesh were the rank outsiders and, as expected, were easily beaten by each of their three opponents. Gazi Ashraf again captained the team. Five of the tournament's seven matches, including the final, were played at the Bangabandhu National Stadium and the other two, both involving Bangladesh themselves, at the M. A. Aziz Stadium in Chittagong. The tournament was won by India who defeated Sri Lanka by six wickets in the final.Wills Asia Cup fixtures, 1988 There were visits by the Hyderabad Blues and Denmark in January and February 1990 to play limited overs games against the BCB XI and club sides only and none of the matches were List A classified. The 1990 ICC Trophy in June was held in the Netherlands and Bangladesh performed with credit, qualifying via two group phases for the semi-final where they were drawn against Zimbabwe and lost by 84 runs. Zimbabwe, who won the tournament, were elected to ICC Full Member status soon afterwards. Bangladesh played in the 1990‚Äì91 Asia Cup in India but were well beaten in their two matches by Sri Lanka and the host nation. In December 1992, Bangladesh hosted a SAARC Quadrangular tournament in which their national team competed against the A-teams of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, all the matches being List A classified and all to be played in Dhaka at the National Stadium. Bangladesh defeated Sri Lanka A by seven wickets in the opening game but then lost by five wickets to Pakistan A. Their third match against India A was interrupted in the ninth over by a crowd riot and abandoned. It was rescheduled three days later but with the situation still volatile, it was cancelled along with the final which would have been India A v Pakistan A.SAARC Quadrangular, 1992 The situation was calmer the following season (1993‚Äì94) when there were short visits by Zimbabwe (November) and Pakistan (January) to play two limited overs matches each against the national team. Being friendlies, these games are not List A-classified. Zimbabwe won their matches by margins of 9 and 13 runs. Pakistan won their two games by 62 runs and 7 wickets. Although the national team were having limited success against opponents with greater experience, domestic cricket in Bangladesh was making progress and expanding. In 1994, the ICC estimated that there were 93,000 people playing cricket in Bangladesh and, as a result, playing standards were rising.Morgan, pp.32‚Äì33. Bangladesh competed in the 1994 ICC Trophy in Kenya and reached the quarter final stage and finished third in their group behind Kenya and the Netherlands. In December 1994, Bangladesh hosted a second SAARC Quadrangular against the A-teams of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, all the matches being List A classified and all to be played in Dhaka at the National Stadium. The problems of 1992 were not repeated and Bangladesh reached the final where they lost to India A by 52 runs. Kenya, one of Bangladesh's main opponents in Associate Member cricket, visited in January 1995 to play five one-day matches. These were not List A classified and Bangladesh won all three of the international fixtures. England's A team visited Bangladesh in February 1995 and played three double innings matches, not first-class, all against the national team. England A won the first two and the third, in which Aminul Islam scored a century, was drawn. Bangladesh were in the 1995 Asia Cup in Sharjah against India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka but lost all three of their first round matches. MCC returned in February 1996 to play a mixture of one-day and three-day matches. 1997 to 2000 The SAARC Quadrangular returned to Bangladesh in February 1997, Pakistan A defeating India A in the final. Bangladesh fared badly and were well beaten in all of their three matches. Disappointing as that was, only two months later Bangladesh had their first international success when they won the 1997 ICC Trophy in Kuala Lumpur. Bangladesh won all five of their matches in the tournament's Group B to reach the quarter-finals, which were two more round- robin groups of four. Bangladesh qualified for the semi-finals defeating Netherlands and Hong Kong while the other game against Ireland was abandoned because of bad weather. In the semi-final, Bangladesh defeated Scotland by 72 runs. They were now playing in the final itself against Kenya and winning by two wickets, scoring the winning run from the last ball of the match. The national team's debut in official first-class cricket was 17‚Äì19 November 1997 at Seddon Park, Hamilton, New Zealand, against a Northern Conference team. Bangladesh were guesting in the 1997‚Äì98 Shell Conference. They lost this match by an innings and 151 runs and were similarly outclassed in their other matches in the tournament.Morgan, p.33. In January 1998, Bangladesh hosted the List A-classified Coca-Cola Silver Jubilee Independence Cup involving India and Pakistan. They lost both their matches and India defeated Pakistan in the final. In 1998‚Äì99, Bangladesh hosted the 1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy (known as the Wills International Cup) during October and November, although it being for Test nations only they could not play themselves but providing neutral venue. South Africa won the tournament. During November, the West Indies A team visited and having played three List A matches against Bangladesh, starting on 12 November the two teams played the first-ever first-class match in Bangladesh (i.e., since independence). West Indies A won by 8 wickets.Bangladesh v West Indies A 1998 The final of the 1998‚Äì99 Asian Test Championship was played at Dhaka in March 1999, Pakistan winning by an innings and 175 runs against Sri Lanka. Later that month, Bangladesh hosted Kenya and Zimbabwe for the List A Meril International Tournament, won convincingly by Zimbabwe. The Bangladesh team played in the Cricket World Cup for the first time, having qualified by winning the 1997 ICC Trophy, for the 1999 tournament in Great Britain. They did not get past the group stage but had a memorable victory by 62 runs over Pakistan. Their progress had received recognition and, on 26 June 2000, Bangladesh became a Full Member of the ICC, which enabled them to play Test cricket. The board officially changed its name to Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and its president Saber Chowdhury described his country's elevation to Test status as \\"the third most historic event in our national life\\". In May/June 2000, Bangladesh had hosted the 2000 Asia Cup, won by Pakistan. In November of that year, Bangladesh played their first-ever Test match against India at the National Stadium, India winning by 9 wickets. 2001 to 2010 The country's main domestic competition, the National Cricket League (NCL), began in 1999‚Äì2000 with teams from each of Bangladesh's (then six) administrative divisions: Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi and Sylhet. Between 2001-2004 Bangladesh suffered from heavy defeats in ODI's In 2000‚Äì01, its second season, the NCL became a first-class competition, sponsored by the Green Delta insurance company, and won by Biman Bangladesh Airlines. The 2000‚Äì01 NCL involved eight teams playing twelve matches each in two groups. Four teams qualified for a final stage in which they each played a further eight games. Group A consisted of Biman Bangladesh Airlines, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Dhaka Division. Group B had Dhaka Metropolis, Khulna, Barisal and Sylhet. In 2001‚Äì02, Ispahani Mirzapore Tea became the sponsor of the NCL in addition to the new One-Day League, introduced as the premier limited overs competition. The NCL was reduced to six teams in 2001‚Äì02 with Dhaka Metropolis and the champions, Biman Bangladesh Airlines, both dropping out. Following creation of Rangpur Division in January 2010 as the country's seventh administrative region, the NCL in 2011‚Äì12 was again expanded to eight teams with the introduction of the Rangpur team and the return of Dhaka Metropolis, although the latter had no settled home venue. They suffered from 5 heavy defeats and 1 no results in 2003 Cricket World Cup 2011 to present The One-Day League was terminated after the 2010‚Äì11 season. The main List A limited overs competition since then is the Dhaka Premier Division, which began in 2013‚Äì14. Bangladesh co-hosted the 2011 Cricket World Cup with India and Sri Lanka. The country was the sole host of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, the final of which was played at the Sher-e- Bangla National Cricket Stadium. In addition, Bangladesh has hosted, in succession, the three Asia Cup tournaments in 2012, 2014 and 2016. Bangladesh also continued to do well in test cricket. They have beaten England and Sri Lanka in 2016-17 session. The win against Sri Lanka was the 100th test match and 9th winning test match for Bangladesh. A few months later they have beaten Australian test team in 1 match and drawn the series. The Bangladesh Cricket League (BCL), another first-class competition, began in 2012‚Äì13. It is played by four teams selected on a zonal basis (North Zone, South Zone, East Zone and Central Zone) to give experience to leading players of a higher standard than the NCL and so prepare them for Test cricket. The winners of the four championships to 2016 have been Central Zone and South Zone winning two apiece. In April 2015, the BCL staged a One-Day League, which was won by East Zone. The Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) is the country's main Twenty20 competition. It was founded in January 2012 and despite problems including match-fixing, it has been a commercial success, said by its promoters to be second only to the Indian Premier League (IPL) in terms of global revenue. Although a 2016 tournament is currently (July 2016) uncertain, it is expected that six franchises will be taking part who are the Barisal Bulls, the Chittagong Vikings, the Comilla Victorians, the Dhaka Dynamites, the Rangpur Riders and the Sylhet Super Stars.

Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214 (2008), was a United States Supreme Court case, upholding the United States's sovereign immunity against tort claims brought when \\"any law enforcement officer\\" loses a person's property. Background Abdus-Shahid M. S. Ali, a federal prisoner in Atlanta, Georgia, was transferred to a prison in Inez, Kentucky. His personal property, packed into two duffel bags, was shipped separately. Upon inspecting his property after arrival at the new prison, he said that $177 worth of property was missing from the bags. Ali filed an administrative claim; relief was denied because Ali had signed a receipt form. Ali filed a lawsuit against the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The case turned on the grammar of part of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), a 1946 law that waives sovereign immunity in some cases so that the federal government may be sued for certain torts. The FTCA states that the waiver of immunity does not apply to claims arising from the detention of property by \\"any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\\" Ali argued that this text had been intended to encompass only law enforcement officers concerned with customs or excise laws. The Bureau of Prisons argued that the word \\"any\\" should be interpreted broadly. Opinion of the Court The Supreme Court ruled against Ali in a 5-4 decision. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, \\"The phrase 'any other law enforcement officer' suggests a broad meaning,\\" and compared the phrasing to the phrasing of other laws, with and without the word \\"any.\\" In his dissent, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that the majority was using \\"wooden reliance\\" on the single word any without considering the rest of the paragraph of the FTCA, and added, \\"If Congress had intended to give sweeping immunity to all federal law enforcement officials from liability for the detention of property, it would not have dropped this phrase onto the end of the statutory clause so as to appear there as something of an afterthought.\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases * Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume * List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Roberts Court External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:2007 in United States case law Category:United States federal sovereign immunity case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court ","title":"Ali v.

History The poem was written in 1880 by Roberts before she had met Elgar, though they were married in the year after the song was written. Roberts offered the poem to Edward when they were engaged, and such was the quality of the work that he put into it‚Äîthe independent brilliant piano part, the voice in turn subtle and heroic‚Äîthat it won the first prize of ¬£5 in a competition organised by the publishers Joseph Williams.

The transform provides an alternative approach to analytic wave front sets of distributions, developed independently by the Japanese mathematicians Mikio Sato, Masaki Kashiwara and Takahiro Kawai in their approach to microlocal analysis. It can also be used to prove the analyticity of solutions of analytic elliptic partial differential equations as well as a version of the classical uniqueness theorem, strengthening the Cauchy‚ÄìKowalevski theorem, due to the Swedish mathematician Erik Albert Holmgren (1872‚Äì1943). Definitions The Fourier transform of a Schwartz function f in S(Rn) is defined by : ({\\\\mathcal F}f)(t) = (2\\\\pi)^{-n / 2} \\\\int_{{\\\\mathbf R}^n}f(x) e^{-ix \\\\cdot t}\\\\, dx. The FBI transform of f is defined for a ‚â• 0 by : ({\\\\mathcal F}_a f)(t,y) = (2\\\\pi)^{-n / 2} \\\\int_{{\\\\mathbf R}^n}f(x)e^{-a x-y^2/2} e^{-ix \\\\cdot t}\\\\, dx. Thus, when a = 0, it essentially coincides with the Fourier transform. The same formulas can be used to define the Fourier and FBI transforms of tempered distributions in S'(Rn). Inversion formula The Fourier inversion formula : f(x)= {\\\\mathcal F}^2 f(-x) allows a function f to be recovered from its Fourier transform. In particular :f(x)= (2\\\\pi)^{-n/2}\\\\int_{{\\\\mathbf R}^n} e^{i t \\\\cdot x}{\\\\mathcal F}(f)(t) \\\\, dt Similarly, at a positive value of a, f(0) can be recovered from the FBI transform of f(x) by the inversion formula :f(x)= (2\\\\pi)^{-n/2}\\\\int_{{\\\\mathbf R}^n} e^{i t \\\\cdot x}e^{ax-y^2/2}{\\\\mathcal F}_a (f)(t,y) \\\\, dt Criterion for local analyticity Bros and Iagolnitzer showed that a distribution f is locally equal to a real analytic function at y, in the direction Œæ if and only if its FBI transform satisfies an inequality of the form :({\\\\mathcal F}_{\\\\xi}f)(\\\\xi,y) \\\\le C e^{-\\\\varepsilon \\\\xi}, for Œæ sufficiently large. Holmgren's uniqueness theorem A simple consequence of the Bros and Iagolnitzer characterisation of local analyticity is the following regularity result of Lars H√∂rmander and Mikio Sato (). Theorem. Let P be an elliptic partial differential operator with analytic coefficients defined on an open subset X of Rn. If Pf is analytic in X, then so too is f. When \\"analytic\\" is replaced by \\"smooth\\" in this theorem, the result is just Hermann Weyl's classical lemma on elliptic regularity, usually proved using Sobolev spaces (Warner 1983). It is a special case of more general results involving the analytic wave front set (see below), which imply Holmgren's classical strengthening of the Cauchy‚ÄìKowalevski theorem on linear partial differential equations with real analytic coefficients. In modern language, Holmgren's uniquess theorem states that any distributional solution of such a system of equations must be analytic and therefore unique, by the Cauchy‚ÄìKowalevski theorem. The analytic wave front set The analytic wave front set or singular spectrum WFA(f) of a distribution f (or more generally of a hyperfunction) can be defined in terms of the FBI transform () as the complement of the conical set of points (x, Œª Œæ) (Œª > 0) such that the FBI transform satisfies the Bros‚ÄìIagolnitzer inequality :({\\\\mathcal F}_{\\\\xi}f)(\\\\xi,y) \\\\le C e^{-\\\\varepsilon \\\\xi}, for y the point at which one would like to test for analyticity, and Œæ sufficiently large and pointing in the direction one would like to look for the wave front, that is, the direction at which the singularity at y, if it exists, propagates. J.M. Bony (, ) proved that this definition coincided with other definitions introduced independently by Sato, Kashiwara and Kawai and by H√∂rmander. If P is an mth order linear differential operator having analytic coefficients : P =\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha\\\\le m} a_\\\\alpha(x) D^\\\\alpha, with principal symbol : \\\\sigma_P(x,\\\\xi) = \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha= m} a_\\\\alpha(x) \\\\xi^\\\\alpha, and characteristic variety :{\\\\rm char}\\\\, P =\\\\\\\\{(x,\\\\xi): \\\\xi e0, \\\\, \\\\sigma_P(x,\\\\xi) =0\\\\\\\\}, then * \\\\operatorname{WF}_A(Pf) \\\\subseteq \\\\operatorname{WF}_A(f) * \\\\operatorname{WF}_A(f) \\\\subseteq \\\\operatorname{WF}_A(Pf) \\\\cup \\\\operatorname{char} P.

Its main products are wire and stranded electrical cable made from its Copperweld brand copper-clad steel (\\"CCS\\") or copper-clad aluminium (\\"CCA\\"). In addition to its American operations, Copperweld maintains a production facility in Telford, England, and a distribution hub in Li√®ge, Belgium. History Beginnings A group of engineers (S. E. Bramer, Jacob Roth, F. R. S. Kaplan, Simon Loeb and William Smith, Sr.) in the Pittsburgh industrial town of Rankin, Pennsylvania first created a permanent metallurgical bond between copper and steel in 1915. This bond originally was made under a molten weld process. Their product, a CCS wire patented under the brand name Copperweld, was soon adopted as an alternative to solid copper wire in many conductor applications, particularly those where copper would be too ductile or would not offer the breaking strength of steel. The original use, however, was for watch springs: the copper cladding prevented corrosion. The company was founded as the Copper- Clad Steel Company, but in 1924, changed its name to the Copperweld Steel Company. In 1927, the company installed itself in a former axe factory in Glassport, Pennsylvania. Copperweld Steel went public for the first time in 1929, shortly before the onset of the Great Depression, but its shares were eventually withdrawn. The United States government was the company's major client throughout the Depression and World War II, and its patronage is largely responsible for keeping the company solvent in that time of severe economic downturn. The company was listed on the New York Curb Exchange in 1937, and on the New York Stock Exchange in 1940. It would continue to trade on the NYSE until 1999. In 1939, Copperweld would open its second factory in Warren, Ohio, manufacturing steel billets. Post-war growth and diversification After the war, the resurgence of the American economy helped Copperweld thrive. The company's management offices relocated from Glassport to downtown Pittsburgh soon after the war. Although there was considerable investment in existing divisions, acquisition became another of the company's major growth paths. In 1951, the company acquired the Flexo Wire Co. of Oswego, New York. The next year, Copperweld entered into the steel tube manufacturing business with the acquisition of Ohio Seamless Tubing Company of Shelby, Ohio. In 1957, the company merged with stainless steel finisher Superior Steel Company, but sold off the division after five years of poor performance. In conjunction with Battelle Memorial Institute, the company developed a second bimetallic product line, an aluminum-covered steel wire that it branded as Alumoweld¬Æ in 1959. The new product was successful, and the company engaged in its first international joint venture in 1966, with the creation of the Japan Alumoweld Company of Numazu, Japan. Copperweld's stake was 45%, with the remainder owned by Japanese wire and cable manufacturer Fujikura Ltd. In 1972, Copperweld Steel Co. acquired the Chicago-based Regal Tube division of Lear-Siegler. A new name Now truly diversified, the company changed its name in 1973 to Copperweld Corporation. The company expanded into the primary and secondary metallurgical products market, offering a diversified product range that included steel pipe and tube; bimetallic wire, strand and strip; steel bars and plates; solder and skiving, and employed thousands at multiple facilities in the United States, Canada, Japan and Britain. The bimetallic process moved beyond simple copper and steel, and eventually also combined metals and alloys such as aluminum, tin, brass, gold, nickel and silver. In 1974, the company's third foray into bimetallics was realized when the company opened a CCA wire manufacturing plant in Fayetteville, Tennessee. That division, Copperweld Southern, would go on to become the focus of the company's bimetallic wire operation. Takeover French holding company Im√©tal S.A. (today known as Imerys), owned by the Rothschild family, acquired controlling interest of Copperweld Corporation in 1975. Im√©tal's acquisition of Copperweld represented the first hostile takeover of an American company by a foreign entity. Im√©tal vowed not to interfere with the theretofore successful company's direction. In 1978, the company expanded its bimetallic wire production to Campinas, Brazil in a joint venture with Erico International Corp. Copperweld would buy the entire operation from its partner just three years later. Also in 1978 the firm announced the layoff of its Glassport, Pennsylvania facility along with 548 full-time jobs, prompting the mayor of Pittsburgh and the head of the RIDC to have a 2-hour meeting with company executives in an attempt to save the facility. A new division and revenue stream were created in 1980 with the advent of Copperweld Energy, which bought stakes in Houston-based Guardian Oil Company. The ostensible purpose of Copperweld's involvement in the energy business was to drill for natural gas on the grounds of (or near) its operations in Ohio and Pennsylvania, to ensure a steady supply for its factories. That same year, the company acquired American Seamless Tubing of Baltimore, Maryland. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Copperweld in a landmark antitrust case, Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., that a parent company is incapable of conspiracy with a wholly owned subsidiary. The severe steel crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s hit Copperweld hard. The venerable Glassport facility would close entirely in 1983. In 1986, the Oswego fine wire division was shut down. Both operations were relocated to Copperweld Southern in Fayetteville, largely due to cheaper labor costs in the South. Two Copperwelds In a bold move to shed the company of its crippled steel manufacturing operations and concentrate on fabricated steel products, Im√©tal spun off Copperweld's Warren, Ohio operation into a separate publicly traded company in 1986. That company, CSC Industries, would continue to operate as the Copperweld Steel Company, causing confusion. For some time, two \\"Copperwelds\\" existed. However, Im√©tal's gamble paid off. Copperweld Corporation returned to profitability just one year after the spin- off of CSC Industries, which, by contrast, was doomed. The newly formed company never turned a profit in its entire history, and went bankrupt in 1993. The assets of CSC Industries were acquired in a bidding war by Ohio- based Hamlin Holdings in 1995, and they discontinued use of the Copperweld name. The late 1980s saw a much healthier Copperweld Corporation divest of its operations in Brazil and sell its tubing operation in Baltimore. Expansion was again on the horizon, with the 1988 announcement of a $90 million upgrade to its plant in Shelby, Ohio, and the construction of another tube plant in Birmingham, Alabama. The company also bought National Standard Company's Copperply division, giving it control of a competing brand in bimetallic wire. In 1989, Copperweld and Fujikura announce a second joint venture together, the United States Alumoweld Company, to be located in Duncan, South Carolina. In 1992, the Copperweld Corporation divested itself of the Alumoweld¬Æ business altogether, selling its shares and the rights to the brand to Fujikura. Further growth by acquisition continued in the company's tube sector in the 1990s as it acquired Piqua, Ohio-based Miami Industries in 1993 and two Canadian steel tube companies, Standard Tube Canada and Sonco Steel Tube in 1997. That same year, the Shelby plant was the subject of another important expansion. In 1998, the company announced the building of a stainless steel tube plant in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. The bimetallic wire division also prospered, with a drastic increase in demand of bimetallic wires for the cellular telephony boom. In 1995, the company bought Metallon Engineered Materials Corporation of Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1995. There was a major expansion of the Fayetteville facility in 1997, and it purchased Sayton Fine Wires of Telford, England in 1998. LTV In 1999, Cleveland, Ohio-based LTV Steel acquired Copperweld Corporation from Im√©tal for $650 million, and the subsidiary became known as LTV Copperweld. At that time, the company was the largest producer of structural steel tubing in North America with 23 plants and employing 3,500 people. But LTV was drowning in debt, and at the end of 2000, LTV, along with 48 subsidiaries, including Copperweld, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Under the order of conservators, LTV's various subsidiaries were sold off. But because the LTV Copperweld division maintained profitable operations throughout LTV's bankruptcy proceeding, it was able to secure separate debtor- in-possession financing through GE Commercial Finance. In late 2003, LTV Copperweld emerged from bankruptcy. Dofasco Dofasco (today a division of Arcelor Mittal) acquired most of the LTV Copperweld assets, including 50% of the bimetallic wire division, which would in turn be sold to a private investor David S. Jones for $14.2 million in 2006 and operated as Copperweld Bimetallics LLC. It was the only division of the previous conglomerate to continue to operate under the Copperweld name, and kept the established brand as a registered trademark for its copper-clad steel conductors. Fushi In August 2007, however, the owner sold the company for US$22.5 million to Fushi International, founded by Li Fu in 2001. The acquisition is significant because it represents the first major investment in the state of Tennessee for a mainland Chinese company. By acquiring Copperweld, it not only opened up a worldwide distribution channel, it also gained product diversification by the presence of CCS wire in its new subsidiary's lineup. Three months later, Fushi International was listed on the Nasdaq, and changed its name to Fushi Copperweld, capilizing on the established brand name in the west. A group of investors headed by Chairman Fu Li delisted from the Nasdaq on December 27, 2012, returning the company to private ownership gain. Kinderhook In October 2019, Kinderhook Industries LLC announced its acquisition of Copperweld, citing the company's proprietary manufacturing and differentiated products that provide an array of compelling growth avenues to pursue, particularly in the automotive. Kinderhook is a private investment firm that manages over $3.1 billion of committed capital.

The metallic combinations are engineered to provide the benefits of two disparate materials. CCS, or copper-clad steel wire, provides the strength of steel with the conductivity of copper. In 1963, the original molten-weld process for Copperweld¬Æ CCS wire was abandoned in favor of a pressure-rolling process, which is still used today. In the case of CCA, or copper-clad aluminum, the key benefit over solid copper is lighter weight and flexibility. In late 2013, Copperweld Bimetallics LLC, the company's American subsidiary, purchased most of the assets of its biggest American competitor, the Bimetals division of CommScope, relocating their equipment from Statesville, North Carolina to Copperweld's plant in Fayetteville, Tennessee.

The history of British Rail's corporate liveries is quite complex. Although from the mid-1960s to the 1980s the organisation was associated with \\"Rail Blue\\", a number of other schemes were also used, especially when it was split into operating units or \\"sectors\\" in the mid-1980s. Pre-corporate liveries At the formation of British Railways on 1 January 1948, early diesel and electric locos and the gas turbine locomotives 18000 and 18100 were already painted black with aluminium trim, but by the late 1950s this had been superseded by the same shade of green that was used on express passenger steam locomotives, although some locomotives were painted in a two-tone Brunswick and Sherwood green livery, and Southern Region electric locomotives were painted a light shade of malachite green. Multiple units were also generally green, although this tended to be a lighter and bluer shade compared to the colour used on steam and diesel locomotives. Corridor coaching stock was originally trialled in carmine and white (nicknamed Plum and Spilt Milk) before Crimson Lake and Cream livery (nicknamed Blood and Custard) was adopted across the network; non-corridor stock was painted plain Crimson Lake. In 1956 an all-over darker maroon, which more closely resembled the pre- nationalisation LMS livery, was re-introduced, except for the Southern Region, where locomotive-hauled stock was generally painted 'coaching stock' green (from July 1956-on) and a small number of express carriages on the Western Region which were in traditional GWR-style chocolate and cream. With the reorganisation of British Railways in the mid-1960s, a complete break with the past was signalled by the introduction of a blue and grey livery which dominated all passenger rolling stock until the mid-1980s, when a new Intercity livery (dark grey and beige with a red and white waistband) was introduced along with a number of regional colour schemes. Early liveries Class 83 electric locomotive No.E3035 in Electric Blue livery Blue Pullman in the original Nanking blue livery at Bristol Bath Road depot in October 1965 The standard livery for most British Railways steam locomotives was black, often with a thin red, cream and grey \\"lining\\" (trim), while express passenger locomotives were not painted Brunswick Green, as is often incorrectly stated, (This had been the livery of the old Great Western Railway). But were in fact painted in British Standards:BS224 \\"Deep Bronze Green\\" also known as: \\"Land Rover Deep Bronze Green LR001\\" with orange and black lining. This error in colour identification comes from an article and question published in a Model Railway Magazine in the 1950s, where the responding editor made the error, and it has frequently been repeated since then. This has been confirmed by records held at the National Railway Museum. All Class 42 \\"Warship\\" class diesels were delivered in green but some Class 52s were delivered in maroon to match the then-standard coaching stock livery. This livery suited these diesel hydraulic classes, and allowed the Western Region to once again show a degree of independence; it was not applied to any other diesel or electric classes (other than the Class 42/43 \\"Warships\\"). The 25 kV electric locomotives were painted from new in a striking shade of bright blue which was known as \\"Electric Blue\\". They retained this livery for some years, before being painted in Rail Blue when that became the norm. In 1964, as part of a plan to develop a new corporate image for British Railways, a number of experiments were tried; *Two Class 31 diesels were painted in trial liveries. No.D5578 was painted in an unlined 'Light Electric blue', and No.D5579 was painted in a colour variously described as 'Bronze Gold' and 'Golden Ochre'. * The first Class 52 \\"Western\\" class, No.D1000 Western Enterprise was painted in a pale brown livery known as 'Desert Sand' livery when first delivered in 1961. * Another Class 52, No.D1015 Western Champion was delivered in another, darker yellow/brown colour described as 'Golden Ochre', though somewhat different from that applied to D5579. These non- standard liveried \\"Western\\" diesel hydraulics were also fitted with the cast aluminium lion and wheel emblem that was standard issue on the 25 kV electric locomotives.  Coaching stock from 1948  British Railways coaches in the crimson and cream livery used from 1949 Discussions on the livery for British Railways coaching stock in 1948 eventually settled on a network-wide two-tone livery of crimson lake and cream for corridor coaches, with all-over crimson lake being used for local, non-corridor stock. The colours were chosen to be different from those of any of the \\"Big Four\\" pre-nationalisation railway companies while retaining a traditional aspect. However many people were not happy with the loss of the traditional \\"historic\\" regional colour schemes as used by the former private companies.  The second phase  British Railways Mark 1 coaches in early 1960s maroon livery From 1956 there was a move toward the return of regional colour schemes. The Midland, Eastern and Scottish regions adopted a maroon livery which strongly resembled that of the former London Midland and Scottish Railway but the Western Region returned some of its coaches that were used on named express trains to a chocolate/cream scheme similar to that used by the GWR before nationalisation and from July 1956 the Southern Region began using a 'coaching stock' green that was somewhat darker than the malachite green colour of the old Southern Railway. For cost reasons, liveries were usually changed piecemeal, when coaches came in for scheduled maintenance. Coaches from different regions could also often find themselves coupled together. Due to the consequent muddle of liveries, many trains began to get an untidy if not tatty appearance which added to the run-down image of the railway. The rebranding of British Railways to British Rail on 1 January 1965 was coupled with the introduction of an entirely new national livery.  XP64  Virgin CrossCountry 47853 in a re-creation of the XP64 livery in 2001 A mock-up for the British Railways Mark 2 stock was displayed at the Design Centre, 28 Haymarket, London, (the showrooms of the Council of Industrial Design) in 1964. This included many of the features which were later incorporated in the Mark 2, and trialled in an experimental train designated XP64. This mock-up was shown in an orange and grey livery, which, however, never appeared on rolling stock in service. The XP64 train was used to test technology and carriage arrangements for the planned Mark 2 coaches. The coaches for the XP64 train were painted in a slightly lighter version of what would eventually become Rail Blue, with a Pale Ivory stripe centred on the passenger windows, and brown underframe. One locomotive, Class 47 No.D1733, was painted to match the coaching stock. In 2001, as passenger work for diesel locomotives came to an end on the rail system, a number of Virgin CrossCountry Class 47s were painted in \\"heritage\\" liveries that they had carried in the past, including the former D1733, now 47853, which once again carried a near-correct version of the XP64 livery.  Rail Blue  Class 31 No.31018 in the standard Rail Blue colour scheme Eventually, it was decided to standardise on a colour which became known as Rail Blue. Introduced in 1965, and also known as \\"Monastral Blue\\", the colour was defined by British Standards BR28/6001 (Airless spray finish) and BR28/5321 (Brush finish). It was a dark, greyish blue tone which hid the effects of dirt well. The colour often appears inaccurately in photographs, generally appearing brighter and bluer than the real colour. In the early years the colour faded quite badly, becoming lighter and paler with time although this problem had been overcome by the late 1970s. United Kingdom paint code RAL5020 (\\"Ocean Blue\\") is a good match to Rail Blue. There is also a British Standard paint colour BS381C 114 called Rail Blue which was introduced in 1964. The new British Rail \\"double arrow\\" symbol on locomotives (or leading vehicle as was the case on multiple unit stock) and the vehicle number and other ancillary markings written in the Rail Alphabet typeface were other integral parts of the livery.  Locomotives  This colour was applied to all diesel and electric locomotives, with the exception of the ends, which were painted yellow to improve visibility, and the underframes and buffer beams which were painted black; the paints being to BSS 2660-0.003 and BSS 2660-9.103 respectively. As Rail Blue was introduced, the last locomotive recorded as being outshopped in a previous livery was Class 43 D838 Rapid which left Swindon Works in August 1968 in maroon. The Vale of Rheidol Railway remained steam operated past the general end of steam traction in 1968, and accordingly the three remaining Vale of Rheidol Railway locomotives received the Rail Blue colour scheme, being all blue with black smokebox and red bufferbeam, and no yellow warning panel.  Coaches and multiple units  Class 501 train in Rail Blue calls at Harrow and Wealdstone Class 416 train in British Rail blue/grey livery calls at Dalston Kingsland station Corridor coaching stock and certain express multiple unit classes were painted in Rail Blue with a 44-inch Pearl Grey (BS 2660-9-095) horizontal panel centred vertically on the main windows, outlined by a narrow white line. This grey panel finished just short of the end of the coach leaving a small amount of Rail Blue which then continued round onto the end of the coach. Roofs were Dark Grey and underframes originally brown, but later black. Non-corridor coaching stock and other multiple units received all-over Rail Blue until about 1980, when most received the same blue/grey livery as corridor coaching stock. The 4REP and 3/4TC EMUs were a notable oddity, initially receiving all- over Rail Blue despite being express corridor stock. They were repainted into blue/grey in the early 1970s. From 1974, some DMU sets, after being refurbished, were painted white with a wide blue band under the windows and full yellow ends. Swansea in 1967 From 1966 until withdrawal, Pullman Coaches were also painted in the reversal of the normal coach livery, with the blue and grey areas transposed. The Blue Pullman sets retained their livery of Nanking Blue (albeit with full yellow ends) until 1969 when they were repainted in the reversed grey and blue livery.  Local variations  Diesel Class 47 loco 47100 with the trademark Stratford T.M.D. grey roof In 1977 two Class 47 locomotives, 47163 and 47164, were painted by Stratford TMD with silver roofs and other decorations including a full body height Union Flag on each side, in celebration of Queen Elizabeth II's silver jubilee. Several other Class 47 locomotives, some Class 31s, and even some DMU cabs, were subsequently also painted by Stratford with grey roofs, the variation becoming something of a trademark for the depot. After this time small variations in the Rail Blue livery became much more common. Several Class 31 locomotives received white waist stripes, these being particularly associated with the depots at Old Oak Common and Finsbury Park. Also on the Eastern Region, Class 55 Deltic locomotives based at Finsbury Park acquired white surrounds to their cab windows. Eastfield TMD staff near Glasgow also embellished a few examples of the class 37/0's allocated to the depot with a lower bodyside white stripe in the mid-80s but were told to stop doing it and repaint the ones they'd already done back to the standard blue livery by the BR hierarchy.  Moving away from Rail Blue  A BR HST set in original InterCity 125 'Yellow and Blue' livery Class 50 No.50035 The first break in the uniformity of Rail Blue came in 1976 with the introduction of the first InterCity 125 (HST). The distinctive angular shape of the HST power cars did not lend itself to applying yellow on the leading face, so the yellow was wrapped around and extended along the side of each power car, although the coaches retained the usual Rail Blue coaching stock livery. In 1978 the British Railways Board began planning a new livery for the future, and in that August Class 56 diesel locomotive 56036 was painted to test a modified livery of all-over Rail Blue with the entire loco front in bright yellow to improve visibility, this extending down the sides of the loco to the rear of the cab windows which were, in turn, outlined in black. This livery was known as Large Logo livery as each side of the locomotive was dominated by a full body height BR double arrow symbol, and had the loco number prominently displayed at twice the previous size. This livery was well received by enthusiasts but as the Class 56s only hauled freight, it was decided to extend the experiment to a passenger loco. Thus Class 47 47170 County of Norfolk, allocated to Stratford and a regular performer on trains between Liverpool Street and Norwich, was painted in Large Logo livery. Initially new locos were still painted in the traditional Rail Blue livery, but starting with Class 56 number 56084 the new Large Logo version was standard on new locos delivered to BR. After this date, the passenger versions of Class 37 and 47, as well as Class 50, were routinely outshopped in this livery.  Sectorisation   InterCity  Locomotive 47553 in InterCity livery, contrasting with the Rail Blue of leading locomotive 86402 Following the introduction of the Advanced Passenger Train in 1983, a similar livery to the APT's (dark grey on the upper body, and light beige on the lower, with two stripes of red and white separating them) was experimentally applied to two HST sets and the coaches operating the Gatwick Express service between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport. This was referred to as the InterCity Executive livery as the sets used were dedicated to operating morning/evening services operated for businesspeople. Despite the InterCity brand having been introduced in 1966, in 1985 the word 'Executive' was dropped and the livery was applied to all coaches and many locomotives used on InterCity services. London and South East 4 CEP electric multiple unit in Jaffa Cake livery on the 1066 electric service to in 1986. Launched as the London & South East Sector \\"Express Livery\\" this was a short- lived scheme which appeared on only a few units and routes before the advent of Network SouthEast's \\"toothpaste\\" red white and blue striped livery. The livery comprised brown upper panels with a colour described variously as \\"biscuit\\" or \\"fawn\\" along the lower panels and separated by a broad orange band. The livery derived its nickname from a perceived resemblance to the internal appearance of a Jaffa Cake. Variants where the band was blue (outer suburban) or green (inner suburban) instead of orange were planned, but never implemented. The livery was applied only to some \\"Clacton\\" units on the former Eastern Region and to a few of Classes 411 (4Cep), 419 (MLV) and 421 (4Cig) on the former Southern Region. The Class 309 units worked between and , occasionally also to and and later upon transfer saw the livery briefly appear around Manchester and Birmingham. The Southern Region types worked mostly on the / - via / Dover and routes and on the Victoria / - / / Hastings via routes. The new livery was used with the introduction of the Hastings Line electrification in 1986 to promote new electric trains on that line. The anniversary of the Battle of Hastings which took place in 1066 was also used in publicity for the line. Due to the small number of units repainted it was common to see trains with two or more units in different liveries.  Network SouthEast  Faded Network SouthEast livery On 10 June 1986, British Rail launched Network SouthEast, an organisation designed to cut across the traditional regional boundaries and deliver a co-ordinated train service for London and the surrounding region. For this new venture a new livery - a paler shade of blue than Rail Blue, with three stripes of white, red and grey - was created with Class 47 No.47573 The London Standard painted in the new livery specifically for the launch ceremony. As well as rolling stock and multiple units, a number of Class 47 and Class 50 locomotives dedicated to Network SouthEast passenger services were painted in this livery. A later version made minor changes to the livery, the main one of which was to darken the main shade of blue used. This livery is also often nicknamed 'toothpaste livery' by rail enthusiasts due to the multicoloured stripes resembling striped toothpaste. ScotRail ScotRail livery on 47702 at York station in 1988 ScotRail was the brand name under which British Rail operated passenger services in Scotland and cross border services to Northern England and London. A corporate livery was created for major express services in Scotland, which effectively consisted of the InterCity livery with the red stripe replaced by a light blue one.  Regional Railways  Close-up of Regional Railways livery and logo Upon sectorisation, most secondary passenger routes which did not fall under the InterCity or Network SouthEast banner were re-designated as Regional Railways (originally Provincial). A livery, similar to ScotRail but with the upper dark grey bodyside replaced with a dark blue, was created. A number of sets of coaching stock and a handful of locomotives received the livery, as well as all new multiple units and some existing ones. Scottish rolling stock not covered by the ScotRail livery (generally those on secondary services) received the Regional Railways livery, but with \\"ScotRail\\" branding.  Rail Express Systems  No.47757 carrying Rail Express System livery Rail Express Systems was the sector of British Rail responsible for transport of mail and parcels traffic. Its rolling stock initially carried the standard Rail Blue (or blue and grey) livery but in 1992, it introduced a new livery of red and grey, with pale blue and grey flashes. The livery was carried on the rolling stock, but also on a number of locomotives which were dedicated to mail and parcels traffic, mainly of Classes 47 and 90.  Railfreight and associated liveries  58001 displaying the original Railfreight livery Railfreight livery, a colour scheme specifically for freight locomotives, was unveiled when Class 58 58001 drove through a plastic screen at Doncaster Works on 9 December 1982. While this livery had much in common with the \\"Large Logo\\" version of Rail Blue livery, including the yellow cabs and larger logo and numbers on the bodyside, the main colour was grey rather than blue. A later version added a red stripe along the lower edge of the locomotive bodyside. When British Rail operations were divided into sectors in the mid-1980s, prior to privatisation, a new version of the Railfreight livery emerged giving the sectors individual identities. Consisting of three shades of grey and thus known as \\"triple grey Railfreight\\", the livery included logos on the sides and cabs of locomotives indicating which sector they belonged to. For locomotives used on internal British Rail duties, a separate livery of a plain darker grey was created. This was later modified for locomotives allocated to the Civil Engineer's department to include a yellow stripe on the upper bodyside, the resulting livery being known as \\"Dutch\\" due to its similarity to the corporate colours of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen.

Illusory superiority is one of many positive illusions, relating to the self, that are evident in the study of intelligence, the effective performance of tasks and tests, and the possession of desirable personal characteristics and personality traits. The term illusory superiority was first used by the researchers Van Yperen and Buunk, in 1991. The phenomenon is also known as the above-average effect, the superiority bias, the leniency error, the sense of relative superiority, the primus inter pares effect, and the Lake Wobegon effect, named after the fictional town where all the children are above average. A vast majority of the literature on illusory superiority originates from studies on participants in the United States. However, research that only investigates the effects in one specific population is severely limited as this may not be a true representation of human psychology. More recent research investigating self-esteem in other countries suggests that illusory superiority depends on culture. Some studies indicate that East Asians tend to underestimate their own abilities in order to improve themselves and get along with others.  Explanations   Better-than-average heuristic  Alicke and Govorun proposed the idea that, rather than individuals consciously reviewing and thinking about their own abilities, behaviors and characteristics and comparing them to those of others, it is likely that people instead have what they describe as an \\"automatic tendency to assimilate positively-evaluated social objects toward ideal trait conceptions\\". For example, if an individual evaluated themselves as honest, they would be likely to then exaggerate their characteristic towards their perceived ideal position on a scale of honesty. Importantly, Alicke noted that this ideal position is not always the top of the scale; for example, with honesty, someone who is always brutally honest may be regarded as rude‚Äîthe ideal is a balance, perceived differently by different individuals.  Egocentrism  Another explanation for how the better-than-average effect works is egocentrism. This is the idea that an individual places greater importance and significance on their own abilities, characteristics, and behaviors than those of others. Egocentrism is therefore a less overtly self-serving bias. According to egocentrism, individuals will overestimate themselves in relation to others because they believe that they have an advantage that others do not have, as an individual considering their own performance and another's performance will consider their performance to be better, even when they are in fact equal. Kruger (1999) found support for the egocentrism explanation in his research involving participant ratings of their ability on easy and difficult tasks. It was found that individuals were consistent in their ratings of themselves as above the median in the tasks classified as \\"easy\\" and below the median in the tasks classified as \\"difficult\\", regardless of their actual ability. In this experiment the better-than-average effect was observed when it was suggested to participants that they would be successful, but also a worse-than-average effect was found when it was suggested that participants would be unsuccessful.  Focalism  Yet another explanation for the better-than- average effect is \\"focalism\\", the idea that greater significance is placed on the object that is the focus of attention. Most studies of the better-than- average effect place greater focus on the self when asking participants to make comparisons (the question will often be phrased with the self being presented before the comparison target‚Äî\\"compare yourself to the average person\\"). According to focalism this means that the individual will place greater significance on their own ability or characteristic than that of the comparison target. This also means that in theory if, in an experiment on the better-than-average effect, the questions were phrased so that the self and other were switched (e.g., \\"compare the average peer to yourself\\") the better- than-average effect should be lessened. Research into focalism has focused primarily on optimistic bias rather than the better-than-average effect. However, two studies found a decreased effect of optimistic bias when participants were asked to compare an average peer to themselves, rather than themselves to an average peer. Windschitl, Kruger & Simms (2003) have conducted research into focalism, focusing specifically on the better-than- average effect, and found that asking participants to estimate their ability and likelihood of success in a task produced results of decreased estimations when they were asked about others' chances of success rather than their own.  Noisy mental information processing  A 2012 Psychological Bulletin suggests that illusory superiority, as well as other biases, can be explained by an information-theoretic generative mechanism that assumes observation (a noisy conversion of objective evidence) into subjective estimates (judgment). The study suggests that the underlying cognitive mechanism is similar to the noisy mixing of memories that cause the conservatism bias or overconfidence: re-adjustment of estimates of our own performance after our own performance are adjusted differently than the re-adjustments regarding estimates of others' performances. Estimates of the scores of others are even more conservative (more influenced by the previous expectation) than our estimates of our own performance (more influenced by the new evidence received after giving the test). The difference in the conservative bias of both estimates (conservative estimate of our own performance, and even more conservative estimate of the performance of others) is enough to create illusory superiority. Since mental noise is a sufficient explanation that is much simpler and more straightforward than any other explanation involving heuristics, behavior, or social interaction, the Occam's razor principle argues in its favor as the underlying generative mechanism (it is the hypothesis which makes the fewest assumptions).  Selective recruitment  Selective recruitment is the notion that an individual selects their own strengths and the other's weaknesses when making peer comparisons, in order that they appear better on the whole. This theory was first tested by Weinstein (1980); however, this was in an experiment relating to optimistic bias, rather than the better-than-average effect. The study involved participants rating certain behaviors as likely to increase or decrease the chance of a series of life events happening to them. It was found that individuals showed less optimistic bias when they were allowed to see others' answers. Perloff and Fetzer (1986) suggested that when making peer comparisons on a specific characteristic, an individual chooses a comparison target‚Äîthe peer to whom he is being compared‚Äîwith lower abilities. To test this theory, Perloff and Fetzer asked participants to compare themselves to specific comparison targets like a close friend, and found that illusory superiority decreased when they were told to envision a specific person rather than vague constructs like \\"the average peer\\". However these results are not completely reliable and could be affected by the fact that individuals like their close friends more than an \\"average peer\\" and may as a result rate their friend as being higher than average, therefore the friend would not be an objective comparison target.  \\"Self versus aggregate\\" comparisons  This idea, put forward by Giladi and Klar, suggests that when making comparisons any single member of a group will tend to evaluate themselves to rank above that group's statistical mean performance level or the median performance level of its members. For example, if an individual is asked to assess their own skill at driving compared to the rest of the group, they are likely to rate themself as an above-average driver. Furthermore, the majority of the group is likely to rate themselves as above average. Research has found this effect in many different areas of human performance and has even generalized it beyond individuals' attempts to draw comparisons involving themselves. Findings of this research therefore suggest that rather than individuals evaluating themselves as above average in a self-serving manner, the better-than-average effect is actually due to a general tendency to evaluate any single person or object as better than average.  Non-social explanations  The better- than-average effect may not have wholly social origins‚Äîjudgments about inanimate objects suffer similar distortions.  Neuroimaging  The degree to which people view themselves as more desirable than the average person links to reduced activation in their orbitofrontal cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. This is suggested to link to the role of these areas in processing \\"cognitive control\\".  Effects in different situations  Illusory superiority has been found in individuals' comparisons of themselves with others in a variety of aspects of life, including performance in academic circumstances (such as class performance, exams and overall intelligence), in working environments (for example in job performance), and in social settings (for example in estimating one's popularity, or the extent to which one possesses desirable personality traits, such as honesty or confidence), and in everyday abilities requiring particular skill. For illusory superiority to be demonstrated by social comparison, two logical hurdles have to be overcome. One is the ambiguity of the word \\"average\\". It is logically possible for nearly all of the set to be above the mean if the distribution of abilities is highly skewed. For example, the mean number of legs per human being is slightly lower than two because some people have fewer than two and almost none have more. Hence experiments usually compare subjects to the median of the peer group, since by definition it is impossible for a majority to exceed the median. A further problem in inferring inconsistency is that subjects might interpret the question in different ways, so it is logically possible that a majority of them are, for example, more generous than the rest of the group each on \\"their own understanding\\" of generosity. This interpretation is confirmed by experiments which varied the amount of interpretive freedom. As subjects evaluated themselves on a specific, well-defined attribute, illusory superiority remains.  Academic ability, job performance, lawsuits going to trial, and stock trading  In a survey of faculty at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln, 68% rated themselves in the top 25% for teaching ability, and 94% rated themselves as above average. In a similar survey, 87% of Master of Business Administration students at Stanford University rated their academic performance as above the median.\\"It's Academic.\\" 2000. Stanford GSB Reporter, 24 April, pp.14‚Äì5. via Illusory superiority has also explained phenomena such as the large amount of stock market trading (as each trader thinks they are the best, and most likely to succeed), and the number of lawsuits that go to trial (because, due to illusory superiority, many lawyers have an inflated belief that they will win a case).  Cognitive tasks  In Kruger and Dunning's experiments participants were given specific tasks (such as solving logic problems, analyzing grammar questions, and determining whether jokes were funny), and were asked to evaluate their performance on these tasks relative to the rest of the group, enabling a direct comparison of their actual and perceived performance. Results were divided into four groups depending on actual performance and it was found that all four groups evaluated their performance as above average, meaning that the lowest-scoring group (the bottom 25%) showed a very large illusory superiority bias. The researchers attributed this to the fact that the individuals who were worst at performing the tasks were also worst at recognizing skill in those tasks. This was supported by the fact that, given training, the worst subjects improved their estimate of their rank as well as getting better at the tasks. The paper, titled \\"Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments\\", won an Ig Nobel Prize in 2000. In 2003 Dunning and Joyce Ehrlinger, also of Cornell University, published a study that detailed a shift in people's views of themselves influenced by external cues. Cornell undergraduates were given tests of their knowledge of geography, some intended to positively affect their self-views, others intended to affect them negatively. They were then asked to rate their performance, and those given the positive tests reported significantly better performance than those given the negative. Daniel Ames and Lara Kammrath extended this work to sensitivity to others, and the subjects' perception of how sensitive they were. Research by Burson, Larrick, and Klayman suggests that the effect is not so obvious and may be due to noise and bias levels. Dunning, Kruger, and coauthors' latest paper on this subject comes to qualitatively similar conclusions after making some attempt to test alternative explanations.  Driving ability  Svenson (1981) surveyed 161 students in Sweden and the United States, asking them to compare their driving skills and safety to other people's. For driving skills, 93% of the U.S. sample and 69% of the Swedish sample put themselves in the top 50%; for safety, 88% of the U.S. and 77% of the Swedish put themselves in the top 50%. McCormick, Walkey and Green (1986) found similar results in their study, asking 178 participants to evaluate their position on eight different dimensions of driving skills (examples include the \\"dangerous‚Äìsafe\\" dimension and the \\"considerate‚Äìinconsiderate\\" dimension). Only a small minority rated themselves as below the median, and when all eight dimensions were considered together it was found that almost 80% of participants had evaluated themselves as being an above-average driver. One commercial survey showed that 36% of drivers believed they were an above-average driver while texting or sending emails compared to other drivers; 44% considered themselves average, and 18% below average.  Health  Illusory superiority was found in a self-report study of health behaviors (Hoorens & Harris, 1998) that asked participants to estimate how often they and their peers carried out healthy and unhealthy behaviors. Participants reported that they carried out healthy behaviors more often than the average peer, and unhealthy behaviors less often. The findings held even for expected future behavior.  Immunity to bias  Subjects describe themselves in positive terms compared to other people, and this includes describing themselves as less susceptible to bias than other people. This effect is called the \\"bias blind spot\\" and has been demonstrated independently.  IQ  One of the main effects of illusory superiority in IQ is the \\"Downing effect\\". This describes the tendency of people with a below-average IQ to overestimate their IQ, and of people with an above-average IQ to underestimate their IQ. This tendency was first observed by C. L. Downing, who conducted the first cross-cultural studies on perceived intelligence. His studies also showed that the ability to accurately estimate other people's IQs was proportional to one's own IQ (i.e., the lower the IQ, the less capable of accurately appraising other people's IQs). People with high IQs are better overall at appraising other people's IQs, but when asked about the IQs of people with similar IQs as themselves, they are likely to rate them as having higher IQs. The disparity between actual IQ and perceived IQ has also been noted between genders by British psychologist Adrian Furnham, in whose work there was a suggestion that, on average, men are more likely to overestimate their intelligence by 5 points, while women are more likely to underestimate their IQ by a similar margin.  Memory  Illusory superiority has been found in studies comparing memory self-reports, such as Schmidt, Berg & Deelman's research in older adults. This study involved participants aged between 46 and 89 years of age comparing their own memory to that of peers of the same age group, 25-year-olds and their own memory at age 25. This research showed that participants exhibited illusory superiority when comparing themselves to both peers and younger adults, however the researchers asserted that these judgments were only slightly related to age.  Popularity  In Zuckerman and Jost's study, participants were given detailed questionnaires about their friendships and asked to assess their own popularity. Using social network analysis, they were able to show that participants generally had exaggerated perceptions of their own popularity, especially in comparison to their own friends. Despite the fact that most people in the study believed that they had more friends than their friends, a 1991 study by sociologist Scott L. Feld on the friendship paradox shows that on average, due to sampling bias, most people have fewer friends than their friends have..  Relationship happiness  Researchers have also found illusory superiority in relationship satisfaction. For example, one study found that participants perceived their own relationships as better than others' relationships on average, but thought that the majority of people were happy with their relationships. It also found evidence that the higher the participants rated their own relationship happiness, the more superior they believed their relationship was‚Äîillusory superiority also increased their own relationship satisfaction. This effect was pronounced in men, whose satisfaction was especially related to the perception that one's own relationship was superior as well as to the assumption that few others were unhappy in their relationships. On the other hand, women's satisfaction was particularly related to the assumption that most people were happy with their relationship. One study found that participants became defensive when their spouse or partner were perceived by others to be more successful in any aspect of their life, and had the tendency to exaggerate their success and understate their spouse or partner's success.  Self, friends, and peers  One of the first studies that found illusory superiority was carried out in the United States by the College Board in 1976. A survey was attached to the SAT exams (taken by one million students annually), asking the students to rate themselves relative to the median of the sample (rather than the average peer) on a number of vague positive characteristics. In ratings of leadership, 70% of the students put themselves above the median. In ability to get on well with others, 85% put themselves above the median; 25% rated themselves in the top 1%. A 2002 study on illusory superiority in social settings, with participants comparing themselves to friends and other peers on positive characteristics (such as punctuality and sensitivity) and negative characteristics (such as naivety or inconsistency). This study found that participants rated themselves more favorably than their friends, but rated their friends more favorably than other peers (but there were several moderating factors). Research by Perloff and Fetzer, Brown, and Henri Tajfel and John C. Turner also found friends being rated higher than other peers. Tajfel and Turner attributed this to an \\"ingroup bias\\" and suggested that this was motivated by the individual's desire for a \\"positive social identity\\".  Moderating factors  While illusory superiority has been found to be somewhat self-serving, this does not mean that it will predictably occur‚Äîit is not constant. The strength of the effect is moderated by many factors, the main examples of which have been summarized by Alicke and Govorun (2005).  Interpretability/ambiguity of trait  This is a phenomenon that Alicke and Govorun have described as \\"the nature of the judgement dimension\\" and refers to how subjective (abstract) or objective (concrete) the ability or characteristic being evaluated is. Research by Sedikides & Strube (1997) has found that people are more self-serving (the effect of illusory superiority is stronger) when the event in question is more open to interpretation, for example social constructs such as popularity and attractiveness are more interpretable than characteristics such as intelligence and physical ability. This has been partly attributed also to the need for a believable self-view. The idea that ambiguity moderates illusory superiority has empirical research support from a study involving two conditions: in one, participants were given criteria for assessing a trait as ambiguous or unambiguous, and in the other participants were free to assess the traits according to their own criteria. It was found that the effect of illusory superiority was greater in the condition where participants were free to assess the traits. The effects of illusory superiority have also been found to be strongest when people rate themselves on abilities at which they are totally incompetent. These subjects have the greatest disparity between their actual performance (at the low end of the distribution) and their self-rating (placing themselves above average). This Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect is interpreted as a lack of metacognitive ability to recognize their own incompetence.  Method of comparison  The method used in research into illusory superiority has been found to have an implication on the strength of the effect found. Most studies into illusory superiority involve a comparison between an individual and an average peer, of which there are two methods: direct comparison and indirect comparison. A direct comparison‚Äîwhich is more commonly used‚Äîinvolves the participant rating themselves and the average peer on the same scale, from \\"below average\\" to \\"above average\\" and results in participants being far more self-serving. Researchers have suggested that this occurs due to the closer comparison between the individual and the average peer, however use of this method means that it is impossible to know whether a participant has overestimated themselves, underestimated the average peer, or both. The indirect method of comparison involves participants rating themselves and the average peer on separate scales and the illusory superiority effect is found by taking the average peer score away from the individual's score (with a higher score indicating a greater effect). While the indirect comparison method is used less often it is more informative in terms of whether participants have overestimated themselves or underestimated the average peer, and can therefore provide more information about the nature of illusory superiority.  Comparison target  The nature of the comparison target is one of the most fundamental moderating factors of the effect of illusory superiority, and there are two main issues relating to the comparison target that need to be considered. First, research into illusory superiority is distinct in terms of the comparison target because an individual compares themselves with a hypothetical average peer rather than a tangible person. Alicke et al. (1995) found that the effect of illusory superiority was still present but was significantly reduced when participants compared themselves with real people (also participants in the experiment, who were seated in the same room), as opposed to when participants compared themselves with an average peer. This suggests that research into illusory superiority may itself be biasing results and finding a greater effect than would actually occur in real life. Further research into the differences between comparison targets involved four conditions where participants were at varying proximity to an interview with the comparison target: watching live in the same room; watching on tape; reading a written transcript; or making self-other comparisons with an average peer. It was found that when the participant was further removed from the interview situation (in the tape observation and transcript conditions) the effect of illusory superiority was found to be greater. Researchers asserted that these findings suggest that the effect of illusory superiority is reduced by two main factors‚Äîindividuation of the target and live contact with the target. Second, Alicke et al.'s (1995) studies investigated whether the negative connotations to the word \\"average\\" may have an effect on the extent to which individuals exhibit illusory superiority, namely whether the use of the word \\"average\\" increases illusory superiority. Participants were asked to evaluate themselves, the average peer and a person whom they had sat next to in the previous experiment, on various dimensions. It was found that they placed themselves highest, followed by the real person, followed by the average peer, however the average peer was consistently placed above the mean point on the scale, suggesting that the word \\"average\\" did not have a negative effect on the participant's view of the average peer.  Controllability  An important moderating factor of the effect of illusory superiority is the extent to which an individual believes they are able to control and change their position on the dimension concerned. According to Alicke & Govorun positive characteristics that an individual believes are within their control are more self-serving, and negative characteristics that are seen as uncontrollable are less detrimental to self-enhancement. This theory was supported by Alicke's (1985) research, which found that individuals rated themselves as higher than an average peer on positive controllable traits and lower than an average peer on negative uncontrollable traits. The idea, suggested by these findings, that individuals believe that they are responsible for their success and some other factor is responsible for their failure is known as the self-serving bias.  Individual differences of judge  Personality characteristics vary widely between people and have been found to moderate the effects of illusory superiority, one of the main examples of this is self-esteem. Brown (1986) found that in self-evaluations of positive characteristics participants with higher self-esteem showed greater illusory superiority bias than participants with lower self-esteem. Additionally, another study found that participants pre-classified as having high self- esteem tended to interpret ambiguous traits in a self-serving way, whereas participants pre-classified as having low self-esteem did not do this.  Relation to mental health  Psychology has traditionally assumed that generally accurate self-perceptions are essential to good mental health. This was challenged by a 1988 paper by Taylor and Brown, who argued that mentally healthy individuals typically manifest three cognitive illusions‚Äîillusory superiority, illusion of control, and optimism bias. This idea rapidly became very influential, with some authorities concluding that it would be therapeutic to deliberately induce these biases. Since then, further research has both undermined that conclusion and offered new evidence associating illusory superiority with negative effects on the individual. One line of argument was that in the Taylor and Brown paper, the classification of people as mentally healthy or unhealthy was based on self-reports rather than objective criteria. Hence it was not surprising that people prone to self- enhancement would exaggerate how well-adjusted they are. One study claimed that \\"mentally normal\\" groups were contaminated by \\"defensive deniers\\", who are the most subject to positive illusions. A longitudinal study found that self-enhancement biases were associated with poor social skills and psychological maladjustment. In a separate experiment where videotaped conversations between men and women were rated by independent observers, self- enhancing individuals were more likely to show socially problematic behaviors such as hostility or irritability. A 2007 study found that self-enhancement biases were associated with psychological benefits (such as subjective well- being) but also inter- and intra-personal costs (such as anti-social behavior).  Worse-than-average effect  In contrast to what is commonly believed, research has found that better-than-average effects are not universal. In fact, much recent research has found the opposite effect in many tasks, especially if they were more difficult.  Self-esteem  Illusory superiority's relationship with self-esteem is uncertain. The theory that those with high self-esteem maintain this high level by rating themselves highly is not without merit‚Äîstudies involving non-depressed college students found that they thought they had more control over positive outcomes compared to their peers, even when controlling for performance. Non-depressed students also actively rate peers below themselves as opposed to rating themselves higher. Students were able to recall a great deal more negative personality traits about others than about themselves. In these studies there was no distinction made between people with legitimate and illegitimate high self- esteem, as other studies have found that absence of positive illusions mainly coexist with high self-esteem and that determined individuals bent on growth and learning are less prone to these illusions. Thus it may be that while illusory superiority is associated with undeserved high self-esteem, people with legitimate high self-esteem do not necessarily exhibit it. Historical antecedents The cognitive bias of illusory superiority has been known throughout history and identified by intellectuals. A sampling of their comments includes: *Confucius (551‚Äì479 BC), who said, \\"Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance\\". *The philosopher Socrates (470‚Äì399 BC), who interpreted a prophecy from the Delphic oracle, said that he was wise despite feeling that he did not fully understand anything, as the wisdom of being aware that he knew nothing. *Playwright William Shakespeare (1564‚Äì1616), who said, \\"The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool\\" (As You Like It, V. i.) *The poet Alexander Pope (1688‚Äì1744), who wrote in An Essay on Criticism (1709): \\"A little learning is a dangerous thing\\" *Henry Fielding (1707‚Äì1754), who in the novel The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling wrote: \\"For men of true learning, and almost universal knowledge, always compassionate [pity] the ignorance of others; but fellows who excel in some little, low, contemptible art, are always certain to despise those who are unacquainted with that art.\\" *The naturalist Charles Darwin (1809‚Äì1882), who said, \\"Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge\\" *Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844‚Äì1900), who wrote in Human, All Too Human (aphorism 483), \\"The Enemies of Truth. ‚Äî Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies.\\" *W. B. Yeats (1865‚Äì1939), who in the poem The Second Coming said: \\"The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity.\\" *The philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell (1872‚Äì1970), who said, \\"One of the painful things about our time is that those who feel certainty are stupid, and those with any imagination and understanding are filled with doubt and indecision.\\" *A quip attributed to Mark Twain (1835‚Äì1910), though possibly apocryphal: \\"When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.\\"  See also  * Anosognosia * Dunning-Kruger effect * Fundamental attribution error * Grandiose delusions * Impostor syndrome * Introspection illusion * List of cognitive biases * Looking glass self * Narcissism * Pollyanna principle * Self-efficacy * Self-help * Self-monitoring * Self-serving bias * Superiority complex  References   Further reading  * especially chapters 5 and 4  * Category:Cognitive biases Category:Error superiority Category:Self Category:Supremacism ","title":"Illusory superiority"},{"id":"17644931","title":"List of Ministers of Natural Environment of Brazil"},{"id":"17644943","text":"Senecio triangularis, known as arrowleaf ragwort, arrowleaf groundsel and arrowleaf butterweed, is a species of the genus Senecio and family Asteraceae.

The route goes from its southern terminus of US-89/US-91 and heads on a northerly path through the west side of Logan. The route's northern terminus is at US-91. Route description SR-252 begins at US-89/US-91 in southwestern Logan, near the Logan River Golf Course, ICON Health & Fitness corporate headquarters and HyClone's corporate headquarters, and heads north on 1000 West across the Logan River. On the southeast corner of the intersection with 600 South is Woodruff Elementary School; access from 1000 West was closed before the 2008-2009 school year as a condition of the addition of SR-252 to the state highway system. As it continues north, SR-252 crosses 200 North (SR-30) and 400 North (a proposed realignment of SR-30) near the Cache County Jail.Utah Transportation Commission, Meeting Minutes: June 18, 2004 Finally it reaches 2500 North (Airport Road) on the south boundary of the Logan-Cache Airport, where SR-252 turns east to its northern terminus at Main Street (US-91) in North Logan.Google Maps street maps and USGS topographic maps, accessed May 2008 via ACME Mapper The entire route is part of the National Highway System. History When the Cache Valley was settled and developed in the 19th century, the north-south road through the eastern part of the valley connected all the towns, including Hyrum, Providence, Logan, Hyde Park, and Smithfield.G.M. Wheeler, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Land Classification Map of North-Eastern Utah and South-Eastern Idaho, 1878 Later, when Logan's Main Street was extended north and south, it bypassed Providence, Hyde Park, and the newer communities of Millville, River Heights, and North Logan to the west. This more direct route became the main state highway through the area in the 20th century, carrying SR-1 (US-91) north of and SR-101 (now SR-165) south of Logan. The state legislature designated two routes in 1969 that served the areas east of Logan's Main Street, following in part the old road from the 19th century. State Route 238 began at SR-165 in Nibley, and headed east on 200 South into Millville, then north on that city's Main Street, becoming Providence's 200 West. It jogged east on 100 South (changed to 100 North in 1970 to remove traffic from the city center) to 100 West, and then continued north into River Heights on its 600 East (numbered to match Logan's grid). Finally, it turned west on River Heights Boulevard (changed to 600 South in 1970 to avoid hills), north on 400 East into Logan, and west on 300 South to end at US-91.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated November 2007, accessed May 2008 State Route 237 continued north from Logan, beginning at US-89 (400 North) and 600 East, and following 600 East, 1000 North, and 800 East through North Logan.

The part of SR-237 on Logan's 600 East and 1000 North, having \\"more the characteristics of a city street\\", was given to the city, and in exchange a same-length segment of 1400 North, a four-lane arterial connecting US-91 to SR-237, became a new State Route 239.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated November 2007, accessed May 2008 This left SR-237's south end at 800 East and 1000 North, where SR-288, a peripheral route around Utah State University, went both east and south. Portions of SR-288 were given to the city and university in 1992, and SR-237 was extended south three blocks on 800 East (former SR-288) to 700 North, a city street. In order to \\"benefit the long term mobility of the whole region\\", the Cache Metropolitan Planning Organization and Utah Department of Transportation decided in 2007 that a new western bypass of US-91 through the area would help reduce traffic through downtown Logan. In exchange for its creation as State Route 252, the county and cities agreed to take over maintenance of State Routes 237, 238, 239, and 288, minor roads that did not meet \\"the eligibility criteria for what constitutes a State Highway\\".Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated November 2007, accessed May 2008 A western bypass of Logan on 1000 West was planned at least since the 1970s as a local road, but was not completed until about 1990. On the other hand, 2500 North (Airport Road), which SR-252 uses to get back to US-91, has a longer history.

History  According to the legend, the Nezu shrine was founded in Sendagi, just north of the current location, in the 1st century by Yamato Takeru (also known as Prince ≈åsu), the son of Emperor Keik≈ç. The chief deity of the shrine was Susanoo-no-Mikoto, the kami of the sea and storms. In 1705 the shrine was relocated to Nezu by Tokugawa Tsunayoshi (1646‚Äì1709), the fifth sh≈çgun of the Tokugawa dynasty, on the occasion of him choosing his successor, Tokugawa Ienobu (1662‚Äì1712). In turn, Ienobu chose it as the guardian deity. Nothing is left from the structures prior to the relocation, but it still is one of the oldest shrines in the city.

Plot The movie opens on a man, Ryan James, fleeing for his life in a parking ramp. With the assistance of a janitor, Joe, Ryan is able to escape. He makes his way to a police station and speaks with Detective Porhowski, to whom he explains the events that unfolded that night. Ryan claims that he and four other men were abducted, locked in a basement and told they must play a series of games, the winner of which would be allowed to live. Before any games begin, one man attempts escape and is killed before the others. The four remaining men comply and start their first game, musical chairs. When one of the men loses, a film projector shows a clip of the man molesting his nephew. The three remaining men move on to the next game, bingo. Ryan calls out the numbers and when both the men at the table win, Ryan's video plays. He is shown to be a drug dealer whose product has resulted in many overdoses. At this time Ryan manages to escape to the parking ramp where he is chased by a demon. At this point Detective Porhowski, naturally, does not believe the story she is being told. Ryan asks the detective for a glass of water. When she returns she finds that the man has left, though he kidnaps her shortly afterward. At this time the final game is going on between the last two men, poker. As the game comes to an end, one of the men reveals he is The Devil and the other flees.

The name comes from the municipality of Sponheim, where the counts had their original residence.  Geography  The territory was located roughly between the rivers Rhine, Moselle, and Nahe, in the present state of Rhineland-Palatinate, around the Hunsr√ºck region. It bordered the Electorate of Trier to the north and west, the Raugraviate, the Electorate of Mainz and the Electorate of the Palatinate to the east and the County of Veldenz to the south and west, among other states.  History   Beginnings  The family of Sponheim, or Spanheim (German: Spanheimer), has been documented since the 11th century. There are two main branches which are certainly related, but whose exact relationship is still debated. The branch of the Dukes of Carinthia descends from Siegfried I, Count of Sponheim. The Rhenish branch, which retained the County of Sponheim, descends from Stephan I, Count of Sponheim. The county originated from various inheritances which were united in the family's hands, including possessions from the Counties of Nellenburg and Stromberg and jurisdiction of the Gaugrafen of Trechirgau (Berthold-Bezelin dynasty). The Sponheim comital office is supposedly derived from the comital office of Trechirgau.Jackman, Donald C.: Sponheim. Medieval German Counties. Medieval Prosopography. https://web.archive.org/web/20040205173219/http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/d/c/dcj121/prosop/counts/countyA/county11.htm . P. 4 The family of the Counts of Sponheim founded the monastery of Sponheim in the 12th century, where in the 11th century a church had already been built. An abbot from Sponheim, Johannes Trithemius, chronicled the counts of Sponheim and accumulated a large collection of documents on the history of the area.  First divisions, Upper and Lower Counties, 13th to 15th centuries  Coat of arms of Lower Sponheim Around 1225 the county was divided in two, with each portion ruled by a different branch of the House of Sponheim. The Sponheim-Starkenburg line ruled over the Upper, Hither, or Farther County of Sponheim (Hintere Grafschaft Sponheim), based on Starkenburg, and the Sponheim-Kreuznach line over the Lower, Anterior, or Fore County of Sponheim (Vordere Grafschaft Sponheim), based on Kreuznach. This partition took place among the sons of Count Gottfried III of Sponheim, who died abroad while participating in the Fifth Crusade. Gottfried had married Adelheid of Sayn, sister of the last Count of Sayn, Henry III. His estate was divided between their three sons John I, Henry, and Simon I. Simon, the youngest brother, received the Lower County of Sponheim and took up his residence in the castle of Kauzenburg near Kreuznach. Henry married the heiress of Heinsberg, received a portion of the Sayn inheritance, and founded the Sponheim line of the lords of Heinsberg. John became heir to Sayn and to the Upper County of Sponheim, residing first in Starkenburg Castle, and from 1350 at Grevenburg castle at Trarbach. John I's sons divided their father's estate in 1265. Gottfried received the County of Sayn, whose direct heirs are today the counts of Sayn- Wittgenstein. Henry I, Count of Sponheim-Starkenburg became heir to the Upper County of Sponheim. Both territories were extensively fortified throughout the centuries, as evidenced by the existence of around 21 castles or castle ruins, many of which can still be visited today.The County of Sponheim included throughout its history the following fortifications: Allenbach, Alt-Wolfstein, Argenschwang, Birkenfeld, B√∂ckelheim, Dill, Tannenfels, Ebernburg, Frauenburg, Gem√ºnden/Hunsr√ºck, Grafendahn, Grevenburg, Gutenberg, Herrstein, Kastellaun, Koppenstein, Kreuznach, Naumburg, Sponheim, Starkenburg, Winterburg, Zollburg Feuds with the neighbouring Electorates of Mainz and Trier were common, giving birth to southwestern German legends such as the tale of Michel Mort. The Upper and Lower Counties were also not always on good terms with each other regarding political affiliation. During the dispute between the German kings Frederick the Fair and Louis the Bavarian, the Upper County supported Louis, while Lower Sponheim advocated for Frederick. Louis's victory resulted in political strengthening of Upper Sponheim. Around that time, the Lower County had itself been administratively divided between the brothers John II of Sponheim-Kreuznach and Simon II of Sponheim-Kreuznach, with Soonwald forest defining the boundary. Count Walram of Sponheim-Kreuznach reunited the Lower County. Walram became known as an active military leader involved in many actions, including inter-Sponheim ones.  Second divisions and joint regency  Christopher I, Margrave of Baden-Baden, joint ruler 1475‚Äì1515 In 1417, the Sponheim-Kreuznach line became extinct and the Sponheim-Starkenburg line ruled alone for about 20 years over most of the whole county. Count Walram's granddaughter married Ruprecht Pipan, heir to the Electorate of the Palatinate, who died of disease after returning from the Battle of Nicopolis at the age of 21. The marriage was childless, but nevertheless a small portion of the Lower County (less than 1/5) was granted as dowry to the Electors Palatine. In 1437 the Sponheim-Starkenburg family became extinct in the male line, and the counties were jointly ruled as a condominium by female-line heirs from then until the early 19th century. These rightful successors, who took the title of Count at Sponheim (Graf zu Sponheim), were the Margraves of Baden, who descended from Mechtild of Sponheim, and the Counts of Veldenz, who descended from Loretta of Sponheim; both Mechtild and Loretta were daughters of Count John III of Sponheim-Starkenburg. The County of Veldenz was soon inherited by a collateral line of the Counts Palatine of the Rhine through the union of the heiress Anna of Veldenz with Count Palatine Stefan of Simmern- Zweibr√ºcken. The rule of the Upper County of Sponheim was thus shared between Baden and Palatinate-Simmern-Zweibr√ºcken or Palatinate-Birkenfeld; the rule of the Lower County of Sponheim roughly between Baden and the Electorate of the Palatinate.  Reformation  The Reformation was instituted in the County of Sponheim in the year 1557, led by Friedrich II, Count Palatine of Simmern. The county became an important outpost of Protestant territory, with exclaves on the Moselle such as Enkirch, Trarbach, or Winningen, bordering as it did the Catholic Electorate of Trier. Warfare with neighbouring Catholic states would take place intermittently through the centuries, notably including the Thirty Years' War.  End of the county  After the Napoleonic Wars, most of the county became a part of Prussia,Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine until 1822, then Rhine Province and the region around Birkenfeld became part of Oldenburg. The ruling dynasties of Baden and Wittelsbach received extensive territories in exchange for the loss of Sponheim (compare also literature on the so-called \\"Sponheim Controversy\\" between Baden and Bavaria).

History The Leelanau Peninsula was occupied sometime soon after the Ice age glaciers‚Äô last retreat. Inhabitants were initially drawn to northern Michigan because of the fisheries and forests. Agriculture soon developed since there was longer growing seasons. Lake Michigan provided a lake effect warmth along the shoreline in this area. Cree and Ojibwa were among the Native Americans who lived in the area for generations. The first European recorded in this region was Carsten Burfiend. He was an immigrant from Hanover, Germany in 1846. He arrived in the United States at Buffalo, New York and first went by steamship to nearby North Manitou Island. He came to the peninsula alone and left his wife and family in New York state. Burfiend built a cabin there and worked as a fisherman until 1852. The U.S. Government around this time opened up the mainland of Michigan Territory to settlement. Burfriend moved and purchased of land on the west side of Pyramid Point. He then sent for his wife and children.Port Oneida History Burfiend continued to work as a fisherman on mainland Michigan with his fishing boat. Also using his boat he would ferry early settlers between South Manitou Island and North Manitou Island from the mainland of Michigan. History records that John E. Fisher was one of his passengers going to the islands. Fisher was one of the first settlers on the mainland of northern Michigan and a founder of Glen Arbor, Michigan. Burfiend and his family lived in a three-story log cabin on the beach. Ultimately Lake Michigan's fierce storms forced them to move their home to the Sleeping Bear Dunes bluffs above the lake. Because of the harsh environment of the early days, Burfiend lost three of his sons to pneumonia and drowning. Frederick and Margaretta Werner of Hanover, Germany, were close friends and possibly related to the Burfiends. They joined the Burfiends in September 1855 and settled in the area. Several other settlers came from Hanover. The 1860 census shows the population of Pyramid Point to be 87 people. They were immigrants from Germany and Prussia. Port Oneida School Thomas Kelderhouse was a key person to Port Oneida. He developed most of the Port Oneida logging industry. Kelderhouse was born in Albany, New York in 1821. His cargo ships traveled throughout Lake Michigan. Kelderhouse is recorded on one of his trips to have landed on South Manitou Island. He reportedly saw the mainland economic opportunities of the Michigan dense forests of white pine. He negotiated with Burfiend and they agreed on building a dock on the shore of Lake Michigan if Burfiend provided the land. In 1862 the dock was completed. Port Oneida is named after the steamship Oneida, one of the first to stop at Burfiend's new dock. The dock allowed the mainland's hardwood forest to be harvested. Kelderhouse bought land and began processing cordwood to sell to passing ships for firewood. He built a sawmill near the John Burfiend farm. Port Oneida grew considerably over the next 30 years to include many commercial enterprises. Among these were a general store, a post office, a blacksmith shop and a boarding house. There were also two large barns built by other farmers. Kelderhouse owned most of the commercial buildings at Port Oneida and about half of the land on Pyramid Point. He built his home at Port Oneida. Kelderhouse also bought a gristmill on the Crystal River from John Fisher in 1866 to process grains. Between 1880 and 1890, the lumber industry, however, had taken most of the timber. The Great Lakes steamships by then were burning coal instead of firewood. Due to competition, such as the D.H. Day farm in Glen Haven, Kelderhouse sold off the dock and mill by 1880. He died in 1884 which led to the demise of the family fortune. All the original buildings at Port Oneida were abandoned by 1908. Only the Kelderhouse residence was still occupied by his family. In 1934 it was then sold to Fred Baker. The boarding house at Port Oneida was torn down in 1944. Other buildings and the apple orchard were removed by 1952. Wood of these buildings had been used to build the Burfiend pig barn and the Barratt barn. Port Oneida area farming was difficult and harsh. The sandy soils did not produce much. Water was limited, which hindered their efforts. Potatoes were their primary cash crop. Their limited supply of grain sustained small herds of dairy cattle. Most employed themselves outside their farms to make ends meet. Port Oneida was a close-knit ordinary farming community from the turn of the 20th century until World War II. Farmers worked together by going from farm to farm to gather and harvest seasonal crops. Farm buildings description Barratt Pig Barn A typical farmhouse of the area was generally of two stories with the bedrooms upstairs.Farm Buildings Description A Michigan Basement with thick stone walls can still be found at some of these farmhouses. They were used for storing canned goods. Later years furnaces and water heaters were put in the basement instead. Typical outhouses that were associated with the farmhouses can be found at the Thoreson and Dechow farms. There are several barns still existing in the district. The typical barn of the area had two stories and was used for cows and calves, especially in the winter months. Corn cribs can be found at the Bufka, Burfiend, Dechow, Eitzen, and Thoreson farms. A granary can still be found at the Thoreson, Dechow, and Bufka farms. A sugar house or sugar shack is at the Oechow farm on M22. A silo can be found at the Olsen farm on M22. A cement stave silo is located at the Dechow farm and a tile silo is at the Eitzen farm. A milk house or spring house can be found at the Dechow farm and at the Thoreson Farm.

Millican's movies have played all around the world, distributed by companies Curb Entertainment, Artist View Entertainment, Sony Pictures, First Look Media and played on television, both cable and free TV like Lifetime Movie Network and Starz/Encore. Actors like Lou Diamond Phillips, Adam Baldwin, Sean Patrick Flanery, Mimi Rogers, Joey Lauren Adams, Yancy Butler and Tom Wright have starred in Millican's movies.  Biography   Early life  Millican was born in Austin, Texas and moved up to the Dallas/Fort Worth area before graduating high school. He began his interest in filmmaking while in junior high, writing skits and stories. While a junior in high school, Millican helped a college friend with a communications project and fell in love with the industry. He began writing scripts almost immediately. Millican attended three different high schools (Dripping Springs, Austin Anderson, and graduated from Kennedale south of Fort Worth, Texas).  College  Millican attended and graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington from 1983-1989 with a bachelor's degree in Communications with a major in Radio/TV and a double minor in English and Drama. While at UTA, he was a member of Chi Alpha and met his wife Jill in the organization. He also took film electives and completed several short films.  Career  After graduating, Millican went to work in broadcasting and video/film production, in both small and large venue. Later Millican would be the General Manager for a production facility, directing and producing. Millican has won over 30 international awards for his writing, directing, editing and producing of films, television, music videos, commercials and corporate films. Daniel Millican made the leap from Commercials and Music Videos to features in 2000. With his first film The Keyman: Finding Redemption , Millican explored the issues of regret and abandonment on the streets and the destructive power of unforgiveness. That movie starred Adam Baldwin and is being released worldwide by Artistview Entertainment out of LA. The movie was inspired by a near miss when Millican was a new parent. When the film was being cast, Millican chose veteran Los Angeles actor Tom Wright to play the role of a homeless man. Wright has gone on to have a role in every one of Millican's films. Millican's sophomore project was the film A Promise Kept starring Sean Patrick Flanery, Joey Lauren Adams, Jeff Speakman and Mimi Rogers (The Gunman for US video). This movie asks the question, \\"Do we take justice into our own hands, even for the most noble causes\\"? Worldwide sales were strong and the movie was released on video in the summer of 2004. Lifetime Movie Network premiered the film on television in January 2005. The film was shot in and around Millican's birth city of Austin (even though he lives in the Dallas Fort Worth area) in the winter of 2002 and 2003. Striking Range is drawn from Millican's experiences working in the corporate environment. In addition to Lou Diamond Phillips, the movie also stars Yancy Butler, Glenn Moreshower and Jeff Speakman. The working title of the movie was Bloodlines as Millican had weaved the central plot around a hereditary blood disease, porphyria. Later, as that plot point was moved back a little, the title was changed to Striking Range. The movie's central message is one of the devastating effects of narcissism. The movie opens with a quote from 19th century theologian Charles Finney \\"the natural state of man is selfishness.\\" This was from Finney's sermon entitled True and False Conversion.TRUE AND FALSE CONVERSION by Charles G. Finney The Imposter is Millican's fourth film and his first to be targeted for the Christian audience (although Christian themes are woven through all his movies). The movie's main character, Johnny C, played by Max, is a Christian rock star for a popular band called Grand_design. The plot mirrors the prodigal son story from the Bible with a few significant twists. The Imposter was released by PureFlix Entertainment in February 2010. \\"Rising Stars\\" is the fifth film by Millican and stars Barry Corbin, Catherine Mary Stewart, Christian recording star Rebecca St. James and Fisher Stevens. The story centers on a group of older teens who are trying to make it big in film and music. Millican has been compared to fellow Austin- native Robert Rodriguez-as far as the technical areas. Like Rodriguez, Millican writes, directs, produces and edits his own features and even occasionally composes and performs the musical score. Millican lives with wife Jill, his two children.

The showboat contained an intimate jewelbox theatre that seated 225. The interior was decorated to keep in time with the Victorian Era style commonly associated with showboats. The Minnesota Centennial Showboat was run through a partnership with the University of Minnesota Theatre Department and the Padelford Boat Company. The showboat was a longtime tradition with the University beginning in 1958. The University Theatre utilized the showboat as a learning opportunity for its students to experience professional theatre. The showboat had its final performance in 2016.  History  In 1956, the Minnesota Centennial Commission began to plan for the 1958 state centennial celebration. Frank Whiting, director of the University of Minnesota's theater program, saw an opportunity to realize his dream of a showboat theater on the Mississippi River. He proposed a Minnesota Centennial Showboat. The commission agreed, and the search began for a suitable boat. Finding a paddleboat wasn't easy, and building one on an existing barge proved too costly. In 1957, Whiting and the Centennial Commission's Tom Swain learned that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers planned to retire the General John Newton, a sternwheeler towboat built in 1899. Minnesota Senator Edward J. Thye helped to arrange its transfer to the university for the symbolic fee of one dollar. The paddleboat arrived in Saint Paul on April 3, 1958. The university had less than three months to prepare it for the season opening on June 26. Students helped to recreate the atmosphere of an 1890s showboat by painting walls, sewing curtains, reupholstering old theater seats, building scenery, and sewing costumes. The first season opened with a production of Augustin Daly's 1867 melodrama Under the Gaslight. Miss Minnesota Diane Albers, assisted by Doc Whiting and Centennial Commission Chairman Peter Popovich, christened the boat by breaking a bottle of champagne across the bow. James S. Lombard of the commission's arts committee cut the ribbon to open the gangplank. Mayor Joseph E. Dillon of Saint Paul rang the ship's original bell to invite the theater's first patrons aboard. In its early years, the showboat traveled up and down the river. It stopped for scheduled performances in Minneapolis, Saint Paul, Stillwater, Hastings, Red Wing, Wabasha, and Winona. The student cast, numbering about fifteen, performed one or two plays each season. Each show featured vaudeville-style olios (lively song-and-dance numbers) between acts. In addition to performing, the actors cleaned the boat, greeted visitors, and took tickets, among other tasks. 1969 marked the last season the boat toured. Following that season, it made an appearance in the Swedish film The Emigrants before settling into a stationary mooring site on the river's east bank, below Coffman Memorial Union. In 1995, the ninety-six-year-old paddleboat moved to Saint Paul for $2 million in needed repairs. However sparks from a welder ignited a fire that destroyed the boat on the evening of January 27, 2000, just months before its scheduled reopening. Only the paddlewheel and burned-out hull remained. University theater professor C. Lance Brockman led a campaign to obtain a new showboat. In December 2000, the university agreed to a partnership with the City of Saint Paul, the Saint Paul Riverfront Development Corporation, and the Padelford Packet Boat Company to build a new showboat. Construction began the following spring in Greenville, Mississippi. Christened the Frank M. Whiting, the new Minnesota Centennial Showboat arrived at Harriet Island on April 17, 2002. It opened on July 4 with a production of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The Minnesota Centennial Showboat exposed students to a unique type of theater. Student actors embraced the over-the-top style of melodrama. Designers and student crews met the challenges presented by a small performance space. Audiences joined the fun by booing and hissing at the villain and applauding the hero. The showboat program earned the Tourism Partner of the Year Award from the Saint Paul Convention and Visitors Bureau in 2004. The Padelford Packet Boat Company joined the university's Department of Theatre Arts & Dance to create the C. Lance Brockman Showboat Scholarship later that year. The final curtain came down on the Minnesota Centennial Showboat at the end of the 2016 summer season. The university's fifteen-year agreement with the City of Saint Paul expired, and the university cut the program for budget reasons. The final season featured a revival of Under the Gaslight. The university sold the boat to the City of Saint Paul for one dollar. As of 2018, future plans for the showboat are pending a new management agreement. In 2018, a nonprofit raised money to buy the boat and move it to Winona, Minnesota. The Showboat Players The Showboat Players were a troupe of performers that were cast exclusively from students at the University of Minnesota. They performed a wide range of melodramas and comedies, plays most commonly viewed by 19th century audiences. The Showboat Players are most known for their whimsical olios. Many well-known performers today received their first taste of professional theatre as a Showboat Player; Loni Anderson, Linda Kelsey, Peter MacNicol, Peter Michael Goetz, and Jon Cranney to name a few. Olios Olios are musical entertainment pieces performed either between scenes or as an afterpiece to relieve the tension created by the melodrama and its serious storyline. University of Minnesota Professor Robert Darrell Moulton, who created many of the olios performed, found it important to have the olios be in contrast to the play, but be in tune with it stylistically and thematically. The olios mainly depend on the performers' strengths; they may also use a clever \\"gimmick\\" or surprise. It is essential in an olio to present romance, nostalgia, color, extravagance, and affectionate fun. Olios have been a favorite among the Showboat audiences, and this was mainly due in part to Bob Moulton drawing upon his talents as a dancer, costumer, choreographer, and director.

Directed by Tay Garnett, starring Jean-Pierre Aumont and Gene Kelly, was partly based on Hans Habe's 1941 novel A Thousand Shall Fall. The title refers to the French Cross of Lorraine, which was the symbol of the R√©sistance and the Free French Forces chosen by Charles de Gaulle in 1942.Hilmar Hoffmann, John Broadwin, Volker R. Berghahn: The triumph of propaganda: film and national socialism, 1933-1945 (pages 188 and 189) Plot At the start of World War II, Frenchmen from all walks of life enlist. Defeated by the invading Germans in 1940, Marshal Philippe P√©tain signs a peace agreement and the troops surrender. However, instead of being repatriated to their homes, a group of soldiers find themselves in a brutal prison camp. Most of the men resist as best they can, and some, like Paul (Jean-Pierre Aumont), are willing to spend time in solitary confinement and be subjected to beatings, while others, such as Duval (Hume Cronyn), collaborate with their jailers to get an easier life. The men find solace from Father Sebastian (Sir Cedric Hardwicke), a priest who was also in the army and who counsels them wisely. Eventually Paul helps his fellow prisoners to escape. When they liberate a village, they realise that continued fighting is the only option and join the French Resistance. Production The Cross of Lorraine is one of the many Hollywood World War II propaganda films showing life in occupied Europe, with the purpose of explaining to an American audience why US involvement in the European war was just as important as the war against the Japanese in the Pacific. The film is partly based on the German refugee author Hans Habe's autobiographical Ob Tausend fallen (A Thousand Shall Fall) from 1941, about his war experiences fighting in the French Foreign Legion against his former homeland in 1940, being captured and then escaping from the German prison camp. A number of German, Austrian, French and Dutch actors, who had fled Europe because of the war, participate in the film, not only Peter Lorre, Jean-Pierre Aumont, Richard Ryen and Frederick Giermann, but also several of those who participate in minor roles and as extras. The Cross of Lorraine was the second Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production about the French Resistance, the first being Reunion in France, released in 1942.

The use of the term theory here is a statement of colloquial English and not reflective of the term theory. While any sort of thesis or opinion may be termed a position, in analytic philosophy it is thought best to reserve the word \\"theory\\" for systematic, comprehensive attempts to solve problems. Overview The elements that comprise a philosophical position consist of statements which are believed to be true by the thinkers who accept them, and which may or may not be empirical. The sciences have a very clear idea of what a theory is; however in the arts such as philosophy, the definition is more hazy. Philosophical positions are not necessarily scientific theories, although they may consist of both empirical and non-empirical statements. The collective statements of all philosophical movements, schools of thought, and belief systems consist of philosophical positions. Also included among philosophical positions are many principles, dogmas, doctrines, hypotheses, rules, paradoxes, laws, as well as 'ologies, 'isms, 'sis's, and effects. Some examples of philosophical positions include: * Metatheory; positions about the formation and content of theorems, such as Kurt G√∂del's incompleteness theorem. * Political theory; positions that underlie a political philosophy, such as John Rawls' theory of justice. * Ethical theory and meta-ethics; positions about the nature and purpose of ethical statements,Richard T.

(Macmillan, 1967) such as the ethical theory of Immanuel Kant. * Critical theory; in its narrow sense, a Western European body of Frankfurt School Marxist thought that aims at criticizing and transforming, rather than merely explaining, social structures.See generally, Max Horkheimer, Traditional and Critical Theory (1937) In a broader sense, \\"critical theory\\" relates to a wide variety of political, literary, and philosophical positions that take at least some of their inspiration from the Frankfurt School and its dialectic, and that typically contest the possibility of objectivity or aloofness from political positions and privileges.\\"Critical theory\\" at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Philosophical positions may also take the form of a religion, philosophy of life, ideology, world view, or life stance.

Biography Almost nothing is known about Theodoric's life. He is mentioned as Dedo's father by bishop Thietmar of Merseburg. Dedo is the first known count of Wettin, and Dedo's son, Theodoric II, Margrave of Lower Lusatia, is the first member of the Wettin dynasty, taken as established by his father. Wettin Castle itself had probably been in existence since the 9th century, but it is unknown whether Theodoric had already held the castle. From the rank of count held by Dedo, a rank of count is often assumed for Theodoric in German historiography, but authors vary in naming Theodoric a count of Wettin, or of Hassegau, or of Liesgau. Issue Theodoric had two sons: *Dedo I, Count of Wettin (c. 950 -1009), *Frederick I, Count of Wettin and Eilenburg (died 1017), with no known issue. Ancestral theories Thietmar names Theodoric as a member of the tribe of the Buzici (de tribu, quae Buzici dicitur) and as a relative on his father's side of Rikdag, Margrave of Meissen (r. 979‚Äì985). Several possible fathers have been identified for him, but there is no conclusive evidence for any of them: *Dedi, count in the Hassegau (count in 940, died 957), one of the retainers of Otto I, a descendant of Burchard, Duke of Thuringia. Proposed by Friedrich Kurze (1886), based on the name Buzici (Buzo as short form Burchard, i.e. the Buzici would be the Burchardings). *Burchard III, Duke of Swabia (born 906 or 915, died 973), proposed by Reinhard Wenskus (1976) and later Stefan P√§tzold (1997), also based on the interpretation of Buzici as a derived from the name Burchard. *Burchard II, Duke of Swabia (d. 926): the association with Liesgau is connected to this hypothesis, as a Swabian count named Burchard is attested for Liesgau in 965 (known as Burchard IV. im Hassegau, brother of Dedi I of Hassegau). This Burchard is suggested as the son of Burchard II and an older brother of Theodoric.J√∂rg Rogge, Die Wettiner: Aufstieg einer Dynastie im Mittelalter (2005), p. 15. *Folcmar (Volkmar), count in the Harzgau (died before 961) (suggestion mentioned in Lexikon des Mittelalters.) Depending on who is assumed to be Theodoric's father, it is reasonable to assume a date of birth for Theodoric in the 910s, 920s or 930s. The year of his death has been proposed as 975/6, because it is known that his son Dedo in this year took his own mother hostage in the context of a feud (presumably against his father). Theodoric's wife is named as one Jutta or Judith of Merseburg in early modern historiography.

It was the former Motown star's first single with the CBS-operated label and brought Wells brief renewed success on the Billboard chart.Gigolo at Discogs Overview Return from retirement After leaving Motown Records in 1964, Mary Wells struggled to produce hits outside of the label only achieving once with \\"Use Your Head\\" on 20th Century Fox though she continued to score top 40 hits on the R&B; chart in the late sixties and early seventies. By 1974, however, after the Bobby Womack-produced \\"If You Can't Give Her Love\\" single flopped on Reprise, Wells reluctantly retired to raise her four children that she had with second husband, musician Cecil Womack. The couple divorced in 1977 and after being offered a deal with Epic Records in 1981, she returned to the studio to record her first album in thirteen years, In and Out of Love. Among the singles was \\"Gigolo\\", a funky dance hit with the then- current sound mixing dance beats with funky riffs. The song talks about a man who only loves a girl for one night before moving to the next woman. The narrator contends she knew that her lover \\"wasn't going to stay\\" but assures that the man was \\"such a gentleman\\" and trying to explain her affection saying \\"even Cinderella had her gigolo\\". The song also featured a clever rap verse also performed by Mary. Chart status Released in late 1981, the single generated initial buzz in early 1982 where the song became a smash on the dance floor eventually reaching #2 on the Billboard disco chart and #13 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. It also crossed over to #69 on the R&B; singles chart.[ Allmusic review] Though the song wasn't a bigger hit as it was initially promoted to be, it motivated Wells to return to performing and recording full-time as she would until she was diagnosed with larynx cancer in 1990.

According to Greek sources, it dates back to 559‚Äì529 BC. The most extensive description based on a lost account by Aristobulus, who had accompanied Alexander the Great on his eastern campaign in the late 4th century BC, is to be found in the Anabasis of Arrian (6.29), written in the 2nd century AD.Tomb of Cyrus the Great. Old Persian (Aryan) - (The Circle of Ancient Iranian Studies - CAIS) History When Alexander the Great looted and destroyed Persepolis, he paid a visit to the tomb of Cyrus. Arrian, writing in the second century AD, recorded that Alexander commanded Aristobulus, one of his warriors, to enter the monument. Inside he found a golden bed, a table set with drinking vessels, a gold coffin, some ornaments studded with precious stones and an inscription on the tomb. No trace of any such inscription survives, and there is considerable disagreement to the exact wording of the text. Strabo reports that it read: Another variation, as documented in Persia: The Immortal Kingdom, is: The design of Cyrus' tomb is credited to Mesopotamian or Elamite ziggurats, but the cella is usually attributed to Urartu tombs of an earlier period. In particular, the tomb at Pasargadae has almost exactly the same dimensions as the tomb of Alyattes, father of the Lydian King Croesus; however, some have refused the claim (according to Herodotus, Croesus was spared by Cyrus during the conquest of Lydia, and became a member of Cyrus' court). The main decoration on the tomb is a rosette design over the door within the gable. In general, the art and architecture found at Pasargadae exemplified the Persian synthesis of various traditions, drawing on precedents from Elam, Babylon, Assyria, and ancient Egypt, with the addition of some Anatolian influences. According to the records by the ancient Greek historian, Aristobulus: \\"The tomb - in the lower parts was built of stones cut square and was rectangular in form. Above, there was a stone chamber with a roof and a door leading into it so narrow that it was hard and caused much distress for a single man of low stature to get through. In the chamber lay a golden sarcophagus, in which Cyrus' body had been buried; a couch stood by its side with feet of wrought gold; a Babylonian tapestry served as a cover and purple rugs as a carpet. There was placed on it a sleeved mantle and other garments of Babylonian workmanship . . . Median trousers and robes dyed blue lay there: some dark, some of other varying shades, with necklaces, scimitars, and earrings of stones set in gold, and a table stood there. It was between the table and the couch that the sarcophagus containing Cyrus' body was placed. Within the enclosure and by the ascent to the tomb itself there was a small building put up for the Magians who used to guard Cyrus‚Äô tomb.‚Äù The Mausoleum is said to be the oldest base-isolated structure in the world, meaning it is resilient to seismic hazards. It is one of the key cultural heritage destinations in Iran.  Cyrus the Great Day  A cake in the shape of the Cyrus Cylinder and a cake in the shape of the Tomb of Cyrus at Pasargadae Cyrus the Great Day (Persian: ÿ±Ÿàÿ≤ ⁄©Ÿàÿ±Ÿàÿ¥ ÿ®ÿ≤ÿ±⁄Ø ruz-e kuro≈°-e bozorg), also simply known as Cyrus Day (Persian:ÿ±Ÿàÿ≤ ⁄©Ÿàÿ±Ÿàÿ¥ ruz-e kuro≈°), is an unofficial holiday in Iran that takes place annually in the Tomb of Cyrus on October 29th, 7th of Aban on Iranian calendar, to commemorate Cyrus the Great. That is the anniversary of the entrance of Cyrus into Babylon. Cyrus is founder of the first Persian Empire also known as Achaemenid Empire.

They are based in the working-class city of San Pablo, California where they form the core of Los Cenzontles Cultural Arts Academy, where the members of the group were trained. Los Cenzontles have revived and promoted little known styles of Mexican regional music since 1989. The group has collaborated with numerous artists that include David Hidalgo, Linda Ronstadt, Los Lobos, Ry Cooder, Taj Mahal, Jackson Browne, The Chieftains and Flaco Jimenez, among others. Los Cenzontles has produced 30 tradition-based and cross cultural albums, 4 documentaries, and hundreds of video shorts available on their YouTube channel. History Los Cenzontles was begun in 1989 by Eugene Rodriguez as part of a California Arts Council artist residency. The goal of the Los Cenzontles Project was to create a place for area youth to learn traditional Mexican music and dance. When students' training advanced, the original touring group of Los Cenzontles was formed to showcase Mexican folk music and focus on educational outreach. That same year Eugene met Grupo Mono Blanco, leaders in the fandango movement in Veracruz, Mexico. He established a long-term international collaboration designed to bridge the Jarocho and Chicano communities. Chicano teen members of Los Cenzontles traveled to rural Veracruz in 1991, 93 and 98. Rodriguez established the Fandango Project with support from the US Mexico Fund for Culture to create a residency to promote increased cultural participation in California for Gilberto Gutierrez, of Mono Blanco, and photographer Silvia Gonzalez de Leon. In 1994, three major events provoked Rodriguez to incorporate Los Cenzontles as a non-profit organization: # That year the recording of Papa's Dream, produced by Eugene for Los Lobos, Lalo Guerrero and members of Los Cenzontles was released. The recording was subsequently nominated for a Grammy for Best Musical Album for Children.McMullen, R. \\"People: Local talent tapped for Grammy run\\", Contra Costa Times, January 5, 1996. # Eugene Rodriguez incorporated Los Cenzontles Mexican Arts Center as a non-profit, responding to spiraling social problems among local youth. # That same year, 15-year-old Cecilia Rios, San Pablo resident and close friend of many of the Center's students, was brutally raped and murdered.\\"Hundreds pay respect to slain San Pablo girl 'She touched us in many different ways'\\", San Jose Mercury News, March 19, 1994. In response to the tragic loss, the members of Los Cenzontles composed their first original work, El Corrido de Cecilia Rios. In 1995, the group released its first album, Con Su Permiso, Se√±ores. The group has released 23 albums in 21 years and have collaborated with David Hidalgo, Jackson Browne, Taj Mahal, Ry Cooder, The Chieftains, Linda Ronstadt, Lalo Guerrero, Pete Sears, Gregorio Hern√°ndez R√≠os \\"El Goyo\\", L√°zaro Ros, Mariachi los Camperos de Nati Cano, Carlos Caro, Shira Kammen, The Estrada Brothers, Saul Hernandez, Bobby Black, Bill Evans (banjo), Julian Gonzalez, Atilano Lopez, Grupo Mono Blanco and Santiago Jimenez, Jr. Currently, Los Cenzontles tours venues in the United States, Europe, Caribbean and Mexico. Los Cenzontles has also opened performances for Los Tigres del Norte, Los Lobos and Jaguares. In 1997 Los Cenzontles Mexican Arts Center (LCMAC) sponsored the International Youth in the Tradition Festival featuring workshops and performances in Son Jarocho, Conjunto, Mariachi and Banda. The five-day festival featured youth groups from Mexico and California and artists including Lalo Guerrero, Yolanda del Rio, Graciela Beltran, Grupo Mono Blanco and others. The Festival was sponsored by the US Mexico Fund for Culture. In 2002 LCMAC received the Coming Up Taller Award from the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. With support from the James Irvine Foundation, Los Cenzontles began developing a 3-part documentary series in 2003. The ‚ÄúCultures of M√©xico in California‚Äù project is a cultural preservation/awareness project that explores the changing role of roots music and dance in Mexican immigrant and Mexican-American communities in California. Their first DVD, Pasajero, was released in 2004. In 2013, Eugene Rodriguez was awarded a United States Artists Oliver Fellowship. In 2016, Los Cenzontles completed a successful 11 day tour to Cuba where they performed numerous concerts and cultural exchanges in various cities that included Havana, Sancti Spiritus, Las Tunas and Santa Clara. The resulting documentary Conexiones: A Cuban Mexican Connection has been broadcast on Public Television on numerous affiliates nationwide and screened at many film festivals. In 2017, they collaborated with Jackson Browne on the composition, recording and video of their song The Dreamer about DACA youth. In 2018, Los Cenzontles performed with Preservation Hall Jazz Band at the SFJazz Gala that was followed up by an invitation to the group to do a week long residency at Preservation Hall in New Orleans. In 2019, 22 members of Los Cenzontles, ages eight to adult, accompanied Linda Ronstadt on a trip to Sonora, Mexico to perform at the birthplace of Linda's grandfather. Jackson Browne also traveled on the trip that was filmed by director James Keach for an upcoming documentary. In June 2019, the group performed at the Kennedy Center Millenium stage and Library of Congress in Washington D.C. Today, Los Cenzontles continues to perform, research, teach, present and create new work.

The current Prime Minister is Stephan Weil.  Election results  In the most recent state election in 2013, the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) held on to its position as the leading party in the state, despite losing votes and seats. The CDU's coalition with the Free Democratic Party (FDP) however lost its majority to a coalition of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Party Alliance 90/The Greens (The Greens).

It was released in 1975 on Columbia. Recording Once Upon a Rhyme contains one of Coe‚Äôs biggest hit, ‚ÄúYou Never Even Called Me by My Name,‚Äù and one of his most famous compositions, ‚ÄúWould You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone)‚Äù. The former was written by Steve Goodman and John Prine and first appeared on Goodman‚Äôs 1971 debut. Coe‚Äôs version became his first country Top 10 hit single, peaking at #8 in 1975, and includes a spoken epilogue where Coe relates a correspondence he had with songwriter Steve Goodman, who stated the song he had written was the \\"perfect country and western song.\\" Coe wrote back stating that no song could fit that description without mentioning a laundry list of clich√©s: \\"Mama, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or getting drunk\\". Goodman's equally facetious response was an additional verse that incorporated all five of Coe's requirements, and upon receiving it, Coe acknowledged that the finished product was indeed the \\"perfect country and western song\\" and included the last verse on the record: > I was drunk the day Mama got out of prison > And I went to pick 'er up in the rain > But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck > She got runned over by a damned ol' train ‚ÄúWould You Lay with Me (‚ÄúIn a Field of Stone‚Äù) was originally recorded by American country music artist Tanya Tucker and released in December 1973 as the first single and title track from the album Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone). It topped the U.S. country chart on March 30, 1974 for one week and was Tucker's third number-one song on the chart. On the Billboard Hot 100, the song peaked at number 46. Coe‚Äôs version appeared as the b-side of ‚ÄúYou Never Even Called Me by My Name,‚Äù and it would also be recorded as a duet by Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson in 1983 and by Johnny Cash on his album American Recordings: Solitary Man. The song, which contains poetic lyrics questioning the devotion of a prospective lover, was surprising to many considering it originated from a tattooed ex-con who bragged about doing jail time for murder and ran with a biker gang called The Outlaws. Another ballad, ‚ÄúJody like a Melody,‚Äù was a favourite of Coe‚Äôs, with the songwriter confessing later: In his AllMusic review of the album, Thom Jurek writes, ‚ÄúAfter the emotional impact of the first two tracks, add two self-penned masterpieces ‚Äì ‚ÄòLoneliness in Ruby's Eyes‚Äô and ‚ÄòWould You Be My Lady‚Äô - and the listener is left nearly breathless. But with Coe, that's not enough, and he digs deeper emotionally with ‚ÄòSweet Vibrations‚Äô and ‚ÄòAnother Pretty Country Song.‚Äô\\" Producer Rod Beldsoe utilises many of the same top shelf musicians and session players on this album as he had on Coe's major label debut the year before.  Reception  Allmusic: Once Upon a Rhyme and its predecessor, The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy, established Coe as a major songwriting force; they remain enduring testaments to his songwriting brilliance as a criminally under- examined talent in the country tradition.\\" Track listing All Songs written by David Allan Coe except where noted. #\\"Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone)\\" ‚Äì 2:42 #\\"Jody Like a Melody\\" (Coe, Jimmy Lewis Howard) ‚Äì 3:03 #\\"Loneliness in Ruby's Eyes\\" ‚Äì 3:06 #\\"Would You Be My Lady\\" ‚Äì 2:49 #\\"Sweet Vibrations (Some Folks Call It Love)\\" (Coe, Debbie Cole) ‚Äì 3:05 #\\"Another Pretty Country Song\\" (Coe, Oris R.

Maloney (born May 22, 1889 in San Francisco, California - died January 15, 1986 in Belmont, California) was first elected to the California State Senate in 1924. He was reelected in 1927. In 1932 the Federal government instituted the Federal Reapportionment plan. When this happened Senator Maloney decided to run for State Assembly instead of the State Senate. He was elected to represent the 23rd assembly district. He rose to become speaker pro tem in 1943 and kept the job through four speakers. He held this position until 1956 when he lost the race for reelection. During his time in the Senate and the Assembly Senator Maloney was elected as Speaker Pro Tempore of the Assembly and appointed to committees handling Constitutional Amendments, Finance and Insurance issues, and Government Organization issues. He gained a reputation for supporting labor, industry and business.  Family  Senator Maloney was the eldest of eighteen children. He was born in 1889 to John Maloney and Julia (Smith) Maloney. The first nine children including Tom were born by Julia, who died when was Tom was still very young. After her death John Maloney quickly remarried and nine more children were added to the family by Tom's stepmother. With so many mouths to feed, money didn't go very far. To make matters worse only a few weeks after Julia's death John was injured while working as a stevedore on the dock. This left him unable to work as much as he used to. Tom as the oldest went to work at the age of six selling news papers down on the dock. Tom would buy the papers for a nickel and sell them to the dock men for a dime. He would sell these papers all along the dock both before and after school each day. At age eleven Tom began work on the dock scaling boilers on steamships. As a twelve-year-old, Tommy worked helping to run his father's saloon, the Cuckoo's Nest at First and Brannan in San Francisco.Dowling, P.J., (1998). \\"The Maloney Brothers: The Senator and the Sage\\" in Irish Californians: Historic, Benevolent, Romantic. San Francisco: Scotwall Associates. (pp. 133) The Cuckoo's Nest was reputed to be a popular establishment for police and firefighters. Later he worked as a stevedore and after that in a lumber yard. In 1911 Tom married Ellen Twomey, and they had four children: Tom, Jack, Alice, and Barbara.Dowling, P.J., (1998). \\"The Maloney Brothers: The Senator and the Sage\\" in Irish Californians: Historic, Benevolent, Romantic.

Senator Maloney was elected in 1924 to the Senate, served two terms, then his senate district was abolished and he became an assemblyman; he was known in the Senate to be a very fine man.  Assembly career  Known as the Unbeatable Tommy Maloney at the end of his career, he had been Speaker Pro Tem of the California Assembly and a thirty-two year veteran of Sacramento. He was also known as an icon of the San Francisco Irish Community. Maloney was not known to be like those Assemblymen from San Francisco who did little work. The state's most important laws on worker compensation, payments for the sick and disabled, benefits for the aged, the blind, and housing for veterans were among bills he wrote or championed.

Although the term is a counterpart of jjim ‚Äî a category of dishes that are made by steaming meat or seafood ‚Äî the concept is not clearly settled. Other dishes similar to seon include gajiseon (Í∞ÄÏßÄÏÑ†, steamed eggplant), gochuseon (Í≥†Ï∂îÏÑ†, steamed chili pepper), donggwaseon (ÎèôÍ≥ºÏÑ†, steamed winter melon), museon (Î¨¥ÏÑ†, steamed radish), baechuseon (steamed Napa cabbage) and dubuseon (steamed tofu). Preparation To make a hobakseon (Ìò∏Î∞ïÏÑ†) or oiseon (Ïò§Ïù¥ÏÑ†), a cucumber (or zucchini) is cut into pieces about 4 to 5 cm. in length and then quartered. The pieces are lightly salted and then slightly squeezed to drain water from them. Beef or chicken, along with onion, is chopped and mixed with seasonings to make the stuffing. Then, prepared pieces of the cucumber are stuffed with the meat and placed in a pot. After that, pour the vegetable broth on the ingredients until they are partially covered with liquid. Soaked and stuffed cucumber boiled or steamed with the sauce for about 5-10 minutes. The dish is served with slices of seogi (ÏÑùÏù¥, Umbilicaria esculenta), chili threads and egg garnish place on top of the cucumber, similarly to gomyeong (Í≥†Î™Ö, garnishes). In historical cookbooks According to Eumsik dimibang, a Korean cookbook written during mid-Joseon Dynasty, the historical recipe of the donggwaseon (ÎèôÍ≥ºÏÑ†, a variety of seon made with dongga (winter melon)) is very different from today's version. Thick slices of winter melon are lightly parboiled in the water and put into a bowl with the boiled mixture of ganjang, water and oil. In a new bowl boiled ganjang is mixed with minced ginger and then, poured over the vegetables. Donggwaseon is served with vinegar which is spread over the dish. In Siui jeonseo, a cookbook written in the late 19th century, a recipe of hobakseon (Ìò∏Î∞ïÏÑ†, a zucchini seon) is similar to the modern one. A zucchini is hollowed out, filled with various condiments and then steamed. A sauce made with vinegar, ganjang and honey is poured over the ready dish. The dish is served with sliced chili pepper, seogi (ÏÑùÏù¥ Umbilicaria esculenta) and jidan (fried eggs) that are placed on the zucchini and sprinkled with pine nuts. However, the term did not reach its modern meaning until the late 1930s. Cookbooks that were written before that time use the term very differently. They refer to cheongeoseon (Ï≤≠Ïñ¥ÏÑ†, steamed and stuffed herring), yangseon (ÏñëÏÑ†, steamed and stuffed beef intestine), or dalgyalseon (Îã¨Í±ÄÏÑ†, steamed eggs). Today, the term \\"seon\\" refers to dish made from stuffed vegetables.

The excesses of the French Revolution gave him a hatred of the French Republic and later Empire, and his exemplary service in the West Indies, the Netherlands, Malta, Italy, Egypt, the Adriatic and finally the Peninsular War demonstrated both his keen tactical and strategic understanding his and personal courage.

In approximately 1785 he was sent to school in France, the prestigious military academy at Brienne-le-Ch√¢teau, where he formed a lasting friendship with Louis-Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne, future secretary to Napoleon. Oswald spent many school holidays with his friends in Paris and developed an affection for France and the French language that he retained throughout his life.Oswald, Sir John, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, H. M. Chichester.

Regimental captaincy The French Revolution and the consequent Reign of Terror resulted in the deaths of many of Oswald's school friends, creating in Oswald a lifelong hatred of the French Republic and the principles it was based on. At the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, the 35th was ordered to the West Indies, Oswald resigning his appointment as a staff officer (brigade major) to accompany them. A few months later, Oswald was serving in the Caribbean with a detachment of local troops with the temporary rank of major.

Different cheeses require different knives, according primarily to hardness; most often \\"cheese knife\\" refers to a knife designed for soft cheese. Soft cheese knives An assortment of different cheese slicers Soft cheese knives are designed to deal with the stickiness of soft cheese. When the cheese does not stick to the blade, it allows for pieces of cheese to be presented more attractively, with crisper shapes compared to cheese cut with standard knives. The blades of cheese knives are usually made of a material such as stainless steel, which is resistant to the stickiness of cheese. Another design feature often found is the presence of holes in the blade to help to prevent the cheese from sticking to it. Some soft cheese knives also include a ridge, which runs vertically near the top of the blade. This helps separate the cheese as it is being sliced. Some cheese knives have a forked end, used for serving slices of cheese. Most ordinary knives have a blade that is wide at the base and tapers to the tip. A cheese knife, on the other hand, may look similar to a cleaver in that it starts out thinner at the handle and then gets wider away from the base. Some cheese knives have angled handles to make an easier cut. The non-sticky characteristics of a cheese knife also make them useful for cutting other sticky foods, such as cakes, eggs, and pies; compare also egg slicer. Hard cheese knives Parmesan cheese knife, featuring a short, stubby blade Hard cheeses instead require a tough blade, which will not be damaged by the hard cheese. Exemplary is the distinctive Parmesan cheese knife, which is short, thick, and stubby, like an oyster knife. Alternatives Various non-knife devices are used for cutting cheese, such as a wire cheese cutter, which completely avoids adhesion, a cheese slicer, used primarily for thin slices of medium-hard cheeses, used especially in Scandinavia for cutting cheese for sandwiches, and the girolle, used to cut the hard T√™te de Moine cheese by scraping. Cheese slicer Osteh√∏vel A cheese slicer is used usually to cut semi-hard and hard cheeses. It produces thin, even slices. There are different styles of cheese slicers, designed for cheeses of varying hardness. A cheese slicer can be also used for slicing cold butter, zucchini, cucumber or cabbage. Osteh√∏vel, a modern cheese slicer or cheese plane, was invented by Thor Bj√∏rklund in 1925 in Norway. Mass production of the Osteh√∏vel cheese slicer started during 1927 in Lillehammer, Norway. The design was based on the carpenter's plane. This style of slicer is very common in the Nordic countries, and in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.About Us: History (Thor Bj√∏rklund & S√∏nner AS) Cheese cutter Cheese cutter, an alternative to the cheese knife Cheese cutters are designed to cut soft, sticky cheeses (moist and oily), and accordingly do not have a large sharp-edged blade; compare to a cheese knife with holes in the blade. The cutting edge of cheese cutters are typically a fine gauge stainless steel or aluminium wire (a \\"cheesewire\\") stretched across a supporting frame. The thin wire cuts through a cheese block with hand pressure. The original Prodyne Gourmet Cheese Slicer had a wooden board with a slot cut into it and a hole through which one end of a U-shaped steel cutting arm was inserted. In the patented design, a stainless steel wire extends between the two ends of the cutting arm fit into the slot, and cuts the cheese. The wire has loops at each end; one loop is around the steel cutting arm in the slot, while the other passes around a metal pin though a plastic handle on the other end of the cutting arm. The plastic handle rotates upward to tighten the wire, and is secured to the cutting arm with a screw. The board-style cheese slicer has been expanded to include marble, stainless steel, and plastic cutting boards. Several other designs of handles and wire holders have also been invented to hold the cutting wires of cheese slicing boards. Many of these wires have loops on the ends like the Prodyne models; others have small rings or knots that fit into a slot on the handle and cutting arm. Girolle Girolle The girolle is a utensil for scraping T√™te de Moine Swiss cheese into the form of rosettes that resemble chanterelle mushrooms (also known as girolle in French, hence the name of the device). This cheese was traditionally scraped with a knife. The girolle was invented in 1982 by Nicolas Crevoisier of the Swiss Jura and is produced by the M√©tafil-laGirolle company.

In 1883, Meaker was convicted of and hanged for the murder of her husband's niece Alice near Burlington, Vermont. The crime Sometime in the spring of 1879, a child welfare worker approached Meaker and her husband to ask if they would consider taking Mr. Meaker's eight-year-old niece, Alice and her brother, Henry, into their home, as the children were living in an overcrowded orphanage.Hearn, Daniel Allen, Legal Executions in New England: A comprehensive reference, 1623‚Äì1960 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 1999) pp. 273‚Äì274.\\"Mrs. Lucy E. Meaker Still Claims Innocence and Reproaches the Boy Almon\\", Burlington Free Press and Times, March 30, 1883. Mr. Meaker was offered a stipend of to care for Alice, and so he agreed. Emeline Meaker was not pleased with the arrangement and beat, starved, and otherwise mistreated Alice. Meaker decided to kill Alice, and ordered her son Almon to get a lethal dose of strychnine from an apothecary. On April 23, 1880, Meaker and Almon seized Alice, placed a sack over the girl's head, and took her to a remote area outside Burlington. When they arrived at a clearing by a stream, Almon handed the poison to his mother and she poured it into a drink which she gave to Alice. While Alice thrashed about in reaction to the strychnine poisoning, Meaker forcibly held her hand over Alice's mouth to keep the girl from crying out, keeping it there until Alice was dead, and then Almon and his mother buried Alice's body. Investigation and trial Alice's disappearance was investigated, and Almon confessed to the local sheriff. At trial, both he and Emeline were sentenced to death; however, Almon's sentence was commuted by the Vermont Legislature because it was believed that he was dominated by his mother. Almon's confession was published in the newspaper on the date set for Emeline's execution. It was reported that Emeline acted violently while in jail, but calmed as her execution date drew nearer. Execution On March 30, 1883, the morning of her scheduled execution, Meaker ate a large beefsteak, three potatoes, a slice of bread and butter, a piece of meat pie, and a cup of coffee. Then, at her request, she went to view the gallows, remarking that it was not half as bad as she thought it would be. She sent a message to her husband through the sheriff, and then ate a lunch consisting of two boiled eggs, two slices of toast, one potato, one doughnut, and a cup of coffee.\\"A Life for a Life, Hanging of Mrs. Emeline Lucy Meaker at Windsor Prison\\", Burlington Free Press and Times. March 31, 1883. Over 125 spectators gathered in the prison guardroom at the Vermont State Prison in Windsor County, and it was reported that the sheriff was besieged with requests for passes to witness the hanging. When Meaker was finally led to the gallows, and asked (by slip of paper as she was deaf) if she had anything to say, Emeline said in a low voice, ‚ÄúMay God forgive you all for hanging me, an innocent woman. I am as innocent as that man standing here,‚Äù indicating a deputy. None of her family was present at the execution and her husband and children did not accept her body for burial after the execution.

State Highway 63 runs through the valley. The valley opens onto the Wairau Plain, where Renwick and Blenheim are sited. The Alpine‚ÄìWairau Fault runs along the length of the valley. According to the 2013 New Zealand census, Wairau Valley has a population of 1,959, an increase of 69 people since the 2006 census. There were 1,008 males and 954 females. Figures have been rounded and may not add up to totals. Wairauite is an iron-cobalt alloy which is named after the valley. History and culture European settlement J. S. Cotterell surveyed the Wairau Valley in November 1842, and reported it contained rich land. Settlers from Nelson, led by Arthur Wakefield, tried to take possession of the land but the NgƒÅti Toa, led by Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata objected. The dispute escalated into the Wairau Affray at Tuamarina on 23 June 1843, in which 22 settlers and four MƒÅori and were killed. An enquiry held in 1844 by Governor Robert FitzRoy decided that the settlers were in the wrong. In November 1846, Nelson farmers Nathaniel Morse and John Cooper drove sheep into the Wairau valley and established settlements. Governor Sir George Grey purchased the land in the same year, but legal title to the land for the settlers was sorted out later. In the 1855 Wairarapa earthquake, the eastern end of the Wairau valley subsided by over a metre. Marae Parerarua Marae is located in Wairau Valley. It is a marae (meeting ground) of NgƒÅti RƒÅrua and includes the Parerarua wharenui (meeting house).

This species of mollusc was exploited by early humans in North America; for example, the Chumash peoples of Central California harvested these clams in Morro Bay approximately 1,000 years ago, and the distinctive shells form middens near their settlements. Description Like other members of Veneridae, this species has a chalky shell, the umbo being anterior to the midline of the shell, but closer to the midline than to the anterior end of the shell. The two equal-sized valves are oval or heart- shaped. The width of the shell is greater than a quarter of its length, and the shell seldom exceeds in length. The umbones point towards the anterior end of the shell. The hinge has three cardinal teeth in each valve, and a row of small teeth along the ventral margins of the valves. There are numerous concentric ridges, more clearly demarcked at the anterior end, but the radial ridges are often more clearly sculpted. The foot is large and there is a clearcut pallial sinus. Distribution and habitat Leukoma staminea is native to the eastern Pacific Ocean. Its range extends along the coasts of North America from the Aleutian Islands and Alaska in the north to Baja California in the south. It usually occurs in protected areas on sand, hard mud and clayey-gravel substrates from the mid and lower shore down to depths of about , usually buried less than beneath the surface of the sediment. Occasionally it is in more exposed locations, in gravel-filled cracks in rocks or in empty burrows of other clams. Ecology This clam is a filter feeder and consumes microscopic algae such as dinoflagellates, diatoms, and cyanobacteria. Some dinoflagellates produce neurotoxins, such as saxitoxin and its derivates, that bioaccumulate in the clams and other bivalve mollusks and can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) when the clams are eaten. Despite this fact, the clam was eaten by Native Americans and is still used as a food for humans. According to a 1996 report from the Marine Advisory Program at the University of Alaska, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers seafood unsafe if it contains more than 80 Œºg of PSP-causing toxins per 100 g of tissue of the seafood. PSP is caused by a mixture of at least 21 different chemical species, some of which undergo chemical transformations within the dinoflagellates or within the animals that acquire the saxitoxins, and which are retained by different animals for different lengths of time. It is clear that PSP-causing toxin levels are typically much higher in the summer months though this does not mean the seafood is necessarily safe at other times. Risks also vary based on species but seafood available for retail sale is required to meet the FDA standards. In PSP poisonings that occurred in the summer of 1993 in Kodiak, Alaska, saxitoxin levels as high as 19,600 Œºg / 100 g were measured in the Alaska blue mussel Mytilus edulis - sufficient to provide a lethal dose in a single 2.5 g mussel. By contrast, the highest measured level of saxitoxin in the Pacific littleneck clam was 580 Œºg / 100 g according to this 1996 report. Littleneck clams are \\"typically less toxic and retain their toxins for a shorter amount of time than the other species\\" such as \\"butter clams and blue mussels [that] tend to accumulate the highest levels of PSP toxins ... [and] geoducks and scallops [that] tend to be toxic for longer periods of time\\" but this does not mean that these clams \\"are always safe to eat [as] you can get PSP from littleneck clams.\\" The reason for the difference is likely that the littleneck clam has an enzyme that converts saxitoxin into decarbamoylsaxitoxin, a capability not shared by the blue mussel nor by the butter clam Saxidomus gigantea (in which levels of saxitoxin as high as 7,750 Œºg / 100 g have been reported). This transformation to decarbomyl derivative has been reported in some other clam species and significantly reduces the toxicity of saxitoxins present. Predators include such molluscs as the leafy hornmouth snail (Ceratostoma foliatum) and Lewis's moon snail (Neverita lewisii), the crabs Metacarcinus magister and Cancer productus, the giant Pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini) and the sea otter. Fish such as the Pacific staghorn sculpin sometimes nips off the siphons when they are extended to feed. This clam spawns during the summer in the north of its range. It is a slow-growing species and may live for up to sixteen years.

When Yoshihide is instructed to create a folding screen depicting the Buddhist hell, he proceeds to inflict tortures upon his apprentices, so he can see what he is trying to paint. Supernatural forces seem to be present; one time, Yoshihide speaks in a devilish voice. The story climaxes when Yoshihide asks the lord to burn a beautiful lady in a carriage so he can finish the screen. The lord concedes, but, in a macabre twist, Yoshihide must watch as his daughter Y≈´zuki and her monkey are the ones who burn. The story ends with the magnificently horrible screen completed, and Yoshihide‚Äôs suicide by hanging.  Themes  The work follows one of Akutagawa‚Äôs major styles: the updating of ancient tales to reflect modern psychology. One major psychological theme is artistic obsession, as Makoto Ueda puts it: ‚ÄúFor Akutagawa the dilemma was insoluble: if the artist chooses to place his art ahead of his life, in the end he must suffer the destruction of his life‚Äù.Ueda, Makoto. Matsuo Bash≈ç. Twayne's World Authors Series. New York: Twayne, 1970. The story is also an examination of Akutagawa's own devotion to his work. Another theme is the objectivity of truth, as the narrator, a servant of the Lord of Horikawa, repeatedly ignores the physical attraction the Lord has for Y≈´zuki, despite overwhelming evidence. The servant even refuses to believe his own eyes when he witnesses the Lord forcing himself on Y≈´zuki.

His career spans from the 1950s to today, with projects ranging from starting doo-wop groups to music supervising to creating solo albums.  Early career  Vance grew up hanging around the famous Brill Building, the Tin Pan Alley song machine, and started his first vocal group, the Harbor Lites, at 15. The group recorded two singles for Ivy Records in 1959. He then formed another group and auditioned for Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who signed them to United Artists Records, and named the group Jay and the Americans.  Jay and the Americans  Jay and the Americans released fifteen albums, and their first hit was \\"She Cried,\\" which was released in 1962. The group was the opening act for not only The Beatles' first US performance, but also for The Rolling Stones' first US performance. They also appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. They had many other hit singles in the 60s, and started their own publishing and production company, JATA Enterprises. Their last release was in 1971 and the group broke up in 1973.  Steely Dan  In 1967, the songwriting duo of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen came to the Brill Building to sell their songs, and ended up knocking on Vance's door. Vance liked what he heard, and offered to manage them. The duo arranged horn and string sections for Jay and the Americans and toured with them as bassist and keyboardist, eventually recording demos and masters with Vance in 1969. He continued to work with Becker & Fagen until 1971, when he brought one of their songs (\\"I Mean to Shine\\") to Richard Perry, who then brought it to Barbra Streisand and recorded it on Barbra Joan Streisand. They were hired as songwriters at ABC Dunhill Records, and released their first Steely Dan album, Can't Buy a Thrill, in 1972. They went on to become one of the best selling and critically acclaimed bands of the 1970s.  Film and television  After this, Vance began doing session work, producing, and writing music for movies. He was the music supervisor for the movies Eddie and the Cruisers, Animal House (which also featured an uncredited Robert Cray as bass player with fictional group, Otis Day and the Knights) and American Hot Wax with Tim McIntire, Jay Leno, and Fran Drescher. He wrote the theme for the score, produced the soundtrack album (which made the Top 40), and appeared in the movie as \\"Professor La Plano\\" to lead his fictional group, the Planotones, in a performance of \\"Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay\\". The Animal House soundtrack also made the charts and sold over 1 million copies and the Eddie and the Cruisers Soundtrack Album sold triple Platinum. He contributed music for many other films and TV shows, and after being a guest singer on Saturday Night Live in 1977, became the musical director in 1980‚Äì1981. He booked Aretha Franklin and Prince, as well as James Brown, who on his only appearance on the show performed for far longer than his allotted time, forcing the producers to go to a commercial while he was still singing.Songfacts Interview  Current  In 1992, Vance started a doo wop group, the re-formed (no longer fictional) Kenny Vance and The Planotones from American Hot Wax. They released two albums \\"Teenage Jazz\\" and \\"Looking for an Echo\\", and then created the whole soundtrack for the 1999 film Looking for an Echo, for which Vance was also the musical director and the singing voice of Armand Assante. Since then the group has released five more albums, \\"Lover's Island\\", Countdown to Love\\", \\"Dancing and Romancing\\", \\"Oceans of Time\\", and their holiday album, \\"Mr. Santa\\". They continue to perform to audiences nationwide and on PBS. Vance did not perform from 2014 to 2017 for health reasons.

In 41 BC, he travelled on Antony‚Äôs orders to Alexandria to summon the Egyptian queen, Cleopatra VII, to Tarsus in Cilicia. There she was to answer for the money that she allegedly had sent to Gaius Cassius for his war against Antony and Octavian.Plutarch, Antony 25.2-3. In 40 BC or 39 BC, Antony sent him to Judaea to help Herod the Great with the expulsion of the usurper Antigonus.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 14.394; The Wars of the Jews 1.290. In 36 BC or 35 BC, Dellius negotiated with Herod to persuade the Jewish king to appoint the young brother of his wife Mariamne, Aristobulus, high priest.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 15.25 Dellius also participated in Antony‚Äôs campaign against the Parthian Empire in 36 BC. Two years later he was instructed to persuade the Armenian king Artavasdes II to wed his four-year-old daughter to the six-year-old Alexander Helios, the son of Antony and Cleopatra VII.Cassius Dio, Roman history 49, 39, 2-3. It is doubtful if this diplomatic mission was serious because soon after Antony marched to the Armenian capital Artaxata and arrested the Armenian king and his family.Cassius Dio, Roman History 49.39.3 - 49.40.1 Dellius liked to make mocking remarksSome of his bon mots are mentioned by Seneca, suasoriae 1.7; Plutarch, Antony 59. and he was allegedly the matchmaker for Antony to satisfy his erotic passions.Plutarch, Antony 25; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 15.25 Therefore Cleopatra despised him.Plutarch, Antony 59. When Antony fought his last war against Octavian (31 BC), Dellius accompanied his superior to Greece, recruiting reinforcements for Antony in Macedonia and Thrace as the situation deteriorated.Cassius Dio, Roman History 50.13.8 Just before the Battle of Actium, Dellius changed sides, and betrayed Antony‚Äôs plans to Octavian.Cassius Dio, Roman History 50.23.1-3; Marcus Velleius Paterculus 2.84.2 He justified his changeover due to his fear that Cleopatra VII wanted to murder him. He was held in high regard by the first Roman emperor.Seneca the Younger, de clementia 1.10.1 According to the commentator Porphyrio, the poet Horace addressed an ode (2.3) to Dellius. Dellius also wrote a historical work that dealt with Antony‚Äôs war against Parthia, in which he had participated.Strabo, Geographica 11, p. 523; Plutarch, Antony 59 Therefore, it is often assumed that he was the source of Plutarch and Strabo in their account of this campaign. Fictional portrayals Quintus Dellius is portrayed in Colleen McCullough's Antony and Cleopatra as an unprincipled friend of Mark Antony.  Notes   References  * Georg Wissowa: Dellius, Q.

The case involved the murder of Angus Sibbet in 1967. The following trial resulted in life sentences for Dennis Stafford and Michael Luvaglio. Both men were released on licence 12 years later. Notoriety The case gained the nickname in the press as the \\"one-armed bandit murder\\", through the connection to the gambling industry, involving the supply of fruit machines, also known colloquially as one-armed bandits, to social clubs. The case was one of the most notorious killings in the north east, and the first gangland killing sparking fears that organised crime was gaining a foothold in the north east. Luvaglio's Italian surname sparked the headline \\"The Mafia are coming.\\" The trial was one of the biggest seen in the north east. Both men have always insisted on their innocence, with Stafford alleging the murder was committed by a Scottish gangster and Luvaglio alleging it was part of a failed attempt by the Krays to enter the Newcastle club scene. Luvaglio says that he was charged as Stafford's companion because, in his initial questioning, he refused to say that Stafford had left him on the night of the murder. Had Luvaglio made this statement, it was likely only Stafford would have been charged and convicted.See website www.villain-or-victim.com Background Organised crime was on the rise in Britain during the 1960s, with the most notable events being the gangland wars between the Krays and the Richardson Gang. Sibbet was a money collector for a company run by Luvaglio's brother which supplied working men's clubs with fruit machines. The company supplied the entire north east representing a lucrative business for underworld gangs. Sibbet, Luvaglio and Stafford were all friends and business associates. Luvaglio was a Londoner with Italian roots who had moved from London to Newcastle to work in his brother's business. Stafford was a self-confessed \\"playboy,\\" whereas Luvaglio was less involved in crime and was not inclined to violence. Luvaglio asserted that Sibbet was a very good friend of his, even his best friend or like a brother. Murder On the night of 4 January 1967, Luvaglio and Stafford were to meet Sibbet at the Birdcage club in Newcastle at 12.30am, 16 miles away from the eventual scene of discovery of Sibbet's body. Sibbet's body was discovered the following morning at 5.15am by a miner in the back seat of his Jaguar, having been shot three times. The car was under Pesspool Bridge in South Hetton, County Durham. Trial The trial took place at Newcastle Crown Court two months later. As motive for his murder, the prosecution alleged Sibbet had been skimming the takings, estimated as ¬£1,000 a week, supported by the fact he could afford to buy a Jaguar Mark 10. Stafford and Luvaglio were both found guilty, and were sentenced to life in prison. Release and appeals The pair were released from prison in 1979, freed on licence after serving 12 years, after two failed appeals while in prison.The Independent Man convicted of 'Get Carter' killing blames Kray twins The main doubts about the original trial surround the asserted time of death, proving which was key as the pair had alibis for all but a 45-minute window on the night, and the time of death had to be estimated as the body was only discovered at 5 am; the time was at least five hours prior, according to police. Witnesses were reported to have seen Sibbet alive in the car after the time of death,BBC Press Office 31 Jan 2002 or nobody in the car. Doubts were also expressed over the lack of any forensic evidence linking the pair to the scene,www.theclarion.co.uk 'I don't want to die a convicted killer' the actual presence of conflicting forensic evidence,The Northern Echo A matter of conviction, 12 April 2004 and over the relevance of contradictory withheld evidence and witness statements and missing evidence. In 2002, it was asserted by Stafford's legal team that a murder conviction on the evidence would not have been possible in modern times, and the case was taken to the Criminal Cases Review Commission which opened a review of the case in 2005. This later failed, as did an appeal in the House of Lords. Stafford was re-imprisoned for two years in 1989 after breaching his licence by leaving the country, in the meantime setting up in business in South Africa. He was arrested after re- entering the country and being caught in a security check at a hotel where Mikhail Gorbachev was staying. Both Stafford and Luvaglio had been fighting their cases on a separate basis, not speaking to each other since their original release. This was down to the separate backgrounds of the two men, and not due to any falling out. However, a reunion was held after 30 years in March 2008, when they embarked on a Judicial Review at the High Court.Sunderland Echo Sibbett murder convicts to meet after 30 years, 28 March 2008 This failed, leaving the only recourse an appeal to Europe. Stafford parole judgement Stafford was later imprisoned for forging traveller's cheques in 1994.Chequered career of 'human rights' convict BBC News, 28 May 2002 Then Home Secretary Michael Howard kept him jailed overruling a parole board recommendation. This decision was later challenged in a landmark ruling at the European Court of Human Rights and in May 2002 the Court ruled that home secretaries had no power to overrule the parole board's decision and awarded damages.

They appear as thickened, fissured cauliflower-like skin around the nail plate. Periungual warts often cause loss of the cuticle and paronychia. Nail biting increases susceptibility to these warts. Warts of this kind often cause damage to the nail either by lifting the nail from the skin or causing the nail to partially detach. If they extend under the nail, then the patient may suffer pain as a result. Sometimes periungual wart infections resemble the changes that are found in onychomycosis. In worst cases, if the infection causes injury or damage to the nail matrix, deformity in the nail may become permanent.

The blue forward on the left of the diagram is in an offside position as he is in front of both the second-to-last defender (marked by the dotted line) and the ball. Note that this does not necessarily mean he is committing an offside offence. Offside, often pluralized as Offsides in American English, is a rule used by several different team sports regulating aspects of player positioning. It is particularly used in field sports with rules deriving from the various codes of football, such as association football, rugby union and rugby league, and in some other sports e.g. ice hockey, field hockey and bandy. Offside rules are generally designed to ensure that players play together as a team, and do not consistently position one or a few players near the opponent's goal to try to receive a \\"Hail Mary pass\\" for an easy goal without opposing players nearby. However, the application and enforcement of offside rules can be complicated, and can sometimes be confusing for new players as well as for spectators. History The word \\"offside\\" comes from a military term for a man trapped behind enemy lines, where he is said to be \\"off the strength of his side\\". Offside rules date back to codes of football developed at English public schools in the early nineteenth century. These offside rules were often much stricter than in modern games. In some of them, a player was \\"off his side\\" if he were standing in front of the ball. This was similar to the current offside law in rugby, which penalizes any player between the ball and the opponent's goal. By contrast, the original Sheffield Rules had no offside rule, and players known as \\"kick throughs\\" were positioned permanently near the opponents' goal.

Built in an irregular shape, it is located between two of the city's principal streets, the Paseo de la Republica expressway and Arequipa Avenue. History It has an area of eight hectares and is built in a neo-classical style. It was designed by the French architect Claude Sahut and is home to many sculptures built by Peruvian artists. Before construction, the land on which it is located belonged to the nearby Park of the Exposition before the area between 28 de Julio Avenue and Larrabure y Unanue Street was built over. In 1926 construction was commenced as ordered by the president Augusto B. Legu√≠a. It was named of the Reserve in honor of the last soldiers who fought in the Battle of San Juan and Chorrillos, and the Battle of Miraflores. The park was completed in 1929. Magic Water Tour (El Circuito M√°gico del Agua) The Magic Water Tour, inaugurated July 26, 2007, currently comprises the property of the Park of the Reserve. The project was initially criticized because of its costs and design, and that it constituted a complete renovation of a historically significant park. Additionally, others objected the charging of entrance fees to a public place (S/.4.00 for ages 5 and above, as of Jan 2011). Proceeds from this entrance fee were once being used to renovate the Municipal Theatre of Lima, which has since been reopened. By March 1, 2008, the tour received its two millionth visitor. The Magic Water Tour is currently the world record holder for the largest fountain complex in the world, consisting of 13 distinct fountains, many of which are interactive. All of the fountains are lighted at night, many with continuously changing color schemes. The largest fountain in the Park of the Reserve, named \\"Magic Fountain\\" (Fuente M√°gica) contains a jet which forces water to a height of over 80 m. Additional attractions are the Tunnel Fountain of Surprises (Fuente T√∫nel de las Sorpresas), a 35 m walk-thru tunnel of water ; the Children's Fountain (Fuente de los Ninos), a walk-in automated fountain; and a tunnel connecting the two sections of the park which contains an exhibition highlighting recent public works projects in Lima. The Fantasia Fountain (Fuente de la Fantasia), site of a regularly scheduled laser and picture show, is 120 m in length and contains jets that are synchronized to music.

Though he never led a government himself, he helped lay the groundwork which ensured that at the 1905 election, Thomas Price would form the world's first stable Labor government. John Verran led Labor to form the state's first of many majority governments at the 1910 election. Early life McPherson was born in Aberdeen, Scotland and migrated with his wife to Adelaide in 1882, joining the South Australian Typographical Society and working as a printer. McPherson played a big part in the building and management of the South Australian Trades Hall, home of the United Trades and Labor Council (UTLC) of which he became an honorary secretary in 1890. A pioneer in the Australian labour movement, he was an effective conciliator in disputes between employers and butchers, drivers, tanners and carriers, and maritime workers over shorter hours and wage regulation. Parliament 1893 colonial election. A UTLC meeting with the purpose of creating an elections committee was convened on 12 December 1890, and held on 7 January 1891. The elections committee was formed, officially named the United Labor Party of South Australia with McPherson the founding secretary. Later that year, Labor enjoyed immediate success, electing David Charleston, Robert Guthrie and Andrew Kirkpatrick to the South Australian Legislative Council. A week later, Richard Hooper won the 1891 Wallaroo by-election as an Independent Labor member in the South Australian House of Assembly. McPherson won the 1892 East Adelaide by-election on 23 January, becoming the first official Labor member of the House of Assembly at the age of 32. McPherson held the seat of East Adelaide until his death. In his maiden speech he strongly deplored non-European immigration, as was the unanimous view of 19th century Australian man and politician alike, in conjunction with noting the many unemployed people in both city and country. He also advocated a progressive land tax and opening up the land to smallholders. He sat on the shops and factories commission which advocated consolidation and simplification of the Health Act and new laws to cover factories and working conditions. He was also an advocate for eight-hour working days and women's voting rights. McPherson was a frequent contributor in the House on Federation, giving characteristically cautious support - from the point of view of democracy, he was fearful of the power of the Senate. Prior to the April 1893 election, all MPs were classed as independents regardless of their ideological leaning. As such, majority government did not exist, and frequent changes of Premier occurred. It was the first general election Labor would stand at, resulting in conservative and liberal leaning MPs beginning to divide, additionally with unidentified groupings and independents, as well as the formation of the staunchly anti-Labor National Defence League. The voluntary turnout rate increased from 53 to 68 percent, with Labor on 19 percent of the vote, and 10 Labor candidates including McPherson and Hooper were elected to the 54-member House of Assembly which gave Labor the balance of power. The liberal government of Charles Kingston was formed with the support of Labor, ousting the conservative government of John Downer. Kingston at times was accused by McPherson of conservatism. On occasion McPherson threatened to withdraw support from Kingston's cabinet, hoping to get a better deal from the opposition. Labor gained a 5.5 percent swing and another two seats at the April 1896 election. Kingston served as Premier for a then-record of six and a half years, usually implementing legislation with Labor support. Death McPherson, diagnosed with cancer in August 1897, died the following December, aged only 37 years. James Hutchison retained the seat for Labor at the subsequent by-election. His funeral was attended by 1,000 mourners, who followed his coffin to West Terrace Cemetery. An oil portrait by Mrs E. Anson was presented to the Trades Hall and an inscription from Robert Browning was carved on his tombstone: > One who never turned his back but marched breast forward...

Rogers was hanged for the 1902 murder of her husband, Marcus Rogers. Early life Mary Mabel Bennett was born to Charles and Johanna Bennett. Her father was reportedly mentally ill, alcoholic, and unable to hold down a job. As a result, he was abusive and tried to kill her a number of times. Marriage At age 15, Mary Bennett married Marcus Rogers. She was noted for being immature and restless, and often stayed away from home when she was upset with her husband.John Stark Bellamy, \\"Did Mary Rogers Deserve Hanging?\\", Rutland Herald, June 12, 2005. Rogers gave birth to a daughter in 1901. When the child was six months old, Rogers ran into a neighbor‚Äôs home crying that she had dropped the baby, who later died of a fractured skull. Her husband's family believed she had intentionally killed the child. These suspicions were heightened after Marcus Rogers became violently ill after drinking tea that his wife had prepared for him. Mary Rogers moved out of the house shortly after this incident, but her husband hoped they could reconcile. The crime Marcus Rogers found work as a laborer in Hoosick Falls, New York, while Mary lived in Bennington, Vermont. Although Marcus pleaded with his wife to join him in Hoosick Falls, she refused. Mary Rogers struck up relationships with a laborer, Morris Knapp, and two brothers living in the same residence house as Knapp, Leon and Levi Perham. Rogers first approached Levi Perham with an offer of $500 if he would kill her husband. Levi initially agreed to help her, but he was intoxicated at the time and later backed out; he did not tell the police because he felt it was just idle talk. Rogers then proposed the idea of murdering her husband to Leon Perham while they lay in bed in early August 1902; Leon agreed to help her kill her husband, even though Rogers made it clear that her reason for disposing of her husband was to leave her free to marry Knapp. Rogers arranged to meet her husband in a Bennington picnic grove on the evening of August 12. Leon Perham was with Mary when Marcus arrived, but apparently Marcus did not question Leon's presence. That evening, Mary pretended to be happy to have seen her husband and spoke with him of reconciliation. At some point during the picnic, Mary offered to show her husband a rope trick she had learned from a friend.\\"Woman hanged\\", Burlington Free Press, December 9, 1905, p. 2. Mary tied Perham's hands several times, and each time Perham easily broke free of the restraint, with Mary pretending to be disappointed when he did so. Mary then challenged her husband to try the trick. She tied his wrists a few times, and he also easily broke free. Then Mary \\"convinced\\" Perham to try the trick on her husband. When Perham bound Marcus's wrists behind his back, Rogers could not break free. Mary took a vial of chloroform from her purse and forced her husband to breathe it in for about twenty minutes, until he stopped struggling. Mary went through Marcus's pockets and removed his life insurance payment book. Mary and Perham then rolled the body into the nearby river and Marcus Rogers drowned. Mary tacked Marcus's hat to a tree with a false suicide note. Investigation and trial The investigation began after the body was discovered; Perham made a full confession. At Rogers's trial in 1904, Perham was the state's key witness against her. Due to his testimony and his youth, Perham avoided a death sentence and was sentenced to life imprisonment. At her trial, Rogers was portrayed as a shameless harlot and an unwomanly monster. She was found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to death by hanging. Commutation efforts Following Rogers's conviction, there was a concerted effort to have her death sentence commuted. State Representative Frank C. Archibald of Manchester, who was also one of Rogers's attorneys, introduced a bill in the Vermont House of Representatives that would have commuted Rogers's sentence to life imprisonment. The bill was referred to the judiciary committee on October 12, 1904.Journal of the House of Representatives, State of Vermont, Biennial Session, 1904, p. 75. On December 6, the committee reported in favor of its passage.Journal of the House of Representatives, State of Vermont, Biennial Session 1904, p. 389. On December 7, a vote on the bill in the House of Representatives was defeated by a vote of 139 to 91.\\"Bill to Save Woman Beaten: Vermont Legislators Defeat Measure to Prevent the Hanging of Mrs. Rogers\\", New York Times, 1904-12-08.Journal of the House of Representatives, State of Vermont, Biennial Session, 1904, p. 425. On December 9, Representative Archibald proposed a joint resolution of the Vermont House and Senate to investigate Rogers's physical and mental condition at the time of the commission of the crime and at the present time, and to prepare a report as to her condition for the governor.Journal of the House of Representatives, State of Vermont, Biennial Session, 1904, pp. 470‚Äì471. The resolution stated that if it should appear that Rogers either at the time she committed the crime or at present was mentally or physically unsound, that a reprieve should be requested and her execution delayed until after the 1906 Vermont Legislative Session. The House adopted this resolution but the Senate did not. On May 30, 1905, Governor Charles J. Bell granted a reprieve to Rogers after the Vermont Supreme Court denied Rogers's appeal by a 5‚Äì2 vote; the reprieve was intended to allow the appeal to be heard by the United States Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case on November 6 and held on November 27 that the Court could not find that Rogers had sustained any violation of her Federal Constitutional rights by the proceedings of the executive or judicial departments of the State of Vermont.Rogers v. Peck, . Investigation into prison behavior In 1904, the Vermont Commission to Investigate State Institutions began investigating charges of sexual misconduct at the Vermont State Prison, where Rogers was being held. A large portion of the commission's investigation focused on allegations of inappropriate sexual relations between Rogers and two other prisoners.Commission Investigating State Institutions. Investigation of the Vermont State Prison hearing transcripts, 1904-1906. (Vermont State Archives, Record Series PRA-077). Evidence of issues at the prison included the fact that a child was born to Rogers after she had been incarcerated for over a year. Execution After the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Governor Bell signed Rogers's execution warrant and the execution was scheduled for December 8, 1905.\\"Execution of Mary Rogers\\", Bennington Evening Banner, December 8, 1905, pp. 1‚Äì4. Rogers inquired on December 7 whether the gallows were being erected, despite efforts having been made to muffle the construction noise. During the ten days between the signing of the warrant and her execution, Rogers ate and slept well, but she declined breakfast on the morning of her execution. Governor Bell granted leave to hear an appeal from Rogers's counsel at 8 a.m. on her scheduled execution day; however, he found no reason to commute her sentence. With no new evidence, he declined to stay the execution and Rogers was hanged at the Vermont State Prison later that day. She was pronounced dead at 1:17pm. A scandal later ensued because of the circumstances of Rogers' death. The executioner reportedly used a rope that stretched when Rogers was dropped from the gallows, causing her to strangle as her feet scraped the floor. After several minutes, sheriff's deputies pulled on the end of the rope until Rogers was suspended, then held it in place until she finally died. Rogers is buried at St. Mary's Cemetery in Hoosick Falls, New York. Advocates for clemency later attempted to have a large monument to her memory placed at the cemetery. The Augustinian fathers who managed the site refused to allow it, citing a family request that no memorial mark Rogers' grave.

Fox and Nancy McKeon, directed by Larry Elikann, and written by Bennett Tramer. The film premiered on NBC on February 10, 1985 and aired just months before Fox's feature film breakthrough Back to the Future and follow-up Teen Wolf.  Plot  Michael J. Fox plays camp counselor Dennis Baxter, who works at a boys' summer camp called Camp Pinewood, located in Clifton, Maine. He falls in love with the new camp nurse Rhonda and spends the summer trying to convince her to leave her fianc√© for him. Baxter's campers include the slick-talking Jerry Disbro, the sensitive writer Brian (who also has a crush on Rhonda), the baseball star Bobby, the overweight comedian Toby, and the shy Timmy Mezzy who is afraid of the water and wants to run away. Jerry ends up becoming the camp con man, operating such scams as a letter writing concession using Brian, turning the P.X. into \\"his own personal candy store\\", and making outlandish demands to help win Bobby his much-coveted spot on the Varsity baseball team by acting as his agent . \\"It's an honor to play for the Yankees, but Dave Winfield still cashes his checks\\", says Jerry. Along with Bobby, he hatches a plan to sneak over to the neighboring girls' camp to visit a girl he met on the train ride to camp. Timmy is always finding new and creative ways to escape, including busting out in a laundry truck and trying to sneak out by way of the girls' camp across the lake dressed in drag. The camp is run by 'Big Irv' Klopper and his wife Margo (much to her apparent displeasure). Baxter's arch-rival is fellow counselor Ike, who is much more serious about his job than Baxter. Ike is not at all popular among the campers and is seen as being something of a \\"Square\\", having been educated in a military school. Maintenance man Walter carries around a red-stained axe and is rumored to be a murderer. As the summer progresses, Timmy makes friends with the other kids and stops trying to run away. Eventually he learns to swim and enters a swimming race in the annual Color War competition. Jerry, who is on the opposite team in the Color War, tells Timmy the story of \\"Tough Break Thompson\\", a camper who supposedly drowned after conquering his fear of water at the camp. Timmy panics during the swimming event when Jerry says \\"Timmy - tough break!\\" to him right before the race. Bobby then punches Jerry when he finds out what happened. Later, Jerry apologizes and the kids learn that their friendship is more important than the winner of the Color War, and the Color War is declared a tie. The climactic moment of the movie occurs when a camper shouts, \\"Timmy Mezzy's swimming the lake!\\" and the whole camp runs to watch Timmy swim across the lake, finally conquering his fear of water. Walter is also revealed to be a painter who uses his axe to create art. At the end of the summer, Baxter is offered the job of head counselor for the following year, having been chosen over Ike, much to Ike's chagrin. Rhonda and Baxter end up together.

The church building was declared a City of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1975 by the Los Angeles Cultural Historical Board. History The church is in the Carpenter Gothic Victorian style. It was built nine years after the Southern Pacific Railroad first laid tracks through Northridge, which was then known as Zelzah station, in 1908. When it was built, the church was originally known as the Norwegian Lutheran Church, as the six families that formed the congregation were of Norwegian descent. Built of wood in the basilican style, with the steeple at the entrance, the church's early Gothic style is differentiated from the High Victorian Gothic by the thinness of moldings and its generally monochromatic appearance. One writer observed that, \\"with its steep stairs and narrow girth, it looks like a church you'd find sitting all alone on the Kansas plains.\\" Present The original church building still stands at 18531 Gresham Street in Northridge. For many years, it was known as the Faith Bible Church. More recently, the church has been acquired and operated as a Korean congregation known as either the Northridge Free Methodist Church, or the Los Angeles Antioch Church. The sign on the church in March 2008 (in photograph to the right) identified it as the Los Angeles Antioch Church.

Ever since Sir William Thomson's vortex theory, mathematicians have tried to classify and tabulate all possible knots. As of May 2008, all prime knots up to 16 crossings have been tabulated. The major challenge of the process is that many apparently different knots may actually be different geometrical presentations of the same topological entity, and that proving or disproving knot equivalence is much more difficult than it at first seems. Beginnings In the 19th century, Sir William Thomson made a hypothesis that the chemical elements were based upon knotted vortices in the aether. In an attempt to make a periodic table of the elements, P. G. Tait, C. N. Little and others started to attempt to count all possible knots. Because their work predated the invention of the digital computer, all work had to be done by hand. Perko pair In 1974, Kenneth Perko discovered a duplication in the Tait-Little tables, called the Perko pair. Later knot tables took two approaches to resolving this: some just skipped one of the entries without renumbering, and others renumbered the later entries to remove the hole. The resulting ambiguity has continued to the present day, and has been further compounded by mistaken attempts to correct errors caused by this that were themselves incorrect. New methods Jim Hoste, Jeff Weeks, and Morwen Thistlethwaite used computer searches to count all knots with 16 or fewer crossings. This research was performed separately using two different algorithms on different computers, lending support to the correctness of its results. Both counts found 1701936 prime knots (including the unknot) with up to 16 crossings.. Starting with three crossings (the minimum for any nontrivial knot), the number of prime knots for each number of crossings is :1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 21, 49, 165, 552, 2176, 9988, 46972, 253293, 1388705, ...

She has published a number of best-selling travel books and lead the Emergency Relief Team for World Vision Korea. She is one of the top celebrities of impact in South Korea according to Hankyoreh and one of the most respected Koreans in a 2009 poll of university students. In August 2009, she stopped to work in World Vision to study the theories concerning humanitarian work and support at Tufts University's Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy.Why did Han change her mind from travel to relief worker?  Biography   Education  Han Bi-ya attended Seungeui Girls' High School (Ïà≠ÏùòÏó¨ÏûêÍ≥†Îì±ÌïôÍµê) in Seoul. She studied English literature at Hongik University and completed graduate studies at the University of Utah. In 2009, she studied at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University.  Travels  Han Bi-ya first became known for her travel books. She wrote a four-volume best seller, Daughter of the Wind: Three and a Half Times Around the Globe on Foot, an account of her seven-year (1993‚Äì1999) travels around the world. Han had quit a profitable and high-status job at Burson-Marsteller, a global public relations and communications firm, and jumped into what she liked most. Han explored the world, especially many isolated regions, alone and on foot, rarely taking flights. Also, her explorations were not like ordinary trips in that she actually stayed in local people's home as many times as possible and truly experienced the local culture. In some countries like Afghanistan, it is sometimes very difficult and dangerous, especially for a woman, to talk to a local man and stay in his home. In the book, Han states that she put herself in hazardous situations and was fortunate to survive. These adventurous and vivid stories fascinate readers. Her travel inspired her to devote her life to helping refugees as a volunteer worker. During her ventures to the world, Han Bi-ya experienced the awakening moment. She realized that the world is not a Global Village, but a \\"Global House\\". However, Han Bi-ya has said that she would no longer travel, even though travel led her to discover the meaning of her life. She received enough joy from travel and now something else makes her heart beat, helping refugees.  Emergency relief works  Han Bi-ya has been a World Vision Korea Emergency Relief Team Leader since 2001 to stop her work by August 2009 for studying humanitarian supports and relief and has been promoting international awareness of the world's refugee crises. She has been active in Asia, Africa, Middle East, Eastern Europe, Central and South America. Han Bi-ya said that her refugee relief activities have helped her realize the urgent need to develop diverse mechanisms for preventing wars and conflicts around the world. She hopes she can come up with an idea to deal with international affairs in the future through the experiences in relief activities. Her book, March to the World, Off the Map explains several sadness and smiles upon her work around the world. Recently, she appeared on one TV show to explain her joy and life of work. At the show, she became the first person to explain the ceremony of circumcision to viewers of Korea, held widely in Africa as a rite of passage.  Inspiration  Han Bi-ya has said that \\"The happiest person is someone who is on the spot, doing what he or she really wants to do and braveness comes when you don't have fear in trying something, and the degree of braveness varies according to how eagerly you wish to do it. If you find a thing which you think you can die for, nothing can stop you.\\" Han Bi-ya added that she followed her own \\"timetable for life,\\" without comparing it with others. She tries whatever she likes at any age. Han Bi-ya has been a very influential and heroic figure for young people in Korea. Many young women have started to go on backpacking trips, following her routes. Han gives a valuable lesson to the young on helping others in the world, and making a better world together. Listening about her or reading her books, many young Koreans learn to venture and expand their lives to the world, and use their abilities for the world.  Effect   International relief  Based on the 2005 World Vision overseas donation, which has increased since the \\"March to the World, Off the Map\\" published in 2005, it has produced relief team members and cooperated with WFP (World Food Program).  Global Citizenship School  She started the World Vision Global Citizenship School with an advertising fee of 100 million won, and then donated 100 million won of the book \\"That Was Love\\". In addition, she has been providing audio guides at the Global Citizenship Education Center in Seoul Land. In 2011, she became the first Principal of the World Citizenship School.  Educator  After publishing \\"March to the World, Off the Map\\", she began public lecture activities. In 2012, she was appointed as a visiting professor at the Graduate School of International Studies at Ewha Womans University.

His work in these three areas is regarded as among the most extensive of the twentieth century. Early life Henri-Georges Adam was born in Paris on 14 January 1904, to a father from Picardy and mother from Saint-Malo. During his childhood he spent his summers in Saint-Malo and Saint-Servan. In 1918, after attending a watchmaking school, Adam started working the studio of his father, a jeweler and goldsmith in the Marais district of Paris, where he learned to carve and later to engrave.  Training and education  In 1925 Adam took evening classes at a drawing school in Montparnasse and after a stint at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in 1926, became a drawing professor of the Ville de Paris. Beginning in 1928, Adam began to make satirical sketches and political caricatures. \\"His spirit of cynical and apocalyptic derision is of the same nature as that of Rouault illustrating Miserere de Guerre. Anarchist, pacifist, antimilitarist, Adam reverses all taboos. He does not care about the myths of his country, of his family or his religion\\", notes Waldemar George (Adam, 1968, p. 30).  Career  In 1934, Adam got involved with engraving, etching, the use of the burin and the environment of the surrealists, Andr√© Breton, Louis Aragon, Paul √âluard. He made his first exhibit in 1934, with a preface by Jean Cassou in 1936 after which he began his violently impressionistic engravings entitled, D√©sastres de la guerre, in response to the Spanish Civil War. In 1936, Adam joined the Association of Revolutionary Writers and Artists, where he met painters Maurice Est√®ve, Alfred Manessier, , and Arpad Szenes. He took part, along with Picasso, Matisse, Rouault, Dufy, Fernand L√©ger, Chagall, Chaim Soutine, Zadkine, Roger Bissi√®re and √âdouard Pignon in the exhibition Quatorze Juillet by Romain Rolland at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Alhambra, in which Picasso painted the curtain scene. Adam tackled sculpting in 1942, and in October 1943 he, along with Gaston Diehl, , Jean Le Moal, Manessier, Pignon, Gustave Singier, became one of the fifteen founders of the Salon du Mai. That same year, he created the sets and costumes, masks and two four meter-tall statues for Jean-Paul Sartre's Les Mouches which Charles Dullin assembled. Adam also carved Le Gisant, a tribute to the French Resistance and martyrs, which would be exhibited in the Salon de la Lib√©ration. Adam became friends with Picasso, who lent him his studio in the rue des Grands-Augustins where he worked more at ease until 1950. Between 1948 and 1949, at his Boisgeloup estate, near Gisors, he realized among other works, Le Grand Nu conserved by the Mus√©e national d'art moderne. In 1949, Adam presented a comprehensive exhibition of his works, frequently of women's sleek forms, at the gallery Aim√© Maeght and in 1952 his copper engravings based on the year's theme of the Month, went on display in the bookstore-gallery La Hune. From 1950 to 1955, he was a professor of design at Antony, at a college which today bears his name. During 1950, he instructed many painters and sculptors (including ). From 1955, the first retrospective of Adam's work was organized at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. In 1956 and 1957, Adam developed one of his most famous suites of engravings, Dalles, Sable et Eau showing scenes of the sea, sand and granite of Penmarc'h, and a series of sculptures named Mutationes marines. He made new tapestries for the French Embassy in Washington in 1957, Meridien for the Palace of UNESCO in 1958, and Galaxie for Air France in New York City in 1961. After a project for Monument du Prisonnier Politique Inconnu in 1951, Adam's Le Signal was erected in front of the Mus√©e du Havre in 1961, the first of his monumental sculptures. The number of Adam's sculptures multiplied: Le Cygne blanc for the Lyc√©e Charlemagne √† Vicennes (1962), exposition of Ob√©lisque oblique (1962) at the French Pavilion at the Exposition de Montreal, a set of sculptures and tapestries for l'√©glise de Moutier in Switzerland, for which Manessier created the windows (1963‚Äì1967), Mur, a 22-meter-long wall, and La Feuille for the lyc√©e de Chantilly (1965), Trois pointes effil√©es for the college-city of La Fl√®che (1965), a monument for Vichy (1960‚Äì1966), La Grande √©trave for the house of culture of Thonon (1966), Fontaine for the city of Bihorel (1966), Le Minotaure for the college-city of Segr√© (1967), L'Oiseau de granit and La Grande Table de conf√©rence for the lyc√©e technique de Saint- Brieuc (1967). In 1959, Adam was appointed professor of engraving at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts and later head professor of the workshop of monumental sculpture. He installed his own workshop and presses in La Ville du Bois, near Montlh√©ry while many of his exhibitions were presented in museums in France and Europe. In 1961, Adam developed a series of sculptures entitled Cryptogrammes. A retrospective of Adam's work was presented in 1966 at the Mus√©e national d'art moderne in Paris with a foreword by Bernard Dorival. Three of his sculptures and the tapestry Penmarc'h were presented the following year in Montreal.  Role as a War Artist  Mobilized in 1939 and taken prisoner, Adam was assigned as the auxiliary nurse at the hospital Saint-Jacques de Besan√ßon, where he made many drawings of surgeons, soldiers and the wounded. He was eventually released at the end of 1940.  Personal Life  Adam met Russian √©migr√©e photographer H√©l√®ne Adant while they were both students at l‚ÄôEcole des beaux-Arts de Paris, they were married in 1930 until 1945. A collection of papers, manuscripts, and letters by Adant on Adam's work and her work at the time of their marriage are held at the Biblioth√®que Kandinsky, Centre Pompidou, Paris. The collection was donated by Adant's cousin and housekeeper and model for Matisse, Lydia Delectorskaya. In the middle of a creative whirlwind, Adam died from a heart attack on 27 August 1967, at La Clart√© near Perros-Guirec, and lies in the cemetery of Mont-Saint- Michel, the theme of his last tapestry.

The park is operated and maintained by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. It is located on U.S. Highway 97, approximately north of Klamath Falls and south of Bend. The park covers along the Williamson River.  History  The park was established in 1945 when two brothers from Klamath Falls, Alfred and Andrew Collier, donated to the state of Oregon. The land was to be used for a park honoring their parents, Charles Morse Collier and Janet McCornack Collier. In 1947, the Collier brothers donated a collection of antique logging equipment to be displayed as an outdoor logging museum on the park grounds. The equipment shows the evolution of the logging industry from axes and oxen to diesel tractors and logging trucks. The museum also highlights the role railroads played in developing the timber industry. Alfred Collier continued to add to the collection until his death in 1988. As a result, the museum has one of the largest collections of logging equipment in the world.  Collier Logging Museum  Collier Memorial State Park features the Collier Logging Museum, an outdoor museum with a large collection of historic logging equipment. Some items date back to the 1880s and many are quite rare. The collection includes ox drawn \\"high wheels\\" used to raise the forward end of logs off the ground so they could be skidded through the forest to a collection area. Steam-powered \\"donkey engines\\" used steel cables to haul logs to a collection point. There are also steam tractors and diesel \\"cats\\" that performed the same function in their turn. The most modern piece of logging equipment on display is a Beloit tree harvester. The harvester, operated by one person, cuts trees near ground level using hydraulic blades, removes the limbs, and stacks the logs onto a logging truck all in one continuous operation. There are two areas that display large saw mill machinery. One exhibit is a complete band saw used in the Edward Hines lumber mill. This saw turned trees into lumber from 1930 until 1980. A new building houses a saw mill steam plant along with a collect of chain saws. High wheel skidder at Collier museumThe museum also displays railroad equipment used to transport logs out of the forest, including a Baldwin locomotive used in the Mount Shasta area to haul redwood logs to saw mills in northern California. There is a self-powered McGriffert Log Loader built in 1926 which was in active use until 1962. The museum also owns a 1923 Clyde track laying machine, one of only two still in existence. It was used by at various locations around Klamath County by Weyerhaeuser until 1959. The museum even has a diesel- powered tug boat used to tow rafts of logs from an Agency Lake collection site to a saw mill at the south end of Upper Klamath Lake, a trip. The tug was operated on the lake from 1937 until 1943. One of the most impressive exhibits is a cross section from the largest Douglas fir tree ever cut. This forest giant was already an old tree when Columbus landed in the New World. In addition, several logging camp structures have been relocated to the museum site along with twelve authentic pioneer homestead buildings. A logger's cabin is now used as an exhibit building and gift shop. The pioneer village area gives visitor insight into how Oregon families once lived. The buildings also show several nineteen century building techniques used by Oregon pioneers. During the summer, the museum staff shows movies about old-time logging at 9 p.m. every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night. In 2005, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, in cooperation with Oregon State Parks Trust and the Friends of Collier Memorial State Park, financed a major renovation of the museum. The project carefully restored logging machinery, railroad equipment, historic buildings, and other museum artifacts. Interpretive displays, signs, and other materials were also updated. As a result, Collier Memorial State Park has an excellent museum with a world-class collection of logging equipment and artifacts.  Recreation  Park recreational facilities. Collier Memorial State Park is located in an area forested with ponderosa and lodgepole pine. The park's facilities are well developed. Visitors can hike, camp, picnic, or fish in the park. A trailhead provides accesses to a number of hiking trails in the surrounding forest, and a popular horse trail goes from Collier state park to Jackson F. Kimball State Recreation Site. There are 50 sites with recreational vehicle hook-ups and 18 tent sites. There are also four horse corrals. The park has modern restrooms, hot showers, and laundry facilities. The park is open to campers April through October. Campsites are available on a first-come, first-served basis. The park is located at the confluence of the scenic Williamson River and Spring Creek whose origin is a natural spring about a mile from the park. The aquifer that feeds the spring is believed to originate thirty miles northeast of the park in the east side drainage of Crater Lake National Park. The Williamson River is well known for its trout fishing. Brook, rainbow, and native Great Basin redband trout are found in the Williamson River in this area. The brook and rainbow trout often reach , and the redband trout in the Williamson River can reach record size, up to .  Access  The park is located in the just off of U.S. Highway 97, approximately north of Klamath Falls and south of Bend. The area in the Cascade Mountains around the park experiences cold winters with significant snowfall so the park is closed for camping from November through March. Summers are generally dry with warm temperatures, and all facilities are open from April through October.

In 2007, Campbell played for the class-A affiliate of the Blue Jays, the Lansing Lugnuts. In 2007, he showed some promise as a hitter, hitting .279/.390/.397. However, he was not considered a top prospect of the Jays given his age and the level where he played. In 2008, Campbell had a breakout year, increasing his batting average to .341 and his OBP to .435 while moving up two levels to AA. He was chosen to represent the World team at the 2008 All-Star Futures Game. Given his reputation as a solid defensive second baseman, Campbell was once widely considered one of the better prospects in the Toronto Blue Jays minor league system, and had been compared to Chase Utley by Blue Jays General Manager J.P. Ricciardi.

The following year, Scott was promoted to class A in the Midwest League playing with the Lansing Lugnuts, but failed to be listed as an official top prospect during the season despite finishing the season batting at a respectable .279, having an on-base percentage of .390 and making the New York‚ÄìPenn League all-star squad where he walked in two appearances. Campbell continued to rise through the ranks, being promoted two levels to AA for where he played 112 games with the New Hampshire Fisher Cats as their starting second baseman. The year would prove to be a very successful one for Scott as he batted at a .302/.398/.427 clip and was selected in the World team for the 2008 All-Star Futures Game and the 2008 Eastern League all-star team. 2009 gave Campbell a taste of AAA where he played 27 games for the Las Vegas 51s towards the twilight of the season.

China and Myanmar have active bilateral relations with each other. However, recently, the relations between China and Myanmar have faced some problems due to recent ongoing conflicts with ethnic Chinese rebels and Myanmar military near the border, as well as Burmese recent hostilities against Chinese. The relationship between China and Myanmar, while much closer and warmer than relations with China's other Southeast Asian neighbor, Vietnam; also faces difficulties due to the effects of alleged Chinese-sponsored debt-traps and Chinese-backed militants in northern Myanmar territories.

In 2010, nearly 8000 acres of land was confiscated from residents to expand a Chinese-backed copper mining project. In November 2012, peaceful villagers protesting against the Letpadaung Copper Mine were attacked by police and Chinese workers. In the attacks, police used white phosphorus military munitions, resulting in burns and injuries to dozens of protesters including monks. The protests were due to coercion and intimidation of villagers to sign contracts the contents of which they were not allowed to read and misrepresentation of essential terms of the contract by falsely promising villagers that the land would be returned to them in three years, undamaged and in the same condition. In 2015, Amnesty International discovered that a waste leak from the Letpadaung Copper Mine had run into nearby fields, severely contaminating it.

Increasing trade and military cooperation with India and developing bilateral relations with Japan and within the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) shows a shift in Myanmar's foreign policy to avoid excessive dependence on China. However, by 2018 India's involvement in Myanmar was still limited compared to China's political and economic influence in the country.Stokke, Kristian; Vakulchuk, Roman and Indra Overland (2018) Myanmar: A Political Economy Analysis.

Following international condemnation of the Rohingya genocide, observers have noted that Myanmar has tightened its relations its relations with China. In May 2018, China condemned Myanmar's government after violence in northern Myanmar erupted. The violence was started by a China- backed militia, rebelling against Myanmar. The militia, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, sought to get more autonomy from the Burmese central government. In October 2018, militias backed by China against Myanmar expelled numerous clergies in northern Myanmar, sparking outrage throughout Myanmar. The Chinese-backed militia also threatened northern Myanmar residents from expressing their religious beliefs, even inside their homes. In August 2018, various international organizations found a staggering rise in Chinese projects in Myanmar, which may cause ‚Äòdebt traps‚Äô against Myanmar, the same way it was perceived as causing a debt-trap against Sri Lanka. Despite these reports, Myanmar's government continued with the Chinese loans and programs in November 2018, causing wide public concern. In February 2019, Myanmar pursued more Chinese-sponsored loans and programs. In July 2019, UN ambassadors from 50 countries, including Myanmar, have signed a joint letter to the UNHRC defending China's treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang region.

She was one of the founding members of the Association for Women in Mathematics in 1971.Boston Globe Obituary via Legacy.com Early life Alice Elizabeth Turner was born on June 18, 1915, in Richmond, Virginia. She received a full scholarship to study at the University of Richmond. She was the only female mathematics major. At the time, women were not allowed in the campus library. She was a brilliant student and won the department's James D. Crump Prize in mathematics in her junior year. She completed her B.A. degree in mathematics in 1936. For three years Alice was a secondary school teacher, accruing savings to pay for graduate school. At University of Chicago, Alice was a student of Ernest Preston Lane, author of Metric Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces (1940) and A Treatise on Projective Differential Geometry (1942). Alice studied differential geometry of curves and implications of the singular point of a curve. When a curve has null binormal, it is planar at that point. Another type of singularity is an inflection point. Duke Mathematical Journal published her work in 1944.A.T.

In 1942 Turner married Richard Schafer, after both had completed their doctorates. They had two sons. Academic career After completing her Ph.D., Alice Schafer taught at Connecticut College, Swarthmore College, the University of Michigan and several other institutions. In 1962 she joined the faculty of Wellesley College as a full professor. Her husband Richard was working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, researching non-associative algebras. In 1966 he published a book on them which he dedicated \\"To Alice\\". As a teacher, Alice especially reached out to students who had difficulties with or were afraid of mathematics, by designing special classes for them. She took a special interest in helping high-school students, women in particular, achieve in mathematics. In 1971, Schafer was one of the founding members of the Association for Women in Mathematics. She was elected as the second President of the Association. \\"Under the leadership of its second president Alice T. Schafer, [AWM] was legally incorporated in 1973 and received tax-exempt status in 1974.\\" see page 16 Schafer was named Helen Day Gould Professor of Mathematics at Wellesley in 1980. She retired from Wellesley in 1980. However, she remained there for two more years during which she was chairman of Wellesley's Affirmative Action Program. After retiring from Wellesley, she taught at Simmons College and was also involved in the management program in the Radcliffe College Seminars. Her husband retired from MIT in 1988 and the couple moved to Arlington, Virginia. However, she still wanted to teach. She became professor of mathematics at Marymount University until a second retirement in 1996. Awards and honors Schafer received many awards and honors for her service to mathematics. She received an honorary degree from the University of Richmond in 1964. She was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1985. In 1990 the Association for Women in Mathematics established the Alice T. Schafer Mathematics Prize to honor her for her dedicated service towards increasing the participation of women in mathematics. In January 1998, she received the Yueh-Gin Gung and Dr Charles Y Hu Award for Distinguished Service to Mathematics, awarded by the Mathematical Association of America.

Built in 1889 to a design by Longfellow, Alden & Harlow, it is a prominent local example of residential Richardsonian Romanesque architecture. It has served as the principal building of the Longy School (now the Longy School of Music of Bard College) since 1937. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and included in the Follen Street Historic District in 1986. Description and history The Edwin Abbot House stands west of Harvard Square in western Cambridge, at the formerly five-way junction of Concord Avenue, Garden Street, and Follen Street. Follen Street and the eastern portion of Concord Avenue, both quiet residential streets, are isolated from the rest of the intersection by a pedestrian plaza just south of the house. The traditional front facade of the house faces south toward Follen Street, with its major entrance now in the modern addition facing the Garden Street/Concord Avenue intersection. The main block of the house is 2-1/2 stories in height, and is built out of a combination of gray and rust-colored rectangular granite blocks, with red sandstone trim. It is covered by a red slate hip roof. The front facade is divided into three basic sections, the most prominent a projecting polygonal bay topped by a pyramidal roof. The entrance is set in the center section, under a segmented stone arch. Trim beltcourses extend around the building, acting as both sills and lintels for windows. The interior includes a grand entrance hall with high quality woodwork and a grand staircase. The house was built in 1889 to a design by Longfellow, Alden & Harlow for lawyer and railroad executive Edwin Hale Abbot (1834‚Äì1927). It remained in the Abbot family until 1937, and has since then been home to the institution now called the Longy School of Music of Bard College. In the 1960s a modern addition was made to the north, designed by Huygens and Tappe; it houses the Pickman Concert Hall. The rooms of the mansion are used by the school for a variety of academic purposes, including offices and practice spaces.

The gable eaves have decorative brackets, and the ground floor windows on the front are topped by lintels adorned with small brackets. The house was built in 1846, not long after Orchard Street was platted for development. It was one of the first houses with Italianate elements to be built in the city, coming just one year after the style was introduced. The house was built by Joshua Fernald, a local master carpenter, and was located for convenient access to the Fitchburg Railroad depot (now the Porter MBTA station). It originally did not have a large front porch; a two-story porch with Victorian turned posts and balusters was added about 1890 (as seen in 1972 cultural survey photos); the present porch is a subsequent replacement.

It was built in 1891 by Multnomah County to house the Oregon National Guard. In 2000, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Following a $36.1 million renovation project that lasted from 2002 to 2006, the building home to the theater company Portland Center Stage which produces 11 productions each season. An estimated 150,000 visitors visit The Armory annually to enjoy a mix of classical, contemporary and world premiere productions, along with the annual JAW: A Playwrights Festival, and a variety of high quality education and community programs. Construction In the late 19th century, anti-Chinese sentiment, particularly along the West Coast of the United States, had led to anti-Chinese violence in Oregon and Washington. After violence turned to riot in some cases (such as in Seattle), the State of Oregon authorized construction of armories so that National Guard troops could drill, in an effort to prevent or control potential riots. The First Regiment Armory in Portland was completed in 1888, but was immediately deemed too small, and so an Annex was commissioned to give troops stationed there more space for maneuvers. Amenities included an underground firing range. Constructed in 1891, the annex was built in the Romanesque Revival style that was popular from 1880‚Äì1890 and is identified by massive stone cladding and semi-circular arcades. McCaw and Martin featured many Northwest quarry materials in the design.breweryblocks.com Portland Armory The annex is also an example of Castellated architecture. The fortress-like structure has a recessed arched entrance flanked by turrets above. The turrets have crenelated parapets and loophole vertical gun slots. . Uses The Armory circa 1914 Constructed with a truss system with no supporting pillars to block views or impede movement, the building was one of the few Portland buildings in the early 20th century that could handle large crowds. As a result, the building hosted exhibitions of early motion picture machines, conventions, reunions, recitals, concerts, and speeches by presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. In 1918, the new Municipal Auditorium (now called Keller Auditorium), designed with superior acoustics and comfortable seating, supplanted the Armory for concerts and speeches, though amateur boxing events were still held at the Armory. In 1928, the Portland fire marshal declared the building to be a fire hazard; nonetheless, the building continued to be used. From 1946 to 1948, the Armory was home to the Portland Indians of the Pacific Coast Professional Basketball League. In 1948, the building was used to take in refugees of the Vanport Flood which destroyed the town of Vanport in 1948. In 1968, the Blitz-Weinhard Brewing Company purchased the entire complex, demolishing the original Armory for a parking lot and using the Annex as a warehouse. Present use Portland Armory during renovationThe Armory Annex, now known as The Armory, was the last piece of property in Portland's Pearl District Brewery Blocks to be redeveloped. The Portland development firm Gerding Edlen had redeveloped surrounding properties utilizing sustainable building practices and, when they bought the Armory complex in 2000, they pledged to maintain the historical character of the building while redeveloping the property. The Armory now contains the 590-seat U.S. Bank Main Stage and 190-seat Ellyn Bye Studio. The reinvention of the building as an arts center was contemplated as early as 2002. The renovation cost $36.1 million. The Armory has become a significant case study for historic preservation and sustainable design. It received a Platinum Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification, becoming the first building on the National Register and the first in Portland to achieve Platinum certification. As of 2007, it was one of only two Portland buildings to attain that status.

The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, where it is incorrectly listed at 41 Orchard Street. Description and history The former Cambridge Almshouse is located in the northwestern corner of Cambridge, on the north side of Matignon Road between Matignon High School and the St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church. It is a large three-story stone structure with modest Greek Revival styling, set partly across the city line between Cambridge and Somerville. It has a central octagonal administrative section from which four wings of varying sizes radiate. It is built mostly out of slate blocks that were quarried from a ledge on site, with dressed dark granite corner quoining, and granite belt courses between the floors. The roof lines are pierced by rows of gabled dormers. The building was built in 1850, designed by architect Gridley J.F. Bryant and prison reform expert Rev. Louis Dwight. A similar design was used by Bryant for Boston's Charles Street Jail (built in 1848) and for the Deer Island Jail (1850). The building was the fifth and final instance of an almshouse built by the city. It was built on a farm purchased by the city in 1849 for the purpose of establishing a poor farm. The property was sold to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston in 1927, which operated a school and convent on the premises. (The archdiocese continues to operate Matignon High School, but sold the adjacent church, now St. Sava, in 2006.)

The species was discovered by Dr. Jack Barnes of Cairns, Australia, who, while on an exploration mission aimed at determining the reason for Irukandji syndrome, allowed himself to be stung by the jellyfish, while his 14-year-old son and a lifeguard looked on. The jellyfish was later named after him. Carukia barnesi is a soft-bodied marine organism. This species falls within the Medusozoa subphylum and the Cubozoa class. It is a type of \\"box jellyfish\\" that is known for producing potent venom and is known for inflicting the Irukandji syndrome. Threat to Humans: The Irukandji syndrome was first discovered after a group of swimmers were stung in the open water near North Queensland, Australia. Victims of the sting reported severe symptoms of muscle aches, back pain, nausea, headaches, chest and abdominal pains, sweating, high blood pressure and difficulty breathing. Intravenous administration of pethidine is used to treat patients with this syndrome. Most reported incidents have been localized to Australia during the warm summer season. Due to the small size of C. barnesi (approximately 20 mm in diameter and 25 mm in depth of the bell), they often go undetected in the open water.  Description  The structure of C. barnesi follows that of a Box Jellyfish- it has a square-shaped bell structure and long tentacles that extend out of its base. The tentacles house the nematocysts which are stinging cells. Type I nematocysts (homotrichous microbasic rhopaloids) and Type II (homotrichous haplonemes) nematocysts are both found on the tentacles and bells of the species. These cells are also capable of producing venom that changes composition as C. barnesi matures to adulthood. Studies with SDS gel- electrophoresis have found that the protein composition of the venom increased as these jellyfish altered their prey from invertebrates (zooplankton and crustaceans) to vertebrates. C. barnesi feeds by stinging its prey through nematocysts and injecting venom. Once the prey is paralyzed and in captivity, muscle cells in the tentacles will aid the jellyfish to bring food closer to its mouth. At the mouth, the food can enter a gastric cavity and be digested.  Life cycle  Cubozoans follow a life cycle that alternates between young benthic sessile polyps and adult motile pelagic medusae. The cycle begins with a planula larvae. This planula will continue to swim until it finds a substrate that it can use as support. Once the planula attaches to a substrate like a coral reef or rock, the organism will morph into a polyp. This polyp can remain asexual for extended periods of time. Eventually, the polyp will begin to clone and form a polyp colony. As it continues to acquire nutrients, the colony will develop into an adult medusa.

The primordial beast is killed in the creation myth, but from its marrow, organs and cithraThe precise meaning of this word in this context is unknown. It is traditionally translated as \\"seed\\", which in the sense of \\"prototype\\" carries the connotation of a particular physical form or appearance. But the word can also mean \\"seed\\" in the sense of a \\"race, stock\\", which Gavaevodata - as the primordial animal - is the apical ancestor of. the world is repopulated with animal life. The soul of the primordial bovine - geush urvan - returned to the world as the soul of livestock. Although geush urvan is an aspect of the primordial bovine in Zoroastrian tradition, and may also be that in the Younger Avesta, the relationship between the two is unclear in the oldest texts. In scripture Although Avestan gav- \\"cow\\" is grammatically feminine, the word is also used as a singular for the collective \\"cattle\\". In English language translations Gavaevodata is often referred to in gender-neutral terms as \\"primordial ox\\". Other translations refer to Gavaevodata as a bull.cf. The -aevo.data of the name literally means \\"created as one\\" or \\"solely created\\" or \\"uniquely created\\". Gavaevodata is only alluded to in the surviving texts of the Avesta, referred to by name in only two hymns. In other instances, for example in Yasht 13.85, the primordial beast is mentioned among the six material creations, but not by name. Elsewhere, such as in the Gathic Avestan Yasna Haptanghaiti, prayers are offered on behalf of the soul of the cow (geush urvanYasht 35), or worship is offered to \\"the cow's soul, and to her created body\\",Yasht 39 but in neither case is Gavaevodata mentioned by name, nor is it clear (unlike in Zoroastrian tradition) whether the soul of the cow is the soul of Gavaevodata. This is also the case for The Cow's Lament.Yasna 29b In this allegorical text, the soul of the cow (geush urvan) despairs over the wretched condition to which the forces of deceit (druj) have subjected her (see myth, below), and over her lack of protection from an adequate herdsman. The divinities hold council, and decide that Zoroaster is the only one who can alleviate her condition. At first she laments even more, holding Zoroaster to be incompetent, but finally accepts his assistance. At least two levels of meaning have been inferred from this text (): The maltreated creature symbolizes the plight of Zoroaster's community, and the soul of the primordial beast is a metaphor for the message that Zoroaster has received from Mazda. In verse 3 of the litany to the moon,Mah Niyayesh 3 Gavaevodata is invoked as (or together with) the \\"bovine of many species\\" in the care of the moon Mah, specifically m√•≈ãha- gaociŒ∏ra- \\"the moon that keeps in it the cithra of cattle,\\" which is a stock epithet of Mah.Yasht 7.3, 7.5, 7.6, Gbd VIe.2-3, VII.5-6 etc. In the 30 hymns to the divinities of the Zoroastrian calendar month, Gavaevodata is again invoked in the verses nominally dedicated to the Moon. Mah is again referred to as \\"the Moon containing the cithra of cattle\\", and Gavaevodata is again referred to as (or in the company of) the \\"Bovine of many species.\\"Siroza 1.12, 2.12 In tradition The mythology of the \\"uniquely created bovine\\" that is only alluded to in the extant Avesta appears fully developed in the 9th‚Äì11th century Middle Persian texts of Zoroastrian tradition. In these texts, Avestan Gavaevodata appears as Middle Persian gaw i ew-dad or ewazdad or ewagdad, and retains the same literal meaning as the Avestan language form. As also for all other Zoroastrian cosmological beliefs, the primary source of information on the primordial ox is the Bundahishn, a 9th century text. In this text, the primordial ox is a hermaphrodite, having both milkIbd 43.15 and semen.Ibd 94.4 It is \\"white, bright like the moon, and three measured poles in height\\".Gbd Ia.12 The uniquely created ox lived its life on the river Veh. Daiti,Gbd Ia.12 and on the opposite bank lived Gayomart/d (Avestan Gayo maretan), the mythical first human. Gawi ewdad's role in the creation myth runs as follows: During the first three-thousand year period, Ahura Mazda's (Ormuzd) fashioned the bovine as His fourth or fifth of six primordial material creations. At the beginning of the second three-thousand year period, Angra Mainyu (Ahriman) attacked the world, and the Creator responded by placing the primordial plant, bovine, and human in the respective heavenly spheres of the stars, moon, and sun.Ibd 7 But Ahriman assaulted the sky and Ormuzd fed the bovine \\"medicinal mang\\" (mang bƒì≈°az) to lessen its suffering.Gbd IV.20 The bovine immediately became feeble, and then died. But as it lay dying its chihr was rescued and carried to \\"the moon station\\". In the care of the moon, the chihr of the beast was purified and became the male and female pairs of the animals \\"of many species.\\" After the bovine's death, fifty-five kinds of grain and twelve kinds of medicinal plants grew from its marrow.Ibd 10 In another passage,Ibd 93.11, c.f. an equivalent passage in Zadspram. the Bundahishn speaks of sesame, lentils, leeks, grapes, mustard, and marjoram issuing from various other parts of its body. For example, lentils from the liver, and mustard from the lungs.Ibd 14.1, Gbd XIII.2. Goshorun (from Avestan geush urvan), the soul of the primordial bovine, escaped to the star, moon, and sun stations where she lamented the destruction of the world. She was not placated until Ormuzd shows her the fravashi of the yet-unborn Zoroaster (whose protection she would receive). Contented with the promise of protection, Goshorun then agreed to be \\"created back to the world as livestock.\\"Gbd IVa.2ff, Ibd 46.3ff., Denkard p.9 See also *Au√∞umbla, a primeval cow in Norse mythology *Sacred bull *Tauroctony *Dema Deity Notes References Bibliography *. *. *.

The series was published between 1995 and 1998 by Simon & Schuster's Young Adult imprint Simon Pulse and followed Nancy and her friends as they attended college and dealt with issues such as date rape and drug usage. Nancy Drew on Campus utilized reader interaction, most notably in the first two books where they were asked to call a 1-800 number to decide whether Nancy and her boyfriend Ned were to break up or stay together. Nancy Drew ends her relationship to Ned Nickerson in the second book in the series, supposedly based on reader feedback to the telephone poll in the previous book. This series focused more on romance and problems facing teens than on mysteries. A large group of new characters was introduced and became the focus of story-lines during the run of the series. Nancy Drew works as a reporter for the school newspaper and becomes involved in minor mysteries, often the sub-plot or tertiary plot of the book. The larger secondary cast takes center stage as they deal with drugs, potential pregnancy, date rape, and other incidents that are the staples of the genre. The series was cancelled in 1997, when Simon & Schuster decided to cancel all Nancy Drew & Hardy Boys spin-offs. Synopsis The series followed Nancy and her friends George and Bess as they attend the fictional Wilder University. Nancy is attending in order to receive a degree in journalism, much to the chagrin of her longtime boyfriend Ned Nickerson, who wants her to attend Emerson College with him instead. Despite initial attempts to make their relationship work, the two break up in the second book On Her Own after Nancy decides that Ned is too controlling.

In her book Sisters, Schoolgirls, and Sleuths, Carolyn Carpan commented that the series was \\"more soap opera romance than mystery\\" and that Nancy \\"comes across as dumb, missing easy clues she wouldn't have missed in previous series\\".

The gable rake edges are adorned with jigsawn bargeboard, a detail repeated on the gabled dormers piercing the roof. The area was historically the estate of jurist Francis Dana, which was divided among his heirs after his death. The main mansion was sold out of the family at that time, and burned down in 1839, spurring family members to sell buildable lots from their holdings. This house and the nearly identical house next door were both built in 1839. They exhibit fairly typical modest Greek Revival elements, but also include early examples of Gothic detailing in the bargeboard, and in an applied-wood Gothic arch over the window in the street-facing gable end.

Set atop Avon Hill southwest of Porter Square, this subdivision, laid out about 1870, contains a concentration of the finest Victorian and Second Empire residential buildings in the city. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history Avon Hill was originally known as Jones Hill, and was used agriculturally from the mid-17th to mid-19th centuries. The five acres at the top of the hill were sold for development in 1869 to Henry Melendez and Gilbert Dexter, two prominent local businessmen. Each built a fine Second Empire house on Washington Street; that of Melendez survives, while Dexter's burned down in 1939. The area was built out by 1890 with architecturally distinguished houses on large landscaped lots, mainly for the owners of local businesses. Four of the houses were designed by the prominent firm of Hartwell & Richardson, while a number of the others were designed by other local architects. Only two houses in the district were built after 1900. The historic district extends along Washington Street between Upland and Lancaster Streets, and along Lancaster Street most of the way east to Massachusetts Avenue. It also includes all of Walnut Street, most of Arlington Streets, and a few houses on Agassiz and Humboldt Streets, and on Hillside Avenue, all of which abut one of the other streets. There are 44 properties, all residential. Most of them are large 2-1/2 story wood-frame buildings; one building has brick walls, while another has a combination of brick and wooden finishes. All were originally built as single-family dwellings, but some have since been divided internally into multiple living units.

Now on the campus of Harvard University, this large Greek Revival wood frame house was built in 1833 for Professor Charles Beck, and was later purchased and adapted by the physically disabled Henry Clarke Warren, a Sanskrit scholar. Since 1899 it has belonged to Harvard University, for whom it presently houses offices. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The Warren House stands in the eastern part of the Harvard campus, on the west side of Prescott Street, as part of an entire city block (just east of Harvard Yard) of Harvard-owned buildings. It has a 2-1/2 story main block, which is covered by a front-facing gable roof, with single-story side-gabled wings extending to the sides that are flush with the front facade. The main facade faces west, into a pedestrian area providing access to the other Harvard buildings on the block. The main block's corners are pilastered, while those of the wings have wooden quoining. The gable is fully pedimented, with a half- round window at the center. A single-story porch extends across the central three bays, its flat roof and entablature supported by smooth Doric columns. The interior features a distinctive blend of Greek Revival and Colonial Revival features, the latter done during the ownership of Henry Warren, handicapped by a spinal deformity from childhood. The second-floor alterations were particularly made to adapt to his needs. The house was built in 1833 by Charles Beck, a Professor of Latin at Harvard. It was built on land that was previously part of the large estate of Francis Dana and subdivided by his heirs. It was acquired in 1891 by Henry Clarke Warren, serving as his home until his death in 1899. Warren made numerous alterations to the interior to accommodate is physical disability, including an overly sized heating system which he was said to run up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The house was purchased by Harvard in 1899. When first acquired, it was used to house the philosophy library, and then the English department. It was moved in 1900 (within its historic lot) to make room for the construction of the Harvard Union to the south. Since 1997, it has served as offices for other Harvard organizations.

Built in 1874 as a speculative venture, they typify the housing built for low and middle-income workers in the 1870s. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Bennink-Douglas Cottages are located in an densely built residential area between the Cambridge Common and the Radcliffe Quadrangle, on the south side of Walker Street. The four buildings are each 1-1/2 story wood frame structure on brick foundations, with mansard roofs that provide a full second floor. Each cottage is four bays wide, with two entrances in the center bays and polygonal projecting window bays in the outer bays, rising through the mansard level. The steep sections of the roofs feature hexagonal slate shingles. Three of the four have bracketed hoods sheltering the entrances; the fourth had its porch rebuilt in the Colonial Revival style. The roof eaves also have paired Italianate brackets. The four cottages were built in 1874 as a speculative venture by Gerritt Bennink and William Douglas for sale as low-to-middle-cost housing for workers. Their style was typical of low-cost housing built during the 1870s throughout Cambridge, a period in which the city experienced rapid growth; by the late 1880s, the triple-decker became a more common low-cost construction. The exteriors of these four buildings have, for the most part, retained their original appearance. The land on which they were built was subdivided for development in 1868; it had been pasture land before then.

Description and history Berkeley Street is located west of Cambridge Common in western Cambridge, running parallel to and south of Concord Avenue between Craigie Street and Garden Street. Land in this area was acquired by Harvard University professor Joseph Worcester in 1843, and laid out for subdivision in 1852. Most of the houses on Berkeley Street were built between 1852 and 1872, for people prominent in business, culture, and politics. Berkeley Place, a dead end street projecting southerly from Berkeley Street, was laid out in 1890; it was originally a back lane to the Longfellow House, which was Worcester's home in the 1840s. Most of its houses date to the period between 1892 and 1918. When the district was first listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, it included 15 properties on Berkeley Street. Most of these houses are in the fashionable Bracketed Italianate style of that time, with a number of examples of the Second Empire style. A few later houses, built in the Queen Anne style, are sympathetic to the earlier houses in massing and style. Four years later the district was expanded to include most of the properties on Berkeley Place. Stylistically, they are a cross section of styles fashionable at that time: Queen Anne, Shingle, and Colonial Revival.

The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history Bigelow Street consists of one long city block, extending north from Massachusetts Avenue to Harvard Street west of Central Square. The street was laid out in 1868 by Albert Vinal, a local real estate developer. Vinal sold off the building lots to various builders, who almost completely built the street out by 1874. The resulting streetscape, which extends to include a portion of the adjacent block of Inman Street, is somewhat uniform in terms of scale and setback, and consists almost entirely of housing in the Second Empire style.

He excelled in Chinese painting and oil painting. He was one of the four pioneers of Chinese modern art who earned the title of \\"The Four Great Academy Presidents\\". Overview Liu Haisu Art Museum His original given name was Pan, courtesy name Jifang, and sobriquet Haiwong. He excelled in oil painting, ink painting (guohua) and art education. He was devoted to painting at an early age. He entered a painting school in Shanghai directed by Zhou Xiang to learn western painting when he was 14 years old. In 1910 he opened a painting school in his county. In November 1912, together with Wu Shiguang and Zhang Yunguang, he founded the first school of fine arts in modern China, Shanghai Academy of Chinese Painting (), the former Shanghai School of Fine Arts (). He initiated co-education, and pioneered the adoption of nude model and open-air painting, and thus was scolded as an \\"artistic traitor\\", though he was supported by scholars such as Cai Yuanpei. He lectured in Beijing University and held his first personal exhibition in 1918. He went to Japan to explore education of fine arts in 1919, and founded Tianma Party upon returning to China. He went to Japan in October 1920 to attend the opening ceremony of Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, and after he returned, he wrote \\"Biography of Jean-Fran√ßois Millet\\" and \\"Biography of Paul C√©zanne\\" to introduce western arts into China. He visited Japan again in 1927 and made the acquaintance of Japanese painters. He was a teacher of Pan Yuliang, a Chinese female artist who brought Western influence into Chinese painting. Biography Statue of Liu Haisu in front of Liu Haisu Art Museum Liu loved painting from a very young age and went to Shanghai for professional studying alone at 14. When he was 17, he established the first art school of modern China‚ÄîShanghai institute of Fine Art with his friends, Wu Shiguang and Zhang Jinguang. Later he started coeducation and used nude models to teach paintings. He was the first man to do such things in China and it caused a lot of controversy. People called him a traitor of the arts. However, he got support from Cai Yuanpei, the principal of Peking University. In 1918, he began teaching at Peking University and held his first solo exhibition. In the same year, he also founded the ‚ÄúArt‚Äù magazine. In 1919, he went to Japan to study painting and art education and attended the first art exhibition opening ceremony of the Art School of the imperial Japan. After returning home, he founded an institute‚ÄîÂ§©È©¨‰ºö. In 1920, he went to Japan once again. He participated in the opening ceremony of the new imperial Art School on behalf of the arts. In 1924, one of his students held an exhibition in Nanchang featuring nude art. This greatly disturbed Sun Chuanfang, who issued a secret warrant for Liu's arrest and tried to close down his school. However his efforts were futile, since the school was based in the French area of Shanghai, where Sun had no authority. Liu still had to pay a fine to appease the warlord. The event made the concept of nude modeling public knowledge in China. In 1927, he was forced to go to Japan because of the political persecution. Asahi Shimbun once assisted him to hold solo exhibitions in Tokyo. In 1938, he went home. During 1918~1988, Liu climbed Mount Huangshan ten times. His most important works were mostly focused on Huangshan. In addition, he went to Europe twice. He communicated with famous painters, such as Picasso and Matisse. He made great contributions to the development and spread of Chinese painting. In 1994, he died in Shanghai. Family Liu Haisu had four wives in his lifetime. His first marriage was arranged by his parents. He showed great disagreement with the arranged marriage and left home for Shanghai, where he met his second wife‚ÄîZhang Yunshi (), then 17 years old. Soon, they had their first son‚ÄîLiu Hu (). In 1933, Liu married Cheng Jiahe () and had a son () and a daughter. In 1944, he married his fourth wife‚ÄîXia Yiqiao (), a student of his.

History In 1904, Cistercian monks were forced to abandon the Fontgombault Abbey in Indre, France, after a 1901 secularist-driven French law had given the government control over non-profit associations and threatened the existence of monasteries. In late summer and fall of 1904, under the direction of their abbot, Dom Fortunat Marchand, six Trappist monks from Fontgombault arrived in Oregon and bought about of land near Jordan on which to build a monastery. Half of the acreage was cultivated farmland and the rest was woodland and brush. On a tributary of the Santiam River that formed the southern boundary of their property, they built a steam sawmill. There the Douglas-fir timber was converted into lumber for the use of the community and to sell. The monks also grew a variety of produce, including cereal crops, vegetables, pears, plums, and apples. One of the brothers won prizes at the Linn County Fair for his vegetables. In 1905, a dozen more men arrived. Over the next six years, as many as 35 American men tried to join the monks but they \\"found conditions too primitive or precarious, and all but one abandoned the idea\\". The monastery was dedicated in 1907 by the Archbishop of Oregon City, Alexander Christie. The Right Rev. Father Thomas Aq. Meienhofer, Abbot of the Benedictine Abbey of Mount Angel, preached the dedicatory sermon, in which he explained the nature and the object of the life of the Cistercians, or Trappists. The monk's ventures were hampered by the language barrier and a \\"severe lack of business experience\\". The high costs of hauling logs also contributed to the monk's financial problems. They tried a dairy, but high interest on loans in the post Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War era left them in debt. The monks remained hopeful, but their superiors did not tell them about their dire financial situation. The sawmill burned down. Upon hearing initial rumors of closure by Trappist superiors in Kentucky, a monk named Father George started a campaign to keep the monastery going. During a 1908 visit from the Kentucky abbot, however, the superior saw the debris from the fire and the monks' financial struggle. Despite Father George's demonstrative pleading during the superior's visit, in 1909 the monks were ordered back to France. When a letter from Trappist superiors in Rome arrived and explained the reasons for the order, Father George wrote a letter of submission. Some monks returned to France, but others became Benedictines or priests of the Archdiocese of Oregon City. The Archdiocese of Oregon City (today part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland) took on the monks' debts for a time, and later the Benedictines of Mount Angel took over and resolved the finances. When the Trappists' abbot contracted tuberculosis, the Providence Sisters in Portland took him into their hospital and cared for him for a year free of charge. A group of Benedictine women in Idaho then took over from the sisters and cared for the abbot for the rest of his life.

Early life  Al-Qattan was born in Beirut, Lebanon to Palestinian parents. His father, Abdel Mohsin al-Qattan, came from Jaffa, which his family fled with thousands of other Arabs as a result of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, becoming refugees. His mother, Leila Miqdadi, originally from Tulkarem, also fled Palestine with her family in 1948. Omar's parents met and married in Kuwait, where they started their careers as schoolteachers, before Abdel Mohsin first joined the Kuwaiti government as a senior manager and then started his own construction company. The family were naturalised in 1964 before moving to Beirut in 1975, where Omar lived until he was eleven years old. In 1975, the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War, drove the family to scatter and Omar was sent to England where he attended boarding school. Upon graduation from high school in 1982, he spent seven months in Cairo studying Arabic & Islamic literature and history, following which he gained a BA in English Language and Literature from the University of Oxford. After graduating, he enrolled in INSAS film school in Brussels.  Filming career  Al-Qattan began his filming career by directing 15 to 20-minute documentaries and dramas while at film school, including his first documentary Je suis...tu es? (1987) and his first drama La Danse (1988), followed by the award-winning tragicomedy Tale of the Blind Man and the Paralytic in 1989, shown on Canal+. Al-Qattan also continued his close association with the eminent Palestinian director Michel Khleifi, who was initially his teacher at INSAS and with whom he went on to co-produce a number of films. His first full-length film, Dreams & Silence, was a documentary released in 1991. The film portrayed a Palestinian woman refugee in Jordan and her struggles with the religious and social constraints around her at a time of great tension and anguish during and after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The documentary received the Joris Ivens Award and was broadcast in five European countries and Australia. In that same year, Al-Qattan settled in London where he founded, in partnership with Khleifi, Sourat UK in 1992, which later become Sindibad Films Ltd in 1993.Omar Al-Qattan Sindibad Films. The company produced Tale of the Three Jewels (1995) and Forbidden Marriages in the Holy Land (1996). the former was the first feature film to be entirely shot in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and received several international awards after its premiere at the Director's Fortnight, Cannes. The latter is a documentary about mixed marriages between Jews and Arabs in Palestine/Israel. 1995 also saw the release of Going Home, a documentary on Derek Cooper, a British veteran of the Palestine Mandate, which focused on the central role of memory and justice in the process of reconciliation and was shown on Channel 4 TV. Sindibad Films also developed pioneering educational CD-Roms during this same period. In 2000 and 2001 Al-Qattan also co-directed Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet, a two-hour documentary on Muhammad's life and his legacy with Muslims in the United States. Produced by Unity Productions Foundation, it was aired on American television by PBS on December 22, 2002. The film was criticized by some right-wing journalists as \\"too soft on the topic\\", but it won great acclaim by the US public. However, Al-Qattan took issue with the final film, which he only partially directed and which he found too bland and conformist. During this period, Al-Qattan began to give increasing attention to the A. M. Qattan Foundation, an independent institution established by his parents to support cultural and educational development in Palestine and the Arab World, launching its principal activities and establishing its operations in the Occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip through three major tracks: the Qattan Centre for Educational Research & Development which supports school teachers to develop and improve their professional skills and knowledge; the Qattan Centre for the Child in Gaza City, a cultural centre for children under the age of 15 including a major library, theatre, IT lab and other facilities, including a mobile outreach programme; and the Culture & Arts Programme, a pioneering and diverse funding mechanism for the arts, particularly among young people which is today one of the largest - and most prestigious - independently funded programmes of its kind in the region, working across the disciplines, including film and television, including the Palestinian Audio- visual Project and the Gaza Music School. In late 2008, the Programme also opened The Mosaic Rooms, a gallery and small cultural space in London focused on Arab culture which Al-Qattan continues to curate. The Foundation is today considered a pioneer and leader in its fields, both regionally and internationally. Returning to cinema in 2008, Al-Qattan produced Khleifi's ZINDEEQ, winner of the best feature at the 2009 Dubai International Film Festival. Al-Qattan is also a published writer and commentator and, since 2012 chair of the Palestinian Museum steering committee of the Welfare Association and of Shubbak 2013, the festival of contemporary Arab culture in London. Since 2005, he has also been deputy chair of Al-Hani Construction and Trading in Kuwait, the family firm established by his father in 1964.

J. Daniel, was an American lawyer, businessman, civic leader, and newspaper publisher. He was born and lived most of his life in Jacksonville, Florida, where he led the effort that resulted in the Jacksonville Consolidation of 1968, which combined city and county governments to improve services. He was known in his lifetime as one of the city's and state's most politically powerful people. Early life, family and education Jaquelin James Daniel, known as J. J., was born in 1916 into a powerful Jacksonville, Florida family. His great-grandfather was a young lumberman turned attorney who migrated to Florida in 1846. His grandfather, for whom he was named, was a colonel in the Civil War and became one of the most influential citizens of postwar Jacksonville. He was also a principal in the prestigious Jacksonville law firm Fleming and Daniel. The colonel reorganized the Chamber of Commerce and served as President of the Citizens' Auxiliary Association before dying in 1888 in Jacksonville's yellow fever epidemic. Daniel's father was a prominent lawyer and leader in the Urban League. Daniel attended local segregated schools and earned his undergraduate degree at Princeton University, where he also played football. He received his law degree in 1942 from the University of Florida. He served as an officer in the U.S. Navy in World War II and took part in the Invasion of Normandy.Bulkley Jr., Captain Robert J. At Close Quarters; PT Boats in the United States Navy, Pickle Partners Publishing, November 6, 2015. After the war, he joined his father‚Äôs Jacksonville law firm. Career In 1960, Daniel became the president of Stockton, Whatley, Davin & Co., one of the largest mortgage banking and real estate firms in the Southeast. In addition, from 1976 until 1982, Daniel was publisher of both the Florida Times-Union and Jacksonville Journal. (His paternal grandfather, in 1888, became the first president of Florida Publishing Company, original owner of the Florida Times-Union. The company bought the Jacksonville Journal in 1959.) Consolidation In 1966 the Florida legislature created the Local Government Study Commission to develop a plan to merge Jacksonville city and Duval County services and government, at the request of city leaders. They were dismayed by widespread corruption and waste in local government during the 1960s, when numerous city elected and appointed officials were indicted, as were some county officials. Daniel was named to lead this effort. He was known for his integrity, strong leadership, and history of civic involvement. He and the commission developed a proposal for consolidation that was put before the voters of Jacksonville, other jurisdictions, and unincorporated areas of Duval County. It was strongly approved and implemented in 1968. A few small jurisdictions maintained their independence from the consolidation, with some later procuring services from the new government. At the time, it became the only consolidated government in the state of Florida and one of the few at the time in the nation. In reviewing John Fischer's Vital Signs, Time noted that according to Fischer, \\"[t]he hero of the consolidation of Jacksonville, Fla., where the voters in five municipalities chose to form one central government, is an enthusiastic oligarch named J.J. Daniel, who got his way simply because 'he knew almost everybody of consequence in the community.'\\"Time Magazine: May 12, 1975-Signs of Vitality Influence and later years In 1977, the St. Petersburg Times described Daniel as \\"a pillar of the North Florida business and political establishment...probably Jacksonville's most respected citizen\\" and named him as one of the ten most powerful people in the state.Florida Times-Union: February 21, 1999-Power: You know it when you see it J. J. Daniel served on the Florida Board of Control from 1957-1961 and the Florida Board of Regents from 1971-1982. He was chairman of both boards and was instrumental in getting the University of North Florida established in Jacksonville. The administration building at the school was named J. J. Daniel Hall and dedicated to his memory in February 1991, following his death. He was influential in establishing the Episcopal High School of Jacksonville. He also served on many non-profit boards, including the American Red Cross, the District Welfare Board, and the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce. Jaquelin James Daniel died in 1990.

It formed within the monsoon trough just off the coast of Costa Rica on May 29. Initially forecast to remain a weak tropical storm, the cyclone rapidly strengthened and developed an eye before making landfall in Nicaragua near Le√≥n with peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Alma was the first tropical storm on record to strike the Pacific coast of Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, heavy rainfall caused flooding and landslides, killing two and causing $35 million (USD) in damage. Three people were killed in Nicaragua, one from drowning and two others from electrocution. Five others died in Honduras from an aviation accident likely related to the storm and one other was swept away in floodwaters. Meteorological history Towards the end of May 2008, computer hurricane models forecast the development of a broad low pressure area to the southwest of Central America. On May 26, a large trough extended from the southwestern Caribbean Sea across Costa Rica into the eastern Pacific Ocean, forming a broad low pressure area across the region. A scattered area of strong convection developed, partially in association with the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Located within an area of weak steering currents, the disturbance remained nearly stationary, and on May 27 its shower activity increased in organization. Initially the system consisted of several cyclonic swirls, of which the most pronounced one was located about 340 miles (550 km) west-southwest of San Jos√©, Costa Rica. The system gradually became better organized, and with a sufficiently well- developed circulation and convective structure, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression One-E at 0300 UTC on May 29, about 105 miles (165 km) west-northwest of Cabo Blanco, Costa Rica. With a mid-level ridge located in the Gulf of Mexico, the depression drifted generally northward through an area of warm water temperatures and low wind shear. Initially its convection was weak and confined to a few rainbands far from the center. As such, intensification was not expected beyond minimal tropical storm status. However, the system quickly developed intense thunderstorms near the center with increased banding in its southern semicircle, and at 1500 UTC on May 29 the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Alma, about 55 miles (85 km) southwest of Managua, Nicaragua. Its intensity was set at 45 mph (75 km/h), and the storm was forecast to intensity only slightly more before moving ashore. However, one hour after it was upgraded to tropical storm status, the NHC re-assessed the intensity as 65 mph (100 km/h), citing updated observations from satellite imagery and QuikSCAT. An eye feature formed, surrounded by a very tight ring of convection, and at around 1900 UTC on May 29 Alma made landfall near Le√≥n, Nicaragua as a strong tropical storm. The storm quickly weakened after moving ashore, though a small area of thunderstorms persisted as it crossed into the mountainous region of southern Honduras. After passing near Tegucigalpa Alma weakened to tropical depression status, and at 1500 UTC on May 30 the cyclone dissipated near the border of Honduras and Guatemala. On May 31, after crossing Central America as a low pressure area, Alma's remnants moved into the Gulf of Honduras and spawned Tropical Storm Arthur. Preparations and impact Arthur Coinciding with the first advisory on the depression, the government of Costa Rica issued a tropical storm warning for the entire Pacific coast of the country. About four hours prior to landfall, when Alma was named, a tropical storm warning was in effect for the entire coastlines of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador. When it was realized the storm was much stronger than previously thought, a hurricane warning was issued for the coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras, and Alma was forecast to attain hurricane status. Prior to moving ashore, the NHC warned that the storm could produce up to 20 inches (500 mm) of rainfall, resulting in mudslides and flash flooding. The National Emergency Commission of Costa Rica activated emergency shelters prior to the arrival of the storm; 250 people in Parrita evacuated from their homes. In Nicaragua, officials evacuated about 5,000 people, while 3,000 troops were mobilized to assist in the aftermath of the storm. When Tropical Storm Alma made landfall it produced moderate to heavy rainfall across Central America. The city of David, Chiriqu√≠ in western Panama reported 5.75 inches (141 mm) of precipitation in 48 hours. Additionally, the capital city of San Jos√©, Costa Rica reported 3.07 inches (78 mm) of rainfall in a 48‚Äëhour period. In Costa Rica, the precipitation caused river flooding, threatening 17 communities. It also caused widespread mudslides, which closed at least eight roads. The storm downed trees and power lines, leaving about 42,000 people without electricity in the country. Two deaths were reported in the country, and damage in Costa Rica was estimated at about ‚Ç°20 billion col√≥nes ($35 million 2008 USD). In Le√≥n near where it moved ashore in Nicaragua, the passage of Alma left the city without power. Several buildings were destroyed in the city, and some roads were damaged. Much of the departments of Le√≥n and Chinandega experienced power outages, due to the strong winds. One person died from electrocution, due to a downed high-tension cable, and another person died in a similar manner. Offshore, one person drowned when he rode out the storm in his boat. In Tegucigalpa, TACA Flight 390 skidded off a runway sodden by torrential rain, killing three passengers (plus two more on the ground) and injuring over eighty. One other fatality was reported in Honduras when a young girl was swept away in a raging stream. Records and retirement Satellite image of Alma shortly before attaining tropical storm status Forming at 86.5¬∫W, Alma developed farther east than any other Pacific tropical cyclone on record. Excluding systems crossing in from the Atlantic, only eight other systems, Francesca in 1970, Bridget and Priscilla in 1971, Jimena in 1979, Paul in 1982, Cristina in 1996, Rosa in 2000, and Selma in 2017, developed east of 90¬∫W. Alma made landfall farther east than any other Pacific tropical cyclone, and it was the only to do so on the Pacific coast of Nicaragua. When the storm formed on May 29, it marked the ninth year in a row when a Pacific tropical cyclone formed in May, which was the most consecutive years in which storms formed in May. Alma's remnants contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Arthur in the Atlantic. Despite having a relatively minimal impact on land, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Alma from the list of Pacific hurricane names and replaced it with Amanda for the 2014 Pacific hurricane season. This makes Alma one of only three tropical storms to have had its name retired in the eastern Pacific; the others were Hazel in 1965 and Knut in 1987.

The tower was named in honor of George H. Denny, who served as university president from 1912 to 1936 and then again in 1941. It is equipped with a 25-bell carillon. The tower is one of the most visible landmarks on campus. History The idea of erecting a bell tower on the University of Alabama campus was initially suggested in 1919. It was envisioned as a war memorial for those who fought in World War I. Due to a lack of funding for its construction, the project never materialized. In the late 1920s, university students were finally successful in collecting the necessary funding to construct a tower, although not as a war memorial. It was done in an effort to dedicate the structure to university president George Denny, after learning of a rumor that he was looking to leave the university and return to his native Virginia. The tower was built by Skinner, Maxwell and Company at a final cost of $40,000. It was dedicated on May 27, 1929, with Governor Bibb Graves in attendance. Design The tower is Art Deco in design. The square white limestone base features pilasters at each corner, with a recessed bay in between. The base is crowned by a molded cornice, which in turn is topped by an eagle, with partially outstretched wings, perched at each of the four corners, where the limestone base transitions to the brick shaft. The base supports a red brick shaft that gradually tapers to a limestone crown featuring a belfry with square pillars separated by partially open neoclassical grills, all topped off by a stepped pyramidal roof of limestone. The limestone was quarried in Alabama, while the bricks are from Virginia, in honor of Denny's home state. Carillon The carillon features 25 cast bronze bells, with the largest having a circumference of about and a height of . The Westminster chimes ring every 15 minutes, chiming on the hour in addition to chiming other songs or the alma mater as part of university celebrations or holidays. Inside the base is an automatic player that plays roll music in addition to a keyboard console that is used on special occasions. By 1945, the bell carillon was converted into an electronic system and modernized in 1966. For many years, the Alabama organ professor Warren Hutton served as the carillonneur for memorial services and special events, and today the manual organ is played by both university faculty and students.

Named after King Alfonso XIII of Spain, the ship was not completed until 1915 owing to a shortage of materials that resulted from the start of World War I the previous year. The Espa√±a class was ordered as part of a naval construction program to rebuild the fleet after the losses of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War; the program began in the context of closer Spanish relations with Britain and France. The ships were armed with a main battery of eight guns and were intended to support the French Navy in the event of a major European war. Despite the reason for the ships' construction, Spain remained neutral during World War I. Alfonso XIIIs early career passed largely uneventfully with routine training exercises in Spanish waters, though she was used to assist civilian vessels in distress and to suppress civil unrest in Spain. In the 1920s, she took part in the Rif War in the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, where her sister was wrecked. In 1931, Alfonso XIII was deposed and the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed; the new republic sought to erase remnants of the royal order, and so Alfonso XIII was renamed Espa√±a. As part of cost-cutting measures, the ship was then reduced to reserve. Plans to modernize Espa√±a and her sister in the mid-1930s came to nothing when the Spanish coup of July 1936 initiated the Spanish Civil War. At the start of the conflict, the crew murdered the ship's officers and attempted to resist the Nationalist rebels in Ferrol, but after the Nationalists seized coastal artillery batteries, they surrendered. Espa√±a then became the core of the Nationalist fleet and she was used to enforce a blockade of the north coast of Spain, frequently patrolling and stopping freighters that attempted to enter the Republican-controlled ports of Gij√≥n, Santander, and Bilbao. During these operations on 30 April 1937, she was fatally damaged when she accidentally struck a mine that had been laid by a Nationalist minelayer. Most of her crew was evacuated by the destroyer before Espa√±a capsized and sank; only four were killed in the sinking. The wreck was discovered and examined in 1984. Design Line-drawing of the Espa√±a class Following the destruction of much of the Spanish fleet in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898, the Spanish Navy began a series of failed attempts to begin the process of rebuilding. After the First Moroccan Crisis strengthened Spain's ties to Britain and France and public support for rearmament increased in its aftermath, the Spanish government came to an agreement with those countries for a plan of mutual defense. In exchange for British and French support for Spain's defense, the Spanish fleet would support the French Navy in the event of war with the Triple Alliance. A strengthened Spanish fleet was thus in the interests of Britain and France, which accordingly provided technical assistance in the development of modern warships, the contracts for which were awarded to the Spanish firm (SECN), which was formed by the British shipbuilders Vickers, Armstrong Whitworth, and John Brown & Company. The vessels were authorized some six months after the British had completed the \\"all-big-gun\\" , and after discarding plans to build pre-dreadnought-type battleships, the naval command quickly decided to build their own dreadnoughts. Alfonso XIII was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of ; her freeboard was amidships. The ship displaced as designed and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of four-shaft Parsons steam turbines driving four screw propellers, with steam provided by twelve Yarrow boilers. The engines were rated at and produced a top speed of . Alfonso XIII had a cruising radius of at a speed of . Her crew consisted of 854 officers and enlisted men. Alfonso XIII was armed with a main battery of eight 50-caliber guns, mounted in four twin gun turrets. One turret was placed forward, two were positioned en echelon amidships, and the fourth was aft of the superstructure. This mounting scheme was chosen in preference to superfiring turrets, as was done in the American s, to save weight and cost. For defense against torpedo boats, she carried a secondary battery that consisted of twenty guns mounted individually in casemates along the length of the hull. They were too close to the waterline, however, making them unusable in heavy seas. She was also armed with four 3-pounder guns and two machine guns. Her armored belt was thick amidships; the main battery turrets were protected with the same amount of armor plate. The conning tower had thick sides. Her armored deck was thick. Service history Early career Illustration of an Espa√±a-class battleship by Oscar Parkes The keel for Alfonso XIII was laid down at the SECN shipyard in Ferrol on 23 February 1910 and her completed hull was launched on 7 May 1913. Fitting-out work was delayed by the start of World War I in July 1914, since much of the equipment, including her guns and fire-control systems, were supplied by British manufacturers that were now occupied with production for the British war effort. Alfonso XIII was completed on 16 August 1915, albeit with an improvised fire-control system that was secured through neutral countries. After Italy, a member of the Triple Alliance, declared neutrality at the start of the war, Spain followed suit, since the participation of its fleet in the pre-war agreements with Britain and France had been predicated on the need to reinforce the French fleet against the combined Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies. After entering service, Alfonso XIII sailed with her sister to Santander, where the ship's namesake, King Alfonso XIII was aboard his yacht Giralda. The two battleships then took part in training exercises off Galicia. At the end of the year, Alfonso XIIIs crew won the Spanish Christmas Lottery. The peacetime routine of the Spanish fleet included training exercises, frequently held off Galicia, and a fleet review off Santander during the King's usual summer vacation there. The year 1916 passed uneventfully until September, when Alfonso XIII joined the search for the destroyer , which had encountered severe weather in the Bay of Biscay and had been disabled by storm damage. The battleship assisted the tugboat Antelo in April 1917 after the latter vessel had run aground off Cabo Prior. The tug had been carrying a load of mines, which Alfonso XIII took aboard to lighten Antelo so she could be pulled free. By this time, socialist and anarchist groups in Spain campaigned for a general strike and a revolution against the monarchy, prompting the military governor of Bilbao to request Alfonso XIIIs presence to help restore order in August. The ship's landing party went ashore to guard a rail line and several mines. In a clash with revolutionaries, one man from the ship's crew was killed and several were injured, while twenty-two revolutionaries were arrested and held aboard the ship. Alfonso XIII again helped to suppress striking workers in early 1919, when, after having sailed to Barcelona for the commissioning of the submarine , she arrived in the midst of the La Canadiense strike against the Barcelona Traction company. Alfonso XIII again sent men ashore to protect the company during the strike that lasted for forty-four days. In 1920, the Spanish Navy embarked on a series of long-distances cruises to show the flag, in part to demonstrate its growing power. Alfonso XIII was sent to tour the Caribbean Sea and visit the United States, departing Ferrol for Havana, Cuba, by way of a stop in the Canary Islands on 22 June. On arriving in Havana on 9 July, she met an enthusiastic reception that belied the Cuban rebellion against Spanish rule in the 1890s. Alfonso XIII then steamed to Puerto Rico, which had also been part of the Spanish colonial empire until the war of 1898, and where the ship was also warmly received. The ship also visited Annapolis in the United States; the unprotected cruiser , a former Spanish cruiser that had been captured during the war with the United States and commissioned into the US Navy, flew the Spanish flag to honor her visit. Alfonso XIII concluded the tour with a stop in New York City in mid- October, after which she re-crossed the Atlantic, arriving back in Spain in November. In April 1921, the ship visited Lisbon, Portugal, during ceremonies held to commemorate the country's soldiers who had been killed during World War I. Rif War Throughout the early 1920s, she provided naval fire support to the Spanish Army in its campaigns in Morocco during the Rif War that had broken out in mid-1921. At the start of the conflict on 16 July 1921, Alfonso XIII was operating on the northern coast of Spain. She took on a full stock of coal at Santander on 22 July and immediately got underway to provide gunfire support to Spanish forces in the colony. She arrived off Melilla on 10 August and began shelling rebel positions the next day. Her landing party went ashore to reinforce the Spanish soldiers in the area. On 17 September, she and Espa√±a bombarded Rif positions south of Melilla while Spanish Foreign Legion troops assaulted the positions. Alfonso XIII continued to operate off the coast of Spanish Morocco through 1922, including a bombardment of Rif artillery batteries that were being used to target coastal shipping. The batteries scored several hits on the ship, but she was not significantly damaged and her crew suffered no casualties. In August 1923, she participated in the first combined arms operation in Spanish military history that included aircraft, warships, and ground forces operating together. The fleet was used to support an amphibious assault at Melilla. On 26 August, during the operation, Espa√±a was wrecked off Cape Tres Forcas. Alfonso XIII came alongside to take off her crew, ammunition, and other supplies to lighten the vessel so she could be pulled free. Over the next year, work continued to refloat the vessel that ended in failure when a storm destroyed the ship in November 1924. During this period, tensions over the European colonial holdings in North Africa‚Äîpredominantly stoked by Italy's fascist leader Benito Mussolini over the perceived lack of prizes for Italy's eventual participation in World War I on the side of the Entente‚Äîhad led to a rapprochement between Italy and Spain in 1923, which was at that time ruled by the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera. Primo de Rivera sent a fleet consisting of Alfonso XIII, her sister , the light cruiser , two destroyers, and four submarines to visit the Italian fleet in late 1923. They departed Valencia on 16 November and stopped in La Spezia and Naples, arriving back in Barcelona on 30 November. By 1925, the Rif rebels had widened the war by attacking French positions in neighboring French Morocco. Spain and France planned a major landing at Alhucemas, consisting of some 13,000 soldiers, 11 tanks, and 160 aircraft, to attack the core rebel territory in September. The Spanish Navy supplied Alfonso XIII, Jaime I, four cruisers, the seaplane tender D√©dalo, and several smaller craft, with Alfonso XIII serving as the Spanish flagship. The French added the battleship , two cruisers, and several other vessels. Both fleets provided gunfire support as the ground forces landed on 8 September; the amphibious assault was a success, and after heavy fighting over the next two years, the Rifian rebels were defeated. Decommissioning and planned modernization After completing the annual training routine in 1927, Alfonso XIII embarked her namesake and his wife Victoria Eugenie in September for a cruise along the coast of Galicia. They returned to the ship in October to visit Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa, where rebellions against Spanish rule had recently been suppressed. Alfonso XIII was escorted by the cruisers Reina Victoria Eugenia and and the destroyer . Alfonso XIII participated in a fleet review with British, French, Italian, and Portuguese warships during the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition that began in May and continued until January 1930. By this time, the effects of the Great Depression had spurred significant domestic opposition to the regime of Primo de Rivera, leading to his resignation on 28 January, and ultimately to Alfonso XIII's exile in April 1931. On 17 April, three days after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, the new government ordered Alfonso XIII renamed Espa√±a. Immediately thereafter, the new government began a series of cost-cutting measures to offset the deficits that had been incurred during the Rif War, and as a result, both Espa√±a and Jaime I were placed in reserve in Ferrol on 15 June 1931. Espa√±a was decommissioned on 15 November and remained out of service for the next five years, during which time some of her secondary battery and anti- aircraft guns were removed for use ashore. By the early 1930s, the warming of Spanish relations with Italy proved to be short-lived, owing to Alfonso XIII's choice of Rome as his residence in exile and the Spanish government's preference for republican France over Fascist Italy. Plans to modernize the Espa√±a-class battleships traced their origin to the 1920s, but the increased risk of conflict with Italy by the mid-1930s put increased pressure to begin the work. One proposal, advanced in 1934, advocated rebuilding the ships into analogs to the German s with new oil-fired boilers. The ships' hulls would have been lengthened, and the main battery turrets rearranged so they would all be on the centerline. The ships' secondary batteries would have been replaced with dual-purpose (DP) guns. The plan ultimately came to nothing, the result of financial weakness during the Great Depression and continued political instability. The finalized plan for Espa√±a and Jaime I involved increasing the height of the wing turrets' barbettes, improving their fields of fire and allowing them to fire over the new secondary battery, which was to consist of twelve 120 mm DP guns placed on the upper deck in open mounts. A new anti-aircraft battery of either ten or eight guns were to be fitted. Other changes were to be made to improve fire-control systems, increase crew accommodation spaces, and install anti-torpedo bulges, among other improvements. Work was slated to begin in early 1937, and a limited refit was conducted in 1935‚Äì1936 in preparation for her recommissioning. Her fore and aft turrets were restored to operational status (though the wing turrets remained out of service) and her boilers were re-tubed. The scheduled modernization was interrupted by the Spanish coup of July 1936, which plunged the country into the Spanish Civil War. Spanish Civil War and loss Illustration of Espa√±a (formerly Alfonso XIII) in 1937 When the coup, led by Francisco Franco, against the Republican government began on 17 July, Espa√±a was at anchor in Ferrol, in use as a barracks ship. After a brief period of uncertainty, Lieutenant Commander Gabriel Rozas, the acting commander of Espa√±a, ordered a landing party to go ashore, though he refused to explain his intentions, prompting elements of the crew to murder Rozas and several other officers. They then went ashore to assist the Republican forces attempting to break into the Ferrol Arsenal, then held by Nationalist rebels. They were repulsed by Nationalist fire and returned to the ship. Some army detachments, including some coastal artillery units around the harbor, sided with Franco. The destroyer also defected to the Nationalist side. An artillery duel between the batteries and Velasco on the Nationalist side and Espa√±a and the cruiser , the crew of which also decided to side with the government, resulted in considerable destruction in the harbor and significant damage to Velasco. After two days of fighting, the crews of Espa√±a and Almirante Cervera reached a negotiated settlement with the Nationalists who had gained control of the harbor, surrendering their vessels to the Nationalists. With the shipyard under Nationalist control, work began to ready Espa√±a for offensive operations as quickly as possible. She set sail on 12 August; by that time, her wing turrets were still not operational, and she carried only twelve of her 102 mm guns. The crew was composed of volunteers and cadets from the Escuela Naval Militar (Naval Academy) in Mar√≠n. In company with Almirante Cervera and the repaired Velasco, she patrolled the coast of Cantabria and enforced a blockade of the northern coast of Spain. The Republican government designated the ships as pirate vessels on 14 August, while they patrolled as far east as the French border. On 15 August, Espa√±a bombarded Republican positions in Gij√≥n, which housed significant industrial resources. She and Almirante Cervera then shelled fortifications in Gipuzkoa that blocked the advance of Nationalist forces; over the span of the next few days, she fired 102 shells from her main battery. The ship returned to Ferrol on 20 August, where her port wing turret was returned to service. Spain's northern coast during the war, showing the location of Gij√≥n, Santander, Bilbao, and San Sebasti√°n; Espa√±a base at Ferrol lies further to the west On 25 August, Espa√±a sortied in company with Velasco to make further attacks on the Republican-held coast between Santander and San Sebasti√°n. They captured the Republican freighter () on 26 August and later seized the small fishing boat Pe√±as (209 GRT) before returning to Ferrol on 1 September. She sortied again to bombard Gij√≥n again shortly thereafter and arrived back in Ferrol to be dry-docked for maintenance on 14 September. In response to these attacks, the Republicans sent a flotilla of five submarines from the Mediterranean, though one was sunk by Nationalist forces en route. They also briefly deployed Jaime I, a pair of light cruisers, and six destroyers to Gij√≥n, arriving on 25 September, but the squadron departed already on 13 October without having engaged Espa√±a or any other elements of the Nationalist fleet. Espa√±a was still dry-docked during this period, and she was ready to go to sea again by mid-October. On the 21st, she captured a pair of fishing boats‚ÄîApagador (210 GRT) and Musel (165 GRT)‚Äîand on 30 October, she seized the freighter (3,314 GRT). Early that morning, while Espa√±a was on patrol, the submarine launched four torpedoes at the ship in two attacks, but all four missed. The battleship seized another freighter the next day: (2,667 GRT). Espa√±a underwent a refit in November that included the installation of four German-supplied SK C/30 anti-aircraft guns and their corresponding fire- control directors and a pair of Flak 30 autocannon. She returned to service by December for further attacks on the Republican coast. On 20 December, she attacked El Musel, the port of Gij√≥n, where the Republican destroyer and other Republican vessels were anchored. She was joined in the attack by Velasco and the auxiliary cruisers and , though they failed to sink the Republican ships. On 30 December, Espa√±a shelled the lighthouse at Cabo Mayor near Santander. Republican bombers attacked Ferrol in early January 1937 but inflicted little damage. At the same time, the Republicans laid a series of defensive minefields off Gij√≥n and Santander. Espa√±a captured the Norwegian freighter (3,105 GRT) on 22 January and three days later, she seized the coaster Alejandro (345 GRT). The ship, escorted again by Velasco, carried out another bombardment of Bilbao in February. Espa√±a seized the Republican freighter with a cargo of iron ore on 13 February. After returning to Ferrol, she once again entered the dry dock for maintenance that lasted until 3 March. Another patrol along the northern coast followed immediately after Espa√±a emerged from the dry dock and on 8 March, she stopped the freighter (2,733 GRT). While on patrol on 30 March, she encountered Jos√© Luis D√≠ez but neither side pressed the attack. The next day, she captured the merchant ship (3,481 GRT); during the seizure, a group of Republican aircraft attacked the ship but inflicted no damage. She also came under fire from coastal artillery that day, but again emerged unscathed. The battleship returned to shell El Musel on 13 April in another failed attempt to sink Jos√© Luis D√≠ez. During her patrols in March and April, she repeatedly encountered units of the Royal Navy that had been sent to ensure that British-flagged vessels safely passed through the Nationalist blockade. A pair of these incidents took place on 30 April; while searching for blockade runners off Santander, Espa√±a and Velasco encountered the British steamer , which was fired upon by Espa√±a and forced to sail away, assisted by the destroyer HMS Forester. Later that morning, at around 07:00, the Nationalist vessels spotted the British steamer . Velasco fired warning shots to force the freighter to alter course, but when Espa√±a turned to support Velasco, she inadvertently entered one of the minefields that Nationalist minelayers had set in an attempt to block the port. She struck one of the mines at 07:15, which detonated against her port side engine room and boiler room, tearing a large hole in the hull and causing significant flooding. Espa√±a took on a list to port but remained afloat for some time, which allowed Velasco to come alongside and evacuate most of her crew, apart from three men who had been killed by the mine explosion. A fourth man died of his wounds aboard Velasco. During the evacuation, Republican aircraft launched three strikes on the vessels, but anti-aircraft gunners aboard both ships successfully drove them off. By around 08:30, Espa√±as crew had been taken off. Her list was increasing, and by the time Velasco departed, her decks were awash. Shortly thereafter, she capsized to port and sank. Wreck In May 1984, divers from the Spanish Navy's salvage vessel located Espa√±as wreck at a depth of about , lying upside down, displaying the large hole created by the mine explosion. Contemporary, official reports from the Nationalist government claimed that the sinking had been the result of a Republican mine that had broken loose from its mooring, but an examination of the wreck proved that it had been a Nationalist mine, making the loss of Espa√±a one of the largest self-inflicted casualties in naval history. Several proposals to raise the wreck to be scrapped have been made since her discovery, but the cost of such an enterprise have prevented any work being done.

Its world premiere was in Prague on 13 October 1995 at the Prague Congress Center (formerly the Palace of Culture), with Daniel H≈Ølka in the title role. It was immediately called the Czech musical of the century. The musical is very loosely based on Bram Stoker's 1897 novel, Dracula. The musical was performed very successfully between 1995 and 1998, and then again from 2003. The musical was performed in a new production at the Hybernia Theater in Prague between 5 February 2009 and 28 May 2011. The director of both the original and the new production is Jozef Bedn√°rik. The musical is also featured on several recordings. The first CD was released in 1995 with Daniel Landa in the role of Dracula, but he resigned shortly after the premiere. A complete 2 CD musical recording was released in 1997. A selection CD with Daniel H≈Ølka, Iveta Barto≈°ov√° (Adriana/Sandra) and Leona Mach√°lkov√° (Lorraine) in the main roles was released in 2003. New CDs and 2DVD with full recording of the musical were released in 2009. Dracula was also successful in foreign theaters, such as in Germany, Korea and Belgium. A CD and DVD recording of the performances in Belgium was released in 2005. The musical was significantly edited for the Belgian theatres. The story takes place in the fifteenth century, in the nineteenth century and in an unspecified near future.  The story  15th century The story begins in the 15th century with farmers who seek protection in a monastery. They are running from Count Dracula's \\"Black Knights\\", and Dracula himself (Mercy). The priest tells the farmers not to worry, and that Dracula wouldn't dare touch a monastery. A young monk disagrees, doubting Dracula's values. The priest scolds him for not having faith in the power of Christ (Stand Up, My Brother). Dracula, of course, doesn't mind the fact that it is a monastery. He robs it and orders his Knights to kill everyone (Black Knights). The monk tries to stop him and protests Dracula's actions. But Dracula kills him without a second thought. The priest is furious and curses Dracula, saying \\"Even if he prays for death, he will never receive it, not even by his own hand. And his lips, reddened by bloodshed, will now thirst only for that same blood,\\". In the meantime, the Countess Adriana, Dracula's pregnant wife and love, is sad about not seeing her Count. She asks the court jester to take her mind off of it and to cheer her up. He does so by pointing out a butterfly in the castle, and saying that it's a terrible \\"intruder\\" (The Jester and Adriana). Then, Dracula and Countess Adriana sing \\"Vim, ze jsi se mnou\\" (I Know You're With Me), where they express their love for one another, saying that even with the great distance, nothing changes. They say that \\"the first flame, the first days of hope, the first touches of bonding,\\" will be in them forever. Dracula returns home, satisfied with his \\"mission\\". For a while he jokes around with the jester, saying that his task in life is to \\"clean the earth from all the unworthy filth\\" (Bowl and Cord). When he arrives to Adriana, she is dying from complications of child birth. Dracula learns that their newborn son is also dead. He is furious with the midwives, and shouts at them for not calling the doctor. The jester, who despises his master, answers that he had run to get the doctor, but the doctor wasn't there, because he was at the monastery Dracula had attacked. This infuriates Dracula beyond all thought. He orders the knights to put the jester in the stocks, to have a \\"long, cruel\\" night. He then yells at the rest to disappear from his line of sight. Once he is left alone, he prays for Adriana to wake again (To Eternal Gates). When that doesn't happen, he blames God for her death (Unfair God). After some accusations shouted at God, he tries to commit suicide. No matter how many times he tries, his wounds instantly heal without scarring. This is when he learns that the curse from the priest is very much real; he is immortal (Dracula's Realization of his Immortality). Instantly euphoric, he throws a huge celebration and calls back his jester, so that everyone is merry. Then he learns the second part of the curse, when he accidentally sucks all the blood from a young village girl, to the horror of everyone else (Loving). 19th century The story fast forwards to the 19th century (Intermezzo 1840). Dracula is now living in his castle with three \\"nymphs\\" (who eternally love him), his servants, and the main servant (played by the same man as the jester)(Nymphs). He is depressed with the immortality and still thinks of no one but his beloved Adriana (Living). A young girl, Lorraine, his poor and orphaned relative, seeking refuge before her father's will is solved by lawyers, comes to his castle. She is first afraid of the castle, and all the woods surrounding it. But once she meets Dracula, she intends to stay. They agree on meeting in the garden during the next day (A Mysterious Castle). The three nymphs, jealous, try to persuade Dracula to behave as he normally would, and drain her blood out (Jealousy). Dracula resists and hopes that with this new-found love, his curse will be lifted. The voice of the priest reminds him that that is not to be. Dracula does not come to the garden the next day, and instead sends his servant with a necklace and an invitation to a ball. At first, Lorraine is angry that the Count did not come, but accepts the gift (Date in the Garden). In the meantime, Lorraine's brother, the young abbot Steven, comes to the castle to look for his sister. He suspects Dracula of being behind the murders of girls and women in the land. Before the ball, everyone who is invited is wondering why a ball is being held when it is the wrong season for such events. They try to pry the information out of the servant, but he does not give them any reasons. Their bickering is interrupted by the arrival of Dracula himself with Lorraine on his arm, wearing his necklace (Vampire Waltz). During the ball they both disappear, probably to Dracula's bedroom. Other ballguests hide behind their masks that they are also vampires and other various beasts. The ball alters to an orgy. Shocked, Steven watches and is dragged into their dance. The servant saves him from being killed and then wonders out loud if he should finish him off or help him. He also speaks of the relationships between masters and their servants (The Servant and Time). He lets Steven live, but keeps him prisoner (Steven's Monologue). Lorraine then sings the famous \\"Jsi m≈Øj p√°n\\" (You Are My Lord), where she describes how Dracula is the only thing important in her life now. She has completely and hopelessly fallen for him. A few days later, Dracula and Steven meet. Steven is angry that he was kept a prisoner and wants to take his sister away. Lorraine comes and assures him that she is happy with the Count. Steven tries to kill Dracula, but the wound instantly heals. Once they have learned of the immortality, Steven kills himself out of desperation. Now aware of what the Count really is, Lorraine begs him to also make her a vampire, saying that there is no point in her life without him. Unhappily, he complies (The Deed is Done). The townsfolk chases Dracula, nymphs and Lorraine, but the servant is able to lead them away and vampires escape (Hunt for the Evil). Near future First we meet the Stockers, a motor gang whose leader is Nick and his girlfriend Sandra. Sandra looks very similar to Adriana (and is played by the same actress). Nick promises her that their last heist will be looking at a casino, which is owned by Dracula (Stockers). Dracula, in these days, has a trusted Professor (another incarnation of Jester/Servant) interested in his case, who helps him monitor his health (Dehibernation). Lorraine is becoming an alcoholic, and slowly realizes that Dracula cares for her less and less (Empty Casino). She persuades the Professor to take her to his lab, where she has been denied entrance by Dracula. They go to the lab, only moments after Nick, who takes a photo of Adriana's painting and runs away. When Lorraine sees Adriana's portrait she loses all interest in the machine and realizes that it's possible that Dracula loves someone else (Revelation). The nymphs and other workers of the casino delightedly watch the growing problems between Dracula and Lorraine (Mischievous Nymphs). Nick stole the same dress that Adriana had on in her portrait, for Sandra (Pygmalion). They visit the casino, and Sandra is wearing Adriana's dress. Dracula thinks that Adriana has returned and is instantly smitten, forgetting all about Lorraine. Lorraine makes a jealous scene, but Dracula tells her that Adriana is \\"my eternal love, and I'm sick of you!\\" (Casino Show) After Dracula's hurtful words, Lorraine understands that her sacrifice was in vain (Lorraine in the Dungeon). Sandra, who has had enough of trying to be sexy for men that treat her with no respect, is charmed by Dracula's sweet and sincere words, and decides to meet with him (Sexy Every Day). Dracula once again expresses his love for her (Profession). Sandra tries to explain the truth to him, but Nick interrupts them and takes Sandra away. Dracula is furious and chases after them. When other Stockers on motorbikes come, the Professor puts himself in front of the Count to save Dracula's life and loses his own (The Chase / Ruining the Casino). Dracula, with nothing left to him but pain, is finally allowed to die. He has to have a final judgment, with all of those whom he has hurt. This goes from the priest, the village girl, Lorraine, Sandra, everyone. The characters accuse him of how much he hurt them, only Lorraine and Jester finding some defence for Dracula. Sandra has her chance to explain that she is not Adriana (The Dream Court). Lorraine, knowing there is nothing left here for her, decides to join him in death. Dracula asks Sandra to let the sun into his room, killing both him and Lorraine (Draculas's Death).  Cast  *Dracula ....

Currently, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ranks the department 4th nationally in ophthalmology research funding and 1st in the Midwestern United States and Chicago metropolitan area. Located in the heart of the Illinois Medical District, the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary is the major referral center in the Chicago metropolitan area for eye emergencies as the only Level 1 eye trauma center in the region. The General Eye Clinic also serves as the only emergency eye clinic in all of Chicago. The Chicago Curriculum in Ophthalmology (CCO) meets at the Infirmary where all Chicago area ophthalmology residents are invited. Furthermore, the Illinois Eye Review is held at the Infirmary. The Infirmary is one of the oldest hospitals of its kind in treatment of disorders of the eye, ear, nose, throat, and head/neck. The Infirmary houses the departments of ophthalmology and otolaryngology of the University of Illinois College of Medicine. LASIK surgery was invented by Gholam A. Peyman, while he served as Professor of Ophthalmology at the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary. The Department of Ophthalmology has a NIH- funded K12 research program, one of only 7 in the United States. There are strong partnerships with global programs through Dr. Marilyn Miller, including exchange programs with Keio University in Tokyo and the Federal University of S√£o Paulo. Other programs exist with Nigeria, India, Brazil, Thailand, Iran, Philippines, Guatemala, and Nepal. The Millennium Park Eye Center is staffed by faculty affiliated with the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary. Over the past three decades, the ophthalmology department has been a leading recipient of funding from the National Eye Institute (NEI), part of the NIH.2006 funding data from NEI The Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences is one of the most competitive residency programs in the United States. The ophthalmology residency program is one of the most selective programs in the country with well over 600 applicants annually, of whom only 84 are granted interviews for 6 positions. The majority of exposure to refractive surgery during residency, including LASIK and PRK, occurs at the Millennium Park Eye Center. They also spend a rotation at the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, which is located a few blocks away. Lastly, residents perform as primary or assisting surgeon in all subspecialties including cornea, retina, and pediatric ophthalmology throughout their training and are involved with on call duties. The Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Illinois Eye and Infirmary is the oldest department of its kind in the U.S. and among the most competitive residency/fellowship programs in the country. The Department is nationally recognized for its outstanding care and leading-edge residency training program. It offers comprehensive care in seven specialty areas: Otology/Neurotology, Cochlear Implants, and Skull Base Surgery; Audiology/Hearing Loss; Head and Neck Cancer/Robotics/Microvascular Reconstruction (at the Head and Neck Cancer Center); Laryngology/Voice Disorders, The Professional Voice/Speech Care (at the Chicago Institute for Voice Care); Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery/Scar Revision; Rhinology & Skull Base Surgery Center; and General Otolaryngology. It maintains clinical facilities in the Eye and Ear Institute, as well as in the Michigan Avenue corridor in downtown Chicago. The nationally recognized UI Otolaryngology residency program has trained hundreds of outstanding clinicians and researchers. Resident physicians in the program rotate across multiple facilities during their time in the program: UI Hospital and Health Sciences System; Jesse Brown VA Medical Center; John Stroger Cook County Medical Center; Lurie Children's Hospital; Elmhurst Hospital/Memorial Center for Health; 900 N. Michigan Avenue Surgical Center; and NorthShore University Health System. History 19th Century The Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary was founded in May 1858 by a 30-year-old physician named Edward Lorenzo Holmes as the Chicago Charitable Eye and Ear Infirmary, the department predates the UIC College of Medicine. The Infirmary took up just a single room in a frame building at 60 North Clark Street in Chicago, and the first patient arrived before the room was even ready. That initial year of operation, the Infirmary had 95 eye patient visits. Most of the patients were afflicted with eye infections. The private organization was registered as an infirmary association, with a slate of officers and 12 trustees. An influential group of physicians and philanthropists guided the association until the state of Illinois took over the Infirmary's operations in 1871. The name then changed to the Illinois Charitable Eye and Ear Infirmary. (‚ÄúCharitable‚Äù later was removed from the name because paying patients also were accepted, and in 1874, the name became the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary.) The Infirmary was totally destroyed by the Chicago Fire of October 9, 1871. Temporary quarters were set up at 137 N. Morgan Street; in 1874 a new building was inaugurated at the corner of Peoria and west Adams street, at a cost of over $40,000. When the University of Illinois College of Medicine's predecessor, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Chicago, opened in 1882, the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary (IEEI) began its long academic affiliation with the University. However, several government officials thwarted efforts for years to bring the Infirmary into the University Hospitals system. Finally in 1943, the IEEI and the University formally agreed to joint operations. 20th Century In 1939, the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary began one of the nation's first glaucoma specialty clinics. In 1965, the Infirmary moved to the University's West Side Medical Campus, to its current location on Taylor Street. The University's Research and Education (R&E;) Hospitals still ran a separate ophthalmology service until 1970, when it was merged into the Infirmary's ophthalmology department. On October 19, 1965, new facilities for the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary were formally dedicated by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner, the result of efforts by Ophthalmology department head Peter C. Kronfeld, MD, Otolaryngology department head Francis L. Lederer, MD, and Lester R. Gerber, Superintendent of the Infirmary since 1946. Morton F. Goldberg, MD, head of ophthalmology from 1970 to 1989, increased full-time faculty from one to 25, added numerous ophthalmic subspecialty clinics and a postresidency fellowship program, and began a residency surgical rotation in Madurai, India. Dr. Gholam A. Peyman pioneered LASIK surgery at this time. During this period, the Lions of Illinois funded $5 million of the $6.8 million cost of building the Lions of Illinois Eye Research Institute‚Äîthe largest single donation ever given to the department. When the institute opened in 1985, it was heralded as the most comprehensive eye research center in the Midwest. In 1985, The Lions of Illinois Eye Research Institute (LIERI) opened at the University of Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary through a generous donation from the Lions Clubs of Illinois. The Institute is part of the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences and has research laboratories, offices, computer services, core facilities for machine shop, imaging, tissue culture and molecular biology research, and one of the largest ophthalmology libraries in the country. Research efforts at LIERI are supported by both private and national grant-funding agencies and by the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences. LIERI also houses patient care facilities in the Edwin and Lois Deicke Eye Center. While the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery existed for the better part of a century before 1933, in that year it became a freestanding department for the first time, headed initially by Joseph C. Beck, M.D., then in 1934 by Francis Lederer, M.D., who led the Department for 33 years. Dr. Beck had been Dr. Lederer's childhood physician and served as his mentor in clinical and administrative matters, as well as a leader in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Dr. Lederer joined the Department in 1922, served as its acting head in 1925, and became board-certified in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery in 1926. He contributed greatly to the institution and the field, including for his service during World War II, for which he was recognized by President Harry Truman. Author of the landmark book Diseases of the Ear, Nose, and Throat, Dr. Lederer was a mentor for many in the program who became leaders in the field, including Eugene Tardy, M.D. 21st Century Of the 31 Chicago ophthalmologists as Super Doctors, 11 were based at the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary. The Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary is currently chaired by Dr. Mark Rosenblatt, a cornea specialist. The Infirmary houses some of the world's most renowned ophthalmology faculty: 57 full-time and part-time ophthalmologists, as well as 18 ophthalmology residents, treat more than 60,000 patients and performs over 3,000 eye operations each year. Fellowships in ophthalmology span the following subspecialties: Cornea, Glaucoma, Neuro-ophthalmology, Oculoplastics, Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, and Vitreoretinal Disease. Research fellowships in artificial Cornea Research, Cornea Neurobiology & Ocular Surface Disease, and Oculoplastic pre-residency are also available. The Otolaryngology Department, offers services in six subspecialties - Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Speech and Voice Care, Sinus & Nasal Allergy, Oncology and Neurology, Cancer of the Head and Neck, and General Otolaryngology - treated nearly 17,000 patients in 2008, the most recent year for which statistics are available, making it one of the busiest programs in the country. Through generous donations, the Cless Family Ophthalmology Training and Simulation Center was also established recently at the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary. Notable Alumni and Faculty Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences David J Apple: responsible for the Miyake-Apple technique. This method of sectioning the cadaver eye was initially developed by Kansatu Miyake and refined by David Apple. The eye is dissected posterior to the posterior lens capsule and the anterior segment is mounted above a camera which allows observation of the IOL in-situ in the capsule from a posterior view: thus as though looking out on the world through the lens and cornea. Using this technique, Apple and his colleagues were able to analyse the performance of IOLs made of different biomaterials and different lens designs. Eugene R. Folk: founded the \\"Chicago\\" school of strabismus, whose ideas competed with and stimulated those of Marshall M. Parks, Arthur Jampolsky, and other prominent strabismologists Dr. Saul Merin Saul Merin: worked for 25 years with the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of retinal and genetic eye diseases. His book Inherited Eye Diseases is now in its second edition. Marilyn T. Miller: contributions include descriptions of ocular findings in Mobius syndrome, Parry-Romberg syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome. She described associations of Duane syndrome with craniofacial abnormalities, as well as dyslexia, thalidomide toxicity, and other first-trimester anomalies. In the 1990s, her study of eye motility problems in people affected by thalidomide contributed to research into the causes of autism. During her long career, Miller became known particularly for her interest in international ophthalmology. Along with administrative and educational work in this area, she has cared for thousands of patients around the world including Nigeria. Gholam A. Peyman: Dr. Peyman was awarded the first patent for LASIK, recipient of National Medical of Technology and Innovation, the nation's highest honor for technological achievement, bestowed by the President of the United States, President Obama, on America's leading innovators and a Hall of Fame of Ophthalmology and retina surgeon who is also a prolific and successful inventor. A member of National Academy of Inventors, he has been granted over 160 US Patents covering a broad range of novel medical devices, intra-ocular drug delivery, surgical techniques, as well as new methods of diagnosis and treatment. Maurice Rabb: founder of the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center at the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary with a colleague, after obtaining a grant from the National Institutes of Health. The center was the only one in the country to diagnose and treat sickle-cell eye disease. Rabb also led a research that helped prevent retinal detachment and blindness in sickle-cell patients.Howard Schatz: a prominent American ophthalmologist and photographer whose works are exhibited in prestigious museums and photography galleries internationally and are included in innumerable private collections. Schatz completed his medical degree at The University of Illinois College of Medicine, followed by an internship at Cook County Hospital in Chicago, ophthalmology residency at the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, and fellowship in vitreoretinal diseases at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Schatz has had seventeen monographs published of his photographs. H2O, Schatz's most recent book, published in 2007, is the third in his series of explorations of imagery made on, over and underwater. Schatz first established a following for this uniquely expressionistic underwater imagery in the 1990s with two collections of underwater photography, Water Dance and Pool Light. William F. Mieler: Former President of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) and Life Achievement Honor Awardee from the American Board of Ophthalmology (AAO) and served as its director, vice-chair and chair. He is a past president of the Macula Society, which awarded the 2013 J. Donald Gass Medal to him for his outstanding contributions to the study of macular disease. Currently serves as Director of Ocular Oncology Clinic, and Vice Chair of Education. He was formerly the director of the Residency and Vitreoretinal Fellowship at the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary. Mark O.M. Tso: Professor and Founding Chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Much of his early research concerned ocular pathologic findings in retinoblastoma and laser effects on the retina. Reza Dana: Resident alumnus at the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary; Currently serves as the Claes Dohlman Chair in Ophthalmology, Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, and Senior Scientist & W. Clement Stone Scholar at The Schepens Eye Research Institute, as well as the Director, Cornea & Refractive Surgery, Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirmary, Vice Chairman of Harvard Department of Ophthalmology, and Director of the Harvard Medical School Cornea Center for Excellence. Jennifer I. Lim: A leading authority on retina and vitreoretinal diseases, having performed more than 6,000 vitreoretinal surgeries and directed more than 50 clinical research studies and trials on age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, macular edema and retinal vein occlusion and complex retinal detachments. Her book, Age-Related Macular Degeneration, is in its 3rd Edition and was published 2013. Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery The Department has produced a litany of notable researchers, clinicians, and teachers over the years. They include: Francis Lederer, M.D. In addition to his work as the leader of the Department for 33 years, Dr. Lederer was a captain in the U.S. Navy Corps, contributing to military medicine (among the honors he earned was the Navy Commendation for establishing a rehabilitation program for blinded and hearing-impaired patients at Philadelphia's Naval Hospital) and helping secure the EEI's training relationship with the U.S. Veterans Administration, a relationship that continues today. His 1940s text Diseases of the Ear, Nose, and Throat was a standard teaching text used for many years, and he started the first speech and hearing center in any medical school at the University of Illinois in the years following World War II. M. Eugene Tardy, M.D. Preparing to enter residency training at the University of Iowa, he was serving in the U.S. Air Force when he came across Dr. Lederer's book and sought to meet the author. When he finally did meet Dr. Lederer, their three-hour discussion resulted in Dr. Tardy's decision to come to UI, which he joined as a resident in 1964. Dr. Tardy, a brilliant and pioneering facial plastic surgeon, inspired many patients and residents, and the Department conducts an annual lecture in facial plastic surgery and the humanities in his name. Dr. Tardy also served as president of the two major groups in the field, the American Academy of Otolaryngology ‚Äì Head and Neck Surgery and the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. Burton J. Soboroff, M.D. Dr. Soboroff, a widely respected head and neck cancer surgeon, served as interim head of the Department 1975-76 and 1977-79. Dr. Soboroff was widely admired as a clinician and teacher and was instrumental in developing and supporting resident research activities. Upon his retirement he established a lectureship in Otolaryngology that continues to this day. Edward L. Applebaum, M.D. chaired the Department for 20 years, from 1979-1999, expanding its reach and establishing a permanent full-time faculty that helped take the Department into the 21st Century. He helped shepherd the growth of cochlear implant services in the Department, now a leading service of its highly regarded Division of Audiology. He also became the first Francis L. Lederer Professor of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Dr. Applebaum also brought several clinical innovations to the field through his many inventions, including the Applebaum Incudostapedial Joint Prosthesis, still used in hearing recovery. Notable Research The Department has contributed greatly to research and innovation in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. Some of its contributions include: The Holinger-Brubaker Endoscopic Camera ‚Äì Paul Holinger, M.D., one of three generations of Holingers in the Department's history, developed a revolutionary means of capturing images used to diagnose and document patient conditions with a photographic engineer, Joseph Brubaker. The camera advanced endoscopic photography not only in otolaryngology and otology, but across many fields of medicine. Virtual/Three-Dimensional Temporal Bone Imagery ‚ÄìThis three-dimensional, virtual reality tool enabled medical students and residents to learn about the middle and inner ear outside of the surgical suite. Developed by Dr. Edward Applebaum and resident Ted Mason along with University of Illinois Biomedical Visualization staff, this innovation has contributed significantly to otology education and treatment. The Temporal Bone Laboratory and Virtual Tympanum ‚Äì Alongside Dr. Applebaum and Mason's innovation, the Department maintains the Galter Temporal Bone Laboratory, one of the best equipped such facilities in medical education. Further its research and educational goals, nearly 200 images of the tympanum were digitized and developed into an app for the iPad and Apple devices, thanks to the contribution of the late faculty member Richard Buckingham, M.D., in collaboration with current faculty member Miriam Redleaf, M.D. Innovative Imaging Studies in CT/MRI for the Head and Neck ‚Äì Galdino Valvassori, M.D. conducted many groundbreaking studies in the use of imaging technologies for diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Valvassori was known as the ‚ÄúFather of ENT Radiology,‚Äù and published three seminal texts: Radiographic Atlas of the Temporal Bone, Radiology of the Ear, Nose, and Throat, and the Valvassori Textbook of ENT Radiology.

Bush. The book was scheduled to be released on June 2, 2008; however, excerpts were released to the press a week before publication. The book quickly became a media sensation for its candid, insider's critique of the Bush administration and ran as a leading story on most top news outlets days after the content became public. It was listed as a number-one bestseller by the New York Times and on Amazon.com when it first went on sale.  Content  McClellan harshly criticizes the Bush administration over its Iraq war-making campaign, though he writes in detail about his personal admiration for President Bush. He accuses Bush of \\"self-deception\\" and of maintaining a \\"permanent campaign approach\\" to governing, rather than making the best choices. McClellan stops short of saying Bush purposely lied about his reasons for invading Iraq (in fact, stating flatly that he did not believe that Bush would intentionally lie), writing that the administration was not \\"employing out-and-out deception\\" to make the case for war in 2002, though he does assert the administration relied on an aggressive \\"political propaganda campaign\\" instead of the truth to sell the Iraq War. The book is also critical of the press corps for being too accepting of the administration's perspective on the Iraq War, and of Condoleezza Rice for being \\"too accommodating\\" and overly careful about protecting her own reputation.  Reaction  McClellan's transformation from White House Press Secretary to prominent critic was a shock to most political observers, and his public changeover \\"startled Washington\\".  White House reaction  The Bush administration issued a statement about the book through McClellan's successor, Press Secretary Dana Perino, who said, \\"Scott, we now know, is disgruntled about his experience at the White House. We are puzzled. It is sad. This is not the Scott we knew.\\" The administration additionally took exception to the claim that they had misled the nation in the lead-up to the war in Iraq, as Perino said, \\"He's suggesting that we purposely misled. There is no new evidence of that.\\"Washington Times - McClellan gives no new evidence  Congressional reaction  In response to the claims made by McClellan in the book, Congressman Robert Wexler (D-FL) and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who is the Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, have called upon McClellan to testify under oath in front of Congress. McClellan testified publicly under oath before the House Judiciary Committee in July 2008.  McClellan response  McClellan has responded by stating that his role as Deputy White House Press Secretary during the lead-up to the Iraq War was not to make policy,Washington Times - McClellan gives no new evidence contending that he was inclined to give the Administration the \\"benefit of the doubt\\" like most Americans, and that he did not fully appreciate the circumstances until after leaving the \\"White House bubble\\" and being able to reflect with a more clear-eyed view of events.  Sales  While McClellan's book advance was for a comparatively low $75,000, What Happened reached the number-one position on the sales chart of Amazon.com, and its printing was quadrupled to more than 300,000 copies by its publisher, PublicAffairs.

Named after King James I of Aragon, Jaime I was built in the early 1910s, though her completion was delayed until 1921 owing to a shortage of materials that resulted from the start of World War I the previous year. The class was ordered as part of a naval construction program to rebuild the fleet after the losses of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in the context of closer Spanish relations with Britain and France. The ships were armed with a main battery of eight guns and were intended to support the French Navy in the event of a major European war. By the time Jaime I was completed, the Rif War had broken out in the Spanish protectorate in Morocco and the ship was used to support Spanish forces fighting in the colony in the early to mid-1920s. She was placed in reserve in 1931 after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, but was reactivated in 1933 to serve as the fleet flagship. Plans to modernize the vessel in the mid-1930s came to nothing after the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936. Jaime I and the bulk of the fleet remained loyal to the republican government, though her sister Alfonso XIII (by then having been renamed Espa√±a, fell under rebel control). The Spanish Republican Navy nevertheless failed to make effective use of its naval superiority and Jaime I did not see significant action apart from bombarding Nationalist positions in North Africa. She was attacked twice by enemy aircraft during the war, and in June 1937, an accidental fire aboard the ship caused an internal explosion that destroyed the ship. Some of her guns were salvaged and mounted in coastal batteries after the war and remain extant, though no longer in use. Design Line-drawing of the Espa√±a class Following the destruction of much of the Spanish fleet in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898, the Spanish Navy made a series of failed attempts to begin the process of rebuilding. After the First Moroccan Crisis strengthened Spain's ties to Britain and France and public support for rearmament increased in its aftermath, the Spanish government came to an agreement with those countries for a plan of mutual defense. In exchange for British and French support for Spain's defense, the Spanish fleet would support the French Navy in the event of war with the Triple Alliance. A strengthened Spanish fleet was thus in the interests of Britain and France, which accordingly provided technical assistance in the development of modern warships, the contracts for which were awarded to the firm Spanish Sociedad Espa√±ola de Construcci√≥n Naval (SECN), which was formed by the British shipbuilders Vickers, Armstrong Whitworth, and John Brown & Company. The vessels were authorized some six months after the British had completed the \\"all-big-gun\\" , and after discarding plans to build pre-dreadnought-type battleships, the naval command quickly decided to build their own dreadnoughts. Jaime I was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of ; her freeboard was amidships. The ship displaced as designed and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of four-shaft Parsons steam turbines driving four screw propellers, with steam provided by twelve Yarrow boilers. The engines were rated at and produced a top speed of . Jaime I had a cruising radius of at a speed of . Her crew consisted of 854 officers and enlisted men. Jaime I was armed with a main battery of eight 50-caliber guns, mounted in four twin gun turrets. One turret was placed forward, two were positioned en echelon amidships, and the fourth was aft of the superstructure. This mounting scheme was chosen in preference to superfiring turrets, as was done in the American s, to save weight and cost. For defense against torpedo boats, she carried a secondary battery that consisted of twenty guns mounted individually in casemates along the length of the hull. They were too close to the waterline, however, which made them unusable in heavy seas. She was also armed with four 3-pounder guns and two machine guns. Her armored belt was thick amidships; the main battery turrets were protected with the same amount of armor plate. The conning tower had thick sides. Her armored deck was thick. Service history Construction and the Rif War Illustration of an Espa√±a-class battleship by Oscar Parkes Jaime I, named for the 13th century James I of Aragon, was laid down at the SECN shipyard in Ferrol on 5 February 1912. She was launched on 21 September 1914, less than two months after the start of World War I. Spain remained neutral during the conflict, but because Britain supplied much of the armament and other building materials, work on Jaime I was considerably delayed. She was largely complete by early 1915, by which time she only lacked her main battery guns and mounts, which could not be delivered owing to the war. She underwent initial machinery testing in May 1915, and the ship was ready to go to sea by 1917, but she was not completed until well after the end of the war. She conducted sea trials in May 1921, slightly exceeding on speed tests, and work was finally finished on 20 December. Upon her completion, she joined her two sister ships in the 1st Squadron of the Spanish fleet. Throughout the early 1920s, she provided fire support to the Spanish Army in its campaigns in Morocco during the Rif War that had broken out in mid-1921. Her sister ship was wrecked during operations off Morocco in 1923. During this period, tensions over the European colonial holdings in North Africa‚Äîpredominantly stoked by Italy's fascist leader Benito Mussolini over the perceived lack of prizes for Italy's eventual participation in World War I on the side of Britain and France‚Äîhad led to a rapprochement between Italy and Spain in 1923, which was at that time ruled by the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera. Primo de Rivera sent a fleet consisting of Jaime I, her sister , the light cruiser , two destroyers, and four submarines to visit the Italian fleet in late 1923. They departed Valencia on 16 November and stopped in La Spezia and Naples, arriving back in Barcelona on 30 November. Jaime I underway and firing her secondary battery, c. 1932 Rif insurgents operating a coastal artillery battery damaged Jaime I in 1924. By 1925, the Rif rebels had widened the war by attacking French positions in neighboring French Morocco. Spain and France planned a major landing at Alhucemas, consisting of some 13,000 soldiers, 11 tanks, and 160 aircraft, to attack the core rebel territory in September. The Spanish Navy supplied Jaime I, Alfonso XIII, four cruisers, a seaplane tender, and several smaller craft. The French added the battleship , two cruisers, and several other vessels. Both fleets provided gunfire support as the ground forces landed on 8 September; the amphibious assault was a success, and after heavy fighting over the next two years, the Rifian rebels were defeated. In the final days of the conflict in October 1927, Alfonso XIII, his wife, and a number of generals, including Primo de Rivera, Francisco Franco, D√°maso Berenguer, and Ricardo Burguete, traveled to Morocco to tour the pacified colony. They came aboard Jaime I at Algeciras, Spain and crossed to Ceuta in Morocco on 5 October. After completing their tour, they returned to the ship on 10 October to be taken back to Spain. Early 1930s By the early 1930s, the effects of the Great Depression had spurred significant domestic opposition to the regime of Primo de Rivera, leading to his resignation on 28 January, and ultimately to Alfonso XIII's exile in April 1931. Immediately thereafter, the government of the Second Spanish Republic began a series of cost-cutting measures to offset the deficits that had been incurred during the Rif War, and as a result, both Espa√±a and Jaime I were placed in reserve in Ferrol on 15 June. Jaime I was recommissioned on 20 April 1933 to serve as the fleet flagship. Plans to modernize the Espa√±a-class battleships traced their origin to the 1920s, but the increased risk of conflict with Italy by the mid-1930s put increased pressure to begin the work. One proposal, advanced in 1934, advocated rebuilding the ships into analogues to the German s with new oil-fired boilers. The ships' hulls would have been lengthened, and the main battery turrets rearranged so they would all be on the centerline. The ships' secondary batteries would have been replaced with dual-purpose (DP) guns. The plan ultimately came to nothing. The finalized plan for Jaime I and Espa√±a involved increasing the height of the wing turrets' barbettes, improving their fields of fire and allowing them to fire over the new secondary battery, which was to consist of twelve 120 mm DP guns placed on the upper deck in open mounts. A new anti-aircraft battery of either ten or eight guns were to be fitted. Other changes were to be made to improve fire-control systems, increase crew accommodation spaces, and install anti-torpedo bulges, among other improvements. Work on both vessels was slated to begin in early 1937, but the scheduled modernization was interrupted by the Spanish coup of July 1936, which plunged the country into the Spanish Civil War. Spanish Civil War Illustration of Jaime I as she appeared in 1937 In mid-July 1936, Jaime I was moored in Vigo; she was at that time the only battleship capable of going to sea, as her sister Espa√±a was being repaired in Ferrol. Franco, the leader of the Nationalist coup against the government, relied on defections from the Navy to carry the Army of Africa to Spain. The ships' crews in Ferrol already knew about the plans by 13 July, and many attended a meeting that day to discuss what course of action they would take if the officer corps joined Franco when he launched the coup. On the morning of 18 July, wireless operators in the navy headquarters Madrid intercepted radio messages from Franco to rebels in Morocco; they alerted naval headquarters, which in turn sent messages to every ship in the fleet to alert the crews to watch for rebellious officers. The crews in Cartagena, including Jaime I, mutinied after their commanders began to join the Nationalists, murdering many of them and ensuring the ships would remain under government control in the Spanish Republican Navy. Jaime I avoided the worst of the bloodshed, as her commander opted to remain loyal to the government. Jaime I got underway on 19 July to attempt to block the crossing, joining other elements of the fleet off Gibraltar later that day. Despite the fact that the Republican government had retained most of the fleet in the Mediterranean, it was unable to block the passage of the Army of Africa to Spain. The vessels were crippled by poor discipline for some time, as they had had few remaining officers and the crews distrusted those that were not killed. In addition, the German Kriegsmarine (War Navy) had sent the heavy cruisers and to protect the convoys of transport ships that carried heavy weapons. And significant numbers of soldiers were carried by Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft covertly supplied by the Nazis through the dummy corporation Sociedad Hispano-Marroqu√≠ de Transportes (Spanish-Moroccan Transport Company). In the first months of the war, Jaime I shelled a number of rebel strongholds, among them Ceuta, Melilla, and Algeciras. In Algeciras, she scored hits with her secondary armament on the Nationalist gunboat , which was burned down to the waterline, although she was later repaired and returned to service. On 13 August, Jaime I was damaged by a Nationalist air attack at M√°laga; a pair of bombers from the German Condor Legion attacked the vessel early that morning. They scored a hit with a small bomb that struck the ship in the bow and caused minimal damage. coastal battery near Tarifa The elements of the Spanish fleet that had been moored in Ferrol were seized by Nationalist forces at the start of the revolt; these ships included Espa√±a, which was used to enforce a blockade of the northern Spanish ports of Gij√≥n, Santander, and others. In response to these operations, the Republicans deployed a flotilla of five submarines from the Mediterranean, though one was sunk by Nationalist forces en route. They also briefly deployed Jaime I, a pair of light cruisers, and six destroyers to Gij√≥n, arriving on 25 September, but the squadron departed already on 13 October without having attacked Espa√±a or any other elements of the Nationalist fleet. For their part, the Nationalists avoided confronting the Republican ships, owing in large part to the significantly better condition of Jaime I compared to Espa√±a, the latter having only three of her four turrets in operation. When the Republican ships departed, they left behind two of the submarines and one of the destroyers, and some of Jaime Is secondary guns were dismounted, later to be installed on four fishing boats. In early 1937, Jaime I was dry docked in Cartagena for repairs after a recent grounding. A group of five Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers of the Italian Aviazione Legionaria attacked on 21 May after she had been re-floated. Republican anti-aircraft fire was ineffective and failed to prevent the bombers from making two runs on the ship, dropping around sixty bombs in total. Reports of their success vary; the military historian Albert Nofi states that they scored three hits that caused only minor damage, while the historian Marco Mattioli states that the attack resulted in two hits, two near misses on her starboard side and three more on the quay to which she was moored, disabling the ship. On 17 June, while at Cartagena, she was destroyed by an accidental internal explosion and fire, although sabotage was suspected. Some 200 men were killed in the explosion. She was refloated, but determined to be beyond repair. She was officially discarded on 3 July 1939 and was subsequently broken up for scrap. All the guns were recovered from the wreck and were erected in coastal artillery batteries in 1940 near Tarifa to cover the Strait of Gibraltar. Four of her guns, from the fore and aft turrets, were mounted two apiece at the Vigia Battery (D-9) and the Cascabel Battery (D-10). Each battery consisted of a concrete emplacement that included a magazine and a separate command post. Both batteries were abandoned in 1985 but are still present, albeit in a state of degradation owing to a lack of maintenance.

Characters *Eizan Kaburagi (voiced by Nathan Kress) is a 10-year-old ninja student of shuriken. Eizan is intelligent, hardworking, and eager to learn. His dream since childhood is to become a ninja. It is hinted that he has a crush on Okuni and also has a rivalry with Naginata. His weapon is a green plastic ruler. He is also clumsy as shown in the episode \\"Phantom of the Kabuki\\". *Okuni Dohan (voiced by Jessica DiCicco) is a 10-year-old ninja student of Shuriken and the only female member of the main group, also the most well-studied of them. She frequently cites examples from important lessons, and possesses great deductive skills and origami talent, and her weapon is a jump rope. She also has quite a short fuse, and has a crush on Eizan. There is a rivalry between Okuni and the Kimura Twins from Katana. *Jimmy B. (voiced by Kimberly Brooks) is an 11-year-old ninja student of Shuriken Jimmy comes from a comfortable New York family, but spent his time with his rap gang, developing a real talent for break-dancing. His parents sent him to Tokirohama to stay with his aunt and uncle. Before coming to Shuriken, he went to Katana school, Shuriken's rivaling school but was expelled after a week. His weapon is a skateboard. *Nobunaga (voiced by Brooks): He comes from a long line of skilled sumo wrestlers, and dresses accordingly. He is fairly well respected among his peers, and his size and strength make him a formidable opponent. He appears as a fat boy with a large belly spilling over his mawashi. His girth makes him slow, but he trained to be agile enough to keep up with his peers. He was named after the Sengoku warlord, Oda Nobunaga. *Tetsuo Matsura (voiced by Charlie Adler): A bitter second-year student who looks down on all freshmen with disdain. He is a powerful and skilled ninja, but his anger keeps him from advancing further. This, combined with his great height, may mean that he has been held back for an unspecified amount of time. Constantly following him is his mindless lackey, Yota. He is named after Tetsuo Shima from Akira. *Yota Sugimura (voiced by DiCicco): Tetsuo's very short and ever-present lackey, following him about like a remora follows a shark. He has little personality of his own, often inheriting the personality of the person he is with. He is extremely clumsy, but (somewhat paradoxically) is good at sneaking. *Ami Saeki (voiced by DiCicco): A blonde girl who wears a sailor fuku-type uniform. She is very vain, constantly obsessing over her appearance. However, her pampered looks conceal a great aptitude for disguise and deception. She has a crush on Jimmy B. which is implied in the episode, \\"Flip Flops of Fury\\". Daisuke seems to like her quite a lot; however, she does not return the feeling (though she did kiss him once in \\"Phantom of the Kabuki\\"). She was initially one of the students selected to go to the cheerleading school but she gave her ticket to Okuni. She bears a resemblance to Minako Aino and her first name is from Ami Mizuno, both from the Sailor Moon franchise. *Marcos Gonzalez (voiced by Kress): A Latin-American student who came to Shuriken School to hide from a vicious group called the 3-Saints Gang from Mexico. It turned out that he ran to Shuriken because he saw them with their masks off. Thinking they were after him, he hid in Shuriken. It was proven in the episode \\"An XXL Lie\\" that they abandoned their masks to become Midwestern singers, making his whole escape pointless. He is very sly and mysterious, and he wears sunglasses in order to hide his face. He excels in covert strikes, and possesses all-around good skills in other fields as well. *Jacques Morimura (voiced by Kress): A rather confused young French man who believes Shuriken School is a diving school, due to the similarities between the uniforms. He dresses in a black scuba suit, reminiscent of Jacques Cousteau, whom he is named after. His specialty is underwater combat. *Choki (voiced by Kress): A Tibetan monk who possesses the powers of telepathy and psychokinesis. He spends most of his time asleep or meditating, and has a very easy-going personality. Most of the time, he prefers floating over walking. *Daisuke Togakame (voiced by Maurice LaMarche): An arrogant student who cares more about his hair than his studies, Daisuke is a known coward, and is quick to run from a fight. However, he is not completely useless; his nimble fingers make him a very good tailor. He likes a fellow student named Amy, constantly hitting on her and trying to randomly kiss her in almost every episode he appears in. In the episode \\"An XXL Lie\\" it is shown that he genuinely likes Amy. In the episode \\"Eizan's Shadow\\", Daisuke is seen not washing his hands after using the bathroom, suggesting poor hygiene habits. *Pork: Pork is, perhaps, the most mysterious of all the Shuriken School students. He appears to be an anthropomorphic pig, and is apparently mute (except for a small grunt in \\"An XXL Lie\\"). He communicates via musical instruments, which he is proficient in using. He is also very good at detecting the purpose and personality of disguised and supernatural enemies such as in the episodes \\"Funny Chick\\" and \\"The Demon and Mrs. Clean\\" respectively, where he detects that the Chick has foul purposes and tries to get the group to stop it, and that the demon messing up the place is really a possessed Mrs. Clean; thus he is not afraid of it unlike the others, but rather enjoys the actions of the former. These actions imply that in place of speech, he has been granted clairvoyance. He is shown to have mind control powers in one episode. He seems to have an interest in art. *Principal of Shuriken (voiced by Adler): Also called \\"Principal-sama\\", the principal is always worried about the school's funding and is also money-obsessed to the point that in the episode \\"Eizan's Shadow\\", he actually asked Kazumi's parents to put the withdrawn check on the phone so he could talk to it. However, he does have exceedingly good ninjitsu skills that made him the principal. He usually has a positive thinking in many situation. He has an allergy to animals. *Vladimir Keitawa (voiced by Adler): One of the three teachers at Shuriken School. He has a really long middle name. He comes from Russia, has great physical strength and has a weakness for attractive women. Vlad once pretended to be a foreign exchange student named \\"Ed\\" in the episode \\"Vlad's Past\\", as it is revealed that although he teaches at Shuriken School, he is not a certified teacher because--due to his extreme phobia of tests--he did not pass the stealth and evasion course. Eizan and the gang disguise him as an exchange student and help him hide from the inspector, who is after Vlad to expose him. After conquering his fear and fooling Kubo and the inspector, it is proven that he has passed the course, making him a certified Ninja Teacher. *Kubo Utamaro (voiced by LaMarche): One of the three teachers at Shuriken School. Kubo teaches boring theory lessons and has a crush on Kita. He also dreams of being principal one day. *Kita Shunai (voiced by DiCicco): One of the three teachers at Shuriken School. She has master skills with ninja weapons and she used to be a teacher at Katana School. She has a pretty bad temper. She is also the only female teacher of Shuriken School. *Zumichito (voiced by LaMarche): Shuriken School's groundskeeper. He used to be a student there; thus he knows all of the secrets of the school, and knows a lot of stories about it as well. *Mrs. Clean (voiced by Adler): Real name Michiyo, Mrs. Clean is the Shuriken School's cleaning lady. She has spent her whole life around Shuriken School and knows some ninja moves as well. She takes great pride in her work, and if her cleaning is disrupted, she transforms into a terrifying demon. Katana School *Naginata (voiced by LaMarche): An 11-year-old student of Shuriken's rivaling school, Katana. He is selfish, evil, and a twisted loner, who masters the art of trickery like no other, only using his ninjutsu for the cause of others' misfortune. He and his group sucks up to Katana's principal and usually cheats in battles where he's losing. He is also the only one of his gang that is not afraid of the principal. He has an intense rivalry with Eizan, having lost against him in the episode, \\"The Winning Ninja\\". *Bruce Chang (voiced by Brooks): A 10-year-old ninja student of katana and is One of Naginata's loyal followers, Bruce likes getting into fights . He has a bad temper and also a loud mouth, which coincidentally, gets the group into trouble. He has a rivalry with Jimmy B. He is a brave fighter but is very reckless, usually jumping into a battle without a 2nd thought. He sleeps with a teddy bear. *The Kimura Twins (voiced by DiCicco): 10-year-old ninja students of katana and are followers of Naginata, they are sneaky and will usually gather information for Naginata. They act tough when they are together but when apart, they weaken. They are also dependent on each other. They are sexists as well, which makes them hate Okuni the most. *Doku: Another one of Naginata's followers, Doku is big and easily outwitted. His mother still brings him lunch everyday. *Principal of Katana (voiced by Adler): Everyone seems to fear this man. He owns a cute ninja chick that he always keeps by his side named Chirpy Chick, and his face is always covered by an ominous shadow. Naginata and his group suck up to him to earn his favor, and he clearly despises Shuriken and its students. His hairstyle is similar to that of Heihachi Mishima from the Tekken fighting games.

Professor Barry Naughton coined the term in his book, ‚ÄúThe China Circle.‚Äù During the 1960s and 1970s, Hong Kong and Taiwan specialized in labor-intensive manufactured exports that mainly went to the United States market. By the mid-1980s, however, rising land and labor costs, coupled with current realignments, created pressures for manufacturers to move to lower- cost locations. Additionally, national capabilities moved up as scientific education increased and commercial and financial experience accumulated. This created a ‚Äúpull‚Äù for Hong Kong and Taiwan to move to high-skilled sectors.Naughton, Barry. 2007. The Chinese Economy; Transitions and Growth. Cambridge: MIT Press. pp. 416-18. At the same time, China was opening up for foreign investment, and modeled parts of its economic reform after the successes of Taiwan and Hong Kong. This created an opportunity for Taiwan and Hong Kong firms to move their labor-intensive operations to their lower-cost neighbor, China. In the end, this created a regional production chain whereby Hong Kong and Taiwan specialized in high-value services and technology- intensive production and while the PRC took on the more labor-intensive manufacturing. This economic network is now known as ‚ÄúThe China Circle.‚Äù Naughton attributes this move to three main factors. First, there was a global trend in increased intra-industry trade. Second, labor and land costs in China were low and access was made relatively open. Third, the common language and customs made cultural entry costs cheap.Naughton, Barry. 1997.

Life A farmer from Notown, a village on the outskirts of Leominster, Massachusetts, Palmer was a veteran of the War of 1812. In 1830, Palmer was a successful Yankee farmer, but was by no means a typical one. Possibly influenced in childhood by a bearded itinerant evangelist named Lorenzo Dow, Palmer took to wearing a long beard in the 1820s. Few men in the United States wore beards after about 1720, and Palmer was considered eccentric and slovenly. Nicknamed \\"the old Jew\\", he was regularly harassed and questioned about his insistence on wearing a beard. A prominent Fitchburg minister once accosted him: \\"Palmer, why don't you shave and not go around looking like the devil?\\" Palmer replied: \\"Mr. Trask, are you not mistaken in your comparison of personages? I have never seen a picture of the ruler of the sulfurous regions with much of a beard, but if I remember correctly, Jesus wore a beard not unlike mine.\\" One day early in May 1830, four men armed with scissors and razors attacked Palmer outside a Fitchburg hotel and attempted to shave him. Palmer successfully fended off his attackers. He was even able to use his jackknife to wound the legs of two of his assailants. Charged with \\"unprovoked assault\\", Palmer was arraigned a few days later before Judge David Brigham and fined. Palmer refused to pay the $10 fine, nearly $40 in court fees, and a $700 bond that resulted from his conviction for the crime of defending himself. Palmer was thrown into the Worcester County Jail and kept there for more than a year for refusing to pay the fine. Palmer kept a detailed journal of his fifteen months in the jail; the original is preserved in the archive at Fruitlands Museum. His prison diary records the words and actions of his often sadistic jailers, the experiences of his fellow prisoners, and his own steadfastness in resisting the efforts of the state and society to break him of his unconventional habits and opinions. Palmer's term in jail was extremely unpleasant at times. He was dangerously sick during his first few weeks behind bars. Later, he was beaten several times by the jailers, nearly starved for days at a time, placed in solitary confinement for several months, and physically threatened by other prisoners who tried to cut off his beard. But Palmer made life nearly as difficult for the officials who were keeping him in the jail as they made it for him. To Calvin Willard, Sheriff of Worcester County, he sent a constant stream of letters, complaining of the poor conditions in the jail. One time, to prove to the sheriff how little food he was receiving, he sent Willard a package containing every morsel of food the jailers had given him in one day. For such acts, his jail keepers, especially Hosea Bellows and Dorance Wilder, treated Palmer even worse. On September 22, 1830, after a little more than four months in prison, Palmer exploded in distress and fury at the treatment he and his fellow prisoners were receiving. He was punished for his outburst by spending the next three months in solitary confinement. Throughout his imprisonment, Palmer insisted that he was innocent and that to pay a fine, even only $10, would equate to admitting his own guilt. Palmer's case became something of an embarrassment to county authorities, who realized that his jail term was far exceeding his \\"crime\\", and they sent several committees to the jail to convince him to leave. They offered to waive the $700 bond, if he would only pay the fine and court fees. Palmer told one of the committees, \\"If I aint [sic] a safe person to have my liberty I ought not to go out. And I am willing to stay in confinement til [sic] I am.\\" It was not until David Brigham, the judge who had originally fined Palmer, visited the Worcester prison and begged Palmer to relent. Brigham also carried a letter from Palmer's mother, a woman well into her eighties, pleading with him to come home. On August 31, 1831, after more than fifteen months in prison, Palmer paid his fine and left the jail. Palmer publicized his case by writing letters from jail that were widely published after first appearing in the Worcester Spy. When he later visited Boston in 1840, crowds on the street mocked him. Imprisonment reinforced Palmer's interest in political and religious reform. He was involved in prison reform and was an early abolitionist. In the early-1840s he attended the Chardon Street Convention in Boston, which is where Palmer met such prominent figures as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Amos Bronson Alcott, and William Lloyd Garrison. His acquaintance with Alcott led to his decision to join the Fruitlands experiment in 1843. Palmer joined the short-lived Fruitlands commune in Harvard, Massachusetts, where he proved one of the more practical farmers.John Matteson, Eden's Outcasts: The Story of Louisa May Alcott and fer Father, (NY: W.W. Norton, 2007), 121, 125, 148, 164 He bought the group's property when it dissolved as a social experiment. Emerson and Henry David Thoreau visited him there. Palmer briefly tried to establish a second communal enterprise, founding the Leominster and Harvard Benevolent Association with Charles Lane.J. E. M. Latham, Search for a New Eden: James Pierrepont Greaves (1777-1842): The Sacred Socialist and his Followers (Associated University Presses, 1999), 219, available online, accessed June 10, 2011 He appears as the character Moses White in Louisa May Alcott's Transcendental Wild Oats. He supported the abolition of slavery. Palmer died in 1873, by which time beards had become widely fashionable again. He is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in North Leominster and his grave marker bears a bearded portrait of him with the inscription \\"Persecuted for Wearing the Beard\\". Harvard Law School's Zechariah Chafee cited Palmer's case in his classic Freedom of Speech (1920). In the context of World War I restrictions on free speech, he called Palmer's case the reductio ad abusurdum that refuted attempts to justify the imprisonment of those whose words or behavior arouse violent reactions in others.Zechariah Chafee, Freedom of Speech (Rahway, NJ: Quinn Boden, 1920), 172  References  Category:1791 births Category:1874 deaths Category:American military personnel of the War of 1812 Category:People from Harvard, Massachusetts ","title":"Joseph Palmer (communard)"},{"id":"17649206","text":"The Thomas T. Gaff House is the diplomatic residence of the Colombian ambassador to the United States, a post currently held by Francisco Santos Calder√≥n. The house, a contributing property to the Dupont Circle Historic District, is located at 1520 20th Street NW, Washington, D.C., across from the north entrance to the metro station in Dupont Circle and one block from Massachusetts Avenue's Embassy Row. Its architecture was inspired by the Ch√¢teau Balleroy in Normandy, France, and features a hidden ballroom and a mix of 18th- and 19th-century interior designs. The house has been home to a wealthy industrialist from Ohio, a United States Senator, a member of the United States President's Cabinet, a Greek ambassador, and a former President of Colombia. History Thomas T. Gaff was a wealthy businessman who made his fortune in the distillery and heavy machinery business in Cincinnati, Ohio. His childhood home, Hillforest, in Aurora, Indiana is a National Historic Landmark. After Gaff was appointed as a commissioner to the Panama Canal's construction by then-United States Secretary of War William Howard Taft, he and his wife Zaidee moved to Washington, D.C. The Gaffs chose New York City architect Bruce Price, working with the local architect and builder Jules Henri de Sibour to design their home at the corner of 20th and Q Streets NW. Jules Henri de Sibour was a prominent architect of large homes in Washington, D.C., including the Clarence Moore House, Andrew Mellon Building, and the ambassador residences of Portugal, France, and Luxembourg. Construction of the house lasted from 1904 to 1905. The Gaff House was well known in Washington, D.C.'s high society; tea parties and other events were mentioned in The New York Times. From 1924 to 1925, the house was leased to Peter Goelet Gerry, a Senator from Rhode Island. After Gerry moved to a new home, the Gaff house was leased to Dwight F. Davis, President Calvin Coolidge's Secretary of War and founder of the Davis Cup. The government of Greece leased the house in 1929 for use as an embassy. In 1944, the Gaff house was sold to Colombia by Carey D. Langhorne, Thomas T. Gaff's daughter. The house has since been used as the official residence (the embassy) of the Colombian ambassador to the United States. The offices (the chancery) of the Embassy of Colombia to the United States are located a few blocks east of the Gaff House on Embassy Row. Notable ambassadors who have resided in the Gaff house include former President of Colombia, Andr√©s Pastrana. The 2009 property value of the Gaff House is $8,061,440. Architecture Drawing designs by de Sibour of the Thomas T. Gaff House The exterior architecture of the Thomas T. Gaff House is an example of a 17th-century Ch√¢teauesque manor, but only two rooms in the house follow French style. Gaff instructed the designers to include novel conveniences such as a hot-air system to dry clothes, a trapdoor to his icehouse so that deliveries could be made directly from the street, and cork insulation for his wine cellar. The interior features a mixture of 17th- and 18th-century designs. The main hall and dining room are lined with wooden paneling, Elizabethan wainscoting, and a sideboard that was originally used in an Italian monastery. The reception hall, which at one time doubled as a living room, contains a wooden stair rail with baroque scrollwork and walls that are covered with Louis XIII-style oak panelling. The drawing room resembles 18th- century interior design with lighter wood used for panelling and basic geometric lines. In the sitting room, a hidden, movable wooden wall reveals the two-story Edwardian ballroom, which features a multivaulted wooden ceiling and ornamental plasterwork. The wood that covers the ceiling was discovered during a repair operation. A dome with a stained-glass cupola is located above the center of the ballroom. This room is used for charity balls, formal dinners, and as a gallery and concert hall. There were originally 220 drawings of the house's design by de Sibour, but only 20 survive.

Beto, 405 U.S. 319 (1972), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court upheld a Free Exercise claim on the basis of the allegations that the state of Texas had discriminated against a Buddhist prisoner by \\"denying him a reasonable opportunity to pursue his Buddhist faith comparable to that offered other prisoners adhering to conventional religious precepts.\\" Background Fred Arispe Cruz, a Mexican-American born in San Antonio, Texas in 1939, was often in trouble with the police in his teenage years, and became addicted to heroin. In 1960, at 21, Cruz was arrested and convicted of ‚Äúrobbery by assault‚Äù. He was sentenced to 50 years in a state prison in 1961. Cruz denied taking part in the robberies. Wanting to appeal his conviction but unable to afford a lawyer, Cruz began to read all of the law books that he could find in the prison library. Despite only having an 8th grade education, Cruz filed his first pro se appeal to the robbery charge in 1962. Fed up with the harsh field labor, brutal corporal punishments and arbitrary disciplinary hearings experienced by prisoners Cruz uses his new-found knowledge to write a lawsuit against the prison system. Because of his ‚Äúlegal activities‚Äù Cruz was classified as an agitator and transferred to the ‚ÄúEllis Unit‚Äù (Also known as the ‚ÄúAlcatraz of Texas‚Äù) in 1963. At the Ellis Unit Cruz was pushed to drop his lawsuit by enduring many hours of solitary confinement. In 1967 Cruz wrote to Reverend Hogen Fujimoto, minister in the Shin Buddhist Churches of America (BCA) to request information on Buddhism. Cruz shared the information he received with other inmates which landed him back in solitary, which at the time meant a bread and water diet with a small meal served every third day. Despite the abusive conditions Cruz succeeded in filing his own lawsuit as well as those of other inmates. One of the suits Cruz assisted with is that of a Muslim at the facility who argued that his civil rights were being violated. Warden McAdams punished two inmates for the incident and kept Muslim prisoners at work in the fields six days a week instead of the five days assigned to other inmates. Within days a riot broke out in the Muslim cell block. This 1968 riot was the first at Ellis Unit and helped build solidarity among prisoners and gain the attention of outsiders. One of these outsiders was Frances Jalet (later Frances Jalet-Cruz, as Cruz and Jalet were married after his prison release), an attorney whom Cruz had contacted in 1967 after reading about her in a newspaper. Jalet, along with attorney William Bennett Turner, would assist Cruz in his watershed case, Cruz v. Beto. Case Cruz, a Buddhist, complained that he was not allowed to use the prison chapel, that he was prohibited from writing to his religious advisor, and that he was placed in solitary confinement for sharing his religious material with other prisoners. Cruz filed the lawsuit using his own toilet paper ration. The Federal District Court initially denied relief without a hearing or findings, holding the complaint to be in an area that should be left \\"to the sound discretion of prison administration.\\" An amended complaint argued that: : \\"While prisoners who are members of other religious sects are allowed to use the prison chapel, Cruz is not. He shared his Buddhist religious material with other prisoners and, according to the allegations, in retaliation was placed in solitary confinement on a diet of bread and water for two weeks, without access to newspapers, magazines, or other sources of news. He also alleged that he was prohibited from corresponding with his religious advisor in the Buddhist sect.\\" and contrasted that with the fact that the prison: :\\"...encourages inmates to participate in other religious programs, providing at state expense chaplains of the Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant faiths; providing also at state expense copies of the Jewish and Christian Bibles, and conducting weekly Sunday school classes and religious services. According to the allegations, points of good merit are given prisoners as a reward for attending orthodox religious services, those points enhancing a prisoner's eligibility for desirable job assignments and early parole consideration\\" so: :\\"...plaintiff and the members of the class he represents are being subjected to an arbitrary and unreasonable exclusion without any lawful justification which invidiously discriminates against them in violation of their constitutional right of religious freedom and denies them equal protection of the laws.\\" Outcome The court found that: :\\"Texas has discriminated against petitioner by denying him a reasonable opportunity to pursue his Buddhist faith comparable to that offered other prisoners adhering to conventional religious precepts...\\". Concurrence Mr. Chief Justice Burger concurred in the result: \\"I concur in the result reached even though the allegations of the complaint are on the borderline necessary to compel an evidentiary hearing. Some of the claims alleged are frivolous; others do not present justiciable issues. There cannot possibly be any constitutional or legal requirement that the government provide materials for every religion and sect practiced in this diverse country. At most, Buddhist materials cannot be denied to prisoners if someone offers to supply them\\". Dissenting Opinion Mr. Justice Rehnquist offered dissenting view of the decision. That dissent is summarized below: > Unlike the Court, I am not persuaded that petitioner's complaint states a > claim under the First Amendment, or that if the opinion of the Court of > Appeals is vacated the trial court must necessarily conduct a trial upon the > complaint. > Petitioner alleges that voluntary services are made available at prison > facilities so that Protestants, Catholics, and Jews may attend church > services of their choice.

It is the second game in Nintendo's Rhythm Heaven series and the first one released worldwide, following the Japan-only Game Boy Advance title Rhythm Tengoku, and was succeeded by Rhythm Heaven Fever for the Wii and Rhythm Heaven Megamix for the 3DS. The game was released in Japan on July 31, 2008, in North America on April 5, 2009, in Europe on May 1, 2009, and in Australia on June 4, 2009. Gameplay Unlike its predecessor which is played using the GBA's buttons, Rhythm Heaven is played using the touch screen with the DS held vertically, similarly to a book. Throughout the game, players use the stylus to play through several rhythm-based levels known as Rhythm Games, each with their own specific rules. Controls used include tapping the touch screen, holding the stylus down on the touch screen, dragging it across the screen and flicking it off the screen. A guitar-based minigame late in the game known as Rockers, along with the unlockable guitar lessons, also include the use of the DS's shoulder buttons to bend guitar notes. The game's fifty Rhythm Games are split into ten sets, each consisting of four Rhythm Games and a themed Remix level that incorporates the previous games (or more) into one song. In each Rhythm Game, the player must attempt to keep with the rhythm throughout the level, receiving a rank at the end of the game depending on how well they did. To clear a Rhythm Game and progress onto the next game, the player needs to get a 'Just OK' or 'OK' rank. By receiving a 'Superb' rank on each Rhythm Game, players receive Medals which unlock bonus content, such as Endless Games, Rhythm Toys and Guitar Lessons. Sometimes, a Rhythm Game that a player has received a Superb rating on may be randomly selected for a Perfect attempt. Only appearing on the menu three times before moving elsewhere, these runs require the player to complete a Rhythm Game perfectly without making any mistakes. Completing these perfect runs earns more bonus features in the cafe, such as song sheets and lyrics. Music Rhythm Heaven uses original music composed by Tsunku and Masami Yone, with vocals by TNX artists including Canary Club, The Possible, and Tsunku himself (credited as Occhamahttp://ameblo.jp/tsunku-blog/entry-10167669542.html). These vocals were re-recorded in English for the Western version by other vocalists (most notably Ayaka Nagate, a former member of the Tsunku-produced Coconuts Musume), as were some of the voice cues. There were plans to include the Japanese songs in the music player section, but they were soon taken out due to space restrictions. Soundtrack albums for the game have been released in Japan, but not in North America. The European version has been fully translated in Spanish, English, French, German, and Italian language, including the vocal songs in the Fan Club, The Dazzles, Frog Hop, Karate Man, and Airboarder Rhythm Games. Development Rhythm Heaven was developed by Nintendo SP&D1; with the assistance of Tsunku, a music record producer, both also worked on the original Rhythm Tengoku. The conception of the game is credited to Nintendo programmer Kazuyoshi Osawa who previously worked on Metroid and WarioWare titles. The game's development \\"wasn't easy\\" for the staff. Osawa didn't like the idea of using buttons, so he considered a control mechanic that involved the Touch Screen. The ability to touch the edge of the Touch Screen was considered, but was determined to be too difficult. The Flick action took the staff a \\"little getting used to\\" as they had to make it feel \\"fair\\" to the player until they realised that if flicking was combined with the music it would give the players a \\"good sense of timing\\". The Flick action took them about \\"two to three months\\" to research and \\"six months\\" to eventually adapt the control into the game. Tsunku really liked the idea of the Flick action regardless of the long time to adapt. At that time, he thought of the idea for Frog Hop, which became one of the first games to be made for Rhythm Heaven. In April 2010, THQ released a game with similar controls to Rhythm Heaven called Beat City. A Rhythm Heaven Wii game, Rhythm Heaven Fever, succeeded this version; Nintendo president Satoru Iwata saw potential in the game in people's living rooms. He replied: \\"When you see others play with the game and notice that he or she misses out on being perfectly in rhythm, it can also be surprisingly fun.\\" Six years later, another Rhythm Heaven game was released for the Nintendo 3DS under the title of Rhythm Heaven Megamix. It features games from the DS installment, as well as rhythm games from Fever and the original Rhythm Tengoku along with brand- new ones such as Pajama Party, Blue Bear, and Tongue Lashing (as well as newer variants of older ones, such as Super Samurai Slice and Karate Man Senior). Reception The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of two eights and two nines, for a total of 34 out of 40. 411Mania gave it a score of nine out of ten and called it \\"a must-own that won‚Äôt disappoint.\\" Wired gave it a similar score of nine stars out of ten and called it \\"the sort of novel, deep, challenging game that people accuse Nintendo of not creating anymore.\\" The Daily Telegraph gave it eight out of ten and said that the touches \\"elevate [the game] from a fun but throwaway music game into an addictive quest for rhythm perfection. It‚Äôs not a music game as wonderfully elaborate as the superb Elite Beat Agents, but its ostensibly simple mechanics give it a sense of purity that a lot of games lack.\\" The A.V. Club gave it a B and called it \\"the cutest drum machine on the market.\\" As of 11 January 2009, Rhythm Heaven had sold 1,568,000 copies in Japan. It was also the sixth best- selling game in Japan in 2008.

Acquisitions In July 2011, Sitecore acquired the development team and the intellectual property of Pectora, a provider of web publishing solutions for deep integration with print-based projects. In November 2013, Sitecore acquired the assets of commerceserver.net from Smith (formerly Ascentium) and took responsibility and ownership for developing, marketing, and selling Commerce Server, a former Microsoft product. In July 2014, Sitecore acquired a majority stake in Komfo, a Danish social media marketing and community engagement application provider and introduced its social media marketing suite, Sitecore Social. In 2015, a portion of Sitecore's operations moved to Marina Plaza in Sausalito, California. In October 2018, Sitecore announced acquisition of Stylelabs, a marketing technologies software vendor, and stated its intent to incorporate Stylelabs' digital asset management, marketing resource management and product information management applications into its Experience Cloud; the acquisition was completed in November 2018.

Biography He was born in Rodalben. His first studies were in theology. He then studied medicine at the Universities of Strasbourg and Heidelberg, and earned his medical doctorate in 1766. He practiced medicine in Bruchsal and elsewhere for a time, and then became physician to the prince-bishop of Speyer. He was appointed professor of physiology and medical policy at the University of G√∂ttingen in 1784, but the next year he went to Italy for his health and joined the faculty of the University of Pavia, where he succeeded Samuel-Auguste Tissot teaching clinical medicine (1785-1795). He was appointed sanitary inspector general of Lombardy, and introduced reforms in medical instruction and practice. The rank of councillor was conferred on him by the king of England, and later by the emperor of Austria, who employed him in 1795 for the regulation of the sanitary service of the army and as director general of the principal hospital of Vienna. In 1804, he went to Vilnius University as professor of clinical medicine, and then for a period of time (1805‚Äì1808), he was personal physician to Czar Alexander I, and also professor at the medical and surgical academy of St. Petersburg. In 1808, he returned to Vienna, where he was professor of medicine at the University of Vienna, as well as director of the Allegemeines Krankenhaus. He died in Vienna. Work Johann Frank was an important figure in the early history of social medicine and public health. For much of his career he worked on the System einer vollst√§ndigen medicinischen Polizey (A Complete System of Medical Policy), which was a comprehensive 9-volume treatise on all aspects of hygiene and public health. This work was first published in 1779, and was continued until 1827, six years after Frank's death. His methodology for public health dealt with subjects such as public sanitation, water supply issues, sexual hygiene, maternal and child welfare, food safety, and prostitution, to name a few. He stressed the importance of keeping accurate statistical records for hospitals. Reportedly, Frank's system of record compilation was used by obstetrician Ignaz Semmelweiss (1818‚Äì1865) to demonstrate the correlation between puerperal sepsis and unsanitary obstetrical practices. As a director of the Narrenturm, he was also responsible for allowing Franz Joseph Gall access to psychiatric patients in the mid-1780s‚Äîa major formative experience for Gall. Frank is credited with being the first physician to describe clinical differences between diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus.  Family  His son Joseph Frank was a noted physician.  Recognition  LSHTM Frieze Frank's name features on the Frieze of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Twenty-three names of public health and tropical medicine pioneers were chosen to feature on the School building in Keppel Street when it was constructed in 1926.

It was released on July 29, 2008. It is Lustbader's third Bourne novel, following The Bourne Betrayal that was published in 2007. Plot introduction In the prologue, four prisoners at High Security Prison Colony 13, in Nizhny Tagil, Russia, attack Borya Maks and try to kill him. Leonid Danilovich Arkadin, member of the Kazanskaya who appears on scene disguised as a guard, neutralizes the attackers prior to leading Borya into a corridor where, quite ironically, Maks meets his demise. Leonid Danilovich is an assassin sanctioned to kill Borya Maks by Pyotr Zilber. As Arkadin returns to Campione d'Italia, Switzerland, Zilber pays him for a job well done. Pyotr then discusses another prospective target by the name of Semion Icoupov. Zilber, unaware that Icoupov is Arkadin's real boss, is subsequently kidnapped by Leonid. He awakens in a room with Semion Icoupov and Leonid Arkadin standing by. The two men begin to extract information out of him but are brought up short when he offs himself with a hidden tab of cyanide. Arkadin's next mission is to Sevastopol to get possession of an important document that is vitally important to the successful execution of a terrorist act on United States soil. Plot summary At the beginning of the book, Bourne is at Georgetown University talking with Moira Trevor. Moira Trevor wants Bourne to be the head of security at their new liquid natural gas terminal in Long Beach, California. Meanwhile, Veronica Hart, a woman determined to get the DCI job, is on her way to the Oval Office to meet with the President of the United States, Luther LaValle (Pentagon intelligence czar), and Army General Richard P. Kendall. Whilst at a restaurant with Moira, Bourne senses somebody watching him. He has Moira surreptitiously call him on his phone, leaves the restaurant and waits for his enemy to appear. That failing, Bourne goes back into the restaurant to join Moira. He gradually realizes that it is Moira who is the one being followed. Luther LaValle, Rob Batt and General Kendall are hatching a conspiracy amongst their little triumvirate to get Veronica Hart sacked. They want her out of her job as soon as possible. When Bourne and Specter meet in a library, Specter tells Bourne of Pyotr Zilber and his death. Zilber, it is revealed, was a former student of Specter's at Georgetown University. Specter reveals to Bourne that he is a terrorist hunter as well as an academic and would like Jason to go after Semion Icoupov. In Europe, Jason's investigation into the Black Legion turns into one of the deadliest and most tangled operations of his double life: the pursuit of the leader of a murderous terrorist group with roots in the darkest days of World War II. During all of this Leonid Arkadin, who is just as talented as, but even more damaged than Bourne, is getting closer by the minute. While Bourne thinks he is getting closer to Arkadin, Arkadin thinks he's getting closer to Bourne. Bourne goes to Moscow using information provided by Professor Specter. He is followed by many people sent in pursuit of him because of intercepted information. Bourne checks into the Metrtopolya Hotel with a girl named Gala. His arrival is expected by many. The taxi driver, Yakov, is paid by a man named Harris Low to drop him off at the hotel. Yakov is a poor man with an unpleasant past who does what he must to survive. Meanwhile, in the hotel, Bourne wrestles with and garottes a phony waiter (agent Anthony Prowess) after dodging his blade. As he exits the room he finds a blood trail that leads to the closet where Prowess had executed a man also sent to trail Bourne. Meanwhile, Soraya and Tyrone are meeting with Luther LaValle and General Kendall. Tyrone and Soraya are to meet with them because LaValle and Kendall believe they are getting intel on the Black Legion. Tyrone wanders off to finish what he, Soraya and a woman named Kiki are there for. He gets caught and is thrown into a cell. LaValle and Kendall leave Tyrone's life up to Soraya. She must trade Hart for Tyrone. But what LaValle did not know was that Hart was gathering intel that Rob Batt has been gathering ever since he was fired for being a mole. In Moscow, Bourne meets with Dimitri Maslow, who vaguely tells him about Arkadin's life. After the meeting Bourne calls Specter. Specter reveals that Pyotr Zilber was his son and a member of the Black Legion. Bourne knows what Arkadin is capable of doing and is going to go after Specter's last man, Kirsch. Later on when Bourne is in a museum in Munich he leaves Kirsch behind a statue. When he returns he finds him lying there with a bullet through his head. He meets Jens, one of the men Specter sent to give his apartment to Bourne. The pair leaves the building and Semion Icoupov rides up and shoots Jens point blank outside the museum. Escaping the mayhem in the State Museum in Sheremetyevo, Bourne and Petra, a security guard paid to shoot Kirsch, visit Herr Pelz, an older man that Petra knew when she was a child. He helped her in Dachau, where she grew up. \\"Old\\" Pelz tells Bourne more information about the Black Legion. Bourne shows Pelz a picture and asks him if he can identify the people in it. Pointing to the picture of Professor Specter he says \\"Damn, I'd swear this one is Asher Sever.\\" He told Bourne that Sever's dad, Ibrahim, killed Semion Icoupov's father. For that Icupouv executed Ibrahim. The brothers hated each other and wanted the other one killed. After being dropped of at Kirsch's apartment by Petra, Bourne finds a tiny transmitter planted on his passport. The door bells rings and it is Semion Icoupov. A couple of minutes later Arkadin blasts through the window with Devra coming in the back way and armed as well. Icoupov shoots Devra in the chest, but she then manages to shoot him in the shoulder, and he runs out of the house escaping to a rooftop. Arkadin then catches up with Server and Icoupov in their Mercedes and executes them in cold blood with a SIG Sauer Mosquito. Bourne jumps out a helicopter onto the 'Moon of Hormuz' (the tanker), following Arkadin. Bourne and Arkadin team up (or at least Bourne thinks so) to find Sever's man on board with the Black Legion symbol. Once Moira kills the doctor---Sever's man---Bourne comes down in the lower room because the captain told him that she was down there. As he comes up Arkadin lunges at him with a knife aiming at Bourne's stomach. After a long fight, Arkadain goes overboard with a twelve-story drop, plunging into the frigid water below. Back at the hospital where Asher Sever (who we find out is Dominic Specter) is on life support, Bourne meets Willard, the chef at the NSA safe house. There Willard tells him that Arkadin was a member of Treadstone. Conklin knew Icoupov and they agreed it would be good to train Arkadin because he had the drive and nothing to lose. In the end, however, Jason Bourne was the superior asset.

This large amount of time has led to many changes within the nation of Algeria; subsequently, affecting the relations enormously. Through this time period, Algeria has gone through being part of the Ottoman Empire, being conquered and colonized by France, playing an important role in both world wars, and finally being its own nation. Over time, relations between the nations have suffered, as tension between Algerians and the French has increased. Early history An image depicting the Fly Whisk Incident Hayreddin Barbarossa, ruler of Algiers, led an Ottoman embassy to France in 1533. The first contact that was had between the two nations began in 1526, when Algeria was part of the Ottoman Empire. Francis I of France and the Ottoman Emperor Suleiman the Magnificent had just agreed upon the Franco-Ottoman alliance, which initiated contact between France and the Barbary States of Northern Africa. These states were considered vassals for the Ottoman Empire; thus, were drawn into relations with France as a result of this alliance. Algerian-French relations started considerably later, several hundred years after first contact was had between the Ottoman Empire and the French. in short time, the relations between France and Algeria were essentially one of colonization. The colonization of Algeria by France began after a rather peculiar event, in April 1827, when the Dey of Algiers supposedly struck the French consul with a fly whisk.History of Algeria Three years following this event, France began the invasion of Algeria. Between these three years, France unsuccessfully tried a variety of tactics in order to establish control in the region. All of them proved futile leading to a decision in 1830 to invade the country. The Algerians were quick to surrender following the landing of the French army on July 5, 1830. The last dey of Algiers, Husayn, was forced into exile as part of the agreement. However, one important Ottoman Algerian leader held onto power for several more years, but in general was quick to succumb to the French presence in the region. Due to the fact that Constantinople was a considerable distance away from Algiers, France easily stopped Ottoman influence in the region, and instead, asserted their own power. French settling of Algeria French rule of Algeria was established during the years of 1830-47, in which a groundwork was created in how the nation would be controlled. In general, the area was tension-filled, with frequent clashes between the French and the Algerian people. As French occupation continued, French settlers began to colonize the region, and demanded privileges for ruling the land on behalf of the French government. This type of system continued, and Algeria became judicially part of France. Settlers finally secured their power in the region in 1870 after the rise of the Third Republic of France. Before this Algeria was administered through a military administration; however, afterwards, a governor-general to the region was appointed. Although making up only ten percent of the population, the French settlers had many privileges. World War II During World War II, North Africa was the battle ground for much of the European-based war. With the invasion of France by Germany in 1940, the Allied forces were quick to take control of the colonies once controlled by the French. The Anglo-American occupation of North Africa began the start of modern-day Algeria. During this time, the occupational forces (both the Allied and the Axis powers) began delivering messages and promises of a \\"new world for formerly subject[ed] peoples\\". Promises of emancipation excited the Algerian people, as they would finally be able to form a sovereign nation. In December 1942, Ferhat Abbas drafted an Algerian Manifesto, and presented it to both the Allied and French authorities. This manifesto wanted recognition of an Algeria that was sovereign, and free of colonization. As a response, in 1943, French citizenship was given as an option to many North Africans. This, however was not enough to satisfy Algerians and an uprising soon followed. On 8 May 1945, during celebrations to mark the end of the World war, an unorganized rising occurred in Setif where 84 European settlers were killed. The French replied with brute force, suppressing the Algerian population, killing thousands upon thousands of Algerians. Opposition continued against the French, and the brute force used by the French as well continued. In total, estimates of the deaths range from 1,000 to 45,000 deaths, with many more wounded. Following the events of the past as the Setif Massacre, French rule was introduced again. Algerian War For more than a century France maintained colonial rule in Algerian territory. This allowed exceptions to republican law, including Sharia laws applied by Islamic customary courts to Muslim women which gave women certain rights to property and inheritance which they did not have under French law.Benjamin Stora, \\"Avoir 20 ans en Kabylie\\", in L'Histoire n¬∞324, October 2007, Discontent among the Muslim Algerians grew after the World Wars, in which the Algerians sustained many casualties. Algerian nationalists began efforts aimed at furthering equality by listing complaints in the Manifesto of the Algerian People, which requested equal representation under the state and access to citizenship, but no equality for all citizens to preserve Islamic precepts. The French response was to grant citizenship to 60,000 \\"meritorious\\" Muslims. During a reform effort in 1947, the French created a bicameral legislature with one house for the French citizens and another for the Muslims but made a European's vote equal seven times a Muslim's vote. Paramilitary groups such as the Front de Lib√©ration nationale (FLN) appeared, claiming an Arabo-Islamic brotherhood and state. This led to the outbreak of a war for independence, the Algerian War, in 1954. From first armed operations of November 1954, 'Pieds-Noirs' civilians have always been targets for FLN, either by assassination, bombing bars and cinemas and mass massacres, torture and rapes in farms. At the onset of the war, the Pieds- noirs believed the French military would be able to overcome opposition. In May 1958 a demonstration for French Algeria, led by Pieds-Noirs but including many Muslims, occupied an Algerian government building. General Massu controlled the riot by forming a Committee of Public Safety demanding that his acquaintance Charles de Gaulle be named president of the French Fourth Republic, to prevent the \\"abandonment of Algeria\\". This eventually led to the fall of the Republic. In response, the French Parliament voted 329 to 224 to place de Gaulle in power. Once de Gaulle assumed leadership, he attempted peace by visiting Algeria within three days of his appointment claiming \\"French Algeria!\\" but in September 1959 he planned a referendum for Algerian self-determination that passed overwhelmingly. Many French political and military leaders in Algeria viewed this as betrayal and formed the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te (OAS) that had much support among 'Pieds-Noirs'. This paramilitary group began attacking officials representing de Gaulle's authority, Muslims, and de Gaulle himself. The OAS was also accused of murders and bombings nullifying reconciliation opportunities between the communities, while 'Pieds-Noirs' themselves never believed such reconciliation possible as their community was targeted from the start. The opposition culminated in 1961 during the Algiers putsch of 1961, led by retired generals. After this failure, on 18 March 1962, de Gaulle and the FLN signed a cease-fire agreement, the √âvian accords, and held a referendum. In July, Algerians voted 5,975,581 to 16,534 to become independent from France. This was an occasion for a massacre of 'Pieds-Noirs' in Oran by a suburban Muslim population. European people were shot, molested and brought to Petit-Lac slaughterhouse where they were tortured and executed.  Modern times  Despite ambiguous sentiment in Algeria concerning its former colonial power, France has maintained a historically favored position in Algerian foreign relations. Algeria experienced a high level of dependency on France in the first years after the revolution and a conflicting desire to be free of that dependency. The already established trade links, the lack of experienced Algerian government officials, and the military presence provided for in the Evian Accords ending the War of Independence ensured the continuance of French influence. France supplied much-needed financial assistance, a steady supply of essential imports, and technical personnel.Entelis, John P. with Lisa Arone. France and the Mediterranean Countries. Algeria: a country study . Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1993). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. This benevolent relationship was altered in the early Boumedi√®ne years when the Algerian government assumed control of French-owned petroleum extraction and pipeline interests and nationalized industrial and energy enterprises. French military units were almost immediately pulled out. France, although apparently willing to maintain cooperative relations, was overlooked as Algeria, eager to exploit its new independence, looked to other trade partners. Shortly afterward, Algerian interest in resuming French-Algerian relations resurfaced. Talks between Boumedi√®ne and the French government confirmed both countries' interest in restoring diplomatic relations. In 1974, Algeria's President Boumedi√®ne stated \\"Relation between France and Algeria may be good or bad, but in no way can they be trivial.\\", depicting this relationship. France wanted to preserve its privileged position in the strategically and economically important Algerian nation, and Algeria hoped to receive needed technical and financial assistance. French intervention in the Western Sahara against the Polisario and its lack of Algerian oil purchases, leading to a trade imbalance in the late 1970s strained relations and defeated efforts toward bilateral rapprochement. In 1983 Benjedid was the first Algerian leader to be invited to France on an official tour, but relations did not greatly improve. Despite strained political relations, economic ties with France, particularly those related to oil and gas, have persisted throughout independent Algerian history. Nationalized Algerian gas companies, in attempting to equalize natural gas export prices with those of its neighbors, alienated French buyers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, however. Later gas agreements resulted in a vast growth of bilateral trade into the billions of dollars. Further disputes over natural gas pricing in the late 1980s led to a drastic drop in French- Algerian imports and exports. The former fell more than 10 billion French francs, the latter 12 billion French francs between 1985 and 1987. A new price accord in 1989 resurrected cooperative ties. The new agreement provided substantial French financial assistance to correct trade imbalances and guaranteed French purchasing commitments and Algerian oil and gas prices. French support for Benjedid's government throughout the difficult period in 1988 when the government appeared especially precarious and subsequent support for economic and political liberalization in Algeria expedited improved French-Algerian relations. Finally, rapprochement with Morocco, a number of joint economic ventures between France and Algeria, and the establishment of the UMA relaxed some of the remaining tensions. One source of steady agitation has been the issue of Algerian emigration to France. French policies toward Algerian immigrants have been inconsistent, and French popular sentiment has generally been unfavorable toward its Arab population. The French government has vacillated between sweeping commitments to \\"codevelopment,\\" involving extensive social networks for emigrant Algerian laborers, and support of strict regulations concerning work and study permits, random searches for legal papers, and expeditious deportation without appeal in the event of irregularities. North African communities in France remain relatively isolated, and chronic problems persist for Algerians trying to obtain housing, education, and employment. A number of racially motivated incidents occur each year between North African emigrants and French police and citizens. One area that highlights both the dependence of Algeria on France after the revolutionary years, as well as the dynamic of inconsistent French policies towards immigrants, is football. Before the revolution, Algerians players who displayed footballing excellence were called up to the French national team and were able to represent France in major competitions such as the FIFA World Cup. They were not allowed to represent Algeria in the FIFA World Cup since Algeria was not recognized as an independent country at the time. However, following the revolution, Algeria lacked the resources and infrastructure to properly develop young Algerian players and levied this responsibility on France and used France as an incubator of some sort. The upside of this dynamic was that Algerian players were able to gain essential football training and experience. However, the cream of the crop of Algerian players as a result were funneled into the French national team. France was quick to exercise the dual citizenship right of these Algerian players since they were of great value. Several Algerian players, including the legendary Zinedine Zidane, have brought much praise and glory to France and France has always been quick to highlight the French identity of these players as they excelled, while ignoring their Algerian heritage or highlighting it when they make mistakes. The average Algerian players developed in France are then funneled to the Algerian national team, and with such a system, the Algerian soccer team has been systematically handicapped historically. Equally problematic has been Algeria's handling of the emigrant issue. The government has provided substantial educational, economic, and cultural assistance to the emigrant community but has been less consistent in defending emigrant workers' rights in France, frequently subordinating its own workers' interests to strategic diplomatic concerns in maintaining favorable relations with France. The rise of Islamism in Algeria and the subsequent crackdown on the Islamists by the government have had serious implications for both countries: record numbers of Algerian Islamists have fled to France, where their cultural dissimilarity as Arab Islamists is alien to the country. In the early 1990s, nearly 20 percent of all Algerian exports and imports were destined for or originated from France. More than 1 million Algerians resided in France and there were numerous francophones in Algeria, creating a tremendous cultural overlap. French remained the language of instruction in most schools and the language used in more than two-thirds of all newspapers and periodicals and on numerous television programs. Algeria and France share a cultural background that transcends diplomatic manoeuvres and has persisted throughout periods of \\"disenchantment\\" and strained relations. Over time, however, the arabization of Algeria and the increasing polarization of society between the francophone elite and the Arab masses have mobilized anti-French sentiment. Support for the arabization of Algerian society‚Äîincluding the elimination of French as the second national language and emphasis on an arabized education curriculum‚Äîand the recent success of the FIS indicate a growing fervor in Algeria for asserting an independent national identity. Such an identity emphasizes its Arab and Islamic cultural tradition rather than its French colonial past. However, France's support for the military regime that assumed power in early 1992 indicates that the cooperative relations between the two countries remain strong.

The Mo√≥r- Duplex aided in the playing of octaves, tenths, and even chromatic glissandos. The piano makers Steinway, Bechstein, and B√∂sendorfer all put the mechanism into their instruments. Christie performed on the instrument frequently in Europe and the United States and published (in collaboration with Mo√≥r) a manual of technical exercises for the instrument. Recordings Christie also recorded selectively for the Aeolian Vocalion and Winner recording labels. World Premi√®re Performances In concert, Christie premiered Edgar Bainton‚Äôs Concerto-Fantasia and, in New York, on February 23, 1916, the piano version of Charles Tomlinson Griffes' \\"The White Peacock\\" at New York's Punch and Judy Theatre. In 1946, Christie founded and endowed the Westminster Central Music Library in London, England with a gift of ‚Ç§10,000 as a memorial to her late husband. She died, aged 82, in London, England.

Strong Libyan support for the Polisario Front in the Western Sahara until 1984, and similarly hardline positions on colonialism and Israel, facilitated 1970s Algerian relations with Libya. Libyan inclinations for full- scale political union, however, have obstructed formal political collaboration, because Algeria has consistently backed away from such cooperation with its unpredictable neighbour. The Treaty of Oujda (1984) between Libya and Morocco, which represented a response to Treaty of Fraternity and Concord (1983) between Algeria and Tunisia, temporarily aggravated Algeria‚ÄîLibya relations by establishing a political divide in the region‚ÄîLibya and Morocco on one side; and Algeria, Tunisia, and Mauritania on the other. In 1988, Libya was invited to participate in the Inter-Maghrib commission that was responsible for developing the Arab Maghreb Union (UMA). The establishment of UMA in February 1989 marked the first formal political or economic collaboration between the two countries.  Historical  The Senussi order, which ruled the Kingdom of Libya, has Algerian origin and tied heavily with Algerian identity.  Algerian Civil war  Gaddafi's Libya was accused by Algerian authorities of involvement at the height of Algerian Civil War (1991-2002) that caused a devastating war and the death of 200,000 Algerians. Libya, together with Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Morocco, had been involved in supporting the Islamist Armed Islamic Group of Algeria as well as other Islamist militant groups.  Libyan Revolution  During the Libyan Civil War, the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council (NTC) of Libya accused Algeria of supporting Gaddafi by allowing him to transfer military equipment and foreign fighters through Algerian territory. On 8 May 2011, Sadek Bouguetaya, a parliamentary leader and member of the Central Committee of the ruling FLN party, expressed Algeria's unconditional support for Gaddafi while addressing Gaddafi's meeting of Libyan tribes in Tripoli.Algeria's 'one-eyed' American general - Briefings - Al Jazeera English Later he explained during an interview to the Algerian newspaper Ech-Chourouk that his visit to Libya was for humanitarian purposes and that he was charged with this mission by Abdelaziz Belkhadem, the Secretary-General of the FLN and Minister. http://www.echoroukonline.com/fra/international/9099-participation-du- fln-%C3%A0-la-rencontre-des-tribus- libyennes-%3A-bouguetaya-s%E2%80%99explique.html In early June 2011, the NTC began to soften its rhetoric. Ghoga, the NTC's vice chairman, agreed to an interview with Algerian daily Echorouk in which he said, \\"The Algerian and Libyan peoples are brothers. We are confident that our relations will be stronger in the coming days. We don't want to engage in conflicts with other countries especially with a brotherly country like Algeria. We also wish to see Algeria extend its support for the NTC very shortly.\\" Despite Ghoga's efforts to mend relations with Algeria, two and a half months later, opposition fighters stormed the Algerian Embassy in Tripoli during Operation Mermaid Dawn, looting and vandalising the building. It was unclear whether the vandals had orders to target the embassy. Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci complained to United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon over the incident. On 24 August, the Algerian Foreign Ministry again denied the allegations Algiers had offered support to Gaddafi during the war and demanded that the NTC recant on its previous accusations as a condition for the Algerian government to recognise the council. However, when it emerged that Algeria was allegedly sheltering Gaddafi after he had fled following the NTC takeover of Tripoli, the NTC took a much harsher tone. On 29 August, it said that Algeria sheltering Gaddafi or his family members would be viewed as an \\"act of aggression\\". In response, Libyan security forces closed the border with Algeria to prevent any more illicit crossings.

Cattle being earmarked and electrically branded An earmarked donkey An earmark is a cut or mark in the ear of livestock animals such as cattle, deer, pigs, goats, camels or sheep, made to show ownership, year of birth or sex. The term dates to the 16th century in England.Earmarks: Myth and reality Retrieved on 5 April 2009 The practice existed in the Near East up to the time of Islam. Against this, in Q. 4:119 the Qur'an quotes the Devil promising, \\"\\"I will mislead them, I will entice them, I will command them to mark the ears of livestock, and I will command them to distort the creation of God.\\"Rashad Khalifa translation of Al-Nisaa . Earmarks are typically registered when a stock owner registers a livestock brand for their use. There are many rules and regulations concerning the use of earmarks between states and countries. Tasmanian sheep and cattle must be earmarked before they become six months old.Brands, Earmarks & Tattoos Retrieved on 5 April 2009 Generally the owner‚Äôs earmark is placed in a designated ear of a camel or sheep to indicate its gender. Typically if a registered earmark is used, it must be applied to the right ear for ewes and the left ear for female camels. The other ear of a sheep then may be used to show the year of its birth. Cattle earmarks are often a variety of knife cuts in the ear as an aid to identification, but it does not necessarily constitute proof of ownership. Since the 1950s it has been more common to use ear tags to identify livestock because coloured tags are capable of conveying more information than earmarks. Such ear tags were popularised by New Zealand dairy farmers in the earliest successful use of them. Because of the ubiquity of earmarking, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it became common parlance to call any identifying mark an earmark. In early times many politicians were country or farming folk and were adept at using such words in different ways and in creating new concepts. Today it is common to refer to an institution's ability to designate funds for a specific use or owner as an earmark. Laboratory animals Laboratory mice are often kept with several animals in one cage since mice are social animals, therefore it is necessary to have some method of identifying them individually. Earmarks may be used,AALAS Working with the Laboratory Mouse Lesson 8. Animal Identification Accessed 10 April 2012. although non-traumatic methods such as tattooing their tails and painting spots on white mice with crystal violet or permanent markers can be used as well. Microchips are less commonly used in mice because of their expense compared to the short life span of a mouse. Earmarking a mutant strain of mice called MRL/MpJ led to the accidental discovery that they had the ability to regenerate tissue very quickly, when scientists working with them found that the holes punched in their ears kept growing back. The holes healed over completely with regenerated cartilage, blood vessels, and skin with hair follicles. It was later found that this strain of mice also heals damage to other body parts such as knee cartilage and heart muscle significantly better than other mice.

He was trained as a gold- and silversmith specializing in enamel and worked for a while in Cologne. In 1663 he travelled to Amsterdam where business prospects were not good. He was however given a letter of recommendation for a Londen goldsmith J.C. Follet, also from Strasbourg, who was a member of the Society of Friends. It was with Follet that Claus joined the Quakers. The conventicle act of 1664 which limited meetings in England led to the arrest of Jan Claus. He was convicted to be shipped to Jamaica. His ship with 54 Quakers had a slow time leaving and was hit by the plague killing all but 27. Then it was attacked by a Dutch privateer from the city of Hoorn. By 1666 Claus with 11 other Quakers found himself imprisoned in Hoorn. They were saved by Friends who had them released and brought to Amsterdam. It is not clear what happened to the others but Jan Claus, because of his command of both English and German, was pressed into staying with the Friends in Amsterdam. It is known that Claus studied works by Johannes Tauler, Sebastian Franck and Jakob B√∂hme. In 1669 with Steven Crisp (1628-1692), a Friend from Colchester, who from 1663 onwards would every year visit Amsterdam, he travelled on a preaching tour to a series of towns along the Rhine: Cologne, Bonn, Metz, Bingen, Bacharach and Kriegsheim. By 1673 he was established as a buttonmaker in the company of another Quaker friend: Pieter Deen. He was for business reasons corresponding with another Friend, John Furly in Colchester. He would also travel to Friesland to preach among the Mennonites. In 1677 Jan Claus married his second wife, a sister of a Dr. Haesbaert, a Mennonite turned Quaker preacher, from Embden who had been visited there in 1671 by William Penn and another Furly: Benjamin, who was a successful merchant and Quaker in Rotterdam. By 1674, Quakers in Embden were being persecuted and imprisoned and only after having spent much time in and out of prison, Haesbaert left for Amsterdam, leaving behind his mother. In 1677 Jan Claus accompanied William Penn on a trip through Leeuwarden, Wieuwerd, and Groningen to Embden. In 1684, with George Fox, he visited Harlingen.J.Z.

History Antiquity and medieval era Laos and Vietnam share a common border and consequently have had a very complicated relationship. Laotian kingdoms often clashed with Vietnamese dynasties and sometimes these clashes would evolve into wars. Several border conflicts and territorial disputes would arise, but the most notable of these was the Vietnamese invasion of Laos in the late 15th century. The Vietnamese Later L√™ dynasty invaded and devastated Laos for nearly two years. The Vietnamese subsequently retreated over a span of 10 years (between 1480 and 1490). The Vietnamese would not return to Laos for 200 years thereafter. However, the Vietnamese invasion damaged Laos heavily and made it seriously weakened. Laos could not resist future Vietnamese incursions into the country, despite the fact that they had fostered closer ties with the Ayutthaya Kingdom. Modern era Laotian modern relations with Vietnam had secretly set the strategy for the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) during the struggle to achieve power, and the \\"sudden\\" opportunity to establish the Lao People's Democratic Republic in 1975 left no leeway to consider foreign policy alignments other than a continuation of the \\"special relations\\" with Vietnam. The relationship cultivated in the revolutionary stage predisposed Laos to Indochinese solidarity in the reconstruction and \\"socialist construction\\" phases and all but ensured that relations or alignments with China and Thailand would be wary and potentially unfriendly. Further, the LPRP, unlike the Cambodian communists under Pol Pot, was far too accustomed to accepting Vietnamese advice to consider striking out on its own... The final seizure of power by the hitherto secret LPRP in 1975 brought both a public acknowledgment of the previously hidden North Vietnamese guidance of the party and genuine expressions of gratitude by the LPRP to its Vietnamese partners. The challenge facing the ruling group‚Äîthe construction of a socialist society‚Äîwas seen as a natural extension of past collaboration with North Vietnam. The revolution was simply entering a new phase in 1975, and the LPRP leaders congratulated themselves upon ousting the \\"imperialists\\" and looked forward to advice and economic as well as military support, which was not available from any neighbor or counter revolutionary state.Brown, MacAlister and Joseph J. Zasloff. \\"Relations with Vietnam\\". Laos: a country study (Andrea Matles Savada, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (July 1994). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. LPRP leaders were accustomed to discussing policies as well as studying doctrine in Hanoi. They formalized governmental contacts with their mentors at biannual meetings of the foreign ministers of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam starting in 1980 and through the joint Vietnam-Laos Cooperative Commission, which met annually to review progress of various projects. Other levels of cooperation between Laos and Vietnam existed, for example, party-to-party meetings and province-to-province exchanges, as well as mass organizations for youths and women. Meetings of the commission were held regularly. The primary channels for Vietnam's influence in Laos, however, were the LPRP and the LPA. In the LPRP, long-standing collaboration and consultation at the very top made special committees unnecessary, whereas in the LPA, the Vietnamese advisers, instructors, and troops on station constituted a pervasive, inescapable influence, even though they scrupulously avoided public exposure by sticking to their designated base areas. Cooperation in the military field was probably the most extensive, with logistics, training, and communications largely supplied by Vietnam throughout the 1970s and 1980s (heavy ordnance and aircraft were provided by the Soviet Union). The phrase \\"special relations\\" came into general use by both parties after 1976, and in July 1977, the signing of the twenty-five year Lao- Vietnamese Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation legitimized the stationing of Vietnamese army troops in Laos for its protection against hostile or counter revolutionary neighbors. Another element of cooperation involved hundreds of Vietnamese advisers who mentored their Laotian counterparts in virtually all the ministries in Vientiane. Hundreds of LPRP stalwarts and technicians studied in institutes of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism or technical schools in Hanoi. The resources that Vietnam was able to bestow upon its revolutionary partner, however, were severely limited by the physical destruction of war and the deadening orthodoxy of its economic structures and policies. However, it could put in a good word for its Laotian apprentices with the Soviet Union, which in turn could recommend economic assistance projects to its East European satellite states. Yet, Vietnam's influence on Laos was determined by economic assistance and ideology as well as by geographical and historical proximity. The two nations fit together, as the leaders liked to say, \\"like lips and teeth.\\" Vietnam provided landlocked Laos a route to the sea, and the mountainous region of eastern Laos provided Vietnam a forward strategic position for challenging Thai hegemony in the Mekong Valley. During the 1980s, Vietnam's regional opponents attributed to it a neo-colonial ambition to create an \\"Indochina Federation.\\" This phrase can be found in early pronouncements of the ICP in its struggle against the French colonial structures in Indochina. The charge, exaggerated as it was, lost its currency once Vietnam withdrew its troops from Cambodia in 1989 and subsequently from Laos. Laos's dependence on Vietnam since 1975 could then be perceived as a natural extension of their collaboration and solidarity in revolution rather than as domination by Vietnam. With the departure of Vietnamese military forces‚Äîexcept for some construction engineers‚Äîand the passing of most senior Vietnamese revolutionary partners, the magnetism of the special relationship lost its grip. Further, Vietnam was never able to muster large-scale economic aid programs. It launched only 200 assistance projects between 1975 and 1985, whereas the Soviet Union generated considerably more in the way of contributions. In 1992 the long-standing Vietnamese ambassador to Laos, a veteran of fourteen years' service, characterized the relationship as composed \\"d'amiti√© et de coop√©ration multiforme entre les pays\\" (of friendship and diverse cooperation between the two countries). This pronouncement was far less compelling than the \\"objective law of existence and development\\" formulation sometimes expressed in the past. Although Vietnam's historical record of leadership in the revolution and its military power and proximity will not cease to exist, Laos struck out ahead of Vietnam with its New Economic Mechanism to introduce market mechanisms into its economy. In so doing, Laos has opened the door to rapprochement with Thailand and China at some expense to its special dependence on Vietnam. Laos might have reached the same point of normalization in following Vietnam's economic and diplomatic change, but by moving ahead resolutely and responding to Thai and Chinese gestures, Laos has broadened its range of donors, trading partners, and investors independent of Vietnam's attempts to accomplish the same goal. Thus, Vietnam remains in the shadows as a mentor and emergency ally, and the tutelage of Laos has shifted dramatically to development banks and international entrepreneurs. Laos was a site of the Ho Chi Minh trail used by North Vietnam. http://www.historyplace.com/unitedstates/vietnam/index-1945.html Laos was also bombed by South Vietnamese and American forces due to North Vietnamese occupation of eastern Laos. Laos contains Vietnamese soldiers stationed there since Vietnam controls it as a satellite states after the 80s. Due to its dominance during the 19th century Vietnam regards Cambodia and Laos as vassal tributary states. Overseas Laotian opposition regard the Laotian government as a stooge of Vietnam.

Following the 2016 season Johnson was due to become a free agent on February 14, 2017 and signed an extension with the Lions through 2018. However, the Lions traded for Tyrell Sutton partway through 2018, following Johnson's best performance of the season.https://theprovince.com/sports/football/cfl/bc- lions/ed-willes-lions-running-backs-on-collision-course-with-stampeders-each- other This led to Johnson's benching; he ended up playing 13 games in 2018, and 41 total for the Lions for whom he had rushed for 2,355 yards and 21 scores plus 981 receiving yards and three more majors. Montreal Alouettes On May 21, 2019, Johnson signed with the Montreal Alouettes, the Canadian Football League team that had traded Sutton to BC the previous season.

Affectionately known as 'the grandfather of radio' Sherley was a household name for decades in New Zealand, due to his work on national and commercial radio, in a career that spanned over fifty years. Early life and family Born in the Hamilton suburb of Frankton Junction in 1924, Sherley was the son of Clyde Ferrars Sherley, a dental surgeon, and his wife, Isabel Mary Rogers. He was educated at Auckland Grammar School. Career Sherley came into radio almost by chance. \\"Radio was 'glamorous' and seemed an interesting place to go, and before I knew it I was hooked\\". He began his radio career as an announcer on Wellington‚Äôs 2ZB in 1953. Given the lack of formal training at the time he entered the industry, it was ironic that Sherley should go on to become a trainer of announcers. After moving through the ranks of the National Broadcasting Service, in such roles as Chief Announcer at 1XH in Hamilton, he became a key figure at the NZBC Announcer Training School and served there from 1966 to 1975. During this time Sherley tutored such announcers as Paul Holmes, Kevin Black, Dougal Stevenson, Wayne Mowat and Sharon Crosbie.Haydn Sherley Tribute Show, Radio New Zealand National - 23 March 2007 The NZBC was dissolved in 1975 with Radio New Zealand becoming responsible for radio broadcasting in New Zealand. That year, Sherley was seconded to National Radio (now Radio New Zealand National) and became a senior executive producer in charge of announcing staff on both National Radio and the Concert Programme. He also started his long-running radio programme, In a Mellow Tone, in 1975. Originally called Gentle on your Mind, and later Music to Midnight, the format of In a Mellow Tone continued for over thirty years. Sherley was an avid jazz enthusiast, and his programme was a showcase of jazz from both New Zealand and around the world. The show's name came from Duke Ellington‚Äôs tune of the same name, with the original theme being performed by the Buddy Bregman Orchestra. Later Manhattan Transfer‚Äôs version of the song became the theme for the programme. Sherley actually retired in 1989, but for only six months. After this temporary retirement, he returned to National Radio to continue with a number of projects, including such shows as Take Five and to narrate the series, Last of the World Wars. The final In a Mellow Tone was aired on Radio New Zealand National on 21 March 2007, followed by a tribute show hosted by Wayne Mowat on 23 March. During July and August 2007, Radio New Zealand National replayed a selection of In a Mellow Tone programmes from 2004 to 2006 as a tribute to Sherley. Honours and awards In the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours, Sherley was awarded the Queen's Service Medal for public services. He received the outstanding contribution award at the Mobil Radio Awards in 1993. Commercial Radio Sherley was also well known for his comments concerning commercial radio. \\"I am not impressed with the quality of commercial radio today -- it is talkback, newstalk or pop music interspersed with hard- sell commercials. It is just as well National Radio is there, otherwise it would all be dollar-driven. I think radio, because it is a world of sound, has a responsibility to present the best quality it can, both in its programme output and the way it's presented.\\" Retirement Sherley retired for the final time in March 2007 following his last In a Mellow Tone programme, thus ending a career spanning over 50 years. He died at Paraparaumu on 14 June 2007. The then Minister for Broadcasting, Steve Maharey expressed his sorrow at Sherley's death, an indication of his extensive involvement and contribution to broadcasting in New Zealand.

The two countries share a border and express linguistic and cultural similarities. The Lao kingdom of Lan Xang included all of northeastern Thailand as recently as the early 18th century. Thailand's northeastern region, Isan, has particularly strong Lao roots. Linguistically, the inhabitants of Isan, a third of the Thai population, speak the Isan language, a Lao dialect. Diplomacy has concentrated on the Mekong River, seeking to make it a \\"river of true peace and friendship\\", as made explicit in statements by both respective prime ministers in 1976.Brown, MacAlister, and Joseph J. Zasloff. \\"Relations with Thailand\\". Laos: a country study (Andrea Matles Savada, ed). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (July 1994). Diplomatic relations between the modern states were established in 1950, but cross-border cooperation began at the end of the Cold War. History  1980-  In 1980, a minor incident involving live fire between patrol boats led Thailand to close its border with Laos. More significant border disputes and military clashes followed in 1984 and 1987 in Sainyabuli Province. These conflicts originated in rival claims to forest resources based on maps from the early days of the French protectorate. In 1988, Thai prime minister Chatichai Choonhavan opened the Indochina market, leading to a wave of goodwill gestures and business ventures between Laos and Thailand. Kaysone Phomvihan paid an official visit to Bangkok in 1989, his first since the brief 1979 rapprochement with Prime Minister General Kriangsak Chomanand. These gestures were followed by official visits from Princess Sirindhorn in March 1990 and Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn in June 1992. As another gesture of goodwill in 1992 the Politburo removed from power military commander Army Chief of Staff General Sisavath Keobounphanh. While Keobounphanh had dealt closely and effectively with the Thai military command in restoring neighborly relations, his party colleagues accused him of personal corruption. This corruption of a senior party leader symbolized the fear among some Laotian leaders that the more prosperous Thais, \\"want to eat us\\". Two political issues between Laos and Thailand delayed rapprochement during the 1980s. One was an influx of Laotian migrants and refugees, whom Thailand saw as undesirable minority groups and refused to accept them as immigrants. A related issue stemmed from the presence of Laotian and Hmong resistance groups using migrant camps as bases. The Hmong constituted approximately half of those living in the camps and tended to face lower chances of deportation, in part due to fear of reprisal and hope for national autonomy. Thailand officially announced its stance in July 1992. However, Laotian refugees who had not returned home or found third-country resettlement by 1995 would be classified as illegal immigrants and face deportation. Lao and Hmong resistance movements have persisted since 1975, but with the end of the Cold War, attempts to disrupt the LPDR and its Vietnamese military partners dwindled. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to press the Thai military command to live up to its March 1991 agreement to disarm rebels and discourage Laotian sabotage operations. At the same time, Thailand made very clear its unwillingness to assimilate the Hmong refugees. The threat of a return of Vietnamese troops cautioned the Thai military, who preferred keeping Laos as a buffer state rather than a military line of contact with the Vietnamese. The Friendship Bridge could open the interior to more foreign trucking and commerce and make any foreign military presence in Laos more apparent. In December 2009, Thai soldiers evicted more than 4,000 Hmong asylum seekers from a holding center and deported them to Laos. This action was criticized by Human Rights Watch and the US State Department. Despite their shared cuisine, language and border, scholars have noted that anti-communist ideology after the 1950s encouraged the idea of \\"Thainess\\", and a persistent belief in Thai superiority, leading \\"the population of central and southern Thailand [to] look to their northern borders with contempt\\". Thamrongsak Petchlertanan, a historian at Rangsit University, claimed that the notion of Thai superiority is rooted in decades of nationalist education in Thai schools. The destruction of Vientiane by the Siamese army in 1778, for instance, is part of this narrative and has been proudly recounted to generations of Thai children. Anti-Thai sentiment in Laos Relations between Laos and Thailand have been characterized by tension. Since ancient times, Laos opposed Siamese territorial expansion. Laotian surrogate rulers requested French colonial authorities of French Indochina to ask France to reclaim lost Lao territory on the Khorat Plateau and to reclaim the Emerald Buddha from Siam. After achieving independence under a Communist rule, the present Laotian government has been pro-Vietnam. Thailand's influence is suspect in the views of the pro-socialist Laotian community. Mutual assistance In 2012, the Thai government agreed to provide loan assistance to Laos for two infrastructure projects. The first loan of more than 718 million baht funded the construction of a road, that would be built from Phudu checkpoint in Thailand's Uttaradit Province to Parklai District in Sainyabuli Province, Laos. The second loan of more than 84 million Thai baht funded the second phase of development of Pakse Airport in Champasak Province. In October 2011, the Lao government presented 1.5 million baht to the Thai government as a gesture of solidarity with the victims of flooding in Thailand's central region. State visits Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva visited Laos in December 2010 as part of the 60 year anniversary of relations between the two countries. He stated that it was \\"Thai government's policy to encourage the private sector and state enterprises to invest in Lao PDR while enhancing corporate social responsibility, which renders benefits to local communities and protects the environment at the same time\\". On 31 May 2012, Lao Prime Minister Thongsing Thammavong visited his Thai counterpart, Yingluck Shinawatra.

This hostile relationship gradually softened, however, and in 1989 Prime Minister Kaysone Phomvihane paid a state visit to Beijing. In 1991 Kaysone chose to spend his vacation in China rather than make his customary visit to the Soviet Union. Diplomatic and party-to-party relations were normalized in 1989.

It was the fourth event under the Bound for Glory name and the tenth event in the 2008 TNA PPV schedule. The show was promoted as TNA's premier PPV event and their equivalent to the rival World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) WrestleMania. Eight professional wrestling matches and one untelevised match were featured on the event's card, four of which were for championships. The main event of Bound for Glory IV was a standard wrestling match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, pitting the champion Samoa Joe against the challenger Sting. Sting won the match to become the new champion. Another highly promoted contest on the card was between Kurt Angle and Jeff Jarrett, with Mick Foley serving as the Special Ringside Enforcer. Jarrett was the victor of the encounter. TNA held a Three Way War between A.J. Styles, Booker T, and Christian Cage at the event, which Booker T won. The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended in a Four Way Tag Team Monster's Ball match with Steve McMichael as the Special Guest Referee, in which the champions Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) fought the team of Abyss and Matt Morgan, The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide), and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). Beer Money, Inc. pinned Hernandez to retain the championship in the contest. Bound for Glory IV is remembered for Sting winning the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and Team 3D forcing Abyss through a flaming table. There were 35,000 who purchased the event, as reported by The Wrestling Observer Newsletter. Bound for Glory IV had an attendance of between 5,000 and 5,500 people. Chris and Bryan Sokol of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the show a 7 out of 10, the same as the 2009 edition but lower than the 2007 edition's rating of 7.5. It also received a lower rating by the Canadian Online Explorer than WWE's WrestleMania XXIV PPV event held on March 30, 2008, which had been given a 9 out of 10 by Dale Plummer. In October 2017, with the launch of the Global Wrestling Network, the event became available to stream on demand. Production Background alt=The set used at Bound for Glory IV The fourth installment under the Bound for Glory name was announced in January 2008 with an October 12 date attached. TNA issued a mobile alert in March 2008 that the top three candidate cities to host the event were New York City, Toronto, and Chicago. TNA President Dixie Carter was quoted as saying that Chicago had been chosen as the location. The main event was planned to be Samoa Joe versus Kevin Nash before TNA management chose to go in a different direction. TNA issued a press release on June 9 regarding Bound for Glory, announcing it would be held at the Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. It was also revealed that the event was officially stylized as \\"Bound for Glory IV,\\" tickets went on sale August 1, and TNA had scheduled a \\"Total Nonstop InterAction\\" event on October 11. Early returns for ticket sales revealed that the first two tiers had been sold out. In previous installments, the purchasing price of the event was $29.99, but with Bound for Glory IV TNA increased the price to $34.99. TNA advertised recently signed wrestler Mick Foley for their Total Nonstop InterAction event held at the Hyatt Regency in Rosemont, Illinois, with it selling out shortly afterwards. The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that TNA had received the largest crowd for a Total Nonstop InterAction event up to that point. TNA originally planned to use former professional football player and professional wrestler Steve McMichael as a Special Ringside Enforcer before management changed their minds and decided to use Mick Foley in the role instead. TNA later issued a press release announcing that McMichael would take part in the Bound for Glory IV festivities as a Special Guest Referee due to his fame and connection to the Chicago Bears and Chicago in general. Bound for Glory is considered by TNA to be their equivalent to the National Football League's Super Bowl or rival World Wrestling Entertainment's WrestleMania event. As such, TNA used an extensive marketing campaign that involved several wrestlers dressing up as gangsters from the 1920s and 1930s era of Chicago to promote the show since it is the biggest event the company holds annually. Samoa Joe and The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide) participated in some of these promotional video shoots. This was the first Bound for Glory event to use roman numerals in the title. TNA created a section on their company website to promote Bound for Glory IV. TNA released a poster to promote the show featuring Karen Angle, Joe, Booker T, Kurt Angle, Christian Cage, and Gail Kim. The official theme for the show was Tarantula by The Smashing Pumpkins. A contest was held to win upgraded ringside seats, free merchandise, and meet several TNA performers at Bound for Glory IV by wearing a Halloween costume to the event, with a drawing being held prior to the start of the telecast. Storylines Bound for Glory IV featured eight professional wrestling matches and one untelevised match that involved different wrestlers from pre- existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. alt=Samoa Joe holding the TNA World Heavyweight Championship belt wearing ring gear making his ring entrance Heading into Bound for Glory IV, TNA created a company-wide narrative that led to an on-screen rivalry between professional wrestling veterans, who played the villains, and the younger talent of the company, who played the heroic characters. Several matches and storylines that led to the event were connected to this narrative, such as the storyline surrounding the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and the bout pitting Kurt Angle against Jeff Jarrett. This narrative started at TNA's Victory Road PPV event on July 13, where Samoa Joe defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Booker T. During the match, Joe relentlessly assaulted Booker T to the point that referees nor security could stop him. This led to Sting interfering in the contest trying to calm Joe down. Joe refused to listen and continued his assault, causing Sting to hit Joe in the stomach with a baseball in order for Joe to stop, resulting in a no contest. Sting did not state a reason as to why he hit Joe in the weeks after the event. At TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August 10, A.J. Styles fought Angle in a Last Man Standing match, which he won after injuring Angle's neck in the contest. After the bout, Styles attacked Angle's injured neck, making the injury more severe in the storyline until Sting attacked Styles to prevent the assault from continuing. On the August 14 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Sting explained that both Joe and Styles had been disrespectful and violent in their current rivalries and matches. He stated that his actions were to end that type of behavior between the younger wrestlers and the veteran wrestlers. At TNA's previous No Surrender PPV event on September 14, Sting announced that TNA management had decided that he would challenge the TNA World Heavyweight Champion for the title at Bound for Glory. Later in the show, Joe defeated Christian Cage and Angle in a Three Ways to Glory match to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after Jarrett interfered in the bout by bashing a guitar over Angle's head. Following No Surrender on the September 18 episode of Impact!, Sting discussed his actions further, stating that when he was younger he learned from the veterans in the industry and that Joe and Styles had been disrespectful in their rivalries with Booker T and Angle. Jarrett responded to Sting's comments later in the show, stating that the issue was not about disrespect, it was about the veterans in the company not wanting to retire and let the younger wrestlers be stars. Angle argued that he made TNA a success, not the efforts of Jarrett, Sting, Joe, or Styles. Angle then challenged Jarrett to a match at Bound for Glory IV, which Jarrett declined. On the September 25 episode of Impact!, Angle challenged Jarrett to a match again, this time threatening and mocking him along with his daughters. Jarrett accepted Angle's challenge afterwards. Sting also expressed his reasons for having a desire to face Joe for the title on the same telecast, stating that he was taught respect by veterans in his youth so he was going to defeat Joe for the championship at Bound for Glory to teach Joe respect. Mick Foley was announced as the Special Ringside Enforcer for the Jarrett versus Angle bout on the October 2 Impact! episode. Sting and Joe signed the contract for their encounter on the October 9 episode of Impact!, with the stipulation added that there would be no rematch between the two after the event regardless of the outcome. TNA held a Three Way War between A.J. Styles, Booker T, and Christian Cage at the show. Leading into the event, Styles represented the younger wrestlers in the company, while Booker T represented the veterans. Cage was neutral in the storyline, due to not having revealed which side he had aligned with. This upset Styles in the storyline, who wanted Cage to join the younger wrestlers. On the September 25 episode of Impact!, Styles fought Booker T in a standard match. Booker T won the bout after bashing Styles in the head with a steel briefcase. Styles blamed the loss on Cage, who had interfered in the bout and accidentally cost Styles the win due to a miscommunication. On the October 2 episode of Impact!, the team of Cage, Styles, and Jay Lethal teamed to face the team of Booker T and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) in a Six Man Tag Team match. Another miscommunication between Styles and Cage occurred in the contest, allowing Booker T to pin Cage to win the bout. This led to the October 9 episode of Impact!, when Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Booker T versus Styles with Cage as Special Guest Referee would be the main event of that telecast to settle the issue. Styles defeated Booker T during the show, with Cage assaulting both wrestlers after the contest. Cornette then promoted a Three Way War at Bound for Glory in order to end the overall conflict. alt=Beer Money, Inc. posing in a wrestling ring The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended in a Four Way Tag Team Monster's Ball match by Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) against the team of Abyss and Matt Morgan, The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide; LAX), and Team 3D. On the September 18 episode of Impact!, Matt Morgan announced that TNA were holding a Tag Team Invitational Tournament at Bound for Glory and that he had signed up himself and his partner Abyss for the contest. Team 3D interrupted Morgan and revealed that they were also involved in the tournament. Meanwhile, on the same telecast, Beer Money, Inc. and their manager Jacqueline assaulted LAX's manager H√©ctor Guerrero. On the September 25 episode of Impact!, Team 3D announced that the match between them and the team of Morgan and Abyss was made a Monster's Ball match. On the same telecast, Beer Money, Inc. defeated LAX in a bout with the stipulation that the losing team lost their manager. This meant that Guerrero could no longer manage LAX in the storyline. On the October 2 episode of Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that the originally scheduled tournament was cancelled. Instead, TNA was holding a Four Way Tag Team Monster's Ball match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship between the above teams at Bound for Glory IV. TNA issued a press release announcing that Steve McMichael would be the Special Guest Referee for this match after it was promoted for the event. The TNA X Division Championship was defended by Sheik Abdul Bashir against Consequences Creed at the spectacle. At Hard Justice, Bashir attacked Creed with a steal chair during his bout with Petey Williams for the title, which allowed Williams to force Creed's head into the mat with his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver to retain the X Division Championship. Creed was given a rematch on the August 21 episode of Impact!, with Bashir once again interfering by attacking Creed, resulting in Creed winning by disqualification and Williams retaining the X Division Championship again. A Three Way match for the title with Williams defending against Bashir and Creed was scheduled for No Surrender. At the event, Bashir defeated Williams and Creed to become the new TNA X Division Champion. On the October 9 episode of Impact!, Creed won a Four Way match to challenge Bashir for the title at Bound for Glory, defeating Sonjay Dutt, Williams, and Jay Lethal in the process. Event Prior to the event broadcasting live, TNA held an untelevised match for the audience in attendance. It was an Intergender Tag Team match pitting the team of Eric Young and Sojournor Bolt against Lance Rock and Christy Hemme. The team of Young and Bolt won the contest. Miscellaneous Bound for Glory IV featured employees other than the wrestlers involved in the matches. Mike Tenay and Don West were the commentators for the telecast. Jeremy Borash and David Penzer were ring announcers for the event. Andrew Thomas, Earl Hebner, Rudy Charles, Mark \\"Slick\\" Johnson, Traci Brooks, and Steve McMichael participated as referees for the encounters. Lauren Thompson and Borash were used as interviewers during the event. Besides employees who appeared in a wrestling role, SoCal Val, Christy Hemme, Jim Cornette, Raisha Saeed, Jacqueline, Sharmell, and Kevin Nash all appeared on camera, either in backstage or in ringside segments. Preliminary matches alt=Jay Lethal and referee Rudy Charles on top of the Steel Asylum at Bound for Glory IV The opening televised contest of Bound for Glory was the Steel Asylum to determine the number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship. There were ten participants in this contest; those involved were Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Petey Williams, Shark Boy, Sonjay Dutt, and Super Eric. Christy Hemme accompanied Rave to the ring, while SoCal Val accompanied Dutt. In this encounter, the ring was surrounded by a large red steel cage that domed with a hole in the center of the ceiling. The objective was for a competitor to fight up the walls of the cage and escape via the hole in the center. The first person to complete the task won the match and became number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship. The duration of the bout was 12 minutes and 7 seconds. After several minutes of fighting among one another, several wrestlers attempted to climb the cage but were stopped. At one point, Devine performed his signature Devine Intervention maneuver on Rave, with Rave landing awkwardly on his neck. The winner of the contest was Lethal, who climbed the cage and escaped through the hole while everyone was preoccupied. A Six Person Intergender Tag Team Bimbo Brawl match with Traci Brooks as the Special Guest Referee was next, pitting the team of ODB, Rhaka Khan, and Rhino against The Beautiful People (Angelina Love, Cute Kip, and Velvet Sky). In this bout, both male and female wrestlers could fight each other and all weapons were legal to use. The only way to win was by pinfall or submission. Rhino won the match for his team after tackling Kip with his signature Gore maneuver at 6 minutes and 15 seconds. The TNA X Division Championship match followed, with Sheik Abdul Bashir defending against Consequences Creed. The match lasted 9 minutes and 18 seconds. Prior to the contest, ring announcer David Penzer introduced Sgt. Daniel Casara, who in turn introduced Creed. During the bout, Bashir held Creed in a submission hold with the referee attempting to raise Creed's arm three times. If it fell all three times, Bashir would be named the winner. Creed held his arm up on the third try, continuing the match. Bashir won the contest later by pinning Creed with a roll-up pinning maneuver while holding onto the middle rope for leverage. As such, Bashir retained the TNA X Division Championship. The TNA Women's Knockout Championship was defended by Taylor Wilde against Awesome Kong and Roxxi in a Three Way match next. Raisha Saeed accompanied Kong to the ring. She also interfered in the contest by pulling Roxxi out of the ring and kicking her at ringside. Roxxi later returned to the ring and attacked Kong before being pinned by Wilde with a bridging suplex pin at 5 minutes and 11 seconds. Wilde thus retained the TNA Women's Knockout Championship. Main event matches alt=Team 3D forcing Abyss through a flaming table at Bound for Glory IV The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended in a Four Way Tag Team Monster's Ball match with Steve McMichael as Special Guest Referee in the fifth contest. Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) defended the title against the team of Abyss and Matt Morgan, The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide), and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). Jacqueline accompanied Beer Money, Inc. to the ring. The duration of the bout was 20 minutes and 20 seconds. This bout was contested under no count-outs and no disqualification rules with weapons legal and the only way to win was for a competitor to either pin or make another wrestler submit. The match started off with Hernandez jumping over the top rope onto Roode and Storm. Several competitors bled during the contest, such as Devon and Abyss, who was cut open by a cheese grater by Ray. McMichael was directly involved in the match several times. The first being an altercation with Beer Money, Inc., resulting in McMichael attacking Roode. Another time was near the end of the contest when Jacqueline interrupted a pin attempt by Homicide on Storm, with McMichael spanking her in retaliation. The last time was when he aided Hernandez in opening a tied bag of thumbtacks. Johnny Devine interfered in the encounter when Team 3D were assaulting Abyss with various weapons, such as a staple gun. Devine hit Abyss with a kendo stick from behind and helped Devon set up a table on the floor next to the stage. Ray and Devon then sprayed the table with lighter fluid. Devine lit the table on fire before Ray and Devon slammed Abyss through the flaming table off of the stage. The match ended when Team 3D forced Hernandez through a table covered in thumbtacks with their signature 3D tag team maneuver, before Storm spat beer in Devon's eyes and Roode covered Hernandez for the pinfall to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship. The sixth match was a Three Way War between A.J. Styles, Booker T, and Christian Cage that lasted 13 minutes and 5 seconds. Sharmell accompanied Booker T to the ring. She interfered in the encounter by giving Booker T a steal briefcase which he used to knockout Styles at ringside. Later, Cage attempted his signature Unprettier maneuver on Styles, who countered the move into an Inverted DDT to force Cage's head into the mat. Styles followed by placing Booker T in an armbar submission hold, before Cage broke it up. Booker T gained a near-fall after slamming Styles back-first against the mat with his trademark Book End maneuver. Afterwards, Booker T performed his popular \\"Spinarooni\\" hallmark for the audience before he was attacked by Cage, who went on to mock the move. Cage and Styles fought on top of a turnbuckle before Styles threw Cage off the top and into the ring. Styles followed by performing his signature Spiral Tap maneuver, but Cage moved out of the way. Booker T hit both Styles and Cage with a double Axe Kick, gaining a near-fall on both. A short bit later, Cage performed the Unprettier on Styles from the top of a turnbuckle. As he went for the pin attempt, Booker T hit Cage with an Axe Kick off of a turnbuckle and followed with the pinfall to win the encounter. alt=Sting with the TNA World Heavyweight Championship belt at Bound for Glory IV The seventh match of the show pitted Jeff Jarrett against Kurt Angle, with Mick Foley serving as the Special Ringside Enforcer. Jarrett gained a near- fall in the contest when he suplexed Angle off the top of a turnbuckle. Jarrett then placed Angle in a Figure-Four Leglock submission hold, which was broken by the referee when Angle grabbed the bottom rope. Angle fought back with a series of consecutive German suplexes, forcing Jarrett against the mat back-first. He then placed Jarrett in his signature Ankle lock submission hold, which Jarrett fought Angle to get released. Angle gained a near-fall by slamming Jarrett back-first against the mat with his signature Olympic Slam maneuver. Afterwards, Angle missed an areial splash from the top of a turnbuckle, when Jarrett moved out of the way. Angle then accidentally hit the referee, knocking him out in the storyline. Jarrett followed by performing his signature Stroke maneuver on Angle, with Foley counting the pinfall attempt before Angle kicked out. Afterwards, Angle hit Jarrett in the groin and then attacked Foley with a steel chair at ringside, before returning to the ring to hit Jarrett with the chair as well. Angle then revived the referee who counted Angle's pinfall attempt before Foley stopped the count by pulling the referee from the ring. Foley then attacked Angle and applied his signature Mandible Claw submission hold. Jarrett followed up by bashing a guitar over Angle's head and covering for a pinfall that Foley counted to win the match at 20 minutes and 7 seconds. The main event was for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in which the champion Samoa Joe defended against the challenger Sting. The duration of the encounter was 16 minutes and 54 seconds. The beginning of the match had Joe on the offensive, with Joe performing a dive between the ropes to hit Sting in the face with his forearm. The competitors then fought throughout the crowd for an extended period. At one point while the two were fighting on the arena steps, Joe jumped from a luxury box and kicked Sting down the stairs. Afterwards, Sting and Joe fought back towards the ring with each trading the offensive advantage. Back in the ring, Sting earned a near-fall after an aerial splash from the top of a turnbuckle. Joe placed Sting in an STF submission hold after a powerbomb next. Sting reached the ropes, causing the hold to be broken by the referee. Sting threw Joe into a ring corner and performed his signature Stinger Splash before lifting Joe up and slamming Joe neck-first onto the mat with Joe's signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe got up off the mat immediately and attacked Sting. He then slammed Sting head and back-first into the mat with Sting's trademark Scorpion Death Drop maneuver. Sting also got up immediately after the move. Later, Kevin Nash entered the arena and walked to the ringside area. Nash had reportedly left the company but his attendance backstage was leaked to various media outlets. As Joe was arguing with the referee, Sting retrieved a baseball bat that he had left at ringside. Nash pulled the bat from Sting's hands, not allowing him to use it in the match. Afterwards, Joe and Sting fought in the ring when Sting dodged a running Joe, causing him to almost collide with referee Earl Hebner who dodged as well. At this time, Nash hit Joe across the back with the baseball bat when Joe came in contact with the ring ropes. Sting followed by performing the Scorpion Death Drop on Joe and pinned him to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. The event came to a close as Sting celebrated in-front of the crowd. Reception There were several reported attendance figures for Bound for Glory IV, with the initial attendance figure being 5,000 people before being retracted and updated to a total of 5,500 people by The Wrestling Observer Newsletter. This was lower than the maximum seating capacity available at the Sears Centre of between 11,000 and 11,800 people for festival style events. However, the Bound for Glory IV setup caused the event to only hold a maximum capacity of 8,000 people. Of the 5,500 that attended the show, only 4,500 of them were paid tickets. Despite this, it was seen as one of the largest paid crowds in the company's history and one of the most responsive crowds the company has had as well. The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that 35,000 people bought the event. Chris and Bryan Sokol of the Canadian Online Explorer reviewed and rated the show on a scale out of 10, giving it a 7. This was the same rating given to the 2009 edition by Nick Tylwalk, but lower than the 7.5 out of 10 given to the 2007 edition by Chris Sokol. Compared to TNA's previous PPV event No Surrender, Bound for Glory was received better as No Surrender was given a 3 out of 10 by Jason Clevett. Meanwhile, Chris and Bryan Sokol gave TNA's next PPV event Turning Point a 7 out of 10. Rival World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) produced two PPV events in October that competed against Bound for Glory IV. The first was the No Mercy PPV event on October 5, while the second was the Cyber Sunday PPV event on October 26\\\\. No Mercy was reviewed by Chris and Bryan Sokol and given a 6 out of 10, lower than the Bound for Glory IV rating. Cyber Sunday was rated an 8 out of 10 by Andy McNamara, higher than the Bound for Glory rating. Compared to WWE's WrestleMania XXIV PPV event on March 30, Bound for Glory IV was outperformed as WrestleMania XXIV was given a 9 out of 10 by Dale Plummer. Chris and Bryan Sokol rated the matches on a scale out of 10, with the main event receiving a 7. The Jeff Jarrett versus Kurt Angle bout and the Four Way Tag Team Monster's Ball match were both given an 8 out of 10. The Three Way War between A.J. Styles, Booker T, and Christian Cage was given a 7, while the X Division Championship match got a 6 out of 10. In their review, they commented that the ending of the event was a \\"sloppy finish to a decent PPV\\". They felt the Jarrett versus Angle contest was a \\"great match with lots of close calls and near falls\\", while the Three Way War they considered was \\"pretty good\\". As for the Monster's Ball match, they said that it was \\"crazy\\", with \\"tons of brawling\\". The X Division Championship encounter was called a \\"good match\\" in their review. alt=Kurt Angle and Jeff Jarrett wrestling at Bound for Glory IV Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter reviewed the show. Keller rated the matches on a scale out of 5 stars, with the main event given a 3 1/4 stars and called a \\"fine match that fit its slot on the PPV well\\" but had a finish that he described as \\"horrible\\". He gave Jarrett versus Angle 3 1/2 stars with Keller commenting that it was a \\"good old-school match ... but a bit slow\\". The Three Way War received a 3 star rating, stating that there was \\"enough good\\" but overall it was \\"above-average.\\" The Monster's Ball match was given 3 1/4 stars in the review and called \\"an exciting match\\" with Keller explaining that there were \\"four stars worth of action, but it crossed into gratuitousness\\" and also criticized some awkward moments and the fire's danger. The X Division Championship contest got 2 1/4 stars with Keller commenting that it \\"started okay\\" with the middle being a \\"little too slow\\" and that the \\"build to the finish was solid\\" but the \\"actual pin was sloppy\\". James Caldwell, also of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter, posted a review of the show rating the matches on the same scale as Keller. The main event was given 3 1/2 stars with Caldwell commenting that it was a \\"really good main event match\\" but that the finishing sequence \\"killed the momentum\\". The Jarrett and Angle bout got a 4 star rating and called a \\"really nice match with a good story\\". Caldwell clarified that the \\"finish didn't hurt the drama\\". He also complimented Jarrett's \\"great physical condition in his first match back\\". The Three Way War received 3 stars with Caldwell saying it had \\"some really good moments\\". Caldwell called the Monster's Ball match a \\"heck of a stunt brawl\\" that \\"came off pretty well with tons of energy\\" before giving it 3 1/2 stars. He referred to the X Division Championship encounter as a \\"good singles match\\" and gave it 2 stars. Daniel Wilkenfeld, also of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter, posted a review of the telecast. Wilkenfeld gave some overall comments on the show, saying the \\"first half of the card dragged\\" but the \\"latter half picked up the pace a lot\\". Wilkenfeld compared the event against \\"normal TNA PPV standards\\" with Bound for Glory IV being a \\"pretty good outing\\", giving it either a \\"B+, or maybe even an A‚àí\\" as an average show but since it was Bound for Glory the bar was raised higher so he only gave it a C. He called Samoa Joe the \\"Star of the Night\\" for getting a \\"largely pro- Sting crowd behind his destructive ways\\". Wilkenfeld called the Jarrett and Angle bout as the possible \\"match of the night\\" in his review. He referred to the flaming table portion of the Monster's Ball match as being \\"an insane flaming table spot\\" in which he could not understand how those are done \\"without bad things happening\\". He was disappointed by the X Division Championship match, and said that it never got past its \\"competent\\" beginning, with its conclusion \\"both arbitrary and blown\\". Aftermath On-screen alt=A.J. Styles in wrestling gear standing in a wrestling ring Following Bound for Glory IV, TNA continued the rivalry between the veteran wrestlers and the younger wrestlers. At Turning Point on November 9, TNA held several matches connected to this overall narrative. Since Samoa Joe and Sting agreed on the stipulation that there would be no rematch between the two, Sting went on to feud with A.J. Styles while Joe fought Kevin Nash. On the October 23 episode of Impact!, the veterans in TNA formed the group The Main Event Mafia, consisting of Sting, Kurt Angle, Nash, Booker T, and Scott Steiner. Meanwhile, the younger wrestlers formed The TNA Front Line led by Joe and Styles. Heading into Turning Point, Styles and Sting argued over Sting assaulting Styles at Hard Justice. On the October 30 episode of Impact!, newly made co-owner of TNA Mick Foley advertised Sting defending the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Styles at Turning Point. Sting retained the title at the event. Sting and Styles fought again at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on December 7, this time in an Eight Man Tag Team Match pitting The Main Event Mafia (Sting, Nash, Steiner, and Booker T) against The TNA Front Line (Styles, Joe, Brother Devon, and Brother Ray) for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. The Main Event Mafia won the match, thus Sting retained the championship for a second time against Styles. Sting and Styles fought one last time for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but not for several months. They clashed one final time at the 2009 Bound for Glory event on October 18\\\\. At that event, Styles headed into the bout as the TNA World Heavyweight Champion. Styles defeated Sting to retain the championship at the show. The storyline behind Nash's betrayal began in December 2007. At the 2007 Turning Point event, Joe was scheduled to take part in a Six Man Tag Team match, partnering with Nash and Nash's longtime real-life friend Scott Hall to face The Angle Alliance (Angle, Styles, and Tomko). Hall missed the event citing \\"food poisoning\\", leaving Joe legitimately angered by the excuse, causing him to make an on-camera statement insulting Hall. Following the incident, TNA began a storyline in which Joe was unhappy with his position in the company for various reasons and had continuous conflicts with Nash. After time, Nash became Joe's on-screen mentor, which led to Joe defeating Angle on April 13 at TNA's Lockdown PPV event to become the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion. On the October 30 episode of Impact!, Foley announced that Joe would face Nash at Turning Point. Nash defeated Joe at the event. Joe and Nash fought again at Final Resolution when they competed on opposing teams in the Eight Man Tag Team match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, which Nash's team won. Nash and Joe did not have another match until April 19, 2009 at TNA's Lockdown PPV event, when Joe was a part of Team Jarrett (Jarrett, Styles, Daniels, and Joe) and Nash was a part of Team Angle (Angle, Steiner, Booker T, and Nash) in a Lethal Lockdown match. Team Jarrett won the encounter; Joe went on to defeat Nash on May 24 at TNA's Sacrifice PPV event afterwards. Another encounter connected to the narrative that was advertised for Turning Point was Kurt Angle versus Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match. After Angle lost to Jeff Jarrett at Bound for Glory IV, Angle challenged Jarrett to a rematch, which was refused on the October 16 episode of Impact!. To get Jarrett to accept his challenge, Angle assaulted several wrestlers in TNA. On the October 23 episode of Impact!, Angle challenged Jarrett to a rematch for the second time. Jarrett refused the offer for a second time, but recommended a casualty of Angle's attacks, Abyss, as Angle's opponent. On the October 30 episode of Impact!, a contest between Angle and Abyss ended in a disqualification after Angle struck Abyss with a steel chair. Following their encounter, a match was promoted pitting Angle against Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match at Turning Point. Angle won the bout at the show. On the October 23 episode of Impact!, Booker T introduced a new championship named the TNA Legends Championship and declared himself the inaugural champion. Afterwards, Christian Cage challenged Booker T to defend the championship against him at Turning Point. Booker T accepted after he added the stipulation that if Cage lost the encounter Cage would have to join The Main Event Mafia. Later on the October 30 episode of Impact!, the match was made official when it was promoted for the event. Booker T retained the championship at Turning Point, defeating Cage and causing him to join the veterans and The Main Event Mafia in the storyline. Off-screen A few wrestlers were injured at Bound for Glory IV. The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that Abyss suffered burns to his arms after going through a flaming table at the event. Jimmy Rave received a neck injury from being dropped on his head badly by Johnny Devine during the Steel Asylum. The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that almost all of the participants involved in the Four Way Tag Team Monster's Ball match at the show were furious over how Steve McMichael performed as the Special Guest Referee. Some of the reported issues were slow counting and being out of position, which several felt \\"screwed up the match.\\" McMichael was originally supposed to have served as a Special Ringside Enforcer, but TNA personnel did not want the role done twice in one night. The decision to change him to the Special Guest Referee was made the day of the show by Jeff Jarrett.

The system was called \\"conscript obligation\\" (). Prior to 18th century Russian tsars before Peter maintained professional hereditary musketeer corps (streltsy in Russian) that were highly unreliable and undisciplined. In times of war the armed forces were augmented by peasant levies. Peter I introduced a modern regular army built on the German model, but with a new aspect: officers were not necessarily drawn solely from the nobility, but included talented commoners. This new class of officers might eventually be given a noble title upon attaining a certain rank. Conscription of peasants and townspeople was based on settlement and district quotas. Initially these were based on the number of households, later on the population numbers.Jerome Blum (1971) \\"Lord and Peasant in Russia: From the Ninth to the Nineteenth Century\\", , pp. 465,466 18th century to Napoleonic Wars The term of service during the 18th century was for life. In 1793 it was reduced to 25 years. Individual conscripts were drawn from urban and rural males of Russian nationality who paid poll-tax (including serfs), upon reaching the age of twenty. Because of the large population pool available, exemptions were common with the decisions largely being left to the village elders of each community. The final stage in the selection process involved the drawing of names by lot, according to the actual requirements of the army in any given year. This might mean that virtually no recruits would be required in years where the Empire was at peace and the limited replacements required could be met through the voluntary re- enlistment of veterans nearing the end of their period of conscription. Alternatively, in the critical French invasion year of 1812 three separate levies were needed, calling up a total of fifteen males from every hundred available. 1825 to Milyutin reforms In 1825 the duration of active service remained at 25 years for line regiments, with shorter periods of 22 years for the Imperial Guard and 15 in support and technical corps. In 1834 it was reduced to 20 years plus 5 years in the reserve and in 1855 to 12 years plus 3 years of reserve commitment. Following the 1834 changes depot battalions were established in recruiting districts for each regiment to enable basic training for conscripts. Allocation to a particular corps was on the basis of build and appearance (regiments of the Imperial Guard), education (literate conscripts became clerks or went to the technical branches), and skills (lighter men with equine experience went to the cavalry). The great mass of conscripted recruits were allocated to the line infantry. At least in peacetime this system of arbitrary allocation was to continue until the end of the Russian Empire with no provision being made for individual preferences. After the Russian defeat in the Crimean War during the reign of Alexander II, the Minister of War Dmitry Milyutin introduced sweeping proposals for military reform, with draft provisions presented in 1862. As part of these reforms, on January 1, 1874 , a conscription statute was approved by the tsar making military service theoretically compulsory for all males at the age 20. The period of service was reduced to 6 years full-time plus 9 years in the reserve. This conscription measure created a large pool of military reserves ready to be mobilized in the event of war, while permitting a smaller active army during peacetime. Prior to the Milyutin reforms the Russian army had effectively been a long-service force with limited reserves, since many men who had completed their 25 years of service would not be physically fit for active service if recalled to the colours. The six years of service \\"with the colours\\" required of Russian conscripts after 1874 was modified by a general practice of allowing individuals to take extended leave for the last twenty-four months of their obligation for active duty. Once released from full-time service, a former conscript was still liable to be recalled to help bring a regular unit up to full strength in the event of general mobilization or to replace casualty losses. After six years with the reserve his commitment was reduced to service with a behind-the-lines garrison unit, unlikely to see actual battle. Families with only one son were exempted from conscription. Final years of the Empire Following the Russo-Japanese War major attempts were made at military reform, including the extension of the conscription system to enlarge the pool of trained reservists. The conscription system as evolved during 1910-14 set call-up liability at the age of 21 with a commitment for active and reserve service that lasted until 43. Service \\"with the colours\\" varied from three years for infantry and artillery, to four years for cavalry, engineers and support corps. The individual conscript would then pass into the \\"First Reserve\\" for seven years and the \\"Second Reserve\\" for eight years. As had been the case since the 18th century, the commitment for conscription fell primarily on subjects of Russian nationality. Muslims and Finns were exempted, although the former were required to pay a special tax and the latter were enlisted in a separate corps of Finnish regiments with no commitment to serve outside their homeland. About half of potential Russian conscripts were able to obtain exemption for a variety of personal reasons, although they might be required to serve with the militia upon the general mobilization of the regular army. A continuing weakness in the Russian system was a shortage of long-service volunteers to provide career NCOs. Cossacks served under a complex and semi-feudal conscription system of their own and \\"Alien\\" cavalry units were recruited as volunteers from Muslim tribal groups in the southern regions of the Russian Empire.

Bantu settlement The ancestors of the Lulua people and the Luba-Kasai, the two largest ethnic groups in the region, settled in the region at around 500 BC. European exploration Belgian rule Belgian rule in Kasai, post-Leopold, eventually saw the consolidation of the region as a single political unit. In 1919, Bas-Congo, Moyen-Congo, Kasa√Ø, Kwango and Sankuru districts (out of 22 districts created in the Belgian Congo) were merged into Congo Kasai, one of four provinces created that year. In 1933 Kasa√Ø and Sankuru (the two eastern districts of the former vice government general of Congo-Kasa√Ø) and parts of the districts of L√©opold II (in Equateur) and Lomami (in Katanga) were separated to form the new Congolese province of Lusambo (after 1947, Kasai); in turn, Bas-Congo, Kwango, L√©opoldville and the major part of Lake L√©opold II became the new province of L√©opoldville. In 1957, the capital of Kasai was moved from Lusambo to Luluabourg. End of Belgian rule In 1960, the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared independence from Belgium. However, it was beset by a number of secessions and bitter civil war. Secession of South Kasai The South Kasai region sought independence in similar circumstances to neighboring Katanga during the Congo Crisis. Ethnic conflicts and political tensions between leaders of the central government and local leaders plagued the diamond-rich region. On 14 June 1960, days before the colony was to become independent, officials declared the independence of Kasai (not of Congo) and proclaimed the Federal State of South Kasai. On 8 August 1960, the autonomous Mining State of South Kasai was proclaimed with its capital at Bakwanga. Albert Kalonji was named president of South Kasai and Joseph Ngalula was appointed head of government. Lumumba was determined to quickly subdue the renegade provinces of Kasai and Katanga. Dissatisfied with the UN, Lumumba followed through on his threat to request military assistance from the Soviet Union, who responded with an airlift of Congolese troops to invade Kasai. A bloody campaign ensued causing the deaths of hundreds of Baluba tribesmen and the flight of a quarter of a million refugees. Lumumba's decision to accept Soviet help angered the US, who via the CIA increasingly supported Mobutu and Kasa-Vubu. Congolese forces re-conquer South Kasai On December 30, 1961, after a four-month military campaign, troops of the Congolese central government re-conquered South Kasai and arrested Kalonji, thus ending the South Kasai secession. Post civil war Under the subsequent regime of Joseph Mobutu (Mobutu Sese Seko), the former South Kasai was divided to discourage separatist sentiment or activity; most of the territory was allocated to Kasai-Oriental, while the rest of the historic Kasai region was renamed Kasai-Occidental. Post Mobutu In 2006, the new Constitution re- divided the region into five new provinces: * Kasai oriental * Lomami * Sankuru * Kasai * Lulua In 2007, two cases of the Ebola haemorrhagic fever were announced in the region.

For example, private railways within a steel works are private and not available to outsiders. In the hypothetical case of the steelworks having a port or a railway to a distant mine, outsiders might want access to save having to incur a possibly large cost of building their own facility.  Marconi and radio communication  The Marconi Company was a pioneer of long distance radio communication, which was particularly useful for ships at sea. Marconi was very protective about its costly infrastructure and refused‚Äîexcept for emergencies‚Äîto allow other radio companies to share its infrastructure. Even if the message sender was royalty, as in the Deutschland incident of 1902, they continued to refuse access. Since radio communication was so new, it preceded laws, regulations and licences, which might otherwise impose conditions to open infrastructure to other players.  Pilbara railways  In the northwest of Western Australia, two large mining companies operate their own private railway networks to bring iron ore from mines to the port. In 1999 North Limited made an application to access Rio Tinto's Pilbara system, but Rio's takeover of North Limited meant that application was never fully tested. In 2004 Fortescue Metals Group launched a bid to have the Mt Newman line owned by BHP Billiton \\"declared\\" for third party access. The owner of the line claimed that they formed an integral part of the production process, and so should not be subject to completion requirements. When these mines started in the 1960s, state laws required the miners to make their infrastructure available to other players, but no application had been made.The Australian 11 June 2008, p31 In the same region, the Fortescue Metals Group railway has been set up for open access for a fee. In June 2008 the Federal Government advisory body, the National Competition Council, recommended that BHP Billiton's Goldsworthy railway and Rio Tinto's Robe River and Hamersley lines should be declared open access. Treasurer Wayne Swan was given 60 days to make a final decision based on this recommendation. On October 27 the three lines were 'declared' with open access to apply from November 20, 2008. This will apply for 20 years under the National Access Regime within the Trade Practices Act 1974. The declaration does not give a right of access, but provides a third party with recourse if access terms cannot be negotiated with the infrastructure owner.  Concerns  A player seeking access to infrastructure would expect to pay several fees of a capital and operating kind. Hopefully the cost of this is less than having to build separate infrastructure. It is in the public interest that access disputes be resolved in an efficient way, so that for example, profits are maximised and therefore income tax on those profits is also maximised. The potential for monopoly infrastructure to charge high fees and provide poor service has long been recognised. Monopolies are often inevitable because of high capital costs, with governments often imposing conditions, in exchange for approval of the project and for the granting of useful powers such as land resumption. Thus a canal might have its rates regulated, and be forbidden to operate canal boats on its own waters.  Trackage rights  Where there are many separate railways and one railway wishes to run trains off their own tracks onto the tracks of another, they may seek trackage rights from the other railway(s). This can be done by voluntary agreement, or by compulsory order of a regulator. In time of flood and accident which puts a line out of order, compulsory trackage rights may be ordered in the public interest to keep traffic flowing, assuming that alternative routes exist.  Joint Venture  One of the problems faced by Open Access is what is a fair price. Consider the Iron Ore minnow BC Iron which seeks access to the Forstescue railway. (Fortescue has declared itself to be an open access operator). BC Iron and Fortescue agreed to set up a joint venture to operate both the BCI mine and the railway connection to the port. As the larger player, Fortescue will run the show. The joint venture gives BC Iron inside information as to how much the railway and port will cost, while Fortescue gains inside information about the mine.  Geraldton  In 2010, Mt Gibson Mining will be spending $20m to upgrade the ore unloaded at Geraldton. The facility will be open to other users who will pay a toll for such usage. The Oakajee port and railway network is also to be open access.  Queensland  In 2011, GVK has offer to make its proposed railway from the Galilee Basin to Abbot Point as open access to other players.The Australian 21 September 2011 p39  Telecommunications  In the telecommunications industry, open access to existing infrastructure, in the form of local loop unbundling, duct sharing, utility pole sharing, and fiber unbundling, is one proposed solution to the middle mile problem.

First raised in 1794, it participated in the Second Boer War and World War I as horsed cavalry before being converted to an anti-tank regiment of the Royal Artillery for service in World War II. In 1956 it was amalgamated with the Warwickshire Yeomanry to form the Queen's Own Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry. The lineage is maintained by B (Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry) Squadron, part of The Royal Yeomanry. History Formation and early history Worcestershire Yeomanry 1890s The Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars were formed in 1794, as the Worcestershire Yeomanry, when King George III was on the throne, William Pitt the Younger was the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and across the English Channel, Britain was faced by a French nation that had recently guillotined its King and possessed a revolutionary army numbering half a million men. The Prime Minister proposed that the counties form a force of Volunteer Yeomanry Cavalry, which could be called on by the King to defend the country against invasion or by the Lord Lieutenant to subdue any civil disorder within the country. Worcestershire responded quickly - the first troop paraded in front of the Unicorn Inn in Worcester on 25 October 1794 under the command of Captain John Somers-Cocks and Lieutenant Thomas Spooner. With the threat of a French invasion having receded after the signing of the Peace of Amiens in 1802, the King commended the Worcestershire Yeomanry for their \\"honourable distinction in forming an essential part of the defence of the country against a foreign enemy in circumstances of extraordinary emergency\\". Edwin Hughes served as Sergeant-Instructor with the Worcestershire Yeomanry starting from the day after his discharge from the 13th Hussars until his discharge for 'old age' on 5 January 1886. Edwin Hughes was the oldest survivor of the Charge of the Light Brigade. The regiment was disbanded in 1827 but reformed in 1833. In 1837, Queen Victoria altered the title of the regiment which was for the future to bear the designation of the Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars. Second Boer War In 1899, they were called for service in the Imperial Yeomanry, for the Boer War. The War Office was not prepared for the Boer offensive and sent only 10,000 Indian troops, under command of Lord Methuen, to face some 70,000 Boers. After an initial success the British found themselves in trouble owing to lack of cavalry. The result was the English Yeomanry Regiments were called upon and their response was immediate. Lord Windsor, the Commanding Officer asked for volunteers for a newly formed Imperial Yeomanry Cavalry and was able to select 129 men from the 3,021 men who offered their services. The Worcestershire contingent formed the 6th Squadron of the 5th Regiment of the Imperial Yeomanry Cavalry under the command of Colonel Meyrick. The squadron's orders were to protect the railways, pacify the local Boer farmers and to capture the Boer forces their supplies, arms and equipment. The Regiment was armed with the Martini‚ÄìHenry carbine and 2 lb and 3 lb guns which were, in fact, the private property of Lord Plymouth and paid for out of private funds. The Countess of Dudley, whose husband had been Colonel Commander of the Worcestershire Yeomanry, presented each yeoman with a pear blossom, the emblem of Worcestershire, worked in silk, to wear in their hat as a reminder of where they were from. When they returned in 1903 the Countess presented the regiment with a sprig of pear blossom made by Faberg√©, in gold, diamond, rock crystal, and jade, which the unit still bring out on dinner nights. The Second Boer War ended in June 1902 and the Regiment returned to a home having lost 16 NCOs killed in action and 20 wounded. The regiment was based at Silver Street in Worcester at this time (since demolished). First World War Ombersley: headstone for A.G. Pound, Worcestershire Yeomanry In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9), which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split in August and September 1914 into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments. = 1/1st Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars= The Earl of Dudley, who took command of the Worcestershire Yeomanry Cavalry in November 1913, was already convinced that another European war was approaching. He appointed a permanent staff of instructors who trained the Regiment in musketry. War was declared in August 1914 and the Worcestershires formed part of the 1st South Midland Mounted Brigade commanded by Brigadier E.A. Wiggin.Worcestershire Yeomanry at Log, Long Trail. The Brigade was ordered to Egypt and was based in Chatby Camp, close to Alexandria, by April 1915. In August the Brigade were informed they were to fight as infantry, and were sent to Suvla Bay, and took part in the Gallipoli campaign. The Regiment were in support of the Anzacs and other British soldiers, in an attempt to break through the Turkish defences. These Turkish defences on the hills overlooking the beaches proved too strong and Gallipoli was evacuated in January 1916. The Regiment was sent to Egypt, where their casualties were replaced by fresh troops from England and the Regiment was sent to protect the eastern side of the Suez Canal. The Regiment dug wells and sent out patrols for reconnaissance to establish the location of the Turkish attack, the Regiment being responsible for patrolling the whole of the Qatia water area. The small isolated garrison at Oghratine had been ordered to protect a party of engineers on a well-digging expedition, when at dawn on 23 April 1916, 3,000 Turkish troops, including a machine gun battery of 12 guns, attacked. The defending troops repulsed the first attack but were forced back by the weight of the onslaught. The defenders' only machine gun was put out of action early in the attack and all the gunners were killed or wounded. The victorious Turkish troops then advanced to reinforce the attack taking place against the small garrison at Qatia. Qatia fell to the Turkish forces with the loss of all of the Yeomanry's officers except a Major W.H. Wiggin who was wounded and managed to withdraw with about half the squadron. Anzac troops, who occupied both Qatia and Oghradine four days later, testified to the ferocity of the battle and paid tribute to the valour and tenacity of the defenders. In these actions, 9 officers and 102 NCOs and men of the Regiment were killed and many other wounded. A composite regiment, including the Worcestershire Yeomanry, was formed in August 1916 and together with Anzac regiments were tasked to force back some 48,000 Turks from Romani, a strategically important and fortified watering hole which was identified as the Turkish base for a major attack on the Suez Canal. After a fierce battle, the Turkish forces were forced to retreat and large numbers of guns were captured. The Turkish army regrouped at Gaza and made a stand which brought the British advance to a halt until the arrival of General Edmund Allenby, who reorganised the army and allowed them to conduct operations towards the Turkish positions at Beersheba. The resulting operation took the Turkish forces by surprise and they were forced to withdraw. In the pursuit that followed the Worcestershire Yeomanry with the Warwickshire Yeomanry took part in the last cavalry charge on guns in British Military history, the Charge at Huj. Under Colonel Hugh Cheape the cavalry charged a group of Turkish guns at a place called Huj in November 1917. This action, in defence of the beleaguered 60th London Division, who were pinned down by Turkish fire, succeeded forcing them to withdraw and resulted in the capture of the guns. Yeomanry losses were heavy. Two out of nine officers were killed and four wounded and of 96 NCOs and men 17 were killed and 35 wounded. = 2/1st Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars= The 2nd Line regiment was formed at Worcester in September 1914. In April 1915 it joined the 2/1st South Midland Mounted Brigade at Cirencester and in June moved to King's Lynn where the brigade joined the 2/2nd Mounted Division. In July 1915, the regiment was at Holkham Hall. On 31 March 1916, the remaining Mounted Brigades were ordered to be numbered in a single sequence; the brigade was numbered as 10th Mounted Brigade and the division as 3rd Mounted Division. In July 1916, the regiment was converted to a cyclist unit in 8th Cyclist Brigade, 2nd Cyclist Division and was stationed at Tunbridge Wells. In November 1916, the division was broken up and regiment was merged with the 2/1st Royal Gloucestershire Hussars to form 12th (Gloucestershire and Worcestershire) Yeomanry Cyclist Regiment in 4th Cyclist Brigade at Ipswich. In March 1917, it resumed its identity as 2/1st Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars. In April 1917, it moved to Wivenhoe, by November at Frinton and then to Manningtree. About April 1918 the regiment moved to Ireland and was stationed at Dublin where it remained, still in 4th Cyclist Brigade, until the end of the war. = 3/1st Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars= The 3rd Line regiment was formed in 1915; in the summer it was affiliated to a Reserve Cavalry Regiment at Tidworth. In the summer of 1916 it was affiliated to the 4th Reserve Cavalry Regiment, still at Tidworth. Early in 1917, it was absorbed into the 5th Reserve Cavalry Regiment, also at Tidworth. Between the Wars The Regiment returned from Palestine in 1919, under strength, but were quickly reformed and brought up to strength. It had become clear during the war that cavalry was obsolete and, in 1922, it was announced that the Worcestershires were to serve as two horsed batteries in the Royal Field Artillery (RFA): 397 at Worcester and 398 at King's Heath, Birmingham. Together with 399 and 400 batteries from the Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars they formed 100th (Worcestershire and Oxfordshire Yeomanry) Brigade, RFA. The horses were replaced by artillery tractors in 1922. In 1924 the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery (RA), and the unit was redesignated as an 'Army Field Brigade, RA', serving as 'Army Troops' in 48th (South Midland) Divisional Area.Litchfield, p. 202.Litchfield, pp. 247‚Äì8.Titles and Designations, 1927. As the British Army rearmed in the years before World War II, the 100th Field Brigade was converted on 28 November 1938 to the anti-tank role as 53rd (Worcestershire and Oxfordshire Yeomanry) Anti- Tank Regiment, RA (RA 'brigades' being redesignated 'regiments' at this time). The two QOWH batteries were renumbered as 209 (at Kidderminster) and 210 (at Kng's Heath) (Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars Yeomanry) A/T Btys. Its 18-pounders were replaced with 2-pounders. After the Munich Crisis the TA was doubled in size, and the 53rd A/T Rgt was split in February 1939, the Worcester Yeomanry batteries remaining with the 53rd and expanding to four (209 at Kidderminser, 210 and 211 at King's Heath and 212 at Bewdley), and the QOOH batteries forming a new 63rd A/T Rgt. Both were officially titled 'Worcestershire and Oxfordshire Yeomanry', taking no account of the actual split. Second World War =Battle of France= The Regiment was part of the 48th (South Midland) Infantry DivisionJoslen, p. 77. and went with the division in January 1940 to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the border between France and Belgium. On 10 May 1940, the German Army's attack started and the BEF moved forwards across the Belgian frontier to take position on the River Dyle. Lord Gort, commanding the entire BEF, was aware of the possibility of a northward retreat to the coast and used the 48th Division to cover the 28 miles of the La Bassee Canal. Their purpose was to protect the western flank of the BEF by holding strongpoints such as canal crossings. Large enemy losses were inflicted by the 210 Battery together with troops of the 211 in support of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment (of 144th Infantry Brigade) who were holding the town of Wormhoudt. These same troops were later involved in the Wormhoudt massacre. Orders were received from Brigade to destroy their guns and vehicles and proceed to Dunkirk. Near Oost- Cappell the 212 Battery defended the crossroads against German tanks, some of which were destroyed, until being forced to withdraw after disabling their guns and vehicles. Each battery had been ordered to escape to Dunkirk, but only five officers and 284 men of the Regiment were evacuated from the beaches of Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo. The Regiment had, however, gained the distinction of having destroyed more enemy tanks than any other anti-tank Regiment of the BEF. Men of 53rd Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery, manhandle a 2 Pounder Anti-Tank gun across a stream near Thirsk in Yorkshire, 26 May 1942. (IWM H20128) In October 1941 the regiment was transferred to 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division, which was being converted into an armoured division. 42nd Armoured Division was broken up in October 1943, when the regiment moved to 6th Airborne Division, at first as an A/T regiment, then from 3 November as a light field regiment designated 53rd (Worcestershire Yeomanry) Air Landing Light Regiment, RA,Joslen, pp. 29, 68, 106, 222. and was now part of the British Army's airborne forces. =D-Day= Owing to a shortage of gliders, only 211 Battery participated in the British airborne assault on D-Day, 6 June 1944. Together with the 6th Airborne Division, they were tasked to seize and hold the high wooded area behind the city of Caen, which would see very heavy fighting during the Battle for Caen in the weeks to come, on the eastern flank of the Normandy bridgehead. 211 Battery landed near Caen in 27 gliders on 6 June. The Regiment's other Batteries, 210 and 212, were sent to Normandy on , which had been pressed into service as a troopship. They landed by sea at Luc-sur-Mer, on 14 June and joined up with 211 the following day; the complete Regiment going into action on 15 June. The Regiment now manned a series of Forward Observation Posts providing information for the Parachute and Commando Brigades against German mortar strongpoints. By 16 August, reports were received that the Germans were pulling out eastwards. Major-General Richard Nelson Gale, General Officer Commanding the 6th Airborne Division, received orders that his command, together with the Regiment, was to maintain pressure on the retreating Germans on the coastal route towards the Seine in Operation Paddle. Progress was slow but the Regiment reached Honfleur on 27 August. They then returned to England to rest and reform for future airborne operations with the rest of the 6th Airborne Division. On 20 December 1944, the Regiment received orders to embark for France again and by 26 December they were in action near Dinant in support of the 6th Airlanding Brigade, as the Americans and British defended against the German offensive in the Ardennes. The Regiment's 210 Battery claimed to be the first to land shells over the frontier on German soil. =Operation Varsity= In March 1945, the plan for Operation Varsity was to drop two Airborne divisions (the British 6th and US 17th), including the Regiment, behind enemy lines north of Wesel, isolate the industrial Ruhr and disrupt the German rear defences. On 24 March, 78 gliders set off from England for a successful attack that established bridgeheads on the eastern bank of the Rhine. The first guns were in action within 10 minutes of the gliders landing. By the evening, all of the divisions' objectives had been taken but 2 Battery Commanders and 20 Other Ranks had been killed, with 8 officers and 59 men missing or prisoners of war. The advance continued and six weeks later they reached the Baltic coast. The Regiment had fought in and captured the towns of Greven, Lengerich, Osnabr√ºck, Minden and Lahder. Heavy German resistance was encountered near Celle on 15 April, when German self-propelled guns caused problems for 6th Airborne until they were outflanked after heavy shelling by the Regiment. The advance of the Regiment met with the Russian Army westward advance on 30 April, on the Baltic Coast at Wismar. Palestine The Regiment had returned to England by 23 May and was then ordered in September 1945 to Palestine. Its task was to help establish and maintain security in the Jewish state against Arab hostility and internal Jewish battles for power. The Regiment retrained as infantry to act as a police force, controlling and searching traffic along the north to south roads into Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Jaffa. Their largest operation was to search Tel Aviv in three days, arresting men suspected of subversive activities and discovering hidden dumps of arms. Postwar The Regiment was to change its title to the 33rd Airborne Light Regiment (Worcestershire Yeomanry), RA, just prior to the Regiment's posting in January 1948 to Schleswig-Holstein in Germany. However the Worcestershire Yeomanry had already been reborn in 1947 in Worcestershire as the 300th (Worcestershire Yeomanry) Anti-tank Regiment, RA.289‚Äì322 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards. It was equipped with six-pounder anti-tank guns and later 17-pounder self-propelled guns. In 1950 the Regiment became cavalry again as The Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars, equipped with armoured cars in the Royal Armoured Corps. Early in 1956, the Government announced its intention to reduce the size of the T.A. due to the high cost. In November 1956, it was announced that the Warwickshire Yeomanry and The Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars were to be amalgamated. The new Regiment became the Queen's Own Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry in 1957. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, agreed to be Honorary Colonel of the Regiment, the only Regiment in the army to have that singular honour. The Regiment continued as an Armoured Regiment with Comet tanks until 1962 when it became an Armoured Car Reconnaissance Regiment. In 1966, it became a light Reconnaissance Regiment equipped with Daimler Dingo Scout cars. In 1969, the volunteer Territorial Army was dramatically reduced by the Labour Government and except for one Yeomanry Regiment all the others were disbanded but permitted to retain a small cadre of five members for possible expansion in later years. In addition, the Regiment was invited to form 67 (Queen's Own Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry) Signal Squadron at Stratford-on-Avon and Stourbridge with a Royal Signals role. This Squadron was raised from former members of the Queen's Own Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry. In 1971, with a change of government, each Yeomanry cadre was authorised to expand to Squadron strength (120 men). The three squadrons raised from the cadres of the Queen's Own Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry, the Staffordshire Yeomanry and the Shropshire Yeomanry were formed into a new Regiment called \\"The Queen's Own Mercian Yeomanry\\" with a reconnaissance role. With the defence cuts of 1992, The Queen's Own Mercian Yeomanry were amalgamated with The Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry to form The Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry with H.M. The Queen as its Colonel in Chief. It had a medium reconnaissance role and was equipped with Land Rovers. In July 1999, A (Queen's Own Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry) Squadron amalgamated with B (Staffordshire Yeomanry) Squadron of the same regiment, to form A (Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire) Squadron, The Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry at Dudley. In October 2006, the Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry became a single cap badge regiment, when the individual cap badges of each squadron were replaced by the newly designed RMLY cap badge. This incorporated the Mercian Eagle from the Queen's Own Mercian Yeomanry with the Red Rose from the Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry. It served in the armoured replacement role, providing replacement tank crews for regular armoured regiments. This was also the point at which H-Det (Hereford) joined the regiment, to provide a Recce troop. In July 2013, it was announced that the Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry would be restructured under the Army 2020 plan. The squadron, as B (Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry), resubordinated to The Royal Yeomanry.

Uniforms Following its formation in 1794 the \\"Worcestershire Troop of Gentlemen and Yeomen\\" wore red jackets faced in dark blue and silver, with white or buff breeches. The headdress was the Tarleton helmet worn by the regular light cavalry regiments. When re-raised in 1831 the Worcestershire Yeomanry adopted a red and white Light Dragoon dress, complete with plumed shako and buff facings. From 1850 to 1870 a Heavy Dragoon style helmet was worn, retaining the white plume of the earlier period. In 1871 a dark blue hussar uniform heavily embroidered in silver (for officers) or white (for other ranks) braiding, replaced the scarlet dragoon style (se photograph above). Fur busbies closely resembling those of the regular hussars were worn with red plumes and bags. Plainer blue undress uniforms were worn for training and ordinary duties by all ranks. For reasons of economy and simplification, a khaki \\"lancer\\" style uniform was introduced in 1902-03 for the regiment, worn with scarlet facings for both full dress and service dress. Influenced by Boer War experience, a wide brimmed slouch hat with scarlet \\"page\\" band and plume was also worn. This attempt at modernisation proved unpopular with serving yeomen and by 1908 the dark blue, silver or white full dress had been restored to the regiment. The plain (without facings) khaki service dress of the regular cavalry was worn from 1907 onwards, replacing the colourful full dress for nearly all occasions after 1914. While battle dress or other standard British Army uniforms were worn after 1938, features such as the by now historic blue and scarlet survived in items such as the field service caps of World War II (see lede illustration above).

This is based on strategies, doctrines and different policies that military forces adhere to. The nature of high mobility of military operations and their logistics support requires wide use with high speed capacities of voice, data and image communications, etc. Control, surveillance, reconnaissance and reporting systems play a vital role in the command and control system. Many of these requirements can be only met with the use of radio systems. The equipment of military communications adds and multiplies the power of forces. That is why the use of radio frequencies‚Äô spectrum is evaluated as one of the preliminary conditions for successful military operations. Need for access Despite the continuous reduction of forces, especially after the 1990s, it is seen that the military inquiries for access to radio spectrum have not decreased. This is because of the high mobility of the joint forces together with the quick reaction, increased number of missions, etc., which need more exact and timely information in all the defined regions and those unpredicted as well. Also, the equipment of military forces‚Äô systems work in different bands and with several frequencies at the same time. As long as the electromagnetic spectrum is evaluated as an element of the asset list and the operational electronic architecture that today‚Äôs and future forces should have, the military forces make all the efforts to get all the necessary bands of the spectrum. However, the military forces, in their activities to manage the frequencies fight with different challenges. The technology is running fast and has brought an extended variety of user services. The success of certain applications (mobile radio-telephony, equipment with low power, digital media, various military systems, etc.) naturally has caused an increase in the needs for frequencies from the civilian and military sectors. This has often brought civil administration to have tendencies to decrease the amount of frequencies in the interest of military forces. Spectrum management Spectrum management is complex and difficult. The terminology, legal and technical considerations, national, regional and international complex regulations and bilateral and multilateral agreements can confuse those less educated in the effort. The forces in operations often do not see the incompatibilities and interferences between systems in their own communication services and to the other systems. All of these dictate the need for specialized personnel to ensure relevant recommendations for the commanders and staffs in all the levels and to manage the spectrum. The effective continuous training of frequency administrators is an important factor in the improvement of frequency management. Fulfillment Based on the priority and the abilities of national security structures, comes the enforcement for the immediate and maximum fulfillment of their inquiries for electromagnetic spectrum. But, the civil administrations that manage the frequencies often do not understand and do not harmonize the spectrum requests in the benefit of national security. The developments in the national security structures do not get followed and do not get put into full consideration by them. So the military forces should be actively engaged for the definition of a clear and sole objective for the needs of spectrum in the internal and international context and also in the priority treatment in the discussions for spectrum definition. The fact of decreasing the military forces does not mean that their available spectrum should be decreased as well. The variety of operations (combat, non-combat and peace support) of military forces has increased and they usually use the frequencies based on the activities and not on the number of forces. The military equipment is designed to work using the entire traditional and harmonized military spectrum. Also, the support with frequencies is mandatory, to fulfill all the acquisition and procurement procedures. Standards An essential aspect in the management of frequencies is the orientation towards policies, agreements, and NATO procedures and standards. All of these should have the necessary reflection in those of military forces of one country, member or partner. This is a necessity and needs to achieve among others the interoperability between communication and information systems. The frequency management in military forces has a dynamic nature. It is related to adjustment and implementation of time concepts for the spectrum, taking into consideration planning, allocation, and spectrum usage in accordance with systems characteristics currently available and those of the future. This implies the flexibility in the protection of frequencies that are approved in national plans of frequencies, available for military forces. Although, it looks for a time to time evaluation of the current and future needs for spectrum aiming at more exact redefinitions of spectrum resources and more effective ways of spectrum division with other non-governmental users. Levels of command and control The authorities of different levels of command and control have the responsibility to ensure the full support of needs with spectrum for their structures. They always need and look for more continuous support with equipment which functions with radio frequencies. But, often they do not conceive correctly and do not have the necessary knowledge for access in the necessary frequency spectrum for military tasks. That is why the specialized frequency management structures have the responsibility of developing the full necessary administrative, planning and technical activities for frequencies. Prevention of interference To ensure a better and interference-free usage by other users, military forces, through their corresponding structures, take care for the monitoring of the frequency bands defined for them, cooperating and exchanging data with other governmental institutions authorized for spectrum management and other non-governmental users, to identify and detect unauthorized transmissions and illegal interferences. Spectrum monitoring requires expensive equipment and qualified personnel. Combined and joint operations Combined and joint operations are still a major challenge for frequency managers. The cooperation of two or more forces together, with different training and organization and without appropriate frequency planning, brings failure of command, control, and communications. The realizations of combined and joint operations, in alliance or coalitions, are closely connected to communications and information systems. Frequency management is evaluated as one of the main points for communications planning. In a coalition force, where there are a huge number of countries and military forces, if there is not correct management and coordination of spectrum bands what is colloquially called ‚Äúfrequency fratricide‚Äù will happen. To allocate frequencies in such an operation is very difficult. The spectrum usage in these operations has more than ever showed the need for coordination between forces of different countries and with the country where they operate, rationality, standardization, and interoperability, in accordance with deployment sites, regions and national and international regulations. Computer software applications Effective frequency management is closely tied with computer software applications. Through these applications, the optimal administration and coordination of frequencies and fulfillment of inquiries is ensured in every situation. Such applications support centralized and decentralized management of frequencies. They provide the planning and coordination of frequencies throughout the defined bands and their effective usage. Of course, such applications have financial costs and require time for the preliminary preparation and the final implementation. Policies, guides, procedures The normal frequency management in military forces is based on policies, guides, procedures, organizational and technical manuals. The preparation, their harmonization with international, regional and national regulations and adherence to technological developments is a continuous task that requires time to be realized from proper military structures. Technical capabilities A fundamental problem in frequency allocation is the existence of technical, geographical and operational factors, which restrict frequency usage of military forces. Frequency managers have to take into consideration technical capabilities and the equipment limit for functioning of the systems in accordance with operational requirements. In case of overloaded frequency bands, the military forces are obliged to foresee some interference and to accept some damage in the normal operation of their communications systems.

History In 1936, the first Sisters of the Good Samaritan arrived in Townsville to run the Saint Margaret Mary's Primary school. Bishop McGuire had purchased ‚ÄòWoodlands‚Äô, in Hyde Park from the Cummins family so that it could be used as a convent, which the Sisters named Saint Philomena's. In 1954, Bishop of Townsville, H.E. Ryan laid the foundation stone for St Margaret Mary's church and in 1956 the present Church was opened on the current site of the college. Saint Margaret Mary's College was officially opened on 22 February 1963 by the then Bishop of Townsville, H.E. Ryan. The school consisted of four classrooms, one office, staffroom, tuckshop, cloakroom and a ‚Äòmodern‚Äô science lecture room. Fifty students were enrolled, although the school had capacity for 200 girls. The school was operated by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan and the first Principal was Mary de Lourdes. The parish priest at the time, Monsignor Vandeluer, was the driving force behind the establishment of the College. The first lay Principal was Mike Byrne who was appointed in 1982. Currently Kathy Park is the principal of St Margaret Mary's College as of 2012 taking over for Peter Griffin who was principal in 2010‚Äì2011. Over the years the College has shaped its curriculum to reflect current educational trends and best practice. In 1997, Vocational, Education and Training (VET) subjects were introduced. Campus Saint Margaret Mary's College has seen a number of major projects that include: a multipurpose sports facility, extension to library and staffroom, a textiles room, a new chapel and tuckshop as well as renovations to the kitchen, library, administration block and laboratories. In 2005 two new computer rooms and class rooms were built and refurbishment commenced to create four state of the art Science rooms and a Graphics room. This refurbishment has since been completed and is now currently enjoyed by the 600+ students of the college. Currently the school is undergoing extensions to accommodate year 7's. The new buildings are a new administration block, dance room, art room etc. References Category:Educational institutions established in 1963 Category:Girls' schools in Queensland Category:Private schools in Queensland Category:High schools in Queensland Category:Schools in Townsville Category:1963 establishments in Australia Category:Alliance of Girls' Schools Australasia ","title":"St Margaret Mary's College"},{"id":"17650191","text":"The Embassy of Senegal in Washington, D.C.

Most of this trade is in barter conducted by ethnic Kyrgyz or Kazakhs who are Chinese citizens. The Kyrgyzstani government had expressed alarm over the numbers of Chinese who were moving into Naryn and other parts of Kyrgyzstan, but no preventive measures had been taken as of 1996.Martha Brill Olcott. \\"Central Asian Neighbors\\".

Migration Chinese border crossing at the Torugart Pass on the road between Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) and Kashgar (Xinjiang) Relations between the two nations are hindered by the fact, that China does not want the independence of Kyrgyzstan, a Turkic state, to encourage Turkic inhabitants of China's Xinjiang province, to pursue their own independence. There is some anti-Uygur sentiment in Kyrgyzstan. Daniar Usenov, who became the Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan in 2009, received accolades from multiple Kyrgyzstan newspapers by articulating the fear in 1999 that Kyrgyzstan would become \\"Uygurstan\\" through an alleged Chinese plot of miscegenation. Kyrgyzstan refused to permit the formation of an Uygur party. Trade Inside Bishkek's gigantic Dordoy Bazaar, filled primarily with Chinese products In the 1990s, trade with China grew enormously. Particularly important is the re-export of Chinese consumer goods to the neighboring Uzbekistan (mostly via Karasuu Bazar at Kara-Suu, Osh Province) and to Kazakhstan and Russia (mostly via Dordoy Bazaar in Bishkek).Sebastien Peyrouse, Economic Aspects of China-Central Asia Rapprochment . Central Asia - Caucasus Institute, Silk Road Studies Program. 2007. p.18. Due to its linguistic and cultural affinity with the Chinese (particularly, Hui) people, Kyrgyzstan's small Dungan community plays a significant role in the trade. In some political quarters, the prospect of Chinese domination stimulated nostalgia for the days of Moscow's control. As of 2019, China is one of the main trade and economic partners of Kyrgyzstan. China is also the main bilateral creditor of Kyrgyzstan.

Territorial claims  China has claimed large tracts of Kyrgyzstan territory, encompassing almost the whole of the country. As per Chinese historians, in the second half of the 19th century, China's Qing dynasty was forced to enter into a number of unequal treaties where Kyrgyz lands, particularly the North Kyrgyz lands were ceded to the Russian Empire in 1863. In May 2020, Chinese websites Tuotiao.com claimed that Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan were part of China and that \\"under the Khan dynasty, 510,000 square kilometre of Kyrgystan, which means the entire country was part of Chinese lands but the Russian empire took over the territory.\\" Cooperation Recent events in Kyrgyzstan have been of great concern to China, not only because of the issue over the Uygurs, but also due to problems with narcotic trafficking.China, US, Russia eye Bishkek During the 2005 Tulip Revolution China considered developments in Kyrgyzstan so important that they raised the possibility of deploying combat forces. In 2010 a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China stated that \\"we are deeply concerned over the developments of ISI Clandestine Operations in Kyrgyzstan and hope to see early restoration of order and stability in the country and that relevant issues can be settled through the legal means.\\" Kyrgyzstan and China have concluded joint military exercises several times.

Uzbekistan dominates southern Kyrgyzstan both economically and politically, based on the large Uzbek population in that region of Kyrgyzstan and on economic and geographic conditions.Martha Brill Olcott. \\"Central Asian Neighbors\\". Kyrgyzstan: a country study (Glenn E. Curtis, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (March 1996). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Much of Kyrgyzstan depends entirely on Uzbekistan for natural gas; on several occasions, Uzbekistan president Islam Karimov has achieved political ends by shutting pipelines or by adjusting terms of delivery. In a number of television appearances broadcast in the Osh and Jalal-Abad provinces of Kyrgyzstan, Karimov has addressed Akayev with considerable condescension; Akayev, in turn, has been highly deferential to his much stronger neighbor. Although Uzbekistan has not shown overt expansionist tendencies, the Kyrgyz government is acutely aware of the implications of Karimov's assertions that he is responsible for the well- being of all Uzbeks, regardless of their nation of residence.  History   Russian and Soviet rules  The Russians started their conquest in the middle of 19th century. During that era, the Russian Empire had mainly attacked Central Asian Emirates like Emirate of Bukhara or Khanate of Khiva. They also invaded the Qing's Kyrgyz territory and annexed them into Russian Turkestan. By settling the capital in the Uzbek city of Tashkent, the conflict between two peoples began to grow. But unlike the Tajik-Uzbek conflict, the Kyrgyz-Uzbek conflict emerged slower. The Russians referred Kyrgyzs are \\"nomandic\\" while Uzbeks are \\"sedentary\\". After the collapse of Russian Empire in 1917, Basmachi Revolt had emerged into a total Central Asian war. The Kyrgyzs and Uzbeks raised hands together and fight against Russian forces. Due to lack of skills and preparation, the Revolt soon failed and the Russians, now under Soviet Union rule, restored the order again. During the World War II, many Caucasian peoples (Georgians, Azerbaijanis, Armenians, Circassians, etc.) were forced to exile. Many of them remained in Central Asia, from which mostly remain in Uzbekistan today. However, since the end of the war, conflicts between Kyrgyzs and Uzbeks began to emerge into a larger clash. In 1990, near the collapse of Soviet Union, Osh riots had happened, killing nearly 1000 people, mainly ethnic Kyrgyzs and Uzbeks. The clash began in June and ended in August, but found themselves an unprofitable aftermath. Transportation In March 2018, Uzbekistan Railways began a new service, connecting Tashkent with Balykchy.
