He also wrote under the names \\"R. Rolinato\\" and \\"Vasyl Rolenko\\".  Biography  Kulik was born in the city of Shpola, in the Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire (now in Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine) into the family of a teacher. He finished fourth-grade college in Uman where he moved with his parents. There his first poem was published in the Uman newspaper Provincial voice (\\"–ü—Ä–æ–≤–∏–Ω—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –≥–æ–ª–æ—Å\\"), in Russian. In 1911 he enrolled into the Odessa Art academy. In 1914, together with his parents, he emigrated to the United States. There he worked in the factories and mines in Pennsylvania. He began publishing his poems in the local Russian newspaper New world (\\"–ù–æ–≤—ã–π –º–∏—Ä\\"). In 1914 he became a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In spring 1917 Kulik travelled through the Russian Far East and Siberia, returning to Kiev where he joined the local revkom. He actively participated in the Kiev Bolshevik Uprising that led to the establishment of the Soviet government in Kiev. In December 1917 he was elected to the Central Executive Committee of Soviets and the first Soviet government of the Ukrainian SSR (heading the People's Secretariat of the Foreign Affairs). In summer of 1918 together with Vitaliy Primakov participated in the formations of the Red Cossacks military units. From May 1921 to May 1922 he was a secretary of the Kamyanets-Podilsky branch of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine. There he edited the local newspaper Red Truth, simultaneously teaching history in the Institute of the People's Education. At this time he published his poem the Green heart (1921, ). In 1924‚Äì1926 he was consul of the Soviet Union in Canada. From September 15, 1930 to June 1932 he returned to Kamyanets-Podilsky as secretary of a raion committee.

He was born in Queenstown, South Africa. He competed mainly in Great Britain and found his form in hard court tournaments. He notably won the mixed doubles championships at Wimbledon in 1928 with Elizabeth Ryan and at the French Open in 1931 with Betty Nuthall. Tennis career Patrick Spence began his tennis prominence in Great Britain in 1922 when he became Scottish champion after winning the local tournament. The next year he defended his title. In 1924 he took the Middlesex Championships against compatriot Louis Raymond, with whom he also won the doubles title, but lost the mixed doubles title against him. He first became the covered courts champion at the Queen's Club the same year by beating reigning champion Patrick Wheatley in three sets. In April 1925 he won the British Hard Court Championships over Charles Kingsley. He also won the mixed doubles partnering Evelyn Colyer. A week later, at the Surrey Hard Court Championships, he defeated Randolph Lycett of Australia in straight sets. At another hard court tournament in London he was defeated by Indian Sydney M. Jacob in five sets. He shared the doubles victory with Raymond and the mixed doubles with Colyer. In October he successfully defended his covered courts title against Edward Higgs. That month he failed to capture the Drive Club title. In 1926 he was a finalist for the Kent Championships. In 1927 Spence reached the semi finals of the French championships, beating Frank Hunter before losing to Rene Lacoste. He met Lacoste for his second British Hard Court Championships trophy but was subdued in straight sets. He also lost the doubles against the French team of Lacoste and Brugnon. The next year they had their rematch also in the final and Lacoste overcame Spence for the second time. In 1928 he was upset in the final of the Kent Championships for the second time. He also lost the Middlesex Championships to Randolph Lycett. However, he was more successful in his mixed doubles matches, including the final of the Nottingham Championships, which he won with his partner Betty Nuthall. One of his biggest accomplishments came when he took the 1928 Wimbledon Championships mixed doubles contest alongside Elizabeth Ryan. In 1930, as a member of the International Tennis Club of Great Britain, he participated in the team challenge against Rot-Weiss Club of Berlin, winning all of his four matches (two singles and two doubles) and defeating high-profile players such as Daniel Prenn and Heinrich Kleinschroth. Also in 1930 he lost the London Covered Courts Championships to Yoshiro Ohta, but as many times before he was triumphant in the mixed contest with his recurring partner Nuthall. In 1931 he was a runner-up for the doubles tournament of the West-England Championships, partnering Edward Avory, but eventually lost to the Japanese pair of Jiro Satoh and Ryuki Miki. He was also runner up in the Championship of London in doubles. As in his previous years his breakthrough came in the mixed doubles competitions; first he and Betty Nuthall went for the British Hard Court Championships in April and were only eliminated in the final, while in May they won the mixed title at the French Championships (now the French Open). A couple of years later, in 1935, he reached the final of the Surrey Grass Court Championships, where he was stopped by New Zealand's Eskell D. Andrews. The importance of that particular match was the test of a new service rule implemented for the first time there, which allowed the server to swing his leg over the baseline on serve but introduced the service box. In 1936 he won the Queen's Club hard court doubles with John Olliff. In the Davis Cup he set a 14‚Äì7 match record (66% winning ratio) and represented South Africa from 1924 to 1931. Personal life Patrick Spence was born 11 February 1898 in Queenstown, Cape Colony. He moved to Edinburgh, Great Britain right after the First World War. He graduated from Edinburgh University with a doctorate in medicine. Apart from playing tennis, he was an amateur rugby player. He worked at Guy's Hospital in London and then in Richmond in 1930. Later with several colleagues he was in private practice in Kingston-on-Thames as Howlett, Kemp, Carson and Spence, from which he retired in 1934. He formed a real-life couple with his 18-year-old doubles partner Betty Nuthall, with whom he went on to win the French Open mixed doubles tournament in 1931. Playing style British Davis Cup team member Nigel Sharpe described him as an attacking type of player. He preferred to pace the ball rather than give it a spin. He tended to go to the net, but his volley showed indecisiveness. He possessed a severe overhead shot. He had a long-swinged forehand, on which he applied a moderate topspin. His backhand was quite weak, and so he always placed himself to receive the ball to his forehand side.

Since 1976 St Giles' parish has been a member of the Lower Windrush Benefice along with the parishes of Northmoor, Stanton Harcourt and Yelford. History The Church of England parish church of Saint Giles dates from the latter part of the 12th century, and the chancel arch, west wall of the nave and Norman font survive from this time. In the first half of the 13th century the chancel was rebuilt and north and south transepts were added, all in an Early English Gothic style. The north transept and east end of the chancel retain some lancet windows from this time. The north aisle is 14th century but the square bases of the columns of its arcade look 12th century, suggesting that it was rebuilt from an earlier north aisle that was either purely Norman or Transitional from Norman to Early English. The south aisle, however, is purely early 14th century, as are the Decorated Gothic windows in both aisles. In the middle of the 14th century the arcade between the nave and the north aisle was rebuilt with Decorated Gothic columns, new windows were inserted in the north walls of the chancel and the north transept, and an unusual slender octagonal bell tower with a small spire was added at the west end of the nave. In about 1500 a clerestory was added to the nave and Perpendicular Gothic windows were inserted on the south side of the chancel and at the west end of the south aisle. Restoration In the 19th century the church building deteriorated until the Gothic Revival architect C.C. Rolfe restored it in phases from 1880 to 1891. Rolfe rediscovered and reopened 13th century windows in the chancel, north transept and at the west end of the north aisle and blocked the windows that had been added to the chancel in the 14th and 15th centuries. Rolfe rebuilt the porch, which was probably 14th century, reusing its original materials. Rolfe also re-roofed and refurnished the entire building, for which all the woodcarving was undertaken by Harry Hems of Exeter. The spire was restored in 1911. The roof developed structural defects in the 20th century and in the Second World War it was damaged by a bomb. It was repaired in about 1950 and the church was reroofed in the 1990s. Bells The west tower has a ring of six bells. The second, third and fifth bells were cast in 1709 and 1710: the survivors of a ring of five cast by Henry III Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire. William Taylor cast the tenor bell in 1843, presumably at his then bell-foundry in Oxford. Mears and Stainbank or the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble bell in 1887. The fourth bell was recast in 1931. St Giles' has also a Sanctus bell, which Thomas Rudhall of Gloucester cast in 1781.

In 1984, Addictive used the short-lived Silicon Joy label for games by other authors, 'specially selected' by Kevin Toms, but in 1985, after Toms launched his next game Software Star, Addictive also began publishing games by other authors including Boffin by Paul Julian O'Malley and Kirel by Siegfried Kurtz. Headcoach, an American football sports strategy game written by Simon Davies was released in the summer of 1986 and reached No. 3 in the W H Smith UK sales charts.ZX Computing, November 1986; p5. Toms went on to write the political strategy game President released in 1987. The company was bought by Prism Leisure Corporation in 1987. Prism used the Addictive name for full price game releases (including HotShot in 1988, The Kristal in 1989 and the later Football Manager games), as well as selling older Addictive games (particularly Football Manager) in their budget ranges and in compilations.

Plot  The novel, described by the publisher as, ‚Äúa remarkable thriller that takes us through the streets of Istanbul,‚Äù tells the story the privileged young Arda, who reflects the life of his murdered father, after the death of his overbearing mother, and ‚Äòyour humble servant‚Äô Bedirhan, who has decided to pack in his ten-year career as an assassin, as their two lives become intrinsically bound, while, Sel√ßuk Altun, a former family friend, provides Arda with clues to track down his father's killer.

The Real Audiencia of Charcas, with support from the faculty of University of Saint Francis Xavier, deposed the governor and formed a junta. The revolution is known in Bolivia as the \\"First libertarian scream\\" (), meaning, the first step in the Spanish American wars of independence; but historians dispute whether such a description is accurate or not. Causes Although nearly 30 years had passed, the indigenous revolutions led by T√∫pac Amar√∫ II and Tom√°s Katari, and their violent repression, were still remembered. Those revolutions ranged from the south of modern Colombia to the north of modern Argentina and Chile. There was great concern about recent developments at Spain. French forces led by Napoleon had invaded many parts of the country and captured the Spanish king Ferdinand VII, replacing him with the French Joseph Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon. Without the authority of a king leading them, the Spanish resistance created Government Juntas. Development The news of the fall of Ferdinand VII in Spain caused great concern in the city, and in the University of Chuquisaca there were important debates about the legitimacy of the government. Bernardo de Monteagudo explained an idea that promoted Self-determination, which would be later known as \\"Syllogism of Chuquisaca\\" It stated the following: The junta, initially loyal to King Ferdinand VII of Spain, was justified by the suspicion that Garc√≠a Le√≥n de Pizarro planned to turn the country over to Princess Carlota Joaquina, wife of Prince Regent John of Portugal and Brazil, but from the beginning the revolution provided a framework for the actions of the separatists who spread the rebellion to La Paz, where a Junta Tuitiva (\\"protecting junta\\") was formed on 16 July. The latter clearly broke with any authority in Spain and with the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata. After the second, more radical uprising was repressed violently by an army sent by Viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, the movement at Chuquisaca lost all external support and was finally undone by forces sent from Lima by Viceroy Jos√© Fernando de Abascal in October. Historiography This revolution did not intend to alter Chuquisaca's loyalty to the king, while the revolution of La Paz openly declared independence. Today, historians do not agree on whether the revolution of Chuquisaca was motivated by independence or if it was just a dispute between supporters of Ferdinand VII and Carlota. Consequently, there is disagreement on whether the first revolution to proclaim independence in Spanish America was that of Chuquisaca or that of La Paz. The researchers Juan Reyes and Genoveva Loza support the latter, arguing that in Chuquisaca the Spanish system of government was maintained and that it did not support the revolution in La Paz, while others such as Charles Arnade, Teodocio Ima√±a, Gabriel Ren√© Moreno or Felipe Pigna argue that the Chuquisaca revolution supported independence, citing as its main foundation the political philosophical concept of the \\"Syllogism of Chuquisaca\\" that proposed self- determination. Even more, Other historians locate the first \\"libertarian scream\\" at Ecuador rather than Bolivia, because of a revolt that took place in Quito in August, 1809.Primer grito libertario Bibliography * See also * Bolivian War of Independence * La Paz revolution *May Revolution References External links * 25 de mayo: 1809 Insurrecci√≥n en Chuquisaca ‚Äì 1810 Revoluci√≥n en Buenos Aires Category:1809 in Bolivia Category:1810s in Bolivia Category:Bolivian War of Independence Category:Colonial Bolivia Category:Conflicts in 1809 Category:19th-century rebellions Category:19th century in the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata Category:May 1809 events ","title":"Chuquisaca Revolution"},{"id":"24941563","text":"Many and Many a Year Ago (Turkish title: Senelerce Senelerce Evveldi) is a 2008 novel by Turkish writer Sel√ßuk Altun republished in 2009 by Telegram Books in English language translation by Clifford and Selhan Endres.  Plot  The novel tells the story of Kemal, a convalescing Turkish fighter pilot, who, after his friend mysteriously disappears, is left with a generous allowance and the use of his large house in Istanbul‚Äôs Taksim district. Kemal subsequently embarks on a mysterious mission following in the fictitious footsteps of American writer Edgar Allan Poe from Istanbul to Buenos Aires, and eventually to the Edgar Allan Poe museum in Boston where he decides to enter a writing competition with a novel called Many and Many a Year Ago. This novel is, according to the author, ‚Äúa literary thriller like my other novels,‚Äù but, ‚Äúcan also be regarded an ‚Äòexperimental mystery‚Äô book,‚Äù as it, ‚Äúalso includes eight short stories that overlap with the novel's plot,‚Äù ‚Äútold with an outlook similar to that of Scheherazade, the narrator of One Thousand and One Nights.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is part literature and part travel book, a little bit of Paul Auster and Bruce Chatwin,‚Äù he states, ‚Äúwhat I tried to do was imagine what the life of a post-modern, well-off Poe would have been like.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow, I can only wonder what Americans, should they get the chance to read it, will think of my Turkish interpretation of this American master.‚Äù  Publishing history  Telegram Books opted to translate and publish this novel following the commercial and critical success of the publication of Altun‚Äôs self-financed English language translation of his previous novel Songs My Mother Never Taught Me. This is a novel that proceeds under the shadow of Edgar Allan Poe,‚Äù the author told Today's Zaman, ‚ÄúI started writing ‚ÄúMany and Many a Year Ago‚Äù in 2006, and it was published in Turkey in early 2008. I later noticed that 2009 was Poe's bicentennial. So actually, it neither had an effect on my decision to write this book, nor on its plot.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt was sort of like its destiny that it's being introduced in the Anglo-American literary world in 2009, which is Poe's bicentennial.‚Äù ‚ÄúI hadn‚Äôt planned it this way, but it‚Äôs very gratifying,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI take a lot of inspiration from Poe. While working on this book, I went to Poe‚Äôs graveside myself and I honestly believe he helped me with it.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhile I was walking rather hesitantly toward Poe's tomb in Baltimore, I had an ultra-interesting experience: It was at that very moment that I resolved the novel's finale in my head. I think that [moment] was an ultra surprising climax. Later I felt as though Poe was watching me allusively from his photograph on his headstone.‚Äù  Reception  ‚ÄúI doubt whether such a book will receive much attention in the Anglo-American book industry,‚Äù he author told Today's Zaman, ‚ÄúBut I would be happy if it does not go unnoticed. Usually my foremost concern is the risk of my publisher losing money because of me. But as far as I can see from the first orders in the UK, it seems I will not be putting a burden on my publisher.‚Äù References Category:2008 novels Category:Novels by Sel√ßuk Altun Category:Crime novels Category:Novels set in Turkey ","title":"Many and Many a Year Ago"},{"id":"24941584","text":"Three warships of Japan have borne the name : * , a destroyer launched in 1920, renamed Patrol Boat No.1 in 1940 and sunk in 1943. * , a one-off World War II period super-destroyer launched in 1942 and sunk in 1944 * , a guided missile destroyer commissioned in 1988 and operated by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF).

Life Hinrichs was born in 1836 in Lunden in the Duchy of Holstein, which at that time was under the rule of Denmark although it was simultaneously part of the German Confederation. He attended the local polytechnic school and the University of Copenhagen. During his schooling he published several articles and books, including descriptions of the magnetic field of earth and its interaction with the aether. Hinrichs graduated in 1860, between the First and Second Schleswig Wars. He emigrated later that year to the United States, settling initially in Davenport, Iowa, where he taught school, then in nearby Iowa City. In 1863 he was appointed a professor of natural philosophy, chemistry, and modern languages at the University of Iowa. He founded the first state weather and crop service in the United States and headed the Iowa Weather Service until 1886. He was first to identify and name the straight-line storm phenomenon he called the \\"derecho.\\" He stayed at the University of Iowa until 1886, when he was fired by the state Board of Regents due to disputes with the university president and faculty colleagues. He became a professor at the St. Louis University in 1889 and taught there until his retirement in 1907. Periodic law Hinrichs is one of the discoverers of the periodic laws, which are the basis for the periodic table of elements. Although his contribution is not generally considered as important as those of Dmitri Mendeleev or Lothar Meyer, he presented his ideas as early as 1855 and published his book Programme der Atommechanik in 1867. His periodic table had the form of a spiral, and the elements were placed into the structure according to their atomic mass. Hinrichs also postulated a theory on the cause of the periodicity within the chemical elements based on his theory of the composition of elements out of smaller Panatome. The Trigonoides were the nonmetals made from regular triangles, while the metallic Tetragonoides were made from squares. Algebraic formulas of how to mix squares and triangles yielded the periodic laws. His \\"controversial ideas and colorful personality\\" proved to be an obstacle to the acceptance of his theories.

Biography Early life and background Gamon was the second of three sons born to John Percival Gamon (1865‚Äì1934), a solicitor and notary, and his wife Margaret Alice (n√©e Geddes), of Chester, Cheshire. His elder brother, Captain Sydney Percival Gamon (1895‚Äì1918) served in the Cheshire Regiment before joining the Royal Flying Corps. Posted to a Home Defence squadron, he was killed in a flying accident, aged 23. The youngest brother, Geoffrey Alexander Percival Gamon (1901‚Äì1934), was also killed in an accident in Cairo. World War I Gamon entered the Royal Naval Air Service as a probationary temporary flight sub- lieutenant, being commissioned as a flight sub-lieutenant on 30 July 1916, five days after his 18th birthday. Assigned to No. 5 Squadron RNAS, flying the DH.4, Gamon gained his first victory on 8 December 1917 forcing down an Albatros D.V over Aertrycke airfield. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 31 December 1917. Gamon's next victory came on 30 March 1918 when he destroyed a Fokker Dr.I during the First Battle of Villers-Bretonneux, and a result he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. His citation reads: :Flight Lieutenant John Gamon, RNAS. ::For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. On 30 March 1918, whilst returning from a bombing raid, he was attacked by three enemy triplanes, one of which he brought down and drove off the other two. He has carried out very many bombing raids on enemy lines of communication, aerodromes, and dumps. His work has always been of the greatest merit, and he has set a splendid example to those around him. Two days later, on 1 April, the Royal Naval Air Service and the Army's Royal Flying Corps were merged to form the Royal Air Force, and No. 5 Squadron RNAS was renamed No. 205 Squadron RAF. Gamon was promoted to captain on 4 April. He accounted for two more enemy aircraft on 23 April, and shared two more on 3 May, all over Chaulnes. His seventh and final victory came on 20 May, destroying a Pfalz D.III over Mericombe. Gamon left the RAF after the war, being transferred to the unemployed list on 11 June 1919. World War II The Gamon family window at Chester Cathedral Gamon returned to military service during World War II, being commissioned as a probationary pilot officer \\"for the duration of hostilities\\" in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on 27 September 1940. He was confirmed in his appointment, and promoted to the war substantive rank of flying officer on 27 September 1941. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 January 1944. He remained in the Air Force Reserves after the war, finally relinquishing his commission on 10 February 1954, being permitted to retain the rank of flight lieutenant. Gamon died on 5 December 1976, and he, alongside his father and brothers, is commemorated in a window in the cloister of Chester Cathedral.

He was also the PA voice for the Los Angeles Rams and USC Trojans football and basketball teams. He also announced four Super Bowls in Southern California and one in Palo Alto, California, as well as serving as the basketball PA voice during the 1984 Summer Olympics. His voice was also heard through seven World Series, the 1959, 1967 and 1980 Major League Baseball All- Star Games, ten NBA Finals, the 1963 and 1972 NBA All-Star Games. Ramsey, a native of Berlin, New Hampshire, served in the United States Navy during World War II. When the war ended Ramsey moved to Los Angeles, attending El Camino College and then the University of Southern California, from where he graduated in 1954 and later obtained a master's degree in Business. Upon the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles in 1958, Ramsey was hired by the team to be their PA announcer. Two years later, the Lakers moved from Minneapolis and Ramsey became their PA announcer. From their inception in 1961 until the mid-1980s, Ramsey was also the PA announcer for the Angels during their tenancies at Wrigley Field and Dodger Stadium and after their move to Anaheim in 1966. And when the Los Angeles Kings began play in 1967, Ramsey became their original PA voice. Over the years Ramsey would also assume PA announcing duties for the Rams and the USC Trojans, with whom he remained until 1989. He also was the PA voice for the Raiders during their first year in Los Angeles. At one time Ramsey would often announce five sporting events over a three-day weekend, a feat rivaled only by Bruce Binkowski, who was a PA voice for San Diego sporting events. Although noted for an articulate, deliberate and unruffled announcing style, sometimes he would mess up, as evidenced when a 1960s Dodgers game was delayed: \\"Ladies and gentlemen, while our ballgame is being temporarily held up because of rainy weather here at Dodger Stadium, our well- known organist, who is located in the centerfield bleachers, is going to entertain you by diddling on his organ.\\" (This announcement was recreated in Kermit Schaefer's 1974 documentary, Pardon My Blooper.) In addition to Dodger Stadium, Ramsey could be heard at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Sports Arena, Anaheim Stadium and the Forum. Ramsey left the Lakers and Kings in 1978. His successors included Dennis Packer, who became the PA voice of the Kings in 1979, the Raiders from 1983 until they returned to Oakland in 1995, the Angels during much of the 1980s, the Trojans' PA voice since 1990 and the San Diego Chargers replacing Binkowski; Lawrence Tanter, took over the Lakers and whose career as the Lakers' PA voice has eclipsed that of Ramsey; and Nick Nickson, who took over the Dodgers' and the Kings' PA announcing duties before switching to play-by-play announcing for the Kings in 1993. Former Angels, Clippers and Kings PA announcer David Courtney's career is owed to Ramsey; Courtney began his professional career as a PR assistant for the Kings in 1971 and occasionally filled in for Ramsey at the Forum before becoming a full-time PA announcer himself. Ramsey could also be heard in various movies, including Two-Minute Warning. In later years, Ramsey suffered from diabetes. He died on January 25, 1990 at Long Beach Veterans' Hospital of a heart attack at age 62. John Ramsey's grandson, John Lamb, born seven months after Ramsey's death, made his Major League Baseball debut as the starting pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds at Dodger Stadium on August 14, 2015. https://dodgers.mlblogs.com/grandson-of-former-dodger-stadium-pa-announcer- making-mlb-debut-tonight-at-dodger-stadium-cbd6f92a43b3 References *CLIPPERS:P.A.

It is a name shared by Polish team Cracovia. The club was initially based in Perth before moving to premises in Barlee Street, Highgate in 1972. The club was based in Highgate until 1990 when it moved to its current location in Beechboro. Success In 1965, after a number of seasons in the lower divisions of the Western Australia State League, Cracovia with the assistance of the Polish Olympic Committee recruited a number of seasoned Polish footballers including W≈Çadys≈Çaw Musia≈Ç, Pawe≈Ç Sobek, Zygmunt Pieda and Henryk Lukoszek. Success was immediate with Cracovia winning the first division in 1965 and the State League in 1966. Decline After a decade near the top of the State League Cracovia were relegated in 1974. From that point the club's success was limited to brief spells in the top flight before leaving the semi-professional competition in the mid-90s to compete in the state amateur competition. During the early 1980s Bobby Moore played one match as a guest for Cracovia. Due to regulations of the state soccer federation the club was known as Beechboro White Eagles in the 1990s.

In December 1861, the town of Potosi, Kansas, along the Kansas- Missouri border, was attacked by Confederate guerrillas. Very soon Col. James Montgomery stationed the Kansas 3rd Regiment about 4 miles (6 km) to the northeast. The new camp, named Camp Defiance, was established December 17.

Mine Creek provided a natural defense on the camp's north side, as neither man nor horse could have negotiated the water and steep bank. Today the site is heavily wooded and it had at least some timber when it was used. Dr. Joseph H. Trego, stationed at Camp Defiance, said the camp had a mill and of lumber was used to construct stables, mess tables and floors for tents. Very few structures were built and the men stayed in tents. Instead of having a guardhouse, the post had a guard tent.Pollard, memorandum to Daniel C. Fitzgerald, June 1, 1993, p. 1; Trego, pp. 149, 154-5.

He was the top ace of Marine Feld Jasta III (MFJ III) of the German Naval Air Service, and was one of the few aces allowed to fly the Fokker E.V monoplane. Goerth received the Iron Cross First Class and other awards for his service. After the war, in 1919, the pilot participated in Kampfgeschwader Sachsenberg, commanded by fellow World War I ace Gotthard Sachsenberg. Early military career German insignia 1918 Hans Goerth initially served in Kusta III. He was then with Marine Feld Jasta I from 26 February 1918 until 21 June 1918, after which he transferred to Marine Feld Jasta III, which was formed that month. He remained in Marine Feld Jasta III until the end of the war. Goerth was credited with seven aerial victories. Marine Feld Jasta III, established at the Jabbeke aerodrome on 23 June 1918, was commanded by Leutnant der Reserve der Matrosenartillerie (MA-naval artillery) Gustav Brockhoff, who had at least four confirmed victories during World War I. MFJ III remained at Jabbeke airfield, also referred to as Varsenare or Snellegem, until retreat in early October 1918. With seven confirmed victories, Hans Goerth was the top ace of MFJ III. Albatros D.Va Goerth earned his first two victories while flying an Albatros D.Va with serial number 7167/18. The first plane, Airco de Havilland DH.4 (A8013), was shot down over Mariakerke, Belgium on 30 June 1918. Lieutenant Clifford James Moir and Serjeant Mechanic Edwin Edward Hunnisett, both of No. 217 Squadron of the Royal Air Force died in that conflict. Goerth's second victory was an Airco DH.9 that was taken down over Nieuwpoort, West Flanders, Belgium on 7 July 1918. Lieutenant J. R. Harington and Second Lieutenant Cyril Ivor Bray were the aviators in the DH.9. Both men from No. 206 Squadron of the Royal Air Force were buried in adjacent graves at Anzac Cemetery in Sailly-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France. On 16 July 1918, over Zevekote, West Flanders, Belgium, Goerth shot down DH.4 (A7868) piloted by British flying ace Lieutenant Lionel Arthur Ashfield of the No. 202 Squadron of the 61st wing of the Royal Air Force. That combat triumph also claimed the life of Irish Lieutenant Maurice Graham English. Goerth's fourth victory took place west of Handzame, West Flanders on 30 August 1918, when he shot down Sopwith Camel (D9482) of the No. 65 Squadron of the Royal Air Force from his Fokker D.VII (Albatros) with serial number 838/18. The aviator in the Camel was Second Lieutenant Henry George Pike. He died in the encounter and is represented on the Arras Flying Services Memorial at the Faubourg d'Amiens Cemetery. Pike is also commemorated at Wandsworth Cemetery in Wandsworth, Greater London, England. Fokker D.VII(F) Goerth's remaining victories were from D.VII aircraft as well. On 16 September, Goerth shot down Sopwith Camel (B7271) over Zerkegem, West Flanders. Second Lieutenant Edward Burleigh Markquick of the No. 210 Squadron died in that confrontation and is commemorated on the Arras Flying Services Memorial. Goerth's final two victories (sixth and seventh) both occurred on 1 October 1918. During aerial combat, he first shot down a DH.9 from No. 108 Squadron south of Houthulst, West Flanders and, twenty-five minutes later, a Sopwith Camel from No. 210 Squadron south of Handzame. That day Goerth was piloting a Fokker D.VII marked with a black heart on a white band. Hans Goerth received the Landfliegerabzeichen on 22 May 1918 and the Ehrenrpreis on 28 July 1918. The ace was promoted to Vizeflugmeister in September 1918 and he was the recipient of the Iron Cross First Class. Later military career Fokker D.VIII By the fall of 1918, Idflieg (Inspektion der Fliegertruppen - \\"Inspectorate of Flying Troops\\"), had chosen successors to the Fokker D.VII. One that saw action at the front was the Fokker E.V, which was later known as the Fokker D.VIII and nicknamed the \\"Flying Razor.\\" It was regarded as one of the best German fighter aircraft in the war. At the direction of Anthony Fokker, the Dutch founder of the company, the bottom wings were removed from a D.VII. The resultant aircraft outperformed the original and was designated the V.26; a subsequent modification with a rotary engine led to the V.28. A further modification with advanced cantilever wings resulted in the E.V, which originally had 110 horsepower engines. As 140 horsepower engines became available, they were installed in the planes. An E.V with a factory-installed 140 horsepower engine was designated as a D.VIII; if retrofitted, it retained the E.V designation. Early in production, there were some wing problems that occurred due to a modification that had been requested based on outdated testing; by reverting to the original design, the problem was corrected. Hans Goerth was the top flying ace of his unit, Marine Feld Jasta III, with seven confirmed victories, and was one of the few aviators to have the opportunity to take the D.VIII into aerial combat. A World War I photograph of Goerth shows a dapper young man posed in front of a Fokker E.V with yellow cowling, wheels, and tail. A Fokker D.VIII was the last fighter plane to record an aerial victory during World War I. After the war, World War I ace Leutnant zur See Gotthard Sachsenberg, who had commanded the Marine Jagdgruppe Flandern, formed Kampfgeschwader Sachsenberg in January 1919. This large unit of about 700 personnel was primarily composed of volunteers who had served in World War I. The unit included several aces, Hans Goerth among them. They fought the Red Army in the Baltic states in 1919. They primarily flew ground support missions to assist the Freikorps units fighting the Russian communists in the Baltic area, and withdrew in December 1919.

It catalogues the ornithological artwork of 19th century Australian settler John Cotton, along with biographical information about him, reproductions of selected sketches and paintings, and extracts from his journals. The 'Port Phillip District of New South Wales' in the book's title roughly corresponds geographically to the Australian state of Victoria which was only formed in 1851, shortly after Cotton's death.McEvey (1974). The book is 230 mm high by 324 mm wide and was issued in a slipcase. It was authored by Allan McEvey and contains a foreword by Alec H. Chisholm, as well as a biographical introduction by Cotton's great- granddaughter, Maie Casey, who also sponsored the production of the book. The book is a tribute to Cotton and his ornithological and artistic talents. After migrating from England to Australia and establishing himself and his family on a sheep station on the Goulburn River, he began to study, collect and sketch the birds there. However, his plans to produce a book on Victorian birds ultimately came to nothing through historical circumstance and his own early death three days before his 48th birthday, with his journals and artwork unpublished, scattered among his descendants and lost to the world for over 120 years. Of Cotton's talents as an artist, McEvey says:McEvey (1974), p.45. The book was reviewed in the journal Emu by Roy Wheeler (as W.R.W.), who said:W.R.W. (1976).

The hemispherical voids and pits result from the selective dissolution of carbonate concretions within the greywacke. The greywacke is identifiable by its low metamorphic grade and the 10‚Äì40% rock fragments, distinctive volcanic clasts, and spherical carbonate concretions that it contains. Omars are typically rounded and range in size from pebbles to boulders. Their rounded shape, whether found in glacial tills or glacial-fluvial (outwash) gravels, indicate that they were eroded from pre-existing littoral or fluvial deposits. Omars are typically found associated with granules and pebbles of oolitic jasper that were transported from the Belcher Islands in Hudson Bay, Canada.Donaldson, A. and V.K.

The name given these glacial erratics refer to their source, which is the Proterozoic Omarolluk Formation in the Belcher Islands in southeast Hudson Bay. The Laurentide Ice Sheet eroded omars from the Belcher Islands, an archipelago limited to only about a quarter of 1% of Hudson Bay. Glaciers moved omars from the southeastern part of Hudson Bay to central Canada and into the U.S. where they were deposited on moraines. Because scientists know precisely where they came from they are very valuable in documenting the movement of glaciers.Dutch, S. (n.d.) Leaverites - Features in Sedimentary Rocks.

Turnstone Geological Services Ltd, Campbellford, Ontario, Canada. Downloaded October 28, 2009  Etymology  There is uncertainty on how to translate the proper name Omarolluk (and omar rocks). According to the records of the Canada Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation Natural Resources, the features Omarolluk Sound and Omarolluk Formation were named after Omarolluk, an Inuit man who accompanied and guided R. J. Flaherty on numerous geological surveys of the Belcher Islands and elsewhere in the Canadian north. He was probably an Inuktitut-dialect speaker from the eastern coast of Hudson Bay. The spelling likely varied from the originally pronounced but unrecorded aural form of the name. Despite the expected natural-feature designations, Omarolluk was surely an actual person. There are three possible translations, as follows: (1) Best: In the subdialect (Itivimiut) of the Nunavik dialect of Inuktitut, the phoneme /j/ was and still is up to a point pronounced more or less like English r and generally transcribed as such, and so the name in the standard Canadian Inuit spelling might have been *Uumajurluk (pronounced /uumaruRluk/: r = English r; R = French r), that is, ‚Äòbad animal‚Äô (uumajuq ‚Äòanimal‚Äô; luk ‚Äòbad‚Äô) as a guess.Louis-Jacques Dorais, pers. comm., 16 January 2019 (2) Somewhat similar but possibly: ‚Äòpoor reason for being alive‚Äô, uumaq-jjut-luk ‚Äòbe.alive‚Äìreason.for/cause.for‚Äìbad/poor‚Äô (-jjut takes the form -rut after the uvular [q] and then deletes it, at least in the contemporary language). The initial o is dubious for an expected u.Anonymous supplied through Marguerite Mackenzie, 15 January 2019 (3) A distant Yup‚Äôik possibility if applied to a rock stratum: Umaq is a seam between the upper and lower parts of a kamik (sealskin boot); the ruq part would mean ‚Äòto become‚Äô, and luk is the ‚Äòit‚Äô, thus imperfectly ‚Äòit becomes a seam‚Äô, but if umaaq, then it becomes ‚Äòrip (at the seam)‚Äô, a verb, which would mean something like ‚Äòit has a habit of ripping at the seam‚Äô.Michael Arvaarluk Kusugak, Vancouver Island, 7 January 2019Supplied by Carl Masthay, St. Louis, Missouri, 28 January 2019  See also  * Adder stone, Eurasian natural rocks with holes. * Cupstone, true Native American artifacts. * Pholad borings, similar rock holes caused by certain types of bivalves. * Lithic technology References Prest, V.K.

Its purpose is to protect the toilet's user from germs that may be resting on the seat by creating a protective barrier. Coin-Op Toilet Seat Cover Dispenser circa 1940s The first known patented model of the toilet seat cover dispenser dates back to 1942 and was invented by J.C. Thomasa. The photo of the \\"Germ Free Toilet Seat Covers Dispenser\\" is one of the original Thomasa Seat Cover Dispensers and is on display at the DFW Elite Museum of Haltom City, Texas.

Terminology Confusingly, the term is also sometimes used for decorative covers for the toilet seat, or even the toilet seat lid, if present. These covers generally do not serve a sanitary purpose, and may even pose difficulties with cleaning and sanitization if they are made of porous materials or are unsuitably shaped. The descriptive qualifier \\"disposable\\" is added to clarify the intended use of some toilet seat covers. Use A toilet seat cover dispenser with instructions, aboard a bus in North America Toilet seat covers are generally held in a dispenser, allowing the users to access one cover at a time, without making unnecessary contact with additional toilet seat covers. While toilet seat covers give public toilet users a sense of security, studies have shown they do not necessarily protect a toilet user from disease. For example, if a toilet user is negligent enough to place a toilet-seat cover while the seat is still wet with liquid waste the fluids can soak through the cover and make contact with the user. Orientation There has been much debate among those who use toilet covers, regarding the orientation of said toilet seat cover. The proper way to place a cover on a toilet seat is to place the side with the flap toward the front of the toilet, with the flap going in the toilet to prevent \\"splashing\\" forward. Most public toilet seats are \\"U\\" shaped with an exposed rim in the front; the flap prevents particles and germs from collecting there. Laws Automatic self-renewing toilet seat cover (New Orleans) In 2009, legislators in Maine rejected legislation that would have required toilet-seat covers be placed in all restrooms. The bill was referred to the Committee on Health and Human Services, but eventually filed without further action being taken to enact the law.

(9 April 1898 ‚Äì 13 September 1947) was an English World War I flying ace credited with seven aerial victories. Biography He was the second son of Thomas Seaman and Louisa Green of Burslem. His father was a grocer, baker, and provision dealer, who served as a member of the borough council, as a councillor for the East Ward, in 1906‚Äì1908. His older brother Thomas Seaman Green (1895‚Äì1917), served as a lieutenant in No. 3 Squadron RFC and was killed in action near Heilly, on 13 February 1917, aged 22. Green enlisted into the 28th (County of London) Battalion of the London Regiment (Artists' Rifles) as a private (No. 765446) in 1917. At this time the Artists' Rifles battalions were officer training units, which supplied 10,256 officers to other units over the course of the war. Green was transferred to the General List to be appointed a second lieutenant (on probation) in the Royal Flying Corps on 12 August 1917. He was confirmed in his rank and appointed a flying officer on 15 October 1917. Green was assigned to No. 32 Squadron, flying the S.E.5a single-seat fighter. He gained his first aerial victory on 2 April 1918, the day after the Army's Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) were merged to form the Royal Air Force, by driving down a Pfalz D.III out of control north- east of Moreuil. Several weeks later, on 16 May he sent another Pfalz D.III down in flames over Fresnes. On 9 June 1918, by then a lieutenant, he was appointed temporary captain, and served as flight commander of \\"B\\" Flight. July 1918 proved the high point of Green's combat career, driving down a Pfalz D.III over Dormans on the 15th, and a Fokker D.VII over Tr√©loup the next day. On 22 July he drove down another D.VII over Mont-Notre-Dame, and on the 25th another D.VII over Fismes. He gained his seventh and final victory on 23 August, destroying a Fokker D.VII east of Douai. Green finally left No. 32 Squadron on 8 September 1918. On 29 November 1918 his award of the Distinguished Flying Cross was gazetted, the citation reading: :Lieutenant (Acting Captain) Wilfred Barrat Green ::A bold and very gallant officer who has destroyed two enemy aeroplanes and driven down five out of control. He has also shown a fine offensive spirit in engaging ground targets during the recent battles, using his machine guns with great effect. On the same day he also received permission to wear the Croix de Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur awarded by France. He also received the Croix de Guerre avec Palme from France. His permission to wear it was gazetted on 11 July 1919.

He served as head football coach at Western Kentucky University 1968 to 1983, compiling a record of 106‚Äì56‚Äì6. Early life and playing career Feix attended Barret Manual Training School, a predecessor to Henderson City High School in Henderson, Kentucky. He played quarterback for Western Kentucky University from 1949 to 1952. His first start came in the third game of the 1949 season. In reference to his early success Feix said \\"I got to play a lot and played early. I remember that I was surrounded with a lot of good athletes.\\" In 1952, he became the first WKU athlete to be named an All-American. He was also named to the All-Ohio Valley Conference team in 1951 and 1952 and was named to the conference's all-time team in 1988. As a senior in 1952, Feix guided the Hilltoppers to their first OVC football championship with a 9-1 record and the school's first bowl game appearance. WKU was invited to the Refrigerator Bowl in Evansville, Ind. where they beat Arkansas State 34-19. Feix Stats were very impressive that year. He led the nation's college quarterbacks with a 63.1 percent completion percentage, making good on 111 of 176 passes for 1,581 yards and 15 touchdowns. He also ranked fourth in the country in passing and sixth in total offense. During his entire playing career at WKU his teams went 24‚Äì12‚Äì2. Drafted by the NFL's New York Giants, he unfortunately suffered an injury during a 1953 pre-season game forcing him to give up his playing career. Coaching career Feix, after his injury, set off for the United States Air Force. One of his many responsibilities while serving for the Air Force was to coach baseball, football and volleyball teams on the base. One day, Feix was coaching a 15-year-old how to pick off a base runner and at that moment he realized what he wanted to do with his life. \\"There I was out on that field in the sunshine, the breeze blowing and the 15-year old eating up what I was talking about\\", Feix said. \\"I went home that day at noon and told my wife, Frankie, 'we're gonna get out of this air force. I'm gonna try to find a coaching job somewhere because I think I wanna be a coach.'\\" After serving four years in the Air Force, Feix returned to WKU in 1957 to become the Assistant Football Coach under Coach Nick Denes. Feix was in charge of the offensive backfield. \\"I learned a lot from Coach Denes\\", Feix said. \\"He was a great man and a great coach. The thing I remember always is he emphasized that the player was the most important part of the program. The student athlete was the key and not to be carried away with how great a coach you were or what kind of facilities you had.\\" In 1968 after 11 years as the Assistant Football Coach, Feix was promoted to Head Coach, replacing the retiring Nick Denes. Feix continued as head coach until his retirement in 1983. As head coach at WKU, Feix's teams went 106‚Äì56‚Äì6, won or shared six OVC championships and were national runners-up in NCAA Division II in 1973 and 1975. He was named OVC's Coach of the year three times (1973, 1978, 1980) and he still remains the most winning football coach in WKU history (64.88%). Coach Feix's players were also successful. Feix produce nine AP all-Americans and 73 all-Ohio Valley Conference selections. Coach Jimmy Feix has also been featured on a special edition 1984 Coke bottle commemorating his historic achievement as WKU's most winning coach. The bottle features a picture of Coach Feix, The words \\"The Winningest Coach in Western Kentucky Football History\\" and \\"Coke & Jimmy, A Winning Pair\\" The reverse has Coach Feix's overall record broken down by each season. After his retirement, Coach Feix spent two years in Alumni Affairs before taking over as the university's Director of Athletics from 1986 to 1991. He is a charter member of WKU's Athletic Hall of Fame and WKU's football playing field has been named after him. Western Kentucky University's brand new Alumni Center will have a ballroom named after Coach Feix. Coach Feix responded to this honor by saying \\"I have had so many wonderful memories at Western, from a football player in the University's first Bowl game, to being named a Football All-American, to coaching 11 years as an Assistant Coach and 16 years as a Head Coach, to my years in administration,\\" he said. \\"We had some great games and made some wonderful memories‚Äîit would be impossible to choose just one as the best one.\\" He died at a hospital in Bowling Green in 2014. Personal life Feix lived in Bowling Green with his wife, Frankie. They had two children, Jimmy and Jeff. Coach Feix remained active at the school attending every home game he could. Having been diagnosed with Parkinsons Disease it became increasingly hard for him to attend all the games. Coach Feix gave speeches to the current football team as necessary. He continued to make a big impact on the current players. In 2011 senior running, at the time, Bobby Rainey and junior tight end Jack Doyle hand-delivered Feix a team birthday card on his 80th birthday. Head coaching record From 1973 to 1977, the Grantland Rice Bowl was a national semifinal game for Division II and the Camellia Bowl was the championship game.

Education Ottendorfer was the son of a manufacturer, the youngest of six children. He was sent to live with a married sister in Brunn. There he studied the classics in the gymnasium. At the age of 20, he left to study jurisprudence at the University of Vienna, and then transferred to the University of Prague to learn the Czech language. Revolutionary In 1848, he returned to Vienna, intending to finish his studies in Padua, which at that time was in the possession of Austria. However, the upheavals at that time enlisted his sympathies. Ottendorfer joined the Von der Tann volunteer corps, and briefly served in the first Schleswig-Holstein War. On returning to Vienna during the Vienna Rebellion, he found the revolutionaries in control of the government, and joined the mobile guard as a 1st lieutenant. During the storming of the city by government forces in October, he was in the battalion that was commanded by Robert Blum. Many of his fellow revolutionaries were captured or killed. He managed to escape. He was concealed by a friendly porter in a bookstore until the excitement subsided, and then fled to the Bohemian frontier, and from there to Saxony. He subsequently became involved in the 1849 uprisings in Saxony and Baden, after the failure of which, he fled to Switzerland. He briefly considered giving himself up to the government in Vienna, but was informed that would cost him his life, and so went to the United States. Journalism On his arrival in New York City, he knew Latin, Greek, Hebrew and several Slavic languages, but no English, and for two or three months after his arrival, he was able to earn no more than a bare subsistence. Then he found employment in the counting room of the Staats-Zeitung. After the death of its proprietor, Jacob Uhl, in 1852, the management of the paper devolved to his widow, and the services of Ottendorfer became gradually more important. He became editor in 1858 and wed Jacob Uhl's widow, Anna Uhl, in 1859. The year of his marriage, he returned to Europe, but avoided Austria, though he was assured he would not be bothered there. In 1866, he did visit Austria. He was editor and publisher of the Staats-Zeitung from 1859 to 1900; his wife was business manager until her death in 1884. As the German-born population of New York City increased, his journal, in which he endeavored to reflect the sentiments of German-Americans, became one of the most widely circulated and influential in New York. Politics Ottendorfer adhered to the principles of the Democratic Party, but joined no political organization, and maintained an independent position. He was an advocate of civil service reform, and active in promoting improvements in the public school system. He supported Stephen Douglas in 1860; he was a \\"Union Democrat\\" opposed to Fernando Wood's \\"Peace Democrats\\" who were Confederate sympathizers. From 1872 to 1874 he was an alderman, and in 1874 a candidate for Mayor of New York City. Several times he was a presidential elector. Philanthropy Besides other charitable gifts, Ottendorfer gave $300,000 to build and endow an educational institution in his native town in Austria. On Long Island, New York, he founded a home for aged and indigent men, and established the Ottendorfer Free Library (now the Ottendorfer Branch of the New York Public Library system which it joined in the 1890sNYC - East Village: New York Public Library, Ottendorfer Branch at flickr.com) on Second Avenue, New York City, at an original cost of $50,000, which was augmented by annual gifts. His wife, Anna Ottendorfer, was also a noted philanthropist. Later years In later life, Ottendorfer retired from active journalism on account of failing health, and spent most of his time in Europe.

It has one runway and is used for general aviation and extensive skydiving. The airport operates from dawn to dusk daily year-round.  Facilities  Perris Valley Airport has one runway: * Runway 15/33: x . Surface: asphalt. The airport does not have a control tower, runway lights, or approach lights. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) classifies the northern section of runway in poor condition. FAA inspectors determined the remaining section of runway is in good condition. The northern is closed indefinitely. Aircraft maintenance and repair services are available. The airport provides aviation fuel to the general public only on an emergency basis. The airport is home to 125 ultralight aircraft and 16 conventional aircraft. Conventional aircraft include ten single engine planes, five twin engine planes, and one jet aircraft. The primary occupant is Skydive Perris. A skydiving drop zone operates at the airport, and skydivers land about 50 feet from the runway. Skydiving operations run from early morning to dusk daily unless limited by weather or safety factors. Skydive Perris operates a fleet of six aircraft, consisting of a Skyvan, a Super 300 Twin Otter, two Super Twin Otters, a Pilatus Porter and a twin engine DC-9 jet.Perris Valley Skydiving: Facilities - Aircraft Retrieved: 27 May 2009. The DC-9 is the only civilian jet FAA-certified for skydiving. Skydivers fly to jump altitude (13,000 feet) in about 12 minutes. Skydive Perris provides skydiving opportunities to beginners and experts alike. Beginners can choose Tandem or Accelerated Freefall skydiving. As a drop zone, Skydive Perris was small compared to the neighboring world-famous Lake Elsinore drop zone until heavy rains flooded the airport in 1980 and the skydivers moved to Perris for a drop zone. Perry Valley Airport gained worldwide recognition that year when the world record night dive of 27 jumpers was organized. Accidents and incidents *On 4 May 1984, Douglas DC-3C N157U of Perris Valley Paracenter was damaged beyond economic repair when the port engine lost a propellor blade on take-off, causing the engine to be torn from its mountings. There were no injuries among the two crew and 31 parachutists on board. A mandatory Airworthiness Directive had been issued concerning the propellor, but an investigation found no evidence that it had been complied with. *On April 22, 1992, a skydiving aircraft lost engine power during takeoff and crashed. The plane never climbed more than 50 feet above the runway. There were 22 on board, sixteen of whom (two pilots and 14 skydivers, including 2 Dutch nationals) died in the crash. Two other Dutch skydivers survived, as did three Americans and a South African.NTSB Chairman's speech to Parachute Industry Association Retrieved: 27 May 2009. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) attributed engine failure to aviation fuel contaminated by improper fuel handling. The pilots' response to engine failure also contributed to the crash. Apparently there was a design flaw in the Otter that facilitated accidental beta configuration of the propellers in an emergency situation. In a flight simulator, shortly after the crash, two other very experienced and current Otter pilots did the same thing as the pilot on the ill-fated flight. *On 24 May 2017, a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter crashed on landing after a skydiving flight. The pilot and trainee pilot were uninjured but the right wing was torn from the aircraft.

Recognizing language as a social practice, identity highlights how language constructs and is constructed by a variety of relationships. Because of the diverse positions from which language learners can participate in social life, identity is theorized as multiple, subject to change, and a site of struggle. The diverse conditions under which language learners speak, read, or write the second language are influenced by relations of power in different sites; learners who may be marginalized in one site may be highly valued in another. For this reason, every time language learners interact in the second language, whether in the oral or written mode, they are engaged in identity construction and negotiation. However, structural conditions and social contexts are not entirely determined. Through human agency, language learners who struggle to speak from one identity position may be able to reframe their relationship with their interlocutors and claim alternative, more powerful identities from which to speak, thereby enabling learning to take place. Early developments The relationship between identity and language learning is of interest to scholars in the fields of second language acquisition (SLA), language education, sociolinguistics, and applied linguistics. It is best understood in the context of a shift in the field from a predominantly psycholinguistic approach to SLA to include a greater focus on sociological and cultural dimensions of language learning,Firth, A. & Wagner, J. (1997). On discourse, communication, and (some) fundamental concepts in SLA research. Modern Language Journal, 81, 286-300.Morgan, B. (2007). Poststructuralism and applied linguistics: Complementary approaches to identity and culture in ELT. In J. Cummins & C. Davison (Eds.), International handbook of English language teaching (pp. 1033-1052). New York: Springer.Norton, B., & Toohey, K. (2001). Changing perspectives on good language learners. TESOL Quarterly, 35(2), 307-322. or what has been called the ‚Äúsocial turn‚Äù in SLA.Block, D. (2003). The social turn in second language acquisition. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. Thus while much research on language learning in the 1970s and 1980s was directed toward investigating the personalities, learning styles, and motivations of individual learners, contemporary researchers of identity are centrally concerned with the diverse social, historical, and cultural contexts in which language learning takes place, and how learners negotiate and sometimes resist the diverse positions those contexts offer them. Further, identity theorists question the view that learners can be defined in binary terms as motivated or unmotivated, introverted or extroverted, without considering that such affective factors are frequently socially constructed in inequitable relations of power, changing across time and space, and possibly coexisting in contradictory ways within a single individual. Many scholarsBlock, D. (2007a). The rise of identity in SLA research, post Firth and Wagner (1997), Modern Language Journal, 91, 863-876.Menard-Warwick, J.(2006).

TESOL Quarterly, 40 (1), 35-58. cite educational theorist Bonny Norton‚Äôs conceptualization of identity (Norton Peirce, 1995; Norton, 1997; Norton, 2000/2013) as foundational in language learning research. Her theorization highlights how learners participate in diverse learning contexts where they position themselves and are positioned in different ways. Drawing from poststructuralist Christine Weedon's (1987) notion of subjectivity and sociologist Pierre Bourdieu's (1991) power to impose reception, Norton demonstrated how learners construct and negotiate multiple identities through language, reframing relationships so that they may claim their position as legitimate speakers. .  The Race Aspect  People go about seeing language and identity as some structured definitions from the dictionary that they just follow by. Although there are structural definitions for the words language and identity, some people have their different perspectives of them. In the essays written by James Baldwin he was able to grasp a new meaning and new perspective of reading and writing because of the way these authors portray these words. We have come to a point where language somewhat links with identity. The two terms at times can go hand in hand like black and white or like a peas in a pod. In the essay, ‚ÄúIf Black isn‚Äôt English, Then tell Me What Is?‚Äù by James Baldwin talked a lot about the way he saw language to be and the way he felt that both language and identity is linked. In his essay he said, Language is the most crucial key to identity. This statement helped to show readers that we would not be who we are without language. Also it shows on his main idea about Black English because if it did not have the kind of significant personality they have today. Language, incontestably, reveals the speaker . Baldwin consistently stressed on how the way one uses language can show the person the speaker is. Which shows how important it is for a person to embrace their language for their personality to be seen positively by others. Baldwin‚Äôs stress on language and identity through his different ideas really helped to open a door in every readers mind because it makes them now think back and see how language helped to form their identity. Contemporary ideas Since Norton's conception of identity in the 1990s, it has become a central construct in language learning research foregrounded by scholars such as David Block, Aneta Pavlenko, Kelleen Toohey, Margaret Early, Peter De Costa and Christina Higgins. A number of researchers have explored how Identity categories of race, gender, class and sexual orientation may impact the language learning process. Identity now features in most encyclopedias and handbooks of language learning and teaching, and work has extended to the broader field of applied linguistics to include identity and pragmatics, sociolinguistics, and discourse. In 2015, the theme of the American Association of Applied Linguistics (AAAL) conference held in Toronto was identity, and the journal Annual Review of Applied Linguistics in the same year focused on issues of identity, with prominent scholars discussing the construct in relation to a number of topics. These included translanguaging (Angela Creese and Adrian Blackledge), transnationalism and multilingualism (Patricia Duff), technology (Steven Thorne) and migration (Ruth Wodak). Closely linked to identity is Norton's construct of investment which complements theories of motivation in SLA. Norton argues that a learner may be a highly motivated language learner, but may nevertheless have little investment in the language practices of a given classroom or community, which may, for example, be racist, sexist, elitist, or homophobic. Thus, while motivation can be seen as a primarily psychological construct,Dornyei, Z. (2001). Motivational strategies in the language classroom. Cambridge, UK:Cambridge University Press. investment is framed within a sociological framework, and seeks to make a meaningful connection between a learner‚Äôs desire and commitment to learn a language, and their complex identity. The construct of investment has sparked considerable interest and research in the field.Arkoudis, S. & Davison, C. (Eds.). (2008).

Investigating Cambodian women‚Äôs participation and investment in adult ESL programs. Adult Education Quarterly, 53(1), 9-26. Darvin and Norton's (2015) model of investment in language learning locates investment at the intersection of identity, capital, and ideology. Responding to conditions of mobility and fluidity that characterize the 21st century, the model highlights how learners are able to move across online and offline spaces, performing multiple identities while negotiating different forms of capital.Darvin, R., & Norton, B. (2015). Identity and a Model of Investment in Applied Linguistics. Annual Review of Applied Linguistics, 35, 36-56. An extension of interest in identity and investment concerns the imagined communities that language learners may aspire to join when they learn a new language. The term ‚Äúimagined community‚Äù, originally coined by Benedict Anderson (1991), was introduced to the language learning community by Norton (2001), who argued that in many language classrooms, the targeted community may be, to some extent, a reconstruction of past communities and historically constituted relationships, but also a community of the imagination, a desired community that offers possibilities for an enhanced range of identity options in the future. These innovative ideas, inspired also by Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger (1991) and Wenger (1998), are more fully developed in Kanno and Norton (2003), and Pavlenko and Norton (2007), and have proved generative in diverse research sites.Carroll, S., Motha, S., & Price, J. (2008). Accessing imagined communities and reinscribing regimes of truth. Critical Inquiry in Language Studies, 5, 3, 165-191.Dagenais, D., Moore, D., Lamarre, S., Sabatier, C., & Armand, F. (2008).

Imagined communities and national fantasies in the O.J. Simpson case. Journal of Language, Identity, and Education, 2, 4, 319-330. An imagined community assumes an imagined identity, and a learner‚Äôs investment in the second language can be understood within this context. Towards the future There is now a wealth of research that explores the relationship between identity, language learning, and language teaching.See \\"Key Books\\" and \\"Other Relevant Books\\" Themes on identity include: race, gender, class, sexual orientation, and disability. Further, the award-winning Journal of Language, Identity, and Education, launched in 2002, ensures that issues of identity and language learning will remain at the forefront of research on language education, applied linguistics, and SLA in the future. Issues of identity are seen to be relevant not only to language learners, but to language teachers, teacher educators, and researchers. There is an increasing interest in the ways in which advances in technology have impacted both language learner and teacher identity, and the ways in which the forces of globalization are implicated in identity construction. Many established journals in the field welcome research on identity and language learning, including: Applied Linguistics, Critical Inquiry in Language Studies, Language Learning, Language and Education, Linguistics and Education, Modern Language Journal, and TESOL Quarterly. Key books Block, D. (2007). Second language identities. London/New York: Continuum In this monograph, Block insightfully traces research interest in second language identities from the 1960s to the present. He draws on a wide range of social theory, and brings a fresh analysis to studies of adult migrants, foreign language learners, and study-abroad students. Burck, C. (2005/7). Multilingual living. Explorations of language and subjectivity. Basingstoke, England and New York: Palgrave Macmillan. This book presents a discursive and narrative analysis of speakers' own accounts of the challenges and advantages of living in several languages at individual, family and societal levels, which gives weight to ideas on hybridity and postmodern multiplicity. Norton, B. (2013). Identity and language learning: Extending the conversation. Bristol: Multilingual Matters. In this second edition of a highly cited study of immigrant language learners, Norton draws on poststructuralist theory to argue for a conception of the learner identity as multiple, a site of struggle, and subject to change. She also develops the construct of ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù to better understand the relationship between language learners and the target language. The second edition includes an insightful Afterword by Claire Kramsch. Pavlenko, A. and Blackledge, A. (Eds). (2004). Negotiation of identities in multilingual contexts. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters. The authors in this comprehensive collection examine the ways in which identities are negotiated in diverse multilingual settings. They analyse the discourses of education, autobiography, politics, and youth culture, demonstrating the ways in which languages may be sites of resistance, empowerment, or discrimination. Toohey, K. (2000). Learning English at school: Identity, social relations and classroom practice. Cleveland, UK: Multilingual Matters. Drawing on an exemplary ethnography of young English language learners, Toohey investigates the ways in which classroom practices are implicated in the range of identity options available to language learners. She draws on sociocultural and poststructural theory to better understand the classroom community as a site of identity negotiation. Other relevant books *Blackledge, A. & Creese, A. (2010).

It comes in a number of forms, including toothpaste, mouthwash and gel. Ingredients Regular The main active ingredient in its toothpastes is sodium monofluorophosphate, and prior to the GlaxoSmithKline acquisition it also contained enzymes including glucose oxidase, lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase and lysozyme. PBF The PBF ORAL RINSE (plaque biofilm) product contains the enzymes mutanase, dextranase, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, and glucose oxidase. Benefits People with xerostomia (dry mouth) may use Biot√®ne to reduce the rate of recurrence of dental plaque. However, Biotene by itself does not significantly reduce the count of Streptococcus mutans which is the primary initiator of the formation of dental plaque. Biot√®ne relieves symptoms of dry mouth by providing moisture. Dry mouth can be caused by multiple factors affecting the salivary gland.Taiji, O., Mariko, H., Kazunori, I., Shigetada, K., & Yoshinobu, M. (2017). \\"Microbiological assessment of effects of clinical mouth rinses on common oral microbes\\". Journal Of Oral Science, 59(3), 391-395. By keeping the mouth moisturized, Biot√®ne prevents various complications that can arise from prolonged dry mouth. For example, dry mouth results in the impairment of the antimicrobial properties of saliva, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections. Also, by improving the lubrication of the oropharyngeal mucosa, Biot√®ne can facilitate swallowing and decrease the chances of developing dysphagia.Rogus-Pulia, N.M., Gangnon, R., Kind, A. et al. Dysphagia (2017). \\"A Pilot Study of Perceived Mouth Dryness, Perceived Swallowing Effort, and Saliva Substitute Effects in Healthy Adults Across the Age Range\\". A 2017 pilot study found that perceived swallowing effort decreases significantly following application of a saliva substitute. Biot√®ne compensates for decreased salivary composition. Lack of saliva compromises the composition and beneficial properties necessary for maintaining the health of the oral cavity and reduces antibacterial actions, which leads to disruption of the oral pH; consequently allowing cariogenic microorganisms to grow and colonize the oral cavity.Nehme, M., Malpass, K., Butler, A., Mason, S., Kleber, C., Milleman, K., et al. ‚ÄúA Randomized, Crossover Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Two Mouthrinses on Plaque Regrowth in the Absence of Brushing‚Äù. International Journal Of Periodontics & Restorative Dentistry [serial on the Internet]. (n.d.), [cited October 16, 2017]; 35(3): 387-393. Available from: Science Citation Index. When stimulation of salivary secretion fails, palliative oral care in the form of mouthwashes and saliva substitutes can be used to counterbalance the lack of initial salivary function. Varying saliva substitutes containing different enzymes, such as those found in Biot√®ne products, reduce oral infection and enhance mouth wetting.NieuwAmerongen, A.; Veerman, E. (2003). \\"Current therapies for xerostomia and salivary gland hypofunction associated with cancer therapies\\". Support Care Cancer, 11: 226. Biot√®ne mouth rinses have shown inhibitory effects on growth of preformed biofilms on certain tested bacterial and fungal strains. However, Biot√®ne alone does not act via prevention of plaque build-up mechanism or antimicrobial chemotherapeutic mechanism. Biot√®ne brand products  The product line includes toothpaste, mouthwash, spray and gel.  Mechanism of action  The three primary enzymes in Biot√®ne are Glucose Oxidase, Lactoperoxidase, and Lysozyme.Gil-Montoya, J. A., Guardia-L√≥pez, I. and Gonz√°lez-Moles, M. A. (2008). \\"Evaluation of the clinical efficacy of a mouthwash and oral gel containing the antimicrobial proteins lactoperoxidase, lysozyme and lactoferrin in elderly patients with dry mouth ‚Äì a pilot study\\". Gerodontology, 25: 3‚Äì9. Through antibacterial and healing properties creating a natural protection within the oral cavity, these enzymes are balanced to function to boost and replenish an individual‚Äôs salivary defenses.Kocak, M.M., Ozcan, S., Kocak, S., Topuz, O., Erten, H. (2009). \\"Comparison of the Efficacy of Three Different Mouthrinse Solutions in Decreasing the Level of Streptococcus Mutans in Saliva\\". European Journal of Dentistry, 3(1):57-61. The reduced antibacterial actions of saliva due to the lack of saliva in some individuals can lead to disruption of the oral pH, allowing cariogenic microorganisms to grow and colonize the oral cavity. For individuals with xerostomia, a commercially available mouthrinse that can be safely used daily to aid in dry mouth relief is essential in oral health maintenance. Various commercially available mouthrinses have been tested on their inhibitory effects on biofilm formation over a 24h period. By slowing the formation of biofilm formation, individuals who use Biot√®ne may reduce the risk of dental caries and other oral diseases that may occur from xerostomia and bacterial accumulation, thus aiding in improving oral and overall health for the long term. However, not all studies support the claim that Biot√®ne makes. For instance, Peridex mouthrinse, an antimicrobial chlorhexidine-based formulation, demonstrated significantly greater prevention of plaque regrowth when compared with water and the enzyme-based Biot√®ne mouthrinse.

Its primary use was signals intelligence collection during the Cold War. History Part of Gablingen Kaserne was constructed prior to World War I for use by the Royal Bavarian Air Force. The airfield was closed in 1918 and flight activities were prohibited in 1919 as a result of the Treaty of Versailles.USAAF Advance Landing Ground R-77 Gablingen, Germany Reopened in 1936 as a Luftwaffe airfield, Gablingen was home to three Luftwaffe flying schools: Flugzeugf√ºhrerschule A5, Nachtjadgschule 1, and Flugzeugf√ºhrerschule C7. In addition, the entire facility was enlarged as one of the two German Air Bases in the Augsburg area, the other one being Lechfeld Airbase. The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 One of the most interesting aspects of the history of Gablingen is the complex tunnel system beneath the old airdrome, which may have been used to conceal the existence of a Messerschmitt test facility located there prior to, and during, the Second World War. The Messerschmitt plant used laborers from the Dachau concentration camp. Messerschmitt's rocket-powered Messerschmitt Me 163 were tested at this facility as early as 1941. American forces seized the base almost unopposed on 1 May 1945 and the facility was quickly secured.

Introduced in 2009, the brand is a fusion of regular action figures with an online game. It involves taking a dinosaur (both well-known and lesser-known dinosaurs) and extracting \\"DNA\\" samples from the dinosaur and analyzing it on your computer, similar in a way to the book and film Jurassic Park. If you own multiple dinosaurs and have extracted samples from all of them, you can create a genetically engineered hybrid on the computer to battle the \\"Megavores\\", ancient reawakened dinosaurs that share qualities with your dinosaur. Each dinosaur you purchase has a special ability, and combining them makes a fierce fighting animal (your first dinosaur, Tyrannosaurus rex, has the Chomp ability). This encourages the fusion of certain samples even more. The https://www.xtractaurs.com site has been taken down, and no usable site has been implemented for the toy series. As a result, there is no use for the toy sets other than display. Sampling To play the game, you must first purchase the Starter Kit, containing a DNA extractor gun, a Tyrannosaurus rex, and the Xtractaurs installation CD. You first must insert the CD into your computer to install the Xtractaurs software. Once installed, you can open the software, create an account (You must have Broadband Internet connection to play online), and can plug in your DNA extractor gun with a cable on the handle of the gun, which ends in a male USB plug. You are now ready for extraction. Your T. rex has a female TRS port, much like the one in an iPod or iPhone, in its thigh (as all dinosaurs under the brand do on a part of their body), and is compatible with a male TRS plug on the barrel of the extractor gun. When you plug the two, a display will appear on your screen showing a DNA strand. This means that electronics in the dinosaur are sending signals through the gun, through the cable, and into your computer. When done, an online version of your dinosaur pops up onto your screen. From there, you can play online games with your dinosaur, and begin your Xtractaurs adventure.

Harris Associates L.P., 559 U.S. 335 (2010), is a case decided by the United States Supreme Court in which investors claimed that the fees they paid to an investment advisor were too steep, violating the Investment Company Act of 1940..Justices Scrutinize Adviser Pay (NYT)Mutual Assured Destruction: A big financial compensation case hits the Supreme Court. (WSJ) The case held that the court has the jurisdiction to regulate fees of investment advisers in the mutual fund industry under the Investment Company Act of 1940, when those fees are excessive, and in breach of fiduciary duty. It is notable from a law and economics perspective for the vigorous opinion in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal of Judge Frank Easterbrook and the powerful dissent of Richard Posner, regarding the necessity and market failure in respect of adviser fee regulation.  Background  Harris Associates LP was the adviser to a set of $47bn Chicago funds including the Oakmark brands and is owned by French fund Natixis. The mutual funds are ‚Äòopen ended‚Äô meaning they buy back shares at current asset value. Harris Associates was sued by Jones and other investors in Harris‚Äô mutual funds. They argued that under the Investment Company Act 1940 s 36(b) and Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., 694 F.2d 923 (2d Cir. 1982) the company's fees were unreasonably high. After an adverse finding in the Illinois District Court, Jones appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Seventh Circuit The majority of the Court of Appeals ruled against the plaintiffs citing a lack of judicial authority to regulate investment company fees. Easterbrook, reading for the majority, argued that the free market was the best regulator of the fees. Easterbrook rejected the argument, saying the government was in no place to make such an assessment. ‚ÄòLike the plaintiffs, the second circuit in Gartenberg expressed some skepticism of competition‚Äôs power to constrain investment advisers‚Äô fees. Posner, reading a dissenting judgment, argued that the majority's decision ran counter to well established principle in Gartenberg, that the market was ineffective to solve the problem and that procedurally the decision was flawed since it was not circulated prior to publication, as is required in the case of a circuit split. He would have held that the case should be heard en banc (i.e. all the judges of the bench give a full hearing). Jones then appealed to the Supreme Court which granted certiorari on March 9, 2009.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court unanimously agreed with the plaintiffs and held the Seventh Circuit erred in holding that claims alleging mutual fund management's fees were too high is not cognizable under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act. Justice Alito wrote the majority opinion arguing the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals erred in not applying the established standard from Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc.. The Court established that the ICA requires for a claim to be valid there must be a determination that the fee is \\"so disproportionately large it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered.\\" Notes External links * Case Profile at ScotusWiki Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:2009 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court ","title":"Jones v.

Data acquired by DSLP will be used to reach these specific scientific goals: * Directional Measurements: Contrary to classical Langmuir probes, the new DSLP concept of data acquisition from the independent segments will enable to study also plasma characteristics in different directions. This should provide for example estimations of plasma flow velocity. Typically in the presence of magnetic field, electron temperatures are observed to be slightly different in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. This temperature anisotropy should be measured with DSLP by way of directional data acquisition. * Non-Maxwellian Features in Ionospheric Plasma: Classical theories for LPs are typically developed for plasmas in a thermodynamic equilibrium, that is for particle populations possessing Maxwellian velocity distribution functions. However, a thermodynamic equilibrium and thus a Maxwellian distribution is an idealized case while the real distribution in many plasma environments often exhibits various non- Maxwellian features, like loss-cone or flat-top distributions or high-energy tails. We intend to adapt the DSLP theoretical model in order to see whether such features exist also in ionospheric plasmas. * Ionospheric Irregularities: Ionosphere especially in the equatorial region possess several phenomena such equatorial ionization anomaly or ionospheric perturbations in auroral and cusp regions. The latitudinal distribution of these anomalies should be mapped during the whole mission. The effects are also highly dependent on space weather, on magnetospheric forces induced by solar, interplanetary and magnetospheric disturbances. Hence also coordination with LYRA and SWAP (other Proba 2 payload) measurements would be useful to find a correlation between particular solar events and ionospheric disturbances. * Ionospheric Perturbations by Solar Events (CMEs): This scientific objective will use cooperation with LYRA and SWAP experiments and further more enhance the sphere of interest. Detected solar event, if possible, should start DSLP burst measurement when the solar event affects the Earth. * Mapping Bulk Plasma Parameters: All acquired DSLP data will be used to map the bulk plasma parameters (primarily electron density and temperature) and to study their latitude and seasonal variations. The DSLP instrument consists of two Langmuir probes, electronics and small data processing unit. DSLP shares some interface, power and processing resources with TPMU experiment. DSLP has been developed on the basis of its predecessor ISL (Instrument Sonde de Langmuir), flown on the Demeter mission of CNES. DSLP was developed by the consortium of Astronomical Institute and Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic, Research and Scientific Support Department (RSSD) ESA ESTEC, Noordwijk, The Netherlands, Czech Space Research Centre (CSRC), Brno Czech Republic, and SPRINX Systems, Prague, Czech Republic.

Summer Camp The summer camp that takes place every summer at Burton 4-H Center is organized under Georgia 4-H Program. It last form 6 to 8 weeks depending upon camper registration and the year. Campers arrive on Monday and return home on a Friday. This leaves the weekend open for the camp counselors to prepare the center for the next week‚Äôs campers. The schedule changes each day of the week during camp season. Schools from all over the state participate in the summer camp program at Burton 4-H Center. Environmental education The Environmental Education program (EE) at Burton 4-H Center is the equivalent to a shortened version of the camping program. The 2 biggest differences are that the EE sessions range from 1 day to 3 days and they take place during the school year. The main objective of EE is to educate the public. This is why there are more classes and they last longer during the EE season. The major areas focused on in the curriculum at Burton 4H Center include but aren‚Äôt limited to the environment, thinking skills, and history. The Environmental Education program in Georgia serves an average of 35,000 students a year, making it the largest in the nation. Each center has an area of environmental education that they specialize in. Burton 4-H Center specializes in regional wildlife and history of the surrounding area.

In January 1924, Moon was flying a delivery of mail to an American Army base in the Panama Canal Zone when he discovered an American invasion fleet lying in wait away from Panama. The fleet was made up of four battleships, a carrier and attendant vessels. Their plan was to surprise and \\"defeat\\" the defenders of Panama as part of annual winter maneuvers.Holley, I. B.

Moon was carrying a case of ripe tomatoes to give to his wife, and he proceeded to carry out a series of dive bombing attacks against the USS Langley, delivering three direct hits from tomato \\"bombs\\". When he landed at the Panama base with the information that the fleet was coming, Moon was congratulated by his superiors. Soon, though, word was passed back regarding an unspoken goal of the surprise invasion fleet: they were there to prove that the Canal Zone needed a $10M purchase of 16-inch coastal defense guns. After the invasion fleet was discovered by an air unit while still 125 miles out, the need for coastal guns was no longer seen as urgent by Congress. However, air defense doctrine was not re-examined as a result. In 1924 or 1925, Moon taught bombardment to new airmen at Kelly Field in Texas.

From 1933 at the rank of captain until January 29, 1936, at the rank of major, Moon was assigned to teach at ACTS. Moon challenged his students to thoroughly examine the bombardment theories he presented so they could discover any flaws. There, Moon joined Harold L. George, Eugene L. Eubank, Haywood S. Hansell and Ralph A. Snavely in arguing for the primacy of an independent bomber arm. Moon was vocal in his rebuttal of the arguments used by a group of ACTS teachers who were promoting fighters as the all-around useful aircraft that the USAAC should invest in. The fighter enthusiasts‚ÄîClaire Chennault, Hoyt S. Vandenberg and Earle E. Partridge‚Äîargued that the fighter in large numbers was capable of doing more damage to ground targets than the number of bombers that could be bought for the same money. Moon and the so-called \\"Bomber mafia\\" tore the fighter argument apart and established precision bombing as the war-winning strategy.Moy, Timothy.

She was associated with the development of the German-language New Yorker Staats-Zeitung into a major newspaper. Early life Ottendorfer was born the daughter of a poor man named Behr. She came to the United States in 1837, and remained for a year with her brother in Niagara County, New York. Journalism In 1838, Ottendorfer married Jacob Uhl, a printer. In 1845, her husband purchased the New Yorker Staats-Zeitung, an influential and growing tri-weekly German- language newspaper owned and edited by Gustav Adolph Neumann.An Epitome of the New-Yorker Staats-Zeitung's Sixty-Five Years of Progress. 1899. Complimentary pamphlet prepared and distributed by the Staats-Zeitung to describe its history and new press capacity. Jacob Uhl's young wife helped him constantly, and, after a brief period, they were able to issue the publication daily. When, in 1852, Jacob Uhl died, leaving Anna Uhl with six children and a daily paper, she assumed the management of the paper. She declined several offers for the Staats-Zeitung, and, by her own energy and sagacity and the co- operation of Oswald Ottendorfer, who became editor in 1858 and who Anna married in 1859, made it one of the chief papers in the United States. By the 1870s, its circulation was comparable to English-language newspapers like the New York Tribune and The New York Times. Anna Ottendorfer took an active part in the management of the paper until almost the time of her death. In 1879, the property of the company was changed into a stock company. At Anna Ottendorfer's suggestion, the employees were provided with a 10% dividend on their annual salary. Later this was increased to 15%. Philanthropy Ottendorfer devoted much attention to charitable enterprises, her main interests being the welfare of women and children and German culture. In 1875, she established the Isabella Home for Aged Women in Astoria, Long Island (now Isabella Geriatric Center), named in memory of her deceased daughter, expending $150,000 on the building and endowment. She contributed $40,000 to an educational fund, built the women's pavilion of the German Hospital, New York City, at a cost of $75,000, and gave $100,000 for the German Dispensary. In 1883, Ottendorfer received a gold medal from the Empress Augusta of Germany in recognition of her aid to flood victims in that country in 1882 and 1883. In her will, she left additional sums for her charitable foundations, and bequeathed $25,000 to the employees of the Staats-Zeitung. Death Ottendorfer died at her home at 7 East 17th Street. A son and three daughters survived her. Two of her children had died, Hermann Uhl and Isabella Uhl. The surviving children were Emma Schalk; Edward Uhl, who succeeded as business manager at the Staats-Zeitung; Mathilde von Riedl; and Anna Woerishoffer. She had no children with Oswald Ottendorfer. Her funeral was the largest up to that time for a woman in New York City; the eulogy was by Carl Schurz. She left an estate of $3,000,000 and was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery. Her granddaughter Carola Woerishoffer was a labor activist and a major donor to Bryn Mawr College. Her great-grandson Antoine Seilern was an art collector.

History This six member group of experienced musicians came together in 2004 for informal shows at Toad (a pub in Cambridge) on Sunday nights, with Sean Staples (mandolin, guitar, vocals),\\"He Keeps Toad Hopping\\" by J.Perry, Boston Globe. June 20, 2008. Jim Fitting (harmonica, vocals), Ry Cavanaugh (multi instruments, vocals), Billy Beard (drums, vocals), Kimon Kirk (bass) and Dinty Child (multi instruments, vocals). Kirk moved to Los Angeles in early 2009 to play with, among others, Aimee Mann and Grant Lee Phillips, and was replaced by Jon Bistline. Kirk continued to be the primary touring bass player and eventually returned to the band full-time when Bistline decided to devote more time to his day job. Session Americana had a Sunday night residency at Toad for two years, moving to the larger Lizard Lounge in Cambridge, MA when their popularity outgrew Toad‚Äôs small capacity. The name Session Americana (the bartenders wrote it on the sandwich board outside of Toad on Sunday nights) went with them even though by this point they were evolving into more of a \\"band\\". Even though they have steadily played larger stages to more people, they've tried to hold onto the things that make them unique and their shows continue to involve the band facing each other around a table with a single mic in the middle, passing instruments around as needed, harmonizing on old blues tunes, classic Americana songs, oddball covers, and primarily original numbers written by the group members and their friends. A hallmark of Session Americana is their frequent collaboration on-stage with musical guests, including Rose Polenzani (with whom SA recorded ‚ÄúWhen the River Meets the Sea‚Äù in 2008), Jennifer Kimball (who is married to Cavanaugh), Dennis Brennan, Peter Wolf, Patty Griffin, Rachael Price, Aoife O'Donovan, and many more. The band released four albums and continued their Lizard Lounge residency until slowing down concert appearances in late 2009 following Cavanaugh and Kimball‚Äôs move to Ireland for 2009-2010.http://www.jenniferkimball.com. Accessed November 2, 2009 They reunited for a concert in October 2009 at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, MA, alongside Buffalo Tom‚Äôs Bill Janovitz, and again for a tour in Ireland in May 2010. On Kimball and Cavanaugh's return to Boston, the band started playing again regularly and have been back to Europe every year since, spending a total of seven weeks there in 2015. In 2015 they also outgrew the Lizard Lounge and started selling out venues like the Oberon Theater in Harvard Square as well as doing more extensive touring nationwide and playing festivals all over the country and in Europe. From the fall of 2010 the band worked without Sean Staples, who suffered a voice injury, and for five years evolved into more of a collective. Jefferson Hamer, Laura Cortese, Duke Levine, Jimmy Ryan (musician), Adam Moss, Alec Spiegelman, and Jason Anick have all been in \\"seat 6\\" since then, with Laura, Adam, and Jefferson doing the bulk of the gigs. January 2016 marked another turning point when Jefferson and the band wrote and recorded a new album Great Shakes in Kimon's house using Jefferson's engineering skills and extensive collection of gear. It was the first SA album completely conceived as a six piece band and Jefferson has been playing almost all the shows since then.

Advisors The teachers of Valley New School are referred to as advisors because they serve as coaches and mentors for the students.(2008). Report on the First Five Years. Valley New School. p. 10. Advisors coach students in academics, projects and personal issues. The student advisor ratio is limited to 17:1. Each student receives individual time with his or her advisor weekly, along with daily interactions. Advisors also make up the Site Management Committee, which governs the daily operation of Valley New School.Structure - Administration. (n.d.).

Project process Valley New School students use research projects aligning with their interests to gain school credit and cover state-issued learning standards.Projects - Overview. (n.d.). Retrieved October 14, 2010, from http://valleynewschool.com/projects/ Although projects range across a wide variety of topics, each follows the same basic process. The process has five phases: proposal, research, planning, production and evaluation.Projects - Anatomy of a Project. (n.d.). Retrieved October 20, 2010, from http://valleynewschool.com/projects/anatomy1.php In the proposal phase, students choose a topic and perform preliminary research to further understand what the topic is about. After that, they create a rationale detailing their interests in the project topic and a list of questions they plan to answer in the course of the project. The proposal phase ends when students meet with two advisors in a proposal meeting and discuss the plan for the project. Then students begin the research phase, during which they takes notes from a variety of sources. After students answers the questions they set out to resolve, they start the planning phase. In this phase, students meet with their advisors and decide how to represent their research in a product. Students then creates their products and written products in the production phase. In the evaluation phase, student write an analysis evaluating their progress over the course of the project as well as their learning and level of thinking. Finally, students meet with their advisors and discuss their performance and what they learned. Students earn school credit based on the time spent (typically 1 credit per 100 hours) and the quality of the project. Math and reading Because of Valley New School's lack of a formal class structure, math and reading are studied at an individual pace. Students learn math with an online program called ALEKS math and each student is required to spend an allotted half-hour each morning using the program. Reading is completed using a modified project process. Students create plans for a reading study, proposing their projects with their advisors. At the end of the year, students create a product that reflects what they read for the year. Service learning Valley New School requires each student to have a yearly service learning project, which use a modified project process. Student chooses a social issue within the community that interests them, find an organization in the area that addresses those issues, and perform service for them in effort to help solve the problem. Throughout the project, students document their experiences in time logs and produce an analysis document at the end of the project.

Description  OpenFlow enables network controllers to determine the path of network packets across a network of switches. The controllers are distinct from the switches. This separation of the control from the forwarding allows for more sophisticated traffic management than is feasible using access control lists (ACLs) and routing protocols. Also, OpenFlow allows switches from different vendors ‚Äî often each with their own proprietary interfaces and scripting languages ‚Äî to be managed remotely using a single, open protocol. The protocol's inventors consider OpenFlow an enabler of software-defined networking (SDN). OpenFlow allows remote administration of a layer 3 switch's packet forwarding tables, by adding, modifying and removing packet matching rules and actions. This way, routing decisions can be made periodically or ad hoc by the controller and translated into rules and actions with a configurable lifespan, which are then deployed to a switch's flow table, leaving the actual forwarding of matched packets to the switch at wire speed for the duration of those rules. Packets which are unmatched by the switch can be forwarded to the controller. The controller can then decide to modify existing flow table rules on one or more switches or to deploy new rules, to prevent a structural flow of traffic between switch and controller. It could even decide to forward the traffic itself, provided that it has told the switch to forward entire packets instead of just their header. The OpenFlow protocol is layered on top of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and prescribes the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS). Controllers should listen on TCP port 6653 for switches that want to set up a connection. Earlier versions of the OpenFlow protocol unofficially used port 6633. Some network control plane implementations use the protocol to manage the network forwarding elements. OpenFlow is mainly used between the switch and controller on a secure channel.  History  The Open Networking Foundation (ONF), a user-led organization dedicated to promotion and adoption of software-defined networking (SDN), manages the OpenFlow standard. ONF defines OpenFlow as the first standard communications interface defined between the control and forwarding layers of an SDN architecture. OpenFlow allows direct access to and manipulation of the forwarding plane of network devices such as switches and routers, both physical and virtual (hypervisor-based). It is the absence of an open interface to the forwarding plane that has led to the characterization of today's networking devices as monolithic, closed, and mainframe-like. A protocol like OpenFlow is needed to move network control out of proprietary network switches and into control software that's open source and locally managed. A number of network switch and router vendors announced intent to support or are shipping supported switches for OpenFlow, including Alcatel- Lucent, Big Switch Networks, Brocade Communications, and Radisys among others.  Development  Version 1.1 of the OpenFlow protocol was released on 28 February 2011, and new development of the standard was managed by the ONF. In December 2011, the ONF board approved OpenFlow version 1.2 and published it in February 2012. The current version of OpenFlow is 1.5.1. However, version 1.6 has been available since September 2016, but accessible only to ONF's members. In May 2011, Marvell and Larch Networks announced the availability of an OpenFlow-enabled, fully featured switching solution based on Marvell's networking control stack and the Prestera family of packet processors. Indiana University in May 2011 launched a SDN Interoperability Lab in conjunction with the ONF to test how well different vendors' software-defined networking and OpenFlow products work together. In June 2012, Infoblox released LINC, an open-source OpenFlow version 1.2 and 1.3 compliant software switch. In February 2012, Big Switch Networks released Project Floodlight, an Apache- licensed open-source software OpenFlow Controller, and announced its OpenFlow- based SDN Suite in November of that year, which contains a commercial controller, and virtual switching and tap monitoring applications. In February 2012, HP said it is supporting the standard on 16 of its Ethernet switch products. In April 2012, Google's Urs H√∂lzle described how the company's internal network had been completely re-designed over the previous two years to run under OpenFlow with substantial efficiency improvement. In January 2013, NEC unveiled a virtual switch for Microsoft's Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V hypervisor, which is designed to bring OpenFlow-based software-defined networking and network virtualisation to those Microsoft environments.

Origin The concept of Miss Fag Hag Pageant originated in Wellington, New Zealand, in 2007 and was first held in January 2008 as a search for the best fag hag. It was later emulated by gay bars in other New Zealand cities including Christchurch, Hamilton, and Auckland, and later in Melbourne, Australia, and New York, USA. The idea was created by Wellington nightclub and bar owner Greig Wilson. The inaugural winner was 22-year-old Veronica Mills. Miss Fag Hag Wellington 2009 was 21-year-old Nicole Johnston and Miss Fag Hag Wellington 2010 was 20-year-old Courtney Havill. Background Fag hag is a gay slang phrase referring to a woman who either associates mostly or exclusively with gay and bisexual men, or has gay and bisexual men as close friends. The phrase originated in gay male culture in the United States and was historically an insult. Some women who associate with gay men object to being called fag hags, while others embrace the term. The male counterpart, for men who have similar interpersonal relationships with gay and bisexual men is fag stag, part of hag-ism, the identification of a person with a group--usually united in terms of sexuality, gender identity, or shared sex--of which he or she is not officially a member. People who associate with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people may be called fruit flies regardless of their sex.

Detail from a painting by Bernard Picart. Competitive swimming in Britain started around 1830, mostly using breaststroke. Swimming was part of the first modern Olympic games in 1896 in Athens. In 1908, the world swimming association, F√©d√©ration Internationale de Natation (FINA), was formed.  Ancient times  Rock paintings from the Cave of Swimmers 10,000-year-old rock paintings of people swimming were found in the Cave of Swimmers near Wadi Sura in southwestern Egypt. These pictures seem to show breaststroke or doggy paddle, although it is also possible that the movements have a ritual meaning unrelated to swimming. An Egyptian clay seal dated between 9000 BC and 4000 BC shows four people who are believed to be swimming a variant of the front crawl. More references to swimming are found in the Babylonian and Assyrian wall drawings, depicting a variant of the breaststroke. The most famous drawings were found in the Kebir desert and are estimated to be from around 4000 BC. The Nagoda bas-relief also shows swimmers inside of men dating back from 3000 BC. The Indian palace Mohenjo Daro from 2800 BC contains a swimming pool sized 12 m by 7 m. The Minoan palace of Knossos in Crete also featured baths. An Egyptian tomb from 2000 BC shows a variant of front crawl. Depictions of swimmers have also been found from the Hittites, Minoans and other Middle Eastern civilizations, in the Tepantitla compound at Teotihuacan, and in mosaics in Pompeii. Written references date back to ancient times, with the earliest as early as 2000 BC. Such references occur in works like Gilgamesh, the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Bible (Ezekiel 47:5, Acts 27:42, Isaiah 25:11), Beowulf, and other sagas, although the style is never described. There are also many mentions of swimmers in the Vatican, Borgian and Bourbon codices. A series of reliefs from 850 BC in the Nimrud Gallery of the British Museum shows swimmers, mostly in military context, often using swimming aids.  Early modern era  Lifebelt sketch by Leonardo da Vinci (circa 1488‚Äì90). The book \\"A short introduction for to learne to swimme\\" - British Library Since swimming was done in a state of undress, it became less popular as society became more conservative in the early Modern period.Lixey L.C., Kevin. Sport and Christianity: A Sign of the Times in the Light of Faith. The Catholic University of America Press (October 31, 2012). p. 26. . Leonardo da Vinci made early sketches of lifebelts. In 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a Swiss‚ÄìGerman professor of languages, wrote the earliest known complete book about swimming, Colymbetes, sive de arte natandi dialogus et festivus et iucundus lectu (The Swimmer, or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming and Joyful and Pleasant to Read). His purpose was to reduce the dangers of drowning. The book contained a good methodical approach to learning breaststroke, and mentioned swimming aids such as air filled cow bladders, reed bundles, and cork belts. In 1587, Everard Digby also wrote a swimming book, claiming that humans could swim better than fish.The title runs: De Arte Natandi libri duo, quorum prior regulas ipsius artis, posterior vero praxin demonstrationemque continet, Lond. 1587, dedicated to Richard Nourtley. Digby was a Senior Fellow at St. John's College, Cambridge and was interested in the scientific method. His short treatise, De arte natandi, was written in Latin and contained over 40 woodcut illustrations depicting various methods of swimming, including the breaststroke, backstroke and crawl. Digby regarded the breaststroke as the most useful form of swimming. In 1603, Emperor Go-Yozei of Japan declared that schoolchildren should swim. In 1595, Christopher Middleton wrote \\"A short introduction for to learne to swimme\\", that was the first published guide recording drawings and examples of different swimming styles. In 1696, the French author Melchis√©dech Th√©venot wrote The Art of Swimming, describing a breaststroke very similar to the modern breaststroke. This book was translated into English and became the standard reference of swimming for many years to come. In 1793, GutsMuths from Schnepfenthal, Germany, wrote Gymnastik f√ºr die Jugend (Exercise for youth), including a significant portion about swimming. In 1794, Kanonikus Oronzio de Bernardi of Italy wrote a two volume book about swimming, including floating practice as a prerequisite for swimming studies. In 1798, GutsMuths wrote another book Kleines Lehrbuch der Schwimmkunst zum Selbstunterricht (Small study book of the art of swimming for self-study), recommending the use of a \\"fishing rod\\" device to aid in the learning of swimming. His books describe a three-step approach to learning to swim that is still used today. First, get the student used to the water; second, practice the swimming movements out of the water; and third, practice the swimming movements in the water. He believed that swimming is an essential part of every education. The Haloren, a group of salt makers in Halle, Germany, greatly advanced swimming through setting a good example to others by teaching their children to swim at a very early age.  Swimming as a competitive sport  Swimming emerged as a competitive sport in the early 1800s in England. In 1828, the first indoor swimming pool, St George's Baths, was opened to the public. By 1837, the National Swimming Society was holding regular swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools, built around London. The sport grew in popularity and by 1880, when the first national governing body, the Amateur Swimming Association, was formed, there were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across the country. Les Nageurs (The Swimmers), from the series Le Supreme Bon Ton, c. 1810‚Äì1815. In 1844 a swimming competition was held in London with the participation of two Native Americans. The British competitor used the traditional breaststroke, while the Native Americans swam a variant of the front crawl, which had been used by people in the Americas for generations, but was not known to the British. The winning medal went to 'Flying Gull' who swam the 130-foot length in 30 seconds ‚Äì the Native American swimming method proved to be a much faster style than the British breaststroke. The Times of London reported disapprovingly that the Native American stroke was an unrefined motion with the arms \\"like a windmill\\" and the chaotic and unregulated kicking of the legs. The considerable splashing that the stroke caused was deemed to be barbaric and \\"un-European\\" to the British gentlemen, who preferred to keep their heads over the water. Subsequently, the British continued to swim only breaststroke until 1873. The British did, however, adapt the breaststroke into the speedier sidestroke, where the swimmer lies to one side; this became the more popular choice by the late 1840s. In 1895, J. H. Thayers of England swam in a record-breaking 1:02.50 using a sidestroke. Sir John Arthur Trudgen picked up the hand-over stroke from South American natives he observed swimming on a trip to Buenos Aires. On his return to England in 1868, he successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873 and won a local competition in 1875. Although the new stroke was really the reintroduction of a more intuitive method for swimming, one that had been in evidence in ancient cultures such as Ancient Assyria, his method revolutionized the state of competitive swimming ‚Äì his stroke is still regarded as the most powerful to use today. In his stroke, the arms were brought forward, alternating, while the body rolled from side to side. The kick was a scissors kick such as that familiarly used in breaststroke, with one kick for two arm strokes, although it is believed that the Native Americans had indeed used a flutter kick. Front crawl variants used different ratios of scissor kicks to arm strokes, or alternated with a flutter (up-and- down) kick. The speed of the new stroke was demonstrated by F.V.C. Lane in 1901, swimming in 1:00.0, an improvement of about ten seconds compared to the breaststroke record. Due to its speed the Trudgen became very quickly popular around the world, despite all the ungentleman-like splashing. Webb and Bill Burgess across the English Channel, in 1875 and 1911, respectively. Captain Matthew Webb was the first man to swim the English Channel (between England and France), in 1875. He used breaststroke, swimming in 21 hours and 45 minutes. His feat was not replicated or surpassed for the next 36 years, until Bill Burgess made the crossing in 1911. Other European countries also established swimming federations; Germany in 1882, France in 1890 and Hungary in 1896. The first European amateur swimming competitions were in 1889 in Vienna. The world's first women's swimming championship was held in Scotland in 1892. Nancy Edberg popularized women's swimming in Stockholm from 1847. She made swimming lessons accessible for both genders and later introduced swimming lessons for women in Denmark and Norway. Idun (1890): Nr 15 (121) Her public swimming exhibitions from 1856 with her students were likely among the first public exhibitions of women swimming in Europe In 1897, Capt. Henry Sheffield designed a rescue can or rescue cylinder, now well known as the lifesaving device. The pointed ends made it slide faster through the water, although it can cause injuries.  Olympic era  Alfr√©d Haj√≥s, swimmer who won the first Olympic Gold medal. The Olympic Games were held in 1896 in Athens, a male-only competition. Six events were planned for the swimming competition, but only four events were actually contested: 100 m, 500 m, and 1200 m freestyle and 100 m for sailors. The first gold medal was won by Alfr√©d Haj√≥s of Hungary in the 100 m freestyle. Haj√≥s was also victorious in the 1200 m event, and was unable to compete in the 500 m, which was won by Austrian Paul Neumann. The second Olympic games in Paris in 1900 featured 200 m, 1000 m, and 4000 m freestyle, 200 m backstroke, and a 200 m team race (see also Swimming at the 1900 Summer Olympics). There were two additional unusual swimming events (although common at the time): an obstacle swimming course in the Seine river (swimming with the current), and an underwater swimming race. The 4000 m freestyle was won by John Arthur Jarvis in under one hour, the longest Olympic swimming race until the 10k marathon swim was introduced in 2008. The backstroke was also introduced to the Olympic Games in Paris, as was water polo. The Osborne Swimming Club from Manchester beat club teams from Belgium, France and Germany quite easily. The Trudgen stroke was improved by Australian-born Richmond Cavill. Cavill, whose father Frederick Cavill narrowly failed to swim the English Channel, is credited with developing the stroke after observing a young boy from the Solomon Islands. Cavill and his brothers spread the Australian crawl to England, New Zealand and America. Richmond used this stroke in 1902 at an International Championships in England to set a new world record by out swimming all Trudgen swimmers over the in 0:58.4(References: Davis and E.S.

These games differentiated between breaststroke and freestyle, so that there were now two defined styles (breaststroke and backstroke) and freestyle, where most people swam Trudgen. These games also featured a competition to plunge for distance, where the distance without swimming, after jumping in a pool, was measured. The Salt Lake Tribune featuring Duke Kahanamoku in 1913. In 1908, the world swimming association F√©d√©ration Internationale de Natation Amateur (FINA) was formed. Women were first allowed to swim in the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, competing in freestyle races. In the 1912 games, Harry Hebner of the United States won the 100 m backstroke. At these games Duke Kahanamoku from Hawaii won the 100 m freestyle, having learned the six kicks per cycle front crawl from older natives of his island. This style is now considered the classical front crawl style. The men's competitions were 100 m, 400 m, and 1500 m freestyle, 100 m backstroke, 200 m and 400 m breaststroke, and four by 200 m freestyle relay. The women's competitions were 100 m freestyle and four by 100 m freestyle relay. The Deutsche Lebens-Rettungs-Gesellschaft (DLRG) (German lifesaving organization) was established on October 19, 1913 in Leipzig after 17 people drowned while trying to board the cruise steamer Kronprinz Wilhelm. In the same year the first elastic swimsuit was made by the sweater company Jantzen. In 1922, Johnny Weissmuller became the first person to swim the 100 m in less than a minute, using a six kicks per cycle Australian crawl. Johnny Weissmuller started the golden age of swimming, winning five Olympic medals and 36 national championships and never losing a race in his ten-year career, until he retired from swimming and started his second career starring as Tarzan in film. His record of 51 seconds in freestyle stood for over 17 years. In the same year, Sybil Bauer was the first woman to break a men's world record over the 440 m backstroke in 6:24.8. At the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, lane dividers made of cork were used for the first time, and lines on the pool bottom aided with orientation.  Swimming innovation  Graphic data for World Record Progression in Men and Women Swimming 50m-100m-200m Long and Short Course Butterfly-Backstroke-Breaststroke-Freestyle The scientific study of swimming began in 1928 with David Armbruster, a coach at the University of Iowa, who filmed swimmers underwater. The Japanese also used underwater photography to research the stroke mechanics, and subsequently dominated the 1932 Summer Olympics. Armbruster also researched a problem of breaststroke where the swimmer was slowed down significantly while bringing the arms forward underwater. In 1934 Armbruster refined a method to bring the arms forward over water in breaststroke. While this \\"butterfly\\" technique was difficult, it brought a great improvement in speed. One year later, in 1935, Jack Sieg, a swimmer also from the University of Iowa developed a technique involving swimming on his side and beating his legs in unison similar to a fish tail, and modified the technique afterward to swim it face down. Armbruster and Sieg combined these techniques into a variant of the breaststroke called butterfly with the two kicks per cycle being called dolphin fishtail kick. Using this technique Sieg swam in 1:00.2. However, even though this technique was much faster than regular breaststroke, the dolphin fishtail kick violated the rules and was not allowed. Therefore, the butterfly arms with a breaststroke kick were used by a few swimmers in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin for the breaststroke competitions. In 1938, almost every breaststroke swimmer was using this butterfly style, yet this stroke was considered a variant of the breaststroke until 1952, when it was accepted as a separate style with a set of rules. Around that time another modification to the backstroke became popular. Previously, the arms were held straight during the underwater push phase, for example by the top backstroke swimmer from 1935 to 1945, Adolph Kiefer. However, Australian swimmers developed a technique where the arms are bent under water, increasing the horizontal push and the resulting speed and reducing the wasted force upward and sideways. This style is now generally used worldwide. In 1935 topless swimsuits for men were worn for the first time during an official competition. In 1943, the US ordered the reduction of fabric in swimsuits by 10% due to wartime shortages, resulting in the first two piece swimsuits. Shortly afterwards the bikini was invented in Paris by Louis Reard (officially) or Jacques Heim (earlier, but slightly larger). Another modification was developed for breaststroke. In breaststroke, breaking the water surface increases the friction, reducing the speed of the swimmer. Therefore, swimming underwater increases the speed. This led to a controversy at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, and six swimmers were disqualified as they repeatedly swam long distances underwater between surfacing to breathe. The rule was changed to require breaststroke to be swum at the surface starting with the first surfacing after the start and after each turn. However, one Japanese swimmer, Masaru Furukawa, circumvented the rule by not surfacing at all after the start, but swimming as much of the lane under water as possible before breaking the surface. He swam all but 5 m under water for the first three 50 m laps, and also swam half under water for the last lap, winning the gold medal. The adoption of this technique led to many swimmers suffering from oxygen starvation or even some swimmers passing out during the race due to a lack of air, and a new breaststroke rule was introduced by FINA, additionally limiting the distance that can be swum under water after the start and every turn, and requiring the head to break the surface every cycle. The 1956 Games in Melbourne also saw the introduction of the flip turn, a sort of tumble turn to faster change directions at the end of the lane. In 1972, another famous swimmer, Mark Spitz, was at the height of his career. During the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he won seven gold medals. Shortly thereafter in 1973, the first swimming world championship was held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia by the FINA. Breaking the water surface reduces the speed in swimming. The swimmers Daichi Suzuki (Japan) and David Berkoff (America) used this for the 100 m backstroke at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Berkoff swam 33 m of the first lane completely underwater using only a dolphin kick, far ahead of his competition. A sports commentator called this a Berkoff Blastoff. Suzuki, having practiced the underwater technique for 10 years, surfaced only a little bit earlier, winning the race in 55.05. At that time, this was not restricted by FINA backstroke rules. The backstroke rules were quickly changed in the same year by the FINA to ensure the health and safety of the swimmers, limiting the underwater phase after the start to ten meters, which was expanded to 15 m in 1991. In Seoul, Kristin Otto from East Germany won six gold medals, the most ever won by a woman. Another innovation is the use of flip turns for backstroke. According to the rules, a backstroke swimmer had to touch the wall while lying less than 90 degrees out of the horizontal. Some swimmers discovered that they could turn faster if they rolled almost 90 degrees sideways, touched the wall, and made a forward tumble turn, pushing off the wall on their backs. The FINA has changed the rules to allow the swimmers to turn over completely before touching the wall to simplify this turn and to improve the speed of the races. Similarly, the dolphin-kick underwater swimming technique is now also used for butterfly. Consequently, in 1998 FINA introduced a rule limiting swimmers to 15 meters underwater per lap before they must surface. After underwater swimming for freestyle and backstroke, the underwater swimming technique is now also used for butterfly, for example by Denis Pankratov (Russia) or Angela Kennedy (Australia), swimming large distances underwater with a dolphin kick. FINA is again considering a rule change for safety reasons. It is faster to do butterfly kick underwater for the first few meters off the wall than swimming at the surface. In 2005, FINA declared that you may take 1 underwater dolphin kick in the motion of a breaststroke pull-out. Sophisticated bodyskins were banned from FINA competitions from the start of 2010 after many national swimming federations demanded the action, and leading athletes such as Michael Phelps and Rebecca Adlington criticized the suits.

Cast and Kristin Cast. Zoey's soul has shattered and while her friends search through Kramisha's prophetic poems to bring her back Stevie Rae has to step in her shoes and hold the House of Night together while dealing with her own secrets. Plot Isle of Sgiach Stark, Darius and Aphrodite follow the clues in Kramisha's prophetic poems and take Zoey's body to the Isle of Sgiach to find a way of getting Zoey back. They gain entrance because of Stark's being the blood relative of Seoras, the queen's Guardian (the \\"bridge of blood\\"). Together with Sgiach they decipher the rest of the poem and realize that Stark must become a Shaman to step into the Otherworld. Stark sacrifices on the altar of Seol ne Gigh and through pain he enters a trance where he kills the evil side of himself to become a Shaman. After the fight, the Black Bull leads him to the Otherworld. Otherworld Zoey meets Heath in the Otherworld and refuses to be parted from him a second time. As time passes she becomes more and more erratic. Heath feels bad as he sees her fall apart, but is powerless to stop it as Zoey herself is too afraid to accept the lost parts of her soul back. When Stark arrives, he follows Aphrodite's advice and contacts Heath first, as Zoey wouldn't leave with Heath still in the Otherworld with her. Stark argues that Zoey might still accept her soul back and stay with Heath, but Neferet would win in the real world. Realizing that Stark speaks the truth and is not motivated by jealousy anymore, Heath speaks one more time with Zoey and disappears. While Zoey stays behind, crying, Stark comes and tries to get Zoey to come back, but she is too scared. To get her to act, Stark comes out of the enchanted meadow and faces Kalona in an arena. Terrified that Stark might die too, Zoey finally calls back the fragments of her soul. Stark is temporarily distracted, and Kalona kills him. Zoey calls air and fixes him on the wall of the arena. She calls in the debt he owns her for Heath's death to save Stark, and Nyx materializes and forces Kalona to share some of his immortality with Stark before banishing him from her realm. Tulsa After having nearly burned down on a roof, Stevie Rae recovers quickly due to Rephaim's Immortal blood and their Imprint. She learns of Zoey's soul shattering and has to balance the expectations of those who would expect her to step in Zoey's shoes. She escapes her friends to talk to Rephaim and the two make a pact to help each other until Zoey or Kalona returns to her or his body. Stevie Rae follows the clues in Kramisha's poems and decides to invoke Light, materialized as one of the bulls. By wrongly presuming that Light will materialize as the white Bull, she accidentally invokes Darkness, who nonetheless gives Stark access to the Otherworld. To reach her in time, Rephaim calls unto the immortal powers of his father to heal his wing, without realizing that it's actually Darkness too, that answers. He reaches her in time and takes on her debt to Darkness, allowing the Bull to feed on his pain. To save him, Stevie Rae calls the black Bull, Light and accepts to be forever bound to Rephaim's humanity in exchange for Light's saving him. The Bulls start fighting and disappear. Dallas appears and takes a wounded Stevie Rae home. When she heals she takes the red fledglings to conquer the tunnels. On the way, Dallas discovers an affinity for the New world, electricity, and leads them to the kitchens where the renegades are gathered. Five of them die in the ensuing confrontation, but none of Stevie Rae's, because of her Earth affinity and the others flee. Stevie Rae and Dallas remain behind to finish cleaning up. Dallas kisses Stevie Rae when Rephaim finds them, alerted by the Imprint. Realizing that Stevie Rae has saved and sheltered him, Dallas lets himself be influenced by the residual Darkness left by the renegades and fights him. When Stevie Rae protects Rephaim, Dallas accepts Darkness and Changes and angrily rushes out, threatening to tell everyone at the House of Night the truth. When she finds out he has stolen her car, Stevie Rae lets Rephaim fly her to Gilcrease, where she goes to sleep. The next day, Stevie Rae calls Lenobia, to find that Dallas has never reached the House of Night, and Aphrodite, to learn that she has had a vision about her and Rephaim. Stevie Rae and Rephaim confess their feelings for each other and Nyx offers them a vision of a human Rephaim. As they look transfixed, Kalona returns to the real world, along with Zoey, and Rephaim leaves, confessing he can't turn his back on his father.

First found in 1948 as part of a University of California, Berkeley expedition, it was at first thought to be under a form of Proconsul by C.T. Madden in 1980, but after a re-examination by Meave Leakey and associates later, the fossils were moved under a new genus Kamoyapithecus, named after the renowned fossil finder Kamoya Kimeu. The genus is represented by only one species, K. hamiltoni. Morphology Kamoyapithecus is known exclusively by its teeth and jaws. The type specimen, KNM-LS 7, was a right maxillary jaw fragment found during the expedition in 1948. Through this fossil as well as more recent fragments of mandibles and teeth, it has been found that Kamoyapithecus had very large and robust anterior teeth. The incisors are found to be compressed on the sides, but expanded from top to bottom. Its teeth also have been found through plane film X-ray to not be thickly enamelled. This suggests that Kamoyapithecus had more emphasis on foods that did not involve heavy wearing, such as soft fruits, nuts and seeds. This would have been well-placed in the Late-Oligocene in Africa, when forests covered a lot of the land. Similar affinities with the jaw fragments have been seen with Afropithecus, Proconsul, and the Morotopithecus, but nothing definitive can be stated as to the relationship between these genera and Kamoyapithecus as the amount of fossil record is very limited. This variation of traits that are expressed within the fragments also makes it difficult to ascertain exactly where Kamoyapithecus fits in the evolution of humans.

Rodrigo G√≥mez (died 1146) was a Castilian nobleman and military leader under Alfonso VII. He governed large parts of Asturias and northern Castile, was involved in the politics with neighbouring Navarre, to whose royal family he was related by marriage, and took part in the Reconquista. Although he was rewarded for loyalty by his sovereign on more than one occasion, he did take part in one brief rebellion, led by a relative. His was a branch of the Lara family. Rodrigo was a son of G√≥mez Gonz√°lez and Urraca Mu√±oz.Barton, 291. He married Elvira, a daughter of the Navarrese infante Ramiro S√°nchez, sometime before 1137, when they made a joint donation of their villa (palacio in contemporary records) at Villaverde to the monastery of San Salvador de O√±a.Barton, 65. In this donation Rodrigo expressed the wish that his gift would purchase eternal life for his lord, Alfonso VII.Barton, 207. Elvira outlived her husband by several years, making another donation to O√±a on 18 February 1161 just before her departure on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The couple produced three sons, each of whom became counts: √Ålvaro, G√≥mez, and Gonzalo.Reilly, 168. According to one historian, Rodrigo first appears in royal documents in 1119, eight years after his father's death at the Battle of Candespina (1111). Another historian cites a document of 13 February 1121 in the archives of the monastery of Sahag√∫n, a favoured royal residence, as his first public appearance. After the death of Queen Urraca on 8 March 1126, Rodrigo and his brother Diego were among the first to do homage to her successor, Alfonso VII. In this connexion, they are the first Castilians listed by the Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris, which says of Rodrigo postea ab eo factus est consul (\\"later made count by him [the king]\\").Barton, 127. On 17 June 1126 Rodrigo made a donation to the Benedictine monastery of San Pedro de las Due√±as. He made many other donations to the Benedictine monastery at O√±a, both before and after his marriage (e.g. 1142). Preserved Romanesque arch from San Pedro de las Due√±as, sculpted in Rodrigo's own time. He made a donation to San Pedro in 1126. Early in Alfonso's reign Rodrigo began to accrue positions in Castile. On 13 September 1129 he was holding Cervera and Mud√° from the king. On 16 November 1129 he was recorded as holding Briviesca. After the rebellion of Rodrigo Gonz√°lez de Lara in 1130, Rodrigo G√≥mez was his replacement as governor of Asturias de Santillana, although the first charter that records him as such dates to 2 December 1131. He continued to govern that region for the rest of his life. He was also the recipient of royal largesse in October 1130.Reilly, 33. By 1 June 1131 Rodrigo had been given the title count (comes or consul), the highest dignity in the realm. At the same time he is first mentioned ruling Bureba, which he held onto until at least 25 February 1144. His son Gonzalo would also rule Bureba for most of his career. A private charter from the abbey of San Salvador de O√±a, dated to November 1129, shows Rodrigo as lord in that region. At about the same time, a royal charter of Alfonso I of Aragon and Navarre enacted at Briviesca on 10 October 1129, names Fort√∫n Garc√©s Cajal as holding the tenancy of Bureba. These two charters indicate the contested nature of this frontier district. At a local level the king of Le√≥n's man was recognised and active as tenant, but when the king of Aragon was present, his choice of tenant, in this case his most powerful magnate, was enforced.Estepa D√≠ez, 24 nn. 45 and 47. In 1132 Rodrigo supported his kinsman, Gonzalo Pel√°ez, then in revolt in western Asturias, and rapidly fell from favour. The king was assembling an army at Atienza for a war with Alfonso of Aragon and Navarre when he learned of the insurrection. He changed plans and led his army into Asturias, where he \\"seized [Rodrigo G√≥mez], and he stripped him of his honor and sent him away,\\" according to the Chronica Adefonsi (I, ¬ß30). There is some dispute whether the Rodrigo of the rebellion was the same as the count, but if he was the latter he was soon restored. He was still at court on 28 May 1132 and had already returned to favour by January 1133.Reilly, 38‚Äì39. On 19 December 1135 Rodrigo and his sisters, Sancha and Estefan√≠a, made a donation to O√±a for the sake of their late brother Diego's soul. On 21 November 1137 Alfonso VII granted Rodrigo a series of estates in gratitude for his loyal service, the events of 1132 apparently notwithstanding. By 14 September 1138 Rodrigo had been appointed governor of Belorado, a post which he held until 1144, at which time he also appeared briefly ruling Cerezo. In 1139 he participated in the Siege of Oreja throughout the summer and into the autumn.Barton, 179‚Äì80. On 22 February 1140 Rodrigo was witness to a treaty between Alfonso VII and Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona at Carri√≥n de los Condes.Barton, 140. Later that year, Rodrigo, with Gutierre Fern√°ndez de Castro and a certain Lope L√≥pez, waged war on Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez of Navarre on behalf of Alfonso VII.Barton, 174. Garc√≠a of Navarre was in fact Rodrigo's brother-in-law. By 27 January 1141 Rodrigo was recorded as ruling Castile, a reference to Castella Vetula (Old Castile) in the north of the kingdom, territory which bordered Asturias de Santillana. He continued to hold it until his death. In 1142 he was appointed tutor or guardian of Garc√≠a, the youngest son of Alfonso VII. That same year Rodrigo confirmed the donation he and Elvira had made in 1137 of their villa at Villaverde to O√±a, this time extending his hopes to include the eternal life of his ward Garc√≠a. The young Garc√≠a died in 1145. In 1144 Rodrigo and Gutierre Fern√°ndez escorted the king of Navarre, against whom they had been fighting four years previous, from Le√≥n to Pamplona with his new bride, Urraca, the daughter of Alfonso VII.Reilly, 83. The escorts were rewarded by Garc√≠a, as recounted in the Chronica Adefonsi (I, ¬ß94): > [At Pamplona] King Garc√≠a prepared a royal feast for the Castilians and for > all the knights and officers of his kingdom. The celebration lasted several > days. When it was over, the King gave magnificent gifts to the Castilian > nobles, and each of them returned to his land. The last document citing Rodrigo as ruling Asturias and Castile dates from 19 September 1146. Shortly afterwards he made his last donation to O√±a, on 21 September. The last reference to Rodrigo as still living dates to November 1146. According to the Chronicon Burgense he died that year. Surviving royal documents reveal that he spent most of his last year at court.Barton, 131.

His signature song was \\"Angry\\", which he first recorded in 1939 on Columbia Records' Vocalion label. He used sandpaper blocks and a g√ºiro to generate a double shuffle \\"beat that makes the listener itch to dance\\".Billboard Music Week November 20, 1961, page 42 Early life Hill was born in Sullivan Township (Moultrie County), Illinois. His parents were William Fred Hill (1880-1915) and Osa Crowdson Ault (1890-1982). His parents separated when he was seven years old and he went to live with an aunt. He was active in high school sports and was president of his senior class. He graduated from Sullivan High School in 1924. Hill then attended Illinois State Normal School for two years. Financial difficulties forced him to leave college to go to work. He went to Detroit where he worked in a produce warehouse. After a series of short term jobs he ended up driving a team of mules for the Midwest Canning Company in Rochelle, Illinois. His own band In 1931 Hill formed his first big band which were known as the ‚ÄúFat Man‚Äôs Band‚Äù . Hill played the drums with the trio which played for several years in and around Decatur, Illinois. In 1934 Tiny joined the Byron Dunbar band in Decatur as a drummer and vocalist. After a year with Dunbar, Hill left to form his own band, taking many of Dunbar's band members with him. They had their first appearance at the Ingleterra Ballroom in Peoria, Illinois on October 31, 1935. Members of Hill's new band were Dick Coffeen and Harold King on trumpets; John Noreuil on trombone, Jim Shielf on piano, and Reightno Corrington on bass. The reed section included Bobby Walters, Bob Kramar and Nook Schreier, who also did arranging. The group's style was Dixieland jazz and hillbilly music. Their theme song was ‚ÄúDream Girl‚Äù. By 1937 the band was playing its warm and easy-to-dance-to music three nights a week to packed audiences at the Ingleterra Ballroom. In September 1939, the band was heard over Remote WGN Radio broadcasts from the Melody Mill Ballroom in the Chicago suburb of North Riverside, Illinois. The band played for several years at the Melody Mill and acquired a large following throughout the Midwest. Augmented by vocalists such as Allen De Witt, Bob Freeman, Irwin Bendell and Hill himself, the group's popularity soon extended to Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa, growing steadily throughout the 30s and 40s. Soon the band was playing in ballrooms coast to coast. Tiny toured the country for a while and landed on the Coast to play four months at the Casino Gardens, Ocean Park, Calif. He returned to Chicago in 1942.Billboard Music Yearbook. 1943. page 158. Further appearances included Aragon and Trianon in Chicago and The Rainbow Ballroom in Denver. In 1943 Hill and his orchestra became the summer replacement band on the Lucky Strike ‚ÄúYour Hit Parade‚Äù radio show. Hill was featured on the cover of the September 23, 1944 edition of Billboard Magazine. In 1945 he was hired as Folk Music Director at Mercury Records. He was featured again on the cover of Billboard Magazine on August 4, 1945. He resigned as Country A&R; man at Mercury in March 1948. At a performance at the Trianon Ballroom, South Gate, CA, June 18, 1946, booked by MCA, the members of the orchestra consisted of:Billboard Magazine July 6, 1946 pg 37-38 *VOCALISTS: Tiny Hill, Buddy Milton, Bobby Anderson, Russ Phillips *CORNETS: Sterling Bose, Bobby Anderson *TROMBONES: Harry Taff, Russ Phillips, Jimmy James *SAXES: Buddy Walden, Bobby Walter, Vic Jaroney, Jim Turner *RHYTHM: Buddy Milton, guitar; Clarence (Penny) Pfiefer, drums; Pat Paterson, bass; Jimmy Shields, piano *ARRANGERS: Wally Fobart, Ralph Morse, Bobby Walter, Bobby Anderson Tiny and his band continued to enjoy success for many years, well into the 1950s, until the end of the big band era. Married life Hill was married three times. He was first married to Alta M. Blystone (n√©e Frederick) from Sullivan, IL. She traveled with Hill and his mother cooking meals for the band when they were on the road. On May 1, 1946 Hill married 31-year-old Jenny Lou Carson, a successful county music singer and songwriter. The couple purchased a log cabin on Naches Pass near Mount Rainier, WA in 1948. The couple had a very successful business partnership with Hill performing many of Jenny Lou's songs and eventually recording eleven of her songs including \\"Never Trust A Woman\\" in 1947 (Mercury No. 6062). Hill's mother did not like Jenny Lou and their marriage was doomed from the start. Jenny Lou filed for divorce in April 1949, it became final on July 5, 1949. On March 7, 1957 Hill married Catherine Marie Pearson (1922-1958), a native of Joplin, Missouri. Popular songs Hill's band performed in ballrooms across the country and on radio and recording such songs as \\"Angry\\", \\"Sioux City Sue\\", \\"Heartaches\\", \\"I'll Sail My Ship Alone\\", \\"Who's Sorry Now?\\", \\"Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue\\", \\"I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover\\", \\"Move It On Over\\", \\"Mockin' Bird Hill\\", If You Knew Susie, and \\"Slow Poke\\". In 1951 Hill had a hit with a cover of ‚ÄúHot Rod Race‚Äù written by George Wilson. In all, Hill made over 95 recordings on six different labels. Later years In January 1950 Hill moved to Colorado where he would spend time when not on the road. He purchased a dairy farm at Ft. Lupton named Mountain View. In 1951 the band traveled in ten months. In 1952, the band racked up in 11 months, in his fleet of Packard automobiles. Fast cars were one of Tiny's hobbies. In '51 and again in '52, the band was his guests at the Indianapolis Memorial Day Races. Another of his hobbies was cooking. In 1956, Hill opened Radio Station KHIL in Brighton, CO. He eventually spent less time on the road and more time with his business interests. Despite the ending of the Big Bands era, Hill continued to play in small combos in the Denver- Brighton area, often returning to the Midwest for guest appearances. Undeterred by the decline in the commercial appeal of the big band sound, Hill resolutely remained at the helm of the combo until his death in 1971. His final public performance was to a capacity audience in Emden, Illinois on July 17, 1971. The inscription on his tombstone reads: ‚ÄúForgotten quickly by many, remembered forever by a few.‚Äù Today the Tiny Hill Orchestra is based in the Ozark Theatre of St. Louis. MO in the summer months and in south Texas during the winter. Performances feature the historic hit records, previously unreleased period pieces and contemporary music. The orchestra is directed by arranger and multi instrumentalist Dan Stevens.

The book was finished shortly before his death in January 1973 and published posthumously.Publisher's Note: It was published in English, then translated to at least fourteen languages including German,Published as Vergib mir Natascha. Spanish,Published as El Esbirro. French,Published as Pardonne-moi Natacha. Russian,Published as –ü—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –º–µ–Ω—è, –ù–∞—Ç–∞—à–∞. and Dutch.Published as Vergeef mij, Natasja!. Although the English versions have since ceased publication, various foreign-language versions are still in print. Background The Persecutor details Sergei Kourdakov's early life in Novosibirsk Oblast, his life as an orphan, the raids he led on private Christian assemblies while a Naval academy student in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, his defection to Canada, and his new life in Canada and the United States. The book opens with Kourdakov's escape to Canada. Beginning with the second chapter, the book flashes back to Kourdakov's childhood. Criticism The Persecutor has been met with varied criticism regarding its authorship and accuracy. Some, such as Albert W. Wardin, believe that the biography was at least partially written by members of Underground Evangelism, the Christian organization which Kourdakov was a member of that helped smuggle Bibles into communist countries. Wardin also claims that the book gives a distorted view of evangelical life in the Soviet Union, stating that \\"the allegation that for years before the late 1960s there was not even one Protestant church in Novosibirsk is untrue\\" and that \\"the figure of 30,000 Initiative Baptists in Kamthatka [...] and that of over 150 attacks in two years seems unbelievably high.\\" In 2004, United States Christian journalist Caroline Walker released a drama documentary about The Persecutor. Claiming to have been given a vision from God, she traveled to Siberia to investigate various parts of book. Through the film, she claims that contrary to her own expectations, there are many inconsistencies in the autobiography, such as the section dealing with Sergei's experience in the Barysevo Orphanage as a child. The documentary, titled Forgive Me, Sergei (a pun on the autobiography title), was co-produced and directed by Polish Jesuit Damian Wojciechowski, whom she met during her investigation. He was also attempting to film a documentary on Kourdakov's life, but was struggling with inconsistencies in the book. The documentary received multiple awards at film festivals.

Kraut (born August 30, 1946) is an American social psychologist who studies human-computer interaction, online communities, internet use, group coordination, computers in organizations, and the role of visual elements in interpersonal communication. He is a Herbert Simon Professor of Human-computer Interaction at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Background Robert Kraut graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Lehigh University in 1968 and received his Ph.D. in social psychology from Yale University in 1973. He joined the sociology faculty at the University of Pennsylvania in 1972 and moved to Cornell University in 1974. In 1980, Kraut joined Bell Labs as a visiting scientist and departed Cornell in 1981 to become a full-time scientist working in Bell's Interface Planning group. Following the 1984 Bell System divestiture, he worked in the Behavioral Science research group at Bell Communications Research (Bellcore) and later became the director of the Interpersonal Communication research. During his tenure at Bell, Kraut was also a visiting lecturer and fellow at Princeton University. In 1993, Kraut left Bellcore and accepted a full-time faculty appointment at Carnegie Mellon University as a professor of social psychology and human computer interaction. Kraut was named the Herbert A. Simon Professor of Human-computer Interaction in 2000. He was elected to the CHI Academy in 2003. He is board member of the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the US National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Psychological Society and of the Association for Computing Machinery (2011). Research Kraut's research focuses on five areas: online communities, everyday use of the Internet, technology and conversation, collaboration in small work groups, and computers in organizations. He has published more than 100 articles, papers and books. He first examines the challenges that individuals, groups, and organizations face when performing social tasks. Working with computer scientists and engineers to create and determine the usefulness of the new technology, he believes his findings can lead to the design of new technology to meet some of these challenges. Online Communities His most recent work examines factors influencing the success of online communities and ways to apply psychology theory to their design. This includes academic studies about wikipedia, for example, research with Aniket Kittur on the condition that lead to better quality in wikipedia articles and with Moira Burke in predicting successful candidates for wikipedia administrators. Kraut focuses on determining what motivates people to commit and contribute to online communities and designing these communities to be more successful. He also works with Niki Kittur to understand coordination in online communities, with John Levine to understand socialization between newcomers and these communities, and with Laura Dabbish and Tom Postmes to design for commitment purposes. The results of much of this research are summarized in the book, Building Successful Online Communities: Evidence-Based Social Design. Everyday use of the Internet Kraut investigates how people use the Internet daily and the effects it is having on them and their social relationships. In 1995, Kraut and Sara Kiesler documented individuals and families‚Äô usage with electronic communication and information services and the integration of and the impact these services are having on their social and psychological well-being. Recently with Jonathon Cummings and Irina Shklovski, Kraut has looked into how people who are moving around to different locations use the Internet to build and maintain social connections. He also worked with Moira Burke and examined how various uses of Facebook influence users‚Äô social capital, health, and psychological well- being. Technology and conversation Since 1979, Kraut has been examining how pairs coordinate their conversation because it has been shown that working in the same location enhances collaboration, which improves communication efficiency. Recently, he, Susan R. Fussell, Susan Brennan, and Darren Gergle are looking into how a shared visual space influences collaboration, how the usefulness of visual information interacts with tasks, and identify ways to build communication systems for remote collaborative work. Managing Attention Economic markets are the social institution for fairly allocating scarce resources. In this area of research, Kraut wants to find out how to align the intuition that markets for attention with those who are sending and receiving the information. He also wants to be able to test the markets. Kraut has been working with Jim Morris, Shyam Sunder, and Rahul Telang on this research. They acknowledged that groups can only collaborate effectively if they are communicating spontaneously and informally. However, interruptions may cause them to be less productive. Laura Dabbish and Kraut are working towards finding ways to manage interruptions more efficiently in order to decrease disruption. In 1979, Dr. Kraut and his Cornell psychology colleague Robert E. Johnston published an article studying smiling behavior among bowlers, hockey fans, and pedestrians. Their findings suggested that smiling emerges in response to social motivations rather than emotional experience and serves an important role in nonverbal communication. Although it substantiated theories in the emerging field of evolutionary psychology, Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire identified this federally sponsored research as an instance of wasteful government spending and highlighted it in March 1980 with a \\"Golden Fleece Award\\".Nell Greenfieldboyce, 'Shrimp On A Treadmill': The Politics Of 'Silly' Studies, NPR, August 23, 2011 Coordination in groups Performing the same task as a group is inherently different than individuals doing so because coordination is needed when working with others. Working with Susan Fussell, Javier Lerch, and Alberto Espinosa, Kraut has been observing coordination in groups in laboratory and field settings as well as in a variety of groups, including research collaborations, managerial teams, military crews at NORAD, pick up groups in World of Warcraft, and software development teams. They found that one effective method teams use to coordinate is developing mental models of one another, their goals, the tasks that need to be done, and their environment. Such models improve coordination with less communication. Curriculum Outside of his research, Kraut is also currently teaching undergraduate, masters, and PhD courses at Carnegie Mellon University. His recent classes include the following: Communication in Groups and Organizations, Computer Supported Cooperative Work: Designing Online Communities, Social Science Perspectives in HCI, HCI Process and Theory, and HCI Undergraduate Project Course. His objective in Communication in Groups and Organizations is to help students learn about the communication challenges that come with group work and how to effectively resolved them. Students can better understand successful communication by applying data gathering and research principles in case studies and group exercises. His class Computer Supported Cooperative Work: Designing Online Communities is intended to provide knowledge for his students to distinguish between effective and ineffective online communities and the skills to design effective ones. Social Science Perspectives in HCI is a seminar-style course that covers not only the history of human-computer interaction, but also innovative findings in information systems. Through readings, he discusses different approaches in research and addresses the challenges that researchers face in this field of study. HCI Process and Theory and the HCI Undergraduate Project Course are research-based classes where Kraut engage in semester-long projects with a group of students. His former courses also include the HCI Masters‚Äô Project Course and The Social Web. Publications Dr. Kraut has co-authored a number of books relating to the intersection of technology and the social sciences (often under the Human-Computer Interaction umbrella throughout his career. Books  * :Dr. Kraut collaborated with Malcolm Brynin and Sara Kiesler to write Computers, Phones, and the Internet. The book focuses on understanding the impact of increasing mass access to information in contexts outside of the workplace. Specifically, the authors focus on the effects new technology has on social contexts including family dynamics, educational settings, social relationships, and daily routines. * :Dr. Kraut‚Äôs most recent book, Building Successful Online Communities is a collaboration with Dr. Paul Resnick at the University of Michigan. The book draws on theory and empirical research to give a broad understanding of what causes online communities to succeed or fail. Kraut and Resnick segment the book into a variety of design claims focused on how to improve the design of online communities. These claims are supported by evidence from academic research in the social sciences, namely psychology and economics. :A major theme of Building Successful Online Communities centers on what it means to be a successful online community. Some common themes of success involve the ability to attract newcomers, encourage commitment and contribution, and regulate group member behavior. Specifically, Kraut and Resnick‚Äôs argue ‚Äúto be successful, online communities need the people who participate in them to contribute the resources on which the group's existence is built.‚Äù Highly cited articles  Other publications * Kraut wrote Re- engineering Social Encounters, an essay reflecting back to his research on social psychology.

At break of day, on March 21, 1784, a force of no more than 500 Apaches and Navajos attacked Spanish cavalry guards protecting a herd of livestock at the Presidio San Augustin del Tucson in southern Arizona. Battle The Spanish sentries were under the command of Ensign Don Juan Carrillo when hundreds of mounted Navajo and Apache warriors attacked their position which guarded a livestock pen. The Apaches and Navajos were attempting to steal some of the cavalry garrison's horses but they had soldiers to deal with. The herd was halted in the corral, which was defended efficiently by Ensign Carillo's squad. However, the natives succeeded, after a long time, in stampeding and carrying off the herd, leaving five soldiers dead and one wounded while sustaining three of their own dead and an unknown number wounded. Thirteen horses were captured from the presidio. Immediately afterwards two additional soldiers arrived to give notice of what had happened. Without loss of time, a number of troops mounted themselves and followed the natives' trail of retreat. Aftermath The Catalina Mountains. Under the orders of Lieutenant Tom√°s Equrrola, reinforced with thirty Pima scouts from the neighboring towns of Tupson and San Xavier. This force consisted of forty-nine men, including the Pima scouts and five citizens. With the rest of the remount herd guard which consisted of twelve men. The Spanish and Pima force left Tucson and after only forty-five minutes, caught up with the Navajos and Apaches at the base of the Catalina Mountains, next to the Catalina River. Another battle began and Lieutenant Equrrola's men killed fourteen warriors, among them the native commander, Chief Chiquito.

The complex was founded by the Ayyub sultan As-Salih Ayyub in 1242 and his mausoleum was added to it by Shajarr ad-Durr upon his death in 1249. It was one of the most prominent centers of Islamic learning in the Ayyubid and Mamluk era in the 13th‚Äì14th centuries CE. Its remains are located on al-Muizz Street in the historic district of Cairo across from the Complex of Sultan Qalawun. History Interior of the mausoleum In the 13th century, the Ayyubid dynasty founded by Saladin ruled Egypt and the neighboring lands. In 1242, the sultan at the time, as-Salih Ayyub, built the Salihiyya Madrasa (named after him). It became the first madrasa (\\"religious college\\") in Cairo to teach all four of Sunni Islam's madhabs (\\"schools of law\\"). The northern wing of the complex was dedicated to the Shafi'i and Maliki denominations and the southern wing was dedicated to the Hanafi and Hanbali denominations. In 1249, Shajar al-Durr, as-Salih Ayyub's widow, had a mausoleum for as-Salih built adjacent to his madrasa. This established a medieval Islamic tradition of burying the patron in the religious institution he or she founded.Yeomans, p. 118. The Salihiyya Madrasa trained Sunni faqih (judges or experts in jurisprudence) and soon became known as the \\"citadel of the scholars (ulema).\\"Daly and Petry, 1998, p. 510. Historical accounts such as the map of al-Maqrizi show that there were 24 madrasas in the Ayyub Cairo. However, most of these madrasas except the Madrasa of Al-Saleh and Madrasa al-Kamil have not survived. Even a large part of the Madrasa of as-Salih has disappeared, except for a part of western iwan.ŸÖÿØÿ±ÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿµÿßŸÑÿ≠ ŸÜÿ¨ŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ ÿ£ŸäŸàÿ®. Museum with no Frontiers. Retrieved January 29, 2018. It was deserted sometime following the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Empire in the early 16th century. Architecture According to Muslim chronicler al-Maqrizi, as-Salih Ayyub had the eastern wall of the royal palace demolished in order to construct the two building complexes that made up the Salihiyya Madrasa. The two parallel wings were divided by a public passageway. Each of the wings consisted of two floors centered on open inner courts. The western portion of each wing provided student housing while the eastern halves functioned as iwans‚Äîopen vaulted halls where teaching took place. The architectural plan originated in Islamic Persia, while the iwans themselves derive from pre-Islamic Persia. Although the Salihiyya Madrasa was not the first madrasa to introduce the iwan court to Egypt, it is the oldest surviving structure of its type in the country. Its plan played a significant role in Cairo's later architecture.Yeomans, 2006, p. 116. Today, there are no remains of the southern wing except for the facade. Few parts of the northern wing, namely the iwan, still stand. This iwan was dedicated to the Maliki denomination. The larger qibla iwan which is no longer intact had three mihrabs and was dedicated to Shafi'i denomination. Because of the issue of reconciling already-built thoroughfares with the traditional need to align the primary structures with Mecca, the building plan was asymmetrical.Yeomans, 2006, pp. 117-118. The building's exterior is currently covered by shops, with only the minaret and parts of the central facade visible from the street.Yeomans, 2006, p.117. The Salihiyya Madrasa broke the Ayyubid tradition of only adding minarets to Friday mosques to call Muslims to prayer in that mosque.Daly and Petry, 1998, p. 372. The madrasa's minaret is positioned directly over the entrance of the madrasa. The structure has two shafts topped by ribbed helmet domes divided by a balcony and is known as a mabkhara (\\"incense burner.\\") The lower shaft is rectangular and on each of its sides are three tall, recessed, keel-arched panels with ribbed hoods. Its upper shaft is octagonal in shape and also with keel-arched panels. Unlike its lower counterpart, however, it is a more open structure filled with lobe- arched windows. The bases of the minaret's domes are decorated by two bands of muqarnas.

The tower was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. It has since been demolished, and was delisted in 2020. Description The round, red brick tower was tall with a base diameter of that tapered to at its top. The bricks used for the tower were made in Benson's own brickyard. The tower was topped by a tall redwood water tank; steel bands held the tank's wooden planks together. The tank held 15,000 barrels of water when full and was connected to the ground by a diameter supply pipe. Ladders allowed access to both the inside and outside of the tower, and a catwalk surrounded the barrel. History Replacement water tower The village of Benson experienced major fires in its business district in 1884 and 1889, hindering its development as a commercial center. In response, citizens petitioned the village for improved fire protection, and the village commissioned the water tower in 1891. Fitchen Brothers Construction built the tower for $6,400, or approximately $ in present-day terms.Inflation automatically calculated The new water tower led to economic and population growth in the village as new houses and businesses received a steady water supply from the tower. The tower also provided water to farms in the surrounding area, who transported water from the city to supplement their wells, as well as to steam trains on the Chicago, Pekin and Southwestern Railroad.

It was built in 1895 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 16, 1972. It is located on the grounds of the Kalamazoo Regional Psychiatric Hospital. History The Kalamazoo Regional Psychiatric Hospital was founded in 1859 and soon became a landmark in American medicine. Buildings on the grounds were Thomas Kirkbride and Samuel Sloan, nationally renowned hospital architects. The buildings they designed were reminiscent of medieval designs. In 1895, architect William B. Stratton from Detroit was commissioned to design a water tower on site. Stratton was instructed to come up with a structure that would complement the medieval feeling of the other buildings on the hospital grounds. Construction was completed in 1895. The tower has been struck by lightning multiple times, and the roof was eventually replaced with copper sheeting. The structure was earmarked by the State of Michigan for demolition in 1974. However, a local committee called the Committee to Save the Tower launched a campaign to raise public funds to restore the tower. Description The tower is 175 feet tall. The base stone blocks are five feet high; above this point the tower is made of bricks. It is approximately 50 feet wide at its widest point. The outer shell tapers from six feet thick at the base to four feet at the top. The tower has three water storage tanks inside. The main tank is 40 feet high and 40 feet in diameter and can hold more than 200,000 gallons of hard water. Two smaller tanks flank the main tank and hold soft water. Above the tanks is a \\"look-out\\" structure with a steeply pitched roof covered with copper sheeting.

Overview PROBA-3 will be composed of two independent, three-axis stabilized spacecraft flying at 150 meters to one another with the ability to accurately control the attitude and separation of the two craft. Their alignment with the Sun will be maintained for 6 hours, creating ‚Ä≥artificial solar eclipse‚Ä≥ for the back satellite. The spacecraft pair will fly a highly elliptical orbit divided between periods of accurate formation flying around apogee, when payload operations will be possible, and periods of free flight. The length of the formation control period will be a trade-off involving the increasing amount of fuel needed to maintain the orbits in formation when away from apogee. The primary mission of PROBA-3 is solar coronagraphy by using the telescope on the larger of the two satellites to view the Sun's corona while the other spacecraft is maneuvered to accurately occult the disc of the Sun. As of 2015, PROBA-3 was scheduled to be launched in 2020. By 2018, the launch was delayed to the second quarter of 2021, and by 2020 delayed again to mid-2022.

P. McKenzie, a Methodist minister, in Clarksville, Texas, United States. Starting in 1841, the school grew from 16 students educated in a log cabin to over 300 students and 9 faculty members occupying four large buildings in 1854. It was the largest institution of higher education in Texas during the 1850s and 1860s. Before the American Civil War began, it trained almost all of the new Methodist ministers in the state. Unable to retain financial support after the War, Rev. McKenzie closed the school in June, 1868. He served for a year as the first president of another Methodist school, Marvin College in Waxahachie, Texas, then completely retired from church-related work. He died in Clarksville on June 20, 1881. History John Witherspoon Pettigrew McKenzie (most often abbreviated to John W. P. McKenzie) was a native of North Carolina who was admitted to the Tennessee Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1836. He was soon transferred into the Arkansas Conference, which had been established on the Texas frontier. This conference assigned John and his wife Matilda as missionaries to the people of the Choctaw Nation, who had just been removed from their homes in various Southeastern states to the Indian Territory.Jordan, Milton. \\"McKenzie College, Red River County, Texas.\\" East Texas Historical Journal. vol. 48, Issue 1, Article 7. 2010. Accessed May 5, 2019., p.13. In 1839, the conference appointed John and Matilda to the Clarksville Circuit inside the Republic of Texas. In 1836, Matilda became a teacher in the first school for girls opened in the Choctaw Nation of Indian Territory (near Shawneetown in present-day McCurtain County, Oklahoma.) Suffering from poor health, Reverend John W. P. McKenzie retired from missionary work in 1841 and moved to a plantation southwest of Clarksville, Texas. He began offering classes for local boys in his home, which he named Itinerant's Retreat. As the school grew, a separate log cabin was built. Most of the first students were receiving primary and secondary education, although the school awarded its first bachelor's degree in 1844. By 1845, the school was divided into three departments: preparatory, collegiate, and female. Four buildings were built in 1853 to accommodate the school's rapid growth. McKenzie, and most of the school's other instructors, were Methodists, but did not pressure their students who adhered to other denominations to become Methodists. For example, B. F. Fuller, a Baptist, admitted later that he was nervous about enrolling in McKenzie College and the difficulty he anticipated having there because of doctrinal differences. The experience allayed his fear. He not only continued his education there, but a few years later, still a Baptist, became a teacher at McKenzie., p.13. Always considered a Methodist institution, McKenzie's school was actually controlled by the Methodist Conference for one year, After 1860, the college formed a military department that organized all male students into companies, in which they performed daily drills. In June 1861, McKenzie cancelled the final examinations and the graduation ceremonies that normally ended the school year. By 1863, the enrollment had dropped to 33, and rose to an average of 74 for the period 1864‚Äì67. Unable to keep the institution financially independent, McKenzie and his son-in-law, Smith Ragsdale, closed it on June 25, 1868. Giving up on restoring his school, McKenzie accepted an appointment as the first president of the Church-owned Marvin College in Waxahachie, Texas, but served for only one year, 1868‚Äì9. (Marvin College closed in 1878.) McKenzie returned to Clarksville and retired. He died there early in the morning of Monday, June 20, 1881, just after his school's regular morning prayers. Student life The Handbook of Texas states that about half of the students came from the Red River area, 40 percent came from other parts of Texas and 10 percent came from Arkansas and Louisiana. The school year was 10 months long, and the cost for 10 months tuition, board, room and laundry was $180. Initially, the student body was all male. It is unclear when the first females were admitted, but Jordan notes that during the prosperous 1845-1860 period the school had two competing newspapers: The Bee, which was run by young women, and The Owl, run by young men.A third paper, The School Monthly, began publication somewhat later. The college was home to two literary societies, the Philologian Society and Dialectic Society. Female students were enrolled in the Female Department, which was supervised by the founder's wife. Their academic curriculum was substantially the same as that required for the young men, but upon graduation, they were awarded diplomas, rather than degrees. Facilities McKenzie College first opened in the fall of 1841, with 16 to 18 students at the high school or elementary levels. Classes met in a single log cabin that was by in size. By 1853‚Äì4, the school had expanded into what was described by one student as \\"... four large, multi-story buildings.\\" The McKenzie's home also served as a dormitory for young women. Two of the new buildings, named Grant and Duke, to honor their donors, became dormitories for male students. Two floors of the Main Building contained the chapel, offices, recitation rooms, laboratory, and library, as well as a book store. The third floor was used by the literary societies for their meetings, debates, and oratory., p. 15. Notable people * Martha E.

Along with ICC Full Member teams, he has coached both ICC Associate & ICC Affiliate cricket teams, during his career and was recently the head coach of South Korea during the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon who were the host nation. They achieved great success, despite having very little playing experience, taking eight wickets against the Sri Lanka national cricket team in the quarter final. Other teams who have used him include Ireland, Bermuda, Trinidad and Canada. During the 2010 Micromax ODI series against Zimbabwe, Fountain was appointed temporary head coach of Bangladesh, for the 3rd & 4th ODI's, whilst Jamie Siddons attended the birth of his 2nd child back in Australia. Bangladesh won the 3rd ODI, however the 4th was abandoned due to rain. This made Fountain the first baseball coach to achieve head coach status with an ICC full member nation cricket team, as well as being the first baseball coach to instruct an ICC full member nation cricket team (West Indies in 1998). In March 2012 Fountain was re-appointed as Specialist Fielding Coach for Pakistan, and was based at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore, Pakistan. He worked exclusively with Pakistan cricketers at Test, ODI & T20 matches and was able to raise the standard of fielding significantly during his two-year tenure, which saw Pakistan win the 2012 Asia Cup and achieve both ODI & T20 success against Sri Lanka, India and South Africa. In January 2015 Fountain launched a project called Switch Hit 20 designed to help former professional baseball players transition into T20 cricketers. This coincided with him accepting an invitation from the American Cricket Federation (ACF) to join their Honorary Advisory Board, where he joins existing HAB members Arjuna Ranatunga, Ian Chappell, Clive Lloyd, Shaun Pollock, Michael Holding, Stuart MacGill, Damien Martyn, Nathan Bracken, Alvin Kallicharran, Niall O'Brien, Vince Adams, Ian Pont and Stephen Rooke.  Playing career Cricket Fountain started his cricket career as a medium pace all rounder (he later switched to wicket keeping due to his passion for fielding) for Somerset within their youth development teams. He was selected to play in the Somerset Under 19 team aged only 15 due to an injury to the regular wicket keeper. Due to personal reasons, Fountain left Somerset at the end of the season in 1987. Baseball In need of a fresh challenge, he decided to take up baseball, having watched the 1987 World Series between the Minnesota Twins and the St. Louis Cardinals. In July 1988 Fountain was selected to represent Great Britain U19 Baseball Team at the European Championships in Bordeaux, France, having only played baseball for six months. The following year he made his debut for the full Great Britain National Baseball Team, still aged only 19. He represented Great Britain, as part of the British Olympic Squad in the European Baseball Championships in 1989 in Paris, France and again in 1991 in Rome, Italy. Fountain represented Great Britain as a pitcher between 1988 and 2002. In 1989, Fountain played as part of the British Olympic Baseball Team versus an MLBPA ‚Äì Major League Players Alumni Legends team at Old Trafford Cricket Ground. The Legends team was composed of household names Bert Campaneris, Doug DeCinces, Bob Feller, Mark Fidrych, Tim Foli, George Foster, Jerry Grote, Mike Hargrove, Tug McGraw, Graig Nettles, Lary Sorensen, Willie Stargell, Rennie Stennett, Luis Tiant, Roy White, Billy Williams, Al Oliver. During this period he also attended several professional tryouts with Major League Baseball teams including the Kansas City Royals, Chicago White Sox and New York Mets. He approached a number of US universities, with the intention of taking up a scholarship, however due to a lack of additional funding, was unable to take up any of the offers, instead opting to continue playing in the UK whilst attending Thames Valley University in London. Unfortunately, due to university & work commitments, he was unable to continue his Olympic baseball career. In 2002, he was recalled to the Great Britain Baseball Team, to add strength and experience to their pitching staff during a qualification tournament in Stockholm, Sweden. England youth teams & County Cricket In 1996, having returned to his home town of Taunton, he was approached by the British Baseball Federation to assist with a cricket course run by the NCA or National Cricket Association which is now known as the England and Wales Cricket Board. He was immediately recognised by local participants as a former Somerset County youth cricketer, and was bombarded with questions about how baseball skills transfer into cricket.

During his tenure he oversaw the development of exciting new talent such as Dwayne Bravo and Devon Smith.

It was during this tour that Fountain had to put his money where his mouth was when, due to a large number of injuries, he had to take to the field as West Indies Substitute Fielder (12th Man) during the Prime Minister's Xl fixture at the Manuka Oval, Canberra. He rose to the challenge by running out Anthony McGuire with a direct hit from the boundary. He was also required as Substitute Fielder (12th Man) against Australia 'A' in Hobart, Tasmania. South Africa's Tour of West Indies 2001 In 2001, following the tour of Australia, he returned with the team to the Caribbean for the home series against South Africa. This series saw Fountain's involvement diminished, despite the benefits which were definitely showing. This led to allegations of underhand treatment of Fountain and other management members by the WICB.\\"Ricky Skerritt Interview\\" Caribbeancricket.com retrieved 30 July 2010 Pakistan 'A' Team Tour of Sri Lanka 2001 After parting company with the West Indies due to contractual difficulties, Fountain was approached by the Pakistan Cricket Board to act as assistant and specialist coach for the Pakistan A cricket team \\"Pakistan A to leave for Sri Lanka on 10th June\\" Cricinfo retrieved 3 November 2009 on their tour of Sri Lanka\\"It's captains' day as Hasan Raza defies Sri Lanka A\\" Cricinfo retrieved 3 November 2009 under head coach Mudassar Nazar, an appointment which was seen as \\"clearly necessary\\".\\"Gunawardene century saves Sri Lanka from freefall\\" Cricinfo retrieved 3 November 2009 Upon completing the Sri Lanka tour, Fountain accompanied the team back to Pakistan where he was tasked with holding Elite Coaching Clinics at all the major academies including Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Rawalpindi. He attended a week-long camp in Karachi under the guidance of head coach Richard Pybus with the senior Pakistan national cricket team working with the players prior to their upcoming home series. He also held a series of clinics for Pakistan coaches at each of the venues. Upon returning to the UK, due to his absence from the ECB system, his unofficial role as ECB fielding coach had been filled by various former players including Trevor Penney and Gary Palmer, and consequently he fell out of favour with the governing body. Despite making a huge contribution to the improved way fielding was taught in professional cricket,\\"Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blue\\" ECB retrieved 3 November 2009 he was unable to further his coaching career despite achieving all the relevant coaching qualifications and even becoming a tutor on ECB Courses. Director of Cricket, Pangbourne College 2002 In 2002, Fountain took up a pastoral position at Pangbourne College in Berkshire which allowed him to expand his coaching experience in the role of director of cricket and head coach. Whilst fulfilling this role he also gained valuable experience teaching physical education and coaching Hockey. Pakistan tour of England 2006 In 2006, having both grown as a coach and gained valuable coaching experience, he was hired by Bob Woolmer to act as specialist fielding coach for the Pakistan national cricket team on their tour of England. During the tour his role as specialist fielding coach was reduced to allow greater input into the team's batting performance. He was used extensively by both junior and senior players such as Inzamam-ul-Haq, Younis Khan, Mohammad Yousuf and Shahid Afridi as a one-to-one batting coach. He was in the Pakistan dressing room at The Oval on that fateful day in August 2006 when the infamous alleged \\"Ball tampering\\" incident occurred. England 'A' & ECB National Academy 2006/07 Over the winter of 2006/2007, with this new-found international experience and exposure, Fountain was hired by Peter Moores, the ECB national academy director at the time, to work with England 'A' Team players, England youth team players, National Skill Set and Regional Skill Set Players.\\"Chance to train with England A\\" ECB retrieved 3 November 2009 West Indies Tour of England 2007 In 2007 the West Indies cricket team were touring England and the new head coach David Moore, on the recommendation of the senior players, requested Fountain's assistance \\"Digicel funds fielding coach for windies england tour\\" retrieved 3 November 2009 as a specialist fielding coach for the remainder of the NPower Test Series and the ODI / T20 series.

This tenure was one of his proudest moments in coaching as not only did England U16 sweep the series against Australia U16, without losing a game, but finally he gained recognition as a coach in his own right capable of coaching all aspects of cricket, not simply fielding. It was also at this time that he achieved another seemingly unattainable milestone by coaching England T20 specialist players at the National Performance Centre, prior to their departure to South Africa for the T20 Cricket World Cup. Pro Batter Video Simulator Pitching Machines Whilst at the National Performance Centre in September 2007, Fountain, after a recent research trip to the US, brought the concept of using the Pro Batter Video Simulator Pitching Machine for cricket to the attention of Peter Moores and David Parsons. He introduced the company, Pro Batter Sports, to the England & Wales Cricket Board and in 2010 Pro Batter completed the installation of two units at the National Performance Centre at Loughborough.\\"ICC install pro batter machines at global academy\\" Retrieved 15 March 2011 It was not until Dene Hills, an Australian Cricket Coach, joined the ECB in late 2008, as batting coach, that they finally got in touch with Pro Batter regarding the possibility of using the machines for cricket; something Fountain had identified over a year before.\\"Fountain Disappointed with ECB betrayal\\" Retrieved 16 March 2011 Stanford T20 Cricket, 2007 & 2008 Stanford Professional Franchise Teams Late 2007 Fountain was contacted by the Stanford T20 Cricket organisation, who had established professional teams in Antigua, Nevis, St Lucia and Anguilla. He spent a few weeks not only assessing and coaching these newly formed professional teams, but conducting a complete audit of each organisation, looking at coaching, facilities, players and every aspect of their day-to-day operations. It was also at this time, and following the guidelines of the McLaurin Report, that England decided that they should hire a full-time fielding coach and despite his long standing involvement with the ECB, going back over 10 years, and his extensive international resume, which at that time had three full international teams and countless worldwide professional teams on it, was pipped to the post by part-time cricket coach, PE Teacher and Director of Sport at Wellington College Richard Halsall who was more familiar to the newly appointed England Head coach, Peter Moores, due to his link with Sussex County Cricket Club .\\"Parsons named performance director\\" ECB retrieved 3 November 2009 Stanford Superstars In 2008, the Stanford relationship was to prove crucial, as Fountain was again hired by Stanford T20 Cricket, to be the official fielding coach for the newly formed Stanford Superstars professional cricket team.\\"Stanford Superstars to hold training camp\\" Cricinfo retrieved 3 November 2009 The Stanford Superstars were formed with the intention of playing a one off Twenty Million Dollar Game against England at the Stanford Cricket Ground in Antigua on 1 November 2008, which is incidentally, Antigua's Independence Day.

Zahorchak is an American educator and the former Secretary of Education for the Pennsylvania Department of Education, a position he held from 2006 to 2010. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Zahorchak worked at various Pennsylvania public school districts in a number of positions, including teacher, football coach, principal, federal programs director, strategic planning coordinator and personnel director. Zahorchak worked as superintendent of the Greater Johnstown School District in Cambria County from 1997 to 2003, when he was chosen to be Deputy Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education for the state. Governor Ed Rendell appointed him Secretary of Education in 2005. During his tenure as secretary, Zahorchak implemented state funding for pre-kindergarten and full-day kindergarten, developed a new school funding formula, helped increase education funding for school districts, and established the Keystone Exams and the state's Standards Aligned System. In 2010, Zahorchak announced he would leave the Secretary of Education position, coinciding with Rendell's pending departure from the governorship. On April 22, 2010, Zahorchak was selected to be superintendent of the Allentown School District in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where he vowed to establish regular updates to families about their students education, improve safety in schools and implement incentives to attract qualified minorities and top education students into teaching positions. Early career Gerald Zahorchak received his doctorate in education from Pennsylvania State University. A native of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Zahorchak received a bachelor's degree master in 1980 from Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania, and a master of education degree from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1986. In 1994, Zahorchak received his doctorate in education from Pennsylvania State University, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation on state policy-making. Zahorchak began his educational career in 1980 at the Greater Johnstown School District in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, where he spent two years an elementary school teacher. In 1985, he became a middle school reading and language arts in the North Star School District in Somerset County, where he also coached varsity high school football. Zahorchak taught at North Star until 1989, when he started working at the Shanksville- Stonycreek School District, also in Somerset County. During his three years in the district, he worked as an elementary and secondary principal, as well as a federal programs director. In 1992, he returned to the North Star School District as a principal and strategic planning coordinator. Zahorchak also previously served as an elected member of the Greater Johnstown School Board, and was a Johnstown city councilman, the Johnston deputy major and president of the Johnstown Rotary in 2003. Zahorchak returned to the Greater Johnstown School District in 1996 as a federal programs and personnel director. In 1997, he was promoted to superintendent, a position he held for six years. During his tenure as superintendent, Zahorchak implemented full-day kindergarten, pre-kindergarten and tutoring programs. He also pursued high school reform and hired reading and math coaches to boost student learning. Early state career In March 2003, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Vicki Phillips hired Zahorchak as Deputy Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education, where he oversaw the education of more than 1.8 million children public school children in the state. Zahorchak helped implement the release of Pennsylvania's first Academic Achievement Reports, and led the development and implementation of support systems for public schools trying to meet No Child Left Behind targets. By 2005, Zahorchak was making a yearly salary of $124,458. Zahorchak served as acting education secretary from August 2004, when Phillips left the position, to September 2004, when Francis Barnes was hired. During the Barnes administration, Governor Ed Rendell encouraged local Pennsylvania school boards to participate in Act 72, a state property tax- relief program. Act 72 used proceeds from slot-machine gambling to finance property tax cuts from homeowners, and included with spending restrictions in exchange for the tax cuts. Barnes himself did not support the program, and most school boards rejected it because of the spending restrictions. Zahorchak, however voiced support for Act 72 and helped Rendell lobby local school districts to support it, which increased his visibility statewide. Zahorchak claimed Act 72 \\"includes real property tax relief that shifts more of the responsibility for school funding back to the state\\". When Barnes resigned in September 2005, Zahorchak was again tapped to serve as acting secretary and was widely considered the most qualified candidate for the permanent position, although Governor Ed Rendell engaged in a thorough search for other potential candidates around the state. Secretary of Education Zahorchak was appointed state Secretary of Education on October 5, 2005, by Governor Ed Rendell, following the resignation of former Secretary Francis Barnes. He was considered highly regarded by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers involved in education issues. During his Pennsylvania State Senate confirmation hearing in December 2005, Zahorchak said he supported the state's $44 million Educational Improvement Tax Credit, which provides tax breaks for businesses that support public education programs and private school scholarships. Zahorchak also said he believed basic education should be the state's primary fiscal educational investment, rather than special education or higher education. The Pennsylvania State Senate Education Committee unanimously approved Zahorchak during his confirmation hearing on December 13, 2005, and the full senate unanimously confirmed him on February 7, 2006. Governor Ed Rendell (pictured) chose Gerald Zahorchak to serve as Pennsylvania Secretary of Education in 2005. Zahorchak was a steady supporter of Rendell's education proposals. However, he maintained that he could still be an independent voice within the administration, and claimed, \\"I happen to agree with the outcomes because I'm in the mix of making determinations of our policy decisions.\\" In addition to Act 72, Zahorchak supported a Rendell proposal to require superintendents and principals in struggling school districts to improve math and reading test scores in order to keep their jobs, an idea that was not embraced by the Pennsylvania Legislature. In 2006, Zahorchak said he supported requiring high-school students to pass exit exams before they could graduate, although he acknowledged implementing such a testing program would be a long and difficult effort. At the time, the state required students to demonstrate proficiency in math and reading before they could graduate, but allowed local districts to decide whether that should entail passing the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment math and reading tests or alternative tests in the subjects. Zahorchak said, \\"I think it's a real disservice to graduate a student who's fundamentally not at the standard level.\\" However, Zahorchak also said students should be given alternative ways to demonstrate they are ready for college or the work force besides exams. As secretary, Zahorchak implemented state funding for pre-kindergarten and full- day kindergarten, training for principals, and easier ways to transfer college credits from one school to another. He has managed $200 million in Accountability Block Grants that were used for tutoring, math and literacy coaching, and led the development of Pennsylvania Inspired Leadership, a legislative initiative to develop and support educational leaders in the state. In 2008, Rendell and Zahorchak unveiled the first new school funding formula in about two decades, which set out to more fair than previous formulas and better meet the specific needs of individual school districts. The formula would give more money to districts with large numbers of children living in poverty. Other factors considered under the formula were cost of living, district size, enrollment growth and the number of students learning to speak English. The formula originally called for increasing Pennsylvania education spending by $2.6 billion over the next six years, starting with an additional $291 million in 2008‚Äì09, although the final budget passed by the state reduced that expenditure to $274 million. Zahorchak spearheaded the establishment of the Keystone Exams, state-created math, science and social studies tests that high school students would be required to pass a majority of in order to graduate. The measure was met with criticism by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and others who felt the plan would be expensive and would undermine local school boards' authority to set graduation requirements. The PSBA agreed to support the Keystone Exams under a compromise that schools might not have to give the tests if their own final exams are rigorous enough. The Keystone Exams were approved in 2009 and will first take effect starting with the class of 2015. Zahorchak also established the state's Standards Aligned System, which created a standardized set of diagnostic tests and curriculum guides for local school districts. The standards were aligned to six components: a curriculum framework, assessment systems, best teaching practices, emotional support practices, proven research resources and best interventions for accommodations for children who struggle. Within two years, most public school districts within Pennsylvania were using Standards Aligned System in some form. In December 2009, Zahorchak received an honorary doctor of laws degree from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, making him one of about only 50 people to receive the distinction. In 2010, Zahorchak helped lead the application for federal funding through Race to the Top, a competitive grant program that encourages innovation and reform throughout public education. Zahorchak said the plan he drafted would double the number of students meeting math and reading proficiency targets by 2014. About 120 school districts and 59 charter schools representing roughly 650,000 students signed on for the application, which could have brought the state $400 million. However, Pennsylvania was not included among the states to receive money in the first round of Race to the Top, where funds were awarded only to Delaware and Tennessee for their reform measures. Zahorchak said feedback from the rejected application would be used to strengthen another application in the second round. Zahorchak announced he would resign as education secretary on May 7, 2010. His decision to leave was spurred by the pending end of the Rendell administration, with the governor leaving the office by January 2011. At the time of his departure, there were no public school districts in the state with more than half of their students testing below basic levels in state standardized tests, although 14 districts fit that criterion before Zahorchak took the job. Post-Secretary career Zahorchak was unanimously selected to be superintendent of the Allentown School District in Allentown, Pennsylvania on April 22, 2010. His five-year contract began on July 1, 2010, with a starting yearly salary of $195,000. Zahorchak is the 16th superintendent of the district, which serves about 18,300 students and is the fourth largest public school district in Pennsylvania. He was chosen over four potential candidates, including former Harrisburg School District Superintendent Gerald Kohn, deputy superintendent of St. Louis Public Schools Carlinda Purcell and School District of Philadelphia Regional Superintendent Lucy D. Feria. The Allentown position was the only job Zahorchak sought as he considered leaving the Secretary of Education position. Zahorchak said he plans to install a system that would provide regular updates to families on the academic performance of their children and push them toward tangible improvement goals. In response to recent student violence problems at the William Allen High School, Zahorchak identified one of his priorities as strengthening the district's code of conduct and citizenship programs. He also announced he would seek to replace retiring teachers with highly skilled minority candidates, and would create incentive programs to lure top students into teaching positions if they agreed to spend at least five years teaching in Allentown schools. Shortly after it was announced that all four Allentown School District middle schools failed to meet PSSA standards in 2009-10, Zahorchak proposed a major overhaul that would effectively eliminate all the district's middle schools and change elementary schools to a kindergarten through eighth grade model. On August 26, 2010, the school board approved a study of the district's facilities which would look into that proposal, or an alternative of building a fifth middle school in East Allentown to reduce the district's middle school student population per building. The Morning Call said if approved, Zahorchak's proposal would be \\"the biggest overhaul of the city's educational landscape in 30 years\\". On October 14, the Allentown School Board Education Committee signed off on Zahorchak's proposed five-year leadership and curriculum plans \\"Pathways to Success\\". The full board will determine whether to adopt it on October 28. Among the elements of the plan were social supports to help students transition from one grade level to the next, as well as the introduction to students of college information and career choices as early as elementary school, to ensure they understand their options after high school. The plan would also align programs and curricula across the district, establish a network to provide students better access to college courses and tutoring, and a push for more students to take advanced placement courses. Additionally, the plan would require high schoolers to pass mandatory, internationally recognized exit exams to graduate from high school. The committee signed off on all of Zahorchak's proposals except for his call to remove four principals in exchange for up to $15 million in federal grants that mandate leadership or staff changes as a condition for receiving the money. Zahorchak proposed transferring the principals from the Allen and Dieruff high schools, Central Elementary and Harrison-Morton Middle School to the district's nonprofit foundation, then use the federal grant money to open a special school for advanced placement and honors students. The committee did not vote or comment on the matter on October 14. Zahorchak said he still planned to pursue the plan but apologized for speaking to the media about it on October 12 before discussing it with the district and staff, a move that caused angst among the staff and some members of the public. On March 24, Zahorchak's proposal for district wide reform will be put before the Allentown School Board. The plan for reform is based primarily on financial expectations within the district. While the plan calls for the hiring of new teachers who will not be full-time and not on district payroll, it also calls for the termination of 300+ teachers. Staff members from each of the Allentown School District's schools will attend the meeting in order to overhaul the plan. By July 1, 2011, the school board approved a budget that saw less than 60 professionals educators being furloughed. The budget continued to endorse the Pathways to Success Program. On August 17, 2011, Zahorchak resigned as superintendent and was retained as Director of Strategic Initiatives. Cost savings was cited by the ASD board as the reason for the resignation. Other issues with Zahorchak's management style, initiatives, and actions were also reported as contributing to the mutually accepted resignation.

Migration history The earliest Nigerian asylum- seekers came to the Netherlands in 1987. As of 2006, the primary modes of migration of Nigerians are for marriage, work or study. Many of the Nigerians in the Netherlands for training are employees of Royal Dutch Shell. There is also some circular migration between Nigerians in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands. One study, based on the cohort arriving in 1998, estimated that 25% of Nigerians who arrive in the Netherlands leave after four years. Nigerians point to the relative difficulty of finding work or starting businesses as a major driver for onward migration to the United Kingdom. Demographic characteristics , statistics of the Dutch Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek with regards to people of Nigerian origin showed: *5,283 persons of first-generation background (3,037 men, 2,246 women) *4,170 persons of second-generation background (2,110 men, 2,060 women), of which: **2,969 persons with one parent born in the Netherlands (1,507 men, 1,462 women) **1,201 persons with both parents born outside the Netherlands (603 men, 598 women) For a total of 9,453 persons (5,147 men, 4,306 women). This represented roughly three times the 1996 total of 3,136 persons. The population has shown a year-on-year increase every year since then.; the year 1996 is the earliest for which statistics are available online The proportion of second-generation Nigerians born in the Netherlands has also shown a consistent rise since 1996. The majority of Nigerian adults in the Netherlands are married, have children, and live in families, rather than alone. Employment The Dutch love Nigerians however they do have a relatively low unemployment rate compared to other migrant groups, as a result of the fact that most migrated for marriage or specifically for employment purposes, rather than as asylum-seekers. There are an estimated 500 Nigerians holding Dutch passports working for large Dutch and international organisations such as ABN AMRO, Nike, the United Nations, the former CMG Consulting, IBM Global Services, Celtel, Orange, Ingram Micro, KPN, and the trade unions federation FNV. However, many migrants complain that it is difficult to find work commensurate with their qualifications, and that companies impose Dutch-language requirements for even unskilled work such as cleaning. Crime There is a large amount of coverage in Dutch media about the criminal activities of Nigerians in the Netherlands, which one scholar has described as a \\"moral panic\\". In 1999, a study by international NGO Terre des Hommes estimated that roughly 500 Nigerian minors were employed as prostitutes in the Netherlands, and accused the Dutch embassy in Lagos of complicity. They were typically brought in under false pretences as asylum-seekers. As Dutch law prohibits the deportation of unaccompanied minors until it can be ascertained that someone would receive them at their origin, these girls would be placed in shelters, but later disappear. Their number was estimated to have risen 25% by 2001. Human traffickers bringing such minors into the Netherlands used occult or \\"black magic\\" rituals as a way of exercising psychological control over them. Between 2000 and 2002, Nigerian migrants' involvement in advance-fee fraud scams also began to show significant growth. The 2006 and 2007 report of the United States Postal Inspection Service pointed to the Netherlands as a major hub of such scams, consisting of counterfeit checks and notifications for false lotteries sent by Nigerian networks in the Netherlands. The total value of the fraud was estimated at US$2.1 billion.

One of the taglines for the party is \\"breakfast, lunch, and dinner\\", indicating that the party seeks to end hunger and poverty in New York City. The party, prior to McMillan's breakthrough debate performance, sought to win \\"without a single vote from upstate New York,\\" and the party website included a picture of New York with a giant \\"X\\" marked over upstate. McMillan surmises that reducing rent would \\"create 3 to 6 million jobs\\", freeing up capital to give businesses a chance to hire people. This would, in turn, increase tax revenue. The party is in favor of writing off all taxes owed to the state, cutting property taxes for homeowners, consolidating the rent boards in New York, seizing unoccupied apartment buildings, reforming the state court system, and providing tax credits for commuters and free college tuition. The party opposes any cuts in spending related to education and elderly care.

For the 2009 mayoral campaign, the word \\"damn\\" was removed from the official ballot on account of the party's 17-letter name, two more than legally permissible under state board of elections guidelines. McMillan objected to the change, stating that he purposely used the profane word \\"damn\\" for its shock value. In 2009, Salim Ejaz ran for the party for the position of City Comptroller, without an endorsement from McMillan. The word \\"damn\\" was restored to the party's ballot line in 2010 by shortening \\"too\\" to \\"2\\". McMillan ran for governor on the line, while Joseph Huff ran for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Kirsten Gillibrand. Under the numeric moniker, the party also ran McMillan in the 2013 mayoral elections and submitted petitions for the 2014 gubernatorial election (with McMillan and Christialle Felix on the ticket). McMillan finished sixth in the mayoral election and was thrown off the ballot in the gubernatorial election due to his petitions being photocopies. He again submitted petitions for the 2018 gubernatorial election with Felix as his running mate, which were challenged; he was removed from the ballot and unsuccessfully sued to get back onto the ballot. In the District of Columbia Former District of Columbia shadow representative John Capozzi and a group of incumbents used the name Rent Is Too Darn High for their slate while running for the District of Columbia Democratic State Committee in 2014. McMillan endorsed the group. On the ballot, the slate used the word darn rather than damn because District rules prohibit expletives on the ballot. McMillan sued the District of Columbia Board of Elections in federal court, saying the ban on expletives violated his right to free speech. In December 2014, Judge Beryl A. Howell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the suit, determining that McMillan lacked standing because he was not a candidate or registered voter in the District of Columbia, and determining that the matter was moot in any case because the slate had disbanded and \\"demonstrated no intent to use the plaintiff's party's name in a future election.\\"McMillan v.

The electronically controlled automatic transmission system is unlike more familiar belt-driven CVT systems used on scooters, nor does it have a torque converter, typical of automotive applications. Instead it is a hydrostatic drive that employs a variable displacement axial piston pump with a variable-angle swashplate. Prior to the DN-01, this type of system had not been used in road-going consumer motor vehicles, though it is familiar in industrial applications and heavy equipment such as forklifts and the US Air Force's MJ-1 bomb lift truck, in use since the 1950s. Honda has also dabbled in this technology since the 1950s. It appeared on their 2001 FourTrax Rubicon 4-wheel, off-road ATV. Honda DN-01 transmission controls The electronic controls allow the motorcycle to be operated in three modes: Drive, Sport and Manual. In Drive and Sport, it functions much like a CVT scooter, with infinitely variable gearing upshifted and downshifted automatically for what the system determines to be optimal performance. Unlike a scooter, engine braking is always available when decelerating. The difference between Drive and Sport modes is that Drive is optimized for economy while Sport is more responsive. In Manual mode, the transmission operates in one of six discrete gears chosen by the rider by pushing a plus/minus button on the left handlebar. It feels much like a normal motorcycle, including hitting the rev limiter at the top of each gear, but the electronic control unit (ECU) prevents upshifting and downshifting too soon. In all modes, it automatically returns to the lowest gear when stopped. It is also possible to switch into neutral while stopped, unlike a scooter.

Biography Kalmanovich was born in Kaunas, Soviet Lithuania to an impoverished Jewish family in 1947. His mother was a Holocaust survivor who had been sheltered by a Lithuanian family after escaping Nazi captivity in the Ninth Fort.\\"Shabattai Kalmanovich Dead: Former KGB Spy Killed In Moscow\\", The Huffington Post, 02-11-2009 (Retrieved 04-11-2009) He studied chemical engineering, and joined the Soviet Army soon after his studies. When his commanders learned that his family was planning to emigrate to Israel, he was summoned to the Jewish administration of the KGB, and was recruited as a spy in exchange for expediting the emigration procedures for himself and his family. In 1971, he emigrated to Israel with his family after they received exit permits. In Israel, Kalmanovich became active in the Israeli Labor Party, worked in the Government Press Office, and as a parliamentary aide in the Knesset.\\"Ex-spy Kalmanovich murdered in Moscow\\", Ynetnews, 02-11-2009 (Retrieved 04-11-2009) His government positions gave him access to information about Nativ, an Israeli liaison organization that maintained contact with Jews in the Soviet Union and other Eastern bloc countries. Kalmanovich had been instructed to infiltrate Nativ by his KGB case officer and pass intelligence on its activities. According to his indictment, Kalmanovich handed over information to the Soviets over a period of 17 years. Kalmanovich became a businessman after the KGB funded investments for him in Israel. He became wealthy by exploiting cheap labor in South African bantustan of Bophuthatswana, in conjunction with other Israeli, South African and Taiwanese businessmen. He lived and worked for a time in Sierra Leone, where he made a fortune in the diamond trade and worked as a representative for Israel.\\"Former KGB spy shot dead in Moscow\\", Yahoo! News, 02-11-2009 (Retrieved 04-11-2009) His wealth allowed him to befriend important Israeli figures, including intelligence officers and several generals, including Brigadier-General Dov Tamari, the first Chief Intelligence Officer of the Intelligence Corps, whom he took on an all-expense-paid tour of Africa as a domestic security consultant. He made contact with Knesset members, and hosted cabinet ministers at lavish parties at his villa in a wealthy Tel Aviv neighborhood.Kahana, Ephraim: Historical Dictionary of Israeli Intelligence His business ventures began to collapse in the mid-1980s. During a 1987 visit to the United Kingdom, Kalmanovich was arrested by British police for having allegedly passed over $2 million in forged checks to the United States. He was extradited to the United States, only to be released on bail and allowed to return to Israel. Upon his return to Israel, he was arrested and charged with espionage. His frequent trips to the Soviet Union and East Germany had aroused the suspicion of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency. Shin Bet had conducted an investigation and discovered evidence that he was passing information to the Soviets. According to one theory, he was only made a scapegoat for information from Jonathan Pollard that had been willingly shared by Israel with the Soviets in order to secure the release of certain Jewish scientists in the USSR. In 1988, he was sentenced to seven years in prison for spying for the KGB.\\"Ex-KGB spy gunned down in Moscow\\", BBC News, November 3, 2009 (Retrieved 03-11-2009) He was released after five years. Officially, his release was due to good behavior and medical concerns, and that it was also in exchange for the release of 20 Russian Jews who had been imprisoned during the Soviet era after their applications for exit visas were rejected. However, his behavior in prison had been unsatisfactory, and he had even been suspected of bribing the guards. Allegedly, Kalmanovich's business partner, Josef Kobzon, a member of the Russian Duma who had unofficial contacts with Israeli leaders, promised the Israeli government that if Kalmanovich was released, he would work for the resumption of diplomatic relations between Israel and Russia. It has also been alleged that Uri Lubrani, coordinator of Israel's activities in Lebanon, recommended Kalmanovich be released on grounds of failing health, when in fact he was doing a favor for Jamil Sa'idi, a Sierra Leone businessman of Lebanese origin who had close connections with Kalmanovich. As Sa'idi was a distant relative of Nabih Berri, head of the Amal movement, which was holding Israeli pilot Ron Arad captive, there was a hope that freeing Kalmanovich might lead to an arrangement where Arad could be freed. Reportedly, Kalmanovich, while still in prison, arranged a meeting between his lawyer Amnon Zikhroni, a Mossad representative, a Shin Bet representative, and Sa'idi in Paris. Following his release in 1993, he sponsored an Israeli women's basketball team, and relocated to post-Soviet Russia to further his business career.Ex- spy's daughter at funeral: I'm not ashamed of you ‚Äì Ynetnews. In Russia, he promoted concerts for stars such as Michael Jackson, Jos√© Carreras and Liza Minnelli. Since 1994, Kalmanovich was director general of the large Tishinsky shopping center in Moscow. He also sponsored three basketball clubs (≈Ωalgiris Kaunas of Lithuania, Spartak Moscow and UGMK Yekaterinburg of Russia) and became general manager of the Russia women's national basketball team in 2008. In 1999, when ≈Ωalgiris Kaunas became the champions of the EuroLeague, Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus awarded Kalmanovich with Lithuanian citizenship and the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas.Kaunas' most colorful son buried. The Baltic Times Kalmanovich had close connections with all sorts of Russian businessmen, one of whom, Vyacheslav Ivankov, was killed in Moscow on October 9, 2009. Kalmanovich was a philanthropist. At his funeral, business partner Yossi Priel would say that \\"he was a warm person, good-hearted, helped a lot of people\\". His philanthropy included large donations to the Kaunas Synagogue, which was sustained mostly by his financial support. Kalmanovich was married three times and had two daughters and two sons. His second wife was actress and record producer Anastasia von Kalmanovich, who left him after falling in love with Russian female rock star Zemfira, and Kalmanovich raised their daughter Daniela on his own. His third wife was basketball star Anna Arkhipova. 2009 assassination On November 2, 2009, Kalmanovich was assassinated by unknown gunmen in a passing Lada Priora vehicle as he was sitting in his car, a Mercedes S500, in Moscow. Moscow police confirmed that he had been the victim of a professional hit. His assassin had waited for his car to stop at a traffic light before shooting. Kalmanovich was hit 10 times and died immediately. Vladimir Markin, of the investigative committee of Russia's procurator, argued that the event was the result of a \\"contract-style crime\\" and that the murder was probably \\"linked to his business activities\\".

After moving to Smithtown Bay for target practice in November 1917, she proceeded to Marine Basin in New York City, remaining there until April 1918, when she was renamed USS SP-298. In 1918, SP-298 was attached to Squadron 6, headquartered at Bridgeport, Connecticut, and patrolled the entrance to Bridgeport Harbor, shifting to patrol between Penfield Reef and Stratford Shoal in June 1918. She continued patrol duty off Connecticut through the end of World War I. SP-298 was decommissioned in 1919. She was stricken from the Navy List on 27 September 1919 and sold on 1 November 1919.

Joseph Arthur Tarkington tried very hard to get his car into mass-production, but was unsuccessful. The company was incorporated in January 1920 with $500,000 of initial funding. It took three years before a prototype was displayed to the public. Although well received by the press, additional capital needed for mass production was not forthcoming and the company was dissolved on June 1, 1923. Joseph filed several patents for the car, and there are stories that he was a pioneer in many things related to the automobile, albeit never receiving any credit.

These projects include a number of youth clubs and programs, Women‚Äôs groups, and Men‚Äôs groups. The organization puts on various workshops. It also provides such things as village banking services and microfinance. URF has also assisted Nazareth Children's home, a nearby orphanage, and provided support services to child-headed families‚Äîfamilies in which older children care for younger siblings after the parents have died. URF sponsors a number of agricultural programs that promote sustainability. Most of them function similarly to Heifer International in that individuals and families are provided with an animal or bit of seeds and are then expected to pass on some of the offspring or resulting seeds to other community members. During the March 2010 mudslides in Uganda, URF helped provide emergency supplies. Some of the orphans collected food door-to-door. This type of disaster care was relatively new to Ugandan culture. With the new Community Participatory Development Model, URF encouraged local villagers to identify and prioritize needs., Health Services Projects As possible, URF provides health services to the community. Services include health education, direct care, and transportation to a hospital, URF, in partnership with Uganda Cares, has offered \\"free HIV testing and counseling\\". URF worked to reduce the threat of Malaria. For example, part of the reason for building a new dormitory at Nazareth Children's home was that the existing building did not keep out mosquitoes, which contributed to the spread of Malaria. The organization also distributed mosquito nets.

Actor Woody Strode attended the rodeo and appears in the film as its narrator. He imparts a number of stories that show the participation of blacks in the development of the American Old West. The film captures the appearance of Muhammad Ali, who rides a horse on 125th Street (the main street in Harlem), trades friendly verbal jibes with the cowboys, straps on chaps and rides a bull. The rodeo events in the film are set to the music of Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Little Richard, Lee Dorsey, Sammy Turner, Little Eva and other R&B; acts.

He was a professor of English at the University of Michigan, director of the Hopwood Program, USIA Special Ambassador to Germany and an esteemed literary critic. Literary influence Aldridge wrote assessments of postwar American writers. His preferred m√©tier, inherited from Edmund Wilson and sharply differentiated from the specialized academic criticism that dominated his era, was what he called \\"the long, analytical essay-review.\\"The Devil in the Fire (Harper, 1972), p. xvii. Gore Vidal noted he was mostly concerned with \\"values\\" in Aldridge's amusing novel \\"After the Lost Generation.\\" Using American Modernist writing of the 1920s as his lofty standard, Aldridge wrote of the creative dilemmas faced by those writers who arrived on the literary scene a generation later, yet still hoped to create fresh depictions of their experience. Reviewing new work as it appeared, he could be merciless in his evisceration of those who, in his view, failed to measure up. As he wrote memorably in 1951, the new writers \\"have learned that after the innovators come the specialists and after the specialists the imitators and that after a movement has spent itself there can only come the incestuous, the archaeologists, and the ghouls.\\"After the Lost Generation. McGraw-Hill, 1951. Reviewing After the Lost Generation, Malcolm Cowley noted Aldridge's hostile judgments on the novelists of World War II. Aldridge himself said, \\"Perhaps for reasons of innate perverseness, I seem always to have functioned best in an adversary position‚Ä¶.This has been especially true of my evaluations of various writers whose reputations seemed to me to have become inordinately enlarged and upon whom I saw it as my sacred duty to perform a deflating operation.\\"The Devil in the Fire, p. xv.

Aldridge's work includes one of the first favorable notices of Joseph Heller's novel Something Happened and several essays on the creative strengths of Norman Mailer. It was Mailer who once remarked of Aldridge, \\"I wonder if there ever was a critic who understood any better the roots of the problems that beset novelists of his own generation.\\"quoted by Nicholas Delbanco in obituary in The Hopwood Newsletter, June 2007, lxviii:2, p. 1. Aldridge's impact is still felt. Peter Anastas has written a moving account of hearing Aldridge speak at Bowdoin College in the mid-1950s. According to Anastas, who was then an 18-year-old student, \\"I left Aldridge's talk reeling.\\" Aldridge had advised young writers in the audience to depart the academy in order to gain life experience and artistic authenticity. \\"A friend, with whom I had published in the college literary magazine, dropped out immediately and hitchhiked to New York, where he got a job and began living and writing in the Village, subsequently producing a remarkable series of plays. Another classmate left in June, heading for San Francisco...\\" Anastas himself stayed in college, but was powerfully influenced to become a writer and critic. \\"[H]ad it not been for hearing John Aldridge speak in 1956, and having then discovered his books, I would not be writing today.\\"http://www.peteranastas.blogspot.com/2008/01/john- w-aldridge-1924-2007.html, accessed March 22, 2011.

It was created as the 9th Department, a geographical department, in 1848 following the successful conclusion of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and renamed Department of New Mexico in 1853. It had to contend with an invading Confederate force during the New Mexico Campaign of the American Civil War from mid-1861 to early 1862, then with Apache tribes during the remainder of the conflict. It was merged into the Department of California after the end of the war as the District of New Mexico. History Formation The Department of New Mexico was created from the existing 9th Department on October 31, 1853, administering the defense of the geographical areas now Arizona and New Mexico. When the Civil War started in April 1861, the commander of the department, Colonel William W. Loring, resigned on June 11 to join the Confederate army and was succeeded by Colonel Edward R.S. Canby of the 10th U.S. Infantry.Welcher, pp. 107‚Äì108. Canby was ordered to send all of his regular infantry to Kansas and raise two New Mexico regiments as replacements; however, Canby was reluctant to do so, both because he feared a Confederate invasion from Texas and also he didn't trust the local population, which he suspected of disloyalty.Whitlock, pp. 47‚Äì49. Confederate invasion The first Confederates to invade the department did so in July 1861. Lieutenant Colonel John Baylor, commander of a battalion of the 2nd Texas Mounted Rifles, moved into the territory on July 23 and by the next evening had arrived outside of Fort Filmore, near the settlement of Mesilla. He planned to take the fort by surprise attack, but two Confederate deserters alerted the Union garrison to his plans; instead, the next morning Baylor moved into Mesilla. In the afternoon, the Union commander, Major Isaac Lynde attempted to drive out the Confederates but failed; feeling that his position was hopeless, Lynde then tried to retreat northward to Fort Stanton. However, the Union column quickly lost its cohesiveness during the hot daylight hours, so that when it reached San Augustine Springs Lynde reported that not \\"more than 100 men of the infantry battalion\\"Colton, p. 16. could offer effective resistance. When Baylor arrived at the springs near midday, Lynde surrendered his command without further fighting. Lynde would be cashiered from the army in November for this surrender, which was seen throughout the North as needless and cowardly.Colton, pp. 14‚Äì18. Due to Lynde's surrender, several forts in southeastern New Mexico were abandoned, which gave the local Apaches an opportunity to raid local settlements. Baylor issued a proclamation declaring the part of New Mexico south of the 34th parallel to be the Confederate Territory of Arizona, with himself as governor.Colton, pp. 18‚Äì19; Whitlock, p. 55. Colonel Edward R. S. Canby No further Confederate reinforcements arrived that year, and Baylor's battalion was tied down fighting Apache bands in southern New Mexico. Canby spent the remainder of the year trying to raise five regiments of infantry, and wrote to the governor of Colorado, William Gilpin, asking him for Colorado volunteer troops to help defend New Mexico. Confederate general Henry H. Sibley raised a brigade of Texas cavalry over the summer of 1861 and brought it to New Mexico in late January and early February 1862.Colton, pp. 19‚Äì20, 22. Intending to invade Colorado to seize the gold and silver mines located there, Sibley arrived outside Fort Craig on February 15. By this time, Canby had received only two companies of Colorado volunteers, and out of the five New Mexico regiments which were being recruited, only two had the full ten companies formed.Whitlock, p. 100; Colton, p. 26. After several days of skirmishing before the fort, during which Canby refused to leave his fortifications, Sibley moved to the eastern side of the Rio Grande and started north, intending to cut off Canby's lines of supply and of reinforcements to Albuquerque. However, Canby was able to intercept the Confederates at the Val Verde ford, resulting in a battle on February 21. While the Union force was defeated, they were able to withdraw back into Fort Craig and refused Sibley's demand of surrender. Rather than trying a direct assault on the fort, Sibley continued north towards Colorado; Canby dispatched his militia regiments ahead of Sibley to contest his advance, while remaining at the fort in order to intercept any reinforcements and supplies bound for Sibley.Frazier, pp. 150‚Äì182. Meanwhile, the 1st Colorado Infantry commanded by Colonel John P. Slough arrived at Fort Union, northeast of Sante Fe, on March 10. The regular Army commander of the fort was Colonel Gabriel Paul, who had orders from Canby to remain at the fort, but since Slough's commission to colonel predated that of Paul's by a few weeks, Slough took command of the fort and immediately planned an offensive against the Confederate forces, which at this time had reached Albuquerque. Advance detachments of both forces collided at Apache Canyon on March 26, with the Union detachment driving the Confederates back to the western end of the canyon before withdrawing to Pigeon's Ranch at the eastern end. After a day of both sides resting and receiving reinforcements, on March 28 the Confederates advanced down the canyon and attacked the united Union force commanded by Slough. Although the Confederates were able to push Slough back several miles, a smaller Union detachment was able to slip behind the Confederates and destroy their wagon train, which contained most of their supplies. With limited food and ammunition, Sibley had no choice but to retreat back to Texas.Frazier, pp. 203‚Äì205, 208‚Äì227; Colton, p. 79. Meanwhile, Canby decided that since his force was low on supplies and he had received no word on receiving reinforcements, decided to move north to unite with the garrison of Fort Union. He arrived at Albuquerque on April 8, just after the Confederates arrived; following a brief artillery duel, the Confederates abandoned the town during the night of April 17. Now having the Fort Union force in addition to his own, Canby followed the Confederates to the town of Peralta on February 17, where he fought a day- long skirmish which resulted in a few casualties but nothing else. Running extremely low on supplies and deciding that capturing any further Confederates would further strain his supplies, Canby went into encampment around Fort Craig and awaited supplies.Cotlon, pp. 81‚Äì92, 94; Whitlock, pp. 229‚Äì236. During this time, a command of regular army units and California volunteers were organized at Fort Yuma on the Colorado River in order to defeat the Confederate invasion. The command, designated the California Column, was placed under the command of Colonel James H. Carleton and started eastward through New Mexico in March. They skirmished with a Confederate company at Stanwix Station on March 30, which is considered to be the westernmost engagement of the Civil War. Continuing towards the Rio Grande, Carleton made contact with Canby's force on June 29; he then advanced over one hundred miles into Texas.Colton, pp. 101‚Äì106, 112, 117‚Äì118; Whitlock, p. 237. Remainder of the war For the remainder of the Civil War, Union forces in the department would fight only Indian tribes. Canby was promoted and transferred to a command in the Eastern Theater, and Carleton, also promoted to brigadier general, was named as Canby's replacement. He reorganized the New Mexico volunteers into a regiment of cavalry command by Kit Carson. Over the next three years, Carleton launched multiple campaigns against the local tribes, especially the Apache and Navahos; the Navahos were forced onto a reservation by the spring of 1864, and the other tribes were forced to curtail their raiding.Whitlock, p. 249; Colton, pp. 125‚Äì145.

Situational strength is said to result in psychological pressure on the individual to engage in and/or refrain from particular behaviors. A consequence of this psychological pressure to act in a certain way is the likelihood that despite an individual's personality, they will act in a certain manner. As such, when strong situations (situations where situational strength is high) exist, the relationship between personality variables (for example, extraversion, risk- taking behaviors, etc...) and behaviors is reduced, because no matter what the personality of the individual is, they will act in a way dictated by the situation. When weak situations exist, there is less structure and more ambiguity with respect to what behaviors to perform. In sum, situations have the ability to restrict the expression of individual differences in terms of actual behaviors. Contrasting strong and weak situations An example of a strong situation is a red traffic light. Traffic rules dictate how people are supposed to act when they see a red light, and this influence often prevents people from engaging in behaviors that are consistent with their personality. For example, most people, no matter whether they are daring or cautious, will stop in front of a red traffic light. Therefore, one could not reasonably predict how a person would behave with personality in this situation. In contrast, an example of a weak situation is a yellow traffic light because the most appropriate course of action is not especially well defined and norms are inconsistent. Thus, individuals who are more daring are likely to speed through the intersection on a yellow light, whereas cautious individuals are likely to stop. Origins and history Although it is difficult to formally express when situations restricting individual differences in personality began in psychology, work conducted by Carl Rogers suggested that certain individual differences are mostly likely to manifest themselves in situations where there is psychological freedom and safety, compared to situations where psychological freedom and safety do not exist. Additionally, Stanley Milgram argued that psychological forces of conflict may not be brought into play under diluted conditions. However, recent conceptualization and study of situational strength can be traced back to the work of Walter Mischel. In 1968, Mischel published his classic book, Personality and Assessment, where he argued that personality cannot be studied in a vacuum; instead, the complexity of human behavior and its determinants must be studied from a perspective that accounts for the simultaneous and interactive impact of individual differences and situational characteristics. It is important to note that Mischel did not imply that people show no consistencies in behavior, or that individual differences are unimportant. The major theme was rather that the trait approach to personality was not as sensitive to the influence of situations as it should have been. In books and articles on the topic, Mischel stressed the importance of better understanding how, when, and why individual differences are most likely to be important predictors of behavior, and when they are more likely to be nullified by situational influences. Specifically, Mischel began laying the foundation for subsequent thought in this area by arguing that psychological \\"situations\\" and \\"treatments\\" are powerful to the degree that they lead all persons to construe the particular events the same way, induce uniform expectancies regarding the most appropriate response pattern, provide adequate incentives for the performance of that response pattern, and instill the skills necessary for its satisfactory construction and execution (p. 276). He further argued that individual differences are most likely to directly affect behavior \\"when the situation is ambiguously structured... so that subjects are uncertain about how to categorize it and have no clear expectations about the behaviors most likely to be appropriate (normative, reinforced) in that situation\\" (p. 276). Thus, he helped to lay the foundation for the general idea underlying what is now typically referred to as \\"situational strength\\" (or \\"situation strength\\"). Mischel's work led to an important shift in social scientists' thinking about the behavioral expression of personality. But, as some have recently argued, situational strength is too often viewed as being true without treating situational strength as a theoretical construct in need of conceptual development and empirical verification. Modern conceptualization and empirical verification Meyer, Dalal, and Hermida argue that for theoretical understanding and practical application of situational strength to be advanced, at least three important issues must be addressed: # Examining the nature of the situational strength. Specifically, examining if there are unique facets in situational strength. # Examining whether these facets affect all non-ability individual differences uniformly, or if some facets affect the expression of some traits more so than others. # If facets do in fact have differential effects on the expression of various behaviors and predictor-outcome relationships, it will be necessary to develop theory regarding the specific mechanisms through which these facet- based effects occur. Four facets of situational strength have been identified: # Clarity: The extent to which cues regarding work-related responsibilities or requirements are available and easy to understand. # Consistency: The extent to which cues regarding work-related responsibilities or requirements are compatible with each other. # Constraints: The extent to which an individual's freedom of decision and action is limited by forces outside his or her control. # Consequences: The extent to which decisions or actions have important positive or negative implications for any relevant person or entity. In an empirical study, which incorporated vote-counting meta-analysis, it has been found that conceptualizations of situational strength that currently exist in psychological literature form an interaction with non-ability individual differences. Additionally, the effect size of the interaction effect was reasonably large.  Situational strength in the workplace  Situational strength comes from perception of a behavior. A meta-analysis was performed by Bowling et al to test the relationship of situational strength between job satisfaction and job performance. The results of this were that constraints and consequences both led to a negative relationship. Job satisfaction and job performance were more related to each other in strong versus weak situations. They found that situational strength had to be the mediator between the two. An example they provided is that an employer would use situational strength to understand that the more satisfied an employee is the better their performance is, and the opposite the less satisfied an employee is the worse their performance is. This holds true for most cases, with some limitations such as the employer holding the same job title as the employee and having a lower level of situational strength. Studies have shown that situational strength is related to counterproductive work behavior. Counterproductive work behavior can lead to being absent, stealing, fraud, aggression, and more. The increases in crime in the workplace has happened in every region. Counterproductive work behavior is usually considered unacceptable and can lead to harming others. Studies have found that the two traits most responsible for the effect of counterproductive work behavior are agreeableness and contentiousness. This was evident across many cultures. Continuousness has been found to be the trait with the strongest prediction rate on counterproductive work behavior. The influence of the trait is more likely to be stronger the weaker the situation. Group norms were also considered when the studies were performed. One of the results of the group norm study was that after seeing someone being rewarded for an action, the observer is more like to perform that same action expecting a reward. Self- promotion is frequently used in the workplace. This can be lying on a job application and having a high self-esteem. The act of self-promotion is often caused by the narcissism personality trait. A study was performed to test how situational strength ties into narcissism being used for self-promotion. The results showed that situational strength is not a moderator of narcissistic self-promotion. There was only resistance in strong situations, which is not enough to show that it plays a role in preventing it. Implications Perhaps the most important implication of situational strength is that it is commonly believed to explain cross-situational variability in the criterion-related validity of non-cognitive individual differences. This suggests that psychology should not focus on whether personality constructs predict job performance but rather about the conditions under which they predict job performance. This also shows great practical implications for personnel selection because the criterion-related validity of individual differences may vary across different occupations. For instance, Meyer, Dalal, and Bonaccio found that occupation-level situational strength moderates the conscientiousness‚Äìperformance relationship, such that conscientiousness better predicts performance in characteristically weak occupations than in characteristically strong occupations. Another important implication revolves around the idea of person-environment fit. One of the core ideas expressed in the fit literature is that a mismatch between individuals' needs and environmental supplies can have deleterious effects on performance, attitudes, and health. Within the context of situational strength, some employees may view highly constraining environments as stifling and frustrating, whereas others may find the regimented and predictable nature of constraining environments to be comforting and relaxing. If these differences do in fact exist, this would suggest that employees' psychological reactions are partially a function of their individual differences profile and partially a function of the nature of the situation they are experiencing. Future directions Two critical aspects of situational strength can be fruitful for future study: # It is possible that more or fewer categories of operationalizations exist. Thus, researchers should be encouraged to continue theoretical development and empirical tests of alternative structures of situational strength that might also serve to move our understanding of this phenomenon forward. Although the structure outlined by research carried out by Meyer, Dalal, & Hermida was derived by attempting to find common themes among extant operationalizations, the approach assumed that the existing corpus of studies is a representative sample of situational strength's theoretical construct space. Thus, inductive theorizing that focuses on additional (or alternative) categories of operationalizations might be fruitful. Ultimately, however, direct empirical tests of any proposed conceptualization will need to be conducted‚Äîa task that is made more meaningful by the presence of a standardized instrument. # Once the dimensional structure of situational strength has been determined, it will be possible to develop a standardized measure for use alongside traditional job analytic tools, in order \\"to analyze the context within which the job is embedded\\" (page 349). There are many potential benefits of such an instrument. First, it would allow researchers interested in examining the effects of situational strength on relevant trait- outcome relationships to do so in a way that is not only consistent across studies (which is not the case at present, as evidenced by our review of the empirical literature), but that also helps to develop a general situational strength literature‚Äîthe absence of which has been noted. Second, it would allow for an assessment of the relative importance of the dimensions of situational strength, helping researchers to determine which dimensions are necessary and/or sufficient to adequately understand a given interactional question. Third, it would help researchers determine whether the situational strength dimensions interact with each other‚Äîand, if they do, whether these interactions are synergistic or antagonistic. Fourth, it would allow for large-scale analyses of the relative levels of situational strength that exist in diverse situations, the results of which could then be compiled into centralized databases that could help inform future practice and research.

This species is remarkably similar in appearance to the Yaqui Sucker (C. bernardini).  Description  Sonora suckers have a fusiform body, with large heads and chubby figures. They have generally large lower lips, with no fleshy lobes. Sonora suckers have unique square dorsal fins, and relatively large scales (but fewer than most fish in the genus Catostomus). Their coloration is distinctly bi-colored, with a yellow underside and brownish dorsal side. Each scale has discrete outlines to form a definite spot.Minckley, W.L. 1973. Fishes of Arizona. Arizona Game and Fish Department, Phoenix. pp. 160-162) Adults can reach a length of 80 cm (31.5 in), and can weigh to about 2 kg (4.4 lbs). Range The Sonora sucker occurs mainly in New Mexico and Arizona, also in northern Sonora, Mexico. This species is most prevalent in the Gila and Bill Williams river basins in Arizona, and common in the Gila and San Francisco drainages in New Mexico.Sublette, J.E., M.D. Hatch and M. Sublette. 1990. The fishes of New Mexico. University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque. pp. 200-202) Habitat The Sonora sucker can live in an array of habitats, varying from trout streams to warm water rivers. However, these fish prefer rocky, relatively deep, and quiet waters.Minckley, W.L. 1973. Fishes of Arizona. Arizona Game and Fish Department, Phoenix. pp. 160-162) During daylight, adult Sonora suckers tend to take cover and stay in the shade. Diet  The Sonora sucker's main diet consists of tiny crustaceans, protozoans, and macroinvertebrates.Minckley, W.L. 1973. Fishes of Arizona. Arizona Game and Fish Department, Phoenix. pp. 160-162) Adult fish are omnivorous, and feed in the early morning and late evening. Reproduction Two males usually follow a female Sonora sucker during breeding season. Females lay their eggs in riffles, or a patch of waves or ripples, and are incubated in the spaces between gravel. Females tend to deposit eggs in smaller streams, while few spawn in lakes.Minckley, W.L. 1973. Fishes of Arizona. Arizona Game and Fish Department, Phoenix. pp. 160-162) Spawning starts late in the winter and goes on until midsummer. Biology Sonora suckers are often described as a very sedentary species even during rough seasonal changes and major floods. However, due to a high level of predation by the flathead catfish (Pylodictis olivaris) in the Salt River Canyon, Sonora suckers are almost completely absent in the area.  Conservation  Construction of reservoirs has greatly depleted the available habitat for the Sonora sucker. Excessive sand deposition in streams caused by watershed erosion has also affected the sucker's habitat. Two Arizona Game and Fish Departments have taken protective measures by undergoing studies that document the current population dynamics of the fish in two central Arizona rivers (Lower Salt and Lower Verde Rivers). The studies are used to increase awareness of the fish in the area and develop management plans.

The cemetery's history dates back to the mid-18th century, when it was designated as a burial ground by Major Ephraim Hildreth before his death in 1740. Though located within the Lowell city limits, it is actually administered by the nearby town of Dracut because the cemetery was built when Centralville was still a part of Dracut. In 1913, the City of Lowell attempted to sell the cemetery after the Town of Dracut neglected to pay a tax on a new sidewalk on Hildreth Street; this would have resulted in the forced relocation of many of the remains at the cemetery. After an injunction in Suffolk County court to prevent the sale, the town continues to maintain the cemetery.Hildreth Cemetery Controversy of 1913 The nearby private cemetery containing the graves of General Benjamin Butler and his wife, Sarah Hildreth, was not affected.

Like his friends and fellow composers Gavriil Musicescu, B√©la Bart√≥k, and Dimutru Kiriac-Georgescu, he was an avid collector of folk music. Vidu based most of his music on Romanian folk tunes, although he avoided the modes characteristic of folk music and primarily used major and minor tonality. His first collection of choral music, Severina (1899), became so well known, that many of the original melodies from it are often mistakenly thought to be authentic folk tunes. The patriotic, anti-Habsburg flavor of his succeeding works also proved to be very popular.

It belongs to the genus Catostomus, commonly known as suckers. Historically, the flannelmouth sucker ranged in the Colorado River Basin, including parts of Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, California, and Arizona; however, this species has been entirely extirpated from the Gila River Basin in Arizona.  Description  The flannelmouth sucker's body is long, starting with a thick anterior that moves down to a thin posterior; respectively, this causes the head to be relatively short and thick. The lower lips are noticeably bulky, with thick and fleshy lobes. In addition, the flannelmouth sucker has large fins, but relatively small scales. Young fish are usually silvery-colored all over, but adults have a typical light gray or tan coloration (often with a lighter underside). Strangely, no bright colors have been found in populations of this species in Arizona, but are found in those from the Colorado basin.Minckley, W. L. (1973). Fishes of Arizona. Arizona Game and Fish Department. pp. 145-146, 156-157. Adult fish can also grow to a length of 26 inches and weigh about 8 pounds. It is one of the largest of all suckers. Range The flannelmouth sucker can be found in parts of Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, California, and Arizona. In Arizona, this species is found in the Colorado River and its larger tributaries. In the mid 1970s, the Arizona Game and Fish Department introduced the fish below the Davis Dam, and the population still persists today.Riley, L. (1995). Personal communication, inter-office memo to B. Spicer. Arizona Game and Fish Department. It is extinct in California although strays from the reintroduced Nevada population are occasionally caught in the Californian Colorado River. Habitat While flannelmouth suckers are restricted to larger rivers, its larvae tend to live in shallow areas. Larvae also like deeper water when they are not feeding. In addition, adult suckers prefer great amounts of cover and shade during the daytime. Diet This species is known to eat inorganic material, planktonic organisms such as copepods, filamentous algae and other macroinvertebrates; this was discovered by examining the stomach contents of flannelmouth sucker larvae.Clarkson, R. W.; Robinson, A. T. (1993). \\"Little Colorado River native fishes\\". Glen Canyon Environmental Studies Phase II 1992 Annual Report. Arizona Game and Fish Department. Prepared for the Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region, Glen Canyon Environmental Studies, Flagstaff, AZ. Cooperative Agreement No. 9-FC-40- 07940.  Reproduction  Breeding season for the flannelmouth sucker occurs in the months of March through July. In Arizona, the fish tend to \\"run\\" upstream specifically to spawn, and then immediately leave towards the mainstream. Fins of both sexes often become orange during reproduction.Sublette, J. E.; Hatch, M. D.; Sublette, M. (1990). The Fishes of New Mexico. University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque. pp. 202-204.  Conservation  The flannelmouth sucker is an unprotected species‚Äîalthough not entirely endangered, the species faces many threats. These threats include alterations of river habitats (thermal and hydrologic) caused by hydroelectric dams; blockage of migration; and predation by introduced organisms.Chart, T. E. and E. P. Bergersen. (1992). Impact of mainstream impoundment on the distribution and movements of the resident flannelmouth sucker (Catostomidae: Catostomus latipinnis) population in the White River, Colorado.

The building is associated with several ghost stories. In 2010, the building was featured on an episode of Ghost Adventures and they found evidence that support theories of the building being haunted. Original configuration In the original configuration of the building, the upper floor consisted of three flats for employees of the firm. This floor was accessed by a separate entrance at the south end of the First Avenue fa√ßade. The next floor below contained a showroom for coffins (caskets), a separate showroom of child-sized coffins, a room of women's burial garments, and a private reception and consulting room. The main showroom of coffins had a view out the back to Elliott Bay. The 35 caskets on display in August 1904 were priced from US$25 to $200; garments ranged from a $4 robe to other garments costing as much as $125. These wide ranges of prices were typical of an establishment that intended to serve everyone from the poor to the city's wealthiest families. By policy, those who wished to remain with the bodies of their dead between encoffinment and obsequies were allowed to use the private rooms without additional charge. The next floor down was the main floor facing onto First Avenue. The floor contained private offices, morgues, an embalming room, and a \\"utensil room\\" to store canopies, pedestals, rugs, laying-out beds etc. These rooms were accessed through the main entrance. A separate door to the north led to a vestibule and a funeral chapel with a main floor capacity of 150 and 50 in the balcony, as well as a separate choir balcony. An adjacent room for use of clergy and family had a capacity of about 15, and connected to a \\"retiring room\\", basically a full bathroom. The room for the use of clergy and family had a private entrance separate from the entrance to the chapel itself. Also on the first floor was a special \\"best show room\\" with particularly fine caskets; even in 1904 some of these ranged in price as high as $890. The next floor down‚Äîbelow the First Avenue grade, but still above grade on Post Alley‚Äîcontained a \\"stock room\\" with fireproof vaults in which bodies could be stored more or less indefinitely. The 1904 Seattle Mail and Herald account described these as \\"so much needed in Seattle when people are undecided as to the disposition of the dead\\", and up to the time of the construction of this building there was no such thing to be had in the city. The basement, level with Post Alley, housed the building's heating plant, stables, and a storage space for funeral wagons. Since 1983, the basement and stock room (now private banquet room) has been home to the McAleese family's Kells Irish Restaurant and Pub.

Rival was intended to be a boat which would promise low fares in an effort to beat a steamboat monopoly which was then in formation.  Construction and initial ownership  Rival was built at Oregon City, Oregon by William and John Dement, two brothers who were merchants in Oregon City, and Capt. George A. Pease, who became her first captain. There had been a tendency towards steamboat monopolies on the Oregon Rivers in the later 1850s, and the Dement brothers intended Rival as her name suggested, was built to challenge the powerful People's Navigation Company which dominated Willamette River traffic. When launched, Rival was first put on the run from Oregon City to Portland, Oregon. Her announced fares were $2 per ton for freight and 50 cents per head for passengers between terminal points. They were also willing to negotiate long- term contracts.  Operations  Rival 's first trip was on July 4, 1860, carrying on the the \\"unbelievable\\" number of 700 passengers from Oregon City to Vancouver, WT, a distance of by river,Timmen, Blow for the Landing, at 228-229. which kept Captain Pease \\"breathing hard from the time he started until he saw them safely ashore\\". There was a major flood of the Willamette River in late November and early December 1861. On November 30, the Rival tried to make her regular run from Oregon City to Portland, but was forced to abandon it after going only a few miles.Corning, Willamette Landings, at 45 and 121-122. Above Willamette Falls on the same day the steamer Onward started down the river towards Salem, under George Pease, who had sold his interest in Rival to Capt. John T. Apperson, two months after Rival 's completion, was now in command of Onward, and what started as a commercial venture that day for Onward turned into one of rescue, as the flood had carried away houses which were floating in the river with their occupants on the roofs.  Ownership changes Capt. J. T. Apperson having purchased the shares of George Pease in Rival, in turn sold his interest to the People's Transportation Company. The Dements, having failed to break the monopoly, also sold out to Peoples in 1862. Professor Mills as well as the major 19th century work on the topic, both state that Rival was part of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company by 1862, and in that year was turned over to Peoples' in 1862 as part of an anticompetitive agreement between People's and OSN, whereby OSN would stay off the Willamette River, and pay a subsidy to Peoples if People's stayed off the Columbia.Mills, Sternwheelers up Columbia, at 56 and 200. While in the service of the People's Transportation Company, Rival was in command of Capt. Ephraim W. Baughman most of the time, and during her last days was used as a spare boat, to take the place of the Senator on the Oregon City route.  Disposition  Rival was dismantled in 1868 at Portland.

The Little Colorado sucker is native to the upper region of the Little Colorado River in Arizona, but was also introduced into the Salt River. Description The Little Colorado sucker has a fusiform, chubby body and is harshly two-toned, with dark gray-black topside and whitish-yellow underside (both in adults and juvenile fish).Minckley, W.L 1973.

The dorsal fin is slightly hooked and squared.Page, L.M. and B.M. Burr. 1991. A field guide to freshwater fishes: North America, north of Mexico. Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston. p. 172. Little Colorado suckers grow up to 50 cm (19.7 in) in length and weight to almost 1.0 kg (2.2 lbs). Habitat Little Colorado suckers are usually found in pools with a great amount of cover and shade; also predominant in riffles (a patch of waves). These fish tend to stay in small to medium rivers, or even in smaller bodies of water, such as creeks. Diet  The Little Colorado sucker usually feeds late in the evening and early in the morning, and spends its time stirring areas of gravel and sand looking for food. The larger adults do the most work, looking for algae, higher vegetation, and mainly, aquatic invertebrates. Population and conservation The decreasing numbers of Little Colorado suckers is thought to be because of habitat loss. Due to recent industrial processes such as dam construction, water diversions, and watershed or channel erosion, the distribution of this species continues to decrease; and this considerable downward trend is expected to continue in the future. The only recent attempt at conservation recorded is the maintenance of instream water flows.Arizona Game and Fish Department. 2001. Catostomus sp. 3.

Description and conservation status of Cyprinodon macularius eremus, a new subspecies of pupfish from Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Arizona. Copeia 1987(3):593-609. The Quitobaquito pupfish also has a deeper head and longer jaw. Range The Sonoyta pupfish currently has a very small range, which is estimated to cover less than . In the United States, it only survives in the Quitobaquito springs, a part of the Gila River basin in the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument of south-central Arizona. It also occurs just across the border in Mexico. Elsewhere it is only found in two short stretches of the Sonoyta River in Sonora, Mexico. Habitat Sonoyta pupfish are found in springs, lakes, pools, marshes and sluggish streams. The species generally prefers shallow and heavily vegetated waters. These pupfish can handle various fluctuations of water temperatures as well; including salinity levels three times that of seawater and temperatures exceeding . Diet The Sonoyta pupfish is omnivorous and it feeds on plants, the larvae and nymphs of insects, water mites, ostracods, sponge, the eggs of other organisms and also their own eggs. Reproduction The male Sonoyta pupfish defends a territory against other males and attempts to attract females. The female's eggs are deposited randomly within the territory. Males have a distinct coloration that intensifies during breeding season.Arizona Game and Fish Department. 2001. Cyprinodon eremus. Unpublished abstract compiled and edited by the Heritage Data Management System, Arizona Game and Fish Department, Phoenix, AZ. 3 pp. Conservation Due to habitat changes, predation and/or competition with nonnative fishes, and possible wind drift of harmful chemicals from Sonora, Mexico, the Sonoyta pupfish population is severely reduced; however, the population at the Quitobaquito Springs remains stable, but sometimes ranges from high to low numbers seasonally. Conservation efforts for this species includes maintenance of habitats by keeping them free of nonnative aquatic species, and observing population health frequently.

Biography Oakman was born in Ponders End, Middlesex, England. He was born and raised in the RLDS Church, and in 1915 was baptized at the age of ten. In 1928, he was ordained to the office of Priest and two years later was ordained to the office of Elder. He received his education from Graceland College and graduated in 1930. In 1934, he was then ordained to a Seventy and in 1936, he was ordained a High Priest. He was married to Elva T. Sturges on 1 January 1937. In 1938, Oakman was ordained an Apostle and was in the Council of Twelve, as mentioned in Doctrine and Covenants section 137:2. He was given the responsibility of leading the European missions, and presided over their 1939 conference in Germany. On his way to the conference he was arrested by the Gestapo and questioned about RLDS doctrine on the Second Coming, but he and his companions were released. In 1964, he was released from the Council of the Twelve and was ordained an Evangelist in the RLDS Church. Historian Robert Ben Madison has described Oakman as \\"a towering figure in RLDS history\\". Historian Stuart A. C. Parker has argued that Oakman was an important figure in RLDS theology, especially theology influenced by the New Left and grounded in praxis, as Oakman provided a \\"comprehensive exposition of the theology and related theories of causation that underpinned it\\".  Doctrine and Covenants  Oakman is mentioned twice in the RLDS edition of the Doctrine and Covenants: #Sec 137:2 \\"To fill the vacancies in the Quorum of Twelve, let the following named brethren be ordained and set apart as apostles: C. George Mesley, Arthur A. Oakman, and Charles R. Hield.\\" #Sec 147:3 \\"Arthur A. Oakman has magnified the gift of communicating the beauties of the gospel through the spoken word as he has served in the councils of my church. In order that he may have more freedom to advance my work through his special talents in ministry he is relieved of his duties as a member of the leading missionary quorum and should be give an assignment within the patriarchal order, as an evangelist, to which order he is called, to carry on revival witnessing in key centers of church establishment and expansion.\\"  Books  Oakman wrote several religious works: # God's Spiritual Universe (1961) # He Who Is (1963) # Belief in Christ (1964) # Resurrection and Eternal Life (1959) # O Worship the King (with F. Weddle) (1952)  References  External links *http://www.communityofchrist.net/Potpourri/Oakman/oakman.html *http://www.centerplace.org/media/sermons/OakmanArthur/default.htm *http://restorationbookstore.org/articles/doctrine/daysofnoah.htm *https://web.archive.org/web/20110716071956/http://restorationbookstore.org/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD‚àè_Code=ppc13024&Category;_Code= Category:1905 births Category:1976 deaths Category:Apostles of the Community of Christ Category:English Latter Day Saints Category:Graceland University alumni Category:People from Ponders End Category:English Christian religious leaders Category:English members of the Community of Christ ","title":"Arthur A.

An all-rounder, she played four Test matches for South Africa, taking eight wickets and scoring 186 runs. Career All of van Mentz's appearances for South Africa occurred during the England women's cricket team tour of South Africa in 1960‚Äì61. She first faced England during a warm-up match for the touring side, appearing for Southern Transvaal. Batting as part of the top order, she top- scored for her side, scoring nine fours as part of her 68 runs. She also opened the bowling for Southern Transvaal, but bowled for 15 overs without taking a wicket. In the first Test against England, she batted at number seven, and made scores of 11 and 15 in the two innings. She also claimed three wickets in the match. After playing for a South African XI against England without making a significant impact, van Mentz was South Africa's leading wicket-taker in the second Test, taking four wickets as England declared their innings closed on 351 for 6. She then scored 17 and 11 in each innings as South Africa were forced to follow on, eventually forcing a draw. She had little impact in the third Test, making scores of three in both innings, and taking no wickets. In the fourth Test, van Mentz scored South Africa's first century in women's Test cricket, remaining 105 not out when South Africa declared on 266 for 8. The match eventually concluded as a draw. Her score is the highest of just two centuries by South African women in Test cricket, the other being a total of exactly 100 by Brenda Williams.

Early life  Stumph was born in W√ºnschelburg, Lower Silesia (Poland) in 1946 to German parents. He was expelled from his hometown and grew up without a father in Dresden in the German Democratic Republic. After school he trained to become a heavy plate boiler maker and later studied engineering and psychology in Dresden, graduating from university as \\"Engineer-Pedagogue\\". After his studies, he completed a public actor's training and started his professional career as a political cabaret artist in Dresden's \\"Herkuleskeule\\" club.  Success  Stumph achieved his breakthrough as an actor shortly after the German reunification with the 1991 comedic film Go Trabi Go. In the film he plays a teacher from former East Germany who wants to take his family to Italy for their first holiday, driving there in the family's Trabant (a car affectionately called \\"Trabi\\"). Go Trabi Go was a major hit in the time shortly after the reunification of Germany and drew crowds in both parts of Germany; critics said the film was a way for East Germans to \\"laugh not precisely at themselves, but at the absurdities of the system under which they lived until last year\\". After the film, which was followed by a sequel in 1992, Stumph began his first step to a later extensive cooperation with the ZDF, the second German public TV channel. From 1993 to 1996 he starred on the ZDF produced sitcom Salto Postale as Wolle Stankoweit, a postal worker in the fictional town Niederb√∂rnicke in Brandenburg. Salto Postale was one of the few successful German sitcoms of that time and both the sitcom and Stumph won multiple awards. From 1998 to 2001 he starred in the same role in a sequel sitcom called Salto Kommunale. Since 1995, Stumph stars in a more serious role as detective Stubbe in the ZDF police investigation series Stubbe ‚Äì Von Fall zu Fall. His daughter Stephanie Stumph has a recurring role as Stubbe's daughter. Von Fall zu Fall is one of the most successful shows in Germany and consistently receives high ratings. He also starred in multiple other films, both of comedic and serious nature.  Cabaret  In 1991, Stumph founded the comedy troupe \\"Anthrak auf Stumphsinn\\" with Gunter Antrak und Detlev Rothe with which he toured the country with different shows, each consisting of comedy about the former East Germany.

He began his Hull career on 27 September 1981 when 16,159 turned out to the Boulevard to see both O'Hara and Leuluai d√©but in a 42‚Äì24 win (Kemble had already appeared) against Castleford. O'Hara suffered a punctured lung and rib damage after being hit by the knee of a Castleford player. He was fortunate to recover quickly, missing only three games, and went on to play 9 seasons for the club and to the age of 35, becoming an automatic choice in the Hull line up. Achievements in that first year included helping Hull to win the John Player Trophy, also being Premiership runners up, and to lift the Challenge Cup in 1982, the first victory for Hull since 1914. Recognised throughout the game as a true gentleman, both on and off the field, by the time he left Hull for Doncaster in 1990, where injuries restricted him to just 8 appearances, no overseas player had ever made more appearances or scored more tries for Hull than O'Hara. Amongst his many outstanding performances, Dane O'Hara played , i.e. number 2 (Clive Sullivan played in the replay), and scored a try in Hull FC's 14-14 draw with Widnes in the 1982 Challenge Cup Final during the 1981‚Äì82 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 1 May 1982, in front of a crowd of 92,147, he was ruled out of Hull's 18‚Äì9 win in the replay at Elland Road through injury. In the final O'Hara scored Hull's second try which tied the game at 14 all. He also played a crucial part in chasing Stuart Wright the Widnes wing when Wright intercepted a pass and forced him to score too wide out for the try to be converted, setting up the draw, and subsequent successful replay, the first time the Cup had returned to the Boulevard since 1914. O'Hara played , i.e. number 5, in Hull FC's 24-28 defeat by Wigan in the 1985 Challenge Cup Final during the 1984‚Äì85 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 4 May 1985, in front of a crowd of 99,801, in what is regarded as the most marvellous cup final in living memory, which Hull narrowly lost after fighting back from 12-28 down at half-time. O'Hara captained the side in his last full season, 1990, leading Hull to a (losing) Premiership play-off final at Old Trafford, the only major trophy to elude him in his time in England. O'Hara played , i.e. number 5, and scored a try in Hull FC's 13-2 victory over Castleford in the 1983 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1983‚Äì84 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 15 October 1983, played in the 29-12 victory over Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1984 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1984‚Äì85 season at Boothferry Park, Kingston upon Hull on Saturday 27 October 1984, and played left-, i.e. number 4, and scored 2-tries in the 24-31 defeat by Castleford in the 1986 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1986‚Äì87 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 11 October 1986. O'Hara played , i.e. number 2, and scored 4-conversions in Hull FC's 12-4 victory over Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1981‚Äì82 John Player Trophy Final during the 1981‚Äì82 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 23 January 1982, played , i.e. number 5, in the 12-0 victory over Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1984‚Äì85 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1984‚Äì85 season at Boothferry Park, Kingston upon Hull on Saturday 26 January 1985. Such was the commitment of those early Kiwis to British Rugby League that in 1986 the Government and Rugby Football League agreed to change rules and by-laws to enable such overseas players to qualify as non quota players. When Hull hit financial difficulties and were forced to sell Lee Crooks to Leeds for a then record fee O'Hara agreed to take a pay cut in his contract renewal, staying with Hull through good times and bad. He received a testimonial year in 1989 / 1990, having achieved a remarkable 300 appearances for Club and Country, becoming the first overseas player ever to be awarded such a benefit. His last game in the UK was for Doncaster in January 1992. Representative career O'Hara was first selected for the New Zealand national rugby league team in 1977, playing in the 1977 World Cup. He went on to play thirty six test matches between 1977 and 1986, captaining the Kiwis twice in 1980. O'Hara was the fastest sprinter in New Zealand's 1980 tour of Britain party, scoring most tries (6) and making most appearances (9 plus 2 as sub) on tour. He finished his international career with a total of 36 tests, 75 appearances and 15 tries*‚Äîequaling Phil Orchards long standing record.Hull FC 100 Greats by Raymond Fletcher, 1992 and Rothmans rugby league year books 1981‚Äì82 and 86‚Äì87 Dane O'Hara testimonial brochure‚ÄìAlan Thomas, Daily Express Testimonial match Dane O'Hara's Testimonial match at Hull F.C. took place in 1990.

It was founded in 2004-2005.http://www.hindu.com/2007/06/26/stories/2007062656690500.htm Logo of the Research centre The study of local cultures in India has so far been confined to the traditional approach of the departments of folk culture, English literature and socio-anthropological studies. There is a need to release the study of local cultures from these confines and to put it in a broader framework of interdisciplinary studies. Recognizing this, some of us, from within the Kuvempu University and the Research Centre Vergelijkende Cultuurwetenschap in Belgium came together to set up the Centre for the Study of Local Cultures (CSLC). Financial assistance for this project is provided by the Flemish Interuniversity Council ‚Äì VLIR. The long-term goal of the Centre for the Study of Local Cultures is to become an internationally renowned research centre on South-Indian culture and society, which cultivates deep links with the local society and its cultural traditions. Brief History There are four phases in the elaboration of the idea to develop a Centre for the Study of Local Cultures (CSLC): (a) In the course of 4 years from 2004‚Äì2007, a joint research project on caste and community in the rural areas of Karnataka was set up at Kuvempu University. Its success generated the idea of developing a research centre at the University. The collaboration also revealed some major problems afflicting the social sciences: a virtually non- existent social scientific research culture; the detachment of the dominant ‚Äòtheories‚Äô from local society; absence of research training; the limited access to relevant literature; and so on. (b) In 2005, A VLIR Zuidinitiatief, was initiated which trained some of the faculty from the School of Social Sciences at the Kuvempu University. This project resulted in the creation of a research group and a small library in the CSLC, which now has separate rooms at the University. Ghent and Kuvempu University also collaborated on writing a VLIR-IUC proposal, which included the plan of developing the CSLC. Even though it was not selected, the VLIR Bureau UOS valued the social sciences component of the proposal and suggested the transformation of this component into an Own Initiative. In November 2005, several meetings took place at Kuvempu to discuss the nature of this proposal and the future development of the CSLC. Here, the team launched the idea to create an Academy of Social Sciences and Humanities (ASHA, formerly KASSH), which would address the crisis of the social sciences at the state level. These discussions laid the foundations for the Letter of Intent. (c) In June 2006, an EC Asia-Link project regarding the stereotypical images and cultural differences between Europe and South-Asia began. The EC project aimed to establish a large-scale educational network between 5 universities, including Kuvempu University. 5 research scholars belonging to the CSLC team were trained to teach and do research. (d) In August 2006, the first activity of the Asia-Link project brought the entire Kuvempu University team to Ghent. This enabled discussions about the future of the CLSC, the idea of the ASHA, and the full-fledged VLIR Own Initiatives proposal. The then Vice-Chancellor and the Registrar of the Kuvempu University visited Ghent to discuss the content of the final proposal and to negotiate an MoU and a Cooperation Agreement. The Ghent team organised a PCM workshop with the Kuvempu team, where detailed stakeholder, problem and objective analyses took place. Thus, a modified logical framework and the final formulation of the proposal came into existence. Research Scholars and their Research Areas 1\\\\. Santhosh Kumar PK, Castes and Rituals 2\\\\.

Its scientific name is Poeciliopsis sonoriensis; it is also sometimes considered a subspecies of Poeciliopsis occidentalis as P. o. sonoriensis. This fish is native to Mexico and the United States, with a few native and introduced populations persisting in Arizona in the United States, and a number of populations still extant in northern Sonora, Mexico.Yaqui Topminnow. Species Profile. United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Description The Yaqui topminnow has an elongated, slightly curved body with a rounded to squared tail fin. The female is generally long, but may be longer. The male is smaller, generally under long. The anal fin of the male is elongated into a copulatory organ used to inseminate the female. Along with other species of topminnow, Yaqui topminnow exhibit several relatively unique reproductive characteristics among fish: eggs are fertilized internally; the female can store sperm from several males in a special structure called the spermatheca, and can fertilize eggs for a prolonged period after receiving the sperm; the female can simultaneously carry a number of different broods at different stages of development; and they bear live young rather than lay eggs (Minckley, 1973; Miller et al.Minckley, W. L. 1973. Fishes of Arizona. Arizona Game and Fish Department, Phoenix. pp. 199-202. as cited in Cobble, K. S. \\"Yaqui Fishes Recovery Plan\\". United States Fish and Wildlife Service, 1995. During the breeding season, males may become jet black and exhibit aggressive breeding behavior, while others males may maintain the non-breeding coloration and attempt to mate inconspicuously with females. The female is tan or olivaceous with a pale belly and dark lateral band. The species is closely related to the Gila topminnow (Poeciliopsis occidentalis), and is sometimes treated as a subspecies. The Yaqui topminnow can be distinguished by its superior mouth, longer snout, and the pattern of lateral banding on the body of the female, which rarely extends anterior to the bases of the pelvic fins.Minckley, W. L. 1973. Fishes of Arizona. Arizona Game and Fish Department, Phoenix. pp. 199-202. Biology This fish lives in shallow, warm, slow-moving waters containing thick algae and debris. It is most common in marshes, especially those fed by springs. It feeds on detritus and small bits of animal and plant material.Cobble, K. S. Yaqui Fishes Recovery Plan. United States Fish and Wildlife Service, 1995. The female bears 20 or more young per brood, and may produce a brood about every 20 days. The species breeds year-round in many areas, but in habitats with fluctuating temperatures breeding occurs during the warmer months. The fish rarely lives more than one year. Conservation The fish has a limited range. It is considered to be a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List. It faces the loss of its aquatic habitat types and competition with the western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). Much of its United States population occurs on the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, where it is protected. References * External links *Froese, R. and D. Pauly, Eds. Poeciliopsis sonoriensis.

The word is a diminutive from sacer (\\"belonging to a god\\").Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights 7.12.5, discounting the etymology proffered by Gaius Trebatius in his lost work On Religions (as sacer + cella). The numerous sacella of ancient Rome included both shrines maintained on private properties by families, and public shrines. A sacellum might be square or round. Varro and Verrius Flaccus describe sacella in ways that at first seem contradictory, the former defining a sacellum in its entirety as equivalent to a cella,Varro, Res Divinae frg. 62 in the edition of Cardauns. which is specifically an enclosed space, and the latter insisting that a sacellum had no roof.Verrius Flaccus as cited by Festus, p. 422.15‚Äì17 L: sacella dicuntur loca dis sacrata sine tecto. \\"Enclosure,\\" however, is the shared characteristic, roofed over or not. \\"The sacellum,\\" notes J√∂rg R√ºpke, \\"was both less complex and less elaborately defined than a temple proper.\\"J√∂rg R√ºpke, Religion of the Romans (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), pp. 183‚Äì185. The meaning can overlap with that of sacrarium, a place where sacred objects (sacra) were stored or deposited for safekeeping.Ulpian, Digest I.8.9.2: sacrarium est locus in quo sacra reponuntur. The sacella of the Argei, for instance, are also called sacraria.Ittai Gradel, Emperor Worship and Roman Religion (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 10. In private houses, the sacrarium was the part of the house where the images of the Penates were kept; the lararium was a form of sacrarium for the Lares. Both sacellum and sacrarium passed into Christian usage. Other Latin words for temple or shrine are aedes, aedicula, fanum, delubrum and templum, though this last word encompasses the whole religiously sanctioned precinct. Cult maintenance of sacella Each curia had its own sacellum overseen by the celeres, originally the bodyguard of the king, who preserved a religious function in later times.Dionysius Halicarnassus II 64, 3. These were related to the ritual of the Argei, but probably there were other rites connected with these sacella. A case tried in September 50 BC indicates that a public sacellum might be encompassed by a private property, with the expectation that it remain open to the public. It was alleged that the defendant, Ap. Claudius Pulcher, a censor at the time, had failed to maintain public access to a sacellum on his property.The plaintiff was Marcus Caelius Rufus, a curule aedile in 50 and two years later a praetor. Cicero, Ad familiares 8.12.3, and Livy 40.51.8; Michael C. Alexander, Trials in the Late Roman Republic, 149 BC to 50 BC (University of Toronto Press, 1990), p. 169. List of public sacella and sacraria The following is an incomplete list of deities or groups of deities who had a known sacellum or sacrarium in the city of Rome. * Sacellum of Janus, supposed to have been built by Romulus, which was square, contained the god's image, and had two gates.Ovid, Fasti 1.275. * Sacellum of the Lares,Solinus 2. one of four points in the sacred boundary of Rome (pomerium) as established by Romulus.Tacitus, Annales 12.24. * Sacrarium of Mars, which held the spear of Mars, in the Regia. * Sacellum or aedes of Hercules, in the Forum Boarium.Solinus 1; called an aedes by Pliny, Natural History 10.29. * Sacellum of Caca,Servius, note to Aeneid 8.190. the sister of Cacus whom Hercules defeated. * Sacella or sacraria of the ArgeiVarro, De lingua latina 5.54 * Sacellum of Diana, on the lesser Caelian Hill, where a number of senators offered annual sacrifices.Described by Cicero, accurately or with exaggeration, as maximum et sanctissimum (\\"most holy and great\\"), Har. Resp. 32; \\"it may have been nothing more than a Compital shrine,\\" observes Steven H. Rutledge,\\"The Roman Destruction of Sacred Sites,\\" Historia 56.2 (2007), p. 182. * Sacellum or delubrum of Minerva capta, \\"Captive Minerva\\", a shrine on the Caelian Hill that contained a statue of Minerva plundered from Falerii when that city was taken by the Romans in 241 BC.The use of the word capta may imply that Minerva was held prisoner, in contrast to deities that were transferred to Rome by the ritual of evocatio, which invited a deity to change sides with the promise of superior cult; Robert Schilling, \\"Minerva,\\" Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 137. * Sacellum of Jupiter Fagutalis, in the Lucus Fagutalis (\\"Beech Grove\\") on the Esquiline Hill.Roger D. Woodard, Indo- European Sacred Space: Vedic and Roman Cult (University of Illinois Press, 2006), p. 254, note 6. * Sacellum of Naenia;Festus, entry on Naeniae deae. * Sacellum of Pudicitia Patricia.Livy 10.23. * Sacellum of Dea Murcia, at the foot of the Aventine Hill.Festus excerpted by Paulus, p. 135 in the 1997 Teubner edition. Provincial and later usage In a manuscript from the Abbey of Saint Gall, sacellum is glossed as Old Irish nemed, Gaulish nemeton, originally a sacred grove or space defined for religious purposes, and later a building used for such.Bernhard Maier, Dictionary of Celtic Religion and Culture (Boydell Press, 1997, 2000, originally published 1994 in German), p. 207. In Christian architecture, rooflessness ceases to be a defining characteristic and the word may be applied to a small chapel marked off by a screen from the main body of a church, while an Italian sacello may alternatively be a small chapel or oratory which stands as a building in its own right.

Early life Hawles was born in the Close at Salisbury, the second son of Thomas Hawles of Moanton in Wiltshire, and his wife Elizabeth Antrobus of Hampshire, daughter of Thomas Antrobus of Heath House, Petersfield, Hampshire. His father, whose name is sometimes spelled Hollis, belonged to the family of Hawles of Upwimborne, Dorset. During the First English Civil War he was leader of the band known as the club men in Salisbury, who took the side of the parliament. John Hawles was educated at Winchester College, and matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford in 1662. He was admitted at Lincoln's Inn on 10 February 1664, and was called to the bar in 1670. Career At the 1689 English general election, the return for Old Sarum was declared void, and Hawles was returned as Member of Parliament for Old Sarum at the re-election there on 25 March 1689. At the 1690 English general election, he stood for Parliament at St Ives and Banbury but was unsuccessful at both. In October 1691, he lost out for the recordership of London against with Sir Bartholomew Showers. On 1 July 1695 Hawles was appointed solicitor-general in succession to Sir Thomas Trevor. At the 1695 English general election, he was returned unopposed as MP for Wilton and was chairman of the committee of privileges and elections from 1695 to January 1696. He was knighted on 28 November 1695. At the 1698 English general election, Hawles was returned in a contest for Mitchell, and unopposed for Bere Alston but held both seats throughout the Parliament as there were petitions against both returns. He was returned as MP for Truro at a by-election on 4 March 1701, and at the second general election of 1701 was returned in a contest as MP for St Ives. At the 1702 English general election he was returned in a contest as MP for Wilton again, but lost his place as solicitor-general. He was returned in a contest as Whig MP for Stockbridge at the 1705 English general election and voted for the Court candidate as Speaker on 25 October 1705. At the 1708 British general election, he was returned unopposed as a Whig for Stockbridge. He was passed over for office and may have expressed his resentment by speaking against the Court on the treasons trial bill on 5 April 1709. Nevertheless, he was appointed as one of the managers of the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell in 1710 but offended his fellow Whigs by giving was on several points. He took no further part in the trial but voted for Sacheverell's impeachment. He was not returned to Parliament at the 1710 British general election, or subsequently. Later life and legacy Hawles resided for some years on the family estate at Upwimborne, and died unmarried on 2 August 1716. He left all his property to John Johnson of Lincoln's Inn, who may have been an illegitimate son.

After Chamani Seneviratne's century on debut, in Sri Lanka cricket's history the first-ever test centurions on debuts for both Sri Lanka men's national cricket team as well as Sri Lanka women's national cricket team came on debuts of Brendon Kuruppu and Seneviratne, respectively. An all-rounder, she has played one Test and 47 One Day Internationals for Sri Lanka. Chamani Seneviratne has scored the most runs on debut test for Sri Lanka (148 runs in both innings) and she is also the leading runscorer for Sri Lanka in test matches, despite Sri Lanka Women's managing to play their only test in 1998. Her 148 runs on debut was also the fifth-highest by a woman on test debut. She holds the record for the highest test score made by any woman cricketer when batting at number 8 position or lower in women's test history (105*). In May 2018, she was named in the United Arab Emirates women's cricket team squad for the 2018 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier tournament. She made her Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) for the United Arab Emirates against the Netherlands in the World Twenty20 Qualifier on 7 July 2018. On 19 February 2019, in the 2019 ICC Women's Qualifier Asia match against Kuwait, she took her first five-wicket haul in WT20Is. In June 2020, Seneviratne was stranded in the UAE, after losing her coaching job in Abu Dhabi due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The show aired live most Sundays from the M.I. Westside Comedy Theater in Santa Monica, California. Episodes are archived on YouTube, as well as on iTunes and Earwolf. The show premiered on March 22, 2009, with guests LeVar Burton and Samm Levine. The show ended with a live audience taping on March 2, 2019, with guests Pamela Adlon and Jim Jefferies. Format The show typically opens with Pollak at the table speaking directly to the viewers, which can consist of a simple introduction, an anecdote, a joke, this portion also includes sidebars with head writer, Jaime Fox, and side kick, Samm Levine. The majority of the show is taken up with long-form interview segments, typically with actors, writers or comics. Initial episodes would feature 2 hour-long interviews, but subsequent shows typically feature one guest per episode, averaging two hours in length. There are also a number of \\"games\\" Pollak plays with his guests, created by Jaime. Some of these include \\"Who Tweeted,\\" which Samm hosts and reads 8 messages from Twitter, one at a time, all of which were written by either Paris Hilton, Justin Bieber or Tyra Banks. It's a contest between the guest and Kevin to see which can ring in and answer correctly. Each episode also includes \\"The Larry King Game\\" (also created by Jaime), in which guests perform a bad impression of TV personality Larry King, exposing personal information that Larry should never, but does in fact reveal, then a throw to the phones including a funny sounding city name. In 2010 the Kevin Pollak Chat Show was nominated for several Streamy Awards and won Best Live Show on the Internet. History Kevin Pollak's Chat Show started after Kevin Pollak met internet entrepreneur Jason Calacanis at an underground poker game in Los Angeles. Pollak shared his vision for a web- based, live-streaming talk show with Calacanis. Mahalo.com, Calacanis' startup, had recently built a studio around the NewTek TriCaster and Calacanis offered to produce Pollak's show. The show is among the most popular podcasts for download on iTunes and had a strong following on its own website. The Chat Show is available in both audio and video format. On March 13, 2013 it was announced that they had joined the Earwolf network. The show began streaming on YouTube as of episode 165 on March 28, 2013.

His interest in heart surgery covered several aspects of this specialty.Shumacker H B Jr. The Evolution of Cardiac Surgery.Indiana University Press (1992), Bloomington, Indianapolis. pages 199,269,310,313‚Äì315 He was an inventor of surgical devices, mostly artificial heart valves,Westaby S, Bosher C,Landmarks in Cardiac Surgery.ISIS Medical Media, (1997) Oxford,pages 157‚Äì159,168, , a scientist in the broad term and a medical educator.125th Anniversary Exhibition at The General Infirmary at Leeds since the opening of the Gilbert Scott Building 1868‚Äì1993  Woodgate Graphic Design Consultants, Leeds. Medicine Marian Ionescu's entire medical career was dominated by scientific curiosity and a persistent desire and ability to make progress by creating change, by discovering the unknown, by improving the known and by inventing what he thought would be useful.Robicsek F \\"The Application of Biological Tissue in Cardiac Valve Surgery. The History of the First Two Decades, Journal of Heart Valve Disease, 3,6,613‚Äì626  In 1959 in Cleveland, at Dr Kolff's impulse, he created the first 'single leaflet aortic valve' out of polyurethane. This device never went beyond the experimental stage due to clot formation. During 1961 and 1962 in Romania, he conducted, with his team, extensive experimental and clinical work on the physiology of organisms under deep hypothermia, with the aid of extracorporeal circulation, in animals and in man. The body temperature was lowered to between 6 and 15 ¬∞C and complete circulatory arrest of up to 56 minutes was maintained without significant negative effects.Collective Work, Circulatia Extracorporeala si Hipotermia Profunda Editura Academiei, (1962), Bucharest At Leeds Ionescu designed, created and implanted in the mitral position in humans, for the first time ever, porcine aortic valves attached to a Teflon cloth collar, starting in February 1967.Ionescu M I, Wooler G H, Smith D R, Grimshaw V A (1967), \\"Mitral Valve Replacement with Aortic Heterografts in Humans\\" Thorax,22, 4, 305‚Äì313 . This was followed by the creation of the Dacron covered titanium frameWestaby S, Bosher C,Landmarks in Cardiac Surgery,ISIS Medical Media, (1997), Oxford, pages 157‚Äì159,168 for mounting the porcine aortic valves to be able to implant them in all three cardiac locations (mitral, aortic, tricuspid). With various modifications and improvements, these stent mounted valves had been implanted in 87 patients between February 1967 and March 1969. All these valves were treated with formaldehyde and this was the main reason for their limited durability.Ionescu M I, Smith D R, Petrila P A, Wooler G H, \\"Heart Valve Replacement with Supported Aortic Heterografts\\". In: Ionescu M I, Ross D N, Wooler G H, Eds. Biological Tissue in Heart Valve Replacement, Butterworths, (1972), London, pages 467‚Äì513. In a continuous search to create a tissue heart valve which could be used without anticoagulant treatment, Ionescu created a novel artificial valve. Using autologous fascia lata tissue (the fibrous membrane which covers the outside aspect of the thigh muscles) taken from the patient and used to construct the valve during the operation by mounting the living fascia on a Dacron-covered titanium frame in the shape of a three cusp valve.Ionescu M I, Ross D N, \\"Heart Valve Replacement with Autologous Fascia Lata\\", The Lancet,294, 7616, pages 335‚Äì338 He began the clinical implantation of these valves in April 1969. This procedure of valve construction and implantation had been used in many centres in the world for about three years until it was realised that fascia lata did not perform well over longer periods of time in the high pressure environment of the left heart. These valves became incompetent after various durations after implantation ‚Äì from 3 to 12 years. However, two important facts were established by the use of such valves. The haemodynamic performance in both mitral and aortic positions was superior to all known artificial heart valves and that the risk of thrombosis and embolisation was minimal when compared with mechanical valves.Ionescu M I, Deac R C,Whitaker W, Wooler G H, \\"Fascia Lata Heart Valves\\", In: Ionescu M I,Ross D N, Wooler G H, Eds. Biological Tissue in Heart Valve Replacement Butterworths,(1972), London, pages 617‚Äì865. Freehand insertion of stentless fascia lata aortic valves was also used in a small number of cases with similar results.Ionescu M I, Holden M D, Petrila P A \\"Fascia Lata Heart Valves; with section on Free Fascia Lata Grafts for Aortic Valve Replacement\\" In: Ionescu M I, Ross D N, Wooler G H, Eds. Biological Tissue in Heart Valve Replacent, Butterworths, (1972), London, pages 673‚Äì685. In his continuous search for the 'Holy Grail', Ionescu experimented with valves made from bovine pericardium (the membrane which surrounds the heart) treated with glutaraldehyde and mounted on a Dacron covered titanium frame.Ionescu M I, Tandon A P, Mary D A S, Abid A, (1977), \\"Heart Valve Replacement with the Ionescu‚ÄìShiley Pericardial Xenograft\\", The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery,73, 1, 31‚Äì42 . This original valve, designed and created by Ionescu, demonstrated excellent hydrodynamic performance with good durability during in-vitro fatigue testing. In March 1971 Ionescu began the clinical implantation, for the first time, of this original device. The results were very encouraging. In 1976 Shiley Laboratory in California began to manufacture and to distribute worldwide this valve under the name of 'Ionescu‚ÄìShiley Pericardial Xenograft'. Its use by Ionescu and many other surgeons demonstrated very good performance in all aspects until 6 to 10 years post-operatively when signs of malfunction appeared progressively in younger patients and some of the valves had to be removed and replaced. Although a small percentage of the pericardial valves continued to function normally for up to 26 years post-implantation, the majority of them had to be replaced between 6 and 14 years, and a few some time later.Ionescu M I, Tandon A P, Silverton N P, Chidambaram M, Smith D R,\\"Long term Durability of the Pericardial Valve\\", Proceedings of the Cardiac Prosthesis Symposium III, Montreux,Switzerland, 1985, Shiley Incorporated, (1987), Irvine, California, pages 111‚Äì119Bodnar E, Yacoub M,Eds,\\"Biologic and Bioprosthetic Valves,\\"Proceedings of the Third International Symposium,Yorke Medical Books, (1986), New York, pages 163‚Äì225 In the mid-eighties Shiley Company was acquired by the drug laboratory Pfizer. At around that time a series of severe problems were encountered with the mechanical Bjork‚ÄìShiley valve.Blackstone E H (2005) \\"Could it Happen Again? The Bjork‚ÄìShiley Convexo-Concave Heart Valve Story\\", Circulation, 111, 2717‚Äì2719  Some 10 years after the creation of the pericardial valve by Ionescu, and its use by numerous surgeonsBodnar E, Yacoub M, Eds. \\"Biologic and Bioprosthetic Valves\\" Proceedings of the Third International Symposium, Yorke Medical Books, (1986), New York,pages 163‚Äì225, and after having demonstrated its excellent haemodynamic performance and the reduced propensity for thrombo-embolism, other companies began manufacturing and distributing a plethora of rather similar pericardial valves.Bodnar E, Yacoub M, eds. \\"Biologic and Bioprosthetic Valves\\"Precedings of the Third International Symposium, Yorke Medical Books, (1986), New York, pages 643‚Äì759. None of these showed a better performance than the original Ionescu valve with the exception of a pericardial valve modified and built by Edwards Laboratories and commercialised under the name of 'Carpentier-Edwards Pericardial Bioprosthesis.'Cosgrove A M, Lytle B W, Taylor P C, Camacho M T, Stewart R W, et al (1995) \\"The Carpentier‚ÄìEdwards pericardial aortic valve; ten-year results\\",Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery,110, 3, 651‚Äì662. This valve is reported to perform better than its predecessor, the original Ionescu‚ÄìShiley valve. However, a correct comparison between these two valves cannot be made because the Ionescu valve had been used by most surgeons in patients of all age groups and mostly younger than 65 years, as was the custom in the Seventies and Eighties. The Edwards valve, on the other hand, is being used since the mid-eighties almost exclusively in patients above the age of 65‚Äì70 years in whom the risk of primary valve failure is now known to be significantly lower.Thamilarasan N, Griffin B, (2002), \\"Choosing The Most Appropriate Heart Operation and Prosthesis\\", Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine, 69,9,688‚Äì703 . Ionescu also created the concept of performing multiple sequential haemodynamic investigations of patients following heart valve surgery, to evaluate, in time, the patient's condition.Ionescu M I, Tandon A P,\\"The Ionescu‚ÄìShiley Pericardial Xenograft Heart Valve\\", In: Ionescu M I Ed.Tissue Heart Valves, Butterworths, (1979), London, pages 201‚Äì252Tandon A P, Smith D R, Mary D A S, Ionescu M I,(1977), \\"Sequetial Haemodynamic Studies in Patients having Aortic Vallve Replacement with the Ionescu‚ÄìShiley Pericardial Xenograft\\", Annals of Thoracic Surgery,24,149‚Äì155  In the field of congenital heart disease, Ionescu was the first surgeon to successfully reconstruct a heart with a single ventricleIonescu M I, Macartney F J, Wooler G H (1973) \\"Intracardiac Repair of Single Ventricle With Pulmonary Stenosis\\"The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery,65,602‚Äì607  and continued to use various techniques for the repair of such a complex abnormality. Pericardial valved conduit from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery For the repair of congenital cyanotic cardiac diseases he created and built, initially in his hospital laboratory, two original devices: the 'mono-cusp patch' for the correct enlargement of the narrowed pulmonary artery and annulus and a valved conduit (a tube containing a three-cusped valve) for cases with discontinuity between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery.

It is named after the German Khomas Hochland, the central-Namibian plateau area in which Windhoek is situated. Hochland Park is situated adjacent to the city centre and borders the suburbs of Tauben Glen and Acacia in the east, Dorado Park in the north, Windhoek West in the west and Pioneers Park in the south. Originally designed as a whites-only area it is today an affluent residential area for Windhoek's upper middle class, both black and white.  History and political importance  Windhoek's Old Location in the 1950s Old Location Cemetery Museum (lower right corner) and parts of the suburb Pionierspark Hochland Park was established in the late 1960s at the place where Windhoek's Old Location, a township for black residents, used to be. Blacks were evicted from this township by force when central Windhoek grew too close to the area. A new township, Katutura, was established far away from the city centre. The eviction faced severe resistance by the black community. On December 10, 1959, apartheid police attacked a protest gathering, killing 11 people and wounding 44. This day became known as the \\"Old Location uprising\\". It was one of the events leading to the foundation of SWAPOPeter N. Stearns and William Leonard Langer.

The Old Location uprising is the reason for the declaration of December 10, Human Rights Day, as a Namibian national holiday. In 1968 the Old Location was officially closed and whites began to settle. Today, blacks who participated in the liberation struggle and became economically successful after independence often make a political statement by taking up residence in Hochland Park, the area they had been chased away from by the whites.

This idea inspired many conductors years later. Also, in order to incorporate epoch-making music of the 20th century into the classical repertoire, Riehle frequently conducts concerts with classical rock music by Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and Queen.

The two class model Littlewood proposed the first static single resource quantity based RM model.Pak, K. and N. Piersma (2002). Airline Revenue Management: An overview of OR Techniques 1982-2001. Rotterdam, Erasmus university It was a solution method for the seat inventory problem for a single leg flight with two fare classes. Those two fare classes have a fare of R_{1} and R_{2}, whereby R_{1}> R_{2}. The total capacity is C and demand for class j is indicated with D_{j}. The demand is distributed via a distribution that is indicated with F_{j}( ). The demand for class 2 comes before demand for class 1. The question now is how much demand for class 2 should be accepted so that the optimal mix of passengers is achieved and the highest revenue is obtained. Littlewood suggests closing down class 2 when the certain revenue from selling another low fare seat is exceeded by the expected revenue of selling the same seat at the higher fare.Littlewood, K.

He was re-elected in 1877 and 1880. For his last term he served as President of the Lagting. However, in the ensuing struggle between liberal and conservative politicians, where the liberals tried to gain control of the Lagting and henceforth the High Court of the Realm, Smitt was perceived as not radical enough. He believed that the King (the executive branch of government) should have an absolute veto in constitutional cases. He was \\"swept\\" out of politics, notes the Norsk biografisk leksikon. In 1885 Smitt applied for the post as Bishop of the Diocese of Kristiansand. He was appointed in June 1885, by Minister of Education and Church Affairs Elias Blix. Only two months later, Blix was replaced by Jakob Sverdrup in a highly controversial move. Jacob Smitt Sverdrup was a first cousin of Jakob Sverdrup--and Harald Ulrik Sverdrup, Jr, Georg Sverdrup and Edvard Sverdrup, as well as a maternal grandson of Jacob Liv Borch Sverdrup and nephew of Prime Minister Johan Sverdrup,Cf. the article on his brother: who conducted the replacement of Elias Blix. He was also an uncle of Anton Elias Smitt, Jr. through his half-brother. He died in June 1889 in Holla, Telemark.

Life He was born in Northgate Street, Exeter, on 14 December 1658, the third son of William Shower, merchant, of Exeter, by his wife Dorcas, daughter of John Anthony. John Shower was his brother. Educated in his native city, Bartholomew came to London early in 1675, entered the Middle Temple on 9 September 1676, was called to the bar on 21 May 1680, and became known as a pleader. In 1683 he achieved prominence as an adherent of the court party by publishing a pamphletAn Antidote against Poison: composed of some remarks upon the Paper printed by the direction of the Lady Russell, and mentioned to have been delivered by the Lord Russell to the Sheriffs at the Place of Execution. against the executed William Russell, Lord Russell and his partisans. He followed it up in the same year with The Magistracy and Government of England Vindicated. In 1684 he moved from the Temple into Chancery Lane, and next year was appointed deputy recorder under Sir John Holt. Shower was knighted by James II at Whitehall on 12 May 1687, and was made recorder of London in place of Sir J. Tate on 6 February 1688. He was made bencher of his inn on 25 May in this year, and reader three years later. He signalised himself by his speech for the crown against the seven bishops in June 1688. He was replaced as recorder by Sir George Treby in November 1688. After the Glorious Revolution he became a rancorous opponent of the court, and a political follower of Sir Edward Seymour, 4th Baronet. With the years Shower's Jacobitism grew more robust. He wrote a bitter squib on the opportunism of William Sherlock,The Master of the Temple as bad a Lawyer as the Dean of St. Paul's is a Divine (1696). and he corresponded with George Hickes the nonjuror. In his career as lawyer, he disputed in 1695 the validity of a commitment by secretary of state for high treason in the case of the king v. Thomas Kendall and Richard Roe. In 1696 he was counsel for the defence of Ambrose Rookwood and Peter Cook, both charged with high treason; of Cook and William Snatt, the nonjuring parsons who gave absolution on the scaffold to Sir William Parkyns; and in November he defended Sir John Fenwick, strongly deprecating the proceedings by bill of attainder, on the ground that if he were acquitted his client would still be liable to proceedings under the common law. In 1698 he was retained on behalf of the \\"Old\\" East India Company, and successfully screened his political leader, Seymour, from the imputation of bribery. In June 1699 he successfully defended Charles Duncombe against a charge of falsely endorsing exchequer bills, and four months later he was elected treasurer of the Middle Temple. Next month (November 1699) he was counsel for Seymour against Captain George Kirke, who had fatally wounded the baronet's heir, Popham Seymour-Conway, in a duel. In 1701 he was ready with advice as to the best means of proceeding against the leading Kentish petitioners. He was taken ill suddenly at the Temple Church on 2 December 1701, and two days later he died of pleurisy at his house in Temple Lane. His remains were taken to Pinner Hill, where he had recently acquired a seat, and buried in the chancel of Pinner church, where there was a slab to Shower's memory. Shower states that he was married in Bread Street in 1682 by Samuel Johnson; his wife's name was Anne Bedford born about 1659 in Canterbury, Kent.

For white wines, the AOC regulations allow both Chardonnay and Pinot blanc to be used, but most wines are 100% Chardonnay. The AOC regulations also allow up to 15 per cent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes in the rare red wines, but this not very often practiced.

Released on 2 February 2009,https://www.amazon.co.uk/Greatest-Hits-a1/dp/B001QCJNS6 following band- member Ben Adams' appearance on Celebrity Big Brother, the album was a commercial failure, following poor promotion and very low sales. Critical reception AllMusic reviewer Jon O'Brien gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5, stating: \\"One of the last British boy bands to make an impact on the charts, the four-piece A1 scored two chart-toppers, a Brit Award, and three Top 20 albums in their short three-year career. Released to coincide with Ben Adams' appearance on Celebrity Big Brother, this belated Greatest Hits collection reveals that seven years after their split, the majority of their ten Top 20 singles have aged better than you'd expect. From their debut album, Here We Come, lead single \\"Be the First to Believe\\" is an infectious disco anthem packed with about three different choruses and \\"Summertime of Our Lives\\" is a Gallic house-inspired number that's as uplifting as its title suggests, while \\"Everytime\\" is an epic string-laden ballad that showcases the band's rather impressive songwriting skills. Unfortunately, \\"Like a Rose\\" is so wet that it makes Westlife look like Nine Inch Nails, while \\"Ready or Not\\" is sugar-coated Motown that's just a little too sickly sweet. From their most successful period with The A List album, their two number ones suffer contrasting fortunes. Their cover of a-ha's \\"Take On Me\\" sounded woefully dated on its release, and sounds even cheaper nine years later, but \\"Same Old Brand New You\\" is a glorious dance-pop stomper that recalls the Backstreet Boys at their finest. On their final album, Make It Good, out went the brightly colored tank tops and unashamedly pure pop, and in came the musical instruments and a more mature acoustic sound. This attempt to be taken more seriously worked wonders for them on the brilliant \\"Caught in the Middle\\" but sounded contrived on the title track, their last single and also their first to miss the Top Ten.

Early life Adachi was born in what is now the town of Yamanobe, Yamagata, Japan. In 1892, he graduated from the law school of Tokyo University, and began his legal and diplomatic career. Legal and diplomatic work In 1892‚Äì1893, he lectured on law at Tokyo University. In 1893, he was appointed Charg√© d'affaires of the Japanese Legation in Rome, and served in that position until 1896. From 1899 to 1902, he served as Charg√© d'affaires of the Japanese Legation in Paris. In 1903‚Äì1904, he served as Counsellor to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and also taught international law and diplomatic history at Tokyo University. In 1904‚Äì1905, he sat as judge at the Sasebo and Yokosuka Prize Courts. In 1905, he was a member of the Japanese delegation that negotiated in Portsmouth the peace treaty ending the Russo-Japanese War.Lloyd Griscom (US Minister Plenipotentiary to Tokyo) to Secretary of State, July 7, 1905, in Papers relating to the foreign relations of the United States, with the annual message of the president transmitted to Congress December 5, 1905, p. 817 In 1907‚Äì1910, he served again as Charg√© d'affaires at the Japanese Legation in Paris, and in 1912‚Äì1915 served as Japanese Minister Plenipotentiary to Mexico. In 1915‚Äì1916, he took part in a Japanese Red Cross mission in Russia, then suffering from revages of the First World War. In 1917, he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to Belgium, and in that capacity participated in the Japanese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. During that conference, he also served as member of the Commission of Responsibilities, which recommended prosecuting German leaders accused of war crimes. From 1920 to 1927, he served as Ambassador to Belgium, and in 1927‚Äì1930 he was Ambassador to France.Permanent Court of International Justice, Seventh Annual Report, pp. 21-22 On September 25, 1930, he was elected to serve as judge at the Permanent Court of International Justice.

He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1932. He died Amsterdam, Netherlands, on December 28, 1934. During his tenure as President of the court, most of Adachi's rulings were in line with the majority opinions of the court, except for his ruling in September 1931 regarding the proposed Customs Union between Germany and Austria. As the majority opinion viewed that step as contravening the obligations of the German and Austrian governments not to compromise their own independence, Adachi claimed in his separate opinion that: :\\"Restrictions on its liberty of action which a State may agree to do not affect its independence, provided that the State does not thereby deprive itself of its organic powers\\". His argument was that the proposed economic union did not compromise Austria's independence, just as membership in the League of Nations did not constitute a violation of that independence despite the practical restrictions it imposed on each one of its member states.Permanent Court of International Justice, Customs Regime between Germany and Austria (Leiden, 1931) pp. 74-87: Dissenting Opinion of Adachi, Kellogg, Baron Rolin-Jaeqemyns, Sir Cecil Hurst, Sch√ºcking, Jonkheer van Eysinga and Wang Funeral of Adachi Mineichir≈ç on January 3, 1935, in The Hague.

He was first recorded in the 1940s by folk music researcher Alan Lomax and, over subsequent decades endeared himself to the English folk- song revival movement. Jordan was awarded the English Folk Dance and Song Society's highest honour, the Gold Badge, \\"for distinguished and unique contributions to the folk performing arts\\" in 1995. Early life Jordan was born in Ludlow, the youngest of 5 children. His date of birth has been given in various sources as 16 October 1922 but this is an error arising from Peter Kennedy's inaccurate date of birth published in an old EDFSS magazine and repeated also on Fred's first LP sleeve. At the age of 6 he won a ¬£1 prize for his singing of \\"The Gypsy's Warning\\". At the age of 14 he left school to work as a farm labourer for three shillings (¬£0.15) per week. He learnt his songs from his father and mother, fellow farm workers and travelling families, supplemented with some from printed sources. His repertoire included songs which had been handed-down by the oral tradition from as far back as the era of Samuel Pepys and from the music halls of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He mainly sang these songs in pubs. First recordings Following the war Jordan was working for a blacksmith who heard that Alan Lomax was in the area, searching for songs in the way that Cecil Sharp had some 50 years earlier, and suggested that Lomax should listen to Jordan. Lomax made the first recording of his singing. In 1952 Peter Kennedy, working for the BBC on secondment from the English Folk Dance and Song Society (EFDSS) made further recordings of Jordan on a farm at Diddlebury. Recognition and critical acclaim Following these recordings Jordan became nationally recognised in folk music circles and left Shropshire for the first time in his life to sing on BBC programmes and in live performances at venues as significant as London's Royal Festival Hall. He also toured Scotland at this time. These performances led to him becoming a popular guest artist at folk clubs through the next two decades and appearing at further large concert venues including the Manchester Free Trade Hall. He continued to work as a casual farm labourer, combining fencing, hedging, ditching and harvesting with his new career as a singer. With the growth of folk festivals he appeared before ever- larger audiences at festivals such as Keele, Cambridge, Bromyard and Sidmouth. His signature song became \\"The Farmer's Boy\\" which usually brought his concerts to an end. Jordan's voice was described by Peta Webb as having a \\"beautiful timbre and vibrato\\" and that he could \\"bring out the essence of a song through a wide range of subtle devices\\". Derek Schofield described him as having a \\"subtle and skilful use of melodic ornament\\". Home life Fred remained unchanged by his success and fame, continuing to live a simple life without radio, television or running water at his primitive cottage in Aston Munslow, near Craven Arms. He grew his own vegetables and was fond of his collection of horse brasses. Jordan left his cottage in 2001 to live in a residential home in Ditton Priors due to poor health. He died here at the age of 80 on Tuesday 30 July 2002 following a heart attack. His legacy Jordan's local festival was at Bromyard where he established a tradition of singing the final song of the event, usually \\"A Farmer's Boy\\". Following his death, the organisers of that festival established the \\"Fred Jordan Memorial Competition\\", to honour Jordan's name and to encourage traditional singers up to 25 years old.

After the Austin 20/6 model was introduced in 1927, the first model was referred to as the Austin 20/4. Before 1919 Austins had been expensive prestige cars. In the 1920s there were people who believed the four-cylinder Twenty comparable with if not superior to the equivalent Rolls-Royce. If the coachwork were light enough the Twenty could also give a three-litre Bentley a run for its money. The final inter-war version was the enormous, extremely elegant fast and powerful side-valve Twenty-Eight of 1939. The overhead-valve (25) Sheerline and its companion Princess were to continue the line after the Second World War; however, by the 1930s Austin had lost its aristocratic cachet, having become well known for its Twelves and Sevens.Martyn Nutland, Brick by Brick: The Biography of the Man Who Really Made The Mini ‚Äì Leonard Lord, 2012, AuthorHouse The deceptively potent four-cylinder Twenty found fame at Brooklands both in private hands and with works drivers Lou Kings and Arthur Waite (Herbert Austin's Australian son-in-law and competitions manager). One model policy Before the First World War Austin had produced a range of expensive cars including a 3.6-litre 20-hp car but, influenced by the manufacturing philosophy of Henry Ford, Herbert Austin decided that the future was in mass-producing a single model and chose that size. The Longbridge plant had been considerably enlarged for wartime production, and it was there that the company had a base to put the theory into practice now with the capacity to manufacture 150 cars a week. 1917 Hudson Super Six Phaeton ???

Its overall layout would form a basis for the design of the new one model car policy. The car would, however, prove to be too large for the home market, only about 3,000 Twenties had been sold by July 1920. Massed motor-car production, first British example Perhaps hoping to help The Times published a long item at the beginning of June 1920 in which they professed admiration for Austin's enterprise in launching on the British market \\"a car made on American lines\\". The result, they said, \\"is good but not of the class of the old 20-hp. It would have been wiser to have given the new car a new name. The whole finish is poor. The engine vibrates at anything over moderate speeds and sometimes at low speeds. It is difficult to access the power unit and the whole car is difficult to associate with the 10-hp and 15-hp, the famous 18-hp and the 20-hp which did so well in the 1914 Alpine Trials.Massed Motor-Car Production. The Times, Saturday, Jun 12, 1920; pg. 11; Issue 42435. \\"However it is true the car is an excellent hill-climber, runs very quietly, accelerates rapidly and has very good steering. The (unfortunately) central gear change is good if a shade coarse. The wheel brakes worked by their side lever are excellent\\", but the transmission brake worked by the pedal was described as \\"indifferent\\". \\"The car holds the road well at any speed and the springing is good. The coachwork is comfortable enough but the open body is rather ugly\\". Summing up the motoring correspondent suggested that \\"if pains were taken to damp out engine vibration and a slightly higher price set which would allow more 'spit and polish'...Austin will do a lasting service to the country and to their shareholders\\". Receivership for Austin The one-model policy was rapidly dropped in mid-1921 when Austin's company was placed in receivership. Six months later in November 1921 Austin launched his Austin Twelve, in many ways a scaled-down Twenty. Four-cylinder engine The engine with its 95 mm bore and 127 mm stroke had a cast-iron cylinder block with detachable cylinder head mounted on top of an aluminium crankcase. It developed 45 bhp at 2000 rpm. As an advance on pre-war practice, the engine was directly bolted to the four- speed centre-change gearbox, which drove the rear wheels through an open propeller shaft. The car driven by A E Filby from London to Cape Town and back in 1932 and 1935 Mayfair limousine 3.6-litre 1926 with aftermarket bumper Mayfair limousine 3.6-litre 1926 Chassis The chassis, based on that of the Hudson, was conventional, with semi-elliptic leaf springs on all wheels and rigid axles front and rear. Wooden-spoked artillery-style wheels were fitted. Initially brakes were on the rear wheels, only but front wheel brakes were fitted as standard from 1925 and at the same time the wheels became steel-spoked. Body At its 1919 introduction three body types were listed; a tourer, coup√© and landaulette. These were joined in 1921 by the Ranelagh fixed head, two-door, coup√©. For 1922 the Grosvenor limousine and landaulette, a Ranelagh four-door, fixed head, coup√© and Westminster drop-head coup√© were added. A 75 mph Sports variant was added in 1921 with a modified higher-compression engine and wire wheels, but it was very expensive, and only around 23 were sold. As well as the cars, a range of commercial vehicles was also built on the chassis. By the end of October 1921 Austin were able to advertise that 6,566 Austin Twenty cars were now on the road, 2,246 had so far been delivered during 1921, and that distributors and agents were showing unbounded confidence with their orders for Twenties and the new Austin Twelve, placing large contracts for 1922.

The rear axle was three-quarter floating. =Steering= Steering is worm and worm wheel type. Beneath the hand wheel there is a convenient ring-operated horn switch. =Brakes= Behind the gearbox there was a \\"locomotive\\" transmission brake operated by a hand lever on the off-side of the gear lever. The brake's shoes were to some extent self-adjusting but might be regulated by two hand screws. \\"This brake is intended to be more than just a parking brake\\". The four wheels had brakes operated by rods from the brake pedal. Compensation was made so that balance was preserved in the back and front sets of brakes. The application was partly taken by rods but finally by cables. The brake drums were enclosed and have outlets for water or oil. The front braking mechanism was simple, there was only one arm which had anchorage above the pivot pin and did not turn with the wheel. The cams were at the bottom of the drums and the steering pins were hollowed to allow the necessary expanding control. =Suspension= The front and back springs were half-elliptical. At the back they were carried under the axle. Both sets had lubricating gaiters and shock absorbers. There was no camber to the forward springs. There were no stops behind the back shackles.

New engine July 1938 The new 4-litre engine was announced to a gathering of Austin agents and distributors at Longbridge at the end of July 1938. The design with the alloy cylinder head having proved so successful on the Austin Fourteen it would now be applied across the range. It included a higher compression ratio, \\"upwards of 6 : 1\\" which in combination with the larger inlet valves improved fuel consumption and power output.Austin Car Programme:The Scotsman; 27 July 1938; The cylinder bore was increased by 7 mm from 79.35 to 86.36 mm lifting cubic capacity from 3.4-litres to 4-litres. The tax rating was increased from 23.42 to 27.75 but the power output went up from @2,600 rpm to a reported @3,200 rpm. The previous eight main bearing crankshaft was replaced with a four-bearing crankshaft fitted with a vibration damper which decision fitted with the then current trend. The new detachable aluminium alloy cylinder head was fitted over inclined side valves and anodised aluminium alloy pistons. Pressure lubrication was supplied to the tappets, coolant temperature was controlled by thermostat and coil ignition was provided with automatic advance. Road test A new and roomy seven-seater which has much to recommend it including the price. Unusually good windows, long and fairly deep give a good view and enhance the appearance of the car. The cushions and shaped squabs are comfortable, the compartments are divided by sliding glass panels. There are folding foot rests, blinds to the division window, shaped armchair backs to the seat and a double arm rest in the centre. The occasional seats give reasonable comfort, the doorways behind are wide, the boot has two good-sized fitted suitcases with the spare wheel below and its platform is designed to take 1¬Ω cwt of extra luggage. The new engine has the extra refinement in running noticeable in the other new Austin units and shows much improvement on the former Twenty.

His work was influenced by Japanese artistic traditions, which he had been familiar with since childhood; his father, an art dealer, imported Japanese art in the last decade of the nineteenth century, when it was extremely popular. Ficke wrote several popular treatises on Japanese art during his career, among them Chats on Japanese Prints, published in 1915. Ficke's boyhood home in Davenport. Sticking to traditional styles and forms when modernism was dominating the world of literature and poets were prone to experimentation, Ficke was noted for being \\"in the best sense a conservative force in our poetry.\\"Floyd Dell, \\"The Ficke Wing,\\" Measure, no. 42 (August 1924) : 13. Much of his early work was in traditional meter and rhyme scheme; Sonnets of a Portrait-Painter (1914) is a noteworthy example. Ficke was displeased by what he saw as the inaesthetic nature of contemporary experimentation, which was the main motivation for the Spectra hoax, intended as a satire of modern poetry. His collaborators on the Spectra hoax were fellow poets Witter Bynner (writing as 'Emanuel Morgan') and Marjorie Allen Seiffert (writing as 'Elijah Hay'). Ironically, his experience writing Spectra influenced him to begin experimenting with other forms; Christ in the Desert was his first more modernistic work, without traditional meter or rhyme scheme.

He led numerous campaigns against Loyalists and Cherokee, who in 1776 had launched an attack against frontier settlements across a front from Tennessee to central South Carolina. Williamson was particularly effective in suppressing the Cherokee, killing an unknown number of Cherokees and destroying 31 of their towns.Nadia Dean, A Demand of Blood: The Cherokee War of 1776, Valley River Press, 2012 As a result of his Indian campaign, the Cherokee ceded more than a million acres in the Carolinas. Following the fall of Charleston to the British in 1780 after a month-long siege, and the capture of thousands of American troops, the Patriot resistance was effectively subdued in South Carolina and Georgia. Williamson, like some other officers and troops, appeared to sue for peace. While the circumstances were not clear, he appeared to be aiding the British. He was captured by Americans and gained release, moving from White Hall close to Charleston. There he was taken captive in a second American raid, but freed by British forces. After the war, Patriot General Nathanael Greene testified that Williamson had acted in Charleston to collect intelligence and pass it to the Americans; he was the \\"first major double agent\\" in America. Early life, immigration and rise Williamson was most likely born in Scotland. As a child he emigrated with his parents, whose names are not known, to British Colonial America. They settled on the western frontier in Ninety Six, South Carolina, which was called the Long Cane District. Like many other Scots on the frontier, Williamson became a trader, known by 1758 to be supplying cattle and hogs to frontier forts. He may also have driven cattle to Charles Town to market. He bought a plantation, called Hard Labor, near a creek by the same name, and in Greenwood County near the settlement of Ninety Six. He renamed it as White Hall. He also purchased slaves to work the property. It was one of the few large plantations in this area. Much of the backcountry was being settled by Scots and Scots-Irish subsistence farmers, many of whom were Loyalists in the Revolution. Williamson was contracted to build a fort at Ninety Six, and later he built Fort Charlotte on the Savannah River toward North Carolina. Williamson married Eliza \\"Betty\\" Tyler of the prominent Virginia family, and they had four surviving children together. She died in 1781 during the Revolutionary War. In 1760, he was commissioned as lieutenant in the colonial militia, a step up to the officer corps for a man most sources agree was likely illiterate. In the early 1760s, he participated in a couple of expeditions against the Cherokee, who were raiding and harassing settlers. He supported defeating and enslaving the Cherokee. He became highly influential by the time of the Revolution, having been promoted to the rank of major, established continuing relations with Henry Laurens and other colonial leaders, and served on provincial commissions. In 1774 and 1775, he was elected to South Carolina's Provincial Congress with other men from Ninety-Six District, including Francis Salvador and Richard Rapley. Revolutionary War service At the start of the American Revolutionary War, Williamson fortified his plantation, which he later used as his military headquarters, and as a fort, prison and arms depot. (The British added to the star fort in the settlement, as they considered this an important strategic location and wanted to control it.) There were numerous Loyalists in this part of the state. At this time, the settlement of Ninety Six had about 10 houses, a jail and a courthouse, with a total of about 100 settlers living in the area. In November 1775, Williamson led militia in what was called the Battle of Williamson's Fort, the first battle of the Southern Campaign here, to recapture gunpowder and ammunition hijacked by Loyalists. His call attracted 532 Patriots, but soon 1500 to 2000 Loyalists were gathering outside the village against them. The forces reached a truce and casualties were light. Williamson's men were aided by their temporary fortifications at his plantation. The open warfare tended to harden loyalties and enmities in the interior areas became vicious. Several months later Williamson led troops in the Battle of Twelve Mile Creek on August 1, 1776, in response to Cherokee attacks throughout the frontier since June, in which hundreds of warriors ranged across a front, attacking settlers in Virginia and the Carolinas. Williamson's forces were ambushed five times. They regrouped, gained reinforcements and during the fall, attacked the Cherokee again, making a coordinated attack with the North Carolina militia's Rutherford Light Horse expedition.Cherokee Expeditions; Carolana.com; retrieved May 2016 The South Carolina militia destroyed the Cherokee towns of Esseneca, Keowee, Estatoe, Tugaloo and others of the lower towns. The militia also destroyed the food stores of the people in every town. The Indian campaign gathered increasing force. Williamson was commissioned as a colonel to lead a related campaign in North Carolina, commanding 2300 men and destroying the Cherokee town of Topton in Cherokee County. In September 1776 Williamson petitioned the South Carolina legislature to allow his men to enslave Cherokee taken as captives; while the measure had some support, the legislature rejected it, worried about potential effects on the colony's men. From the Patriots' view, Williamson's campaigns against the Cherokee were a success; they petitioned for peace and ceded more than a million acres of land in what is now the counties of Anderson, Pickens, Oconee and Greenville in South Carolina. Alexander Chesney wrote that they destroyed 32 of the Cherokees' 62 towns. In 1778 Williamson was commissioned as a brigadier general in the militia. That year the Southern Campaign was heating up and he took part in the third Florida-Georgia expedition against the British in Florida. the first two expeditions had been failures. They intended to take the city of St. Augustine. Williamson commanded three militias and went to battle with three other commanders on the Patriot side. While they suffered short rations and a high rate of desertions on the lengthy expedition, Williamson was known to have supplied his troops better than the others. He was well liked as a commander and the Cherokee called him ‚ÄúWarrior Beloved Man.‚Äù Fall of Charleston Charleston fell in 1780 after a month- long siege and 5,000 American troops were captured. Most people felt that South Carolina and Georgia were effectively finished. \\"This event seemed to all, except the boldest spirits, to be the end of the struggle in that part of South Carolina, if not in the whole State. The British regarded the country as not only conquered, but subdued.\\" They established a garrison at Ninety Six, which had effectively surrendered, and developed an earthen star fort there. Williamson had been at Augusta, where the British avoided battle. He queried his forces, and most of the officers and men wanted to accept British terms and take parole. The British were trying to dismantle the opposition by offering the rebels parole and protection, if they promised not to take arms against the Crown again, nor incite others to do so. Some more prominent officers and men they wanted to send to Caribbean islands for the duration. Williamson returned to White Hall and carefully approached the British. Other of his comrades sought \\"peace\\", although surrender was not discussed. Williamson wanted to stay at his plantation, but he was considered a prize by the British. He was said to try to persuade other leaders in South Carolina to follow his lead, specifically Pickens, Hammond, Bowie and Rapley. Historian Llewellyn M. Toulmin's conclusion based on the documentation and Williamson's actions is that he had taken protection and was assisting the British, including supplying them. Several other leading officers sought peace with the British. Some later returned to the Rebel side, angered as the British tried to have senior officers rally younger men against the American cause. In addition, Loyalists had caused damage in the district and aroused hostility. His former compatriots considered Williamson a traitor. They twice took him prisonerthe first time to persuade him to reconsider, but he regained his freedom. He moved closer to Charleston, where the British gave him a plantation. Williamson was taken prisoner a second time, by a raiding party led by Colonel Isaac Hayne. They were intercepted within 24 hours by a British column, who freed Williamson and took Hayne prisoner.The Oxford Essential Dictionary of the U.S. Military., Oxford University Press, Inc., 2002. \\"Williamson, Andrew (1730?‚Äì1786)\\", website of www.answers.com, Retrieved 2009-11-03Benson John Lossing.

Footnote 3, pp. 506-507 \\"[T]he British hanged Col. Hayne on 4 August 1781 because he (like Williamson) had given his pledge to the British to not fight against them. Unlike Williamson, Hayne had violated his parole (in the eyes of the British) by taking up arms again\\" so they hanged him as an example. This brought more notoriety to Williamson. He stayed within the British lines until the end of the war. After the war, the South Carolina General Assembly voted to confiscate Williamson's White Hall plantation. In a published list of those who were to lose their properties, Williamson was classified among eleven \\"obnoxious persons\\" for his actions. But, Patriot General Nathanael Greene testified that Williamson was not a turncoat but had been providing intelligence on the British to the Continental Army, and the former general was able to recover some standing.LLEWELLYN M. TOULMIN, \\"Backcountry Warrior: Brig. Gen. Andrew Williamson\\", Journal of Backcountry Studies, Vol. 7 No.1, Spring 2012 He was not able to return to his beloved White Hall, however, since it was too dangerous for him to live upcountry. (White Hall eventually disappeared and has been the object of a to-date unsuccessful search by descendants, state and Federal archaeologists.) Williamson died in Charleston in 1786.

She was named Western Lady III on her entry to civilian service, as a passenger motor vessel for Western Lady Ferry Service. From 2009 to 2015, she operated as The Fairmile for Greenway Ferry on their day cruise route from Torquay and Brixham to Dartmouth and Greenway. In May 2013, she was returned to her original wartime appearance. Torbay's \\"ferry wars\\" forced her removal from service, and in December 2015, RML 497 was acquired by the National Museum of the Royal Navy. Design The Fairmile is a wooden hulled passenger vessel. Her hulls-form is very fine for a vessel of her type; it is based on a destroyer hull, albeit much smaller, as her original speed was some 20 knots. The hull is split into watertight compartments, the midships compartment is the engine room, housing twin Gardner diesels, and an aft compartment contains the toilet facilities. The main deck has a forward open passenger deck. Aft of this, the forward deckhouse contains a chart room. In the centre of the main deck is a raised open deck area, surrounding the funnel, and with the open flybridge above the chartroom. Aft of the funnel is the main passenger lounge, originally the sick-bay, now named \\"Churchill's\\", in honour of Winston Churchill. The saloon is decorated with memorabilia of Churchill, including his profile etched on the side windows, and contains a bar. Both of the deckhouses are surrounded by an open passenger promenade deck. At the stern of the vessel, the former open deck has been enclosed with an awning. History War service A Fairmile B Motor launch RML 497 was built to the standard Fairmile B motor launch design, and was one of around 650 of the class built. The design was very adaptable, being fitted with pre-drilled rails for different uses ‚Äì the Rescue Motor Launch (RML) type of which around 50 were built, including RML 497, were fitted with a sick-bay aft of the funnel ‚Äì the present lounge. RML 497 was built in 1941, and commissioned in July 1942. She was originally stationed with the 62nd ML Flotilla, based at Portland, Dorset, then in January 1944 was transferred to Kirkwall, in the Orkney Islands, being used for anti-submarine target towing. In August of the same year she was sent to Appledore, North Devon. She was later transferred to the 69th Flotilla at Felixstowe, before being decommissioned at the end of the war, and sold at Itchenor in Chichester Harbour. Western Lady Ferry service The Western Lady Fleet laid up in the winter of 2005. Western Lady III is on the right In 1946, Mr Edhouse of Totnes purchased four of the RMLs, and converted them for use as passenger vessels on a ferry service from Torquay to Brixham, across Torbay in South Devon. The ferry had been run up until 1934 by the Devon Dock, Pier & Steamship Co, but had then lapsed, due to the vessel used, SS King Edward failing her boiler survey. The four RMLs were named Western Lady, Western Lady II, Western Lady III and Western Lady IV. All were re-engined, as their original engines used a fuel with too high an octane value for passenger service; in any case, the original Hall-Scott Defender Petrol engines had been removed prior to sale by the Admiralty and returned to the USA under the World War II lease-lend agreement. This reduced their top speed from 20 knots to 14 knots. In addition to the ferry service, the Western Ladies were also used on excursions, especially to the River Dart. The company was sold in 1963, to Torbay Boat Construction Co Ltd, of the Dolphin Boatyard in Galmpton, with little effect on the operation, though the launches were a familiar sight at the Dolphin Boatyard for their winter layup ‚Äì in the summer the whole fleet was moored on buoys in Brixham Harbour. In 1967 Western Lady III spent some time running cruises around Dublin Bay, under the sponsorship of the Irish Government. In 2003, the two remaining operational Fairmiles; Western Ladies III and IV were supplemented on the Torquay ‚Äì Brixham ferry by the more modern and . This arrangement lasted until the end of the 2006 season, when the Fairmiles were withdrawn, following the closure of the Princess Pier landing stage in Torquay, which was used by the Fairmiles; the more manouevrable Princesses use the fish quay inside the harbour, which is inaccessible to the Fairmiles. Swanage service Western Lady III, by now the last Fairmile Passenger vessel (The Western Lady IV became a yacht), was bought in 2007 by Fairmile Classic Cruises, who operated her from Swanage in Dorset on circular cruises along the Jurassic Coast, and to Yarmouth, Isle of Wight. By early 2009, the company had run up debts, and the vessel had been impounded by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). The owners of Greenway Ferry inspected her, and were given less than 24 hours to buy her by the harbour master, to avoid her being sold at auction to pay off the debts. This was achieved, and the Western Lady III returned to Brixham. Greenway Ferry service After a brief call in Brixham, Western Lady went to Polruan in Cornwall, where she was given a major (¬£35,000) refit, to return her to MCA standards, and to refurbish her passenger accommodation in Art Deco style. She was renamed The Fairmile to avoid confusion with the services of Western Lady Ferry Service, and to emphasise her history. In August 2009, she returned to Torbay, undertaking a series of 'Welcome Home' sailings, with the guest of honour being one of her wartime skippers, Eustace 'Mac' Mackmurdo, aged 93. A Winston Churchill impressionist was also present, who gave a speech. The Fairmile replaced on the day cruise route from Torquay via Brixham then along the coast to Dartmouth, and up the River Dart to Greenway Quay. Her additional capacity was needed on the route, as the competing service operated by was withdrawn after the 2008 season, and in addition, the National Trust opened Greenway House to the public for the first time in 2009. As the landing stage at Princess Pier, in Torquay is no longer safe for use, The Fairmile moors inside the harbour on Princess Pier, whilst she moors overnight on a buoy in Brixham Harbour. In May 2013, she returned to service after an over-winter refit which saw her returned to her wartime appearance including 'English Channel' camouflage paint scheme and original service number. In July 2015, Greenway Ferry announced that their Torbay operation, including the Fairmile, had been sold. They claimed unfair competition, owing to Torbay Council's subsidy of another ferry.

The station was referred to for exactly one century by an identical name to its neighbour, 'Reading', until 1949. Seven years after its opening the station expanded its uses by becoming the terminus of a new company's Waterloo to Reading line from London Waterloo station. This mid-length line added to the town's connections with more intermediate stops, beyond nearby Wokingham and mid-south parts of Surrey which had been directly served by the station and added a competing service, approximately one third longer in distance to a London terminus than the adjacent Great Western Railway. The station closed for all purposes in 1970 when its demolition began. It was adjacent to, and to the south-east of, the Great Western Railway's Reading General station known since the other station's closure as Reading railway station. Part of the latter's 1989-built concourse is on the site of the west end frontage of the demolished other station. History Construction and early years The original route of the South Eastern Railway (SER) was from London Bridge station to Dover, which took a route through so that several compass point sector-based companies could share the same lines and engineering (including a substantial tunnel) through the North Downs. The line from Reading to Redhill was built by the Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway (RG&RR;), and was opened in 1849: the section from Reading to Farnborough was opened on 4 July 1849, with the last section being opened on 15 October. From the start, the RG&RR; was worked by the SER, which leased it from 16 July 1846, and absorbed it in 1852. When the first section of line opened, the SER trains served a temporary station north of Reading's Forbury Road before moving into a permanent terminal, about west, on 30 August 1855. Reading had been served by the Great Western Railway (GWR) since 1840. The competing 1855 SER station was west of Vastern Road, on the corner of Blagrave Street and Station Road, adjacent to but south-east of the GWR station, and at a lower level. The Staines, Wokingham & Woking Junction Railway (SW&WJR;) opened a line between the existing London to Windsor line station of in Middlesex (today in northern Surrey) and in Berkshire on 9 July 1856; the SW&WJR; was worked by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), and they were authorised to run over the SER into Reading. In this way Reading gained a service into London Waterloo station. The SW&WJR; was absorbed by the LSWR in 1878. The original station did not last long, since it was destroyed by fire in 1859 after being struck by lightning. A replacement was built, which had two platform faces; it was enlarged in 1896 by the provision of two more faces following the resiting of the locomotive shed. At the opening, there were four trains a day to (then known as Reigate Junction), two of which continued to ; a through service to London Bridge began in 1852, and in 1853, two more were added. The middle period A 1909 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Reading Southern (shown here as S.E.& C. STA.) In 1899 the South Eastern Railway handed over its operations to a new organisation co-owned with the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR), which traded as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SE&CR;); the line and station continued to be owned and maintained by the SER. In 1923, the LSWR and SER amalgamated, together with other railways including the LCDR (and thus the SE&CR;), to form the Southern Railway (SR), which assumed complete control of Reading station and its approaches. In 1900, there were ten trains each weekday from Waterloo to Reading; by 1914 there were 14, and in 1922, 18. The services tended to be irregular, until the electrification of the inner suburban lines from Waterloo during 1915‚Äì16 brought a clock-face pattern to those services, in order to make it easy for people who did not understand timetables; the steam-hauled services, such as those to Reading, had to fit in (there were eight electric trains per hour on the Reading line as far as ) and so became more regular. During the Dunkirk evacuation (27 May-4 June 1940), 293 special trains arrived at Reading from the Channel ports, most of which were handed over to the GWR. After the War, there was only one train from Reading to London via the SER route, the 7.27am to London Bridge, which arrived at 9.49, and the 5.25pm return, arriving back at Reading at 7.59. Three coaches sufficed between Reading and Redhill; but by 1960, six were required. The locomotive was normally a Schools class 4-4-0 based at Redhill. At Nationalisation, the Southern Railway effectively became the Southern Region of British Railways, and things continued more or less as before; but the station (originally named simply Reading) was renamed Reading South on 26 September 1949, to distinguish it from the adjacent Western Region (ex-GWR) station (which became Reading General at the same time). Later years and closure Reading Southern station, with U class 2-6-0 No. 31616 from Redhill 1962 The 1989 concourse of Reading railway station now occupies the site of the SER station Reading South was renamed again on 11 September 1961, becoming Reading Southern. The station remained independent of Reading General for several years following Nationalisation, but was transferred to Western Region control in March 1965; within a few months the two stations shared a common station manager. Soon the new management decided to spend ¬£250,000 on improvements at Reading General, which included works to divert the Waterloo and Guildford services into the latter station, which would allow the Southern station to be closed. In the station's final arrangement, there were four platforms; east of Vastern Road were a locomotive depot on the north side of the line, and a goods shed and sidings on the south side. The passenger station was closed on 6 September 1965, with services being diverted into Reading General; most (including all the electric services) then used a newly built platform 4A at the latter station, which was long enough for an eight-coach train. It was intended that the non-electric (Guildford line) services would use the older platforms at Reading General; but in practice, these used platform 4A as well. Freight continued to be handled until September 1970, when all goods services were withdrawn except for the Huntley & Palmers biscuit traffic, which lasted until April 1979. After demolition the site of the passenger station was used as a car park for Reading General. In 1989 a new concourse for Reading station was built on the site, and no trace now remains of the former SER station. Connections between the SER and GWR routes The first connection, in length, was laid in from some sidings on the north side of the GWR line, burrowing under that line, connecting with the SER line facing east; none of it was owned by the SER: the LSWR owned the easternmost and the GWR the remainder. It connected into the GWR main line to the west of the station, and since there were no platforms on the connection, it was primarily used for goods trains, being first used on 1 December 1858. A second connection was built to the west of the first one, and was opened on 17 December 1899. This was quite steep. A third connection to the east of the previous two was opened on 26 May 1941, and like the second allowed trains stopping in the GWR station to run to or from the SER line. When the SER station closed in 1965, the connection built in 1899 was relaid to allow the services over the former SER line to run into the newly built Platform 4A at Reading General. Locomotive depot The SER built an engine shed adjacent to the station in 1852. It was replaced by another structure in 1875, and re-roofed in the early 1950s. Like the station, it closed in 1965. The 1875 depot was constructed on the north side of the line, situated to the east of Vastern Road between the SER and GWR lines. It had a brick-built shed, with three tracks, one of which was used by the LSWR. The turntable was replaced in 1926 by one of diameter. On 15 October 1898, the SER had 22 locomotives allocated to Reading. Normally, about twenty locomotives were based at Reading; the allocation fell from 22 to 17 upon electrification in 1939. Locomotive classes allocated in 1950 were mostly ex- SECR types: they included eight 2-6-0s of the SR U class; seven 4-4-0s, mostly of the SECR D class; and two 0-6-0T shunting engines of the SECR R1 class. The duties of the two tank engines included piloting the station, shunting the goods yard and banking goods trains up to . Following Nationalisation, the code 70E was allotted to Reading depot in 1950, which it retained until 1959, when it became a sub-shed of Basingstoke. The depot was reduced in importance in May 1954, when most of the locomotives were transferred away leaving just two shunting engines, but complete closure did not occur until January 1965. Electrification A 2-BIL unit. Trains of this type were built for Reading-Waterloo services Since 1903 the Southern Railway and its constituents had pursued a policy of electrification, which began with the routes closest to the London termini and gradually worked outwards. On the LSWR's Waterloo to Reading Line, electric trains had reached on 25 October 1915 and on 30 January 1916; was reached (the Hounslow Loop Line) on 12 March 1916. The policy was continued by the Southern Railway from 1923, and on 6 July 1930, electrification was extended to Windsor, which included the Reading line as far as . Electric trains reached on 3 January 1937, and in that year, several electrification schemes were proposed by the Southern Railway, which included the route from Virginia Water to Reading. As part of these works, new berthing sidings were provided at Reading. The electric service from Waterloo to Reading was introduced on 1 January 1939; trains were every 20 minutes at peak times and every 30 minutes off-peak and on Sundays. Most trains ran non-stop between Waterloo and Staines, and on the outward journey they divided at Ascot (with one portion continuing to Guildford via ), whilst on the London-bound trip, the two portions would be combined again at Ascot. The total journey time from Waterloo to Reading was reduced from 90 minutes to 75. New electric trains were built for these services, which consisted of two-coach units; up to four units could be coupled to make a train of up to eight coaches. Each coach of a unit had the seating in compartments, flanked by a driving cab at one end and a lavatory at the other, and there was a side corridor (although there were no gangway connections between the coaches); this was to allow the passengers access to the lavatory. One of the coaches had both first- and third-class compartments, and seated 24 in first-class and 32 in third; the other coach had only third-class, seating 52, but also had a brake section for the guard and luggage, together with the traction motors. The units were known as the \\"2-BIL\\" type. The electric trains bore headcodes to inform both passengers and staff of the route, origin and destination of the train, but not necessarily the direction. Several were used: for example, in March 1939, trains running between Waterloo and Reading bore number 27 if running via Brentford, or 28 if running via Richmond. The main codes remained unchanged for several years but there were occasional amendments particularly for special trains; in the 1950s, specials between Reading and were no. 18, and in 1961, specials between Reading and Bognor or were no. 41 if running via Ascot, Aldershot, Guildford and ; or 42 if via , and Havant. If the train was equipped to show only letters as headcodes instead of numbers, letter L was used for all services between Reading and Ascot or Waterloo, sometimes with two dots or a bar above the letter to denote different destinations or routes. The sidings at Reading were used to stable electric trains overnight and at off-peak hours; for example, in Summer 1955, six 2-BIL units would be left in the sidings overnight. Dieselisation A \\"tadpole\\" unit, narrow end toward camera. This is at platform 4B (now platform 5) of the present Reading railway station; the car park on the left occupies the site of Reading Southern railway station. Unlike the line to Waterloo via Bracknell, the North Downs Line to Redhill was not electrified beyond Wokingham, apart from short stretches shared with other routes. The first Beeching report recommended curtailing the passenger service at Guildford and the closure of all stations between Shalford and Betchworth inclusive. The second Beeching report recommended that the whole of the North Downs Line should be developed as a trunk route for freight services. The passenger service along the entire line was however reprieved, provided that costs could be reduced. The steam-hauled services were to be withdrawn, but money was not available for new Diesel trains. Instead, in 1964, six three-car trains were provided by putting together spare coaches from elsewhere on the network: twelve came from disbanded 6-S units on the Hastings line, six of which had Diesel engines and driving cabs; there were also six driving trailers from 2-EPB electric trains available. One coach of each type was coupled together to form a three-car unit; these were officially designated the 3-R units, but were popularly known as \\"tadpoles\\" because the former EMU driving trailer was noticeably wider than the two Hastings coaches. The Diesel service was introduced between Reading and on 4 January 1965. The Redhill line timetable was totally recast; there was no longer a London service, and most services now ran all the way to . The service was second-class only, with a normal off-peak service interval of 60 minutes. Most trains consisted of one \\"tadpole\\" unit, but a few services were operated using BRCW Type 3 Diesel locomotives hauling three ordinary coaches. Accidents On 12 September 1855, a light engine (i.e. an engine running alone, without a train) was sent from Reading to Guildford on the down line, even though it was to travel in the up direction. After running for about a mile, it collided with the 4.40 pm service from London Bridge to Reading, which was running correctly on the down line. The driver of the light engine and four passengers were killed; ten more were seriously injured, and three of those died later in hospital.

On May 22‚Äì23, 2013, he was interviewed by VG for 30 hours, 1 minute and 44 seconds, setting a Guinness World Record for the longest interview ever, beating the previous record by over four hours.http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10116824 Career Born in Mo i Rana, Lahlum grew up in R√∏d√∏y, a small community that he did not find enjoyable; he called his own childhood \\"gloomy\\". Lahlum finished his cand.philol. degree (master's degree) in history from the University of Oslo in 2002, including subjects in political science and history of religion. Since completing his studies, he has at times been a lecturer and advisor at the Lillehammer University College. Biographies and history books His first biography was a 560-page book on former prime minister Oscar Torp, which was published in 2007. The history book on the US presidents was published in 2008. The biography included regular biographical coverage of each president's policy, but also more \\"tabloid\\" coverage about matters such as relationship trouble and drinking habits. The conservative website Minerva credited the book as a good, well-written reference work, finding most of the book to be well balanced. It was more critical of the coverage on George W. Bush, which it found unbalanced. Lahlum was in contact with the former Labour Party secretary Haakon Lie in the last years of his life, and worked with Hilde Harbo on publishing Lie's book Slik jeg ser det n√• in 2008. In 2009 Lahlum published a full 848-page biography on the then late Lie, entitled Haakon Lie. Historien, mytene og mennesket (Haakon Lie, the history, the myths and the person). The book debunked several of the negative rumors surrounding Haakon Lie, including allegations that Lie was a CIA agent. The biography also found that Lie was highly critical of Thorbj√∏rn Jagland, Yngve H√•gensen, Trond Giske and Helga Pedersen. In 2013 Lahlum's biography of H√•vard Vederhus (1989-2011) was published. Vederhus was a former leader of the School Student Union of Norway and a Workers' Youth League member who was killed at Ut√∏ya during the 2011 Norway Attacks. The book was titled Et kvart liv (literally translated: \\"A quarter of a life\\"). Crime novels Lahlum published his first crime novel, The Human Flies (In Norwegian: Menneskefluene), in 2010. The next novels in the series were Satellite People (Satelittmenneskene) in 2011 and The Catalyst Killing (Katalysatormordet) in 2012. The novels are written in classical style, take place in the late 1960s, and feature inspector Kolbj√∏rn Kristiansen as the protagonist, assisted by the young and disabled Patricia Louise Borchmann. Politics Politically, Lahlum represents the Socialist Left Party (SV) and became the leader of the county chapter in Oppland in February 2010. He has also served as leader of SV's local chapter in Gj√∏vik. In the 2017 Norwegian parliamentary election he was their top ballot candidate in Oppland. Chess player and organizer Lahlum is an active chess player with a FIDE rating of 2204 as of November 2009, having been an International Arbiter since 2000. Lahlum played in the top section of the Norwegian Chess Championship in 2001, and was in the sole lead after four rounds, but a string of losses left him at +3=2-4 and 10th place in the end. Lahlum plays for the chess club in Porsgrunn, and has been captain for his club in team chess events. He is otherwise well known for organizing and arbitrating several tournaments. He was editor of the Norwegian Chess Federation's publication Norsk sjakkblad in 2006. Lahlum's style in organizing tournaments is also original, with round reports featuring a description of every game played, player portraits, and grading each player's performance.  World record interview  In early May 2013, it was announced that Lahlum would cooperate with Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang in an attempt to set a world record for the longest interview ever made, setting their goal at 30 hours. Interviewing would be experienced journalist and interviewer Mads Andersen. On May 22 at 11:00, local time, the interview began in the lobby of the newspapers main office in Oslo, with the public allowed to visit and watch the event during the opening hours. It was also shown live on the newspapers own internet television channel, VGTV, where it had more than 370 000 viewers during the broadcast. The following day, at 13:00:05, local time, they beat the previous record, which was 26 hours and 4 seconds, but was set to reach their goal of 30 hours. On May 23, at 16:01:44 local time, the interview was ended by Andersen, simply saying: \\"Hans Olav Lahlum, thank you very much for the chat.\\", having just finished their last topic, US presidential elections from 1912 to 2012. While the new record was first stated to be 30:01:15, it was later made official as 30 hours, 1 minute and 44 seconds, as the digital clock on-screen next to the stage had been started 30 seconds too late after one of the breaks.http://www.vg.no/rampelys/artikkel.php?artid=10116824 During the 30-hour interview the two participants had five minutes of break time allocated for every hour, which they were allowed to save up for longer breaks. They were also served food and beverages at regular intervals, which had been pre-selected by the participants themselves, and were allowed to freely stretch their legs during the interview, as long as they didn't stop talking. The longest pause during the interview, excluding the breaks, was only four seconds. During the thirty-hour interview, Lahlum covered a vast number of pre-selected topics, including a near five-hour runthrough of all US presidents, and a two-hour runthrough of all US presidential elections since 1912. The interview has since been made available for free viewing in its entirety online. Full interview. Style Lahlum is known for his unconventional style, which once included letting his beard grow only on the left side of his face. In chess tournaments, Lahlum has on occasion sported large earmuffs. He has profiled some of this eccentricity in chess tournaments he organizes.For example, in () Lahlum profiles his facial expressions, and a self-deprecating description References External links *- Jeg ble feil barn, p√• feil sted, til feil tid [- I became the wrong child, at the wrong time] Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:People from Rana, Norway Category:Socialist Left Party (Norway) politicians Category:Politicians from Gj√∏vik Category:Norwegian chess players Category:Chess arbiters Category:Norwegian historians Category:Norwegian biographers Category:Norwegian male writers Category:Male biographers Category:Norwegian male novelists Category:Norwegian crime fiction writers Category:Norwegian mystery writers Category:21st-century Norwegian novelists Category:Norwegian Noir writers ","title":"Hans Olav Lahlum"},{"id":"24946250","text":"Bellerophon (, Belleroph≈çn) is an ancient Greek tragedy written by Euripides, based upon the myth of Bellerophon. Most of the play was lost by the end of the Antiquity, and only 90 verses, grouped into 29 fragments, currently survive. Plot Given the fragmentary state of this tragedy, the plot remains open to conjecture. Most modern critics nevertheless agree on the following storyline. The play apparently began with Bellerophon riding his horse Pegasus carried in the air by the crane. Bellerophon, who seems to have lost everything, lives on an uncultivated land with his father Glaucos and Pegasus. Deeply pessimistic about his condition, Bellerophon eventually believes the gods do not exist. He subsequently decides to reach Mount Olympus, thanks to Pegasus's flying abilities. The motives of such an ascent have remained unclear. Regardless, Pegasus falls with his rider and the wounded Bellerophon is brought to the stage. Having repented for his blasphemous behaviour, Bellerophon dies. References Translations * Euripide, Trag√©dies, vol. 8, 2e part. Fragments.

Originally taking over the club following examinership in 2008, he was banned from the game in 2009 for twelve months. Due to accounting failures, the holding company of Cork City, Cork City Investments Fc Limited, was denied a League of Ireland Premier Division licence and later wound up.  Background  Coughlan first came to local prominence in 1997 when he ran for election to the D√°il as a candidate for the Progressive Democrats in Cork South-Central. He was not elected.  Cork City FC  Takeover and management changes In August 2008, Cork City went into examinership with debts of up to ‚Ç¨1.3 million. The club had two potential buyers, but by the end of September, Coughlan was the preferred bidder. Cork City FC was taken out of examinership on 16 October 2008, with the club being taken over by Coughlan, and within two weeks the club were in the Setanta Sports Cup Final. They won this competition, and received prize money of ‚Ç¨150,000. One of the first of many major decisions made by Coughlan at the club was to sack manager Alan Mathews on 9 December 2008. Mathews later claimed he had been sacked by phone with Coughlan telling him \\"out of the blue\\" that he was no longer a part of the club. Mathews threatened legal action \\\\- but it was not pursued in the courts. After City came out of examinership, Paul Doolin was named manager in January 2009. Winding-up order In May 2009, the club were issued with a winding up order over unpaid taxes to the Revenue Commissioners. The club needed to raise ‚Ç¨400,000 in a few weeks to keep the club from being wound-up. Despite raising some funds by selling some players, it was not enough, and the club was wound up on 27 July 2009. The club however successfully appealed the decision with the announcement of a friendly (and expected gate receipts) with Scottish club Celtic. Around this time an issue arose before a game against St Pats in which the bus company would not take the team to the match - because the company had not been paid to do so. This resulted in what a player described as a \\"humiliating\\" plea from the team, as they sat stranded near the bus, on radio station Cork's 96FM for urgent donations from the general public to get them to the game on time. Ban and closure In response to his management practices, the FAI banned Coughlan from all football related activities for a year. On Thursday 17 December 2009, the FAI held a meeting, in which they were to accuse Coughlan of \\"bringing the game into disrepute\\". This meeting had been intended to take place on Monday 7 December 2009, but Coughlan was granted two adjournments. On the day of the rescheduled meeting, Coughlan and his solicitor left FAI headquarters, as they had been \\"left waiting an hour for proceedings to begin\\". Upon leaving, Coughlan was contacted by the FAI, who offered him to return or for the meeting to take place via video. Coughlan however refused, and as the maximum allowable adjournment had elapsed, the Independent Disciplinary Committee held the meeting in his absence. He was sanctioned with a one-year ban from football related activities, along with a ‚Ç¨5,000 fine. Coughlan later appealed this decision in the High Court, bypassing the FAI's appeal system. On Wednesday 26 January 2010, Coughlan lost this appeal, as the judge ruled that it was not a public matter. Justice John Hedigan referred to this as the \\"latest episode\\" in \\"the sad saga of Cork City's financial difficulties\\". Coughlan subsequently complied with the FAI ban, and stepped aside as chairman of the club. Following his departure as chairman, the Cork City supporters group, backed by the investment firm Quintas, approached Coughlan for a takeover of the club. This takeover however ultimately failed - with responsibility for the failure (and ultimate winding up of the club) leveled at Coughlan by Quintas.

Controversy In 2019, a largely-anonymous group of early-career researchers pledged to boycott the annual meeting of the European Society for the study of Human Evolution, a group led by Hublin, in the wake of allegations that he had pursued an extra-marital affair with a graduate student, \\"made sexual advances on other women at scientific conferences\\", dismissed a postdoctoral researcher out of jealousy over the researcher's partner, and bullied other researchers \\"around issues of intellectual property and co-authorship\\". In response, Hublin denied the allegations, calling them \\"a toxic mix of half-truths, professional rivalry, and conspiracy theory propagated by people who have no clue\\".; via Scientific work Hublin has dedicated most of his career to the study of Middle and Late Pleistocene hominins, and in particular, to the biological and cultural evolution of Neandertals and to the origin of modern humans. He has also conducted fieldwork in various sites in Europe and North Africa. He also is the president of the European Society for the study of Human Evolution. The origin of the Neandertals Hublin‚Äôs research initially focused on the origin of Neandertals, and in early 1980s, he used cladistic methods to demonstrate that this extinct lineage of humans was rooted much earlier than was thought at the time. He demonstrated that none of the European fossil material predating 40,000 years ago could be related to modern human ancestry.Trinkaus, E., Shipman, P., 1992. The Neandertals: Changing the Image of Mankind. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., New York His views on Neandertal evolution were later fully confirmed by various discoveries, in particular, by the spectacular discovery of the fossil series from Sima de los Huesos (Atapuerca, Spain). He is best known for having proposed the ‚Äòaccretion model‚Äô for the emergence of the Neandertals, a model that emphasizes the role of the environment, demographic fluctuations, and genetic drift in recent human evolution. This model has found much support in subsequent paleogenetical works. North Africa and the origin of Homo sapiens Another major focus of his research is on the origin of modern humans in Africa, specifically North Africa, where he has been conducting fieldwork for several years. In particular, at the site of Jebel Irhoud (Morocco), he has discovered important new fossil hominins, which document the emergence of our species more than 300,000 years ago and reveal that early Homo sapiens were not only represented in sub-Saharan Africa. The fate of Neandertals Hublin's demonstration that modern behaviors were present in the very last Neandertals was a major contribution to the field. His work on Late Neandertal sites, such as those of Saint-C√©saire and Arcy-sur-Cure (France)(list of Neandertal sites), provided evidence for the late survival of Neandertals in Europe after the arrival of modern humans and the beginning of a genuinely ‚ÄúUpper Paleolithic‚Äù culture on the continent. He was one of the first to promote the ‚Äúacculturation hypothesis‚Äù, which seeks to explain the cultural evolution of the latest western Neandertals through the distant influence of the first modern populations already present in central Europe. Virtual paleoanthropology In 1992, Hublin published the first application of virtual manipulation for the reconstruction of a human fossil from multiple pieces. Since then, he has further developed these techniques which provide new insights into the understanding of the anatomical evolution, cognitive development, and life history of our ancestors and their extinct relatives. His group provided new evidence on diverse issues such as the timing of brain development in early representatives of the genus Homo, the birth process of Neandertals, and the dental development of early Homo sapiens and Neandertals.

At the age of 14 she started her vocal studies at the Athens Conservatoire and trained as an opera singer, namely a lyric soprano. Concurrently, using the stage name \\"Yovanna\\", she was broadcasting on the National Radio with the Greek Radio Light Music Orchestra, thereby putting in jeopardy the scholarship that the Athens Conservatoire had awarded her, as this sort of activity was strictly forbidden. In a graduate contest with fifty contestants, and just one year before obtaining her diploma, she won the leading role of Margit in the operetta \\"Where the Lark Sings\\" by Franz Leh√°r. The following year she took her degree with honours and was awarded a state scholarship to continue her studies in Rome at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. However, this never materialized as the scholarship was finally given to another applicant for some unspecified reason. It was then that Yovanna decided to move into popular music. She started participating in Greek and international song festivals in the early 1960s and after receiving the first prize in the Sopot International Song Festival in Poland she launched her international career, becoming extremely popular in the Soviet Union and particularly the Republic of Georgia, giving hundreds of sold-out concerts at theatres and sports arenas and selling millions of records. At about that time Yovanna began collaborating with the Radio of Geneva, Switzerland, and as its representative, she gave concerts named \\"Musique aux Champs-√âlys√©es\\" at many concert halls all over Europe (France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium). In 1965, Yovanna took part in the Swiss Eurovision selection event with the song \\"Non, √† jamais sans toi\\" and was chosen as the country's representative in the tenth Eurovision Song Contest, held in Naples on 20 March.ESC National Finals 1965 Performed as the last song in the contest, \\"Non, √† jamais sans toi\\" finished in eighth place of the 18 competing entries.ESC History 1965\\"Non, √† jamais sans toi\\" at diggiloo.net Yovanna continued recording and performing, mainly in Greece and Germany, until the early 1980s, when she made the decision to devote herself to writing. She initially wrote volumes of poetry, and in 1986 published her first novel \\"ŒÜŒΩœÑŒµ Œ≥ŒµŒπŒ±\\" (pronounced: Ande yi√°, translated as \\"Take care\\") which became a bestseller in Greece and was subsequently made into a successful film and a theatre play. Up to now she has published twelve novels, some of which have also been adapted for television, and five poetry collections. In Georgia and Russia Yovanna is still considered a living legend. In 2011 during a solemn ceremony at the Rustaveli National Theatre the Mayor of Tbilisi bestowed honorary citizenship on Yovanna. In 2017 the Georgian Ambassador in Greece awarded Yovanna with a state certificate of appreciation in recognition of her extraordinary contribution to strengthening history ties between Georgian and Greek Peoples. In 2015 Yovanna returned to Moscow after 30 years of absence and participated in a concert at the Moscow International House of Music performing to a full house of enthusiastic audience.

However after 1960, the CHP had also been identified as a social democratic party. SODEP, being a party in the same tradition, was also a social democratic party with a strong emphasis on laicite. The party logo was the olive branch. History Background After the coup of 1980, all political parties were dissolved by the military government (ruling through the National Security Council or ) regardless of their political views, on 16 October 1981. For approximately one and half year, there were no political parties. Finally, the MGK decided to allow the formation of new parties with severe restrictions. The new parties were not allowed to use the names of former parties and senior politicians were not allowed to be charter member of the new parties. Furthermore, the MGK had the power of rejecting the charter members. Any party without a certain number of charter members was not allowed to run for the election. (This power was called veto power by the newspapers). This gave MGK the power to limit the number of parties that would stand in the coming parliamentary elections. Formation SODEP was founded by former supporters of the banned Republican People's Party (), which is usually credited as the founder of Turkish republic in 1923. But there were many newly founded parties, and it would be very difficult to reach to voters without referring to the names of the former parties and politicians. So, the party's founders asked Professor Erdal ƒ∞n√∂n√º to be the chairman of the party. Erdal ƒ∞n√∂n√º was a world-famous physics professor but he had never been in politics. Nevertheless, he was the son of late ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º, the second president of Turkey, and his surname was enough to create a sensation. However, ƒ∞n√∂n√º was reluctant and it was difficult to persuade him. Finally, on 26 May 1983 he founded SODEP.Erdal ƒ∞n√∂n√º: Anƒ±lar ve D√º≈ü√ºnceler cilt 1, ƒ∞dea ƒ∞leti≈üim, ƒ∞stanbul,1996 pp. 234-237 Some of the other charter members were T√ºrkan Akyol, Oktay Ek≈üi, Cahit K√ºlebi, Cahit Talas.Turkish parliament page Elections of 1983 21 charter members of SODEP, including ƒ∞n√∂n√º, were rejected on 23 June by the MGK. The shock was great. But the party was not closed and the founders decided to continue with new charter members.Erdal ƒ∞n√∂n√º: Anƒ±lar ve D√º≈ü√ºnceler cilt 2, pp 327-342, ƒ∞dea ƒ∞leti≈üim, ƒ∞stanbul,1998 pp. 327-342 The new chairman was Cezmi Kartay whose name had not been rejected. But due to ensuing vetos, the party was unable to qualify to enter the parliamentary elections (like most of the other parties) which was held on 6 November 1983. In this election, most pre- coup CHP voters cast ballots for the People's Party (). The HP won 30.5 percent of the vote and became the main opposition party to the victorious ANAP. Elections of 1984 After 1983 elections, the MGK lost its former veto power, and Erdal ƒ∞n√∂n√º became the chairman of the party for the second time, on 18 December (just 42 days after 1983 elections). SODEP quickly qualified for the next elections, which were the local elections on 21 March. In this election, while SODEP finished second with 23.4 percent of the vote, the HP received only a modest 8.8 percent. It was clear that the choice of ex- CHP voters was SODEP - although the HP was still the main opposition party in parliament. Merger with HP There was a considerable public pressure on both parties to merge. Erdal ƒ∞n√∂n√º and Aydƒ±n G√ºven G√ºrkan, the new leader of the HP, met and agreed on a plan to merge the parties. On 3 November 1985, SODEP merged with the HP. ƒ∞n√∂n√º agreed to give up his seat during the merger. The new party formed by this merger was named the Social Democrat People's Party () with the abbreviation SHP which resembled that of CHP and a party flag with 6 arrows which resembled that of CHP. The abbreviation SHP should not be confused with the same abbreviation used by the similarly-named but distinct Social Democratic People's Party after 2002.

Life Bernard Olabinjo Benson was born on 11 April 1922 in Ikorodu, Lagos State, into an aristocratic family. His older brother T. O. S. Benson (1917‚Äì2008) would become a successful politician. While at secondary school he also learned tailoring, but after leaving school he became a boxer for a brief period, and then a sailor in the Merchant Navy. In 1944, he left his ship in London, where he made his entertainment debut with the Negro Ballet, touring several European capitals. He met his wife, Cassandra (half-Scottish and half-Caribbean in origin), while in Britain, and on return to Nigeria in 1947 they established the Bobby Benson and Cassandra Theatrical Party. Their performances included serious music, where he played guitar and saxophone while his wife danced. Based on the popularity of his music, he formed the Bobby Benson Jam Session, a dance band that played swing, jive, sambas and calypsos. In the 1950s, he expanded his band to 11 members, including a trumpet section, and began playing in the popular highlife style. Their first big hit was \\"Taxi Driver\\", followed by several others. Benson was an entertainer and a comedian as well as a singer, a great performer. He had a show on NTA in the 1970s, where he performed as a stand-up comedian and magician, as well as playing and singing. He became a friend of B.B. King and Hugh Masekela. Benson established the Caban Bamboo, a popular nightclub later converted into the Hotel Bobby. He had several wives, and 10 children. Benson died in Lagos on Saturday, 14 May 1983. Music Bobby Benson started by playing standard big-band music, but later introduced African themes, as a pioneer of Highlife music in Nigeria. His song \\"Taxi Driver\\" became a classic hit in West Africa, covered by several other musicians, blending Caribbean and jazz styles. Other hits were \\"Gentleman Bobby\\" and \\"Iyawo se wo lose mi\\", \\"Mafe\\", \\"Nylon Dress\\" and \\"Niger Mambo\\". Legacy Various prominent musicians started out playing in Benson's band, including Roy Chicago, Sir Victor Uwaifo, Bayo Martins and Zeal Onyia. Victor Olaiya started as a trumpeter with Bobby Benson's band, and became one of the first Nigerian musicians to play highlife with his group the \\"Cool Cats\\". Another player with Benson's band who moved into highlife was Eddie Okonta, with his \\"Lido Band\\". Benson's innovations in musical style also influenced the evolution of popular J√πj√∫ music. \\"Taxi Driver\\", his biggest hit, and \\"Niger Mambo\\", an African melody with the Latin beat, were covered with different interpretations by American artists such as Stanley Turrentine and Jackie McLean. Randy Weston covered \\"Niger Mambo\\" in a solo performance on his 1978 album Rhythms-Sounds Piano, describing the piece as representing exactly what is called \\"high life style\\" in West Africa. Benson also had musical collaborations with the internationally acclaimed and musical legend Eddy Grant, who stayed in Lagos and performed at the Hotel Bobby for many years. This collaboration lasted for many years, allowing Grant to be able to acclimatise himself to the Nigerian culture. Consequently, Grant was able to speak and record many successful songs and albums in Yoruba and Pidgin English.

He served in the navy from 1916 to 1949, then served as an officer in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation until 1959. Early life and background Nave was born in Croydon, Adelaide, the son of Thomas Henry Theodore Nave and Ethel Sophie (n√©e Peterson). His father worked for South Australian Railways (SAR), serving as chief clerk in the office of the Comptroller of Accounts. Thomas was also a long-standing member of the Adelaide Repertory Theatre, initially as an actor and producer, then as business manager, acting secretary, and chairman. He was subsequently made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1948 Birthday Honours for his \\"services in cultural life of Adelaide\\". Eric Nave began working for South Australian Railways as an office boy in his father's office on 8 December 1913, after graduating from Hindmarsh District High School, having received the Junior Certificate, passing the required five subjects, gaining credits in English history and arithmetic. He took the Civil Service Examination in early December 1914, but came 22nd out of 26 in his group. He remained with SAR, and was appointed a junior clerk on 17 May 1915. Royal Australian Navy service On 1 February 1917 Nave joined the Royal Australian Navy, and was posted to the RAN training establishment south of Melbourne, where on 1 March, he was appointed a paymasters' clerk on probation. He served aboard the second-class protected cruiser from April 1917 to October 1918, being confirmed in his rank in May. From 6 October 1918 to 4 July 1919 he was stationed aboard the training ship at Rose Bay, Sydney, then from 5 July 1919 to 30 September 1920 aboard the battlecruiser , where he was promoted from paymaster midshipman to paymaster sub-lieutenant on 1 March 1920, with seniority from 1 February 1919. From 1 October 1920 to 17 January 1921 he was posted to , a depot ship at Sydney. Nave needed to be proficient in a foreign language to gain further promotion. He chose Japanese because \\"extra pay of 6d per day was paid to those qualified in French or German, but those proficient in Japanese received 5/0d\\" ‚Äì five shillings, i.e. ten times the rate for French or German. He was based in Japan from February 1921 to April 1923, and was then examined by the officials of the British Embassy in Tokyo and awarded the highest pass mark (91%) ever recorded by them, also receiving promotion to paymaster lieutenant on 1 September 1921. He returned to service at sea aboard from April 1923 to January 1924, and was then was attached to the staff of the Rear Admiral Commanding HM Australian Fleet. Royal Navy service In August 1925 Nave \\"loaned\\" to the British Royal Navy. He was sent to Hong Kong and posted to the heavy cruiser . Nave expected to be employed as an interpreter, but instead was presented with intercepted coded Japanese naval signals and ordered by the Commander-in-Chief, China, to break them. Within two months Nave had not only broken the code, but had also worked out the Imperial Japanese Navy's radio protocols and relay system, and the organisation of their various commands. He also broke another code before his period of loan service was completed in October 1927. The loan was promptly renewed in December 1927 and Nave was assigned to the Japanese desk in the Government Code and Cypher School in England. There he broke the code of the Japanese naval attach√©, which meant that during London Naval Conference of 1930, the Admiralty were fully aware of the Japanese negotiating position, and also the Japanese Navy's strategy for fighting a war with the United States. Nave had been promoted to paymaster lieutenant-commander on 1 September 1929, and on 29 August 1930 \\"in view of his exceptional qualifications and experience in certain specialist duties\\" he was transferred to the Royal Navy. This required an Order in Council from the Privy Council because of the different systems of pay and pensions in the two services. Nave was the first officer to be transferred from the Royal Australian Navy to the Royal Navy. Nave's codebreaking career continued, serving in the China Fleet and in London. He was promoted to paymaster commander on 30 June 1937, and assigned to the code-breaking unit of the Far East Combined Bureau (FECB), a tri-service intelligence organisation based in Hong Kong. There his team successfully broke a series of Japanese naval codes until the introduction in early 1939 of \\"Naval Code D\\", designated by the US Navy \\"JN-25\\". By early December 1939, FECB had been relocated to Singapore, and the code was beginning to relinquish some of its secrets. However, the pressure of work had begun to take its toll on Nave's health, and in early 1940 he was diagnosed as suffering from tropical sprue, and was sent back to Australia to recuperate. Sick, and with a \\"heavily pregnant\\" wife, he did not want to return to Singapore. On medical advice Nave did not return to the tropics instead setting up a small RAN cryptographic unit in Victoria Barracks, Melbourne. The unit had a core of naval personnel, with a number of university academics and graduates specialising in classics, linguistics and mathematics, e.g. Athanasius Treweek and Arthur Dale Trendall. In May 1941 Nave's unit was combined with personnel from the Australian Army and designated the Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB). They had some successes, reading Japanese diplomatic traffic from South America, and also breaking JN-4, the operational code for submarines. In early 1942 SIB became part of the \\"Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne\\", (FRUMEL), an \\"inter-naval\\" (joint American- Australian-British) cryptographic unit, and moved to the \\"Monterey\\" apartment building in Queens Road. FRUMEL was commanded by USN Lieutenant Rudolph Fabian, formerly of Station CAST in the Philippines. Despite continued success (Nave had warned, a month before it happened, that the Australian base at Milne Bay, at the eastern tip of New Guinea, was to be invaded in late August 1942, so the base was reinforced, and the subsequent Battle of Milne Bay was decisively won by U.S. and Australian forces ‚Äì the first time the Japanese had been defeated on land by the Allies) Nave was reportedly forced out of FRUMEL and \\"Monterey\\" by Fabian, who apparently regarded him as a \\"security risk\\", because Nave wanted to cooperate with the \\"inter-army\\" unit, the Central Bureau, based at Brisbane. According to his staff, Nave often kept keys to new codes passed on by the Americans and British to himself, which might have been acceptable as a training exercise in peacetime, but not in time of war. Treweek said: \\"We always looked forward to his day off. We'd get the keys to his safe and find all this material in there.\\" Nave also had difficulties with his superior, Commander Rupert B. M. Long, the Director of Naval Intelligence, whom he considered a man of no great ability. Nave subsequently joined Central Bureau in early 1943. Joe Richard, a Central Bureau veteran, said later that \\"[i]f Fabian did not want Nave, the U.S. Army codebreakers were very happy to have him ... Fabian's dislike of Eric Nave was very fortunate for us. Nave became an indispensable person\\" in \\"reading air-to-ground messages containing the weather\\" which \\"gave away the intended target for the day.\\" Nave also created a system of field units to intercept operational messages and advise field commanders of Japanese movements and intentions, a model of successful integration of intelligence with operations. Nave was promoted to the acting rank of captain on 12 October 1944. When Central Bureau moved forward to the Philippines in 1945, Nave was left behind to write the unit's official history and to close down the organisation in Brisbane. Post-war career Nave was loaned back to the Royal Australian Navy from 1 January 1948 until 17 March 1949, when he retired from the Royal Navy. Nave joined the newly-formed Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, as Senior \\"C\\" officer on 20 October 1949, with identity card No. 000113. On 19 October 1950 he was appointed Assistant Director \\"C\\" Branch, investigation & research, and on 1 October 1957 became the Regional Director for Victoria, until eventually retiring on 18 March 1959. Nave was eventually recognised for his work by being appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1972 New Year Honours. Personal life Nave had four children with his first wife, Helene Elizabeth Ray. He married his second wife, Margaret McLeish Richardson, in 1972. Publications Nave co-authored a book with James Rusbridger, which was to have been published in 1988. However, the book was withdrawn after pressure from the D-Notice Committee. It was eventually published in 1991 as Betrayal at Pearl Harbor, but received a highly critical reception from the intelligence establishment. The book apparently reflects Rusbridger's views rather than those of Nave, particularly the claim that Winston Churchill deliberately did not pass on warnings about the attack on Pearl Harbor, in order to get the United States involved the war. According to British historian Peter Elphick, in a 1991 interview on Japanese television, Nave \\"repudiated a large slice of what Rusbridger had written, calling it speculation\\". Dufty said that the Allies had \\"solved\\" the JN-25 code as they knew how it worked; with five numbers, an additive book and an indicator system. But they had not \\"broken\\" the code by having enough code words and indicators to read a message. American military historian Stephen E. Ambrose pointed out that the claim \\"makes no sense at all\\", since if Churchill \\"knew the attack was coming, he certainly would have wanted the United States Navy to meet and defeat it ‚Äì after all, the United States would be fully into the war the moment the battle began.\\" References  Bibliography   External links * Category:1899 births Category:1993 deaths Category:People from Adelaide Category:Linguists from Australia Category:Royal Australian Navy officers Category:Australian military personnel of World War I Category:Royal Navy officers of World War II Category:Australian cryptographers Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:20th-century linguists ","title":"Eric Nave"},{"id":"24946566","text":"Calocucullia celsiae is a moth of the family Noctuidae.

History The facility's origins begin in 1936 as a Luftwaffe airfield, its primary mission being the home of light bomber (Dornier Do 17) and dive bomber (Junkers Ju 87) units until 1942. The Luftwaffe, 1933‚Äì45 About 1940, the Luftwaffe began assigning anti-aircraft (FlaK) units to the area, in order to provide an air defense for the Schweinfurter Kugellagerwerke and other ball bearing factories in Schweinfurt, as the city produced most of these critical components. The number of units assigned increased when the city became the target of American Eighth Air Force strategic bombing beginning in 1943. Schweinfurt was bombed 22 times during Operation Pointblank by a total of 2285 aircraft. American bombing included the Second Raid on Schweinfurt on October 14, 1943, (\\"Black Thursday\\") and Big Week in February, 1944. The United States Army 42nd Infantry Division entered Schweinfurt on 11 April 1945 and conducted house-to- house fighting in the seizure of the city and facilities. Twelfth Air Force B-25 Mitchell medium bombers conducted pinpoint bombing attacks during the battle on German defenses, the battle being one of the last (in addition to Nuremberg) major combat between the German Wehrmacht against American Army units during the Western Allied invasion of Germany. Elements of the USAAF IX Engineering Command were able to move into the airfield on 17 April and clear mines and destroyed aircraft, and made the facility serviceable for use by Allied transport aircraft by 18 April. It was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"R-25\\" and was put to use as a combat resupply and casualty evacuation airfield.IX Engineering Command Advanced Landing Grounds Air Force Occupation units began moving into the airfield on 16 June 1945, the facility being renamed Army Air Force Station Schweinfurt.Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. The airfield became an occupation garrison for Air Force units and also became \\"Schweinfurt Air Depot\\", being used by Air Technical Service Command. It was redesignated as Schweinfurt Air Base on 1 August 1947, in anticipation of the Air Force becoming a separate branch of the U.S. Armed Forces. On 5 October 1947, control of the airfield was turned over to the United States Army as the Air Force consolidated its forces around the Munich area.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . Shortly before closure, the U.S. Army Garrison Schweinfurt was home for roughly 11,000 people, including about 4,000 Soldiers, family members, Department of Defense civilian employees and their dependents, with the heliport being assigned to the Conn Barracks facilities. The installation was closed on September 19, 2014, following a round of base closures in Europe.

It was the first quantity-production hovercraft to be specifically developed for military applications. The prototype performed its first flight in November 1969; the type underwent extensive testing by the Royal Navy. The type performed several military roles, including mine countermeasures, fisheries protection, anti-submarine warfare, search and rescue, border patrol, naval surveillance, and transport duties; a civilian version was also developed. Even before the first BH.7 had been completed, export orders were already being secured for the type. The Imperial Iranian Navy would be a key military operator, having placed multiple orders for models of the BH.7. It was also intended for the Wellington class to be used by civil operators. Development During the late 1950s and early 1960s, British inventor Sir Christopher Cockerell had developed a pioneering new form of transportation, embodied the form of the experimental SR.N1 vehicle, which became widely known as the hovercraft.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 82. British manufacturer Saunders-Roe, whom Cockerell had worked with in order to develop viable hovercraft, soon developed several commercially-viable vehicles, such as the SR.N4, a large cross-Channel ferry capable of seating up to 418 passengers along with 60 cars, and the SR.N6, the first commercially- active hovercraft, capable of seating a maximum of 58 passengers.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 238, 595. The newly-formed British Hovercraft Corporation decided to commit to developing a new hovercraft. Known as the BH.7, it was considerably larger than the preceding SR.N6, and able to carry far greater payloads. Unlike predecessors, the BH.7 was the first quantity production hovercraft to be developed principally for military purposes.Amyot 1989, p. 26. According to the British Hovercraft Corporation, military BH.7 models were capable of performing various coastal security missions, including smuggler interdiction, search and rescue operations, border patrol, naval surveillance, all with a greater degree of mobility and speed than conventional alternatives. It was proposed to outfit the type for the anti-shipping role via the installation of anti-ship missiles such as the French Exocet.Amyot 1989, p. 27. Author J.R. Amyot observed the BH.7 to present highly favourable characteristics for amphibious operations and the mine countermeasures mission, noting its low noise output, high controllability, and low footprint pressure as positive attributes of its design.Amyot 1989, pp. 27-28. The project received substantial support from the British Government, although not all commitments made would be fulfilled. During 1968, it was announced that plans for a version of the BH.7 for the British Army had been terminated; this cancellation heavily impacted the company's design team, as it had coincided with a separate government decision to halt work on a feasibility study into developing large ocean-going hovercraft. Such moves did not led to a complete elimination of state support from the venture as the Ministry of Technology had placed an order for a single BH.7, which greatly facilitated the launch of a Navy-orientated version. Design The British Hovercraft Corporation BH.7 is a considerably larger hovercraft than the preceding SR.N6. Dependent on configuration and equipment fitted, each vehicle weighs around 60 tonnes and a payload capacity of roughly 15 tonnes; its civil version was reportedly designed to accommodate a maximum of eight cars and just over 70 passengers. In a military context, payloads could alternatively consist of palletised freight, up to six M101 howitzers or three Ferret armoured cars; a maximum of 92 fully-equipped troops could be transported by a single BH.7. Typically, a military operated vehicle would be operated by a crew of five, comprising a pilot, a navigator/radar operator, an engineer/gunner, a dedicated gunner, and a commanding officer; most of the crew would be seated within the craft's centrally-located control cabin, which provides all-round visibility. Various weapons could be fitted upon the BH.7 to satisfy customer requests. It could accommodate the fitting and use of various guided missiles, including the Seacat surface-to-air missile, along with the SS.11 anti-tank guided missile, and the Exocet anti-shipping missile; numerous calibres of machine guns and the crew to operate them could be stationed around the vehicle as well. Installing armaments and other specialist equipment adds overall weight, thus separate combat-orientated and logistics-orientated variants of the BH.7 would be constructed. On assault-focused craft, the central space normally occupied by the main hold for logistics use would instead be repurposed for the operations room. The BH.7 featured an integrated lift-and-propulsion system, which was powered by a Bristol Proteus gas turbine engine, capable of generating a maximum of 4,250hp.Amyot 1989, pp. 26-27. To improve engine reliability, considerable research went into the adoption of new materials with greater resistance to corrosion even in salty environments. The propulsion system incorporated the world's largest air propeller, spanning 21-foot, at the time of its introduction; manufactured by Hawker Siddeley Dynamics, this four-bladed variable-pitch propeller was composed of an aluminium-fiberglass composite. Studies on the topic of adopt even larger propellers was also conducted by the firm.Wheeler 1971, p. 142. A 21-foot centrifugal fan forms the core of the lift system. These features combined facilitated the craft's cruise speed of around 60 knots; although this would be reduced to roughly half when traversing rough seas. The BH.7 had benefitted from the company's latest advancements in flexible skirt design. Specifically, it was furnished with considerably longer fingers than prior hovercraft; this design change had reportedly resulted in the BH.7's specific power requirements being noticeably lower in comparison to many earlier vehicles.Amyot 1989, pp. 18, 333. The skirt featured a higher outer hinge line; according to the periodical New Scientist, this refined skirt design was able to achieve a greater degree of both stability and safety, improving the craft's handling at sea; the firm's development efforts had also focused on reducing the skirt's maintenance costs.Wheeler 1971, p. 140. The skirt is primarily composed of a specially-developed synthetic neoprene-coated nylon. Many of the BH.7's systems and mechanisms draw upon those of the preceding SR.N4. During its design, considerable emphasis was placed on ease of maintenance; thus, a large proportion of repairs can be performed in the field, while a team of six maintenance workers would be typically required to service the craft. To increase the time between maintenance intervals, most of the materials used throughout the craft are corrosion-resistant; the structure is largely composed of reinforced plastics. Operational history Iranian BH.7, circa 2013 The prototype BH.7 Mk.2 first flew in November 1969 and was evaluated by the Royal Navy, being allocated the pennant number P235 and aircraft serial number XW255. It was trialled in a number of different roles from 1970 until 1983, including mine countermeasures, fisheries protection, and anti-submarine warfare, typically operating from RNAS Portland but also performing several overseas deployments as well; these tests helped the Royal Navy to determine its hovercraft requirements.Yun and Bliault 2014, pp. 327-329. The prototype was later acquired by the Hovercraft Museum at Lee-on- Solent. By January 1968, Iran had placed an order for a pair of BH.7s, as well as for the smaller SR.N6. A total of two BH.7 Mk.4s and four BH.7 Mk.5As would be operated by the Imperial Iranian Navy during 1970s. The British Hovercraft Corporation considered the Middle East to be a key sales area for the type; a sales drive was targeted towards both Iran and Saudi Arabia.Yun and Bliault 2014, p. 332. Following the Iranian Revolution of 1979, Iran became unable to acquire spare components and support from overseas due to the enactment of several trade embargoes; however, it has been able to continue to operate its hovercraft fleet. In the 2010s, its BH.7s have participated in exercises and routine operations alike. Allegedly, Iranian BH7s have been adapted to function as high-speed missile platforms. Furthermore, Iran has reportedly locally manufactured similar vehicles.

This leads to a separation and weakening of the walls of the artery. SCAD is a major cause of heart attacks in young, otherwise healthy women without known risk factors. While the exact cause is not yet known, SCAD is likely related to changes that occur during and after pregnancy, as well as other diseases. These changes lead to the dissection of the wall which restricts blood flow to the heart and causes symptoms. SCAD is often diagnosed in the cath lab with angiography, though more advanced confirmatory tests exist. While the risk of death due to SCAD is low, it has a relatively high rate of recurrence leading to further heart attack-like symptoms in the future. It was first described in 1931. Signs and symptoms SCAD often presents like a heart attack in young to middle-aged, healthy women. \\"Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection Postpartum\\" This pattern usually includes chest pain, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, sweating, extreme tiredness, nausea, and dizziness. A minority of people with SCAD may also present in cardiogenic shock (2-5%), ventricular arrhythmias (3-11%), or after sudden cardiac death. Pregnancy- and postpartum-associated SCAD generally have worse outcomes compared to other cases. Causes Risk factors include pregnancy and the postpartum period. Evidence suggests that estrogen- and progesterone-related vascular changes affect the coronary arteries during this period, contributing to SCAD. Some case reports and case series suggest associations with autoimmune inflammatory diseases, but there have not been larger studies to explore this relationship. Underlying heritable conditions such as fibromuscular dysplasia and connective-tissue disorders (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndrome, and Loeys‚ÄìDietz syndrome) are associated with SCAD,Dhawan R, Singh G, Fesniak H. (2002) \\"Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: the clinical spectrum\\". Angiology but SCAD otherwise lacks a significant genetic component. SCAD triggers may include severe physical or emotional stress, but many cases have no obvious cause.Mark V. Sherrid; Jennifer Mieres; Allen Mogtader; Naresh Menezes; Gregory Steinberg (1995) \\"Onset During Exercise of Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection and Sudden Death. Occurrence in a Trained Athlete: Case Report and Review of Prior Cases\\" Chest{http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/spontaneous-coronary- artery-dissection/basics/risk-factors/con-20037794} Pathophysiology SCAD symptoms are the result of a restriction in the size of the affected coronary artery. The dissection leads to a collection of blood, or hematoma, between the layers of the artery wall. The hematoma does not carry oxygen to the heart muscle but instead forms a \\"false lumen\\" that restricts the flow of blood through the \\"true lumen\\" to the heart muscle. As yet, there is no consensus on why the hematoma develops in the first place.Virmani R, Forman MB, Rabinowitz M, McAllister HA (1984) \\"Coronary artery dissections\\" Cardiol ClinicsKamineni R, Sadhu A, Alpert JS. (2002) \\"Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: Report of two cases and 50-year review of the literature\\" Cardiol Rev The restriction limits the availability of oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle, or myocardium. As a result, the myocardium continues to demand oxygen but is not adequately supplied by the coronary artery. This imbalance leads to ischemia, damage, and eventually death of myocardium, causing a heart attack (myocardial infarction). Heart attacks can classically present as chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, pain in the upper abdomen, and a radiating pain extending along the left arm or the left side of the neck. Diagnosis This is a representative video of coronary angiography. While it does not display SCAD, it highlights the technique used to identify the condition. Given the demographics of SCAD, it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion for the condition in otherwise low-risk women presenting with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. Initial evaluation may show ECG changes of ST elevation, like heart attacks due to other causes. SCAD comprises 2-4% of all cases of acute coronary syndrome. With typically elevated cardiac biomarkers and ECG changes, people will often undergo coronary angiography evaluation.C. Basso, G. L. Morgagni, G. Thiene (1996) \\"Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: a neglected cause of acute myocardial ischaemia and sudden death\\" BMJ It is important to recognize SCAD through angiography as other confirmatory measures carry increased risks.  Angiography  Angiographic appearances of SCAD fall into three categories. Type 1 lesions appear as classic angiographic dissections, with a false lumen distinct from the true lumen. These are the easiest to identify as SCAD clinically, though relatively uncommon. Type 2 lesions - the most common subtype of SCAD - appear as a long, smooth narrowing of the vessel without a distinctly visible false and true lumen. Type 3 lesions appear similar to atherosclerotic lesions and are difficult to confirm as SCAD through angiography alone, possibly requiring the use of intracoronary imaging.  Intracoronary imaging  This is a representative image of two types of intracoronary imaging, OCT (left) and IVUS (right). Intracoronary imaging (ICI), consisting of intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) can help distinguish SCAD from an atherosclerotic lesion when it is difficult to do so with angiography.Intravascular Ultrasound Imaging in the Diagnosis and Treatment: The Future: IVUS-Guided DES Implantation? ICI techniques provide a direct view of the walls of the coronary artery to confirm SCAD, but may actually worsen the dissection as the probes are inserted into the damaged area. ICI confers a 3.4% risk of iatrogenic dissection in people with SCAD compared to 0.2% risk in the general population. Between the two ICI methods, OCT - a newer technique - has superior spatial resolution than IVUS and is the preferred technique if ICI is required, but the need to inject extra contrast with OCT poses risk for worsening the dissection.  Other methods  Some studies propose coronary CT angiography to evaluate SCAD in lower-risk people, with research into the approach ongoing.  Management  Management depends upon the presenting symptoms. In most people who are hemodynamically stable without high-risk coronary involvement, conservative medical management with blood pressure control is recommended. In these people, especially if angiography demonstrates adequate coronary flow, the most likely course usually leads to spontaneous healing, often within 30 days. In cases involving high-risk coronaries, hemodynamic instability, or a lack of improvement or worsening after initial attempts at treatment, urgent treatment with coronary stents or coronary artery bypass surgery may be necessary. Stents carry the risk of worsening the dissection or have an increased risk of other complications as the vessel walls in SCAD are already weak due to the disease before introducing the stent. Large studies into coronary artery bypass surgery are lacking, but this approach is used to redirect blood to the heart around the affected area for cases involving the left main coronary artery or when other approaches fail.MedHelp:Coronary artery dissection treatment After addressing the SCAD, people are often treated with typical post-heart attack care, though people who are pregnant may need altered therapy due to the possibility of some teratogenic cardiac medications affecting fetal development. Depending on the clinical situation, providers may screen for associated connective tissue diseases.  Prognosis  People with SCAD have a low in-hospital mortality after treatment. However, the lesion may worsen after leaving the hospital within the first month. One study suggested a 1.2% mortality rate following SCAD but a 19.9% risk for either death, heart attacks, or strokes. Even afterwards, SCAD has a high recurrence risk at 30% within 10 years, often at a different site than the initial lesion - meaning that stents placed in the location of the first lesion may not protect against a second. Given the lack of consensus on the cause of SCAD, prevention of future SCAD may include medical therapy, counseling about becoming pregnant again (for those who had pregnancy-associated SCAD), or avoidance of oral contraceptives - as they contain estrogen and progesterone. Epidemiology SCAD is the most common cause of heart attacks in pregnant and postpartum women. Over 90% of people who develop SCAD are women. It is especially common among women aged 43‚Äì52. With angiography and improved recognition of the condition, diagnosis of SCAD has improved since the early 2010s. While prior studies had reported a SCAD prevalence of less than 1% in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome, more recent data suggests the prevalence of SCAD in acute coronary syndrome patients may be between 2-4%. History SCAD was first described in the year 1931, at postmortem examination, in a 42-year-old woman. Due to a lack of recognition and diagnostic technology though, SCAD literature until the 21st century included only case reports and series. With the recent advent of coronary angiography and intracoronary imaging, recognition and diagnosis of SCAD has greatly increased, especially in the 2010s.

She was born to a Chinese mother and black father (an African American according to her), who left China before she was born and has lost contact ever since. Her mother raised her as a single mother. She is currently enrolled at the Shanghai Theater Academy. She entered the Shanghai-based Dragon TV's Go Oriental Angel talent quest in August 2009, where she became one of the five finalists from Shanghai. Dubbed the Black Pearl and Chocolate Girl on the show, her rise to fame culminated in heated discussions in the Chinese blogosphere. While some comments on internet forums expressed support, some commenters insulted Lou and her mother with racist remarks. Her attention in the media opened serious debates about racism in China and racial prejudice. Fame and racist uproar Lou entered Shanghai's Go Oriental Angel program in August 2009 and reached the top-five in the Shanghai region. Initially hosts of the show were baffled by her skin colour and questioned her background and the origins of her father. Through the exposure she received on the show, she gained attention as a human interest story and granted several interviews to television stations. The media attention resulted in mass discussions on the Chinese language internet, but soon spreading to the English language internet and media. On November 1, British newspaper The Guardian reported that Lou had emerged as the most famous talent show contestant in China and has become the subject of intense debate because of her skin colour. She ranked as one of the top 30 contestants before being eliminated from the competition. Rumours flared on cyberspace, allegedly citing a press report, that Lou's mother engaged in an extra-marital affair with an African American, resulting in the birth of Lou. Subsequently, a blog entitled \\"Could Lou Jing's dad be Obama?\\", where the author of the blog used many sarcastic remarks to ridicule Lou, received particular notoriety. Another blog, titled Lou Jing's American black father and Shanghai mother, appeared on Tianya, a popular Chinese internet forum, and garnered over 40,000 hits, with many vicious racist attacks made on Lou based on her dark skin. Racial slurs such as xiaoheigui (Â∞èÈªëÈ¨º xi«éohƒìigu«ê; lit. Little black devil) were made about her. Other bloggers wrote comments such as \\"Numb! This bitch still has the audacity to appear on television! I don't know what to say! One cannot be shameless to this kind of level!\\" Lou initially did not discover these comments on the internet until her friends contacted her with messages of support. She also remarked that it was the first time she has experienced such racial hatred in her life.\\"The whole thing was a big bomb to my family and me, and it caused great harm,\\" Lou told Neteast News on Sept 14. On August 31, 2009, someone posted a \\"Four Point Announcement\\" on KDS (a Shanghai local forum) under the name \\"Lou Jing,\\" which led more controversy to this incident. The post titled \\"I am Lou Jing from ‚ÄòOriental Angels‚Äô, I am making an announcement here\\" claimed that \\"my father is American, not African,\\" and \\"I am a native Shanghainese.\\" The \\"Four Point Announcement\\" later attracted more online attacks against Lou, saying that she is the racist one. However, in the interview with NetEase, Lou Jing proved that the announcement was fabricated. China Daily columnist Raymond Zhou remarked that the backlash on the internet was caused by numerous factors, including China's homogeneity, her \\"non-Chinese\\" appearance and her mother's associations with a foreigner, but more relevantly, her dark skin from her father. Zhou opined that China's intolerance is color-based, where people value lighter skin and thus discriminate against darker skin. He further commented that this trend is \\"not totally race based,\\" as the Chinese are biased against other darker skinned Chinese, especially women, and that he believes this to be an \\"offshoot of class discrimination\\" because historically, lower class laborers who usually worked outdoors often had darker skin due to constant exposure to the sun. Zhou was one of several media commentators in China who responded to the hostile reactions in the blogosphere. Zhou wrote that it was \\"high time [we] introduced some sensitivity training on races and ethnicities if we are going to latch on to the orbit of globalization.\\" Author Hung Huang wrote on her blog, \\"In the same year that Americans welcome Barack Obama to the White House, we can't even accept this girl with a different skin colour.\\" In the mainstream Chinese media, Lou Jing also had many supporters. In an interview with Chinese internet portal Netease, Lou discussed her background and how her skin colour has affected her since childhood. She responded to a hoax declaration widely circulated on the internet that proclaimed in her name that her father is \\"American, and not African\\". She replied, \\"Isn't it kind of stupid to say it now since China is America's biggest creditor?\\" When asked whether she agrees about being \\"a native of Shanghai\\", she remarked \\"I'm a Chinese person born and raised in China,\\" adding that her best friends are from Anhui and Henan. She also remarked that she was grateful that her parents gave birth to her, and played down racial discrimination, saying it has been overblown by false press reports. Lou received an internship offer from Shanghai television station Dragon TV after the show. She has since become a co-host of the show News Surfing Intelligence, a local Shanghai program. In an interview with the BBC's Matthew Bannister, she remarked that racial discrimination is present in all countries of the world, but in China it seems particularly focused towards people of an African background due to the assumption that Africa is less developed. She said that she found it interesting children of mixed Chinese- white parents do not receive nearly as much negative attention. Lou Jing is not the first Chinese person of African descent to have received widespread media attention in recent years. In June 2009, the entrance of Ding Hui (), a black man from Hangzhou, to the China men's national volleyball team also gained significant coverage on Chinese media.Ding Hui Documentary Personal Lou Jing has a very close relationship with her mother, a native Shanghai woman. Her mother appeared at all of her shows in support of her. Lou had a timid personality before appearing as a TV contestant, and is sensitive towards outside criticism, though she maintains an air of optimism. Lou Jing speaks fluent Shanghainese and Mandarin.

Because of the completion of the Willamette Locks in late 1872, it was possible for vessels such as Governor Grover to be built in Portland, Oregon and then readily navigate the Willamette above Willamette Falls.  Construction  Governor Grover was built in 1873 for the Willamette River Navigation CompanySometimes this company is seen referred to as the \\"Willamette River Transportation Company\\", for example, in Wright, ed., Lewis & Dryden Marine History, at 206. which had been formed to compete with the monopoly on the river that was then held by the People's Transportation Company, which by 1873 had come under the control of steamboat and stagecoach magnate Ben Holladay. Among the backers of the Willamette River Navigation Company were the important businessman Bernard Goldsmith and the steamboat men Jacob Kamm and Joseph Kellogg, with the latter supervising construction of the Grover.Wright, E.W., ed., Lewis & Dryden Marine History, at 23, 205. Grover was named after La Fayette Grover (1823-1911) fourth governor of the state of Oregon (1870-1877). Other vessels built by the Willamette River Navigation Company included the sternwheelers Vancouver (1870), Beaver (1873), and Willamette Chief (1874).  Operation  Grover was launched on January 28, 1873, and made her first trip on March 16, 1873. Officers at first were Charles Holman, Captain, George Marshall, chief engineer, and A. Vickers and Charles Kellogg, pilots. Shortly after construction Governor Grover passed into the ownership of the Willamette Falls Locks and Canal Company. Governor Grover worked on the Willamette River and, on March 18, 1873, was the first large vessel to go as far upriver as Harrisburg.Mills, Sternwheelers up Columbia, at 103, 143, 194. Grover achieved some success in driving down rates, and became popular among the farmers of the Willamette Valley.Corning, Willamette Landings, at 126 and 184. In 1874 Capt. Holman was succeeded in command by Capt. James Wilson, who remained with the vessel for several years. The Willamette Falls Locks and Canal Company sold Grover to the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, which worked the vessel on all routes running out of Portland, Oregon.  Disposition  In 1880, Governor Grover was dismantled at Portland, Oregon.

The business is based on Achill Island, County Mayo in Ireland, with other centres in the United States. The venture has been described as \\"controversial\\" and as a \\"cult\\", and it has no official status with the Roman Catholic Church. Claims of visions In 1985, Christina Gallagher, a housewife from Co Mayo, was with a group at Cairn's Grotto in Co Sligo where she claims to have seen a vision of the suffering Christ's head. subsequent visions followed. Gallagher has claimed to have had visions of the Virgin Mary since 1988, to be a prophet and to suffer from stigmata on her feet. Gallagher has claimed that her mission to establish a \\"house of prayer\\" as a place where priests and laity would come to prayer and worship together was made clear to her over the course of several visions of the Virgin Mary. She purchased a former convent building on Achill in 1992, and it was opened as the House of Prayer in 1993 by the then Archbishop of Tuam Joseph Cassidy. The venture secured tax exemption from the Revenue Commissioners, and built up a considerable income from voluntary donations. Commission of Inquiry In 1996, Cassidy's successor, Archbishop Michael Neary, established a commission of enquiry to investigate claims of supernatural phenomena arising from the centre. This investigation concluded that no evidence of supernatural events existed but that the persons involved gave every evidence of good faith. After efforts by the archdiocese to \\"integrate\\" the centre into its structures, Gallagher temporarily closed the centre for a time in July 1998, since when it has had no approval or involvement from the Catholic Church. Alleged miracles Among claims made in 2002 of \\"miracle cures\\" were the cases of Fionnula McManus, who claimed that a baby pronounced dead in her womb had come back to life after she visited the House of Prayer,Paul Clarkson and Tom Gillespie, \\"We're Doomed; 5,000 Pilgrims Hear the Virgin Mary's Message about Sin\\", The Mirror (London, England), 26 July 2002 and another, Kathleen O'Sullivan, who claimed that she was cured of pancreatic cancer. Charitable status revoked In 2005, in the course of a crackdown on organisations purporting to pursue charitable aims, the Irish Revenue Commissioners revoked the House of Prayer's tax exemption. In 2006 Gallagher bought her daughter a house worth ‚Ç¨1 million in Ballina, County Mayo. It emerged in 2008 that Gallagher, despite having no visible income, was living in a ‚Ç¨4 million house in Malahide, County Dublin and also owned a ‚Ç¨1 million house in Newport, County Mayo. Comments by Archbishop Neary and Primate of All Ireland In an apology printed by the Irish Mirror newspaper in 2000 the paper acknowledged that it had misrepresented Archbishop Neary in reporting that Mrs Gallagher was 'banned' by the Catholic Church. Neary had stated that \\"Mrs Gallagher never was banned and has never been the subject of any action corresponding to that term and that Mrs Gallagher was and is a Catholic of good standing within the Church.\\" In March 2008 Archbishop Neary said that the centre \\"does not enjoy the confidence of the diocesan authorities\\" and \\"any work carried on since [July 1998] has been entirely of a private nature\\" and \\"carries no ecclesiastical approval whatever\\". Dr Neary added that he respected the faith and devotion of many people who have been impressed by this (House of Prayer) work in the past. A statement issued shortly afterwards by the office of the Primate of All Ireland said that he was \\"involved in ongoing discussions with Fr Gerard McGinnity\\", a priest of the Armagh diocese who reportedly helped raise money for the centre, \\"regarding his involvement with the House of Prayer in Achill\\". Related organisations outside Ireland Funds were also raised through a \\"Confraternity of Our Lady Queen of Peace\\" run in the United States by Gallagher's associate John Rooney. This entity established five US Houses of Prayer in Florida, Ohio, Texas, Minnesota and Kansas, and another in Mexico. In 2009 the Confraternity's income was almost $3 million, and it had assets of $6.7 million. In 2014, it was claimed that funding was created by scaremongering under the pilgrims by claiming that \\"if pilgrims did not provide money for a new House of Prayer in Texas, he would destroy the whole state.\\" and \\" that will save them during the great chastisement is a ‚Ç¨250 picture available in the House of Prayer shop\\". Dispute with donors The centre was investigated by the Garda S√≠och√°na in 2008 after complaints from people who had donated money to it, and it refunded ‚Ç¨250,000 in out of court settlements to donors. \\"More and more\\" followers were said to have become disillusioned following newspaper reports of Gallagher's lifestyle. In March 2009, the Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to take a prosecution against the House of Prayer. Sunday World journalist Jim Gallagher published a highly critical book on the House of Prayer later that year.Jim Gallagher (2009), Immaculate Deception: The Shocking True Story Behind Christine Gallagher's House of Prayer, Dublin: Merlin Publishing, Majella Meade, the chief fundraiser for the Achill House of Prayer, presented 100 complaints against the Sunday World to the Press Council of Ireland during 2009; all were rejected. Archbishop Neary subsequently warned visitors to the House of Prayer to be \\"very careful and circumspect in going there\\". Directors resign In June 2011, all three directors of the limited company resigned simultaneously, but agreed legal terms that prevented them from discussing their concerns with the media. In July 2011 the Sunday World reported that Christina Gallagher had acquired a ¬£2 million \\"mansion\\" in Shropshire, England, using donations from her followers. Nevertheless, John Rooney, Majella Meade and other financial backers had recently broken with Gallagher.Jim Gallagher, \\"The House of War as previously loyal aides quit\\", Sunday World, 17 July 2011 Despite the controversies the venture generated revenues of ‚Ç¨416,263 in 2011, 75% from donations and the remainder from sales of \\"religious objects\\". According to Darrag McDonough, writing in The Times, \\"The company behind the House of Prayer retreat on Achill Island, Co Mayo, bought 5,000 copies of a book by its founder, Christina Gallagher, at a cost of ‚Ç¨100,000 last year.\\"McDonough, Darragh. \\"House of Prayer puts its faith in founder‚Äôs book\\", The Times, October 2, 2017 Controversy In October 2014, a former member asked publicly for the excommunication of Christina Gallagher. Mick Power accused Gallagher of scaremongering, simony and heresy after she and Fr McGinnity claimed that the state would be destroyed when the pilgrims did not fund a new House of Prayer in Texas. They could be saved at the great chastisement by buying a ‚Ç¨ 250 picture.

Ten Special Forces soldiers and their combat cameraman were awarded the Silver Star for bravery, the greatest number of such awards for a single battle since the Vietnam War. In 2018, Special Forces medic Ronald J. Shurer's Silver Star was upgraded to the Medal of Honor for his actions during the battle. In 2019, Special Forces weapons sergeant Matthew O. Williams's Silver Star was upgraded to the Medal of Honor for his actions during the battle. In addition SrA Zachary Rhyner, ODA 3336's attached Air Force Combat Controller, was awarded the Air Force Cross. Insertion The battle plan called for the Afghan commandos led by American Special Forces soldiers to be inserted into the valley via helicopter. From there they would move on foot to the terraced slopes around the fortified town and take the HIG forces by surprise. The coalition's CH-47 Chinook helicopters were unable to land so their soldiers were forced to jump from the hovering helicopters. Due to the austere and barren nature of the valley, HIG forces immediately spotted the incoming U.S. and ANA forces and had several minutes to set up ambush positions. Battle AF CCT Zachary Rhyner in Shok Valley Members of the Afghan 201st Commando Kanak, two months before the battle Upon attempting to infiltrate the stronghold along a sheer-sided agricultural terrace, Staff Sergeant Luis Morales was the first to observe armed insurgents moving along the ridge and opened the first salvo of automatic fire on the enemy.Congressional Record for 11 May 2009, page S5322 and Washington Post, \\"10 Green Berets To Receive Silver Star for Afghan Battle,\\" by Ann Scott Tyson, 12 December 2008 The unit came under heavy fire from HIG rocket- propelled grenade (RPG) and machine-gun positions. The initial salvo of machine gun fire was aimed at the command element of the American forces. Immediately, the unit's interpreter was killed and one of the Special Forces communications sergeants was badly wounded. Now pinned down, the U.S. and ANA forces responded with small arms and sniper fire. After an Afghan commando was incapacitated while attempting to render aid to the wounded and pinned communications sergeant, the ODA's combat cameraman, Specialist Michael Carter, ran through the open to recover the wounded soldier while the element's commanding officer, Captain Kyle Walton, provided cover fire. The two then switched roles in providing cover in order to recover the second wounded soldier. While the lead elements engaged HIG positions, Walton knew he would need close air support and so again provided cover while Carter ran out to recover the unit's communications gear. With communications restored, SrA Zachary Rhyner, the Air Force Combat Controller attached to the ODA, began directing close air support and air strikes from orbiting F-15E Strike Eagles and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters onto HIG targets. Rhyner used the F-15s as observations platforms, their avionics systems acting as reconnaissance tools to maintain visual on enemy positions and movements. While the air strikes were hitting the fortified town, a massive explosion occurred in one of the buildings, causing a temporary lull in the fighting. The rear elements of the Special Forces detachment used this as an opportunity to maneuver into new positions and begin sniper fire on HIG heavy weapons positions. While providing first aid to SGT Behr, the ODA's intelligence sergeant, SSG Luis Morales, was struck in the thigh. Morales applied a tourniquet and returned to giving care. A second shot went through Morales' boot at the ankle blowing out bone and severing the achilles (Morales would later lose his foot). In the ensuing fire fight, SGT John Wayne Walding had his leg nearly severed by a single shot. Walding applied a tourniquet to his leg, autoinjection of morphine and folded his mangled leg upward into his crotch and tied two bootlaces to his belt in order to retain his ability to move and shoot. By this time, the F-15 overhead reported a massive reinforcement element moving in the valley. With daylight running out, several wounded soldiers, ammunition running short and the weather beginning to turn, the ODA began to scout an exfiltration route to an extraction zone. Carter and the ODA's Team Sergeant, MSG Scott Ford, were scouting a route down the sheer terraces when Ford was hit twice by sniper fire, one of the shots nearly severing his left arm. As the combined Afghan and American forces withdrew down the mountain, the ODA's sniper, SSgt Seth Howard, commanding officer and their combat cameraman remained behind to collect or destroy weapons that could not be carried. The ODA sniper, SSgt Howard, covered the last of the withdraw before himself making his way to the extraction zone. In all, the battle lasted for seven hours. The primary target of the action, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, was not captured. According to Rhyner's Air Force Cross citation, over the course of the battle he directed over 50 attack runs using a total of 4,570 cannon rounds, nine Hellfire missiles, 162 rockets, a dozen 500-pound bombs and one 2,000-pound bomb. Special Forces medic Ronald J. Shurer and weapons sergeant Matthew O. Williams were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the battle. Eight other Special Forces Soldiers of ODA 3336 were awarded Silver Stars for their actions. The story of the battle is the subject of the book No Way Out: A Story of Valor in the Mountains of Afghanistan (). Popular culture Episode 3 of Season 1 of the National Geographic Channel series No Man Left Behind is about this battle and aired on July 12, 2016.

It consists of a Headquarters Company, the 265th Movement Control Team, the 355 Terminal Supervision Detachment, the 21st Cargo Transfer Company, the 140th Movement Control Team, and three truck companies, namely the 40th Transportation Company, the 497th Transportation Company, and the 513th Transportation Company. The 57th Transportation Battalion officially inactivated on 15 September 2011 at Fort Lewis, Washington. 40th Transportation Company Stationed in Mannheim, Germany on Grenadier Strasse at an ex-Wehrmacht kasserne designated Turley Barracks by the U. S., the 40th Transportation Company (Medium Truck, Petroleum) operated during the Cold War in general support of 7th Army. The Company had previously been awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. The unit was assigned to the 6th Quartermaster Battalion, also headquartered in the Mannheim area. The 40th's T. O. & E. included 60ea 5 ton tractors and 120ea 5,000 gallon semi-trailers, which enabled the unit to perform shuttle operations, dropping a full trailer and pulling away an empty to be refilled. In addition to providing fuel support to combat units involved in field operations, the unit supplied fuel from tank farms to various fuel stations and military airfields in the 7th Army operating area of Western Europe. During 1963 and 1964 the unit was commanded by 1LT John Clifford, 1LT John Stanford and 1LT John Logan. During Stanford's tour the unit achieved the highest rating of all units in 7th Army for Annual General Inspection. Stanford, a U. S. Army Airborne Ranger, went on to qualify as an aviator who flew Mohawk aircraft on missions in Viet Nam. Ultimately he commanded the Military Transportation Management Command and finally retired as a Major General. 21st Cargo Transfer Company The 21st CTC was constituted in 1926 as the 13th Motorcycle company, Then re-designated as Company \\"A\\" of the 72nd Separate Quartermaster Battalion in 1936, and began training to head out to support the Allied Forces in World War II. The company supported the war effort in Rome-Arno, and Po Valley, until they were disbanded in 1940. (though the unit designation was changed several times in this span). The unit was reactivated at Camp Bowie as the 21st Quartermaster Company on 12 June 1941. Over the next decade the company was re-designated many times until they were finally re-designated on 21 July 1947 as the 21st Transportation Car Company, at which point they began preparing for operations in the Korean theater. The company was one of the first transportation units sent to Korea, and they remained there until well after the war as an occupation force. 21st took part in many missions throughout the war, and received 8 streamers for their contributions. The unit was disbanded once again in Korea on 15 June 1998. On 16 June 2001, the 21st Transportation Company was activated on Fort Lewis, and later re-designated the 21st Cargo Transfer Company. Since 2001, the unit has deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq and the Global War on Terrorism in Kuwait.

The court also held that this ordinance did not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Black held that the decision went against recent doctrine.

He spent most of his professional career in Spain, playing 182 matches (with 18 goals) in the two major levels. In his country, without really settling anywhere, he represented five clubs, totalling only 63 appearances in the Primeira Liga. Club career After impressing as a youngster at Vit√≥ria Sport Clube in Guimar√£es, Agostinho moved abroad aged 20, but his first experience would be a very unhappy one, only appearing twice for Real Madrid Castilla and Sevilla FC combined. He would spend the following three seasons in the Spanish second division, consecutively with UD Salamanca, UD Las Palmas and M√°laga CF; with the latter, in 1998‚Äì99, he teamed up with compatriot Edgar (also newly signed and also arrived from Real Madrid) to propel the Andalusians to La Liga, contributing with 38 matches and three goals. Agostinho continued to appear significantly for M√°laga in the following years, but also had an unassuming loan spell in France with Paris Saint- Germain FC, after which he was released in June 2002. His career was somewhat unnoticeable from then onwards, as he played mainly in Spain's and Portugal's second levels or with modest teams in the top flight, consecutively representing Moreirense FC, Polideportivo Ejido, F.C. Felgueiras and Rio Ave FC. He only played 14 competitive games in two full campaigns with the latter, and was released at the age of 32. Agostinho then moved to the Portuguese third division with C.A. Valdevez, after which he again returned to Spain, joining CF Palencia in the fourth tier and helping it promote in his debut season. He left the club in June 2010 and retired shortly after, at nearly 35.

It is the place where Rev. Fr. Joseph Beschi also famously known as Veeramamunivar wrote the Thembavani in Tamil.  Perianayagi Madha  History The Peria Nayagi Shrine was constructed by the great missionary Constanzo Beschi. Periya Nayagi Shrine The place where the shrine is located was once a forest place in Mugasaparur at Konankuppam. People used to come here for feeding their flocks. There were many trees and bushes here. In the 17th century, the Italian priest and a great missionary, Fr. Beschi, brought two statues of Mother Mary to be kept in the place where he worked, namely Elakuruchi / Thirukavalur (now in Kumbakonam Diocese). He preached all over Tamil Nadu and on the way to his place he happened to pass over this forest and due to tiredness he slept under a tree with the two statues. The boys who were looking after the cattle playfully hid one of the statues behind the bush. Fr. Beschi was shocked to know that one statue was missing and went to his place sadly. Periya Nayagi There was a man called Kachirayar the Zamindar of Mugasaparur. He had no child. Every day he used to pray to God. One day Mary appeared to him in his dream and said, \\"Kachirayar, I'm alone in the forest. If you build a chapel for me, I'll give a child to you.\\" After saying this she disappeared. Hearing this he was very happy and began to search for the statue in the forest. As they cut the bushes and trees, they found the statue behind a big bush. This statue was placed in the shrine, where it still stands. People constructed a small chapel and placed this statue there and began to worship. Pilgrims' Kitchen After some time Fr. Beschi happened to hear about this and came to Konankuppam and saw the small chapel built for the statue which he lost once. He was delighted and decided to make Konankuppam his work place. He constructed the shrine with the help of Kachirayar which exists today. It is said to have been the first place of worship he erected, and when it was completed he went to Madras and asked the Bishop of Mylapore to procure for him a statue from Manila, an image of the virgin, in native dress of Tamil Nadu and bearing the child Jesus in her arms, fashioned after a model he had made. The image eventually arrived and was set up in the church, where it still is today. Fr.Beschi This life-size statue stands on a pedestal about high and is made of wood and painted in bright colours. In honour of it and of the Church, Beschi composed his Tamil poem Thembavani, which vying in length with the Iliad itself is by for the most celebrated and most voluminous of his works. He completed this work in 1726. The Tamil conference conducted in Madurai during 1728 - 1729 AD approved his work and published it for the common good. Nearby shrines  Location  From Chennai it is about 200 km to reach Ulundurpet on the Chennai - Trichy highway. Konankuppam is about 12 km from Ulundurpet via Mangalampet. It is about a 20 minute journey to reach Konankuppam near Mugasaparur (Virdhachalam TK).

Founded in 1532, it has been a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference since 1920. With the girls-only Stamford High School and the coeducational Stamford Junior School, it is part of the Stamford Endowed Schools (SES). History The school was founded in 1532http://www.ses.lincs.sch.uk/page/?pid=313 by a local merchant and alderman, William Radcliffe, who had been encouraged when younger by Lady Margaret Beaufort, (died 1509) mother of Henry VII, though there is evidence to suggest that a school existed from the beginning of the fourteenth century. Founded as a chantry school, it fell foul of the Protestant reformers and was only saved from destruction under the Chantries Act of Edward VI by the personal intervention of Sir William Cecil (later Lord Burghley) who worked in the service of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset and who secured a specific Act of Parliament in 1548 ensuring its survival. Apart from the chantries of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, only those of Eton College, Winchester College, Berkhamsted, St Albans and Stamford schools survived. A 1961 copy of the original Brazenose knocker is mounted on a gate Brazenose House Teaching is believed to have begun in the Corpus Christi chapel of Stamford's twelfth-century church of St Mary, but by 1566 was taking place in the remaining portion of the redundant St Paul's Church, originally built no later than 1152. This building continued in use as a school room until the early twentieth century when it was restored and extended and, in 1930, returned to use as a chapel. In 1961, a nineteenth- century Gray and Davison pipe organ was installed although this was removed in the 1990s and replaced with an electronic substitute. Over its history the school has built or absorbed seventeenth-, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century buildings, besides the site of a further demolished medieval church (Holy Trinity/St Stephen's) and remains of the hall of Brasenose College built by the secessionists from the University of Oxford in the fourteenth century. Brasenose College bought Brazenose House in 1890 to recover the original medieval brass Brazenose knocker. The right of appointment of the school's master, a position hotly contested in past centuries on account of the post's disproportionately large salary, was shared between the Mayor of Stamford and the Master of St John's College, Cambridge. Both Stamford Town Council and St John's College still have nominees on the school's governing body. Stamford School has a sister school, Stamford High School which was founded in 1877. The funds for the foundation of the High School and the further financial endowment of the existing boys' school were appropriated from the endowment of Browne's Hospital by Act of Parliament in 1871. This trust had been established for the relief of poverty by William Browne (died 1489), another wealthy wool merchant and alderman of the town, and his gift is commemorated in the name of a school house. From 1975, Lincolnshire County Council purchased places at Stamford School and Stamford High School on the basis that Stamford had no LEA grammar school (unlike the county's other towns). This local form of the Assisted Places Scheme provided funding to send children to the two schools that were formerly direct-grant grammars.\\"Last stronghold of assisted pupils faces legal threat\\" by Julie Henry, The Daily Telegraph 23 March 2003 The national Assisted Places Scheme was ended by the Labour government in 1997 but the Stamford arrangements remained in place as an increasingly protracted transitional arrangement. In 2006, Lincolnshire County Council agreed to taper down from 50 the number of county scholarships to the Stamford Endowed Schools so that there would be no new scholarships from 2012. In recent years, the two schools have been united under the leadership of a single principal as the Stamford Endowed Schools. This organisation now comprises Stamford Junior School, a co-educational establishment for pupils aged between 2 and 11 years, Stamford School for boys aged 11‚Äì18, and Stamford High School catering for girls of the same age group. Sixth Form teaching is carried out jointly between Stamford School and Stamford High School. Stamford School has four senior (Y10‚ÄìY13) houses. These are called Brazenose, Radcliffe, Ancaster and Exeter. There are also four junior house systems, each the same colour as their senior counterparts, and these are named St Peter's, St Paul's, Willoughby and Cecil. There are also three boarding houses: Byard, for boys aged 11 to 14; St Paul's, for boys aged 14 - 16; and Browne, which houses boys aged 16 to 18. The four junior (Y7‚ÄìY9) houses are Cecil (feeder house to Exeter), Willoughby (feeder house to Ancaster), St Paul's (feeder house to Radcliffe) and St Peter‚Äôs (feeder house to Brazenose). Brazenose and Radcliffe traditionally housed town boys, while Ancaster and Exeter accommodated boys who lived respectively north and south of the River Welland. Additional boarding houses within the Stamford Endowed Schools are St Michael's (boys and girls 8‚Äì11), St Martin's (girls 11-13), Welland (girls 13‚Äì16) and Park (girls 16‚Äì18). Since 1885 The Stamfordian has been the school magazine of Stamford School. Currently published annually in the Autumn term, it provides for current pupils and parents as well as Old Stamfordians and prospective parents an account of a year in the life of the school. The school has rivalries with nearby Uppingham School, Oakham School and Oundle School. School crest The school's crest is a stork with wings displayed on a wool bale over the motto + me spede, that is Christ me spede. The emblem was adopted from medieval wool merchant, William Browne, after the school had been re-endowed from Browne's Charity in 1873. (The stork is supposed to be a rebus on his wife, Margaret's maiden name of Stoke). The current form was designed by Nelson Dawson.

A primary example is the Wainer hierarchy, or L√∂b‚ÄìWainer hierarchy, which is an extension to all Œ± < Œµ0. Such hierarchies provide a natural way to classify computable functions according to rate-of-growth and computational complexity. Definition Let Œº be a large countable ordinal such to every limit ordinal Œ± < Œº there is assigned a fundamental sequence (a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals whose supremum is Œ±). A fast-growing hierarchy of functions fŒ±: N ‚Üí N, for Œ± < Œº, is then defined as follows: * f_0(n) = n + 1, * f_{\\\\alpha+1}(n) = f_\\\\alpha^n(n), * f_\\\\alpha(n) = f_{\\\\alpha[n]}(n) if Œ± is a limit ordinal. Here fŒ±n(n) = fŒ±(fŒ±(...(fŒ±(n))...)) denotes the nth iterate of fŒ± applied to n, and Œ±[n] denotes the nth element of the fundamental sequence assigned to the limit ordinal Œ±. (An alternative definition takes the number of iterations to be n+1, rather than n, in the second line above.) The initial part of this hierarchy, comprising the functions fŒ± with finite index (i.e., Œ± < œâ), is often called the Grzegorczyk hierarchy because of its close relationship to the Grzegorczyk hierarchy; note, however, that the former is here an indexed family of functions fn, whereas the latter is an indexed family of sets of functions \\\\mathcal{E}^n. (See Points of Interest below.) Generalizing the above definition even further, a fast iteration hierarchy is obtained by taking f0 to be any increasing function g: N ‚Üí N. For limit ordinals not greater than Œµ0, there is a straightforward natural definition of the fundamental sequences (see the Wainer hierarchy below), but beyond Œµ0 the definition is much more complicated. However, this is possible well beyond the Feferman‚ÄìSch√ºtte ordinal, Œì0, up to at least the Bachmann‚ÄìHoward ordinal. Using Buchholz psi functions one can extend this definition easily to the ordinal of transfinitely iterated \\\\Pi^1_1-comprehension (see Analytical hierarchy). A fully specified extension beyond the recursive ordinals is thought to be unlikely; e.g., Pr”ßmel et al. [1991](p. 348) note that in such an attempt \\"there would even arise problems in ordinal notation\\". The Wainer hierarchy The Wainer hierarchy is the particular fast-growing hierarchy of functions fŒ± (Œ± ‚â§ Œµ0) obtained by defining the fundamental sequences as follows [Gallier 1991][Pr”ßmel, et al., 1991]: For limit ordinals Œª < Œµ0, written in Cantor normal form, * if Œª = œâŒ±1 \\\\+ ... + œâŒ±k‚àí1 \\\\+ œâŒ±k for Œ±1 ‚â• ... ‚â• Œ±k‚àí1 ‚â• Œ±k, then Œª[n] = œâŒ±1 \\\\+ ... + œâŒ±k‚àí1 \\\\+ œâŒ±k[n], * if Œª = œâŒ±+1, then Œª[n] = œâŒ±n, * if Œª = œâŒ± for a limit ordinal Œ±, then Œª[n] = œâŒ±[n], and * if Œª = Œµ0, take Œª[0] = 0 and Œª[n + 1] = œâŒª[n] as in [Gallier 1991]; alternatively, take the same sequence except starting with Œª[0] = 1 as in [Pr”ßmel, et al., 1991]. For n > 0, the alternative version has one additional œâ in the resulting exponential tower, i.e. Œª[n] = œâœâ...œâ with n omegas. Some authors use slightly different definitions (e.g., œâŒ±+1[n] = œâŒ±(n+1), instead of œâŒ±n), and some define this hierarchy only for Œ± < Œµ0 (thus excluding fŒµ0 from the hierarchy). To continue beyond Œµ0, see the Fundamental sequences for the Veblen hierarchy. Points of interest Following are some relevant points of interest about fast-growing hierarchies: * Every fŒ± is a total function. If the fundamental sequences are computable (e.g., as in the Wainer hierarchy), then every fŒ± is a total computable function. * In the Wainer hierarchy, fŒ± is dominated by fŒ≤ if Œ± < Œ≤. (For any two functions f, g: N ‚Üí N, f is said to dominate g if f(n) > g(n) for all sufficiently large n.) The same property holds in any fast- growing hierarchy with fundamental sequences satisfying the so-called Bachmann property. (This property holds for most natural well orderings.) * In the Grzegorczyk hierarchy, every primitive recursive function is dominated by some fŒ± with Œ± < œâ. Hence, in the Wainer hierarchy, every primitive recursive function is dominated by fœâ, which is a variant of the Ackermann function. * For n ‚â• 3, the set \\\\mathcal{E}^n in the Grzegorczyk hierarchy is composed of just those total multi-argument functions which, for sufficiently large arguments, are computable within time bounded by some fixed iterate fn-1k evaluated at the maximum argument. * In the Wainer hierarchy, every fŒ± with Œ± < Œµ0 is computable and provably total in Peano arithmetic. * Every computable function that's provably total in Peano arithmetic is dominated by some fŒ± with Œ± < Œµ0 in the Wainer hierarchy. Hence fŒµ0 in the Wainer hierarchy is not provably total in Peano arithmetic. * The Goodstein function has approximately the same growth rate (i.e. each is dominated by some fixed iterate of the other) as fŒµ0 in the Wainer hierarchy, dominating every fŒ± for which Œ± < Œµ0, and hence is not provably total in Peano Arithmetic. * In the Wainer hierarchy, if Œ± < Œ≤ < Œµ0, then fŒ≤ dominates every computable function within time and space bounded by some fixed iterate fŒ±k. * Friedman's TREE function dominates fŒì0 in a fast-growing hierarchy described by Gallier (1991). * The Wainer hierarchy of functions fŒ± and the Hardy hierarchy of functions hŒ± are related by fŒ± = hœâŒ± for all Œ± < Œµ0. The Hardy hierarchy \\"catches up\\" to the Wainer hierarchy at Œ± = Œµ0, such that fŒµ0 and hŒµ0 have the same growth rate, in the sense that fŒµ0(n-1) ‚â§ hŒµ0(n) ‚â§ fŒµ0(n+1) for all n ‚â• 1. (Gallier 1991) * and Cichon & Wainer (1983) showed that the slow-growing hierarchy of functions gŒ± attains the same growth rate as the function fŒµ0 in the Wainer hierarchy when Œ± is the Bachmann‚ÄìHoward ordinal. Girard (1981) further showed that the slow-growing hierarchy gŒ± attains the same growth rate as fŒ± (in a particular fast-growing hierarchy) when Œ± is the ordinal of the theory ID<œâ of arbitrary finite iterations of an inductive definition. (Wainer 1989) Functions in fast-growing hierarchies The functions at finite levels (Œ± < œâ) of any fast- growing hierarchy coincide with those of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy: (using hyperoperation) * f0(n) = n + 1 = 2 [1] n ‚àí 1 * f1(n) = f0n(n) = n + n = 2n = 2 [2] n * f2(n) = f1n(n) = 2n ¬∑ n > 2n = 2 [3] n for n ‚â• 2 * fk+1(n) = fkn(n) > (2 [k + 1])n n ‚â• 2 [k + 2] n for n ‚â• 2, k < œâ. Beyond the finite levels are the functions of the Wainer hierarchy (œâ ‚â§ Œ± ‚â§ Œµ0): * fœâ(n) = fn(n) > 2 [n + 1] n > 2 [n] (n + 3) ‚àí 3 = A(n, n) for n ‚â• 4, where A is the Ackermann function (of which fœâ is a unary version). * fœâ+1(n) = fœân(n) ‚â• fn [n + 2] n(n) for all n > 0, where n [n + 2] n is the nth Ackermann number. * fœâ+1(64) > fœâ64(6) > Graham's number (= g64 in the sequence defined by g0 = 4, gk+1 = 3 [gk \\\\+ 2] 3). This follows by noting fœâ(n) > 2 [n + 1] n > 3 [n] 3 + 2, and hence fœâ(gk \\\\+ 2) > gk+1 \\\\+ 2. * fŒµ0(n) is the first function in the Wainer hierarchy that dominates the Goodstein function.

New Zealand Challenge was the first team from New Zealand to enter the competition.  1987: KZ 7 Kiwi Magic  New Zealand entered the America's Cup competition in 1984, when Marcel Fachler, a Belgian then living in Sydney, entered as a challenger following Australia II's victory. Later the campaign's director, former government minister Anthony \\"Aussie\\" Malcolm, brought in Michael Fay to help organize and finance the challenge. The team made use of former US 12 Meter Enterprise (now registered as KZ‚Äì1). The 1986 12 Meter Championships were staged off Fremantle as a precursor to the America's Cup event to be held a year later. KZ 7's sister boats KZ 3 and KZ 5 competed, with KZ 5 finishing runner-up behind the Bond Syndicate's Australia III, which was the comfortable winner. The boat finished ahead of the New York yacht club entry America II, a considerable achievement that made the sailing community stand-up and take notice that the New Zealand challenge was serious. KZ 3 and KZ 5 had been built identically and information gained from racing KZ 3 and KZ 5 went into the planning of KZ 7. All three were designed by Farr Yacht Design, and comprised the first successful efforts of Bruce Farr in America's Cup Racing. Skippered by Chris Dickson, the crew included: Brad Butterworth, Ed Danby, Simon Daubney, Brian Phillimore, Mike Quilter, Tony Rae, Jeremy Scantlebury, Kevin Shoebridge, Andrew Taylor and Erle Williams.America's Cup '87, Aurum Press, 1986. p.25 In 1986 off Fremantle, Australia, KZ 7 was the most dominant boat in the Louis Vuitton Cup rounds robin competition, winning 33 of 34 starts. In the Semi's she swept French Kiss 4 races to nil, and reached the Louis Vuitton Cup Finals, where she lost to Dennis Conner and Stars & Stripes 87. Despite failing to reach the America's Cup as the challenger yacht, the Kiwi challenge drew great attention through their fast boat and capable sailing. KZ 7 later competed in the 1987 World Championships in Sardinia, Italy, with David Barnes as skipper and Rod Davis as tactician. The New Zealanders sailed competitively, and ended up winning the event in the protest room, achieving victory over the Japanese entry Bengal (previously the Bond syndicate's Australia III).  1988: Big Boat Challenge  KZ1 on display Five months after the completion of the Royal Perth Yacht Club's America's Cup competition, Fay issued a challenge to the San Diego Yacht Club. Using a strict reading of the Deed of Gift, Fay realized he could challenge with any yacht that was or less at the waterline and require the defending yacht club to meet him in ten months time. He worked with designer Bruce Farr and Tom Schnackenberg to build a gigantic monohull called New Zealand or KZ 1. The boat was built by Steve Martin in Mt Wellington, Auckland and was launched on 27 March 1988. Skippered by David Barnes with tactician Peter Lester, she was the maximum along the waterline, and was said to be the fastest monohull keelboat in the world at the time. However, as the Deed of Gift was being used to force the competition, the San Diego Yacht Club responded by taking advantage of the vague wording of the Deed and built a catamaran, Stars & Stripes (US 1), for the defense. Conner and his catamaran easily beat the big boat, KZ 1, 2‚Äì0 in the Deed of Gift races. Fay challenged this outcome in court, claiming the defenders were \\"not sporting\\" in sailing a catamaran against his big boat. He won the initial ruling, but the finding of the lower court was overturned on appeal, and the outcome on the water was made to stand. The appellate court decision was then upheld when Fay pressed the issue before the New York State Court of Appeals. KZ 1 can still be seen in the Viaduct Harbour, outside the entrance to the New Zealand National Maritime Museum in Auckland, New Zealand.  1992: Bowsprit Scandal  NZL 14, a trial boat for the 1992 challenge Fay challenged again in 1992 with the distinctively red NZL 20. In competition, New Zealand Challenge had another outstanding effort, and progressed through the regatta to the finals of the Louis Vuitton Cup where they faced Paul Cayard and the Italian syndicate of Il Moro di Venezia. Leading 4‚Äì1 in the series, a protest from Il Moro over NZL 20s use of a bowsprit was upheld. The result of the protest was that Team New Zealand was docked one of its race wins (bringing the series score back to 3-1) and was required to remove the bowsprit. The New Zealand team never recovered from the enforced changes and blow to morale, losing the next 4 races and the series. Managed by Peter Blake, the team was skippered by Rod Davis and NZL 20's crew included tactician David Barnes, bow Alan Smith; mid- bow David Brooke; mast Barry McKay; pit Denis Kendall; floater Mark Hauser; grinders Andrew Taylor and Sean Clarkson; genoa trimmers Kevin Shoebridge and Grant Loretz; mainsheet traveler Don Cowie; mainsheet trimmer Simon Daubney; and running backstays Tony Rae and Peter Evans. Russell Coutts sailed the second boat.https://articles.latimes.com/1991-12-06/sports/sp-425_1_rod-davis Aftermath Following the 1992 challenge Fay declined to fund another attempt. Two teams entered the 1995 Louis Vuitton Cup in their place, Team New Zealand, representing the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, and Tag Heuer Challenge, representing the Tutukaka South Pacific Yacht Club. Team New Zealand won the America's Cup on their first attempt.

Jesus Lived in India, 1983 Jesus Lived in India* Jesus lebte in Indien ‚Äì Sein geheimes Leben vor und nach der Kreuzigung. Ullstein-Verlag, Berlin 1998, , (1. Auflage: Droemer Knaur, M√ºnchen 1983, ). promotes the claim of Nicolas Notovich (1894) regarding the unknown years of Jesus between the ages of 12 and 30 in India. The consensus view amongst modern scholars is that Notovitch's account of the travels of Jesus to India was a hoax. Kersten also promotes Ahmadiyya founder Ghulam Ahmad's claims regarding the years aged 33 to age 120 in India, and the burial of Jesus at the Roza Bal shrine in Srinagar. Kersten also draws on earlier material by Louis Jacolliot, Andreas Fabeer-Kaiser, and German popular novelist Siegfried Obermeier (also 1983).Mark Bothe Die Jesus-in-Indien-Legende √úber eine alternative Lebensgeschichte des Jesus von Nazareth 3 Die modernen Autoren. Wie eingangs erw√§hnt sieht Gr√∂nbold diese Quellen als Grundsteine f√ºr die moderne JiIL an.

For example, a passage in the Bhavishya Purana which refers to Jesus as \\"Isa-Masih\\" (Jesus the Messiah). The passage describes the Hindu king Shalivahana travelling to mountains where he meets a man who calls himself Isa, son of a Virgin. Isa says he has ministered to the Mlecchas, explaining that he has reformed the lives of the mlecchas by recommending principles of mental purity, japa by chanting holy names, and meditation. Kersten interprets this as a record of Jesus in Kashmir. In reality the passage is an 18th-century dialogue also featuring Muhammed, and not an early source as Ahmad claimed.Holger Kersten, Jesus Lived in India: His Unknown Life Before and After the Crucifixion, Penguin Books India, 2001, p.260. Most scholars consider this part of the Purana to be a 19th-century interpolation.See Swami Parmeshwaranand, \\"Christ in the Bhavisya Purana\\", Encyclopaedic Dictionary of PurƒÅnas, Sarup, 2001, pp.278ff; Wendy Doniger, PurƒÅna Perennis: Reciprocity and Transformation in Hindu and Jaina Texts, SUNY Press, 1993, p.105. The book achieved great popularity in Germany and overseas, though competed with the better-known Siegfried Obermeier's book in Germany. The Indologist G√ºnter Gr√∂nbold included a highly critical debunking of Obermeier and Kersten's interpretations of Buddhist sources among various expositions of Jesus in India theories in Jesus in Indien.

Divyanand draws on Kersten' s discredited book, Jesus Lived in India.\\" Wilhelm Schneemelcher in introducing the subject of New Testament Apocrypha (1991) uses Kersten by way of illustration of the development of legendary Gospel traditions and notes how Kersten \\"attempted to work up Notovitch and Ahmadiyya legends with many other alleged witnesses into a complete picture.\\"New Testament Apocrypha: Gospels and Related Writings - Page 84 Wilhelm Schneemelcher, R McL Wilson - 1991 \\"Kersten for example attempted to work up Notovitch and Ahmadiyya legends with many other alleged witnesses into a complete picture26.

Given access to the manuscripts on Jesus Christ, Abhedananda later published an abbreviated version of Notovich's translated account.

Richard, Hooper; Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, and Lao Tzu; 2012 p. 176 The Original Jesus, 1994 In a later work co-written with parapsychologist Elmar R. Gruber (b. 1955), Der Ur-Jesus (1994), translated The Original Jesus (1995) Kersten argues that Buddhism appears to have had a substantial influence on the life and teachings of Jesus.Der Ur-Jesus ‚Äî Die buddhistischen Quellen des fr√ºhen Christentums. Langen-M√ºller Verlag, M√ºnchen 1994, . They hold that Jesus was influenced by the teachings and practices of Therapeutae, described by the authors as teachers of the Buddhist Theravada school then living in Judaea, although the only account, the extensive description by Philo of Alexandria describes them as a charismatic Hellenistic Jewish community following the Law of Moses. Gruber and Kersten assert that Jesus lived the life of a Buddhist and taught Buddhist ideals to his disciples. In doing so their work draws on earlier comparisons between Buddhism and Christianity such as the Oxford New Testament scholar Burnett Hillman Streeter (1932) who argued that the moral teaching of the Gautama Buddha has four remarkable resemblances to the Sermon on the Mount. The Jesus Conspiracy, 1997 The ideas of the two earlier books were developed and related to the Turin Shroud in Das Jesus-Komplott: die Wahrheit √ºber das Turiner GrabtuchDas Jesus-Komplott: die Wahrheit √ºber das Turiner Grabtuch. Heyne-Verlag, M√ºnchen 1997, . and Jesus starb nicht am Kreuz ‚Äî Die Botschaft des Turiner Grabtuchs (1998) The Jesus Conspiracy: The Turin Shroud and the Truth About the Resurrection.Jesus starb nicht am Kreuz ‚Äî Die Botschaft des Turiner Grabtuchs. Langen-M√ºller Verlag, M√ºnchen 1998, , (mit Elmar R. Gruber). The Jesus Conspiracy proposes that the Vatican interfered with the 1988 Radiocarbon 14 dating of the Shroud of Turin to show a medieval date for its origin. The authors propose that the shroud is authentic as the burial cloth of Jesus, but that evidence including blood tracks shows that Jesus was alive following his crucifixion. They argue that the Mandylion or Image of Edessa, known from the sixth century, was the Shroud, but folded to only show the face of Jesus. Because Jesus surviving the cross would contradict the teaching of the Resurrection, the central belief in Christianity, the authors allege that the Vatican used a piece from a 13th- century cloth with a similar herringbone weave to the Shroud of Turin as a substitute in the carbon dating. In part three, Elmar R. Gruber attempts to explain many details concerning what happened in \\"that dramatic hour of Good Friday\\". The book' repeats the author's earlier arguments that after the crucifixion Jesus moved to India. In a later book, they argued that he had become a Buddhist monk. Critical responses None of Kersten's works have found any support in mainstream scholarship ‚Äî either Biblical or Indologist. The noted German scholar of New Testament Apocrypha Wilhelm Schneemelcher, in a revision of his standard work prior to his death in 2003, and in unusually strong language for the scholarly community states that Kersten's work is based on \\"fantasy, untruth and ignorance (above all in the linguistic area)\\" and \\"has nothing to do with historical research.\\"New Testament Apocrypha, Vol. 1: Gospels and Related Writings by Wilhelm Schneemelcher and R. Mcl.

The brackish water stream, labeled on topographic maps as Dragon Swamp, is fed by underground springs, surface runoff, and numerous feeding swamps. In a study of 232 rivers and streams in the Chesapeake Bay, the Nature Conservancy and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation found the Dragon Run to rank second in terms of ecological significance. Efforts are being made to preserve the Dragon Run, including Governor Tim Kaine‚Äôs large purchase of land in order to maintain and protect the watershed‚Äôs original state. History The earliest record of the Dragon Run is by Captain John Smith in 1607. While on his way to meet with the Powhatan and Pocahontas, he crossed the stream and marked it on a map. Later, many settlers came from England to settle in Virginia. Some settled in the Dragon Run watershed, and descendants of those original settlers still own land there today. The first time the area was noted as ‚ÄúDragon Swamp‚Äù was in 1673 by cartographer Augustine Herman. It is believed that the Pamunkeys used the swamp as a hiding spot during Bacon's Rebellion. John Clayton (botanist) studied the area in 1773 and found over 800 species of native plant species and discovered 2 new species: Claytonia virginica and Osmunda claytoniana. The John Clayton Herbarium can still be found in London‚Äôs Natural History Museum, including plants from the Dragon Run. During the American Civil War, County Clerk P.T. Woodward reportedly prevented important Confederate documents from falling into Union hands by hiding them on an island in the Dragon Run. More recently, brothers James V. Morgan and Harvey B. Morgan have taken a stand in preserving the watershed by organizing the Friends of the Dragon Run. Morgan took the lead in preservation by buying some of the land and building canoe trails for people to explore. Geography Dragon Run Swamp is located in four counties in the Virginia Middle Peninsula encompassing a total of 140 square miles (90,000 acres). These counties are Essex, King & Queen, Middlesex, and Gloucester. The Dragon Run flows into the Piankatank River.

Near the source the Dragon Run there are chain pickerel, warmouth sunfish, bowfin, redbreast sunfish, and white catfish. The lower river is filled with migratory fish that only come into the area in the spring to spawn such as American shad, hickory shad, alewife herring, blueback herring, and striped bass. Other fish that reside in the lower section are channel catfish, white catfish, chain pickerel, largemouth bass, several varieties of sunfish, yellow perch, and white perch. The Dragon Run also houses rookeries for egrets and herons. The Dragon run is also abundant with flora. This masterpiece created by nature boasts violets (Viola sp.), turtlehead, mountain laurel, wild Iris (plant), cardinal flowers (Lobelia cardinalis), royal ferns (Osmunda spectabilis), pawpaw, shad bushes (Amelanchier sp.), wild plum, mistletoe, old man‚Äôs beard (Usnea sp.), bullhead lilies, pickerel weeds (Pontederia sp.), wild rice, duck potatoes (Sagittaria sp.), and cattails. The swamp is a heavily timbered area with pumpkin ash, gum, sycamore, river birch, red maple, dogwood, and huge bald cypress trees adorning every twist and turn the river takes. Preservation Many efforts have been put into place to preserve and protect the Dragon Run watershed. Under Governor Tim Kaine, Virginia and The Nature Conservancy purchased of the Dragon Run in order to conserve it and protect its wildlife. Friends of the Dragon Run are local citizens who donate money and time to help preserve the natural state of the swamp. They have purchased a tract of the swampland and work to manage the area and its natural environment. Friends of the Dragon Run encourage the use of no-till farming, filter strips, reforestation, contour plowing, and sensitive timbering techniques in and around the Dragon Run.

There are two types of incorporated municipalities in Maine, towns and cities. The tables below differentiate between towns and cities. Most areas of New England are entirely divided into incorporated municipalities, with no unincorporated territory. In the three northern New England states, however, some unincorporated territory does exist, generally in areas that are very sparsely populated. Maine contains significantly more unincorporated territory than the other states, with the bulk of it in interior and northern counties, including Hancock County. Some unincorporated territory in Maine is organized into a third type of town-level municipality unique to Maine, called a plantation (considered to be ‚Äúorganized‚Äù, but not incorporated), while some is entirely unorganized. Hancock County does not currently contain any plantations, but it has included plantations in the past. All of the unincorporated territory that currently exists within the county is unorganized. Due to the large extent of unincorporated territory in Hancock County, separate sections with detailed historical census totals for such areas follow the main tables below. For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality, including any plantations and unorganized entities, should yield the county total.

Plantations As of 1900, Hancock County appears to have contained five plantations. Much of present-day Hancock County was originally laid out as numbered townships, and four of the plantations had simply kept their numbers when they organized as plantations. These were Plantation No. 7, Plantation No. 8, Plantation No. 21, and Plantation No. 33. The fourth plantation, Long Island, was named for the offshore island on which it was located. There is some question as to Plantation No. 7‚Äôs status; the 1900 and 1910 Census reported it as a plantation, but the author of this article has been unable to find confirmation of this in any other source. Plantation No. 8 surrendered its organization in 1913. According to the 1920 census reports, Plantation No. 7 also surrendered its organization some time between 1910 and 1920. The three other plantations have all since incorporated as towns. Their dispositions are as follows: *Plantation No. 21: changed its name to Osborn in 1923; incorporated as a town in 1976 *Long Island: changed name to Frenchboro and incorporated as a town in 1979 *Plantation No. 33: apparently changed its name to Great Pond some time between 1970 and 1980 (shown as Great Pond Plantation in the 1980 Census); incorporated as a town in 1981 With Great Pond‚Äôs incorporation as a town, there are no longer any active plantations in Hancock County. 1900 *Long Island 174 *No. 33 82 *No. 21 58 *No. 7 28 *No. 8 17 1910 *Long Island 197 *No. 33 54 *No. 21 39 *No. 8 19 *No. 7 14 1920 *Long Island 164 *No. 33 49 *No. 21 41 1930 *Long Island 145 *No. 33 45 *Osborn 34 1940 *Long Island 119 *No. 33 76 *Osborn 40 1950 *Long Island 97 *Osborn 49 *No. 33 37 1960 *No. 33 58 *Long Island 57 *Osborn 36 1970 *Long Island 56 *No. 33 43 *Osborn 33 1980 *Great Pond 45 There have been no plantations in Hancock County at any time since the 1980s. Unorganized Territory Like all of Maine's interior and northern counties, Hancock County contains a significant amount of unorganized territory. Most of the unorganized territory in Hancock County is in areas which have historically been very sparsely populated. The coastal and southwestern areas of the county have historically been fully incorporated. Further inland to the northeast, lower-lying areas with access to lakes and rivers have generally been incorporated or organized, while more mountainous or remote areas have often never had any significant population and have remained unorganized. The northeastern part of the county is largely unorganized, as is the area along the eastern edge bordering Washington County. Along the eastern edge of the county, the unorganized territory actually comes quite close to the coast (the coastal town of Gouldsboro borders an unorganized township on its northern side). There is also an unorganized tract called Township No. 8 (also known as T8 SD) located in an otherwise fully incorporated area, bounded by Ellsworth, Hancock, Franklin, Waltham and Mariaville. This is a remnant, measuring about , of what was once a larger survey township. Historically, about two-thirds of the county‚Äôs land area was incorporated or organized, leaving the remaining one-third unorganized. There are at least a dozen full-sized townships in the county which have never been organized, along with the remnants of a few additional townships whose territories were partially taken to form incorporated towns. The general divider between the organized and unorganized portions of the county historically followed the northern or interior boundaries of Amherst, Great Pond, Aurora, Osborn, Eastbrook, Franklin, Sullivan and Gouldsboro. With the exception of Township No. 8, all territory to the south or west of that line was historically organized, although several municipalities did not advance beyond the plantation stage until the 1970s or later, if at all. North or to the interior of that line, all territory is, and has historically been, unorganized. The areas of Hancock County that are entirely unorganized cover about , with a population of about 200. This covers about 30% of the county‚Äôs land area, but includes less than 1% of its population. Two unorganized townships, T3 ND and T8 SD, have large enough populations to maintain a registrar and clerk to conduct elections for state and federal offices, although they do not have true organized municipal governments (No. 3 is in the northeastern part of the county, adjacent to the Penobscot County town of Burlington; No. 8 is described in the first paragraph of this section). A similar entity has also been formed by a group of two unorganized townships banding together: the ‚ÄúUnorganized Township of DTT9 & T10‚Äù (T9 SD and T10 SD are in the southeastern part of the county, east of Franklin and northeast of Sullivan; T9, the westernmost of the two, is a remnant of what was once a larger survey township). Over the years, the U.S. Census Bureau has used different methods to compile data for unorganized territory in Maine. From 1900 to 1950, data was tabulated for each individual unorganized entity. In 1960, a single catch-all ‚ÄúUnorganized Territory‚Äù listing was provided for each Maine county, generally with no further breakdown. Since 1970, the Census has grouped contiguous areas in each county into one or more ‚Äúunorganized territories‚Äù. As of the 2000 Census, three such areas are recognized within Hancock County: *East Hancock Unorganized Territory: the unorganized area to the north or east of Amherst, Great Pond, Aurora, Osborn, Eastbrook, Franklin, Sullivan and Gouldsboro. This covers the bulk of the historically unorganized territory in Penobscot County. *Central Hancock Unorganized Territory: T8 SD, an unorganized tract measuring about , bounded by Ellsworth, Hancock, Franklin, Waltham and Mariaville. This is a remnant of what was once a larger survey township. This township constitutes an Unorganized Territory in its entirety because it does not border any other land that is unorganized. *Northwest Hancock Unorganized Territory: T32 MD. This township constitutes an Unorganized Territory in its entirety because it does not border any other land that is both unorganized and within Hancock County. The roster of Unorganized Territories in Hancock County has not changed since Unorganized Territories were first created for the 1970 Census. The listings below provide population figures for 1) all unincorporated territory, including plantations; 2) organized plantations, for which breakouts are available in the main tables above; and 3) unorganized territory, with any available breakouts provided. 1900 All unincorporated territory 516 Organized plantations 359 Unorganized territory 157 *T39 MD 75 *T10 SD 19 *T32 MD 12 *T28 MD 10 *T22 MD 3 *Islands: 38 (see ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù section below) 1910 All unincorporated territory 435 Organized plantations 323 Unorganized territory 112 *T28 MD 17 *T32 MD 17 *T10 SD 13 *T9 SD 1 *Islands: 64 (see ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù section below) 1920 All unincorporated territory 328 Organized plantations 254 Unorganized territory 74 *T8 SD 21 *T7 SD 19 *T32 MD 18 *T10 SD 16 1930 All unincorporated territory 274 Organized plantations 224 Unorganized territory 50 *T7SD 19 *T32 MD 14 *T10 SD 9 *T8 SD 8 1940 All unincorporated territory 366 Organized plantations 235 Unorganized territory 131 *T8 SD 35 *T16 MD 13 *T10 SD 11 *T3 ND 8 *T28 MD 7 *T7 SD 5 *T22 MD 2 *T32 MD 2 *T4 ND 1 *T9 ND 1 *T34 MD 1 *Islands: 45 (see ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù section below) 1950 All unincorporated territory 287 Organized plantations 183 Unorganized territory 104 *T8 SD 75 *T7 SD 9 *T10 SD 6 *T9 SD 5 *Islands: 9 (see ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù section below) 1960 All unincorporated territory 292 Organized plantations 151 Unorganized territory 141 The 1960 Census reported all unorganized territory in Hancock County under a single catch-all listing.

This area was originally part of Bingham's Penobscot Purchase. Most of the remaining unorganized townships in Hancock County are in the MD or SD sequences. Numbering in MD and SD is continuous, working row-by-row south to north, then west to east within each row. For example, T7 SD is near the coast; T22 MD is directly north, some distance inland; T34 is further directly north, further inland. There are also two ND townships in Hancock County, in the northeast corner of the county. Although the two ND unorganized townships have numbers that are not duplicated by any existing MD or SD unorganized townships, the ND numbering sequence is unrelated to the MD and SD numbering sequence (T3 ND and T4 ND are immediately to the north of T40 MD and T41 MD). Most of the unorganized townships in Hancock are identified only by their survey numbers and have never developed informal township names. In 2005, the Maine state legislature officially named T8 SD, which had not previously had a generally used name, as Fletchers Landing Township. Notes Unorganized Islands Several of the censuses between 1900 and 1950 contain listings for offshore islands in Hancock County which appear to have been unorganized territory, but were treated as distinct from any larger unorganized entity. These listings are as follows: *1900: Eagle Island (pop. 30) and Butter Island (pop. 8). *1910: Eagle Island (pop. 31), Marshalls Island (pop. 14), Mount Desert Rock Island (pop. 10), Hog Island (pop. 3), Bear Island (pop. 2), Butter Island (pop. 2), and Pumpkin Island (pop. 2). A footnote describes these areas as ‚Äúnot within the limits of an organized town or plantation‚Äù. *1920: according to a footnote, Bear, Butter, Eagle, Hog and Pumpkin islands are returned with the town of Deer Isle; Mount Desert Rock is returned with Long Island Plantation; and Marshalls Island is returned with the town of Swans Island. *1930: a footnote mentions that the above islands were returned independently in 1910, but contains no specific information about their disposition. *1940: ‚ÄúIslands not belonging to any town‚Äù (pop. 45). The specific islands are not identified, and no explanation is provided as to how these islands had been handled in 1930. *1950: ‚ÄúIslands not belonging to any town‚Äù (pop. 9). In the 1960 Census, all unorganized territory in Hancock County was included in a single catch-all listing. 1950 and 1940 figures are provided as well, calculated by adding together the unorganized territory originally reported in those two censuses. The 1950 and 1940 totals for unorganized territory include the ‚ÄúIslands not belonging to any town‚Äù totals shown above. It is not clear how those islands have been accounted for in 1960 and subsequent censuses. Modern sources show no such unorganized territory in Hancock County today, so at some point they were apparently either annexed to nearby towns, or a decision was made to treat them as part of those towns for Census purposes.

Originally they were founded in 1962 but they were in an amateur level. They competed in the Maltese Third Division in 1994 for the first time. Pembroke Athleta reached the Premier League for the first time in 2015. History *1962: Founded as Athleta Juvenis *1994: Debuted in Maltese Third Division and renamed Pembroke Athleta F.C *1996: Maltese Third Division (Section B) Winners *1998: Maltese Third and Second Division Knock-Out Runners Up *2012: Maltese Third Division Champions *2014: Maltese Second Division Runners Up *2015: Maltese First Division Champions 2011‚Äì12 Season A game of note for the club was when Pembroke were drawn against giants Hibernians in the Maltese FA Trophy. Pembroke went into half time with a shock score of 2‚Äì2 courtesy of goals from Matthew Borg and Lydon Cilia but during the second half, the endless attacks from Hibernians proved too much and despite some very good saves from Pembroke goalkeeper Rodrick Debattista and a perfectly executed goal from Pembroke Captain Carlo Leonardi, Pembroke eventually succumbed to Hibs and the game ended with the score at 5‚Äì3. During the same season, Pembroke managed to clinch first place in the Maltese Third Division and promotion to the Maltese Second Division. They finished in 1st place after managing to take 63 points from 26 games. 2012‚Äì13 Season Still led by Jacques Scerri, Pembroke prepared for their first season in the Maltese Second Division. John Roland Emeka was the club's marquee signing, with the Nigerian striker arriving from recently relegated Senglea Athletic. Other signings included Matthew Mulholland, Jonathan Vella, Michael Ellul, Kane Micallef and Nicholas Grima. Pembroke started the season in incredible form, remaining unbeaten for the first 7 games, even topping the table at one point. Things went a bit sour as the season reached December though and 3 consecutive losses without scoring cost the club. In the end the team finished in 7th place, a solid mid-table position having won 12, drew 7 and lost 9 of their 26 games. Throughout the season, the Greys scored a total of 42 goals and conceded 30, the best defensive record out of all the sides that did not clinch promotion. John Roland Emeka proved his worth by ending the season as the club's top scorer with 14 goals. In the Maltese FA Trophy, Pembroke once again managed to make their way into the Third Round, beating Gozitan side Xewkija Tigers 3‚Äì2. In the Third Round, they were drawn against Premier League club Qormi FC. Qormi in the end triumphed with a score of 5‚Äì2 which was obtained in extra time. Like the previous year Pembroke had made a Premier League team (who would end the tournament as runners-up) struggle. In the U-19 section of the club, the Youth team made history as they obtained the club's first ever promotion to Section B after finishing 1st with 34 points from 18 games. 2013‚Äì14 Season Following the departure of Jacques Scerri to Melita F.C., Vojko Martinovic, who had successfully led the club's U-17 section to promotion to the top division (Section A), was installed as the new manager of the team. New signings for the team included Nicholas Zammit, Mauro Grioli, Mark Borg, Adrian Caruana, David Mamo, Aleksandar Ribic, Lee Grima, Roberto Vella, Dylan Mintoff and Michael Borg. Carmelo Farrugia also returned from Qormi F.C. to spend another season on loan at the club. The season began in impressive fashion as we remained unbeaten up until December, when we lost 1‚Äì0 to Marsaskala F.C.. Nonetheless, we powered on and eventually finished in 2nd place in the 2nd Division behind Mqabba, therefore gaining a historic promotion to the Maltese 1st Division for the first time in the club's history. Nicholas Zammit finished the season as the club's top scorer with 13 goals. The Youths Team was even more successful through the season as it managed an incredible promotion to the top of the Youth pyramid. This mean that within four seasons, the U-19 Team had won its way from Section D all the way to Section A. Even more incredibly, the team managed to dispatch some of the best youth teams on the island including Hibernians F.C., Mosta F.C., Hamruns Spartans F.C. and Sliema Wanderers to win the Youth Knock-Out Competition. The 1‚Äì0 victory against Sliema in the final made the team the first ever in the club's history to win the Trophy and also the first ever Section B team to triumph in this competition. 2014‚Äì15 Season The new season saw the return of an old face, as Jacques Scerri returned to the club with Greg Degabriele, Kenneth Portelli and later on in the season, Mario Muscat as part of the technical staff. With the new staff came a host of new players namely Roderick Bajada, Ayrton Azzopardi, Ariel Laudisi, Andrea Cassar, Ousmane Sidibe, Carlo Mamo, Lucky Omerou and Abubaker Bello Osagie among others who joined long term club players such as Geoffrey Spiteri and Matthew Calleja Cremona.

It is used extensively in architecture when calculating the arc necessary to span a certain height and distance and also in optics where it is used to find the depth of a spherical mirror or lens. The name comes directly from Latin sagitta, meaning an arrow. Formulae In the following equations, denotes the sagitta (the depth or height of the arc), equals the radius of the circle, and the length of the chord spanning the base of the arc. As and are two sides of a right triangle with as the hypotenuse, the Pythagorean theorem gives us : r^2 = (\\\\ell/2)^2 + (r-s)^2. This may be rearranged to give any of the other three: : s = r - \\\\sqrt{r^2 - {(\\\\ell/2)^2}}, : \\\\ell = 2\\\\sqrt{2rs - s^2}, or : r = \\\\frac{s^2 + (\\\\ell/2)^2}{2s} = \\\\frac{s}{2}+\\\\frac{\\\\ell^2}{8s}. The sagitta may also be calculated from the versine function, for an arc that spans an angle of , and coincides with the versine for unit circles : s = r \\\\operatorname{versin}\\\\theta = r\\\\left(1-\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\right) = 2r\\\\sin^2\\\\frac\\\\theta 2. Approximation When the sagitta is small in comparison to the radius, it may be approximated by the formula :s\\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\ell^2}{8r}. Alternatively, if the sagitta is small and the sagitta, radius, and chord length are known, they may be used to estimate the arc length by the formula :a\\\\approx\\\\ell+\\\\frac{2 s^2}{r}, where is the length of the arc; this formula was known to the Chinese mathematician Shen Kuo, and a more accurate formula also involving the sagitta was developed two centuries later by Guo Shoujing. Applications Architects, engineers, and contractors use these equations to create \\"flattened\\" arcs that are used in curved walls, arched ceilings, bridges, and numerous other applications. The sagitta also has uses in physics where it is used, along with chord length, to calculate the radius of curvature of an accelerated particle. This is used especially in bubble chamber experiments where it is used to determine the momenta of decay particles.

His dam, Saracen, was a daughter of Federico Tesio's outstanding Italian runner, Donatello. The horse was by Robert C. Boucher, a fruit farmer from Kent , and trained by George Colling. Racing career He raced at age three with his best conditions race result a third in the Knights Royal Stakes. In October 1952, assistant trainer John Waugh brought the four-year-old Wilwyn to the United States where he won his eleventh straight race by capturing the inaugural running of the Washington, D.C. International Stakes at the Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland. An outstanding race in which the lead changed hands six times, the success of the Washington, D.C. International Stakes would help spawn the Breeders' Cup. The November 27, 1952 edition of the New York Times reported that an American syndicate was negotiating with owner Robert Boucher to buy Wilwyn. Boucher rejected an offer of US$100,000 and the deal did not go through. After winning the October 27, 1953 Limekiln Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse, Wilwyn was sent back to the United States for the second edition of the Washington, D.C. International Stakes.

He was the son of the roccoco engraver Gabriel Huquier and his wife Marie-Ann (Desvignes). One of Huquier's subjects was Chevalier d'Eon, an early transvestite. Life Huquier was born in Paris in 1725. His father was an engraver in the style of Watteau and Boucher. His father's work based on the style of J. A. Meissonnier and Oppenord helped set styles in Louis XV's reign with regard to furniture, silver, and other decorative ornament. James Huquier assisted his father in many of his engravings. He married Anne Louise, the daughter of the engraver Jacques Ch√©reau, in 1758 in Paris. He collaborated as an engraver and printseller with his father-in-law. They created a shop that sold wallpapers and prints in 1764 and two years later they had a wallpaper factory. The business appears to have struggled, however, and after making a number of excursions, Huquier left his family behind and moved to England. Mr and Mrs Hall of Bristol Huquier emigrated to England with his father. He exhibited some pastels at the Royal Academy and was also represented at the Society of Artists. Huquier also completed a number of pastel portraits which sold well. He had a self-portrait in the Royal Academy in 1771 and in 1785. The pastels illustrated are on paper and are of Mr Hall, a Bristol-based glass manufacturer, and his wife. One of Huquier's more remarkable subjects was Chevalier d'Eon, a French spy who served as an ambassador in London. Chevalier d'Eon was notably transvestite and an early transgender person . The Chevalier spent the end of her life living as a woman. In 1783, Huquier lived in Cambridge but later retired to Shrewsbury. As Huquier's wife Anne Louise had already died, he may have thought to benefit when his father-in-law and collaborator died. In the event, however, his three daughters Julie-Marie, Rosalie, and Anne-Genevi√®ve were left shares, and were made wards of their cousin, Jacques-Francois Ch√©reau. Huquier died on 7 June 1805.

Its territory is located on several of the Sorel Islands in the Saint Lawrence River where it flows into Lac Saint-Pierre. The largest of these islands is Dupas Island (√éle Dupas), also known as Isle du Pads (or Isle du Pas), √éle d'Angoul√®me, and √éle du Richelieu at various times in the past. The area is known for its geese, ducks, and muskrats, and it is suitable for farming, hunting and fishing. History The islands were already well known by the indigenous people as a good fishing and hunting location, and they used them to counter repeated attacks by the French. The first Frenchman settling on the largest island was reputedly Pierre Dupas (1637-1677), officier in the Carignan Regiment who arrived in Canada in 1665. Together with two servants, he settled in 1669 on the island which came to bear his name, and he became the first Lord of the l'√éle-Dupas-et-du-Chicot Seignory in 1672. In 1677, his widow sold the seignory to Charles Aubert de La Chesnaye. On November 11, 1690, Louis Dandonneau-dit-Lajeunesse, Sieur de Sable, and his brother-in-law Jacques Brisset, both from Champlain, Quebec, purchased the island from Aubert. The following decade saw permanent settlement begin on the island. From 1712 to 1727, explorer Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La V√©rendrye, lived on the island and his five children were born there. In 1834, the Parish of L'Isle-du-Pads was founded, followed by the civil parish in 1842. In 1845, the Municipality of L'Isle-du-Pads was established, but abolished in 1847, when it became part of the Berthier County Municipality. In 1855, it was reestablished as a parish municipality called La Visitation-de- la-Sainte-Vierge-de-l'Isle-du-Pads, one of the longest place names in Quebec history. In 1865, the area experienced a flood which killed 15 people and washed away 27 houses. By the end of the 19th century, more than 1,000 people lived on the island, and in the early 20th century, almost the entire island was used for growing hay, which was exported to the United States in large quantities. In 1897, the municipality lost about half of its territory when the new Parish Municipality of Saint-Ignace-de-Loyola was formed. In 1981, the parish municipality abbreviated its name and changed its status to become the Municipality of La Visitation-de-l'√éle-Dupas.

It is being developed and maintained by the Crown Human Genome Center at the Weizmann Institute of Science. The database aims at providing a quick overview of the current available biomedical information about the searched gene, including the human genes, the encoded proteins, and the relevant diseases. The GeneCards database provides access to free Web resources about more than 7000 all known human genes that integrated from >90 data resources, such as HGNC, Ensembl, and NCBI. The core gene list is based on approved gene symbols published by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC). The information is carefully gathered and selected from these databases by its engine. If the search does not return any results, this database will give several suggestions to help users accomplish their search depending on the type of query and offer direct links to other databases‚Äô search engine. Over time, the GeneCards database has developed a suite of tools (GeneDecks, GeneLoc, GeneALaCart) that has more specialised capability. Since 1998, the GeneCards database has been widely used by bioinformatics, genomics and medical communities for more than 15 years.  History  Since the 1980s, sequence information has become increasingly abundant; subsequently many laboratories realized this and began to store such information in central repositories-the primary database. However, the information provided by the primary sequence databases (lower level databases) focus on different aspects. To gather these scattered data, the Weizmann Institute of Science's Crown Human Genome Centre developed a database called ‚ÄòGeneCards‚Äô in 1997. This database mainly dealt with human genome information, human genes, the encoded proteins‚Äô functions, and related diseases, though it has expanded since that time.  Growth  Initially, the GeneCards database had two main features: delivery of integrated biomedical information for a gene in ‚Äòcard‚Äô format, and a text-based search engine. Since 1998, the database has integrated more data resources and data types, such as protein expression and gene network information. It has also improved the speed and sophistication of the search engine, and expanded from a gene-centric dogma to contain gene-set analyses. Version 3 of the database gathers information from more than 90 database resources based on a consolidated gene list. It has also added a suite of GeneCards tools which focus on more specific purposes. \\"GeneNote and GeneAnnot for transcriptome analyses, GeneLoc for genomic locations and markers, GeneALaCart for batch queries and GeneDecks for finding functional partners and for gene set distillations.\\". The database updates on a 3-year cycle of planning, implementation, development, semi-automated quality assurance, and deployment. Technologies used include Eclipse, Apache, Perl, XML, PHP, Propel, Java, R and MySQL.  Ongoing GeneCards Expansions  *Animal models *Tissue proteomics profiling *RNA genes *Gene and protein identifier mapping *Online analytical processing (OLAP)  Availability  GeneCards can be freely accessed by non-profit institution for educational and research purpose at https://www.genecards.org/ and academic mirror sites. Commercial usage requires a license.  GeneCards Suite  GeneDecks GeneDecks is a novel analysis tool to identify similar or partner genes, which provides a similarity metric by highlighting shared descriptors between genes, based on GeneCards‚Äô unique wealth of combinatorial annotations of human genes. # Annotation combinatory: Using GeneDecks, one can get a set of similar genes for a particular gene with a selected combinatorial annotation. The summary table result in ranking the different level of similarity between the identified genes and the probe gene. # Annotation unification: Different data sources often offer annotations with heterogeneous naming system. Annotation unification of GeneDecks is based on the similarity in GeneCards gene-content space detection algorithms. # Partner hunting: In GeneDecks's Partner Hunter, users give a query gene, and the system seeks similar genes based on combinatorial similarity of weighted attributes. # Set distillation: In Set distiller, users give a set of genes, and the system ranks attributes by their degree of sharing within a given gene set. Like Partner Hunter, it enables sophisticated investigation of a variety of gene sets, of diverse origins, for discovering and elucidating relevant biological patterns, thus enhancing systematic genomics and systems biology scrutiny. GeneALaCart GeneALaCart is a gene-set-orientated batch-querying engine based on the popular GeneCards database. It allows retrieval of information about multiple genes in a batch query. GeneLoc The GeneLoc suit member presents an integrated human chromosome map, which is very important for designing a custom-made capture chip, based on data integrated by the GeneLoc algorithm.

For example, S.H. Shah extracted data of early-onset coronary artery disease from GeneCards to identify genes that contributes to the disease. Chromosome 3q13, 1q25 etc. are confirmed to take effects and this paper further discussed the relationship between morbid genes and serum lipoproteins with the help of GeneCard. Another example is a research study on synthetic lethality in cancer. Synthetic lethality appears when a mutation in a single gene has no effect on the function of a cell but a mutation in an additional gene leads to cell death. This study aimed to find novel methods of treating cancer through blocking the lethality of drugs. GeneCards was used when comparing data of a given target gene with all possible genes. In this process, the annotation sharing score was calculated using GeneDecks Partner Hunter (now called Genes Like Me) to give paralogy. Inactivation targets were be extracted after the microarray experiments of resistant and non-resistant neuroblastoma cell lines.

Formed in 1966, the association ran a league until 1973, adhering strictly to the Laws of the Game, the FIFA rulebook being one of the few books in the prison library. It was named after the 19th century Xhosa warrior- prophet Makana, who was himself imprisoned on Robben Island. Prior to this, the game had been banned by the prison authorities, but starting in December 1964, prisoners took it turns to \\"...request to be allowed to play football\\" every Saturday. At one point the F.A. was running three leagues, with teams from nine clubs competing. The organisation crossed the political divides in the prison, between the ANC and the PAC, with over half of the inmates involved in the leagues. A small group of prisoners, including Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki and Ahmed Kathrada were, however, barred from participating in or even watching the matches. The Makana F.A. was given honorary membership of FIFA in 2007, and in the same year a film was made telling the story of the F.A., entitled More Than Just a Game.

On his second trip in 1805 he was appointed Assistant Surgeon in the Bengal service of the HEIC and placed in medical charge of the station of Backergunj near Dacca in present- day Bangladesh. It was whilst at Backergunj that he began his study of Persian and other oriental languages. He became a close friend of Sir Charles D‚ÄôOyly who was the Collector of Dacca (1808‚Äì1812) and a keen amateur artist. George Chinnery stayed with D‚ÄôOyly during this period and both D‚ÄôOyly and Atkinson became his pupils becoming heavily influenced by his passion for painting Indian landscapes and village life.pp 149 and 224 The Raj, India and the British 1600-1947, various contributors edited by C.

Bayly, Published by the National Portrait Gallery Publications 1990  Calcutta  Suttee by James Atkinson 1831, digital image (c) British Library Board 2009 (F165) It was Atkinson's proficiency with languages that brought him to the attention of The Lord Minto, the Governor General of India, who invited Atkinson to Calcutta in 1812 where he was appointed Assistant to the Assay Master at the Calcutta Mint (appointed Deputy Assay Master in 1818). The Assay Master was Horace Hayman Wilson,http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?search=sp&sText;=james+atkinson&page;=1&rNo;=1 orientalist and Secretary to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, who published the first Sanskrit to English dictionary in 1819. For most of 1820 while Wilson was setting up the new Mint at Benares Atkinson worked alongside James Prinsep, the antiquarian and numismatist, at the Calcutta Mint.p. iii Essays on Indian Antiquities, Historic, Numismatic, and Palaeographic, of the Late James Prinsep, FRS, Edward Thomas (ed.), published by John Murray 1858 The appointment at the Mint while not a sinecure as such afforded Atkinson a considerable amount of free time to pursue more academic pursuits. He published a ‚Äòfree‚Äô translation of the poem Soohrab an extract from the Sha Nameh by the Persian poet Firdausi in 1814; Hatim Ta‚Äôee, an old romance in the Persian language in 1818 for the use of the students at Fort William College where he held the Deputy Chair of Persian for that year; in 1819 The Aubid an eastern tale and in 1824 The City of Palaces, a collection of poems, the title of which became the epithet for Calcutta during the period of British rule.p.7 Calcutta, city of palaces: a survey of the city in the days of the East India Company, 1690-1858, J. P. Losty published by the British Library 1990 Atkinson was a member of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta and sat on the committee of the Chowringhee Theatre.  Government Gazette  Atkinson was also Editor of the Calcutta Gazette, one of the earliest English language newspapers in India being founded in 1784. It was a weekly newspaper which had the exclusive rights of publishing Government announcements and advertisements affording it an increased circulation and the potential of increased advertising revenues from other sources. In 1815 the Government transferred these rights to the Bengal Military Orphan Society in order to provide an income for the charity as well as providing the orphans with a potential trade. The new paper was named the Government Gazette and was thenceforth printed from the Orphan Society‚Äôs Press. Atkinson became the Editor of the new Government Gazette in 1815 and in 1817 the Superintendent of the Press. Under Atkinson the Government Gazette continued to be a great success publishing two issues per week from 1823 and in 1827 it was the most widely circulated of all the English language newspapers in Bengal.pp 43-44 History of English Press in Bengal 1780 to 1857, Mrinal Kanti Chanda, Published by KP Bagchi & Company, 1987 The Government Gazette included local and national news including extracts from English newspapers and those of Bombay and Madras, letters from correspondents, information on the customs and manners of the people of India as well as occasionally translations of Sanskrit hymns and Persian poetry.p. 115 A History of the Calcutta Press , P Thankappan Nair, Published by Firma KLM Pvt Ltd 1987 For the years 1825-1828 Atkinson leased the Press and the Government Gazette from the Orphan Society for an annual fee of 40,000 rupees effectively becoming its proprietor to run as his own business.  Epic of Kings  Laili and Majnun In 1829 Atkinson left India after a disagreement with the newly arrived Governor General Lord Bentinckhttp://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?search=sp&sText;=james+atkinson&page;=1&rNo;=4 concerning Atkinson‚Äôs role at the Government Gazette and he spent the next five years in England. It was at this time he took the opportunity to translate an abridged version of the Sha Nameh of the Persian poet Firdausi in prose and verse published in 1832 which won the gold medal of the Oriental Translation Fund. In the same year he published Customs and Manners of the Women of Persia, and their domestic superstitions, translated from the original Persian manuscript (Kit√°bi Kuls√∫m Naneh). In 1833 he returned to India resuming his former profession of Surgeon with the HEIC, during which time he had published a translation of Nizami Ganjavi‚Äôs Laili and Majnun and Makhzan ul Asrar, the Treasury of Secrets by the Oriental Translation Fund in 1836.  Afghanistan In 1838 he was appointed Superintending Surgeon of the Army of the Indus, Bengal Division. He proceeded with the Army under Sir John Keane on its ill-fated expedition into Afghanistan to replace the unpopular and weak, but pro-British, Shah Shoojah-ool-Moolk on the throne and oust Dost Mohamed Khan who had been making political overtures to the Russians. Atkinson was present at the storming of Ghuznee in July 1839 and the eventual capture of Kabul shortly after in the First Afghan War; for his part he was awarded the Order of the Dooranee Empire (3rd class). Atkinson was recalled to India in December 1840 to take up his post as Superintending Surgeon of the Cawnpore Division and thus avoided the fate of the remaining British garrison which was destroyed whilst attempting to withdraw to Jellalabad in the winter of 1841.Bolan from Atkinson's Sketches in Afghaunistan Atkinson published his journals of his involvement in the campaign in 1842 in The Expedition into Affghanistan, including a background to the conflict, his own journey across northern India to join the Army and his return, the hardship endured by the Army and its followers through the harsh terrain of Afghanistan beset by Beloochee tribesmen and also of the time he spent in Kabul. He writes of the history of the land, its buildings and people, having met and painted many of the protagonists in the campaign, including both Shah Shoojah-ool-Moolk and Dost Mohammad Khan. He realised the impossibility of controlling a country like Afghanistan in his line ‚ÄúLike Sisyphus, we have rolled up the huge stone to the top of the mountain, and if we do not keep it there, our labour will be lost‚Äù.Preface vii, The Expedition into Affghanistan, James Atkinson, Published by W H Allen & Co 1842 The same year Atkinson published Sketches in Afghaunistan, a folio of 25 tinted lithographed plates showing the topography and landscapes of Afghanistan and the Punjab creating an important record of ‚Äúwhat was then an unexplored country\\". Atkinson had planned a second volume but the 'worked up' paintings were lost at sea en route to his British publisher where they were to be engraved; the original sketches he had prepared on the spot however are in the British Library.  Retirement  Atkinson became a member of the Medical Board in Calcutta in 1845 and was made Inspector General of Hospitals, he retired two years later after 45 years in the Company‚Äôs service and returned to England. He died on 7 August 1852 and was interred at Brompton Cemetery, London.  Marriage  Atkinson married Jane Bathie on 4 October 1815 at Fort William, Calcutta. Together they had four sons and one daughter: Frederick Dayot, Charles D‚ÄôOyly, George Francklin, Julia and James Augustus.

Biography Dost Muhammad was born and received his early education in Kandahar in Afghanistan. While still a young man he encountered the great Indian Naqshbandi master Ghulam Ali Dehlavi (1743‚Äì1824) in the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. He reported that Ghulam Ali's spiritual energy (fayz) was so strong that it caused him to become restless and disturbed, to the extent that he was hardly able to move from his place. Returning to India, he continued to be subject to ecstatic states, some of which lasted for several weeks. Ghulam Ali died, however, before Dost Muhammad could become a disciple. So instead he applied to Ghulam Ali's successor Abu Sa'eed Mujaddidi Rampuri. At the time Abu Sa'eed was leaving for the Hajj and sent Dost Muhammad to his son (and successor) Shah Ahmed Sa'eed Dehlvi (1802‚Äì1860). Within 14 months of staying with his Shaykh, Haji Dost Muhammad became Ahmed Sa'eed's khalifa in the Qandahar region of Afghanistan. Following the assassination in 1842 of Shah Shuja, the ruler of Afghanistan (and client of the British), Dost Muhammad was forced to leave the country. (These same events also forced the departure from Afghanistan of his most celebrated disciple, Sayyid Muhammed Shah Jan-Fishan Khan Paghmani). Ahmed Sa'eed advised Dost Muhammad to establish himself in a place where \\"both Pashto and Punjabi are spoken\\". Following this instruction, Dost Muhammad settled in the village of Musazai Sharif, near to Dera Ismail Khan (now in Pakistan), where he established a teaching centre and is buried. Death and Successor Dost Muhammad's successor was Khwaja Muhammad Usman Damani, to whom he gave unrestricted permission to teach \\"the methods of the Naqshbandiyya Mujaddidiya Ma'sumiyya Mazhariyya and the Qadiriyya, Chistiyya, Suhrawardiyya, Kubrawiyya, Shattariyya, Madariyya, Qalandariyya and other Sufi lineages\\". He also handed over to him all his Islamic centers including Musazai Sharif, his personal library and other assets. Haji Dost Muhammad died on 22 Shawwal 1284 AH (17 February 1868) and was buried in Mussa Zai Sharif, district Dera Ismail Khan in present-day Pakistan. In The Way of the Sufi, Idries Shah attributes this \\"sentence of the Khajagan\\" to Dost Muhammad (who he calls Qandahari): \\"You hear my words. Hear, too, that there are words other than mine. These are not meant for hearing with the physical ear. Because you see only me, you think there is no Sufism apart from me. You are here to learn, not to collect historical information.\\" Spiritual chain of succession Haji Dost Muhammad Qandhari belonged to the Mujaddidi order of Sufism, which is the main branch of Naqshbandi Sufi tariqah. His spiritual lineage goes to Muhammad, through Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, the Mujaddid of eleventh Hijri century. The complete lineage is as under: # Sayyadna Muhammad (died 11 AH, buried Madinah SA (570/571 - 632 CE)) # Sayyadna Abu Bakr Siddiq, (d. 13 AH, buried Madinah, SA) # Sayyadna Salman al-Farsi, (d. 35 AH, buried Madaa'in, SA) # Imam Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr (d. 107 AH, buried Madinah, SA) # Imam Jafar Sadiq, (after which moved to Iran; d. 148 AH buried Madinah, SA) # Shaikh Bayazid Bastami, (d. 261 AH, buried Bistaam, Iraq (804 - 874 CE)) # Shaikh Abul Hassan Kharqani, (d. 425 AH buried, Kharqaan, Iran) # Shaikh Abul Qasim Gurgani, (d. 450 AH, buried Gurgan, Iran) # Shaikh Abu Ali Farmadi, (after which he moved to Turkmenistan; d. 477 AH, buried Tous, Khorasan, Iran) # Khwaja Abu Yaqub Yusuf Hamadani, (d. 535 AH, buried Maru, Khorosan, Iran) # Khwaja Abdul Khaliq Ghujdawani, (d. 575 AH, buried Ghajdawan, Bukhara, Uzbekistan) # Khwaja Arif Reogari, (d. 616 AH, buried Reogar, Bukhara, Uzbekistan) # Khwaja Mahmood Anjir-Faghnawi, (d. 715 AH, buried Waabakni, Mawralnahar) # Shaikh Azizan Ali Ramitani, (d. 715 AH, buried Khwaarizm, Bukhara, Uzbekistan) # Shaikh Muhammad Baba Samasi, (d. 755 AH, buried Samaas, Bukhara, Uzbekistan) # Shaikh Sayyid Amir Kulal, (d. 772 AH, buried Saukhaar, Bukhara, Uzbekistan) # Shaikh Muhammad Baha'uddin Naqshband, (d. 791 AH, buried Qasr-e-Aarifan, Bukhara, Uzbekistan (1318‚Äì1389 CE)) # Shaikh Ala'uddin Attar Bukhari, (buried Jafaaniyan, Mawranahar, Uzbekistan) # Shaikh Yaqub Charkhi, (d. 851 AH, buried Charkh, Bukhara, Uzbekistan) # Shaikh Ubaidullah Ahrar, (d. 895 AH, buried Samarkand, Uzbekistan) # Shaikh Muhammad Zahid Wakhshi, (d. 936 AH, buried Wakhsh, Malk Hasaar) # Shaikh Durwesh Muhammad, (d. 970 AH, buried Samarkand, Uzbekistan) # Shaikh Muhammad Amkanaki, (after which moved to India; d. 1008 AH, buried Akang, Bukhara, Uzbekistan) # Shaikh Muhammad Baqi Billah Berang, (d. 1012 AH, buried Delhi, India) # Shaikh Ahmad Faruqi Sirhindi, (d. 1034 AH, buried Sarhand, India (1564‚Äì1624 CE)) # Muhammad Masum Sirhindi, (d. 1079 AH, buried Sarhand, India) # Muhammad Saifuddin Faruqi Mujaddidi, (d. 1096 AH, buried Sarhand, India) # Hafiz Muhammad Mohsin (Delhi, India, d. 1147 AH) # Sayyid Nur Muhammad Badayuni, (India, d. 1135 AH) # Mirza Mazhar Jan-e-Janaan, (Delhi, India, d. 1195 AH) # Abdullah Dahlawi, alias Shah Ghulam Ali Dehlavi, (d. 1240 AH) # Shaikh Abu-Saeed Faruqi Mujaddidi, (buried in Delhi, India, d. 1250 AH) # Shaikh Shah Ahmed Saeed Faruqi Mujaddidi, (buried in Madinah, d. 1277 AH) # Khwaja Dost Muhammad Qandhari, Musa Zai Sharif, (Dera Ismail, Pakistan, d. 1284 AH) His Khulafa :* Khwaja Muhammad Usman Damani, his successor :* Mawlana Rahim Bakhsh Punjabi, who was sent to take charge of Khanqah Mazharia in Delhi :* Mawlana Amanullah Herati (his spiritual legacy is still active in Iran) :* Mawlana Ahmed Deen, teacher of Sayyad Laal Shah Hamdani :* Mawlana Muhammad Adil (he entered the tariqah after a long debate with the shaykh) :* Mawlana Nizamuddin References * *  External links  * Jalwa Gah-e-Dost (Urdu) 2nd edition (2008) by Khwaja Muhammad Tahir Abbasi * Short Biography in Urdu by Mukhtar Ahmed Khokhar * Photograph of the grave (mazar) of Dost Muhammad in Musazai Sharif Category:1800s births Category:1868 deaths Category:People from Kandahar Category:Naqshbandi order Category:19th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Category:Sunni Muslim scholars Category:Afghan Sufis Category:Afghan Sufi saints Category:Sufi teachers Category:Sufism in Pakistan ","title":"Haji Dost Muhammad Qandhari"},{"id":"24948035","text":"Gerald Piesinger (born August 16, 1959) is a retired football defender from Austria.

The BCT CC controls the Class I unmanned aerial system (UAS), the Multifunctional Utility/Logistics and Equipment vehicle (MULE), the XM1216 Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle (SUGV), and urban unattended ground sensors (U-UGS). The BCT CC will communicate via the network in Spiral 2/3/4, will perform selected training, logistics/maintenance, medical, and other soldier functions. As of December 2012, the US Army did not have a networked central control device for various unmanned platforms and sensors within the BCT. Still in development, the BCT CC will provide that capability and will be sent to the BCTs as it technologically matures.

Early life  She was the youngest daughter of David Lee, a New York merchant, and Anne Duryee Phillips Lee.Crowning Glory. American Wives of Princes and Dukes. Richard J. Hutto. Henchard Press, Macon, Ga., 2007, 136 When David Lee died, he left his widow and five children a large fortune, and they moved to Europe in January 1853. The second daughter, Blanche, married Augustus Charles Murray, a commander in the British navy, and the third, Josephine (1833‚Äì1930), married Baron August von Waechter, ambassador of the King of W√ºrttemberg to the court of Napoleon III. Personal life Mary's elder sister, the Baroness von Waechter, sent for her to live with her in Paris, where she met and later married Prince Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg on 3 November 1864. Prince Frederick was a son of Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark, who had been driven into exile by the Austro-Prussian army in 1864. Prince Frederick, a widower, had four children with his first wife, Countess Henriette of Danneskjold-Sams√∏e. Frederick's brother was married his Henriette's elder sister. Mary Lee, not wishing to enter into a morganatic marriage, induced the prince to renounce his rights and titles as a member of the royal house of Denmark.Crowning Glory, 137 He subsequently accepted from the Emperor of Austria the title of Prince of Noer, from the name of his principal estate, and she was made Princess of N√∂er.Crowning Glory, 137 The prince died during the summer after his marriage while on a trip to the Holy Land, on 2 July 1865, leaving her his $4,000,000 estate. The princess then returned to Paris, where she resided with her sister, Baroness von Waechter, until the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War, when she accompanied the latter to W√ºrttemberg. Second marriage On 14 April 1874, she married Count Alfred von Waldersee, a German military officer. She was particularly close to her first husband's niece, Augusta Victoria, who became the German Empress, and this close relationship also came to include Wilhelm II, who was a frequent guest of the Waldersees in Berlin.View of the Spree. Alson J. Smith. The John Day Company, New York, 1962, 79 The relationship may have developed into a physical one, according to Alson J. Smith in A View of the Spree, after the Waldersees moved to Berlin.View of the Spree, 82 There, she soon became widely known through her political salon and her interest in local charities. While she resided in Berlin, she was equally zealous in good works. For some years, she worked with the antisemitic Reverend Adolf Stoecker, director of the Berlin City Mission.View of the Spree, 60 Though she may not have been aware of Stoecker's antisemitism, she did help him obtain a court chaplaincy in 1874, which he filled until 1890.View of the Spree, 62 She was for years the friend of German Emperor Frederick III and of Empress Victoria, until the women fell out over the direction in which Germany should move. Empress Victoria envisioned an English-style constitutional monarchy, while Countess von Waldersee wanted \\"...the crown to rest on the head of a pious and socially concerned Christian ruler, but one who was also a politically conservative Pan-German nationalist in the Prussian rather than the English tradition.\\"View of the Spree, 86 She continued a pious life in Altona and Hannover, where her husband was appointed to, and supported the German branch of YMCA, founded by her friend Friedrich von Schl√ºmbach, as well as other charitable organizations, like the Hamburg City Mission.

It was the first Sony Ericsson smartphone to run the Android operating system. The phone was shipped with Android 1.6 (Donut), but an upgrade to 2.1 (Eclair) was made available starting 31 October 2010, with a gradual international rollout. Originally, Sony Ericsson stated that the X10 would not receive an upgrade to Android 2.2 (Froyo) or beyond, but the phone was later upgraded to 2.3.3 (Gingerbread) with the updates starting on 29 July 2011. The phone features an 8.1 MP camera and a 1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU. Its screen has a widescreen resolution, 480 x 854 pixels, and features a virtual keyboard rather than a physical one. It makes use of HSPA (3G+) for its mobile connection, giving it top download speeds of 7.2 Mbit/s. The UX platform features two applications which allow the user to consolidate all of their communications and media, Timescape and Mediascape, respectively. Reception The Xperia X10 was first revealed on 3 November 2009. It was first released in Japan on 1 April 2010, and has since become the quickest-selling smartphone for NTT DoCoMo. The overall response has been positive for the hardware, camera and screen. There were negative comments about the lack of support for Android 2.1 which were quelled when it was released later that year. Hardware The display is a wide TFT Capacitive touchscreen, with a 16:9 aspect ratio and FWVGA resolution of 480 x 854 pixels, along with a multi-touch enabled screen, the first from Sony. The 8.1-megapixel camera features 16x digital zoom, image stabilization, auto- focus, geo-tagging, smile detection, and face detection. It can also record video, with an LED for use in poor light conditions. It has a 3-axis accelerometer and built in GPS. Its CPU is 1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon QSD8250 with its GPU is Adreno 200 (AMD Z430). The hardware is limited in its multi- touch functionality. It can only track multiple touches where their X and Y coordinates are different. The firmware to enable this functionality was first released in Japan. Networks The Xperia X10 uses the 850/900/1800/1900 frequency bands for GSM. Both versions use 850/900/1800/1900 frequency bands for GSM while they differ regarding the UMTS frequency bands; the X10a uses 800/850/1900/2100 bands, and the X10i uses 900/1700/2100. The X10a is used by AT&T; Mobility in the US, Telstra in Australia, and Rogers Wireless in Canada. It is also used in South America. The X10i is used by T-Mobile in the USA; Wind Mobile and Mobilicity in Canada; Optus and VHA (under both the Vodafone and 3 brands) in Australia; Singtel, Starhub and M1 in Singapore; and through the rest of Asia, Europe, and Oceania. In Japan, it is called the SO-01B and sold by NTT Docomo, using the X10a configuration. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi The X10 has built in Wi-Fi b/g and Bluetooth 2.1, with the option to tether other devices. With the Android 2.3 update, the phone can also create a Wi-Fi hotspot. Software Sony Ericsson has its own Android overlay called UX, short for User eXperience. It consists of design elements, themes and custom applications. The main applications are Sony Ericsson Timescape and Sony Ericsson Mediascape. Timescape is a program that brings together Facebook, Twitter, SMS, and email into a column on the home screen. Mediascape is a player and library application for media files. It can also connect to Facebook and Picasa accounts and to the phone's contacts list. This makes it possible to attach photos users have taken with the camera to their contacts or send them directly to their Facebook account. Updates The Xperia X10 was released with Android 1.6, with an upgrade to Android 2.1 released on 31 October 2010. On 20 January 21, an update was released which enabled multi- touch. On 1 February 2011, Sony Ericsson announced a futur update for Xperia X10 that would bring optimizations and bug fixes along with language additions and the pinch-to-zoom feature. On 29 July 2011, the Android 2.3.3 update was released. Rooting As of 1 April 2011, the bootloader has been bypassed via kexec which enables the loading of custom kernels. Custom ROMs have been developed, however they still use the 2.1 kernel so some features such as native Wi-Fi tethering are missing. As of 20 January 2011 there are two custom roms being developed based on 2.2 (both of which have working camera drivers). All X10 devices running the Gingerbread firmware (2.3.x) are vulnerable to the zergRush rooting method. Issues The initial 3UK (and possibly other Mobile Operators) release of firmware contained bugs. Some users have reported Wi-Fi connection disruptions in early software versions.Xperia X10 WiFi bug found Several users from sonyericsson, and 4pda forums reported a self- rebooting bug on their X10i's. It is believed the bug appears because of defects on the phone's motherboard. Since the Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) update the phone has suffered a stuttering in play or streaming of music regardless of file association. The only solution currently is to root the phone and apply a patch located on the XDA developers forum. Sony refuses to acknowledge the problem and have as of late offered no solution to this bug. Xperia Series Sony Ericsson announced two mini versions of the Xperia X10 at the Mobile World Congress 2010. The X10 Mini and the X10 Mini Pro were released in June 2010.

Work Soft sculpture =Cyanotype= In 1969 Jansen created the Soft Tea Set, a scaled to life, photographic, three- dimensional object using a formula of potassium ferrocyanide and citric acid, which she developed specifically for cloth material. Stitching the imaged fabric together and stuffing it, she was the first to use this photographic process in a sculptural format. Jansen‚Äôs innovations with this blue print formula culminated in the first use of photography to create a scaled to life room environment using cyanotype on cloth.Frontiers of Photography.

Article and photograph, Blue Room The Blue Room is part of the permanent collection at the Michener Museum of Art in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. =Color copier= Jansen was the first artist to extensively explore the potential of the electronic color copier process using electronically generated images that preceded the digital camera and computer technology. Her first scaled to life room environment using this process was The Bathroom with Satin Sink and Taffeta Toilet.Snyder, Norman, ed. The Photography Catalog. New York: Harper & Row, 1976: 189. Half page article and photograph of Soft Bathroom This installation is part of the permanent collection at the Honolulu Museum of Art Museum in Hawaii. This process using the color copier, the precursor to the digital age, evolved into the Soft House Project, a five-room scaled to life house environment, utilizing thousands of photographic images.Sorlien, Sandy. \\"Women's Work: Catherine Jansen.\\" Photo Review Winter 1994: 14-15. Article on Soft House Project, Photographs of Sewing Space While developing this protocol Jansen developed a method for photographing the figure full scale on cloth, as well as rendering three-dimensional objects on cloth. The life size portrait on cloth, Erika, is in the permanent collection at the Center for Creative Photography in Tucson, Arizona. Between 1971-1976 Jansen was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts grant and two Pennsylvania Council on the Arts grants to complete a scaled to life five room house using color copier technology. Other photographic processes In 1977 Jansen built a Kirlian photographic gold screen unit and spent several years exploring, generating, and utilizing Kirlian photography on cloth as a fine art expression. In 1985, by photographing the same object from multiple vantage points and stitching layers of cloth together, she created a protocol for making a photographic image appear three-dimensional. Throughout the 1990s Jansen was involved with the ongoing Thirsty River project, in which she utilized 77 yards of fabric strategically laid it out in the landscape to reflect the light of the rising sun.Ryesky, Helene. \\"Catherine Jansen.\\" Photo Review Winter 2000: 21-22.

Images of Thirsty River In 1995 Jansen, with a team of students, created 75 costumes for the Copernicus Project.Robert Marcelonis Robert Marcelonis These innovative cloth costumes, also considered wearable sculpture, used photographic imagery to express content as well provide decorative elements Images of Copernicus costumes They were exhibited at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and are part of the permanent collection at the Michener Museum of Art. Digital From the late 1990s to today, Jansen has been working with a digital camera and Adobe Photoshop to create a visual vocabulary that builds photographs into a long format that can express psychological and emotional time and space within the image. This work has coincided with 15 trips to India, and is an ongoing project called The Nada Series. Images of The Nada Series Jansen presently lives in Wyncote, Pennsylvania and spends three and a half months out of every year in India. While there, she spends her time volunteering at Little Stars School for street children and orphans, as well as working on her Nada Series.

It was designed and built by an amateur group drawn from staff and pupils at the RAF College Cranwell. Though it won one prize and set a Class record, only one CLA.3 was made. Design and development The Cranwell Light Aeroplane (CLA) club was formed in 1923 by staff and students at the RAF College Cranwell. The students came from No.4 Apprentices Wing and one of their lecturers, Flt-Lt Nicholas Comper became chief designer of the three aircraft produced by the club as well as one, the CLA.1 that was not completed. Their first finished aircraft, the CLA.2 won a ¬£300 prize at the Lympne trials in 1924, but was a rather slow biplane, and Comper decided to design something much quicker for the 1925 Lympne event. The result was the CLA.3, a single-engined parasol winged single seater.Flight 30 July 1925 p.484-7 The wings of the CLA.3 were straight and had constant chord apart from at the rounded tips. The airfoil section used, the Eiffel 371Although Gustave Eiffel is best known for his large engineering structures, principally the Eiffel tower and the armature of the Statue of Liberty, he did important work in aerodynamics from 1909 onwards (Anderson 1997, pp.268-282), using his own, large wind tunnels to establish the pressure distributions over aerodynamic surfaces was something of a novelty, a thick wing with a quite flat bottom. The wings were built on two I-section spruce spars and fabric covered everywhere apart from at the leading edge, where thin aluminium was used. Differential ailerons were fitted; initially the gap between aileron and wing was filled with narrow rubber flaps, but later they were removed as they added weight and made lateral control heavy. The wings were held about 7 in (180 mm) above the fuselage, parasol fashion, by two steel lift struts on each side which ran from a common point on the lower longeron of the fuselage to the front and rear spars at mid-span. Three vertical steel cabane struts on each side joined the centre section to the upper longerons. The rear part of the fuselage was a Warren girder based on four longerons, tapering towards the tail. The fuselage cross section was kept to a minimum to reduce drag and to this end the pilot sat on the cockpit floor. There were concerns about ease of escape from this position under the rear wing spar, but it was after all, a racing machine. In front of him the structure was wire braced, the longerons converging to become overhung engine bearers. The 32 hp (24 kW) Bristol Cherub II engine was mounted on a plate with a fireproof bulkhead, within a long, smooth aluminium cowling blended into the spinner of the two-bladed propeller. The Cherub's cylinder heads were exposed for cooling. A rounded decking, built up with stringers in the usual way, topped the fuselage from propeller to stern and contained the 4.5 imp gal tank immediately in front of the cockpit, high enough above the engine to allow it to be gravity fed. The overall fin plus rudder shape was not unlike the de Havilland form, though the rudder was not balanced. The tailplane had a straight leading edge inboard, then curved; it could be adjusted in incidence on the ground but not in the air. Its elevators were unbalanced and divided to allow rudder movement. The undercarriage was a simple single axle design using rubber shock absorbers, with the main legs attached to the lower longerons at the same points as the lift struts and braced to the most forward fuselage frame. It was completed with a tail skid. Nick Comper took the CLA.3 for its first flight in mid-July 1925. The only significant later modification exchanged the geared Cherub II for a direct drive 36 hp (27 kW) Cherub III, fitted with a metal propeller. Operational history Comper was still getting to know the CLA.3 when he flew it at the Royal Aero Club (RAC) race meeting Lympne in August 1925.Flight 6 August 1925 p.505-6 It was the only new aircraft there. Several of the races were handicaps and did not reward the CLA.3, but it did win the Single-Seater Light 'Plane Scratch Speed Race and the accompanying ¬£50 prize, albeit against only three other competitors. There was also a series of competitions to establish records in the light aeroplane Class, defined by the RAC as those with an engine weight of less than 170 lb (77 kg). The CLA.3 was the fastest out of a field of nine over 3 km, at a speed of 139.89 km/h. (86.9 mph). The same group of aircraft competed over 50 km, and here the CLA.3 came a close second at 135.5 km.h. (84.25 mph). In 1926, fitted with the Cherub III it flew in the King's Cup Race, but engine failure forced it out. The sole CLA.3 was scrapped in 1929.

Life After the death of his second wife Rikissa of Sweden around 1292, Duke Przemys≈Ç II of Greater Poland wished to marry for a third time. The choice of Margaret was mainly for political reasons, because for being a member of the powerful House of Ascania and her Pomerelian ancestry (her maternal grandmother was Sambiria of Pomerelia, later Queen Margaret of Denmark), this would have given to the Greater Poland ruler additional rights over his expected inheritance of Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania. Given the relatively close relationship between Przemys≈Ç II and Margaret (both were great-grandchildren of P≈ôemysl Otakar I of Bohemia), they needed a papal dispensation in order to marry.K.

It was the first coronation of a Polish king and queen in 219 years. Margaret was the first undisputed queen consort of Poland since Richeza of Lotharingia during the 11th century. Przemys≈Ç II's reign didn't last long. On 8 February 1296, he was kidnapped by men of Margaret's family, with some help from the Polish noble families of Na≈Çƒôcz and Zaremba and murdered in Rogo≈∫no by Jakub Kaszuba. German chronicler Dietmar of L√ºbeck pointed that Margaret took part in the conspiracy who killed her husband, due to her family relations.Interpretation of the text by K. Jasi≈Ñski: Tragedia rogozi≈Ñska 1296 roku na tle rywalizacji wielkopolsko- brandenburskiej o Pomorze Gda≈Ñskie, [in:] \\"Zapiski Historyczne\\", vol. XXVI, t. 4, Toru≈Ñ 1961, p. 72. It's unknown whether the chronicler found this information, from earlier sources or deduced it based on the simple relationship: because Margaret came from the family accused of the murder, she had to participate. Margaret, now queen dowager, stayed in Poland (where she received parts of Greater Poland as her dower, according to a Piast dynasty custom) and took care of her stepdaughter Ryksa, future wife of her brother Otto. Shortly after, and for unknown reasons, Margaret returned to Brandenburg, taking Ryksa with her. Once in her homeland, Margaret was engaged with Nicholas I the Child, Lord of Rostock and member of the House of Mecklenburg; however, in 1299 the betrothal was broken by Nicholas I, who chose to marry a Pomeranian princess. Around this time, her stepdaughter Ryksa returned to Poland after the death of her intended husband. Sometime later, another marriage was arranged to Margaret, this time with Albert III, who ruled jointly with his brothers Eric I and John II the Duchy of Saxe- Lauenburg, partitioned from Saxony in 1296. Because Albert III and Margaret are closely related (both are members of the House of Ascania), a papal dispensation was granted in Anagni on 24 September 1302; the marriage was probably celebrated shortly after. They had two sons: Albert (d. 1344; married to Sophie of Ziegenhain, apparently without issue) and Eric (d. 1338, unmarried). In 1303 Albert III and his brothers divided Saxe-Lauenburg into three branch duchies. Albert III and Margaret then held Saxe-Ratzeburg. After Albert III's death in 1308, his brother Eric I inherited part of Albert's share, while Margaret retained the other part, in order to bring up her children. Margaret died in 1315 and was buried in Ratzeburg Cathedral. On her death Eric I also took her share of Ratzenburg.Cordula Bornefeld, \\"Die Herz√∂ge von Sachsen-Lauenburg\\", in: Die F√ºrsten des Landes: Herz√∂ge und Grafen von Schleswig, Holstein und Lauenburg [De slevigske hertuger; German], Carsten Porskrog Rasmussen (ed.) on behalf of the Gesellschaft f√ºr Schleswig- Holsteinische Geschichte, Neum√ºnster: Wachholtz, 2008, pp. 373-389, here p. 377.

However, their reign was short-lived: in 1177 Mieszko III's eldest son Odon rebelled against him, with the help of his uncle Casimir II the Just. The main reason of Odon's rebellion was the favoritism showed by Mieszko III to his children with Eudoxia, and the attempts of the High Duke to force him to become a priest, in order to eliminated from the succession. Mieszko III was forced to escape and went to Bohemia (where he asked the help of his son-in-law Duke Sobeslav II unsuccessfully), Germany and Pomerania (there, Mieszko III obtain the support of his other son-in-law Duke Bogislaw I).

Usually, these numbers are programmed to forward incoming calls to one of the pre-set telephone numbers, chosen by the client: fixed, mobile or VoIP. A virtual number can work like a gateway between traditional calls (PSTN) and VoIP. Subscribers to virtual numbers may use their existing phones, without the need to purchase additional hardware, i.e. use the numerous available software. A virtual private number is a telephone number that forwards incoming calls to any of a number of pre-set telephone numbers. These are also called a follow- me number, a virtual telephone number or (in the UK) Personal Number. Usually a virtual telephone number can be set to forward calls to different telephone numbers depending on the time of day and the day of the week using time of day routing; for example, between 9 and 5 on working days incoming calls will be forwarded to one's workplace, but in the weekends to one's cellphone. The availability (and acceptable use) of virtual phone numbers are subject to the regulatory situation in the issuing country.  Applications and example of use  * Businesses ‚Äì A company located in China can have a phone number in Los Angeles or London without paying for a fixed foreign exchange line. Virtual numbers are very popular among call centers which appear to be located in one country, when they are in one or more countries in different time zone, delivering efficient 24/7 cover. * Individuals ‚Äì Other popular users of international virtual numbers are migrants and travelers, who appreciate that their friends and family back home can contact them using a local call. * Specific businesses ‚Äì Calling cards or callback. Virtual numbers work like access numbers, e.g., the phone number that (calling cards) or callback's user has to dial to make the call/(use callback). * Marketing ‚Äì Some companies use virtual numbers for various marketing campaigns, or different media channels; this allows them to track which campaign or medium brings what kind of traffic. * Virtual services ‚Äì Various providers of virtual business services (virtual address, virtual receptionist, virtual office) will use a virtual number to tie in their other virtual services together. This allows their customers to have a phone, address and voice presence almost anywhere in the world. Most voice over IP providers offer virtual numbers; unbundled providers label these as \\"DIDs\\" (direct inward dial). These are typically offered as local geographic numbers in various selected cities or as toll-free numbers, with the non-geographic number carrying higher per-minute cost to receive calls. In the North American Numbering Plan, Area code 500 and Area code 533 are follow-me numbers, and referred to as Personal Communications Service (NANP).

The project seeks to address the issue of a shortage of teachers in Chicago's public schools by focusing on recruitment, urban teacher preparation, community-based clinical experiences, faculty development and research. Program focus The focus of the program is to develop sustainable responses to challenges faced by urban school districts in hiring effective teachers. Jacob, Brian A. (2007). The Challenges of Staffing Urban Schools with Effective Teachers, Excellence in the Classroom, 17, 1. Retrieved November 3, 2009 from http://www.princeton.edu/futureofchildren/publications/docs/17_01_07.pdf The Chicago Teacher Pipeline works with its partners to address urban teacher shortages by: * preparing teachers to live and work in urban settings * recruiting students from urban schools for teacher preparation and then returning them home to teach * providing community-based clinical experiences * assisting with faculty development and research Teacher recruitment First-year teachers tend to choose to teach in school districts near to where they grew up. By preparing student teachers to live and work in urban settings, and by recruiting students from urban schools for teacher preparation, the Chicago Teacher Education Pipeline works to provide Chicago Public Schools with a continuous supply of well-trained multicultural teachers. The project also offers a variety of professional development, research, and services to community members and students. Community-based facility The Chicago Teacher Education Pipeline project is currently working to establish a community-based facility that provides: * affordable housing for interns/student teachers * overnight lodging for Illinois State University professors * classroom space for seminars and other instruction * computer/Internet instructional laboratory and space for groups with related missions to provide other services. Partnership initiatives The Professional Articulation for Recruiting/Retaining Teachers for Neighborhood Engagement and Renewal (PARTNER) Project will increase the number of individuals from the Little Village community who enter teacher education programs and return to Chicago to teach. The PARTNER Project is supported by a grant from the United States Department of Education. The Initiative for Education Renewal, made possible by State Farm Insurance Company Foundation Grant NEIGHBORS Project, leverages placement of teacher candidates (resident interns) in yearlong Professional Development Schools, thereby integrating their university learning with on-the-job learning. Grants and awards In 2008, the Chicago Teacher Education Pipeline Programs and Partnership received the following awards: * A Grow Your Own planning grant through the Illinois State Board of Education * The American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) Best Practice Award in Support of Global Diversity and Inclusion * The Nicholas Michelli Award for Promoting Social Justice from the National Network for Educational Renewal (NNER).

The Ch√¢teau de L'Isle-Adam, now destroyed, could be found in the town of L'Isle-Adam in the department of Val-d'Oise; it was built on an island called the √éle du Prieur√© The building was connected with many illustrious families; the Lords of Adams, the Dukes of Villiers, the Dukes of Montmorency, the Princes of Cond√© and finally the Princes of Conti. It was under the Princes of Conti that the building had its golden age. They lived there for seven generations and it was their principal residence outside Paris. Their Parisian home was the H√¥tel de Conti. It was entirely destroyed by the 19th century. L'Isle Adam is situated on a series of three isles History To stop invasion by the Normans, the King of France ordered the construction of a series of fortresses in order to defend his lands from his enemy. The first series of buildings on the site were in fact constructed in 825 along the two islands in L'Isle-Adam bordering the River Oise near where the present town of Nogent is today. The latter was not recorded till 1069 but was near the site. The ch√¢teau was given to one Seigneur Adam, literally \\"Lord Adam\\". From then on, the ch√¢teau was known as ch√¢teau de L'Isle-Adam. Around the ch√¢teau the town of L'Isle Adam grew and eventually met Nogent which was later swallowed by L'Isle Adam. By the Middle Ages, the Lordship grew and included the properties of Parmain and Valmondois. Over this period the ch√¢teau increased in size and was remodelled according to contemporary tastes. The √éle du Prieur√©, or \\"Isle of the Priory\\", was first built on by Saint Chrodegand in 1014. The √éle du Prieur√© was where the ch√¢teau was built on. L'Isle-Adam before the Conti L'Isle Adam lived quietly till 1360 when it was sold to Pierre Villiers, the Grand Master of the Kings household. It was later the property of his descendant who took the style of Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam. Philippe (1464‚Äì1534) was a prominent member of the Knights Hospitaller at Rhodes and later Malta. Having risen to the position of Prior of the Langue of Auvergne, he was elected Grand Master of the Order in 1521. In turn, Philippe's descendant Antoine Villiers de L'Isle- Adam, heir to the domain married Marguerite de Montmorency, a member of the Montmorency family who were created Dukes in the reign of Henry II of France. By this marriage, L'Isle-Adam was gained by the Montmorency family. In September 1527, the son of Antoine Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, Charles, bought the rights of purchase from all his siblings to stop the breakup of the estate. It was he who gave it to Anne de Montmorency, Honorary Knight of the Garter, soldier, statesman, diplomat, Marshal of France and then Constable of France. It was Anne who rebuilt the ch√¢teau and a mill which was situated on the bridge. Later on, Anne's grandson Henri de Montmorency was executed on the command of Louis XIII having been part of a conspiracy with Gaston d'Orl√©ans. Executed in Toulouse, Henri had all his property confiscated from him and this included L'Isle Adam. Despite this, Louis XIII allowed the family properties to be returned to various members of the Montmorency family. As such, due to the Montmorency male line dying out with Henri in 1632, his sister Charlotte Marguerite became the owner of L'Isle Adam as well as the Duchy of Montmorency. Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency married Henri de Bourbon, prince de Cond√© in 1609. Henri was a second cousin of Henry IV of France, held the rank of First Prince of the Blood and was the head of the incorrectly called Bourbon-Cond√© branch of the reigning House of Bourbon. Charlotte Marguerite was later Henry IV's mistress. From Cond√© to Conti At the death of Henri de Bourbon (Charlotte Marguerite's husband) in 1651, the Cond√© estate was divided up between their three children: *Anne Genevi√®ve, duchesse de Longueville (1619‚Äì1679) *Louis, le Grand Cond√© (1621‚Äì1686) *Armand, prince de Conti (1629‚Äì1666) L'Isle Adam was given to Armand, the Prince of Conti since 1629. It was he who founded another cadet branch, another incorrectly named Bourbon-Conti line. The Conti line would remain in possession of L'Isle Adam right up to the French Revolution. Armand de Bourbon was named the governor of Languedoc in 1660 having taken command of the army which in 1654, invaded Catalonia, where he captured three towns from the Spaniards. He afterwards led the French forces in Italy, but after his defeat before Alessandria in 1657 retired to Languedoc, where he devoted himself to study and mysticism until his death. As such Armand never paid L'Isle Adam much attention, dying in 1666 at his residence at P√©zenas, southern France. Armand's widow Anne Marie Martinozzi, niece of Cardinal Mazarin, stayed at the ch√¢teau. Presumably she was there on the night of 30 June to 1 July 1669 when the ch√¢teau was destroyed by fire. The reconstruction of the building continued speedily till 1671 when it was again habitable. Armand and Anne Marie had two sons which survived infancy; Louis Armand (1661‚Äì1685) and the famous Fran√ßois Louis, le Grand Conti. Louis Armand married Marie Anne de Bourbon, daughter of Louis XIV and Louise de La Valli√®re but had no issue; Fran√ßois Louis, known to history as le Grand Conti, was greatly interested in his estates and showed a particular liking to L'Isle Adam. He married his first cousin's daughter Marie Th√©r√®se de Bourbon. Marie Th√©r√®se, who loved her husband passionately, was ignored by her husband who often unfaithful with members of both sexes. Despite this the couple had seven children, three of which survived into adulthood. In 1707, le Grand Conti managed to buy the whole of the √éle du Prieur√© from Jean-Fran√ßois de Chamillart, Bishop of Senlis and Prior of the earlier mentioned Saint Chrodegand. Conti also had the building remodelled to suit modern tastes and redecorated it greatly. He died in 1709 from a combination of gout and syphilis. His widow Marie Th√©r√®se lived at the property in her later life herself dying in Paris in 1732. The ch√¢teau went through a quiet stage until Louis Fran√ßois de Bourbon, grandson of le Grand Conti, enlarged the estate by purchasing the Ch√¢teau de Stors from the marquis de Verderonne in 1746. Having lost his wife Louise Diane d'Orl√©ans in childbirth in 1736 at Issy, Louis Fran√ßois retired to L'Isle Adam for two years where he threw himself into the excellent hunting space around the ch√¢teau. It was he who often had magnificent parties on the estate. The Destruction The Conti residence was confiscated during the revolution, it was sold to Monsieur Heyer in 1798 who demolished it in parts. By 1813 nothing was left of the stunning residence. On 12 May 1821, Madame Papon, widow of Monsieur Christophe Ducamp, bought the lands of Parmain as well as all the √éle du Prieur√© and much land within the town of L'Isle Adam. At first she constructed a beautiful abode at Parmain (1828), but this property was damaged in 1846 by the arrival of the railway. In 1857, Madame Papon therefore undertook the construction of a small property on the √éle du Prieur√© in the Louis XIII style on the location of the former Conti ch√¢teau. The new castle, built in 1858, is the property of the municipality of l'Isle-Adam Later on, the property passed onto Monsieur Am√©d√©e Bread, then to his son, Henri Bread, diplomat and composer. The property was burned by the Prussians during the war of 1870. The castle was again rebuilt and uses as a hotel. It was then bought in 1985 by a group of corporations related to the exploitation of oil. It was the bought by the L'Isle-Adam municipality in 2005. Site Three leagues from Pontoise and six leagues from Chantilly, L'Isle-Adam and the castle was on the extreme north of the √éle du Prieur√©, between the hamlet of Parmain, on the right shore of the Oise, and the town of L'Isle-Adam, on the left shore. A bridge linked up the √éle du Prieur√© to Parmain and another to the L'√Æle de la Cohue. The site presented evident strategic interest, allowing the Middle Ages to check the passage on the Oise. In addition, the abundance of water was a defensive part and later helped irrigate the gardens of the various owners. On the other hand, the island created great constraint's for the architects. who had to clearly work on a difficult but unique site. Also, the irregularity of the course of the Oise and the nature of the land, caused serious problems for stability, infiltrations and of undermine.

It was located in Jackson County, Choctaw Nation, the county seat of which was Pigeon Roost, south of present-day Boswell. It ceased its functions upon preparation for Oklahoma‚Äôs statehood in 1907, when the Choctaw Nation‚Äôs government and political subdivisions were dissolved. History Mayhew was founded in 1836 by Presbyterian missionaries to the Choctaw Indians. They named it for Mayhew Presbyterian Mission in Mississippi.George H. Shirk, Oklahoma Place Names, p. 138. From here they ministered to the Choctaws, providing schooling, medical aid, and other services. A United States Post Office was established at Mayhew, Indian Territory on February 5, 1845 and operated until September 30, 1902. It then moved two miles south to Boswell, which was then a new townsite along the new railroad, and changed its name to Boswell, Indian Territory. Boswell was named for S.C. Boswell, a local merchant. Shirk, Oklahoma Place Names, p. 27. Mayhew was visited by a Works Progress Administration field worker in September 1936. At that time she reported the remains of the original site of Mayhew--a half- mile away from its second and last site--were torn down in 1934. The last site of Mayhew still held the steel jailhouse constructed during territorial days to hold the prisoners of the Pushmataha District (Third District) of the Choctaw Nation. The jailhouse was originally located at the first site of the district court, near the present-day Choctaw County community of Sunkist, and was moved to Mayhew in 1903. (The Pushmataha District had abandoned the site of its first courthouse after it burned. Its remote location between the forks of the Clear Boggy River and Muddy Boggy River caused it to move to Mayhew, the court's last seat before Oklahoma's statehood, rather than rebuild.) In 1936 it was still in excellent condition and being used as a granary. The original \\"whipping tree\\", from which the court dispensed punishment to those convicted of crimes, had been chopped down.Account of Jennie Selfridge, WPA worker, September 1936. The account appears in the Indian-Pioneer Papers held by the Western History Collections of the University of Oklahoma Libraries.

WOFF files are OpenType or TrueType fonts, with format-specific compression applied and additional XML metadata added. The two primary goals are to first distinguish font files intended for use as web fonts from fonts files intended for use in desktop applications via local installation, and second to reduce web font latency when fonts are transferred from a server to a client over a network connection.  Standardization  The first draft of WOFF 1 was published in 2009 by Jonathan Kew, Tal Leming, and Erik van Blokland, with reference conversion code written by Jonathan Kew. Following the submission of WOFF to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) by the Mozilla Foundation, Opera Software and Microsoft in April 2010,WOFF File Format 1.0 Submission Request to W3C the W3C commented that it expected WOFF to soon become the \\"single, interoperable format\\" supported by all browsers.Team Comment on \\"WOFF File Format 1.0\\" Submission The W3C published WOFF as a working draft in July 2010. The final draft was published as a W3C Recommendation on 13 December 2012. WOFF 2.0, with reference code provided by Google, has an improved compression scheme, using Brotli for byte-level compression, and became a W3C Recommendation in March 2018.W3C: WOFF File Format 2.0  Specification  WOFF is a wrapper containing SFNT-based fonts (TrueType or OpenType) that have been compressed using a WOFF-specific encoding tool so they can be embedded in a Web page. WOFF Version 1 uses the widely available zlib compression (specifically, the compress2 function), typically resulting in a file size reduction for TrueType files of over 40%. Since OpenType CFF files (with PostScript glyph outlines) are already compressed, their reduction is typically smaller.http://blog.typekit.com/2010/12/08/type-rendering-font- outlines-and-file-formats/  Vendor support  Each version of the format has received the backing of many font vendors, also known as type foundries, and has been supported by all major browsers: * Firefox since version 3.6 * Google Chrome since version 6.0 * Internet Explorer since version 9 * Konqueror since KDE 4.4.1 * Microsoft Edge * Opera since version 11.10 (Presto 2.7.81) * Safari 5.1 * other WebKit-based browsers since WebKit build 528 WOFF 2.0, based on the Brotli compression algorithm and other improvements over WOFF 1.0 giving more than 30% reduction in file size, is supported in * Google Chrome (since version 36), * Edge (since version 14), * Opera (since version 26), * Firefox (since version 35) * Safari (since version 10). Some browsers enforce a same-origin policy, preventing WOFF fonts from being used across different domains. This restriction is part of the CSS 3 Fonts module,CSS Fonts Module Level 3 where it applies to all font formats and can be overridden by the server providing the font. Some servers may require the manual addition of WOFF's MIME type to serve the files correctly. Since February 2017, the proper MIME type is \`font/woff\` for WOFF 1.0 and \`font/woff2\` for WOFF 2.0.

He operated in the Russian Empire. He was a close friend of Alexander Mantashyants and his charitable contributions rivaled those of fellow oil magnate.  Biography  Mikael Aramyants was born on 4 May 1843 in Karabakh. Thereafter, he moved to Tbilisi contributed to the development of trade, health, education and culture. Mikael Aramyants was permanent sponsor of the Armenian Nersisian School in Tiflis (now Tbilisi). He was a successful sugar and cotton businessman, owner of professional, profitable houses, estates, lands, cottages and resorts, and especially of Akhtala and Kislovodsk health resorts owner and director. In Tbilisi, Aramyants founded the Aramiants Hospital, now Clinical Hospital No. 1, though it is still called the Aramiants hospital by old people living in Tbilisi. He equipped ‚ÄòAramiants hospital‚Äô with the newest and best medical apparatus of the time. He was instrumental in bringing the first X-ray to Tbilisi from Europe in order to help to diagnose people and cure them. As contemporaneous observers suggest, this was a large hospital complex built according to European standards. First were constructed an infectious, surgery, and maternity hospitals. Mikael Aramyants had a big role in the development of the oil industry in the Caucasus. He moved the majority of his capital to construct an oil road from Baku to Batumi. Aramyants helped to build shelters for homeless refugees of Western Armenia. The settlement later was known as \\"Aramashen 'settlement. The name of Mikael Aramyants is connected with Tbilisi Marriott Hotel which he built in the beginning of the 20th century and called it \\"Mazhestik\\" in memory of his beloved ship. After the Bolsheviks came to rule the country Aramyants lost most of his wealth and died of hunger in the basement of his hotel. It was in Aramyants' apartment that the first Armenian Republic's decree was signed.

After completing her support duties for Philadelphia, Sans Souci II resumed patrol duty in Puget Sound, frequently operating with, or alternating with, the submarine chaser USS SC-300, until 23 December 1918. She then remained inactive until she was decommissioned on 7 February 1919 and struck from the Navy List the same day. Ordered returned to her owner on 26 March 1919, Sans Souci II remained on yacht registers into the early 1930s, suggesting that she remained in private use until that time.

As a follow-up to the FCT‚Äôs evaluation of R&D; Units in 2003, the transformation of UEICSA into TERCUD was made possible by fusing several UEICSA‚Äôs constitutive elements: CESMU ‚Äì Sociomuseology Research Centre (founded in 1993), CESU ‚Äì Sociourbanism Research Centre (founded in 1996), CELC ‚Äì Linguistics and Culture Research Centre (founded in 2001) and CEGED - Geography and Development Research Centre (founded in 2002). This restructuring facilitated a more focused scientific mission and explicitly promoted synergy with education, that is, with the B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. Programs in the Faculty of Architecture, Urbanism, Geography and Arts. Objectives Following the concept that the uniqueness of natural, cultural and economic specificities are the constitutive elements of and decisive factors for the transformation of geographic space and territorial development at all scales in the context of the local/global nexus, the overall objectives of TERCUD are to design, implement and disseminate research and other scientific activities in favour of: * holistic and participatory approach to planning, management and evaluation of spatial development in urban, rural and mixed settings; * valorization of natural and cultural heritage of other material and immaterial components of territorial identities as local/regional development recourses in the context of the globalized economy and culture; Researchers The multidisciplinary character of TERCUD‚Äôs objectives and activities is guaranteed by diverse academic profiles and professional expertise of the research staff and collaborators, both Portuguese and foreign, including Physical and Human Geographers, Urban Planners and Architects, Cultural Anthropologists and Socio-Economists - all specialists in different spheres of Development Studies, with considerable international experience in fundamental, policy and applied research and consulting. Activities TERCUD‚Äôs core activities are carried out by the Main Research Groups ‚ÄúGeography of Identities and Development‚Äù, ‚ÄúSociourbanism and Spatial Planning‚Äù and ‚ÄúSociomuseology‚Äù, which are composed of the teaching staff members of the Faculty of Architecture, Urbanism, Geography and Arts.

James Albert Wales (30 August 1852 in Clyde, Ohio - 6 December 1886 in New York City) was a caricaturist. After leaving school, he apprenticed himself to a wood engraver in Toledo, but soon afterward went to Cincinnati, and thence to Cleveland, where he drew cartoons for the Leader during the presidential canvass of 1872. After working for some time in Chicago and Cleveland, he went to New York in 1873, and two years later secured an engagement on an illustrated newspaper. Afterward he was employed on Puck, in which some of his best works appeared. In 1881 he went abroad, and after his return he became one of the founders of Judge, and was for some time its chief cartoonist. He specialized in antisemitic attacks ridiculing Jews.

Early life and education Winters was born in Maryland. In high school, he played in the punk band Corm, alongside John Davis, now of Title Tracks. In 1998, he graduated from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, where he was active in the comedy group Mama's Pot Roast. Career Winters was first known as the author of the 2009 New York Times bestseller Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters. In June 2010, Android Karenina was published by Quirk Books. A young adult novel, The Secret Life of Ms. Finkleman, was published by HarperCollins in September 2010. Finkleman was nominated for an Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America in January 2011. In 2011, Winters published a second book in the Ms. Finkleman series, titled The Mystery of the Missing Everything, and Bedbugs, a horror novel for adults. Winters has also written numerous books in the Worst-Case Scenario Series. In 2012, Winters published The Last Policeman, the first in a trilogy of detective novels set in a pre-apocalyptic United States; that book won the Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in the category Best Paperback Original; was an Amazon Best Book of 2012; and was nominated for the Macavity Award for Best Mystery by Mystery Readers International. The second novel in the Last Policeman trilogy, Countdown City, was published in July 2013; it won the 2014 Philip K. Dick Award for Distinguished Science Fiction. The third book in the Policeman series, World of Trouble, was published in July 2014. It was nominated for the Edgar Award in the category of Best Paperback Original and for the Anthony Award. Winters's work for the theater includes the Off- Broadway musical Slut, the children's musicals The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere, Uncle Pirate, and A (Tooth) Fairy Tale and the Neil Sedaka juke-box musical, Breaking Up Is Hard to Do. Winters's novel Underground Airlines was published by Mulholland Books in July 2016. It is an alternate history book, set in a present-day alternate universe in which the American Civil War never occurred, with human chattel slavery continuing to be practiced legally in four U.S. states as a result. In the book, the main character, a former slave and bounty hunter working for the U.S. government, attempts to infiltrate an abolitionist organization known as the \\"Underground Airlines\\" (a reference to the historical Underground Railroad). The book was an Indie Next pick for July 2016 and a New York Times bestseller. The book won the 2016 Sidewise Award for Alternate History. His most recent novel is Golden State, published by Mulholland Books in January 2019. The novel imagines an alternate history version of Southern California in which objective reality is fetishized and protected above all things, and lying is the greatest crime imaginable. Winters has said the book was inspired by the rise of alternative facts and in particular by the argument about the crowd size at the 2017 presidential inauguration. Golden State was an Indie Next pick for January 2019 and a Book of the Month Club selection. Writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, Michael Berry called the novel \\"smart, intricate and propulsive\\" and \\"proof that Winters deserves our continued attention as one of crime fiction‚Äôs most inventive practitioners.\\" Personal life Winters lives in Los Angeles with his wife and three children.

Some municipal park district leagues and corporate leagues follow NSA guidelines to some extent, especially in what bats are not allowed in play, however most competitive leagues require bats with ASA 2004 Certification.

He stated that he saw that there was a need for an organization where it would put the teams and players first and do it better than the rest. In the autumn of 1982, the plans were set in motion for Hugh and his fledgling National Softball Association to get off the ground as incorporation papers were filed in Lexington‚Äù. The official conference took place in November of the same year and it discussed the framework and groundwork for the construction in the spring of 1983.

J/88 consisted of a headquarters (Stab) and four squadrons (Staffeln), although the 4th Staffel was short-lived. J/88 had formed on 3 November 1936. Formation The Condor Legion was an expeditionary force of soldiers and airmen sent to aid the Spanish Nationalist group during the Spanish Civil War. The Germans used the war as an opportunity to evaluate new equipment, guns, vehicles and aircraft, and to develop tactical techniques which were later used in the 1939-45 conflict. In addition to a detachment of converted Junkers Ju 52s, a initial cadre of six Heinkel He-51s, were despatched, with enough service staff to instruct the Spanish aircrews in the operation and maintenance of the aircraft. Under the leadership of Leutnant Hannes Trautloft J/88 arrived by sea in August 1936. While the Spanish Air Force pilots trained, Trautloft and the other pilots became the first of an eventual 326 aircrew who would serve with Jagdgruppe 88 during the next two and a half years. Operational history Oberleutnant Eberhardt Kraft made the unit's first claim on 25 August 1936, a Casa-Breguet 19. Meantime aid from the Soviet Union arrived for the Republican forces. The supplied Soviet fighters (Polikarpov I-15 and I-16) easily outperformed the Heinkel He 51s, and in late 1936, three Messerschmitt Bf 109 prototypes were sent to J/88, and soon followed by the first 15 of the latest Bf 109-Bs. A He 112 V6 prototype was also sent. Armed with a single 20mm cannon firing through the airscrew hub, the Kanonenvogel (cannon bird) was to be evaluated as a ground attack aircraft and assigned to Jagdgruppe 88 at Almorox in March. Over the next few months the He 112 V6 was flown by several pilots, but on 19 July 1937, with Unteroffizier Max Schulze flying, the engine seized during landing, and the He 112 V6 broke its back and was written off. Messerschmitt Bf 109 C-1, Jagdgruppe 88, Legion Condor The first unit to fly the Bf 109 was 2. Staffel, commanded by Oberleutnat G√ºnther L√ºtzow. The unit initially suffered several landing accidents, until the pilots became familiar with taking off and landing on the narrow‚Äëtrack undercarriage. The first major action of 2.J/88 with the Bf 109-B1, took place during the Battle of Brunete in July 1937. Based near √Åvila, its main mission was to escort the Junkers Ju 52 bombers. The Bf 109s, utilising superior tactics developed by Leutnant Werner M√∂lders, turned air superiority in favour of the Condor Legion. The Bf 109s drew first blood on 8 July 1937 when Leutnant Rolf Pingel and Uzz. Guido H√∂ness claimed two Tupolev SB‚Äë2 bombers. Air combats fought on 12 July resulted in two Aero A.101s claimed by H√∂ness, an SB‚Äë2 to Pingel, and three I‚Äë16s by Pingel, Fw. Peter Boddem and Fw. Adolf Buhl. H√∂ness became the first Bf 109 loss, probably shot down and killed by an Republican I-16 flown by American Frank Tinker. The Condor Legion lost eight aircraft, but J/88 fighters claimed 18 victories. On 24 July Republican forces launched their final major offensive, the Battle of the Ebro. Reconnaissance aircraft of the Condor Legion noticed the troop build-up, and while the Republic forced gained ground, they failed to take Gandesa, due to intensive ( over 400) sorties by 70 Legion aircraft. The rest of the battle saw a series of air strikes, followed by a Nationalist counter-offensive. During the 113-day battle, only 10 aircraft were lost and 14 damaged; the Legion claimed 100 Republican aircraft destroyed, a third of those lost. Only 5 aircrew had been killed, and 6 captured. Some 19 Bf 109C-1s, with a fuel‚Äëinjected Jumo 210Ga engine and four 7.9mm machine guns, arrived in Spain in the spring 1938, followed by nine Bf 109-Ds in August. In February 1939 the latest Bf 109E‚Äë1 model was sent to Jagdgruppe 88, with 2. Staffel converting from the Bf 109-B in late February 1939, just prior to the end of the War. The unit then took part in operations against the remnants of the Republican Air Force through early 1939, with considerable success. The men of J/88 returned to Germany in May 1939. 365 aircraft were claimed destroyed by Jagdgruppe 88, and 26 pilots claimed 5 kills or more. Werner M√∂lders (14), Wolfgang Schellmann (12), Harro Harder (11) and Peter Boddem (10) were top scorers. Prominent members of J/88 Hauptmann Gotthard Handrick, winner of the modern pentathlon at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, arrived in the summer of 1937 to assume command of Jagdgruppe 88, remaining until September 1938, during which time he had claimed 5 victories. Heinkel He 51 C of the 3./J 88 ‚Äî Adolf Galland ‚Äî Legion Condor Oberleutnant Werner M√∂lders arrived on 14 April 1938, and took over from Adolf Galland commanding 3 staffel. During the conflict he showed considerable qualities as both a pilot and tactician. He helped to develop the \\"finger four\\", formation, which improved a combat flight's all-round effectiveness, vision and flexibility in combat. Between July and November 1938 he shot down fourteen aircraft: eleven I-16s, two Polikarpov I-15s and one SB-2, mostly flying a Bf 109C-1 coded 6-79 \\"Luchs\\". Leutnant Wilhelm Balthasar joined Jagdgruppe 88 in September 1937, and gained six victories, including four Tupolev SB-2 bombers shot down in one mission on 7 February 1938. Oberleutnant Adolf Galland was appointed Staffelkapit√§n of 3. Staffel, in July 1937, eventually flying 200 ground attack missions in the Heinkel He 51.

The county formed part of the Nation‚Äôs Pushmataha District, or Third District, one of three administrative super-regions.  History  The county was named for Jacob Jackson, a prominent Choctaw. It was organized from portions of Blue County, Jack‚Äôs Fork County and Kiamitia County by an Act of the General Council on October 21, 1886.Constitution and Laws of the Choctaw Nation, 1894; ‚ÄúOrganization of Counties in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations,‚Äù Chronicles of Oklahoma, Vol. 8, No. 3, September 1930, p. 332. Jackson County‚Äôs boundaries were established and designated according to easily recognizable natural landmarks, as were the boundaries of all Choctaw Nation counties. Island Bayou, Muddy Boggy Creek, the Blue River, and the Red River, all of which were regionally significant waterways, formed its boundaries. Jackson County was bordered on its east by Kiamitia County and on its west by Blue County. Its county seat was Pigeon Roost, south of present-day Boswell. The county also hosted Mayhew, the capital of the Pushmataha District. Mayhew was located north of present-day Boswell.Angie Debo, The Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, p. 15; ‚ÄúOrganization of Counties in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations,‚Äù Chronicles of Oklahoma, Vol. 8, No. 3, September 1930, p. 332. The county served as an election district for members of the National Council, and as a unit of local administration. Constitutional officers, all of whom served for two-year terms and were elected by the voters, included the county judge, sheriff, and a ranger. The judge‚Äôs duties included oversight of overall county administration. The sheriff collected taxes, monitored unlawful intrusion by intruders (usually white Americans from the United States), and conducted the census. The county ranger advertised and sold strayed livestock.Angie Debo, The Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, p. 152.  Statehood  As Oklahoma‚Äôs statehood approached, its leading citizens, who were gathered for the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention, realized in laying out the future state‚Äôs counties that, while logically designed, the Choctaw Nation‚Äôs counties could not exist as economically viable political subdivisions. In most the county seat existed generally for holding county court and not as a population center. This conundrum was also recognized by the framers of the proposed State of Sequoyah, who met in 1905 to propose statehood for the Indian Territory. The Sequoyah Constitutional Convention also proposed a county structure that abolished the Choctaw counties. Jackson County was divided principally into the proposed Blue County, Tom Needles County, and Hitchcock County. Caddo would have been county seat of Blue; Durant the county seat of Tom Needles; and Hugo the county seat of Hitchcock.Amos Maxwell, Sequoyah Constitutional Convention. Although the map carried in wikipedia‚Äôs article on the State of Sequoyah speaks to the matter of borders, Maxwell's book offers further insight. Much of this proposition was borrowed two years later by Oklahoma‚Äôs framers, who adopted certain of these concepts for the future Bryan County and Choctaw County in Oklahoma. The territory formerly comprising Jackson County, Choctaw Nation now falls primarily within these two counties, with a small portion in Atoka County. Jackson County ceased to exist upon Oklahoma‚Äôs statehood on November 16, 1907.

McNeill, J. R. (2010). Mosquito Empires: Ecology and War in the Greater Caribbean, 1620‚Äì1914 (1st edn, p. 390). Cambridge University Press. Via Amazon. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the virus originated from East or Central Africa, with transmission between primates and humans, and spread from there to West Africa. The virus as well as the vector Aedes aegypti, a mosquito species, were probably brought to the western hemisphere and the Americas by slave trade ships from Africa after the first European exploration in 1492. The first outbreaks of disease that were probably yellow fever occurred in the Windward Islands of the Caribbean, on Barbados in 1647 and Guadeloupe in 1648. Barbados had undergone an ecological transformation with the introduction of sugar cultivation by the Dutch. Plentiful forests present in the 1640s were completely gone by the 1660s. By the early 18th century, the same transformation related to sugar cultivation had occurred on the larger islands of Jamaica, Hispaniola and Cuba. Spanish colonists recorded an outbreak in 1648 on the Yucat√°n Peninsula of Mexico that may have been yellow fever. The illness was called xekik (black vomit) by the Maya. At least 25 major outbreaks followed in North America, such as in 1793 in Philadelphia, where several thousand people died, more than nine percent of the total population. The American government, including George Washington, had to flee the city, which was the capital of the United States at the time. In 1878, about 20,000 people died in an epidemic which struck the towns of the Mississippi River Valley and its tributaries. The last major outbreak in the US occurred in 1905 in New Orleans. Major outbreaks also occurred in Europe in the 19th century in Atlantic ports following the arrival of sailing vessels from the Caribbean, most often from Havana. Outbreaks occurred in Barcelona, Spain, in 1803, 1821, and 1870. In the last outbreak, 1,235 fatalities were recorded of an estimated 12,000 cases. Smaller outbreaks occurred in Saint-Nazaire in France, Swansea in Wales, and in other European port cities, following the arrival of vessels carrying the mosquito vector. The first mention of the disease by the name \\"yellow fever\\" occurred in 1744.The earliest mention of \\"yellow fever\\" appears in a manuscript of 1744 by Dr. John Mitchell of Virginia; copies of the manuscript were sent to Mr. Cadwallader Colden, a physician in New York, and to Dr. Benjamin Rush of Philadelphia; the manuscript was eventually printed (in large part) in 1805 and reprinted in 1814. See: * (John Mitchell) (1805) (Mitchell's account of the Yellow Fever in Virginia in 1741‚Äì2), The Philadelphia Medical Museum, 1 (1) : 1‚Äì20. * (John Mitchell) (1814) \\"Account of the Yellow fever which prevailed in Virginia in the years 1737, 1741, and 1742, in a letter to the late Cadwallader Colden, Esq. of New York, from the late John Mitchell, M.D.F.R.S. of Virginia,\\" American Medical and Philosophical Register, 4 : 181‚Äì215. The term \\"yellow fever\\" appears on p. 186. On p. 188, Mitchell mentions \\"‚Ä¶ the distemper was what is generally called the yellow fever in America.\\" However, on pages 191‚Äì192, he states \\"‚Ä¶ I shall consider the cause of the yellowness which is so remarkable in this distemper, as to have given it the name of the Yellow Fever.\\" Dr. Mitchell misdiagnosed the disease that he observed and treated, and that the disease was probably Weil's disease or hepatitis. See: Many famous people, mostly during the 18th through the 20th centuries, contracted and then recovered from, or died of, yellow fever. Philadelphia: 1793 The Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793 struck during the summer in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where the highest fatalities in the United States were recorded. The disease probably was brought by refugees and mosquitoes on ships from Saint-Domingue. It rapidly spread in the port city, in the crowded blocks along the Delaware River. About 5000 people died, ten percent of the population of 50,000. The city was then the national capital, and the national government left the city, including President George Washington. Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York suffered repeated epidemics in the 18th and 19th centuries, as did other cities along the East and Gulf coasts.Campbell, Ballard C. (ed.), American Disasters: 201 Calamities That Shook the Nation (2008), pp. 49‚Äì50. Haiti: 1790‚Äì1802 The majority of the British soldiers sent to Haiti in the 1790s died of disease, chiefly yellow fever.Marr, John S., and John T. Cathey. \\"The 1802 Saint-Domingue yellow fever epidemic and the Louisiana Purchase.\\" Journal of Public Health Management and Practice 19#.1 (2013): 77‚Äì82. online . Also via: There has been considerable debate over whether the number of deaths caused by disease was exaggerated. In 1802‚Äì1803, an army of forty thousand sent by First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte of France to Saint Domingue to suppress the Haitian Revolution mounted by slaves, was decimated by an epidemic of yellow fever (among the casualties was the expedition's commander and Bonaparte's brother-in-law, Charles Leclerc). Some historians believe Napoleon intended to use the island as a staging point for an invasion of the United States through Louisiana (then newly regained by the French from the Spanish.). Others believe that he was most intent on regaining control of the lucrative sugar production and trade in Saint- Domingue. Only one-third of the French troops survived to return to France, and in 1804 the new republic of Haiti declared its independence. Savannah, Georgia: 1820 Nearly 700 people in Savannah, Georgia, died from yellow fever in 1820, including two local physicians who lost their lives caring for the stricken. An outbreak on an immigrant ship with Irish natives in 1819 led to a passage of an act to prevent the arrival of immigrant ships, which did not prevent the epidemic where 23% of the deaths were of Irish dissent. Several other epidemics followed, including 1854 and 1876. New Orleans, Louisiana: 1853 The 1853 outbreak claimed 7,849 residents of New Orleans. The press and the medical profession did not alert citizens of the outbreak until the middle of July, after more than one thousand people had already died. The New Orleans business community feared that word of an epidemic would cause a quarantine to be placed on the city, and their trade would suffer. In such epidemics, steamboats frequently carried passengers and the disease upriver from New Orleans to other cities along the Mississippi River. The epidemic was dramatized and featured in the plot of the 1938 film Jezebel, starring Bette Davis. Yellow fever was a threat in New Orleans and south Louisiana virtually every year, during the warmest months. Among the more prominent victims were: Spanish colonial Governor Manuel Gayoso de Lemos (1799); the first and second wives (d. 1804 and 1809) of territorial Governor William C. C. Claiborne and his young daughter (1804); one of New Orleans' most important early city planners Barthelemy Lafon (1820), architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe and one of his sons (1820, 1817, respectively), who were in New Orleans building the city's first waterworks; Jesse Burton Harrison (1841), a young lawyer and author; Confederate Brig. Gen. Young Marshall Moody (1866); architect James Gallier, Jr. (1868); and Confederate Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood and his wife and daughter (1879). Norfolk, Virginia: 1855 The Yellow Fever Memorial was built in 1855 in Laurel Hill Cemetery to honor the Philadelphia \\"Doctors, Druggists and Nurses\\" who helped fight the epidemic in Portsmouth, Virginia A ship carrying persons infected with the virus arrived in Hampton Roads in southeastern Virginia in June 1855. (undated newspaper clipping). The disease spread quickly through the community, eventually killing over 3,000 people, mostly residents of Norfolk and Portsmouth. The Howard Association, a benevolent organization, was formed to help coordinate assistance in the form of funds, supplies, and medical professionals and volunteers, who poured in from many other areas, particularly the Atlantic and Gulf Coast areas of the United States.Bluemink DonnaYellow Fever in Norfolk and Portsmouth , Virginia, 1855, as reported in the Daily Dispatch Richmond, Virginia, retrieved 14 March 2019 editor /transcriber http://www.usgwarchives.net/va/yellow- fever//yfinindex.html#generalindexGosport (Norfolk) Naval Hospital patient register for August 1855 & admittance of yellow fever patients, note the high mortality Bermuda: 1843, 1853. 1856, 1864 Bermuda suffered four yellow fever epidemics in the 1800s, both mosquito borne and via visiting ships, and in total claimed the lives of 13,356 people, including Military and civilian population. During the 1864 epidemic, a Dr. Luke Pryor Blackburn, from Halifax, Nova Scotia, visited the island several times, to assist the local medical community on account of his knowledge of the disease, and when he left in October 1864, he left behind some trunks of soiled clothing that were to have been sent to him in Canada. Fortunately the trunks were located and the contents destroyed. It became evident that Dr Blackburn's visits had been financed by the Confederacy, and that a certain Union informer had been offered $60,000 to distribute Dr. Blackburn's trunks of soiled clothing to Union cities including Boston, Philadelphia, Washington and Norfolk. Also one trunk went to New Bern, which was identified as having brought yellow fever to that city, claiming the lives of 2,000 people. Blackburn was arrested and tried, but acquitted owing to lack of evidence, other than hearsay by witnesses, meaning that the culprit trunks could not be located, and in 1878, he went on heroically, to fight yellow fever in Kentucky where he had set up practice in Louisville, and was eventually elected governor of that state. Texas and Louisiana: 1867 The 1867 yellow fever epidemic claimed many casualties in the southern counties of Texas, as well as in New Orleans. The deaths in Texas included Union Maj. Gen. Charles Griffin, Margaret Lea Houston (Mrs. Sam Houston), and at least two young physicians and their family members. Lower Mississippi Valley: 1878 The entire Mississippi River Valley from St. Louis south was affected, and tens of thousands fled the stricken cities of New Orleans, Vicksburg, and Memphis. An estimated 120,000 cases of yellow fever resulted in some 20,000 deaths.Bloom, Khaled J. (1993), The Mississippi Valley's Great Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1878, Louisiana State University Press. It is unknown what exactly led to the outbreak in the Mississippi River Valley as causes range from unchecked vessels from the fruit trade to refugees from the Ten Years' War in Cuba, which was experiencing a rise in yellow fever cases, however, investigations at the time suggest that the epidemic originated from the steamer Emily B. Souder on May 22, 1878. Memphis suffered several epidemics during the 1870s, culminating in the 1878 epidemic (called the Saffron Scourge of 1878), with more than 5,000 fatalities in the city. Some contemporary accounts said that commercial interests had prevented the rapid reporting of the outbreak of the epidemic, increasing the total number of deaths. People still did not understand how the disease developed or was transmitted, and did not know how to prevent it.Crosby, M. C. (2006), The American Plague: The Untold Story of Yellow Fever, the Epidemic That Shaped Our History. The 1878 epidemic was the worst that occurred in the state of Mississippi. Sometimes known as \\"Yellow Jack\\", and \\"Bronze John\\", devastated Mississippi socially and economically. Entire families were killed, while others fled their homes for the presumed safety of other parts of the state. Quarantine regulations, passed to prevent the spread of the disease, brought trade to a stop. Some local economies never recovered. Beechland, near Vicksburg, became a ghost town because of the epidemic. By the end of the year, 3,227 people had died from the disease. The French Panama Canal Effort: 1882‚Äì1889 The French effort to build a Panama Canal was damaged by the prevalence of endemic tropical diseases in the Isthmus. Although malaria was also a serious problem for the French canal builders, the numerous yellow fever fatalities and the fear they engendered made it difficult for the French company to retain sufficient technical staff to sustain the effort. Since the mode of transmission of the disease was unknown, the French response to the disease was limited to care of the sick. The French hospitals contained many pools of stagnant water, such as basins underneath potted plants, in which mosquitoes could breed. The numerous deaths eventually led to the failure of the French company licensed to build the canal, resulting in a massive financial crisis in France.McCullough, David (1978), The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870‚Äì1914, New York: Simon & Schuster (a comprehensive history of the building of the canal).

(foaled in 1974) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse. He was bred in Virginia by Miss Peggy Augustus and raced under the Dana Bray banner as his owner. He finished racing with a record of 7-2-6 in 17 starts with career earnings of $371,256. Johnny D. was best known for his wins in the grade one Washington, D.C. International Stakes and the grade one Turf Classic Invitational Stakes. Although he raced for several years, 1977 is when he won all but his maiden race including his two grade one turf races.Pedigree Online, Thoroughbred Database;. That same year he was named the country's top grass equine by being voted 1977 American Champion Male Turf Horse honors.  Two-year-old career  Johnny D. was a very late developing thoroughbred. As a two-year-old Johnny D. only raced four times, he placed third in twice and won a maiden race that year. He finished the year with an annual record of 1-0-2 in 4 starts.  Three-year-old career  Early in his three-year-old season, Johnny D. had moderate success in competition, but not in stakes races. Following a sixth-place finish on dirt in the Peter Pan Stakes, he was switched from dirt racing to grass racing, and began to improve. He won four turf races in a row, culminating with a victory in July, in the Lexington Handicap, a Grade II race formerly held at Belmont Park for three-year-olds on the turf (not to be confused with the Lexington Stakes, another stakes race for three-year-olds, run at Keeneland in April). After winning an overnight handicap at Saratoga Race Course in August, he returned to Belmont in the fall, running third in the Grade II Lawrence Realization Stakes against three- year-olds, then trying older horses in graded stakes for the first time, in the Grade I Man o' War Stakes, where again he ran third. With the confidence that he could hold his own against older horses on turf, Johnny D. was shipped up to Canada to run in the Canadian International Stakes, a prestigious Grade I race run at Woodbine Racecourse in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. There, he ran third to future National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame inductee Exceller. In November, he was sent to another prestigious international stakes race, the D.C. International at Laurel Park. Facing another top international field of grass horses, he was sent off at 10-1. The French import Crow took the early lead in the mile and a half race, but entering the backstretch, Johnny D. surged to the front, opening up a lead on the field by as many as ten lengths, before easing up towards the finish and defeating Majestic Light and Exceller over a soft turf course. In his final start of 1977, Johnny D. returned to New York for a start in the inaugural Aqueduct Turf Classic Invitational Stakes, as it was known then before being renamed for famed turf writer Joe Hirsch in 2004. Facing Majestic Light, Exceller and Crow, among other entrants, once more Johnny D. went to the front, but faced a stiffer challenge from Majestic Light this time. The two horses dueled throughout the final half of the race, before Johnny D. pulled clear in the last quarter-mile, winning by almost 4 lengths. His jockey for these later races was Steve Cauthen, who would become better known in 1978 for being the jockey of Triple Crown champion Affirmed. For his grass racing successes that fall, Johnny D. was named Champion Male Turf Horse at the Eclipse Awards.  Later career  After his three-year-old campaign came to an end in 1977, Johnny D. suffered a string of injuries that proved difficult to overcome. Every time he seemed ready to return to the races, there would be a setback, causing him to be kept out of action for what eventually turned into a 45-month layoff. \\"But I knew he had the talent and great heart\\" to return to racing, said Dana S. Bray, his owner. Finally, on August 3, 1981, Johnny D. returned to the track at Saratoga, for his first race since his win in the 1977 Aqueduct Turf Classic. Now trained by Laz Barrera, Johnny D. was off slow in his return, made up ground on the backstretch, then tired and faded to last of nine horses. Following that effort, Johnny D. was retired from racing.http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Horse&refno;=587018&registry;=T References Category:1974 racehorse births Category:Thoroughbred family 9 Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States ","title":"Johnny D."},{"id":"24949137","text":"Directly Operated Railways Ltd.

Counties While Rhode Island is subdivided geographically into five counties, county government was abolished in the state in 1842. Since that time, counties in Rhode Island have had no associated governmental structures. All local government in the state is vested in its 39 municipalities. Counties are still generally used as both geographic regions and also as judicial districts. Cities and towns The primary political subdivisions of Rhode Island are its cities and towns. New England towns are conceptually similar to civil townships in that the entire territory of the state is completely covered by them. However, they differ primarily in that New England towns have broad home rule and have powers comparable to those that a city in other states would normally have. In addition, cities and towns in Rhode Island also perform functions commonly assigned to counties in other states. Rhode Island state law does not distinguish between a city and a town. Cities are simply municipalities that acquired their charter through a special act of the Rhode Island General Assembly. Any municipality (whether a city or a town) is free to adopt whatever form of government they choose.  Powers of cities and towns  * Exercising police power * Imposing property taxes on its residents * Borrowing money and issuing tax-exempt bonds * Acquiring, possessing, and expending the revenue * Hiring and firing personnel * Entering into contracts * Initiating lawsuits * Enacting ordinances * Enforcing zoning regulations * Eminent domain School districts With a few exceptions, the city and town governments of Rhode Island are generally responsible for education management within their jurisdiction. Twenty-nine of the thirty-nine cities/towns manage their own school systems from pre-kindergarten to high school. One city, Central Falls, is governed by a board appointed by the state board of regents. Two towns, Glocester and Foster, manage schools only through elementary school. The other seven towns, which are more rural, have joined together to form regional school districts to manage their entire school system, namely, Bristol-Warren, Exeter-West Greenwich, and Charlestown-Richmond-Hopkinton. For the purposes of managing their common middle school and high school, the Foster-Glocester Regional School District has also been established. Legislative districts The Rhode Island General Assembly consists of a Senate and a House of Representatives. The state is divided into thirty-eight senatorial districts and seventy- five representative districts. Both sets of districts are set up such that each is roughly equal in population. Judicial districts Rhode Island is divided into four judicial districts that correspond to county groupings of towns, with the exception of Bristol County, which is part of the jurisdiction associated with Providence County.  Special districts and agencies  Rhode Island has 91 special-purpose districts that have been established throughout the state for various purposes. Most such districts in the state, including fire, water, lighting, street maintenance, garbage removal, and utility districts are established by a special act of the General Assembly. There are also two county-wide water authorities (Bristol and Kent). The cities of Providence and East Providence also have urban development commissions. The Capital Center Commission in Providence manages parking, transportation, and streetscaping in downtown Providence. The East Providence Special Development District Commission manages development in the waterfront area of the city.

This concentration was primarily due to IAPMO members‚Äô expertise from more than 50 years of writing and updating the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC). Recently, IAPMO's efforts have broadened to include standards for mechanical products. Drawing on their years of experience, many IAPMO members have also contributed to the development of the Uniform Mechanical Code (UMC). Mechanical product standards cover heating, ventilation, cooling and refrigeration system products. IAPMO also publishes standards covering products used in the Recreational Vehicle and Manufactured Housing Industry called IAPMO Trailer Standards. The IAPMO Standards Department represents IAPMO in many standards-writing organizations throughout North America. These organizations include the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American Society of Sanitary Engineering (ASSE), the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) and the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA). The IAPMO Standards Department is also involved in its own standards work. IAPMO publishes more than 200 current standards. These standards have been developed through IAPMO's standards development process. Many IAPMO standards have been developed into nationally recognized consensus standards in conjunction with organizations such as ANSI, ASME, ASSE and ASTM. The IAPMO Standards Department is also an ANSI-accredited Standard Development Organization (SDO), which develops and publishes IAPMO/ANSI consensus standards such as the Z124 documents for plastic plumbing products and the Z1000 series documents for waste disposal products. IAPMO Guide Criteria The IAPMO Standards Department works with industry to provide an opportunity for the development of new standards when no applicable standard exists for a product. Often, new products or technologies surge ahead far faster than many standards can keep pace. Through the IAPMO Guide Criteria (IGC) procedure, IAPMO provides manufacturers and product developers an opportunity to draft IAPMO standards as a vehicle for introducing new products. Once an IGC is accepted, IAPMO R&T; can list products manufactured in compliance with the new requirements. IAPMO Standards Review Committee The IAPMO Standards Review Committee meets monthly to review all proposed new standards and standards changes submitted to IAPMO. These meetings are open to members of industry and the public at large. All sides have the opportunity to present their views and supporting information on the proposals discussed at these meetings. Proposals voted on by the Standards Review Committee are posted for 20 days on the IAPMO Standards Development Program 20 Day Public Review Website for public comment. Revising or Developing IAPMO Standards Proposals may be submitted to IAPMO's Standards Department for revisions to existing IAPMO Standards or to develop new standards if no applicable standard exists for a product. Applications and fee schedules are available at iapmostandards.org. Proposals and Applications must be submitted before the 26th of the month and will be reviewed by the Standards Review Committee (SRC) at the following monthly meeting.

Between 1709 and 1715, a wooden church was built on the site of the present church, but no details are known about this building. A Swedish Lutheran Reverend, Jonas Auren who had come to America in the late 1600s, preached here for a congregation made of Swedes and Finns from the former colony of New Sweden, as well as English colonists, until his death in 1713. During this time the church was known as St. Mary‚Äôs parish. In 1714, Queen Anne of England died. In an effort to establish the Anglican Church in the colonies she bequeathed a large Bible, a Book of Common Prayer and a silver chalice and paten to the congregation.

History Needmore was so named because townsite promoters ‚Äúneeded more‚Äù settlers. Others contend that the town was named as an act of desperation to get the attention of more resource-rich cities in the region, including Notrees and Whiteface, to provide help in sustaining the town while in its infancy. After the town's founding in the 1920s, it never grew significantly, and by 1940, only 20 residents and two stores were at the site. By 1980, the population had reached 98, where it remained in 1990 and then dropped to 45 by 2000. Geography In the state of Texas, four small communities share the name Needmore, and the high plains area of the Llano Estacado has two. Needmore (Terry County) is located about to the southeast of Needmore (Bailey County). Both are rural agricultural communities with cotton gins. Needmore (Bailey County) is located slightly east of the center of the county, around south of Muleshoe, the county seat, and north of the Muleshoe National Wildlife Refuge. It is located at the intersection of Texas State Highway 214 and Farm Road 298 between the small communities of Baileyboro to the west and Circle Back to the east. The terrain surrounding Needmore consists of level plains that at one time were covered with grassland vegetation. Today, with the exception of the Muleshoe National Wildlife Refuge, the shortgrass prairie has been replaced by plowed cropland, where cotton, sorghum, and winter wheat are grown. To the south and west of Needmore are numerous shallow lakes called ‚Äúplayas‚Äù. Most of these hold water for a short time after rain then dry and remain dry for extended periods. Some of the larger saline playas provide important refuge for migratory waterfowl flying between Canada and Mexico, such as tens of thousands of sandhill cranes.

MCA Records, 296 F.3d 894 (9th Cir. 2002), was a series of lawsuits between Mattel and MCA Records that resulted from the 1997 Aqua song, \\"Barbie Girl\\". The case was ultimately dismissed. Background On December 5th 2000, Mattel sued MCA Records, the recording company of Aqua, saying the song violated the Barbie trademark and turned Barbie into a sex object, referring to her as a \\"Blonde Bimbo.\\" They alleged the song had violated their copyrights and trademarks of Barbie, and that its lyrics had tarnished the reputation of their trademark and impinged on their marketing plan. Mattel also claimed that the cover packaging of the single used \\"Barbie pink\\", a trademarked color owned by Mattel. MCA contested Mattel's claims and countersued for defamation after Mattel had likened MCA to a bank robber. The lawsuit filed by Mattel was dismissed by the lower courts, and this dismissal was upheld. Mattel requested review by the Supreme Court of the United States, but its petition for certiorari was denied.Mattel Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc., no. 02-633, U.S. Supreme Court (Jan. 27, 2003)(order) In 2002, Judge Alex Kozinski ruled the song was protected as a parody under the trademark doctrine of nominative use and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. He also threw out the defamation lawsuit that Aqua's record company filed against Mattel. Kozinski concluded his ruling by saying, \\"The parties are advised to chill.\\" Response This controversy was used by journalist Naomi Klein to make a political point in her book No Logo, where she stated that the monopolies created by copyrights and trademarks are unfairly and differently enforced based on the legal budgets of the conflicting parties and their ability to defend their expressions by hiring lawyers. Judge Alex Kozinski, writing for the panel, opened the opinion by saying: > If this were a sci-fi melodrama, it might be called Speech-Zilla meets > Trademark Kong. Mattel has since released a promotional music video of the song (with modified lyrics) on the official Barbie web site in 2009, as part of a marketing strategy introduced to revive sales.

The NBJHL was in competition for the Callaghan Cup and Centennial Cup as a Junior A league. History Possibly founded in 1969, the NBJHL was the premier Jr. A league of the province of New Brunswick. In 1970, the league was relegated to Tier II Junior A and competition for the Centennial Cup. In 1982-83, the league was in direct competition for fans with the American Hockey League, who put two of their Semi-Professional teams in the NBJHL's Jr. A markets. In 1983, the Fredericton Red Wings folded, leaving the Moncton Hawks as the only strong team in the league. Instead of continuing on in the depleted NBJHL, the Hawks elected to move to Nova Scotia's Jr. A league, the Metro Valley Junior Hockey League, leaving the NBJHL to fold.

Soul by Soul His first book, Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market was published by Harvard University Press in 1999. The book won several prizes: the American Studies Association‚Äôs John Hope Franklin Prize; the Organization of American Historians‚Äô Frederick Jackson Turner and Avery O. Craven Prizes; the Southern Historical Association‚Äôs Francis B. Simkins Prize; the Society of Historians of the Early American Republic‚Äôs SHEAR Book Prize; and the Thomas J. Wilson Prize from Harvard University Press. It was also a selection of the History Book Club. Johnson based Soul by Soul upon the records of the Louisiana Supreme Court, the nineteenth-century narratives of former slaves, slaveholders‚Äô personal records, and the economic documentation produced by the trade itself. He developed the book over years, beginning with ideas he explored first in a seminar on Southern History taught by Nell Irvin Painter. He enlarged that through research and made it the topic of his 1995 Princeton Ph.D. dissertation. In this book, Johnson took up and engaged with many of the themes which had occupied historians of slavery in the thirty years before it was published. The book was among the first in the historiography of slavery in the United States to place the question of capitalism and the market at the heart of its investigation of slavery. By demonstrating the extent to which slaveholders' identities were embodied in their slaves, it also explored the master-slave dialectic and the relationship between slaveholding households and the slave market. By following slaves‚Äô efforts to forge human connections amidst the violent dislocation of the slave trade, it provided an account of the ability of \\"the slave community\\" to reproduce itself over time and space. It explored slaveholders' gendered fantasies about the slave market, describing the questions they asked and the examinations they made in the slave market. In this way, it investigated the daily reproduction of racist ideas about medicine, management, and sexuality in the institution that was at the heart of the slaveholding economy. By recovering traces of slaves' efforts to shape their own sales, it altered the central symbol of slavery's brutality by placing it in a history of opposition, resistance, and manipulation. In noting the vulnerability of slaveholders' identities, which were dependent upon slaves for their performance, Johnson sought to explain the extraordinary violence that characterized all of antebellum slavery. Articles Johnson published an article titled \\"On Agency\\" in the Journal of Social History in 2003. It is a historiographical and theoretical consideration of the notion of \\"agency\\" central to a large body of scholarship in the Humanities and Social Sciences. It is not, as it is sometimes understood to be, a blanket condemnation of the writing of \\"history from the bottom up,\\" but rather a call for a more critical attention to the terms in which that history is written. ‚ÄúAgency,‚Äù Johnson argues, has come to aggregate too many different sorts of actions under one heading, thus losing the ability to distinguish between different sorts of material contexts, cultural framings, and political purposes. \\"On Agency,\\" is a critique of the crypto-liberal philosophical premises of progressive historiography, and a call for what the historian Richard White termed a more \\"radical\\" approach to the writing of history. Johnson's article \\"The Pedestal and the Veil\\" was published in the Journal of the Early Republic in 2004. The piece develops a consideration of Marx's treatment of cotton and slavery in the first volume of Capital into a critique of the orthodox analytical separation of ‚Äúslavery‚Äù and ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù into separate stages of economic development. The piece suggests that, while the nineteenth century developed a hard-and-fast ideological distinction between the two which has made its way into the work of many subsequent historians, in historical fact slavery and industry were so deeply intertwined that they should be considered as differentiated aspects of a single economic system. River of Dark Dreams River of Dark Dreams: Slavery and Empire in the Cotton Kingdom was published by Harvard University Press in 2013. In it, Johnson seeks to empirically substantiate some of the conceptual arguments made in his articles from the preceding decade, as well as to resituate the historiography of nineteenth-century slavery in the history of the global economy of the nineteenth century. Where much of Johnson's earlier work had been framed around the consideration of various notions of historical time, River of Dark Dreams is a book about space: the material space of the landscape of the cotton South, the economic space of the Atlantic World, and the imagined space of white supremacy and pro-slavery imperialism. River of Dark Dreams: Slavery and Empire in the Cotton Kingdom (2013) won the 2013 SHEAR Book Prize and received an Honorable Mention for the 2014 Avery O. Craven Prize from the Organization of American Historians. It was also a Choice Outstanding Academic Title for 2013. The \\"New History of Capitalism\\" and \\"Racial Capitalism\\" While Johnson's work is often described as an example of the \\"New History of Capitalism,\\" Johnson himself rejects that label. He emphasizes his indebtedness to a historiographical tradition dating back to W. E. B. Du Bois's 1899 The Suppression of the African Slavery Trade to the United States of America and, especially, Du Bois's 1935 Black Reconstruction, and especially to Du Bois's emphasis on the ineluctably racial character of capitalism, and on the experience and historical action of working people, especially African American working people. Among his principal scholarly influences, Johnson cites Du Bois, Cedric Robinson, Nell Irvin Painter, Robin D. G. Kelley, David Roediger, George Lipsitz, Daniel Rodgers, Richard White, Lisa Lowe, Adam Green, and Stephanie Smallwood. Writing at length in the Boston Review, Johnson has recently invoked the models of Du Bois and Cedric Robinson in proposing that the historiography of slavery be reframed around the idea of \\"racial capitalism.\\" Controversy Johnson's River of Dark Dreams has recently drawn critical attention from economic historians who grouped his study alongside several other scholars' books. Empirical errors found in these books suggest that the ‚ÄúNew History of Capitalism‚Äù has paid insufficient attention to economics.http://www.chronicle.com/article/ShacklesDollars/238598 While acknowledging that River of Dark Dreams misstates the Latin name of Upland Cotton and, for certain scholars, may provide a mathematically incorrect account of the way that slaveholders calculated the productivity of their land and their slaves, Johnson has nevertheless maintained that errors in applying an empirical framework do not substantially or even meaningfully alter the book's interpretation of the social and economic history of cotton and slavery. Awards Professor Johnson has received numerous awards and honors, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, fellowships from the American Philosophical Society, the Radcliffe Institute, and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, an ACLS-Burkhardt Fellowship, and a Mellon Fellowship in Cultural Studies at Wesleyan University.

He was captain of the tennis and lacrosse teams at Princeton High School, and went on to receive a bachelor's degree in economics from Middlebury College, and an MBA from New York University Stern School of Business. His mother, S. Ruth Schulman, was associate dean of Rutgers' Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology (GSAPP) from 1974 to 1999. His father, Mel Schulman, was a chemical engineer. Schulman once told The New York Times, \\"I was born with social activism in my DNA. My grandfather was a union organizer in the garment district in New York City. My mother took me to a civil rights demonstration in Washington in my stroller.\\" Business background Schulman began his business career at AT&T;, working more than 18 years there and becoming the youngest member of the company's senior executive team. Schulman started at an entry-level account management position; when he left AT&T;, he was president of the $22 billion consumer long distance business, managing 40,000 employees. He then became president and COO, and then CEO of Priceline.com. During his two years there, Priceline's annual revenues grew from a reported $20 million to about $1 billion. In 2001, Richard Branson invited Schulman to become the founding CEO of Virgin Mobile USA, Inc. Schulman led the company from its national launch in 2002 to it becoming a public company in 2007, and ultimately its sale to Sprint Nextel in 2009. His tenure at the company was noted by the company's growth as the \\"no hidden fees\\" carrier. By the time Schulman left Virgin Mobile, it had become one of the nation's top wireless carriers, with more than 5 million customers and $1.3 billion in annual sales. Following the sale of Virgin Mobile to Sprint Nextel, Schulman served as President of Sprint's Prepaid group until he moved to American Express. On September 30, 2014, it was announced that Schulman would become CEO of PayPal, which would continue as a separate legal entity, split from eBay in 2015. His tenure was also marked by the $2.2 billion acquisition of European payment provider iZettle, PayPal's second largest purchase to date. He has stated that his goals at PayPal include giving financial tools to the 70 million Americans underserved by the U.S. financial system. During the 2018‚Äì19 United States federal government shutdown, Schulman initiated the idea for PayPal to offer $500 in interest- free cash advances to furloughed U.S. government workers, committing to provide up to $25 million in interest-free loans. In April 2019, Schulman announced PayPal's plans to invest $500 million in Uber to connect the two marketplaces. Board service Schulman became chairman of Symantec (SYMC- NASDAQ) in January 2013. In September 2018, he was elected as a member of the Verizon Board of Directors. Schulman also served on the advisory committee of Greycroft Partners, a private equity company focused on early-stage new media and technology companies. Schulman was on the Board of Governors of Rutgers University from April 2008 to June 2013. He also serves on the board at Autism Speaks, an advocacy group dedicated to advancing research into causes and treatments for individuals on the autism spectrum. Politics Schulman denounced the North Carolina Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act that mandated people in public facilities use bathrooms in accordance to their gender at birth. He stated that \\"The new law perpetuates discrimination and it violates the values and principles that are at the core of PayPal's mission and culture.\\" Schulman also cosigned an opposition letter with about 120 executives from major corporations. In protest at the new law in North Carolina, Schulman announced that the company was canceling its expansion to hire 400 people in the state. Dan Schulman wrote in the PayPal statement, \\"While we will seek an alternative location for our operations center, we remain committed to working with the LGBT community in North Carolina to overturn this discriminatory legislation, alongside all those who are committed to equality.\\" Awards Schulman was named by Business Week as one of the top 20 people to watch in media, and was named the Ernst & Young 2009 Entrepreneur of the Year. In 2009 he was named one of the top 25 most powerful people in the global wireless industry. In 2017, the Council for Economic Education honored Schulman with its Visionary Award for promoting economic and financial literacy to create a better informed society. Fortune included him in the top ten in its 2017 Businessperson of the Year list, and in its 2018 list. In 2017, Schulman was recognized by the Brennan Center for Justice with its Brennan Legacy Award, named after the Supreme Court justice, for his contributions to democratize financial services and build a more inclusive global economy. In 2018, the Center for Financial Services Innovation awarded Schulman the first-ever CFSI Financial Health Visionary Award for his contributions to a \\"more accessible and inclusive\\" financial system. In 2018, Rutgers University awarded him an honorary doctorate, and he delivered the University's 252nd anniversary commencement speech. Personal life Schulman is married to Jennie, daughter of Dr. Arnold Howard Kassanoff, a physician, and Dorothy Jane Spitzberg. They have a son and a daughter. When he was CEO of Virgin Mobile, Schulman led a partnership with StandUp For Kids, a nonprofit that distributes survival kits and a hotline number to homeless youth. To get a truer sense of what homeless kids experience, Schulman once spent 24 hours on the streets of New York City, unshaven, wrapped in a blanket, and without money, a watch, or a cell phone. \\"There's a certain amount of deference paid to a C.E.O.,\\" he later said. \\"No one paid attention to me on the street. I consider myself a good communicator and a good salesman. It took me five hours of begging to raise less than a dollar. My entire concept of what is important changed. Time is usually my most valuable commodity, but for that 24 hours I had too much time. Forget Starbucks and a $4 latte ‚Äì I walked two miles to find a 25-cent cup of coffee.\\" Schulman has practiced Krav Maga since his teens has stated that he adheres the same philosophy in business. He said in an interview, \\"there‚Äôs a philosophy in martial arts which is, 'Never stand still.' Standing still is asking to be hit. You always have to be willing to take some risks going forward. You can‚Äôt stand still\\". He has been a resident of Warren Township, New Jersey.\\"Daniel H.

Abbas bin Abd ar- Rahman was a scholar who descended from Imam al-Mutawakkil Isma'il (d. 1676) in the sixth generation.R.W. Stookey, Yemen; The Politics of the Yemen Arab Republic.

After the abortive Ottoman intervention in highland Yemen in 1849, the remains of the Zaidi state became the prey of political rivalries. The current imam al-Mansur Ali II was an alcoholic and commanded little respect; tribal groups rebelled, and the court in San'a was dominated by the oppressive minister al-Misri. Certain Sayyids and qadis in San'a defected to Sa'dah far to the north, where al-Mansur Ahmad bin Hashim posed as imam. Al-Mansur Ahmad besieged San'a in 1850. However, the elite of San'a chose Abbas as their imam, under the name al-Mu'ayyad Abbas (June 1850). The new imam appointed Muhammad ash-Shawkani's son Ahmad as his qadi. His soldiers and emirs held out for a while against the attackers in the qasr (fortress) of the city. Finally he had to surrender to al-Mansur Ahmad and was imprisoned. The victor, however, could only maintain his position in San'a for three months before he was forced to flee to the Arhab tribe.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City.

Proprietary estoppel is a legal claim, especially connected to English land law, which may arise in relation to rights to use the property of the owner, and may even be effective in connection with disputed transfers of ownership. Proprietary estoppel transfers rights if, *someone is given a clear assurance that they will acquire a right over property, *they reasonably rely on the assurance, and, *they act substantially to their detriment on the strength of the assurance *it would be unconscionable to go back on the assurance If these elements of assurance, reliance and detriment, and unconscionability are present, the usual remedy will be that the property will be transferred to the claimant, if the court views the reliance to warrant a claim in all the circumstances. History In 1862, in Dillwyn v Llewelyn, a son was held to have acquired a house from his father because he was given a written notice that he would, despite never having completed a deed for conveyance, after the son spent time and money improving the property.Dillwyn v Llewelyn (1862) 4 De GF&J; 517 In Willmott v Barber(1880) 15 Ch D 96 Fry J considered that five elements had to be established before proprietary estoppel could operate:See also Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 * the claimant must have made a mistake as to his legal rights; * the claimant must have done some act of reliance; * the defendant, the possessor of a legal right, must know of the existence of his own right which is inconsistent with the right claimed by the claimant; * the defendant must know of the claimant's mistaken belief; and * the defendant must have encouraged the claimant in his act of reliance. These elements were, however, refined by future case law over the later 20th century and in the early 21st century. Indeed, the High Court in Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher,. recognised that both the principles of proprietary and promissory estoppel encompass the broader principle of equitable estoppel.Silovi Pty Ltd v Barbaro (1988) 13 NSWLR 466, 472. LawCite records Acquisition of rights Proprietary estoppel is one of four principal mechanisms to acquire rights over property, seen particularly in the case of land (the others being a contract, an implied trust, and adverse possession). Unlike a contract or gift, which depend on consent, or resulting and constructive trusts that depend primarily on the fact of contribution, a proprietary estoppel arises when a person has been given a clear assurance, it was reasonable of them to rely on the assurance, and they have acted to their detriment. This threefold pattern of proprietary estoppel (clear assurance, reasonable reliance and substantial detriment) makes it consistent with its partner in the law of obligations, \\"promissory estoppel\\". Although English law has not yet recognised promissory estoppel as giving rise to a cause of action, (as has been done under the American Restatement (Second) of Contracts ¬ß90 and by the Australian High Court in Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher ) in Cobbe v Yeoman's Row Management Ltd Lord Scott remarked that proprietary estoppel should be seen as a sub-species of promissory estoppel. In all cases it allows people who act on others' assurances about legal rights, even without them attaining express agreement. For example, in Crabb v Arun District Council a farmer acquired the right to a path over the council's land, because they had assured him that if he sold off one portion an access point would remain.. In all cases, the minimum pattern of an assurance, reliance and some form of detriment is present. The High Court also recently confirmed that the onus of proof in relation to detrimental reliance cannot be shifted to the estopped party.. Reliance Proprietary estoppel case law has, however, divided on the question of what kind of assurance and what kind of reliance must be present. In Cobbe v Yeoman's Row Management Ltd, a property developer claimed an interest in a group of Knightsbridge flats after his expense in obtaining council planning permission. Mr Cobbe had made an oral agreement with the flat owner, Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring, to get the flats at ¬£12m, but once permission was obtained, the owner broke her oral promise. Even so, in the House of Lords Mr Cobbe failed in his claim for anything more than the expense (¬£150,000) of getting the planning, because in this commercial context it was clear that formal deeds were needed for completion of any deal. By contrast, in Thorner v Major, David (a second cousin) worked on Peter's farm for 30 years and believed he would inherit it.. This probably was intended but after Peter fell out with other relatives, he destroyed his will, leaving David with nothing. Even though no specific assurance, and only some vague conduct indicating an assurance, was present, the House of Lords held that David had a good proprietary estoppel claim. Lord Hoffmann remarked that if a reasonable person could understand, however oblique and allusive, that an assurance was given, a legal right would accrue. The tendency of the cases is therefore to recognise claims more in the domestic context, in which less formal assurances are common, and less in the commercial context, where formality is normal.cf Taylor Fashions and Old & Campbell v Liverpool Victoria Trustees [1982] QB 133, where one business (Taylor) lost against a department store for a lease renewal because it would have improved premises anyway, but another (Old's) succeeded because it was specifically encouraged to make improvements. Remedial flexibility A difficult issue, however, in awarding a remedy for estoppel is that unlike a contract it is not always apparent that a claimant should receive the full measure of what they had expected. By contrast, the factual pattern of estoppels, which often appear something very close to a contract, often seem to warrant more than an award for damages to compensate claimants for the amount of detriment, or loss, as in a tort case. In Jennings v Rice, Robert Walker LJ tackled the issue by emphasising that the purpose of the court's jurisdiction was to avoid an unconscionable result, and to ensure that a remedy was based on proportionality.See also . Here, Mr Jennings had worked as a gardener for a Mrs Royle since the 1970s, but the administrator of her estate had no will. Mr Jennings had been told he \\"would be alright\\" and more so that \\"this will all be yours one day\\". The Court of Appeal resolved, however, that not the full estate, worth ¬£1.285m, but only ¬£200,000 would be awarded in view of the actual detriment incurred by Mr Jennings and the uncertainty of what his assurances really meant. In relation to third parties, the remedy for proprietary estoppel has been confirmed to bind others by the Land Registration Act 2002 section 116. In Giumelli v Giumelli, notwithstanding The High Court of Australia held that the requirements of proprietary estoppel had been established. The plaintiff was not awarded a proprietary interest in the land. Instead, monetary compensation was ordered by the Court in taking into account of other factors, such as other family members had worked and lived the land.. Outside English law The term \\"proprietary estoppel\\" is not used in American law, but is part and parcel of the general doctrine of promissory estoppel. In English law, proprietary estoppel is distinct from promissory estoppel.
