(1994). Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 369. The clan is recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms but as it does not currently have a clan chief it is therefore considered an armigerous clan. History =Origins of the Clan= The name 'Calder' is thought to come from the early Common Brittonic, meaning 'hard or violent water' (the modern Welsh word for hard is \\"caled\\"), or possibly 'stony river'. It is found as a place name throughout Scotland. For example, East Calder and West Calder that are both near Edinburgh, and also Calderwood near Glasgow. Historian William Anderson asserted that the name came to prominence in Scotland through a French knight called Hugo de Cadella, who was created Thane of Calder, later known as Cawdor. The historian George Fraser Black lists Hugo de Kaledouer as a witness to a charter of land near Montrose in around 1178. However, the name arose around Inverness where the Calders were great nobles with considerable lands from the fourteenth century onwards. The third Calder, Thane of Cawdor was however murdered by Sir Alexander Rait of nearby Rait Castle. =15th and 16th centuries= The substantial tower that stands at the heart of Cawdor Castle was built by the Calders in about 1454. The Calders inter-married with other local families such as the powerful chiefs of Clan Rose, Barons of Kilravock. The Calder's ascendency however came to an end when Archibald Campbell, 2nd Earl of Argyll and chief of Clan Campbell was, along with Hugh Rose of Kilravock, appointed guardian to the infant Muriel Calder who was the female heir to the Calder family. Campbell was determined to remove the child to Inveraray so that she could be educated as part of his family. However, he was opposed by Murial's uncles, Alexander and Hugh Calder, who pursued the child and her Campbell escort into Strathnairn. The girl was safely delivered to Inverary but not without considerable loss of life: Campbell of Inverliver who led the kidnapping lost all six of his sons in the fighting as the Calders gave chase to recover the girl.Coventry, Martin. (2008). Castles of the Clans: The Strongholds and Seats of 750 Scottish Families and Clans. pp. 72 - 73. . Murial was the last of the Calder chief's family in the direct line. She was brought up as a Campbell and married Sir John Campbell, son of the Earl of Argyll. Murial died in about 1575 but her descendant, John Campbell of Cawdor, was raised to the peerage as Lord Cawdor in 1796, and his son was created the first Earl Cawdor in 1827. The present Earl Cawdor still lives in Cawdor Castle, seat of his Calder ancestors. The name of Calder did not disappear and the Calders of Asswanly received lands near Elgin in 1440. In 1686 this family obtained a baronetcy of Nova Scotia. The most notable member of this branch of the clan was Robert Calder who saw substantial service in the Napoleonic Wars. =Modern history= During World War II Sir James Calder was an advisor to the Ministry of Supply. Calders are still found around Inverness today, for example Douglas Calder was President of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland and was also appointed director of planning for the newly created Highland Region in 1974. Castles Cawdor Castle, historic seat of the chiefs of Clan Calder. *Cawdor Castle, five miles south-west of Nairn. Much of the present castle was built by the Calders, with a large keep of four storeys that dates from the fourteenth century, and a courtyard enclosing ranges of buildings. The castle is reached by a drawbridge across a ditch. *Nairn Castle dated from the twelfth century and was built by William the Lion. The keepers of the castle were the Calders as Thanes of Cawdor. The castle is another traditional place where Duncan was killed by Macbeth. *Asloun Castle, two miles south-west of Alford, Aberdeenshire, was a Z-plan tower house of the sixteenth century but little remains. It was held by the Calders before passing to the Clan Forbes. *Aswanley House, seven miles west of Huntly, was held by the Calders from 1440 and was sold in 1768 to the Duffs of Braco because of debt.

Its studios are located in the SoMa district of San Francisco, and the transmitter is located on Blackberry Hill above Los Gatos. KUFX is owned by Bonneville International. It was previously operated by Entercom; as part of its merger with CBS Radio, the company was required to divest four of its radio stations in San Francisco in order stay within ownership caps. KUFX was placed in a trust and its operations taken over by Bonneville under a local marketing agreement; the company acquired the station in 2018. On January 24, 2011, KUFX began simulcasting on KUZX 102.1 MHz in San Francisco. This simulcast switched to 102.1-HD2 on August 1, 2014; 102.1 now broadcasts as KRBQ. HD Radio Guide for San Jose History KUFX was originally located at 94.5 FM, then 104.9 FM, and moved to 98.5 FM on June 19, 1998.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-06-26.pdf Before this, the 98.5 frequency was the longtime home to KOME, which is best remembered as a major Bay Area AOR station throughout the 1970s and into the 1990s. Several of the KUFX staff were employed by KOME. KUFX refers to itself as \\"98.5 KFOX\\". KUFX is the official radio station for the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League. In a 2006 column, a writer for the San Jose Mercury News noted that he could only listen to a broadcast of a Stanley Cup playoff game on KUFX since his cable company did not carry OLN (later Versus, now NBC Sports Network), which had exclusive television rights to the game. That situation, he noted, provided an ironic twist to him living in the technology-rich Silicon Valley. The morning show was hosted by Greg Kihn, a musician who had a few Top 40 hit songs in the 1980s, until September 14, 2012. KFOX also holds a Last Band Standing competition every year, between bands that play classic rock cover songs. The three categories of competition include Cover Bands, Tribute Bands, and Under 18 Bands. The past overall winners are Aja Vu in 2004 (A Steely Dan tribute band and two-time winner of its category), The Strobe in 2005 (An Under 18 band from Leigh High School who specializes with Peter Frampton songs), and last years winner, Sage (a cover band). In June 1997, KUFX, KBAY, and KBRG were involved in a three-way frequency swap, which saw KUFX moving from 94.5 to 104.9, and later to 98.5 FM. KBAY moved to 94.5, and KBRG got the coveted 100.3 signal and studios. 104.9 eventually became KCNL. Owner Clear Channel Communications placed the station's assets, along with those of KSJO and KCNL, into an entity called the Aloha Station Trust on August 4, 2008 in order to seek a buyer for the station. This was due to Clear Channel being above the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ownership limits. These limits were imposed when Clear Channel was officially taken private by Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners on July 30, 2008. 102.1 from 2011-2014 On January 11, 2011, Entercom Communications agreed to purchase KUFX, and on January 18, Entercom announced an agreement for the call sign and intellectual property of the company's KDFC-FM in San Francisco and their classical music programming (but not the frequency) to be acquired by the University of Southern California's Classical Public Radio Network. That move allowed them to simulcast KUFX's programming on the 102.1 MHz frequency, as KUFX's main signal on 98.5 only provides grade B coverage of San Francisco. This simulcast switched to 102.1-HD2 on August 1, 2014, when KUZX flipped to Rhythmic AC as KRBQ. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced that it would merge with Entercom. To comply with FCC ownership limits, it was announced that KUFX, along with sister stations KBLX and KOIT, CBS-owned KMVQ, and a cluster in Sacramento, would be divested. Under a local marketing agreement, Bonneville assumed operations of the stations following the completion of the merger on November 17. On August 3, 2018, Bonneville announced that it would acquire all of the divested Entercom stations it had been operating for $141 million; the sale was completed on September 21, 2018.

In 2004, the commemoration ceremony for the holiday was held and events were attended by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Fidel V. Ramos. Unlike other dates reserved for national heroes of the Philippines (like Bonifacio Day, Rizal Day, Araw ng Kagitingan, and National Heroes Day), the date is not a \\"regular holiday\\" (double pay for working nationals) but only a \\"special non- working holiday\\" (premium of thirty-percent for working nationals). Background Aquino was a well-known opposition figure and critic of the then-President Ferdinand Marcos. Due to his beliefs, he was later imprisoned for about eight years after martial law was declared in the country. Even in his imprisonment, he sought a parliamentary seat for Metro Manila in the Interim Batasang Pambansa, under the banner of the Lakas ng Bayan (LABAN). He eventually led in the opinion polls and was initially leading the electoral count but eventually lost to the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL) slate led by First Lady Imelda Marcos. Aquino remained in prison but continued to fight for democracy in the country and against the oppression of the Filipino people. After suffering from a heart attack in March 1980, he and his family moved to the United States for medical treatment, eventually leading to his self- imposed exile for about three years. There, he continued his advocacy by giving speeches to the Filipino-American communities. Later, he planned to return to the islands to challenge Marcos for the parliamentary elections in 1984. Though some did not feel this was a good idea, he still did so in 1983. Upon returning to the Philippines at the Manila International Airport (now renamed Ninoy Aquino International Airport in his honor), he was shot and killed on August 21, 1983 as he was escorted off an airplane by security personnel. This led to several protests at his funeral that sparked snap presidential elections in 1986, which led to the 1986 EDSA Revolution, catapulting his wife, Corazon Aquino, to the presidency. History The holiday was created by Republic Act 9256, which was signed into law by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on February 25, 2004, twenty-one years after his death and the eighteen years after the People Power Revolution., and was sponsored by Senate President Franklin Drilon and House Speaker Jose de Venecia. It requires an EDSA People Power Commission (EPPC) to hold activities in observance the day and shall be funded from the Budget of the Office of the President and from private donations.http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/pe/pe002867.htm A commemoration ceremony was held at the People Power Monument which was attended by Presidents Arroyo and Aquino, the Aquino family, and government officials such as members of the cabinet, top police, and military brass. The holiday was included in President Arroyo's program of \\"holiday economics\\", adjusting the observance of the holiday to the nearest Monday in order to boost the tourism industry with long weekends.http://www.gmanews.tv/story/54986/Aug-20-holiday- proclamation-signed In 2010, it was moved back to its original date by Aquino's only son, President Benigno Aquino III.

The Vacuum is a free newspaper published in Belfast, Northern Ireland by the arts organisation Factotum. Each issue is themed and contains critical commentary about the city and broader cultural issues. The paper is distributed in bars, caf√©s and other public spaces. It was first published in January 2003. A topical newspaper Each issue of The Vacuum is centred on a topical theme, around which writers and artists are commissioned to produce articles and illustrations. These themes can be open-ended ‚Äì such as in the 'Fantasy' issue when contributors were simply asked to describe one of their fantasies ‚Äì or more specific such as the 'Nostalgia' issue which contained articles on 'Troubles Nostalgia' and 'Marketing Nostalgia'. Most issues contain a range of writing from social commentary, through satire to farce, focused on one area of discussion. Rarely does The Vacuum avoid controversy, no matter what its chosen issue. Some of the past topics have included: The Cover of the 'God' issue of the Vacuum which, along with the 'Satan' issue caused protests in Belfast City Council. *'Food and Drink' *'Danger' *'Prison' *'Education' *'The End' (in the month it was threatened with closure, see below) *'Waste' *'Security' Contributors to The Vacuum have included writers such as Glenn Patterson, Colin Graham, Leontia Flynn, Stephen Mullan, Daniel Jewesbury, John Morrow, Richard Kirkland, Newton Emerson, Roy Foster and the artists Duncan Ross and David Haughey. 2004 controversy The Cover of the 'Sorry' issue of The Vacuum, part of a response to Belfast City Council's demand for an apology. In June 2004 the two issues themed 'God' and 'Satan' were published simultaneously. Based on one complaint from a member of the public, some Belfast City councillors (Belfast City Council funded Factotum) denounced the publication as \\"filth\\" that was \\"encouraging devil worship\\" News story in the Guardian about the controversy with Belfast City Council at their monthly Council meeting. The Council then withheld an agreed funding allocation of ¬£3,300 until the newspaper apologised to the citizens of Belfast for any offence caused. The Vacuum responded by publishing a special 'Sorry' issue and holding a tongue-in-cheek, citywide 'Sorry Day' in December 2004.Website explaining the background to Sorry day and documenting what took place Following this protest Richard West, one of the paper's editors (along with Stephen Hackett), challenged the Council's demand for an apology in the High Court as a breach of articles 9 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In May 2006 the case was lost.Judgement by Judge Deeny The case then went to the Court of Appeal and, as of May 2009, a judgement on this appeal is still awaited. The Vacuum post controversy The Vacuum has continued to publish but now comes out intermittently. At least two recent issues (on the 'English' and 'Spin'Information about the Century of Spin exhibition at Belfast Exposed ) have coincided with exhibitions organised by the publishers in the photography gallery Belfast Exposed. Both this gallery and the offices of The Vacuum are in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast. There is a historical precedent for literary satire in the area; in the 19th century, the area was home to a Punch-style satirical magazine, The Northern Whig.

Located in the centre of Grimsby it is visited annually by 14 million shoppers and employs over 2000 retail workers. The centre houses over 100 stores, with the anchor stores of 15-17, Marks and Spencer, Next and Primark and Deichmann and British Heart Foundation and Game from 2018. Development Constructed between 1967 and 1971 in a joint venture between the old Grimsby Borough Council and developers Hammerson's UK Ltd., it was known as the Riverhead Centre (so named as the development was adjacent to where the two local rivers, the Freshney and the Haven, meet). It is situated to the north of Victoria Street, the main pedestrianised shopping street of the town. The Riverhead Centre development caused some controversy as it replaced old architecture with new, as was typical in the 1960s. It demolished much of the old town centre, including the historic Bull Ring (which is now where Wilkos, the Halifax Bank and the St James Hotel are based), and streets going back many centuries, including Flottergate (located at the present-day entrance to Freshney Place between Poundland and the market), Brewery Street (located at the present-day entrance to Freshney Place between Barclays and the offices of the ), and East St Mary's Gate (no trace remains). During this reconstruction, the ornate Victorian branch of the Midland Bank was demolished; a building of contemporary design was incorporated into the new shopping centre. In 1983 Marks and Spencer purchased the local department store Lawson and Stockdale, whose frontage ran along Victoria Street; they demolished the building and constructed a new store, linked to the centre. In 1990 the council agreed to sell the surface parking area around the shopping centre to Hammerson's UK Ltd. The development owner and Humberside County Council, the highway authority, agreed to the sale of the area of Baxtergate, the road which ran to the rear of the shopping centre, between the shopping centre and the surface car park. Baxtergate was relocated alongside the River Freshney and became phase one of the Peaks Parkway. Freshney Place 2008 Hammerson's UK Ltd began a ¬£100 million redevelopment of the retail centre, doubling it in size. The expanded centre was covered in a glass roof. Two multi-storey car parks were constructed at each end of the centre; with this development, the old Top Town area of Grimsby was effectively privatised and roofed over. Stores are serviced at the first floor by ramps at the western end, which can accommodate even large vehicles. The ramp also provides access to the car park on the roof of the indoor market, which is operated by the local council. Freshney Place won a design commendation in the Refurbishment Category of the 1993 BCSC awards.

It is situated on College Green, opposite the Cathedral and at the foot of Park Street in Bristol city centre (). Throughout its history it has been home to Bristol City Council. Designed in the 1930s but built after the Second World War, it is a grade II* listed building. Building The rear of the Bristol City Hall from Cabot Tower The building was commissioned to replace the Old Council House, Bristol. The new building was designed by Vincent Harris in a concrete frame, clad with very wide, thin bricks, with Portland stone dressings and a leaded hipped roof in a pastiche Neo-Georgian style. The steep and high roof with gilded unicorns to the corners of the end blocks. The foundation stone for the Council House was laid in 1938 and, although completed in 1952, the building was only opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 17 April 1956. The ceremonial entrance overlooks the moat and leads into the reception hall which is lined with local Doulting stone and paved with black and white Italian marble. It also features a blue and gold wall clock, encircled by the signs of the zodiac and equipped with its own wind indicator. The Conference Hall is the largest room in the building. The names of all Mayors and Lord Mayors of Bristol since 1216 are cut into the stone walls. The walls of the Lord Mayor's Reception Room are panelled in English Walnut and there is a colourful frieze displaying the heraldry of the Bristol trade guilds, and, in gold leaf, the names of famous Bristolians. The building was formerly known as the Council House, but was renamed by George Ferguson, CBE, the Mayor of Bristol, on his first day in office to City Hall, on 19 November 2012. Features The ceiling of the council chamber was designed by John Armstrong (1893‚Äì1973) and depicts buildings in Bristol at the edge and the centre details sailing ships from different periods of Bristol History. The four corners show the allegorical figures of Enterprise, Wisdom, Industry and Navigation. The ceiling in the Conference Room is by Sir Walter Thomas Monnington (1902‚Äì1976) on the theme of molecular and atomic fusion. In 2005, a bust of Tony Benn, the famous Labour Party politician and the Member of Parliament for the former Bristol South East constituency from 1950 to 1960, and again from 1963 to 1983, was unveiled by the man himself in the building's foyer. Environmental aspects Refurbishment of the electrical and heating systems have incorporated the use of rainwater recycling for flushing toilets and an air-conditioning system that will discharge excess heat into the surrounding water filled moat rather than expelling it into the atmosphere. Popular culture *One of the building's gilded unicorns appears in the opening credits of the first and fifth series of popular television show, Skins. *One of the unicorns also features in a hologram on the latest edition of the ¬£B10 banknote of the Bristol Pound.

The skeleton presents a small skull akin to that of non-hominin apes, plus evidence of a walking-gait that was bipedal and upright, akin to that of humans (and other hominins); this combination supports the view of human evolution that bipedalism preceded increase in brain size.Hadar entry in Encyclop√¶dia (2008). A 2016 study proposes that Australopithecus afarensis was also to a large extent tree- dwelling, though the extent of this is debated. \\"Lucy\\" acquired her name from the song \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" by the Beatles, which was played loudly and repeatedly in the expedition camp all evening after the excavation team's first day of work on the recovery site. After public announcement of the discovery, Lucy captured much public interest, becoming a household name at the time. Lucy became famous worldwide, and the story of her discovery and reconstruction was published in a book by Johanson. Beginning in 2007, the fossil assembly and associated artifacts were exhibited publicly in an extended six-year tour of the United States; the exhibition was called Lucy's Legacy: The Hidden Treasures of Ethiopia. There was discussion of the risks of damage to the unique fossils, and other museums preferred to display casts of the fossil assembly. The original fossils were returned to Ethiopia in 2013, and subsequent exhibitions have used casts. Discovery French geologist and paleoanthropologist Maurice Taieb discovered the Hadar Formation for paleoanthropology in 1970 in the Afar Triangle of Ethiopia in Hararghe region; he recognized its potential as a likely repository of the fossils and artifacts of human origins. Taieb formed the International Afar Research Expedition (IARE) and invited three prominent international scientists to conduct research expeditions into the region. These were: Donald Johanson, an American paleoanthropologist and curator at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, who later founded the Institute of Human Origins, now part of Arizona State University; Mary Leakey, the noted British paleoanthropologist; and Yves Coppens, a French paleoanthropologist now based at the Coll√®ge de France which is considered to be France's most prestigious research establishment. An expedition was soon mounted with four American and seven French participants; in the autumn of 1973 the team began surveying sites around Hadar for signs related to the origin of humans. Side view of cast of Lucy in the Naturmuseum Senckenberg In November 1971, near the end of the first field season, Johanson noticed a fossil of the upper end of a shinbone, which had been sliced slightly at the front. The lower end of a femur was found near it, and when he fitted them together, the angle of the knee joint clearly showed that this fossil, reference AL 129-1, was an upright walking hominin. This fossil was later dated at more than three million years old‚Äîmuch older than other hominin fossils known at the time. The site lay about from the site where \\"Lucy\\" subsequently was found, in a rock stratum deeper than that in which the Lucy fragments were found. The team returned for the second field season the following year and found hominin jaws. Then, on the morning of 24 November 1974, near the Awash River, Johanson abandoned a plan to update his field notes and joined graduate student Tom Gray to search Locality 162 for bone fossils. By Johanson's later (published) accounts, both he and Tom Gray spent two hours on the increasingly hot and arid plain, surveying the dusty terrain. On a hunch, Johanson decided to look at the bottom of a small gully that had been checked at least twice before by other workers. At first view nothing was immediately visible, but as they turned to leave a fossil caught Johanson's eye; an arm bone fragment was lying on the slope. Near it lay a fragment from the back of a small skull. They noticed part of a femur (thigh bone) a few feet (about one meter) away. As they explored further, they found more and more bones on the slope, including vertebrae, part of a pelvis, ribs, and pieces of jaw. They marked the spot and returned to camp, excited at finding so many pieces apparently from one individual hominin. Cast of Lucy in Mexico In the afternoon, all members of the expedition returned to the gully to section off the site and prepare it for careful excavation and collection, which eventually took three weeks. That first evening they celebrated at the camp; at some stage during the evening they named fossil AL 288-1 \\"Lucy\\", after the Beatles' song \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\", which was being played loudly and repeatedly on a tape recorder in the camp. Over the next three weeks the team found several hundred pieces or fragments of bone with no duplication, confirming their original speculation that the pieces were from a single individual; ultimately, it was determined that an amazing 40 percent of a hominin skeleton was recovered at the site. Johanson assessed it as female based on the one complete pelvic bone and sacrum, which indicated the width of the pelvic opening. Lucy was tall, weighed , and (after reconstruction) looked somewhat like a chimpanzee. The creature had a small brain like a chimpanzee, but the pelvis and leg bones were almost identical in function to those of modern humans, showing with certainty that Lucy's species were hominins that had stood upright and had walked erect. With the permission of the government of Ethiopia, Johanson brought all the skeletal fragments to the Cleveland Museum of Natural History in Ohio, where they were stabilized and reconstructed by anthropologist Owen Lovejoy. Lucy the pre-human hominid and fossil hominin, captured much public notice; she became almost a household name at the time. Some nine years later, and now assembled altogether, she was returned to Ethiopia. Additional finds of A. afarensis were made during the 1970s and forward, gaining for anthropologists a better understanding of the ranges of morphic variability and sexual dimorphism within the species. An even more complete skeleton of a related hominid, Ardipithecus, was found in the same Awash Valley in 1992. \\"Ardi\\", like \\"Lucy\\", was a hominid-becoming- hominin species, but, dated at , it had evolved much earlier than the afarensis species. Excavation, preservation, and analysis of the specimen Ardi was very difficult and time-consuming; work was begun in 1992, with the results not fully published until October 2009. Age estimates of the Lucy fossil Initial attempts were made in 1974 by Maurice Taieb and James Aronson in Aronson's laboratory at Case Western Reserve University to estimate the age of the fossils using the potassium-argon radiometric dating method. These efforts were hindered by several factors: the rocks in the recovery area were chemically altered or reworked by volcanic activity; datable crystals were very scarce in the sample material; and there was a complete absence of pumice clasts at Hadar. (The Lucy skeleton occurs in the part of the Hadar sequence that accumulated with the fastest rate of deposition, which partly accounts for her excellent preservation.) Fieldwork at Hadar was suspended in the winter of 1976‚Äì77. When it was resumed thirteen years later in 1990, the more precise argon-argon technology had been updated by Derek York at the University of Toronto. By 1992 Aronson and Robert Walter had found two suitable samples of volcanic ash‚Äîthe older layer of ash was about 18 m below the fossil and the younger layer was only one meter below, closely marking the age of deposition of the specimen. These samples were argon-argon dated by Walter in the geochronology laboratory of the Institute of Human Origins at 3.22 and 3.18 million years. Notable characteristics =Ambulation= Lucy skeleton reconstruction at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History One of the most striking characteristics of the Lucy skeleton is a valgus knee, which indicates that she normally moved by walking upright. Her femur presents a mix of ancestral and derived traits. The femoral head is small and the femoral neck is short; both are primitive traits. The greater trochanter, however, is clearly a derived trait, being short and human-like‚Äîeven though, unlike in humans, it is situated higher than the femoral head. The length ratio of her humerus (arm) to femur (thigh) is 84.6%, which compares to 71.8% for modern humans, and 97.8% for common chimpanzees, indicating that either the arms of A. afarensis were beginning to shorten, the legs were beginning to lengthen, or both were occurring simultaneously. Lucy also had a lordose curve, or lumbar curve, another indicator of habitual bipedalism. (Introduction) She apparently had physiological flat feet, not to be confused with pes planus or any pathology, even though other afarensis individuals appear to have had arched feet. =Pelvic girdle= Johanson recovered Lucy's left innominate bone and sacrum. Though the sacrum was remarkably well preserved, the innominate was distorted, leading to two different reconstructions. The first reconstruction had little iliac flare and virtually no anterior wrap, creating an ilium that greatly resembled that of an ape. However, this reconstruction proved to be faulty, as the superior pubic rami would not have been able to connect were the right ilium identical to the left. A later reconstruction by Tim White showed a broad iliac flare and a definite anterior wrap, indicating that Lucy had an unusually broad inner acetabular distance and unusually long superior pubic rami. Her pubic arch was over 90 degrees and derived; that is, similar to modern human females. Her acetabulum, however, was small and primitive. =Cranial specimens= The cranial evidence recovered from Lucy is far less derived than her postcranium. Her neurocranium is small and primitive, while she possesses more spatulate canines than other apes. The cranial capacity was about 375 to 500 cc. =Rib cage and plant-based diet= Australopithecus afarensis seems to have had the same conical rib-cage found in today's non-human great apes (like the chimpanzee and gorilla), which allows room for a large stomach below and indicates the longer intestine needed for digesting voluminous plant matter. Fully 60% of the blood supply of non-human apes is used in the digestion process, greatly impeding the development of brain function (which is limited thereby to using about 10% of the circulation). The heavier musculature of the jaws‚Äîthose muscles operating the intensive masticatory process for chewing plant material‚Äîsimilarly would also limit development, here of the skull (braincase). During evolution of the human lineage these muscles seem to have weakened with the loss of the myosin gene MYH16, a two base-pair deletion that occurred about 2.4 million years ago. =Other findings= A study of the mandible across a number of specimens of A. afarensis indicated that Lucy's jaw was rather unlike other hominins, having a more gorilla-like appearance. Rak et al. concluded that this morphology arose \\"independently in gorillas and hominins\\", and that A. afarensis is \\"too derived to occupy a position as a common ancestor of both the Homo and robust australopith clades\\". A work of the American Museum of Natural History uncovered a possible baboon fragment that was found mixed in Lucy's fragments. Age at death Lucy's cause of death cannot be determined. The specimen does not show the signs of post-mortem bone damage characteristic of animals killed by predators and then scavenged. The only visible damage is a single carnivore tooth mark on the top of her left pubic bone, believed to have occurred at or around the time of death, but which is not necessarily related to her death. Her third molars were erupted and slightly worn and, therefore, it was concluded that she was fully matured with completed skeletal development. There are indications of degenerative disease to her vertebrae that do not necessarily indicate old age. It is believed that she was a mature but young adult when she died, about 12 years old.ASU Institute of human origins, Lucy's story In 2016 researchers at the University of Texas at Austin suggested that Lucy died after falling from a tall tree. Donald Johanson and Tim White disagreed with the suggestions. Exhibitions The Lucy skeleton is preserved at the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa. A plaster replica is publicly displayed there instead of the original skeleton. A cast of the original skeleton in its reconstructed form is displayed at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. At the American Museum of Natural History in New York City a diorama presents Australopithecus afarensis and other human predecessors, showing each species and its habitat and explaining the behaviors and capabilities assigned to each. A cast of the skeleton as well as a corpus reconstruction of Lucy is displayed at The Field Museum in Chicago. =US tour= A six-year exhibition tour of the United States was undertaken during 2007‚Äì13; it was titled Lucy's Legacy: The Hidden Treasures of Ethiopia and it featured the actual Lucy fossil reconstruction and over 100 artifacts from prehistoric times to the present. The tour was organized by the Houston Museum of Natural Science and was approved by the Ethiopian government and the U.S. State Department. A portion of the proceeds from the tour was designated to modernizing Ethiopia's museums. There was controversy in advance of the tour over concerns about the fragility of the specimens, with various experts including paleoanthropologist Owen Lovejoy and anthropologist and conservationist Richard Leakey publicly stating their opposition. For these reasons, the Smithsonian Institution and Cleveland Museum of Natural History and other museums declined to host the exhibits. The fossil's discoverer Don Johanson stated his concern for the possibility of damage, but did not oppose touring and exhibiting Lucy, as he felt it would raise awareness of human- origins studies. The Houston Museum made arrangements for exhibiting at ten other museums, including the Pacific Science Center in Seattle. In September 2008, between the exhibits in Houston and Seattle, the skeletal assembly was taken to the University of Texas at Austin for 10 days to perform high- resolution CT scans of the fossils. Lucy was exhibited at the Discovery Times Square Exposition in New York City from June until October 2009. In New York, the exhibition included Ida (Plate B), the other half of the recently announced Darwinius masilae fossil. She was also exhibited in Mexico at the Mexico Museum of Anthropology until its return to Ethiopia in May 2013.

An entrance test is required of all prospective freshmen students. Academic scholarships are also based on the results of this test. The school's Educational Services Program (ESP) assists girls with learning disabilities. History St. Ursula Academy was established in 1910 by the newly founded Ursuline community as a private academy for students from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. The sisters had an enrollment of sixty-three pupils that first year when classes were held in a house they rented at Ingleside and McMillan. The following year the school was in session at 1339 East McMillan in the Worcester residence, which the sisters had recently purchased. In December 1910, the community acquired the Schuster-Martin building. The facilities were enhanced in 1915 with the building of a chapel wing, which connected the two original buildings and also provided enlarged kitchen and dining areas. About the same time, the far west building was built by Bellamy Storer and his wife, Maria Longworth Nichols Storer, as their residence. When the Storers died, the building became the property of the sisters and was utilized for additional classroom space. In 1952 two smaller houses adjacent to the west wing were purchased. The original gym-auditorium was added in 1954. Every inch of space was used to the fullest to accommodate the growing number of students. A new classroom wing was added to St. Ursula in 1967. For several years the McMillan Street site was the school for grades one through twelve. In 1960 the purchase of the twenty-five acre LeBlond estate in Mt. Lookout enabled the community to provide space for the elementary division, known as St. Ursula Villa. Unlike the high school, the Villa is coeducational. Although the Villa is not officially part of St. Ursula Academy, more than 60% of its recent female graduates went on to attend the Academy. More than 60% of its recent male graduates went on to attend St. Xavier High School. St. Ursula Academy is now chartered as a four-year college preparatory high school, and grades seven and eight are located at the Villa. November 1985 marked the seventy-fifth anniversary of St. Ursula's foundation. With the generous support of alumnae, friends, and parents, the physical plant underwent an extensive renovation, enabling the school to accommodate an increasing number of students. From the beginning until the 1990s, St. Ursula Academy was owned and operated by the Ursulines of Cincinnati. From its earliest days, however, the support and assistance of lay alumnae, parents, and friends were critical for its success. In the late 1970s, the sisters formalized that support by establishing the Advisory Board. In 1994 St. Ursula Academy was incorporated as a separate entity and is now governed by a Board of Trustees. In 1999 St. Ursula Academy purchased the McMillan Street property from the Ursulines of Cincinnati. In March 2000, the two small buildings at the comer of Upland and Fleming Streets were demolished to make room for the construction of a new academic building. This building encompasses four levels and provides eight new science classrooms/labs, 10 general classrooms, and two music rooms. In all these changes, the philosophy of the school, its emphasis on the religious formation of its students, and its pursuit of academic excellence are being strengthened by the combined commitment of the Ursulines of Cincinnati, the faculty, the administration, and the Board of Trustees. In June 2002, construction began on a gymnasium/convocation center and was completed in June 2003. In April 2017, the nearby University of Cincinnati announced that its women's basketball and women's volleyball teams would play their home games in the 2017‚Äì18 school year at the St. Ursula Gymnasium & Convocation Center while the teams' normal home of Fifth Third Arena undergoes renovations.  Tablet PC program  The one-on-one tablet PC program was introduced with the class of 2010 to aid in St. Ursula Academy's mission of preparing women for a changing world. All students now use the tablets daily in class, and their classes are expected to be \\"paperless\\" for the most part. St. Ursula was the first school in Cincinnati to have this program, and many schools now look to Saint Ursula for guidance in developing and enhancing their own one-to-one programs.

He played at both half-back and left-wing during his football career and many trophies for middle-distance running. Beaumont was born in Wrestlingworth, Bedfordshire, and began his career with Colchester Town. He moved on to Lincoln City, making his league debut in the 1904‚Äì05 season. However, he made just five league appearances for the Imps before joining Bedfordshire side Biggleswade & District. He joined Watford in 1909, playing in the Southern League. He played 25 times for Watford before joining Preston North End in 1911, Beaumont at Preston North End. Bottom row, third from right but made just one league appearance before joining Merthyr Town in the 1912 close season. He also played for Merthy Town Cricket Club. Beaumont at Merthyr Town Cricket Club He spent just one season with Merthyr, making fifteen appearances, before joining Troedyrhiw in the summer of 1913. He later finished his playing career with Llanelli. Beaumont at Llanelly FC After steering Barry Town to their first ever league championship in 1921, the summer of 1923 saw Beaumont appointed as manager of Third Division South side Aberdare Athletic. Aberdare finished 9th in the 1925/26 season, but a combination of circumstances, including industrial action amongst the local mining community which affected attendances and the burning down of a wooden grandstand, meant that Aberdare's poor financial situation deteriorated. At the end of the 1926/27, Aberdare failed to gain re- election to the league and were replaced by Torquay United. Beaumont left that summer, but was soon appointed as manager of Blackpool, another club with severe financial problems at that time. He took over from Frank Buckley and immediately began to dismantle the team and bring in big-money names. His outlook was different from that of his predecessor, and his overhaul of tactics resulted in problems. The team struggled, losing five of their first six league games (a draw at Swansea on the opening day being the exception to the rule). One tactic that did work, however, was his moving Billy Tremelling from centre-forward back to half-back, which resulted in a fruitful partnership with Jimmy Hampson (a player Beaumont had brought to the seaside). Being a former Preston North End player hardly endeared Beaumont to the Blackpool faithful. As the Seasiders struggled in Division Two, criticism of Beaumont grew. Eventually, in May 1928, with the team in the bottom three, he resigned ‚Äî at the time becoming the club's shortest-serving manager with 42 League games to his name.Calley, Roy.

It functions in analgesia. It is located in the rostral, intermediate, and caudal regions of the hypothalamus. The rostral region aids in the production of both somatostatin and thyroid releasing hormone. The intermediate portion aids in production of thyroid releasing hormone, somatostatin, leptin, gastrin, and neuropeptide y. In humans and primates it also produces GnRH. Lastly the caudal region aids in sympathetic nervous system regulation, and is regarded as the rage center. The periventricular nucleus does not have an effective blood‚Äìbrain barrier. 11Œ≤-HSD2 expression turns cortisol into cortisone.  Role in LH and GnRH release  This nucleus has been shown to affect the release of GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) in several ways. One way is its expression of neuropeptide Y, which has an impact on the hypothalamic pathway responsible for GnRH secretion. The periventricular nucleus has also been shown to have many neurons that express kisspeptin, which generates a surge in LH, which ultimately leads to the release of GnRH. In female rats, there is a greater expression of estrogen receptor beta in the periventricular nuclear cells, which is thought to lead to different levels of LH secretion in males and females.  Role in GH release  This region has been shown to aid in the production of somatostatin and research shows that neurons releasing somatostatin are stimulated to do so by glutamatergic innervation and then this allows them to stimulate the release of growth hormone. There is thought to be a differential level of secretion of somatostatin between males and females by the periventricular nucleus and that is thought to be responsible for the sexual dimorphism of growth hormone secretion. It has also been suggested that leptin secretion also plays a role in the release of GH from periventricular nucleus and that this hormone interacts with both somatostatin and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) in the GH release pathway. This is further supported by the presence of leptin receptors in neurons of the periventricular nucleus. GH may also be able to provide regulatory feedback on the periventricular nucleus by increasing cytokine signaling to the hypothalamus which inhibits the GH release pathway.

It is one of 4 high schools in the South-Western City Schools District. SWCS is located in the southwestern portion of Franklin County in Columbus, Ohio. Westland High School was opened in 1970. History =Founding= In 1969, Pleasant View Junior/Senior High School became a middle school when the newly built, Westland High School was constructed due to the need for more space to meet population growth in the Southwest Columbus region. =Current Building= In the 2011-2012 school year, the building received minor renovations to lighting systems and a new ventilation system was put into place after an incident at the school. There are plans in place to renovate the roof of Westland through out the summer of 2019. The cafeteria has a mezzanine, known to students as \\"The Mez\\", where seniors sit during their lunch period. =School Colors= The school colors, forest green and white, are picked from two middle schools, that feed into Westland. The school color of white is from Norton Middle School while forest green is from Pleasant View Middle.  Sports  = Rivalries = Westland High School has both inactive and active rivalries between intra-district and other city schools. The major rivalry is between Westland High School and Central Crossing High School, another SWCS school.  Central Crossing  Westland has a current rivalry with intra-district Central Crossing High School, and the two schools played each other for the first time in 2008.  Grove City  The school had a traditional rivalry with its sister school, Grove City High School. The two teams even played football games at Cooper Stadium, the city's former minor league baseball park, but Grove City and Westland are no longer allowed to play one another because of fights that emerged during games. The two schools played each other annually from 1970-1973 and from 1981-1998. They have not played since. Westland is crosstown rivals with the former Hilliard High School, now Hilliard Davidson High School. = Football = The Westland Football program is currently coached by Rick Rios and play in the Ohio Capital Conference's Central Division. The Cougars play their home games at Westland Field, which seats around 5,000 people.  History  Since its first football season in 1970, Westland has an all-time record of 131-257-2. Westland won OCC titles in 1970, 1992 and 1993. From 1990 to 1994 Head coach Tom Greer won 32 games and several players earned all conference honors. Westland lost its football program during the 2009 season with the August failure of the Southwestern City School District levy. Football returned to Westland in 2010.

He is co-director with Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) in Washington, D.C. Weisbrot is President of Just Foreign Policy, a non- governmental organization dedicated to reforming United States foreign policy.  Early life and education  Weisbrot was born in Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign with a bachelor's degree in economics. Weisbrot received his Ph.D. in economics from the University of Michigan.  Career  In 1999, Weisbrot co-founded, together with economist Dean Baker, the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), a think tank which produces economic research on topics that affect people's lives to contribute to the public debate in the U.S. (inequality, macroeconomic policy and stability, labor markets, health and social programs, intellectual property, social security), and internationally: globalization and trade, the International Monetary Fund and institutions of global governance, Latin American and European economies, and US foreign policy. Weisbrot provided testimony to Congressional hearings in 2002 to a United States House of Representatives committee on the Argentine economic crisis (1999‚Äì2002) and in 2004 to the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on the state of democracy in Venezuela with what he claimed were U.S. efforts to undermine the government, and the media inside the country. As an economist, Weisbrot has opposed privatization of the United States Social Security system and has been critical of neoliberal globalization and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). His work on Greece's ongoing debt crisis has influenced the debate over what measures the Greek government should take in negotiating a solution with the European Central Bank, European Commission, and the International Monetary Fund. =Globalization= Weisbrot argues that globalization as promoted by the United States government and multilateral lending institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and The World Bank has failed poorer countries, stating that \\"no nation has ever pulled itself out of poverty under the conditions that Washington imposes on underdeveloped countries.\\" Economist Jeffrey Sachs has stated that Weisbrot was \\"the leader in fighting\\" the Washington Consensus behind much of this globalization.Event Transcript - The Scorecard on Development, 1960‚Äì2016: China and the Global Economic Rebound. CEPR. Retrieved on March 15, 2018. Weisbrot has been described as the \\"intellectual architect\\" behind the unsuccessful Bank of the South, a joint project by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Ecuador, Bolivia and Venezuela which was spearheaded by Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez. He criticized the role played by the IMF while taking an active role in promoting the bank, describing the Bank of the South as \\"another Declaration of Independence for South America\\" and that it was \\"Latin America casting off Washington's shackles\\". Weisbrot co-authors with CEPR a series of papers looking at the progress in economic growth and social indicators. In 2017, he presented the most recent report, which emphasized the role of China, with economist Jeffrey Sachs in Washington, DC. Weisbrot has continued to suggest that the founding of other alternative lending and finance institutions that do not include participation by the U.S., such as those being created by the BRICS countries, may have positive implications both for borrowing countries and in terms of weakening the influence of Washington-based institutions like the IMF. =Latin America= Weisbrot in 2017 Weisbrot has written and co- authored research papers and articles on the economies and politics of Latin America and the Caribbean for the past two decades. The countries covered include Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, and Venezuela. Beginning in 2001, Weisbrot challenged the prevailing consensus on the Argentine economic crisis, arguing that IMF-supported austerity was counter-productive and that the country needed to devalue its currency in order to recover. After the Argentine government defaulted on its debt at the end of 2001, and allowed the currency to float against the dollar at the beginning of 2002, Weisbrot continued to argue against what he called harmful attempts by the IMF to influence policy in the post-default period. He later wrote papers arguing the Argentina's policies in the 2002-2011 period, after its default and separation from the IMF, were successful. Weisbrot has argued that, from 2003 to 2011, Brazil was successful in reducing poverty and inequality, and increasing GDP growth. Weisbrot attributed these successes in part to policy changes that were an improvement over the neoliberal program Brazil adopted in the 1980s. However, he was critical of austerity and high interest rates after 2010, arguing that these were unnecessary and led to a prolonged recession. Weisbrot argued against the impeachment of former Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff in 2016 and the corruption conviction of former president Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva in 2018, pointing to a lack of precedent and evidence to justify the proceedings. = Venezuela = Articles in The New York Times, USA Today, and The Washington Post describe Weisbrot as supportive of the policies implemented during Hugo Ch√°vez's presidency. In a 2016 National Review article about Venezuela's deterioration following the Bolivarian Revolution, Weisbrot was described as one of the \\"leftist admirers of Venezuela\\" and an \\"ardent cheerleader\\" of Hugo Ch√°vez's policies. In 2013, Weisbrot praised the Venezuelan government for what he said were gains in poverty, real income, employment, healthcare, and education, and argued that others were \\"crying wolf\\", saying that the possibility of hyperinflation was \\"very remote\\", that economic problems were \\"not likely\\" and that \\"Venezuela has sufficient reserves\\".Weisbrot, Mark. Sorry, Venezuela haters: this economy is not the Greece of Latin America. Guardian, 7 November 2013. Retrieved on 14 March 2018. In 2014, Weisbrot and his colleague Deborah James attended the \\"Ch√°vez Was Here\\" gathering organized by the Embassy of Venezuela, Washington, D.C. on the one-year anniversary of the death of Hugo Ch√°vez. While speaking on the panel, he praised the achievements of the Bolivarian Revolution while criticizing the Latin American media, the English-language media and the Venezuelan opposition. Includes audio A 2019 report by Weisbrot and Jeffrey Sachs, claimed that a 31% rise in the number of deaths between 2017 and 2018 was due to the sanctions imposed on Venezuela in 2017, and that 40,000 people in Venezuela may have died as a result. The report states: \\"The sanctions are depriving Venezuelans of lifesaving medicines, medical equipment, food, and other essential imports.\\" Weisbrot stated that he \\"could not prove those excess deaths were the result of sanctions, but said the increase ran parallel to the imposition of the measures and an attendant fall in oil production\\". A US State Department spokesperson commented that, \\"as the writers themselves concede, the report is based on speculation and conjecture\\". The spokesperson added: \\"The economic situation in Venezuela has been deteriorating for decades, as Venezuelans themselves will confirm, thanks to Maduro's ineptitude and economic mismanagement.\\" Harvard conomist Ricardo Hausmann, Juan Guaid√≥'s representative to the Inter-American Development Bank, asserts that the analysis is flawed because it makes invalid assumptions about Venezuela based on a different country, Colombia, saying that \\"taking what happened in Colombia since 2017 as a counterfactual for what would have happened in Venezuela if there had been no financial sanctions makes no sense\\". Calling it \\"sloppy reasoning\\", the authors also state that the analysis failed to rule out other explanations, and failed to correctly account for PDVSA finances.  South of the Border  Weisbrot was an advisor, and co-wrote with Tariq Ali the screenplay for the Oliver Stone's 2009 film, South of the Border, which examined the \\"pink tide\\" of elected leftist governments in South America. Weisbrot disagreed with Larry Rohter, the former South American bureau chief of The New York Times, over his statements on Venezuela, where Rohter claimed that in support of the film South of the Border, Weisbrot, Tariq Ali, and Oliver Stone manipulated data to present a positive image of Hugo Ch√°vez. Rohter described Weisbrot as \\"... an economist, not a historian, and apparently not a very good one\\", suggesting that he was \\"Either ... incompetent [or] deliberately manipulating the numbers.\\" Weisbrot contested the claims of inaccuracies, suggesting that they are indicative of sloppy and misleading coverage of Venezuela in the popular press, and saying that \\"the way most Americans get the idea that Venezuela is a dictatorship, for example, is from these editorials\\". = Columns = Weisbrot writes for The Nation, and The Hill. He also writes an economic and policy issues column that is distributed across the United States by McClatchy-Tribune Information Services. From 2009 to 2014, he wrote a regular column for The Guardian. = Books = Weisbrot is co-author, with Baker, of Social Security: The Phony Crisis (University of Chicago Press, 1999). In the book, Weisbrot and Baker argue that much of the United States Social Security debate has been based on misconceptions, that privatization would be unlikely to improve the system, and that the system, in fact, performs satisfactorily and does not need substantial changes, needing only minor adjustments to in order to continue to pay all promised benefits for the ensuing 75 years. In reviewing the book, The Economist wrote that ‚ÄúDean Baker and Mark Weisbrot have no trouble at all demonstrating that even on highly conservative assumptions about economic growth, the much-forecast insolvency of the Social Security system by about 2030 is most unlikely to happen then, if indeed ever.‚Äù Weisbrot's latest book is Failed: What the Experts Got Wrong About the Global Economy (Oxford University Press, 2015). In an interview, Weisbrot described the book as critiquing the bad macroeconomic policies often imposed by European authorities, who are ultimately unaccountable to the citizens of the sovereign states that they represent. These policies, he says, prolonged the economic crises in the aftermath of the Great Recession in Europe, which had a much higher unemployment rate than in the U.S., and forced unpopular economic policies of more vulnerable European countries. Weisbrot has made these arguments in various contexts over the years, for example on Greece, on Spain, and most recently, in The New York Times on the 2017 French presidential election. In an otherwise positive review, Weisbrot was criticized for advocating that Greece would have been better off had it had left the eurozone during its economic crisis. Noam Chomsky called Failed \\"careful and well- documented\\" and said it \\"makes a persuasive case that one goal of the [policies imposed by European authorities] has been to dismantle the social democratic policies that were one of Europe‚Äôs contributions to civilized life in the post-World War II period but were unwelcome to major centers of traditional power\\".  Reception  Francisco Rodr√≠guez, an economist of Wesleyan University accused Weisbrot of being biased for praising Hugo Ch√°vez's economic policies and stated that Weisbrot's work had a \\"use of heavily slanted data\\". In a History News Network article, Larry Rohter, the former South American bureau chief of The New York Times stated that Weisbrot along with his colleague Tariq Ali \\"have sent to a number of news organizations and websites\\" claims that were \\"full of indisputably false assertions\\". Rohter also says that Weisbrot manipulated data to give a positive image of Hugo Ch√°vez in the film South of the Border. Weisbrot defended his work saying that Rohter didn't find any inaccuracies and that Rohter \\"tried rather desperately\\" to find inaccuracies that no one would notice.

He was born at Nuremberg, and died at Jena. He studied philology, especially Oriental, and philosophy at Altdorf from 1664 to 1669, in which year he went to Jena and became a disciple of the celebrated Johannes Mus√§us, the representative of the middle party in the Syncretistic Controversy, whose daughter he married in 1674. Taking his doctor‚Äôs degree the same year, he became in 1675 professor of church history in the university, and lectured with great success on several different branches of theology. In 1682 he was chosen to represent the Protestant side in the negotiations with the papal legate Nicolas Steno, bishop of Titiopolis, for reunion of the Churches. He was three times rector at Jena before he was called by the elector Frederick III, in 1694, as professor and provisional rector to the new university of Halle. Here his devotion to strict orthodoxy brought him into conflict with some of his colleagues, and the pietistic movement also gave him trouble, so that after a year he was glad to accept the combined positions of chief court preacher, superintendent, and pastor at Weimar ‚Äî which, however, he held only a few months until his death. He left a name in the history of theology, especially by his dogmatic compendium, which still preserves the early Protestant traditions among High Lutherans, especially in America. The Jena theologians, and Johannes Musaeus in particular, had been asked by Ernest the Pious to draw up such a work, to take the place of the antiquated Hutter, and Mus√¶us urged his son-in-law to do it. The first edition appeared in 1686, the second, enlarged, in 1691, and it has been frequently reprinted since. It was commended for general use as a textbook by its method, its conciseness, and its absence of mere polemics. It was obviously, however, intended by its author as a vindication of the Jena theology, which had been sharply attacked from Wittenberg, and lay under some suspicion of syncretism. Its dependence upon Mus√¶us is really the distinguishing feature of the book, which is largely a compilation from him. Baier‚Äôs other works include polemical writings against Erbermann, a convert to Roman Catholicism and a Jesuit, and against the Quakers; and three other compendiums, published after his death (1698), one of exegetical, and one of moral theology, as well as one of the history of dogma. His read significance lies in the fact that he handed on and popularized the theology of Mus√¶us; and his work was continued by Buddeus, whom he left at Halle as professor of moral philosophy.

Clinically significant disorders that involve dysfunctions of the orexinergic projection system include narcolepsy, motility disorders or functional gastrointestinal disorders involving visceral hypersensitivity (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome), and eating disorders. The neurotransmitter glutamate and the endocannabinoids (e.g., anandamide) and the orexin neuropeptides orexin-A and orexin-B are the primary signaling neurochemicals in orexin neurons; pathway-specific neurochemicals include GABA, melanin- concentrating hormone, nociceptin, glucose, the dynorphin peptides, and the appetite-regulating peptide hormones leptin and ghrelin, among others. Notably, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is colocalized on orexinergic projection neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and many output structures, where the CB1 and orexin receptor 1 (OX1) receptors form the CB1‚ÄìOX1 receptor heterodimer. Figure 1: Schematic of brain CB1 expression and orexinergic neurons expressing OX1 or OX2 Figure 2: Synaptic signaling mechanisms in cannabinoid and orexin systems Figure 3: Schematic of brain pathways involved in food intake Inputs * Medial prefrontal cortex *Central nucleus of the amygdala Outputs The orexinergic projections from the lateral hypothalamus innervate the entirety of the remainder of the hypothalamus, with robust projections to the posterior hypothalamus, tuberomammillary nucleus (the histamine projection nucleus), the arcuate nucleus, and the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. In addition to the histaminergic nucleus, the orexin system also projects onto the ventral tegmental area dopamine nucleus, locus ceruleus noradrenergic nucleus, the serotonergic raphe nuclei, and cholinergic pedunculopontine nucleus and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. The histaminergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic nuclei which the lateral hypothalamic orexin neurons project onto constitute the primary components of the ascending reticular activating system. Other output regions include: the ventromedial hypothalamus, medial and lateral septal nuclei, central medial amygdala, zona incerta, periaqueductal gray matter, lateral habenula, diagonal band, substantia innominata (contains the nucleus basalis), stria terminalis, prefrontal cortex, various brain stem substructures, including the rostral ventromedial medulla, rostral ventrolateral medulla, nucleus ambiguus, solitary nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, pontine micturition center, ventral respiratory group, and pontine respiratory group), area postrema, and dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve. Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is colocalized on orexinergic projection neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and many output structures, where the CB1 and orexin receptor 1 (OX1) receptors physically and functionally join together to form the CB1‚ÄìOX1 receptor heterodimer. There is substantial anatomical and functional overlap and systemic cross-talk between the endocannabinoid system and orexin system within the central nervous system.  Function  Through the diverse outputs of the orexin system, the orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus mediate an array of functions. Two of the most commonly noted functions of orexin peptides in the lateral hypothalamus are the promotion of feeding behavior and arousal (i.e., wakefulness). More generally, the orexinergic neural projections of the lateral hypothalamus are involved in thermoregulation, regulating gastrointestinal motility and gastrointestinal function by way of the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve, reducing pain and nociception through several output structures (e.g., periaqueductal gray matter), modulating the rewarding property of stimuli through the ventral tegmental area projections and other outputs in the reward system, regulating energy homeostasis and neuroendocrine functions (e.g., HPA axis, HPG axis, and HPT axis) through other hypothalamic outputs, and regulating visceral functions (e.g., respiration, blood pressure, and micturition) via a group of structures in the brain stem, among other functions. The endocannabinoid system and the orexin system mediate many of the same cognitive and physical effects, and a significant overlap in their function and localization has been noted in a 2013 medical review; the receptor heterodimer produces a 100-fold amplification of the potency of the orexin receptor 1-mediated ERK pathway signaling. Unique functional interactions have been noted as well, such as an OX1-induced CB1 pressor response in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. Clinical significance Narcolepsy is associated with a marked reduction in the number of orexinergic projection neurons from the lateral hypothalamus and very low orexin peptides in cerebrospinal fluid. This has been identified as the mechanism responsible for narcoleptic symptoms. Evidence suggest that OX1 neurons that synapse onto the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and parts of the brain stem may play a role in the pathophysiology of chronic pain and visceral hypersensitivity in functional gastrointestinal disorders.

Krohn (born January 29, 1945) is an Orthodox Jewish rabbi, mohel, author, and lecturer on topics related to ethics and spiritual growth. He is the author of the bestselling \\"Maggid\\" series of books for ArtScroll, inspired by the stories of Rabbi Sholom Schwadron, who was known as the \\"Maggid of Jerusalem\\". He also authored a seminal work on brit milah (religious circumcision), also published by ArtScroll. Early life Krohn was born in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. His father, Rabbi Avrohom Zelig Krohn, was a mohel (ritual circumcisor), of whom there were many in Brooklyn. He decided to build a practice in Queens and found a job in a hospital there. He moved his family to Kew Gardens when Paysach was seven years old. Paysach was one of the leaders of the Kew Gardens Pirchei boys choir. Relationship with Rav Sholom Schwadron Krohn is well known as the author of a series of \\"Maggid\\" books inspired by the stories of Rabbi Sholom Schwadron, who was known as the \\"Maggid of Jerusalem\\" for the inspirational mussar talks he gave every Friday night from 1952 to 1992 to the public at the Zikhron Moshe shtiebel in Jerusalem. Krohn met Schwadron when his father invited Schwadron to stay with them during one of his frequent fund-raising trips to America in late 1964, although Schwadron didn't know him or his family personally. Schwadron insisted on paying rent, which Krohn agreed to reluctantly. During the five months that Schwadron resided with the Krohns, a close bond formed between him and the family. When Schwadron announced that he was leaving after Passover 1965 to travel back to Israel by boat, the entire family saw him off at the pier. Then Krohn's father handed Schwadron an envelope containing all the \\"rent money\\" he had paid, as he had never intended to keep it. A few days later, Krohn's father said he missed his guest so much that he decided to greet him when his boat docked in Israel. He and his wife quickly arranged passports and flew to Israel two days before Schwadron arrived. After giving the Schwadron family time for a reunion, the Krohns appeared with their own welcome.Krohn, The Maggid Speaks, pp. 29-30. Avrohom Zelig Krohn was diagnosed with a terminal illness after this event, and died the following year. Six months after that, the family received a letter from Schwadron saying that he was coming to America again. Schwadron became a surrogate father to Krohn's seven orphans.Krohn, The Maggid Speaks, pp. 30-31. He showed great sensitivity towards Krohn's widow, remembering his own mother's struggles to raise her orphaned children.Donn, Yochonon. \\"The Maggid of Jerusalem: 10 Years Since His Passing\\". Hamodia, 13 December 2007, pp. C6-C7. With Schwadron's encouragement and active input, Paysach Krohn penned the first of his popular \\"Maggid\\" books, The Maggid Speaks, published in 1987.Krohn, The Maggid Speaks, p. 14. Schwadron died before the publication of the second book in the series, The Maggid Speaks II. Subsequent titles (Along the Maggid's Journey, In the Footsteps of the Maggid, Echoes of the Maggid, Reflections of the Maggid etc.) memorialized Schwadron's influence on the overall project. As of 2012, Krohn has published eight books in the series. Mohel Krohn is a fifth-generation mohel. At age 21, he was the youngest mohel ever certified by the Brith Milah Board of New York. He has performed thousands of religious circumcisions. His ceremonies have been described as \\"exceptionally spiritual and inspirational\\". Other activities Krohn is a lecturer, sharing stories in the manner of a maggid and also collecting stories for his speeches and books. He also leads Jewish historical tours throughout Europe, speaking about the rich and vibrant Jewish communities that existed prior to World War II. He documented the first of these trips in his 2007 book, Traveling with the Maggid. Along with Esther Jungreis, Krohn has served as a guest speaker at the annual Shavuot retreat hosted by Gateways since 2005. In December 2004 Krohn launched the organization PaL (Phone and Learn) in the United Kingdom. A division of Partners in Torah in the U.S., PaL matches up Jews who want to learn more about their heritage with a friendly, knowledgeable tutor for up to an hour a week of Jewish study and discussion over the phone.

The area is bounded by the edge of Luton to the north, Bramingham Road to the south, Spinney Wood and the path from the wood to the edge of Luton to the west, and Great Bramingham wood to the east.  Etymology  The estate takes its name from the farm that owned much of the land that eventually became the estate. Marsh Farm was located by Leagrave Marsh and part of the old farmland is now Leagrave Park. History The estate was built in the late 1960s, with a mixture of flats and houses as part of the post-war expansion of Luton, mostly for overspill population rehoused from London. The estates at Farley Hill, Hockwell Ring and Stopsley were all built at about the same time. The council-owned tower blocks that dominate the estate are called Lea Bank, Penhill and Five Springs, each is of a similar design and are 15 floors each reaching a total height of .  Local area  = The Purley Centre = The Purley Centre was a council-owned shopping centre that contained the Marsh Farm Library and local business, such as supermarkets, a pub named The Purley Tavern and restaurants, and a multi- storey block of flats adjacent. It was the host of a marketplace that took place on Thursdays and Saturdays; it was opposite Marsh Farm House, a former factory-turned local community centre. = Transport = Marsh Farm is well connected by bus with regular services to Luton Town Centre. The estate benefits from the M1 as well as connections to the A6. Luton Airport is within 7 miles. Leagrave railway station is a 20-minute walk from Marsh Farm and there are frequent trains to Luton, St Albans, Bedford, London, Brighton and Sevenoaks. Arriva run their 24, 25 and 27 services through the estate, whilst Centrebus provide connections with their faster 'top10' service to the Town Centre. =Local schools and education= Primary Schools * Waulud Primary School, Wauluds Bank Drive * Whitefield Primary Academy, Stockholm Way Secondary schools * Lea Manor High School and community college, Northwell Drive * Lealands High School, Sundon Park Road * Woodlands Secondary School, Northwell Drive Library * Marsh Farm Library, Lea Manor High School = Religion = The estate lies within the ecclesiastical benefice of The Holy Cross, Marsh Farm and is served by the Parish Church of the Holy Cross (Church of England) built in 1976 and located in the centre of the estate adjacent to the medical centre on Purway Close. The Parish is registered with Forward in Faith and is Anglo-Catholic in its theology and worship. The Roman Catholic Church of The Holy Family is located off Northwell Drive and is one of the largest parishes in the Diocese of Northampton. During the season of Lent both Churches join together in the Stations of the Cross.  Local refurbishment  Marsh Farm made national news in July 1995 when the social problems boiled over into three days of rioting. Although local police received the help of the Metropolitan Police riot squad to bring the situation under control, it was the rave organisers Exodus Collective who brought the riots to an end by staging an impromptu party out of town which drew 2,000 young people from the area and calmed them down. The riots also resulted in a policeman being stabbed, all of the estate's public buildings being vandalised or set alight, cars were stolen and then set alight by joyriders as young as 12. A less notorious riot also occurred on the estate in July 1992. Whilst many parts of the estate still look like a typical 1960s development, the estate has ¬£32m of European money available for re-development and plans were created by the local council and other interested parties. Councillor Tom Shaw later said that he hoped it would remove the media's memories of Marsh Farm's anti-social past: \\"The bad reputation - people keep on talking about that [...] That was 25 years ago. People who live on Marsh Farm, love Marsh Farm;\\" and Mark Peasey the divisional director added: \\"[the riots were] a long, long time ago [...] We are developing skills for local people and we can leave a legacy behind [with people] continuing to work in the construction industry[.]\\" In the summer of 1999, some regeneration money was used to fund murals on the underpasses around the estate. The lead artist, Viv McIntyre, visited schools on the estate and carried out workshops with the pupils, where they provided the images (based on given themes) to create the mural designs. A team of artists then worked with the children to transfer the designs from paper to the walls. Work was halted until the 2010s, in which tenants were relocated, and old homes were demolished and rebuilt, notably The Purley Centre between 2017 and 2018, which was replaced by houses, a new row of stores, low rise apartments and recreation space. Marsh Farm Library was relocated to Lea Manor High School, which received its own refurbishment between 2009 and 2011. The three tower blocks received sprinkler systems after concerns were raised during the Grenfell Tower fire and blue cladding is being added around the sides. Politics Marsh Farm makes up the Northwell ward is represented by Cllr Roy Davis (Labour) and Cllr Don Worlding (Labour).

Mostly from Southern Africa, they also occur throughout the drier parts of Africa as far north as the Arabian peninsula. Description Cotyledon leaves (Cotyledon orbiculata) Cotyledon flower (Cotyledon orbiculata) Members of the genus are shrublets, generally succulent, with fleshily woody, brittle stems and persistent succulent leaves. The leaves are opposite. Leaf pairs generally are oriented at 90 degrees to their preceding and following pairs, as is common in the family Crassulaceae, but the leaf habit differs from say Tylecodon (in which the leaves are borne in spirals and are deciduous). The flowers are pendulous and tubular, borne at the tips of stout, rather long peduncles, mainly in short cymes. Calyx 5-partite, corolla 5-lobed. Petals united in a tube or urn that generally is longer than broad, their triangular tips more or less pointed and recurved, 10 stamens arising from corolla near base and projecting or nearly projecting from the corolla. Gynoecium comprises 5 carpels, nearly or quite free, each carpel tapering into a slender style with an obliquely capitate stigma. Each carpel contains many small (typically less than 1 milligramme when ripe) globular, brown seeds. Taxonomy Until the 1960s there were about 150 species described as being in the genus Cotyledon. However, since then it has been split into at least Adromischus, Dudleya, Rosularia, and Tylecodon, leaving probably less than two dozen species in Cotyledon. Of these, about four are characteristically fynbos plants. Cultivation and uses Most plants in the genus, and those that used to be included in the genus Cotyledon, are poisonous, even dangerously so. Some have been implicated in stock losses among goats, pigs and poultry. However, many species have long been used in traditional medicine. They have been applied for many purposes, ranging from magic charms to removal of corns. Cotyledon spp. are grown as garden and indoor subjects, practically independent of irrigation in all but full desert conditions, though they cannot survive poor light or bad drainage. Pests that affect them include sucking bugs, members of the suborder Auchenorrhyncha such as the mealy bug (Pseudococcus), and similar insects. The inflorescences of the larger species are sometimes used as components of dried arrangements in floral design.

Since 1996, it has been part of the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area. Although still an island by name, Deer Island has been connected to the mainland since the former Shirley Gut channel, which once separated the island from the town of Winthrop, was filled in by the 1938 New England hurricane. Today, Deer Island is the location of the Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant, whose egg-like sludge digesters are major harbor landmarks. Wastewater treatment plant, water tower, Deer Island The island has a permanent size of , plus an intertidal zone of a further . Two-thirds of the island's area is taken up with the wastewater plant, which treats sewage from 43 nearby cities and towns, and is the second-largest such plant in the United States. The remainder of the island is park land surrounding the treatment plant, and offers walking, jogging, sightseeing, picnicking, and fishing.

Over the years, Deer Island has had several different uses. During King Philip's War (also known as Metacomet's War) in the 1670s, it was used as a place of internment.

During the winter of 1675-76, between 500 and 1,100 American Indians were held on the island, and without adequate food or shelter and because of exposure to harsh winter weather, many died. Some, such as the medicine man, Tantamous, escaped Deer Island only to be recaptured later. =19th-20th century= Almshouse, Deer Island, 1851 In the middle of the 19th century, the island was the landing point for thousands of refugees from the Great Famine of Ireland, many sick and poverty-stricken. In 1847, a hospital was established to treat incoming immigrants, and during the following two years, about 4,800 men, women, and children were admitted. Many recovered and went on to new lives, but more than 800 died. In 1850, an almshouse was built to house paupers.

In his book A Short History of Nearly Everything, Bill Bryson mentions an experiment done at the military prison on Deer Island. Following the August 1918 flu pandemic, in an attempt to develop a vaccine, 62 volunteers were selected from 300 prisoners. These men were promised pardons if they survived a set of tests. None of the volunteers fell sick, but the ward doctor contracted the disease and died. The prisoners possibly became immunized due to exposure to the virus during the weeks preceding the trial, experiencing few symptoms or none at all.American Heritage, \\"The Great Swine Flu Epidemic of 1918\\", June 1976, p. 82 (n.b. article has no verifiable sources) The doctor in charge of the experiment, Joseph Goldberger, published a report on the experiment in 1921. His report mentions the volunteers coming from a naval facility on Deer Island, but nothing regarding prisoners or pardoning of sentences. Two separate entities existed on Deer Island for naval facilities and correctional facilities: Fort Dawes and the House of Correction. Goldberger's final report mentions two experiments on Deer Island at different times (November to December 1918 and February to March 1919), as well as a third in San Francisco (November to December 1918).United States Public Health Service, Joseph Goldberger.

The first sewage-treatment plant was constructed on Deer Island in the late 19th century and expanded in the 1960s. The current plant dates from the 1990s. Deer Island has been connected to the mainland since the New England Hurricane of 1938. A lighthouse was erected just offshore from the island in 1890; it was replaced by a modern tower in 1984. Modern recreational uses Deer Island is a popular recreation destination. A hiking/biking trail encircles the island, which is reachable by car, bus, or sea. A public boat dock is at the southwest corner of the island. Trails also climb escarpments on the island, including the highest one near the water tower. This vantage point offers views of the city, ocean, and Logan International Airport and is a popular spot for planespotting. The southern tip of the island offers some of the best views from land of the Boston harbor islands. Incidents In June 2015, the body of an unknown toddler girl, later identified as Bella Bond, was found on the island. Due to the state of decomposition, investigators were not immediately able to determine the age, sex, or ethnicity of the body.

It was released on Stones Throw Records in 2006. Oh No produced the album using only samples from Galt MacDermot. Oh No started working on the album when Stones Throw's manager Eothen \\"Egon\\" Alapatt asked him to compose two tracks for his series called Fan Club 45s, but Oh No instead recorded 27 beats in three days. Overall he made around 50 beats for the album, and was planning to split them into two albums. Critical reception Exodus Into Unheard Rhythms received favorable reviews from the music critics. Peter Macia of Pitchfork praised the album, saying that \\"Oh No gracefully layers these compositions the way MacDermont did with his own, fusing inspirations with the same wide-eyed gusto and ending up with the same kind of buoyant and elegant songs\\". Nathan Rabin, writing for The A.V. Club, called the album \\"a typically eccentric project for [Stones Throw]\\" that \\"finds [...] Oh No transforming the vast archive of Hair composer Galt McDermott into kaleidoscopic beats\\". AllMusic reviewer John Bush wrote that the album sounds better than the previous Oh No's album, but the production still outshines the lyrics. Del F. Cowie of Exclaim! called the album \\"a loose, refreshing and invigorating affair\\" and noted the \\"ear-grabbing production\\". Eric Solomon from Prefix praised the instrumentals, which he called \\"as funky as you might expect\\", but also criticized some of the guest performances. Andrew Matson of RapReviews ended his review saying that \\"the crowning achievement is that Oh No has not only made a great album, but also paved the way for rap fans to get into music that they might not check out normally\\".

The community is almost exclusively Native American, and a permit is required from the Navajo Nation for off-road travel in that area. During the time of the Old West, this area was frequented by notable western characters, such as Commodore Perry Owens. Navajo Springs was a stopping place for travelers to water their horses and themselves. The Beale Wagon Road, a precursor of the transcontinental railroad built through the area in 1882 as well as the \\"mother road\\", U.S. Route 66, (now Interstate 40) ran through Navajo Springs. The Arizona territorial government was organized here, and later a monument at the springs was erected to commemorate the event. At the insistence of the Santa Fe Railway company, all Navajos were forcibly moved away from the Navajo Springs area, and by the 1930s, all allotted lands within the area were extinguished and the lands forcibly vacated. But by the late 1980s, the lands were once again occupied by Navajos, this time by Navajo \\"refugees\\" from the Navajo-Hopi land dispute.  History  Navajo Springs was first noted by white men when Lt. Amiel W. Whipple passed through in 1853 and observed a \\"fine pool of water which breaks through the surface of the valley\\". Later, on September 1, 1857, Lt. Edward Fitzgerald Beale found Whipple's trail while scouting for a wagon road to be used by emigrants. At this point, Navajo Springs began to develop as a rest stop for travelers heading further west. In 1863, it was designated an official route by Major G. B. Willis. On December 27, 1863, the first gubernatorial party for Arizona crossed from New Mexico to Arizona. However, as they were unsure as to where the border between the states was, they proceeded to Navajo Springs, where on the 29th the first territorial governor of Arizona, John Noble Goodwin, was sworn in by Richard Cunningham McCormick, the first secretary of the territory and Goodwin's eventual successor.

A test stamp is a label resembling a postage stamp that is used by postal authorities for testing equipment. They generally have the same size and shape as regular stamps, but with a minimal design. Although not normally made available to the general public, some have found their way into private hands, and they are a recognised stamp collecting speciality. Test stamps are a form of cinderella stamp and in the United States are also commonly referred to as dummy stamps.Glossary of Terms for the Collector of United States Stamps. United States Stamp Society, 2012. Retrieved 5 July 2013. Archived here. In some countries there may be cross- over between test and training stamps but while test stamps do not need any stated value, training stamps are often produced in a variety or values or are genuine stamps cancelled by bars as this assists with the training process.  France  In France, test stamps have been used since 1849. There are about 40 different series, containing 600 references, in booklets, coils or simple sheets. The most popular series are \\"Bernard Palissy\\" or \\"Pic Vert\\".They are described in the \\"Catalogue des Vignettes Exp√©rimentales\\" by G√©rard Gomez (6th edition 2018)  Germany  In Germany test stamps were used between 1915 and 1930 to show advertisers in stamp booklets what their advertisement would look like. Small series of booklets were produced with large coloured numbers instead of the stamps for this purpose. These booklets are now very rare.  The United Kingdom  Two British \\"Poached Egg\\" test stamps.

The Stamp Collector's Encyclopaedia. 6th edition. London: Stanley Paul, 1966, p. 236. They were printed in the same size and format as the definitive stamps of the U.K. and perforated in the same manner. The amount of ink used was also the same as actual postage stamps, so that they could be used to test the machines with material as close as possible to actual postage stamps. The colour of these test stamps was changed from green to black after 1937 when some test coils were accidentally left in a machine and used as half-penny stamps. At the time of this colour change, text was also added to the centre of the labels indicating their use. The stamps are no longer in use. The United States The United States has made extensive used of test stamps with many different types issued over the years. The stamps have typically been made up into coils.Youngblood, Wayne L.

Kinnigoli is a fast developing hamlet. Kinnigoli is well connected by road with buses to all major cities and towns of the region. It is a central market place for surrounding villages like Kateel, Damaskatte, Kirem, Aikala, Pakshikere, Kateel, Punaroor, Ullanje, Kilenjoor, S.Kodi, Kenchanakere, Elinje, Sankalakariya, Patte, Guthakadu, Balkunje, Kavathar, Karnire, Nadugodu, Kemral, Shibarooru, Kammaje, Shimanthoor,Kerekad, Niddodi, Kudripadav, Neerude, Muchuru, Talipady, Mundkur and Sacheripete. A weekly market is held on every Thursday. Kinnigoli has got its own supermarket called Daily Needs equipped with fruits, vegetables, pulses, grains, frozen foods, juices, etc. The majority of the people in Kinnigoli work in agriculture. Paddy is the widely grown crop and is mostly grown for consumption rather than sale. Cash crops like Areca nut and cashew are grown in small packets of agricultural land or on uncultivable hillocks. Mango, jackfruit and tamarind trees are scattered over the farm lands. Kinnigoli is undergoing urbanisation and a real estate boom due to an influx of Indian expatriates returning to Kinnigoli (mostly from Persian Gulf countries). Kinnigoli has a hospital called Concetta Hospital which is run by the Bethany Sisters of the Little Flower, Mangalore. The famous Indian philanthropist and cardiac surgeon Dr Devi Prasad Shetty was born in Kinnigoli.

The other facet for which Kinnigoli is known for is its \\"Unity and diversity\\". Despite the presence of various religious groups like Hindus, Christians& Muslims and proliferations of Kanarese, Tulu, Konkani, and Beary languages, Kinnigoli has been free from any communal tension over the years. Each of the communities coexist very well and in some cases actively encourage and participate in the religious activities of the other. Due to the fact that a sizeable number of Kinnigoli natives are Indian expatriates working abroad particularly in the Gulf countries, there has been a large influx of foreign remittances to the small town. So nowadays, one can find a large number of upscale mansions and bungalows along the roads leading in and out of kinnigoli. However, despite the real estate boom, the ecosystem has been carefully preserved by taking care to see that trees are not destroyed and overall green cover remains untouched. As a result, the place still retains its green cover and eco friendly habitat. Some modern apartments have come up at Kinnigoli like Pinto's Golden Castle . Kinnigoli has few options of hotels.

He received his bachelor's degree in history after only 18 months of study by combining CLEP examinations with studies at five different universities simultaneously. He earned a liberal arts degree from Yeshiva University of New York. He has studied at the Mir Yeshiva in Jerusalem for more than three decades. He received rabbinic ordination from the previous Rav of the Kotel, Rabbi Meir Yehuda Getz. He and his wife, Aidel, reside in the Arzei HaBira neighborhood of Jerusalem.Rabin, Miriam. \\"Traveling to Inspire: The Yated speaks with Rabbi Hanoch Teller\\". Yated Ne'eman, 30 September 2012, pp. 104‚Äì105. Retrieved 5 November 2012. Author Teller began his writing career in 1977 when he submitted an article to The Jewish Observer and Moment magazine about his encounter with American college students in Kiryat Shmona, whose program bypassed the traditional religious and cultural centers of Israel in favor of community service in a development town. In the beginning he wrote under the pen name Abba Eidelman. He has also written for the Jewish Women's Outlook and The Jerusalem Post. He received the My Jerusalem Prize of 5742 (1982) in an international essay competition marking the fifteenth anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem. His first series of books in the mid-1980s, Once Upon a Soul, Souled! and Soul Survivors, introduced the genre of true, contemporary stories promoting the themes of hashgacha pratis (Divine Providence) and human kindness. Teller later branched out into biographies of contemporary Orthodox Jewish personalities ‚Äî such as Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (whose shiur he attended for 14 years), Rabbi Levi Yitzchak Horowitz (the Bostoner RebbeGoldberg, Ann. \\"Behind the Bestsellers\\". Religious Life in Jerusalem supplement, The Jerusalem Post, 20 August 1993, p. 2.), Baltimore Torah day school principal Rabbi Binyamin Steinberg, Toronto philanthropist Joseph Tanenbaum, and Mir rosh yeshiva Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel (under whom he studied for over 30 years) ‚Äî using anecdotes to convey moral and ethical lessons. A large section of his corpus presents stories on specific ethical concepts, such as judging others favorably (Courtrooms of the Mind), integrity (Above the Bottom Line), and avoiding argumentation and strife (Give Peace a Stance). He is known for the high-level vocabulary and witty turns of phrase that he employs in his writing. Several of his books have been translated into Hebrew, Russian, and Spanish. Teller also works closely with graphic designers of his book covers; the cover of Heroic Children: Untold Stories of the Unconquerable (2015) received the 2016 Ben Franklin Book Award from the Independent Book Publishers Association in the category of nonfiction cover design. Lecturer Teller's teaching career began as a result of his first article about the American college students in northern Israel, which attracted the interest of the directors of the newly created women's division at Ohr Somayach. His folksy and entertaining style, combined with his anecdotal stories of Gedolim (Torah leaders), made him a popular instructor at the Ohr Somayach women's division and other English-speaking Jerusalem seminaries for American students. He is currently a faculty member at Michlelet Mevaseret Yerushalayim College of Jewish Studies for Women, Darchei Binah Women's School, Afikei Torah Women's School for Advanced Torah Studies, Midreshet Moriah, Michlala-Jerusalem College, Bnot Torah Institute, Neve Yerushalayim, and Naaleh Online Torah School. He is also an instructor at Yeshivat Hakotel for men. Teller has made over 100 shidduchim among his students and other young people. Teller is an international speaker for schools, women's groups, synagogue functions, learning seminars, fundraising dinners, and organizational meetings in North America, Central America, South America, Europe, Israel, and Australia. In his talks, he teaches Torah topics interwoven with inspiring stories about Gedolim and other Jewish heroes. Teller is a senior docent at Yad Vashem, licensed to lead tours in its new Holocaust Memorial Museum. His tours combine his knowledge of the events and lessons of the Holocaust with stories describing the experiences of individual victims. He has produced an eleven-part CD lecture series on this subject, titled Comprehending the Incomprehensible: The History, Heroism and Lessons of the Holocaust. Producer In 1996 Teller produced a docudrama exploring miracles in everyday life (Do You Believe in Miracles?) which was seen by over 70,000 people in Jewish community centers, synagogues, and other venues around the globe. In March 2012 he released a documentary about the Hasidic master Elimelech of Lizhensk and the Hasidic legacy of brotherhood, which includes musical performances by Jewish music personalities Abish Brodt and Avraham Fried.Bachrach, Rachel. \\"The Master Storyteller Goes to the Movies\\".

The state park consists of of beach, dunes, restored salt marsh, open areas and woods as well as the bird sanctuary of Charles Island. The park offers swimming, picnicking, trails, boardwalks, and opportunities for bird-watching. It is managed by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. History The area includes the tidal channels of the Fletcher's Creek and Nettleton Creek watershed and had been a local dumping site and landfill from the 1920s until 1977. Soil analyses have indicated the presence of heavy metal pollutants, probably due to the area's use as a dump. Acquisition of the park land by the state began in 1955, after Hurricane Diane destroyed 75 homes on the site. Once the last acquisitions were made, the park became a reality in 1960. In 1997, a project to restore the coastal wetlands along Silver Sands was approved. The park was renovated according to plans begun in 1990 by architect Alfredo De Vido and completed in 2000. Features During low tide, visitors can walk across the tombolo to Charles Island, except from May through August when the island's nesting birds are left undisturbed. The wooded interior of Charles Island is protected for heron and egret rookeries. It is one of the largest wading bird rookeries in the state. The ruins of a Catholic retreat from the 1920s remain on the island. Popular belief says the island is the site of Captain Kidd's buried treasure. The park lies adjacent to the city-owned Walnut Beach, to which it is connected by boardwalk. A boardwalk with railings extends from the parking lot to the beach (about 200 ft) and also runs along part of the beach. The land alongside the boardwalk had been used as a landfill. However, the salt water tidal marsh is being environmentally restored. Through the marsh, there are also remnants of the foundations of cottages that were destroyed by Diane. There is also an old dirt road that goes east‚Äìwest through the park. Park trails form segments of the East Coast Greenway. Many birds can be seen at the park. Least and common terns feed here. It is also a wintering area for raptors such as the rough-legged hawk, the snowy owl and the short-eared owl.

May Fourth Square () is a large public square in Qingdao's central business district. It is located between the new municipal government building and Fushan Bay and is composed of Shizhengting Square, the central square and the coastal park. Named after the nationwide protest May Fourth Movement that started in Qingdao, the square is best recognized by the large \\"May Wind\\" () sculpture near the seaside. The square is a popular tourist destination, and is bordered by the city government to the north, the sea to the south, and residential and commercial buildings on either side.

The light show to celebrate Chinese Mid-autumn festival was put on the buildings across the sea of the May Fourth Square.  History of May Fourth Square  The May 4th Movement () was sparked by Article 156 of the Treaty of Versailles which transferred German concessions in Shandong including Qingdao to Japan rather than returning sovereign authority to China. Chinese outrage over this provision ignited mass student demonstrations in Beijing on May 4th, 1919 which resulted in the cultural movement known today as the May Fourth Movement. The May 4th Movement influenced the Chinese delegation not to sign the Treaty of Versailles. China declared the end of its war against Germany in September 1919 and signed a separate treaty in 1921.

Her work covers hacker culture, Anonymous, Occupy movement, intellectual property and copyright issues, and the Internet.  Early life and education  Quinn Norton was born in May 1973. She grew up in a poor family. Her father's struggles with his experience post-Vietnam and his drug-related incarceration inspired her to write later about judicial reform and restorative justice. Norton completed a GED and attended Orange Coast Community College. She sporadically sat in on classes at University of California, Los Angeles and University of California, Santa Barbara but was never formally enrolled.  Career  Norton began her professional life as a technologist when she worked as a SysAdmin and web programmer. In 2006, she shifted to journalism. Her focus was initially on technology but eventually grew to encompass internet activism. In 2006, Norton described a conceptual prank called Quinn's Prank / Quinn's Symphonic Conundrum involving writing and executing a computer program that would output all possible melodies, theoretically providing the opportunity to claim copyright for all music. Norton's work has appeared in Wired, where she spent a year embedded with Occupy Wall Street. She contributed regularly to the Wired blog, Threat Level, which focused on digital security. From 2013 to 2014, she wrote a column, Notes on a Strange World, at Medium. She wrote articles for Maximum PC magazine for five years and has published in The Guardian, ProPublica, Gizmodo, and O'Reilly Media publications such as Make magazine. She was a long-time participant at O'Reilly's Foo Camp. Norton has spoken extensively on various aspects of technology, history and culture.[\\"Life in the Invisible City\\": Quinn Norton talk at Goldsmiths JULY 18, 2016] From 2006 to 2008, she gave talks at technology conferences about body augmentation, usually under the title \\"Body Hacking.\\" In connection with this work, Norton taught a course at NYU titled \\"Laboratory of the Self.\\" As part of her research, Norton had a magnet implanted in the tip of her ring finger, enabling her to sense magnetic fields. The magnet was later removed. In 2018, The New York Times announced Norton as its new lead opinion writer covering technology. The hire drew sharp criticism focused on tweets Norton wrote between 2013 and 2017, particularly use of slurs referring to gay people and her defense of her friendship with Andrew Auernheimer, a hacker and white supremacist known as weev. Later that day, she and the Times announced she would not join the paper after all; the Times said it had been unaware of her comments. Calling the episode an example of \\"context collapse\\", and describing herself as a member of the LGBT community, Norton said her use of slurs had been specific to the context of engaging with the language of hackers. She also said her friendship with Auernheimer (with whom she was no longer in contact) had been an effort to discourage his racism. The incident led to debate over the ethics of free speech in the hacking community at large as well as Times social media policy.  Advocacy  Norton is an advocate of encryption when communicating electronically. In 2009, she opposed the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA). Norton describes herself as an anarchist and a queer activist. = Aaron Swartz = On March 3, 2011, Norton was subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury regarding an investigation of her then-partner Aaron Swartz that led to the case United States v. Swartz. She ultimately accepted a proffer agreement with the prosecutor, whereby she shared information about the Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto, which defendant Aaron Swartz either wrote or co-wrote. The document offered the prosecution additional evidence in their case against Swartz. Articles in The Atlantic and in New York Magazine indicate that in 2011 Norton was pressured by prosecutors to offer information or testimony that could be used against Aaron Swartz in his trial for fraud for downloading thousands of academic articles from behind a paywall, but that she denied having information that supported prosecutors' claims of criminal intentions on Swartz's part. Prosecutors nevertheless attempted to use a public blog post on Swartz's blog that Norton mentioned, which may or may not have been co-authored by Swartz, as proof of a criminal intent. = Robert Scoble = In October 2017, Norton wrote a piece about Robert Scoble that described an alleged sexual assault by Scoble on Norton as well as another woman. Scoble denied what turned out to be multiple claims of assault, and said they were the result of his struggle with alcoholism. His response was met with a critical reaction.  Personal life  Norton was married to journalist Danny O'Brien. They have a daughter. The marriage ended in divorce. Norton dated computer programmer and activist Aaron Swartz for roughly three years, from 2007 until early 2011. In 2016, Norton moved to Luxembourg to live with the man she eventually married in 2017.

Early development  Walker was born into a musical family in Shaw, Lancashire, England. His father played trombone in an amateur brass band, and his mother was an amateur soprano. A choirboy in the parish church, he continued his musical studies when he went to work in a cotton mill on leaving school. By the age of fifteen and a half he already had a deep bass voice, which he used at the evening institute where he studied harmony. At the age of 17 he made his first public performance as a soloist in a concert programme including Handel arias. When he was eighteen he was heard by Mrs Percy Pitt, wife of the conductor, and went to Laurence Lee for a year's training. While still working in a cotton mill he began to appear in Gilbert and Sullivan productions and other light opera.  College, Guildhall and film roles  He won a scholarship to the Royal Manchester College of Music in 1929, and studied singing there for three years under Richard Evans. He took parts in college opera productions, notably The Magic Flute, and won the Curtis Gold Medal. Walker was then keen to go to London. He sang for Landon Ronald, and was awarded the Heilbut Major scholarship to the Guildhall School of Music, where he studied with the tenor Walter Hyde. In their production of Autumn Crocus he was heard by Basil Dean, who engaged him for films such as Java Head, Sing As We Go and Look up and Laugh (with Gracie Fields), and Whom the Gods Love (a film about the life of Mozart).  Concert, broadcast, and Covent Garden  Norman Walker's first appearance with the Hall√© Orchestra and Choir was in the Bach Mass in B minor in 1933. The first of many oratorio performances, this led to an appearance in the Verdi Requiem at the Queen's Hall for the Royal Philharmonic Society under Thomas Beecham in 1935. In the same year he made his first important radio broadcast, and first appeared in the international seasons at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. After two years or so in minor roles, he sang the roles of King Mark in Tristan und Isolde, Gurnemanz in Parsifal and the Commendatore in Don Giovanni.New Grove, 1090. He also took the role of the King in Verdi's Aida in a cast including Beniamino Gigli.  The War and after  In 1941 he was commissioned in the RAF and served as a Flying Control Officer until demobilised as a Flight Lieutenant in November 1945. During that time he received a Fellowship of the Royal Manchester College of Music (1941) and a Fellowship of the Guildhall School of Music in 1945. After the War he returned to Covent Garden in February 1948 and was a member of the Company for four seasons and appeared during the 1952/53 season as a guest. He was much admired as King Mark in Tristan und Isolde and created the role of the Evangelist in the premi√®re of Ralph Vaughan Williams's The Pilgrim's Progress, and sang with Sadler's Wells Opera, Jay Pomeroy's company at the Cambridge Theatre and at Glyndebourne, but devoted himself increasingly to oratorio, including the major works of Bach, Handel and Elgar. He also gave BBC broadcasts of lieder. In 1952 he toured Australia and New Zealand. Walker suffered a stroke in 1955 and retired from singing on the stage but continued to broadcast. He taught at the Guildhall School of Music from 1951 until his death, his students including Ian Partridge, Elizabeth Bainbridge, Janet Coster, John Dobson, Anne Pashley, John Heddle Nash, Paschal Allen and Lawrence Richard. His son is the recording historian, magazine editor and discographer Malcolm Walker (born 16 May 1940).Walker, Malcolm. Lawrance Collingwood. Classical Recordings Quarterly. Summer 2014, No 77, p43.

The player must kill them with weapons or magical spells. The levels become progressively harder to survive as the player descends deeper and deeper into the dungeon.

It had numerous owners, most notably Chalk Beeson and gunfighter Luke Short. The establishment provided gambling and live entertainment, including Beeson's five-person orchestra. It was the scene of several altercations, shoot-outs, gunfights, and standoffs often associated with cattle towns in the American wild west. Most famous was the 1879 Long Branch Saloon Gunfight, in which Frank Loving killed Levi Richardson.  Origins  The Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City, Kansas, 1874 The saloon was built as the result of a wager between cowboys and soldiers playing ball. Bets were placed and if the cowboys beat the soldiers, the soldiers agreed to provide building materials to construct a saloon. Chalkley Beeson, a wealthy farmer and rancher, and William Harris bought the saloon in 1878. Harris named it after his hometown of Long Branch, New Jersey. It was a plain storefront bar with little ornamentation, typical for frontier saloons of the time. The saloon prospered until the railroad replaced the cattle drive. The establishment burned down in 1885 and was never rebuilt.  Entertainment  The saloon soon became the most popular and refined saloon in Dodge City. Beeson was a talented musician and led a five-piece orchestra that played nightly. The Long Branch served milk, tea, lemonade, sarsaparilla, and all types of alcohol including champagne and beer.The Long Branch Saloon ; retrieved March 11, 2010. Anheuser-Busch was the original beer served at the Long Branch. Drinks were kept cold in the winter with ice from the river; in the summer ice was shipped by train from the mountains of Colorado. Gambling ranged from five cent chuck-a-luck to thousand dollar poker. Chalkley \\"Chalk\\" Beeson, co-owner with William Harris of the Long Branch Saloon  Notable patrons  The saloon hosted many Old West characters including Clay Allison, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Frank Loving, Dave Mather, Town Marshal Charlie Bassett, and brothers Ed, James, and Bat Masterson.  Site of conflicts  The saloon was the site of a gunfight on April 5, 1879, between Frank Loving and Levi Richardson. Loving accused Richardson of making disrespectful advances towards his wife, and the two got into an argument that turned into a gunfight across a table. Loving was grazed on the hand by one bullet; Richardson was shot three times and died. Town Marshal Bassett arrested Loving, but on April 7, a coroner‚Ä≤s inquest ruled that Loving had acted in self-defense and he was released without charges. Professional gambler and gunfighter Short's purchase of a partial interest in the saloon in 1883 was credited as one of the causes of the bloodless Dodge City War.  In popular culture  A saloon using the same name was featured in almost every episode of the long-running radio and television drama, Gunsmoke. A new establishment named the Long Branch Saloon, largely based on Gunsmoke, was built as part of the modern non-profit Boot Hill Museum entertainment and exhibit theme park in Dodge City. The exterior was modeled on period photographs of the original building, while the interior is consistent with period saloons of the era. It is furnished with an 1881 bar and two Golden Eagles on top of the back bar that were once owned by Beeson.

His career as music producer, orchestrator and songwriter has scored five number one singles, 31 Top 20 singles and a string of platinum albums with recording artists as diverse as Madonna, Shakatak, Mezzoforte, Barbra Streisand, Boyzone, Sonia, Take That, Sinitta, Jos√© Carreras, Robson & Jerome, Michael Ball, Sarah Brightman, The Texas Tenors, Cliff Richard, Connie Fisher, Paul Potts, Andy Abraham and Ray Quinn. Wright's career in theatre and film include serving as the music producer for Andrew Lloyd Webber, in a successful partnership that had, as of May 2009, lasted more than eighteen years. Record production Wright first rose to prominence as producer of the jazz- funk group Shakatak. During the 1980s, he also produced medleys under various names. In 1981, Wright created \\"Ain't No Stopping\\", a rapid response to the success of Stars on 45 consisting of parts of recent disco hits and taking its name from McFadden & Whitehead's \\"Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now\\" which began and ended the medley. Released under the group name Enigma, it reached number 11 in the UK Singles Chart and was followed by \\"I Love Music\\" which reached number 25. Through the 1980s, Wright continued to produce medleys under other names including Mojo and Mirage. Under the latter name, he created the popular \\"Jack Mix\\" series of medleys which included the 1987 top ten hit singles \\"Jack Mix II\\" (#4) and \\"Jack Mix IV\\" (#8) and albums Jack Mix '88 and Jack Mix in Full Effect (both #7). He continued to create medleys into the early 1990s, now under the name UK Mixmasters. Under this title, he produced three UK hit singles, the biggest of these being \\"The Bare Necessities Megamix\\", which peaked at No. 14 in 1991.Official UK Charts ‚Äì UK Mixmasters =Mirage= Mirage was a British pop music group active in the 1980s and specializing in medleys. It achieved particular success in 1987‚Äì8 with the \\"Jack Mix\\" series of singles and LPs. Mirage had its origins in Enigma, a 1981 project created by Nigel Wright to cash in on the success of Dutch medley group Stars on 45. Enigma's \\"Ain't No Stopping\\", a medley of disco hits played by session musicians, was released while Stars on 45 was still climbing the charts. \\"Ain't No Stopping\\" peaked at number 11 in the UK singles chart and was followed up with \\"I Love Music\\", which peaked at number 25. Although the medley craze faded quickly, Wright continued to produce medleys, first under the name Mojo, before settling on Mirage. The first Mirage medley to make an impact was the 1984 release \\"Give Me The Night\\", a medley of George Benson songs sung by Leroy Osbourne (of Sade) under the guise of Roy Gayle. Other single-artist medleys followed: \\"Let's Groove\\" (Earth, Wind & Fire), \\"Get Down on It\\" (Kool & the Gang) and the Tracy Ackerman-fronted \\"Into The Groove Medley\\" (Madonna). Though popular in UK clubs, only \\"Give Me The Night\\" crossed over into the mainstream charts. Jack Mix Mirage came to much greater prominence in 1987 when Wright spotted an opportunity in the new house music style which was beginning to enter the mainstream. In January 1987, Steve \\"Silk\\" Hurley achieved the first house music number one hit in the UK with \\"Jack Your Body\\". Wright quickly responded by releasing the 12\\" single \\"Jack Mix\\" under the Mirage name ‚Äì a medley/montage of \\"Jack Your Body\\", \\"Showing Out (Get Fresh at the Weekend)\\" and \\"Axel F\\". Following positive response from the clubs, an expanded version was released, titled \\"Jack Mix II\\". This became the first UK-produced house record to reach the British top ten, peaking at number 4. Unlike most medleys, which typically used sections of individual songs presented sequentially with brief transitions between them, the \\"Jack Mix\\" series took a different approach, layering elements of different songs to produce a dense montage effect similar to a mashup. Despite being reliant entirely on medleys of other people's material, Mirage was one of the most successful house acts in 1987‚Äì8, placing several more singles on the charts, including the number eight hit \\"Jack Mix IV\\". Several TV advertised albums also charted, with the most successful being Jack Mix '88 (actually released in 1987) and Jack Mix in Full Effect, both of which reached number 7. Mirage's popularity faded in 1988, as a large number of British house music acts started to produce original material and sample-based records using the original recordings rather than session remakes.

It currently carries an all-news format. It has consistently been Cuba's number one radio station. Overview The station is heard on various AM frequencies throughout the country and also on certain FM frequencies, such as 101.5 FM in Havana. Radio Reloj started at 6am on 1 July 1947 and claims to be the first non-stop information channel in the world.  News broadcasting  The news item is read against a background sound of continuous clock ticks every second. Every minute there is a station name announcement, a beep on the minute, a time announcement and \\"RR\\" .-. .-. in Morse code. On the top and bottom of each hour, the main news headlines are broadcast for two minutes. Both Manu Chao and Vocal Sampling have recorded musical \\"tributes\\" to these background ticks, in the songs \\"Me Gustas T√∫\\" (\\"I like you\\") and \\"Radio Reloj\\", respectively. The station's unusual style has required the use of short expressions that avoids the divorce between the speaker's spoken word and the word written by the editor or the reporter. Editors (rotate every 6 hours) have to write 13-15 lines for sheets which is read by a voice only (using for chronicles, interviews and others), and 15-16 lines for those which is read by two voices (using for news bulletins and information programs). Another rule is that the news bulletin must finish in exactly 60 seconds or less. Because of this, it is not uncommon for the on-air journalist to fill the remaining time with so-called queues like important events and curious facts, nor is it for him/her to accelerate the reading speed to finish the news on time. Also, because of this, there's usually a corrector working at any shift to check the minutes that're going to air and corrects the content/writing errors to meet the requirements. If the news is not finished after the beep, the journalist must say the word CONTINUAR√Å to be able to continue, and if the news ends in the next minute, (s)he should say the word CONCLUSI√ìN at the end. The exact time (not just minute, but hour as well) is also included. Radio Reloj announces the time of 20 capital cities in the world every day at midday and midnight. Radio Reloj claims that it broadcasts 300 news items every day, more than 50% of Cuba and the rest of the world. On-air broadcasts Radio Reloj is always live 24 hours a day. There are usually two anchors during every news bulletin and each rotates every four hours. They don't normally finish their shift together. After one hour of reading news, the anchor has half an hour to rest. They will then come back and read another hour of news followed by a half an hour for resting. In a two-voice format, there are four paragraphs in each sheet of writing from editors. The first announcer reads the first and third paragraph, whilst the second announcer reads the second and fourth ones. Whilst one of the two main anchors is on the rest, a third anchor temporarily replaces them. This system is rotated for hours: an anchor stays for an hour as the first announcer, then they rotate to be the second announcer in the next hour. In a one-voice format, all information is read by the same announcer. Listenership outside of Cuba From its inception in 1947 until the Internet era, Radio Reloj was generally available only to listeners in Cuba; however, on occasion during a clear night (especially during the winter months), Radio Reloj could be heard in adjacent countries, and it generally has a good signal along the Florida Keys (from Islamorada to Key West) and some parts of Southwest Florida, due to this area being immediately north of Havana. A good example of DXing of Radio Reloj was on the morning of January 21, 1999 at 1:20am (Eastern Time), when US radio station WMCA, licensed in New York City and broadcasting on 570 AM (the same as Radio Reloj's Santa Clara signal), went off the air for transmitter maintenance. Once WMCA's carrier signal dropped, Radio Reloj's broadcast could be heard up and down the entire Eastern Seaboard of the United States including New York City, where WMCA originates its broadcasts.WMCA signs off for transmitter maintenance, Cuba's Radio Reloj can be heard 01-21-1999 (Clip at bottom of page) Radio Reloj is also available free in satellite broadcast in Hispasat 30¬∞ W.

Intended to serve as a liberation force for British-ruled India, it was made up of Indian prisoners of war and expatriates in Europe. Because of its origins in the Indian independence movement, it was known also as the \\"Tiger Legion\\", and the \\"Azad Hind Fauj\\". As part of the Waffen-SS it was known as the Indian Volunteer Legion of the Waffen-SS (). Indian independence leader Subhas Chandra Bose initiated the legion's formation, as part of his efforts to win India's independence by waging war against Britain, when he came to Berlin in 1941 seeking German aid. The initial recruits in 1941 were volunteers from the Indian students resident in Germany at the time, and a handful of the Indian prisoners of war who had been captured during the North Africa Campaign. It would later draw a larger number of Indian prisoners of war as volunteers. Though it was initially raised as an assault group that would form a pathfinder to a German‚ÄìIndian joint invasion of the western frontiers of British India, only a small contingent was ever put to its original intended purpose. A small contingent, including much of the Indian officer corps and enlisted leadership, was transferred to the Indian National Army in South-East Asia. The majority of the troops of the Indian Legion were only ever stationed in Europe in non-combat duties, in the Netherlands and in France until the Allied invasion. They saw action in the retreat from the Allied advance across France, fighting mostly against the French Resistance. One company was sent to Italy in 1944, where it saw action against British and Polish troops and undertook anti-partisan operations. At the time of the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945, the remaining men of the Indian Legion made efforts to march to neutral Switzerland over the Alps, but these efforts proved futile as they were captured by American and French troops and eventually shipped back to India to face charges of treason. Because of the uproar the trials of Indians who served with the Axis caused among civilians and the military of British India, the legion members' trials were not completed. Background The idea of raising an armed force that would fight its way into India to bring down the British Raj goes back to the First World War, when the Ghadar Party and the then nascent Indian Independence League formulated plans to initiate rebellion in the British Indian Army from Punjab to Hong Kong with German support. This plan failed after information leaked to British intelligence, but only after many attempts at mutiny, and a 1915 mutiny of Indian troops in Singapore. During World War II, all three of the major Axis Powers sought to support armed revolutionary activities in India, and aided the recruitment of a military force from Indian POWs captured while serving in the British Indian Army and Indian expatriates. The most famous and successful Indian force to fight with the Axis was the Indian National Army (INA) in southeast Asia, that came into being with the support of the Japanese Empire in April 1942. Fascist Italy also created the Azad Hindustan Battalion () in February 1942. This unit was formed from Indian POWs from their Centro I POW camp, and Italians previously resident in India and Persia, and ultimately served under the Ragruppamento Centri Militari alongside units of Arabs and colonial Italians. However, the effort had little acceptance from the Indians in the unit, who did not wish to serve under Italian officers. After the Italian loss at the Second Battle of El Alamein, the Indians mutinied when told to fight in Libya. Consequently, the remnants of the battalion were disbanded in November 1942. Although the Indian National Congress (INC), the organisation leading the struggle for Indian independence, had passed resolutions conditionally supporting the fight against fascism, some Indian public opinion was more hostile toward Britain's unilateral decision to declare India a belligerent on the side of the Allies. Among the more rebellious Indian political leaders of the time was Subhas Chandra Bose, a former INC president, who was viewed as a potent enough threat by the British that he was arrested when the war started. Bose escaped from house arrest in India in January 1941 and made his way through Afghanistan to the Soviet Union, with some help from Germany's military intelligence, the Abwehr. Bose, ideologically a Communist was inclined to the Soviet Union for aid. Once he reached Moscow, he did not receive the expected Soviet support for his plans for a popular uprising in India. The Soviets were navigating a complex geopolitical and strategic web and did not want to break any potential alliance with the Allies in case of an impending German invasion. The German ambassador in Moscow, Count von der Schulenberg, soon arranged for Bose to go to Berlin. He arrived at the beginning of April 1941, and he met with foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and later Adolf Hitler. In Berlin, Bose set up the Free India Centre and Azad Hind Radio, which commenced broadcasting to Indians on shortwave frequencies, reaching tens of thousands of Indians who had the requisite receiver. Soon Bose's aim became to raise an army, which he imagined would march into India with German forces and trigger the downfall of the Raj. Origin Derna, Libya, 1941. The first troops of the Indian Legion were recruited from Indian POWs captured at El Mekili, Libya during the battles for Tobruk. The German forces in the Western Desert selected a core group of 27 POWs as potential officers and they were flown to Berlin in May 1941, to be followed, after the Centro I experiment, by POWs being transferred from the Italian forces to Germany. The number of POWs transferred to Germany grew to about 10,000 who were eventually housed at Annaburg camp, where Bose first met with them. A first group of 300 volunteers from the POWs and Indians expatriates in Germany were sent to Frankenberg camp near Chemnitz, to train and convince arriving POWs to join the legion. As the numbers of POWs joining the legion swelled, the legion was moved to K√∂nigsbr√ºck for further training. It was at K√∂nigsbr√ºck that uniforms were first issued, in German feldgrau with the badge of the leaping tiger of Azad Hind. The formation of the Indian National Army was announced by the German Propaganda Ministry in January 1942. It did not, however, take oath until 26 August 1942, as the Legion Freies Indien of the German Army. By May 1943, the numbers had swelled, aided by the enlistment as volunteers of Indian expatriates. Overall, there were about 15,000 Indian POWs in Europe, primarily held in Germany by 1943. While some remained loyal to the King-Emperor and treated Bose and the Legion with contempt, most were at least somewhat sympathetic to Bose's cause. While approximately 2,000 became legionnaires, some others did not complete their training due to various reasons and circumstances. In total, the maximum size of the Legion was 4,500. Bose sought and obtained agreement from the German High Command for the rather remarkable terms by which the Legion would serve in German military. German soldiers would train the Indians in the strictest military discipline, in all branches of infantry in using weapons and motorized units, the same way a German formation was trained; the Indian legionnaires were not to be mixed with any German structures; they were not to be sent to any front other than in India for fighting against the British‚Äîbut would be allowed to fight in self-defence at any other place; and nonetheless in all other respects, the legionnaires would enjoy the same facilities and amenities regarding pay, clothing, food, leave, etc., as German soldiers. As for the unit's eventual deployments in the Netherlands and France, they were ostensibly for training purposes, according to Bose's plans for the unit to be trained in some aspects of coastal defence. After the invasion of France by the Allies, the unit was ordered back to Germany, so that it would not participate in fighting for German military interests. Organization =Composition= The British Indian Army organised regiments and units on the basis of religion and regional or caste identity. Bose sought to end this practice and build up one unified Indian identity among the men who would fight for independence. Consequently, the Indian Legion was organised as mixed units so that Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs all served side-by-side. Around the time of its formation in late 1942, 59% of the legion's men were Hindus, 25% were Muslims, 14% were Sikhs and 2% other religions. Relative to the British Indian Army, there were more Hindus and Sikhs, and fewer Muslims. The success of Bose's idea of developing a unified national identity was evident when Heinrich Himmler proposed in late 1943 (after Bose's departure) that the Muslim soldiers of the I.R. 950 be recruited into the new Handschar Division. The commander of the SS Head Office, Gottlob Berger, was obliged to point out that while the Bosnians of the \\"Handschar\\" perceived themselves as people of a European identity, Indian Muslims perceived themselves as Indians. Hitler, however, showed little enthusiasm for the I.R. 950, at one stage insisting that their weapons be handed over to the newly created 18th SS Horst Wessel Division, exclaiming that \\"‚Ä¶the Indian Legion is a joke!\\" =Uniform and standard= The uniform issued to the Indian Legion were the standard German Army uniform of feldgrau in winter and khaki in summer. Additionally, the troops wore on their right upper arm a specially designed arm badge in the shape of a shield with three horizontal stripes of saffron, white, and green and featuring a leaping tiger on the white middle band. The legend Freies Indien was inscribed in black featured on a white background above the tricolor. A saffron, white, and green transfer was also worn on the left side of their steel helmets, similar to the black, white, and red decal German soldiers wore on their helmets. Sikhs in the legion were permitted to wear a turban as dictated by their religion instead of the usual peaked field cap, of a colour appropriate to their uniform. The standard of the Indian Legion, presented as the unit's colours in late 1942 or early 1943, featured the same design as the arm badge previously issued to the men of the Legion. It consisted of saffron, white and green horizontal bands, from top to bottom, the white middle band was approximately three times the width of the coloured bands. The words \\"Azad\\" and \\"Hind\\" in white were inscribed over the saffron and green bands respectively, and over the white middle band was a leaping tiger. This is essentially the same design that the Azad Hind Government later adopted as their flag (although photographic evidence shows that the Indian National Army, at least during the Burma Campaign, used the Swaraj flag of the INC instead). =Decorations= In 1942, Bose instituted several medals and orders for service to Azad Hind. As was typical for German decorations, crossed swords were added when they were issued for action in combat. Nearly half of the soldiers of the legion received one of these decorations. =Structure and units= The Indian Legion was organised as a standard German army infantry regiment of three battalions of four companies each, at least initially with exclusively German commissioned officers. It has been later referred to as Panzergrenadier Regiment 950 (indische), indicating the unit was partially motorised. It was equipped with 81 motor vehicles and 700 horses. In this structure, the legion came to consist of: * I. Bataillon ‚Äì infantry companies 1 to 4 * II. Bataillon ‚Äì infantry companies 5 to 8 * III. Bataillon ‚Äì infantry companies 9 to 12 * 13. Infanteriegesch√ºtz Kompanie (infantry-gun company ‚Äì armed with six 7.5 cm leichtes Infanteriegesch√ºtz 18) * 14. Panzerj√§ger Kompanie (anti-tank company ‚Äì armed with six Panzerabwehrkanone) * 15. Pionier Kompanie (engineer company) * Ehrenwachkompanie (honour guard company) It also included hospital, training, and maintenance staff. Operations Field Marshal Erwin Rommel inspecting a unit of the Indian Legion at the Atlantic Wall in France, 10 February 1944. Shooting at sea targets from the Atlantic Wall in France, February 1944. It is doubtful that Subhas Chandra Bose envisaged the Free India Legion would ever be an army sufficient or strong enough to conduct an effective campaign across Persia into India on its own. Instead, the IR 950 was to become a pathfinder, preceding a larger Indo-German force in a Caucasian campaign into the western frontiers of British India, that would encourage public resentment of the Raj and incite the British Indian Army into revolt. Following German defeat in Europe at Stalingrad and in North Africa at El Alamein, it became clear that an Axis assault through Persia or even the Soviet Union was unlikely. Meanwhile, Bose had travelled to the Far East, where the Indian National Army was able to engage the Allies alongside the Japanese Army in Burma, and ultimately in northeastern India. The German Naval High Command at this time made the decision to transfer much of the leadership and a segment of the Free India Legion to South Asia and on 21 January, they were formally made a part of the Indian National Army. Most troops of the Indian Legion, however, remained in Europe through the war and were never utilised in their originally planned role. Adrian Weale has written that about 100 members of the Indian Legion were parachuted into eastern Persia in January 1942 tasked with infiltrating Baluchistan Province as Operation Bajadere. However, Adrian O'Sullivan has described such an operation as being \\"mythical\\", as it was logistically impossible, and no documentary evidence demonstrates it ever took place. =Netherlands and France= Troops of the Indian Legion at the Atlantic Wall near Bordeaux, France, March 1944. The legion was transferred to Zeeland in the Netherlands in April 1943 as part of the Atlantic Wall and later to France in September 1943, attached to the 344th Infantry Division and later the 159th Infantry Division of the Wehrmacht. From Beverloo in Belgium, the 1st Battalion was reassigned to Zandvoort in May 1943 where they stayed until relieved by the Georgian Legion in August. In September 1943, the battalion was deployed on the Atlantic coast of Bordeaux on the Bay of Biscay. The 2nd Battalion moved from Beverloo to the island of Texel in May 1943 and stayed there until relieved in September of that year. From here, it was deployed to Les Sables-d'Olonne in France. The 3rd Battalion remained at Oldebroek as Corps Reserve until the end of September 1943, where they gained a \\"wild and loathsome\\" reputation amongst the locals. =Transfer to the Waffen-SS= The legion was stationed in the Lacanau (near Bordeaux) at the time of the Normandy landings, and remained there for up to two months after D-Day. On 8 August 1944 Himmler authorised its control to be transferred to the Waffen-SS, as was that of every other foreign volunteer unit of the German Army. The unit was renamed the Indische Freiwilligen Legion der Waffen-SS. Command of the legion was very shortly transferred from Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Kurt Krapp to Oberf√ºhrer Heinz Bertling. The Indian personnel noticed a change of command was at hand and started to complain. Noting he wasn't \\"wanted\\", Bertling soon agreed to be relieved of command. On 15 August, the unit pulled out of Lacanau to make its way back to Germany. It was in the second leg of this journey, from Poitiers to Ch√¢teauroux that it suffered its first combat casualty (Lieutenant Ali Khan) while engaging French regular forces in the town of Dun. The unit also engaged with Allied armour at Nuits-Saint-Georges while retreating across the Loire to Dijon. It was regularly harassed by the French Resistance, suffering two more casualties (Lieutenant Kalu Ram and Captain Mela Ram). The unit moved from Remiremont through Alsace to Camp Heuberg in Germany in the winter of 1944, where it stayed until March 1945. =Italy= The 9th Company of the Legion (from the 2nd Battalion) also saw action in Italy. Having been deployed in the spring of 1944, it faced the British V Corps and the Polish II Corps before it was withdrawn from the front to be used in anti-partisan operations. It surrendered to the Allied forces in April 1945, still in Italy. =End of the Legion= With the defeat of the Third Reich imminent in May 1945, the remainder of the Indian Legion stationed in Germany sought sanctuary in neutral Switzerland. They undertook a desperate march along the shores of Lake Constance, attempting to enter Switzerland via the alpine passes. This was, however, unsuccessful and the legion was captured by US and French forces and delivered to British and Indian forces in Europe. There is some evidence that some of these Indian troops were shot by French Moroccan troops in the town of Immenstadt after their capture, before they could be delivered to the British forces. The captured troops would later be shipped back to India, where a number would stand trial for treason. Legacy The integral association of the Free India Legion with Nazi Germany and the other Axis powers means its legacy is seen from two viewpoints, similarly to other nationalist movements that were aligned with Germany during the war, such as the Russian Vlasov movement. One viewpoint sees it as a collaborationist unit of the Third Reich; the other views it as the realisation of a liberation army to fight against the British Raj. Unlike the Indian National Army, conceived with the same doctrine, it has found little exposure since the end of the war even in independent India. This is because it was far removed from India, unlike Burma, and because the Legion was so much smaller than the INA and was not engaged in its originally conceived role. Bose's plans for the Legion, and even the INA, were too grandiose for their military capability and their fate was too strongly tied to that of the Axis powers. Looking at the legacy of Azad Hind, however, historians consider both movements' military and political actions (of which the Legion was one of the earliest elements, and an integral part of Bose's plans) and the indirect effect they had on the era's events. In German histories of the Second World War, the Legion is noted less than other foreign volunteer units. Filmmaker and author Merle Kr√∂ger, however, made the 2003 mystery novel Cut! about soldiers from the Legion in France. She said she found them an excellent topic for a mystery because scarcely any Germans had heard of the Indians who volunteered for the German Army. The only Indian film to mention the Legion is the 2011 Bollywood production Dear Friend Hitler, which portrays the Legion's attempted escape to Switzerland and its aftermath. =Perceptions as collaborators= In considering the history of the Free India Legion, the most controversial aspect is its integral link to the Nazi Germany, with a widespread perception that they were collaborators with Nazi Germany by the virtue of their uniform, oath and field of operation. The views of the founder and leader of the Azad Hind movement, Subhas Chandra Bose, were somewhat more nuanced than straightforward support for the Axis. During the 1930s Bose had organised and led protest marches against Japanese imperialism, and wrote an article attacking Japanese imperialism, although expressing admiration for other aspects of the Japanese regime., cited in Bose's correspondence prior to 1939 also showed his deep disapproval of the racist practices and annulment of democratic institutions by the Nazis.Bose to Dr. Thierfelder of the Deutsche Akademie, Kurhaus Hochland, Badgastein, 25 March 1936. \\"Today I regret that I have to return to India with the conviction that the new nationalism of Germany is not only narrow and selfish but arrogant. The recent speech of Herr Hitler in Munich gives the essence of Nazi philosophy‚Ä¶The new racial philosophy which has a very weak scientific foundation stands for the glorification of the white races in general and the German race in particular. Herr Hitler has talked of the destiny of white races to rule over the rest of the world. But the historical fact is that up till now the Asiatics have dominated Europe more than have the Europeans dominated Asia. One only has to consider the repeated invasions of Europe by Mongols, the Turks, the Arabs (Moors), the Huns and other Asiatic races to understand the strength of my argument‚Ä¶\\", cited in He nonetheless expressed admiration for the authoritarian methods which he saw in Italy and Germany during the 1930s, and thought they could be used in building an independent India. Bose's view was not necessarily shared by the men of the Free India Legion, and they were not wholly party to Nazi ideology or in collaboration with the Nazi machinery. The Legion's volunteers were not merely motivated by the chance to escape imprisonment and earn money. Indeed, when the first POWs were brought to Annaburg and met with Subhas Chandra Bose, there was marked and open hostility towards him as a Nazi propaganda puppet. Once Bose's efforts and views had gained more sympathy, a persistent query among the POWs was 'How would the legionary stand in relation to the German soldier?'. The Indians were not prepared to simply fight for Germany's interests, after abandoning their oath to the King-Emperor. The Free India Centre‚Äîin charge of the legion after the departure of Bose‚Äîfaced a number of grievances from legionaries. The foremost were that Bose had abandoned them and left them entirely in German hands, and a perception that the Wehrmacht was now going to use them in the Western Front instead of sending them to fight for independence. The attitude of the Legion's soldiers was similar to that of the Italian Battaglione Azad Hindoustan, which had been of dubious loyalty to the Axis cause‚Äîit was disbanded after a mutiny. In one instance, immediately prior to the first deployment of the Legion in the Netherlands in April 1943, after the departure of the 1st Battalion from K√∂nigsbr√ºck, two companies within the 2nd Battalion refused to move until convinced by Indian leaders. Even in Asia, where the Indian National Army was much larger and fought the British directly, Bose faced similar obstacles at first. All of this goes to show that many of the men never possessed loyalty to the Nazi cause or ideology; the motivation of the Legion's men was to fight for India's independence. The unit did allegedly participate in atrocities, especially in the M√©doc region in July 1944, and in the region of Ruffec, including rapes and child murder and the department of Indre during their retreat, and in addition, some elements of the unit undertook anti-partisan operations in Italy. = Role in Indian independence = However, in political terms Bose may have been successful, owing to events that occurred within India after the war.Public Relations Office, London. War Office. 208/761A After the war, the soldiers and officers of the Free India Legion were brought as prisoners to India, where they were to be brought to trial in courts-martial along with Indians who were in the INA. Their stories were seen as so inflammatory that, fearing mass revolts and uprisings across the empire, the British government forbade the BBC from broadcasting about them after the war. Not much is known of any charges made against Free India Legion soldiers, but the Indian National Army trials that were initiated had the sentences they issued commuted or charges dropped, after widespread protest and several mutinies. As a condition of independence readily agreed to by the INC, members of the Free India Legion and INA were not allowed to serve in the post-independence Indian military, but they were all released before independence. Once the stories reached the public, there was a turnaround in perception of the Azad Hind movement from traitors and collaborators to patriots. Although the authorities expected to improve the morale of their troops by prosecuting the Azad Hind volunteers, they only contributed to the sentiment among many members of the military that they had been on the wrong side during the war. According to historian Michael Edwardes, the \\"INA and Free India Legion thus overshadowed the conference that was to lead to independence, held in the same Red Fort as the trials\\". Inspired to a large extent by the stories of the soldiers at trial, mutiny broke out in the Royal Indian Navy, and received widespread public support. While the troops who fought for the Allies were being demobilised, the Navy mutiny was followed up by smaller mutinies in the Royal Indian Air Force, and a mutiny in the Indian Army that was suppressed by force. In the aftermath of the mutinies, the weekly intelligence summary issued on 25 March 1946 admitted that the Indian military was no longer trustworthy, and for the Army, \\"only day to day estimates of steadiness could be made\\".Unpublished, Public Relations Office, London. War Office. 208/761A The armed forces could not be relied upon to suppress unrest as they had been before, and drawing from experiences of the Free India Legion and INA, their actions could not be predicted from their oath to the King-Emperor.Unpublished, Public Relations Office, London. War Office. 208/819A 25C Reflecting on the factors that guided the British decision to relinquish their rule in India, Clement Attlee, then the British Prime Minister, cited as the most important reason the realisation that the Indian armed forces might not prop up the Raj. Although the British government had promised to grant dominion status to India at the end of the war, the views held by British officials after the war show that although militarily a failure the Indians who fought for the Axis likely accelerated Indian independence.

His mission is still used today as a reference point in debates between China and Tibetan independence activists. Family background George Bogle was the third son of a wealthy Glasgow merchant, George Bogle of Daldowie, one of the Tobacco Lords and Anne Sinclair, a gentlewoman directly descended from James I and James II of Scotland. His father had extensive connections in the Scottish landed, commercial, and governmental elite, as well as trading contacts across the British Empire.Teltscher, Kate. (2006). The High Road to China: George Bogle, the Panchen Lama and the First British Expedition to Tibet, p. 26. Bloomsbury, London, 2006. The Scots gentry to whom he belonged were in turn, in the 18th century, a key feature in the British state. Their political allegiance was often managed through patronage. In particular, Henry Dundas was able to offer the younger sons of gentry opportunities in India. This was to be a significant feature in George's career. Education and early career Born in 1746 at the family seat of Daldowie, on the right bank of the Clyde River as the youngest of one of seven surviving children and the youngest of three brothers, his elder brother John Bogle eventually came to own a plantation in Virginia. His other brother, Robert, after the failure of a business adventure in London (the importing house of \\"Bogle and Scott\\"), established a cotton plantation in Grenada. Both these brothers were intimately involved in the Transatlantic slave trade. His four sisters married into their gentry network of traders, lairds and lawyers. His mother died when he was thirteen. The following year he matriculated at Edinburgh University where he studied logic. He completed his education, when he was 18, at a private academy in Enfield, near London. Following this, he spent six months travelling in France. His brother Robert then took him on as a clerk in his London offices of Bogle and Scott where he spent four years as a cashier.Teltscher, Kate. (2006). The High Road to China: George Bogle, the Panchen Lama and the First British Expedition to Tibet, p. 27. Bloomsbury, London, 2006. India Using his family network, he secured an appointment as a writer in the British East India Company (BEIC). In 1770, he landed in Calcutta, the centre of East India Company power in India. His extensive letters home, as well as his journal entries, show him to have been a lively, entertaining and perceptive writer. The comments of his colleagues and others show him to have been an agreeable, indeed playful ‚Äì if sometimes riotous ‚Äì companion. These qualities no doubt influenced Warren Hastings, the Governor- General of the BEIC, when he appointed him as his private secretary. His letters show that he was aware of being under suspicion of corruption, and had some misgivings about it ‚Äì Hastings would soon be impeached for corruption ‚Äì although Bogle was determined to make his fortune come what may. Envoy to Bhutan and Tibet The Sixth Panchen Lama Receives George Bogle at Tashilhunpo, oil painting by Tilly Kettle, c. 1775. In 1773, Hastings responded to an appeal for help from the Raja of the princely state of Cooch Behar to the north of Bengal, whose territory had been invaded by the Zhidar the Druk Desi of the Kingdom of Bhutan the previous year. Hastings agreed to help on the condition that Cooch Behar recognise British sovereignty. The Raja agreed and with the help of British troops they pushed the Bhutanese out of the Duars and into the foothills in 1773. Zhidar, the Druk Desi, returned to face civil war at home. His opponent Jigme Senge, the regent for the seven- year-old Shabdrung (the Bhutanese equivalent of the Dalai Lama), had lent his support to popular discontent. Zhidar was unpopular for his corvee tax (he sought to rebuild a major dzong in one year, an unreasonable goal), as well as for his overtures to the Manchu Emperors which threatened Bhutanese independence. Zhidar was soon overthrown and forced to flee to Tibet, where he was imprisoned and a new Druk Desi, Kunga Rinchen, installed in his place. Meanwhile, the Sixth Panchen Lama, who had imprisoned Zhidar, interceded on behalf of the Bhutanese with a letter to Hastings, imploring him to cease hostilities in return for friendship. Hastings saw the opportunity to establish relations with both the Tibetans and the Bhutanese and wrote a letter to the Panchen Lama proposing \\"a general treaty of amity and commerce between Tibet and Bengal.\\" Hastings then lost no time in appointing Bogle to undertake a diplomatic and fact-finding mission \\"to chart the unknown territory beyond the northern borders of Bengal\\", with a view to opening up trade with Tibet and possibly establishing a back-door trade relationship with the Qing Empire who tightly controlled foreign trade at Canton under the Canton System. Hastings instructions to Bogle, given on 18May 1774, were as follows: > \\"I desire you will proceed to Lhasa ... The design of your mission is to > open a mutual and equal communication of trade between the inhabitants of > Bhutan [Tibet] and Bengal ... You will take with you samples, for a trial of > such articles of commerce as may be sent from this country ... and you will > dilligently inform yourself of the manufactures, productions, goods > introduced by the intercourse with other countries which are to be procured > in Bhutan ... The following will be also proper objects of your inquiry: the > nature of the roads between the borders of Bengal and Lhasa and the > neighbouring countries, their government, revenue and manners ... The period > of your stay must be left to your discretion. Bogle's expedition set out the same year and consisted of himself, an army surgeon named Alexander Hamilton, and Purangir Gosain (an agent of the Sixth Panchen Lama, the effective ruler of Tibet), as well as a retinue of servants. Despite warnings from the Qing government and the Panchen Lama that he was not allowed to enter Tibet, he made use of the recent political instability in Bhutan and tension between the Panchen Lama and the regent for the 7th Dalai Lama to win access to Tibet where he was brought before the Panchen Lama in Shigatse. Bogle made a favourable impression on the Sixth Panchen Lama and spent six months overwintering in his palaces learning what he could of Tibetan culture and politics. Bogle was struck by the experience, noting in his journal, 'When I look upon the time I have spent among the Hills it appears like a fairy dream.' It may have been the publication of accounts of his journey which established the myth of Tibet as Shangri-la. Bogle helped the Panchen Lama compose his still famous Geography of India. Returning to India, Bogle fulfilled the Panchen Lama's request to establish a temple on the banks of the Ganges, not far from the East India Company headquarters, where Buddhist monks could return to their spiritual roots in India. Although the ultimate goal of establishing a trade route to China was not met, a long- lasting relationship was formed between the British and the Tibetans. The mission to Tibet was viewed as a success, and was commemorated by a 1775 portrait of Bogle being presented (in Tibetan gowns) to the Panchen Lama. This portrait, by Tilly Kettle, a British painter who worked in Calcutta, was reputedly presented by Hastings to King George III and it is now in the Royal Collection. Overtures to China The hopes for a breakthrough in China rested on using the Lama as an intermediary with the Qianlong Emperor of the Manchu-led Qing Empire, an astute but aloof ruler who regarded all the world as tributaries. In 1780, Palden Yeshe visited Beijing where he came close to gaining a passport for Bogle. The Qianlong Emperor presented him with a golden urn for use in ceremonial lotteries and the goodwill seemed to suggest that a passport would be issued. However, he was struck down by smallpox and died that same year. (It was not until 1793 that a British envoy, Lord Macartney was, very sceptically, received by the Qianlong Emperor). Death Bogle died, probably of cholera, on 3 April 1781,Stewart, op. cit. p. 145 and was buried in South Park Street Cemetery, Calcutta.Bernstein, Jeremy Dawning of the Raj The Life and Trials of Warren Hastings Chapter One, Prologue, George Bogle, Ivan R Dee, Lanham MD USA, 2000 He had never married, but left behind a son George, and two daughters, Martha and Mary. According to family lore, the girls' mother was Tibetan. The two girls were sent back to Daldowie House, where they were brought up by Bogle's family and eventually married Scotsmen.Teltscher, Kate.

This edition provided a partial impetus for the Tibetan journeys of Sarat Chandra Das. Das translated and published parts of the Tibetan biography of the Third Panchen Lama, including descriptions of his friendship with Bogle. Some critics have ascribed Bogle and Das as major inspirations for Rudyard Kipling's novel Kim, shown by Kipling's use of the title \\"Teshoo Lama\\" (an alternate title of the Panchen Lama used by Bogle and other British sources of the time).Teltscher, op. cit., pp 257‚Äì260 The Bogle mission has echoes today. The Chinese government has used it on official websites to suggest that Britain recognised Chinese sovereignty over Tibet.Teltscher, op. cit., pp 265 They portray the meeting of the Panchen Lama as one where he kowtowed in submission to the Qianlong Emperor. The Tibetans suggest it was a meeting between a pupil (the emperor) and a revered master (the Lama). According to the Asia Times, in 1995 the search for the 11th Panchen Lama culminated with Beijing and the Dalai Lama proclaiming rival child candidates, Gyaincain Norbu and Gedhun Choekyi Nyima respectively, with Chinese officials using the Qianlong Emperor's urn as a symbol of legitimacy and sovereignty.

It can be used for finding the positions of the Moon, Sun, and planets without calculation, using a geometrical model to represent the position of a given celestial body.  Overview  The earliest extant record of a solar equatorium, that is, one to find the position of the sun, is found in Proclus's fifth-century work Hypostasis, where he gives instructions on how to construct one in wood or bronze. Although planetary equatoria were also probably made by the ancient Greeks, the first surviving description of one is from the Libros del saber de astronomia (Books of the knowledge of astronomy), a Castilian compilation of astronomical works collected under the patronage of Alfonso X of Castile in the thirteenth century, which includes translations of two eleventh century Arabic texts on equatoria by Ibn al‚ÄêSam·∏• and al-ZarqƒÅlƒ´. Theorica Planetarum (c. 1261-1264) by Campanus of Novara describes the construction of an equatorium, the earliest known description in Latin Europe. Richard of Wallingford (1292‚Äì1336) is known to have built a sophisticated equatorium named Albion in 1326. It could calculate lunar, solar and planetary longitudes. Unlike most equatoria, the Albion could also predict eclipses. The device is described in a manuscript and in drawings by the Abbot. It consisted of several rotating disks, showing the courses of the sun, moon and stars. These disks were operated manually. It was not a clockwork mechanism.  History  Al-Zarqali, was an Arab Muslim instrument maker, mathematician, and astronomer. He wrote a treatise on the construction of his improved equatorium in around 1080/1081 CE. He was the first to show clearly that the motion of the solar apogee - when the sun is furthest from earth - is 12.0 seconds per year (the actual value is 11.8 seconds per year). Al-Zarqali also corrected Ptolemy's work, calculating the length of the Mediterranean Sea as 42¬∞, while Ptolemy said it was 62¬∞. His work was quoted multiple times in Nicolaus Copernicus's ‚ÄúDe Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium‚Äù where he discussed the revolution of the celestial orbs. Although Al-Zaqali's work was based on the belief that the earth was at the center of the universe, many of his primary concepts still apply to the modern world of astronomy. Al-Zarqali designed his equatorium using the Ptolomaic astronomical model, which held that the earth was at the center of the universe with the stars fixed to a large sphere surrounding it. Ptolemy theorized that all of the stars moved around the earth every single day, and the motion of the sun, moon, and planets surrounded it. He believed that each planet moved on a small sphere or circle, called an epicycle, that moved on a larger sphere or circle, called a ‚Äúdeferent‚Äù which contains the earth at the center. The equatorium was designed on the principles of epicycle and deferent.  Variations  The history of the equatorium does not just end after the 11th Century but it inspired a more diverse invention called ‚ÄúThe Albion‚Äù. The Albion is an astronomical instrument invented by Richard of Wallingford at the beginning of the 14th Century. It has various functional uses such as that of the equatorium for planetary and conjunction computations. It can calculate when eclipses will occur. The Albion is made up of 18 different scales which makes it extremely complex in comparison to the equatorium. The history of this instrument is still disputed to this day, as the only Albion from the past is both unnamed and unmarked.  Astrolabe compared with equatorium  To understand where the roots of the Equatorium began, look back to what inspired it: the Astrolabe. The history of the Astrolabe dates back to roughly 220 BC and was invented by Hipparchus. The difference between the two instruments is that the Astrolabe measures the time and position of the sun and stars at a specific location in time. There are also specialized astrolabes for land and for boats. The Astrolabe works by adjusting the moveable components (labels) to a specific date and time. Afterward, line up the astrolabe with the horizon by holding it up and setting one end of the label to where one end is at eye level and the opposite end is pointed towards whichever celestial structure you want to view. In contrast, the equatorium is a rarer astronomical instrument. It is used to calculate the past or future positions of the planets and celestial bodies according to the planetary theory of Ptolemy. What is similar about these tools is that they are both calculating devices that simplify and efficiently make geometrical calculations.  Uses  The equatorium can further be specialized depending on the epicycle. There are three possible epicycles that can be adjusted to serve for planetary positions in three groups: the moon, the stars, and the sun. The sun was considered a planet in the Ptolemaic system, hence why the equatorium could be used to determine its position. Through the use of Ptolemy's model, astronomers were able to make a single instrument with various capabilities that catered to the belief that the solar system had the earth at the center. In fact, specialized equatoriums had astrological aspects of medicine, as the orientation of planets gave insight to zodiac signs which helped some doctors cater medical treatments to patients. At least 15 minutes was needed to calculate the planetary position with the use of a table for each celestial body. A horoscope of that era would have required the positions of seven astronomical objects, requiring nearly two hours of manual calculation time.

Early life Robert Napier was born in Dumbarton at the height of the Industrial Revolution, to James and Jean Napier. James was of a line of esteemed bell- wrights, blacksmiths, and engineers, with a brother (also named Robert) who served as blacksmith for the Duke of Argyll at Inveraray Castle. Napier was educated at the burgh school where he took an interest in drawing, which reflected in his later life in an interest in painting and fine arts. Against his father's hopes that he would become a minister in the Church of Scotland, he developed an interest in the family business. At age sixteen, he was confronted by a Royal Navy press gang who intended to conscript him into service during the Napoleonic Wars. Instead of allowing his son to be conscripted, James Napier signed a contract of formal indenture with his son, making him immune to conscription. Napier's apprenticeship with his father lasted for five years, after which time he moved to Edinburgh and worked for Robert Stevenson, builder of the Bell Rock Lighthouse. =Robert Napier and Sons= Napier set up his own business in 1815, and in August 1815 was admitted to the Incorporation of the Hammermen of Glasgow, following the example of his father and grandfather.James Napier: Life of Robert Napier of West Shandon. Publisher: William Blackwood and sons, Edinburgh and London 1904 In 1841 he took his sons James and John into partnership and their firm's name became Robert Napier and Sons. Marine engines and shipbuilding Early side- lever engine designed by Napier, from PS Leven (1823), on display at the Scottish Maritime Museum in Dumbarton In 1823 he won a contract to build a steam engine for the paddle steamer Leven. The engine was so good that it was later fitted to another ship, the paddle steamer Queen of Beauty. The Leven engine ‚Äì his first engine ‚Äì now rests at the Denny Ship Model Experiment Tank branch of the Scottish Maritime Museum in Dumbarton. In 1827, Napier had the unique distinction of having built the engines of both of the two fastest ships to compete in the Northern Yacht Club's August Regatta, namely the paddle steamers Clarence and Helensburgh. This earned him a reputation as a shipbuilder, which furthered his career, as did his co-operation on hull design with Thomas Assheton Smith, for whom he built the Menai (400 tons and 120hp) followed by several more steam yachts.C.Dawson, \\"Thomas Assheton Smith's Steam Yachts\\", The Mariner's Mirror, Vol.92, Issue 3, August 2006 In 1828 he established Glasgow's Vulcan Foundry. Many of Scotland's most esteemed shipbuilders apprenticed under Napier, including James and George Thomson, who founded the J & G Thomson shipyard (now known as John Brown & Company), and John Elder of the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company. Napier continued building steamship engines, eventually expanding into steam engines for ocean-going vessels. In 1835 he procured a controversial contract with the East India Company to build an engine for their ship, the paddle steamer Berenice which, built by David Napier, (Napier's cousin) and using Napier's engine, proved faster than her sister ship, the paddle steamer Atalanta (built on the Thames) ‚Äì beating her to India by 18 days on their maiden voyage. In 1838, Napier was contracted by the Admiralty to produce 280 NHP engines for two of their ships, the first class paddle steamer sloops Stromboli and Vesuvius; but after that, orders ceased. When Napier had this queried in Parliament, the reply proved that Napier's engines were cheaper and more reliable than those built in the Admiralty's usual shipyards on the Thames. Thereafter, Napier was the Admiralty's primary engine builder. Napier's greatest success, however, came from his business deals with Samuel Cunard. Together with Cunard, James Donaldson, Sir George Burns, and David MacIver, he co-founded the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. It seems that Napier could be considered responsible for the livery of the Cunard funnels, since the vermilion colour and black hoops were already used on earlier Napier-engined ships, as evidenced by the shipbuilder's model of P.S. \\"Menai\\" of 1830 in the Scottish Transport Museum in Glasgow. In 1841 he expanded his company to include an iron shipbuilding yard in Govan and the Parkhead Forge Steelworks, and in 1843 they produced their first ship, the Vanguard. He also procured a contract with the Royal Navy to produce vessels, notably the Jackal, the Lizard, and the Bloodhound, which became the first iron vessels in the Royal Navy. He allowed naval officers in training to visit the shipyard to familiarise themselves with the new vessels. The Parkhead Forge was acquired by William Beardmore and Company in 1886. Napier's shipyard in Govan was also later acquired by Beardmore's in 1900 before being sold on to Harland & Wolff in 1912, and finally closed in 1962. The Parkhead Forge would eventually close in 1976.

Morva had been in jail awaiting trial on an attempted robbery charge, but was taken to MRH after sustaining a sprained ankle and wrist while in jail. After using the restroom, he attacked the security guard and a Montgomery County Sheriff's deputy. Morva escaped the emergency department, but was captured the next day. While escaping capture, he shot and killed Montgomery County sheriff's Cpl. Eric Sutphin on the morning of August 21. =Virginia Tech shooting= The hospital received several patients that were wounded in the Virginia Tech shooting on April 16, 2007.

It displays the expected rate of return of an individual security as a function of systematic, non-diversifiable risk. The risk of an individual risky security reflects the volatility of the return from security rather than the return of the market portfolio. The risk in these individual risky securities reflects the systematic risk.Security Market Line - SML Formula The Y-intercept of the SML is equal to the risk-free interest rate. The slope of the SML is equal to the market risk premium and reflects the risk return tradeoff at a given time: :\\\\mathrm{SML} : E(R_i) = R_f + \\\\beta_{i}[E(R_M) - R_f]\\\\, where: : is an expected return on security : is an expected return on market portfolio :Œ≤ is a nondiversifiable or systematic risk : is a market rate of return : is a risk-free rate When used in portfolio management, the SML represents the investment's opportunity cost (investing in a combination of the market portfolio and the risk-free asset). All the correctly priced securities are plotted on the SML. The assets above the line are undervalued because for a given amount of risk (beta), they yield a higher return. The assets below the line are overvalued because for a given amount of risk, they yield a lower return.Investopedia explains Security Market Line - SML In a market in perfect equilibrium, all securities would fall on the SML. There is a question about what the SML looks like when beta is negative. A rational investor will accept these assets even though they yield sub-risk-free returns, because they will provide \\"recession insurance\\" as part of a well-diversified portfolio. Therefore, the SML continues in a straight line whether beta is positive or negative. A different way of thinking about this is that the absolute value of beta represents the amount of risk associated with the asset, while the sign explains when the risk occurs.Tom Geurts and Andrey Pavlov, \\"Calculating the Cost of Capital for REITs: A Classroom Explanation.\\" Real Estate Review 34 (Fall 2006). Security Market Line, Treynor ratio and Alpha All of the portfolios on the SML have the same Treynor ratio as does the market portfolio, i.e. :\\\\frac{E(R_i) - R_f}{\\\\beta_i} =E(R_M) - R_f. In fact, the slope of the SML is the Treynor ratio of the market portfolio since \\\\beta_M=1. A stock picking rule of thumb for assets with positive beta is to buy if the Treynor ratio will be above the SML and sell if it will be below (see figure above). Indeed, from the efficient market hypothesis, it follows that we cannot beat the market. Therefore, all assets should have a Treynor ratio less than or equal to that of the market. In consequence, if there is an asset whose Treynor ratio will be bigger than the market's then this asset gives more return for unity of systematic risk (i.e. beta), which contradicts the efficient market hypothesis. This abnormal extra return above the market's return at a given level of risk is what is called the alpha.

Its initial and most notable project, the Antirom CD-ROM, was funded by Arts Council of Great Britain and focussed on exploring interactivity in its own right, rather than being an interface to existing content such as video, audio and text. The group's process included producing many small interactive 'toys' that revolved around a single idea such as sound mixing, bouncing or scrolling elements. In the context of multimedia, at the time, this was a very different approach to the dominant \\"encyclopaedia\\" format such as Encarta. Antirom influenced several other designers such as Brendan Dawes who said of the group, \\"these guys changed things. Nothing was the same in the world of so called multimedia ever again. I remember seeing the amazing, different work for Levi's, which had a massive impact on me.\\" At this stage in the development of the multimedia industry, most titles were lavishly produced and funded by large organisations hoping to create a breakthrough product that generated a lot of sales. The Antirom CD took what were at the time innovative interaction techniques such as using the mouse to control bizarre sounds and animations of random lines and colours and created experiences that confounded, entertained and confused. In his essay Cinema As A Cultural Interface (also a chapter in The Language of New Media), new media theorist, Lev Manovich, uses Antirom's work in HotWired's now defunct RGB Gallery to describe \\"how cultural interfaces stretch the definition of a page while mixing together its different historical forms\\". Co-founders were Andy Cameron, Andy Allenson, Rob LeQuesne, Luke Pendrell, Sophie Pendrell, Andy Polaine, Nicolas Roope, Tom Roope, and Joe Stephenson. Anthony Rogers, Joel Baumann and Jason Tame joined the group later. Many of the members were students under Cameron's lectureship at the School of Media, Arts and Design at the University of Westminster. Tom Smith also introduced the team to new multimedia programming techniques in his role as visiting lecturer there. Aside from continued experimental work and research, the collective produced commercial work for clients such as The Science Museum, the BBC and Levi Strauss & Co.. Antirom had a flat non-hierarchical structure with all collective members having an equal say in how the collective was run. The group finally disbanded in 1999 and its members continue to work in other studios and academia.

Below is a list of teams who have been referred to by the media as golden generations, most of which played in the 21st century. Origins It was first coined by the Portuguese sports media to refer to a group of exceptionally gifted teenage Portuguese footballers. This group of players, spearheaded by \\"Golden Boy\\" Lu√≠s Figo, won two Football World Youth Championships in 1989 and 1991. This group were close to retirement in the early part of the 21st century, leading the European sports media to spotlight the Golden Generation's chances of winning a senior trophy at tournaments such as UEFA Euro 2000, the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Euro 2004 (which Portugal hosted) and the 2006 World Cup. Since then, it has been used by media in many different countries, with usage spreading to other areas, for example, in rugby. Basketball =Argentina (2000‚Äì2012)= Led by Manu Gin√≥bili and accompanied by players like Luis Scola, Fabricio Oberto, Carlos Delfino, Andres Nocioni, Pablo Prigioni and Walter Herrmann, the Argentina national basketball team between 2000 and 2012 is often titled the \\"Golden Generation\\". The team received huge international success, winning the gold medal in the Americas Championship 2001, silver medal in 2002 FIBA World Championship, the gold medal in Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics, gold medal in FIBA Diamond Ball 2008, bronze medal in Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and gold medal in 2011 FIBA Americas Championship played in the city of Mar del Plata, Argentina. Resulting in Argentina reaching the first position in the FIBA Men's Ranking at the end of the 2008 Olympic Games. The team was the first to defeat a United States national team with a full squad of NBA players. They did so by 87‚Äì80 in the 2002 FIBA World Championship held in Indianapolis. They again defeated the U.S. Team in the semifinals of the Olympic Basketball tournament in 2004, before beating Italy in the final of the same tournament. This makes them the only team being able to interrupt the dominance of the U.S. in the professional era of Basketball at the Olympics. Football = Asia =  Australia (2005‚Äì2011)  This Australian team waited 32 years to qualify for a FIFA World Cup tournament. This group of players formed the backbone of Australia's 2006 FIFA World Cup, 2007 AFC Asian Cup, 2010 FIFA World Cup, and 2011 AFC Asian Cup squads and was used extensively during Australia's qualification matches for those respective tournaments. The group are considered to be among the best Australia have ever produced and featured players such as Harry Kewell, Mark Viduka, Tim Cahill, Mark Schwarzer, Mark Bresciano, Lucas Neill, Craig Moore, Tony Popovic, Scott Chipperfield, Vince Grella, Stan Lazaridis and John Aloisi.  Vietnam (2017‚Äì)  The Vietnam national under-23 football team under head coach Park Hang-seo became the first Southeast Asian team, to qualify for the finals of an AFC tournament, when they finished as runners up of the 2018 AFC U-23 Championship. The olympic squad later joined the 2018 Asian Games and got through to the quarterfinals for the first time in their history, only losing to South Korea in the semifinals and the United Arab Emirates in the Bronze medal match on penalties. Most players from the U-23 and Olympic squad were promoted to the senior National team after their great performances, meanwhile coach Park Hang-seo was promoted to head coach of the Vietnam national football team. Vietnam's Golden Generation later continually gained historical achievements, becoming one of the top 8 national teams of the 2019 Asian Cup when they made it to the quarterfinals, before losing to eventual runners up of the tournament, Japan. Vietnam also currently rank first in their World Cup 2022 Qualification group. Numerous players in the Golden Generation have played internationally, with several from the 2014 U19 National Team experiencing matches with young English and Italian teams, while those who come from the 2017 U20 National Team were the first young Southeast Asian Team ever to compete in the World Cup. The Golden Era started in 2017, the year that Vietnam marked a milestone when its U20 team reached the FIFA U20 World Cup for the first time in the history of Vietnamese football. It has since progressed into a fantastic 2018 and 2019 where Vietnam performed extremely well in regional tournaments, such as the AFF Championship, and Southeast Asian Games to prove they are the king of Southeast Asia. As well as continental tournaments, such as the AFC U-23 Championship, Asian Games, Asian Cup, and the AFC FIFA World Cup qualifying to show they are an emerging, fast developing football nation, that might be slowly creeping in with the top of Asia, and could be a future new World Cup representative. Vietnam is considered to be one of the ‚Äúdark horses‚Äù at the AFC Asian level. Here are 11 representative players of the Golden Generational : Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Ph∆∞·ª£ng, Nguy·ªÖn Tu·∫•n Anh, Nguy·ªÖn Quang H·∫£i, Nguy·ªÖn Ti·∫øn Linh, ƒê·ªó H√πng D≈©ng, Qu·∫ø Ng·ªçc H·∫£i, Tr·∫ßn ƒê√¨nh Tr·ªçng, B√πi Ti·∫øn D≈©ng (Defender), ƒê·∫∑ng VƒÉn L√¢m, ƒêo√†n VƒÉn H·∫≠u, Nguy·ªÖn Tr·ªçng Ho√†ng. Other considerable players include: V≈© VƒÉn Thanh, Ph·∫°m ƒê·ª©c Huy, Nguy·ªÖn Huy H√πng, L∆∞∆°ng Xu√¢n Tr∆∞·ªùng (Vietnam 2018 U23 national team captain), ƒê·ªó Duy M·∫°nh, H√† ƒê·ª©c Chinh, Phan VƒÉn ƒê·ª©c, Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng ƒê·ª©c, Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Th·∫Øng, Nguy·ªÖn Th√†nh Chung, H·ªì T·∫•n T√†i, T√¥ VƒÉn V≈©, Nghi√™m Xu√¢n T√∫, H·ªì Kh·∫Øc Ng·ªçc, M·∫°c H·ªìng Qu√¢n, V√µ Huy To√†n, etc = Europe =  Belgium (2013‚Äì)  Golden Generation\\" won the bronze medal at the 2018 FIFA World Cup; after beating England 2-0. The current Belgium squad is considered by the media, press and fans as the best Belgium squad ever; featuring key players such as Eden Hazard, Dries Mertens, Kevin De Bruyne, Romelu Lukaku, Axel Witsel, Thibaut Courtois, Thorgan Hazard, Toby Alderweireld, Vincent Kompany, and Jan Vertonghen. At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, from the beginning of the tournament, Belgium were considered by many as one of the favourites to win the tournament. Belgium finished top of the group on maximum points, beating Panama, Tunisia and England. Belgium earned a famous 2‚Äì1 win over five-time champions Brazil in the quarter-finals. Belgium lost 1‚Äì0 to France in the semi-finals, but beat England in the third place play-off, Belgium's best ever result at the World Cup and best result at a major tournament since 1980.  Bosnia and Herzegovina (2010‚Äì2017)  The current Bosnia and Herzegovina national team was seen by many as the most talented generation the nation has ever had. They qualified for 2014 FIFA World Cup, their first ever World Cup since their independence and got their first ever World Cup victory, against Iran on 25 June 2014.  Croatia (2017‚Äì)  Croatia players pose with Vladimir Putin and Kolinda Grabar-Kitaroviƒá after the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final. The current Croatia team have been considered by several British media such as The Guardian as the \\"Second Coming of the Golden Generation\\"; in reference to the Golden Generation of Croatia from the late 1990s who won the bronze medal in at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Croatia's debut at the World Cup. The team, under the leadership of captain Luka Modriƒá and the style of play by key players such as Mario Mand≈æukiƒá, Ivan Rakitiƒá and Ivan Peri≈°iƒá, reached the 2018 FIFA World Cup final, losing to France 2‚Äì4, thus earning the silver medal. From the final onwards, however, their results continued to decline following the retirement of Mand≈æukiƒá, Danijel Suba≈°iƒá and Vedran ƒÜorluka. They debuted at the UEFA Nations League with a 6‚Äì0 loss to Spain in Elche, and were ultimately relegated from the competition's first tier by England. The squad were praised for their performance at the World Cup.  Czech Republic (1996‚Äì2006)  The Golden generation of the Czech Republic were born in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Highlights of their generation include finishing second in UEFA Euro 1996 and third in UEFA Euro 2004. The national team was also qualified for the first time to a Fifa World Cup in 2006. During the first few years of the twenty first century the team were often ranked in the top five of the FIFA World Ranking. Czech Republic was the second best team in the world in 2005. Many of the squad during this time played in the best leagues in Europe for the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus F.C. One of them, Pavel Nedvƒõd, even won the Ballon d'Or in 2003. For the first time in the history of this small Central European country, a Czech player won the Champions League. It happened in 2005 during Miracle of Istanbul. Milan Baro≈° and Vladim√≠r ≈†micer winning with Liverpool FC.  England (2001‚Äì2010)  During the reign of Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson, Adam Crozier, the chief executive of the Football Association and some members of the British media, touted players such as David Beckham, Michael Owen and Steven Gerrard as the nucleus of a potential Golden Generation team. Despite some impressive performances such as the 2001 Germany vs England football match in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers and the individual players' successes at club level, inconsistency resulted in this group of players failing to live up to expectations, resulting in the group becoming synonymous with disappointment and failed potential. After Eriksson left in 2006 and Steve McClaren became manager, although many of the players continued to achieve success with their respective clubs, the team failed to qualify for UEFA Euro 2008, only the second time England failed to qualify for a major tournament in over 20 years (of the last 12 major tournaments). Rio Ferdinand claimed that the pressure of the \\"Golden Generation\\" tag had a negative effect on the players, restricting their ability to perform to their full potential for the national team. In 2017, Pep Guardiola said he could not understand why England did not achieve more with players such as Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole, Paul Scholes, Steven Gerrard, John Terry and Rio Ferdinand and claimed they were on the same level as Spain's golden generation of 2008‚Äì2014.  France (1998‚Äì2006)  In late 1998 the France national football team began a period of international dominance defeating Brazil 3‚Äì0 to win the 1998 FIFA World Cup, becoming the first French team to win the World Cup. Two years later, David Trezeguet's golden goal in extra time gave France a 2‚Äì1 win over Italy to give France the 2000 European Championship. France was subsequently ranked No. 1 in the FIFA World Rankings and ranked No. 1 in the World Football Elo Ratings for two years. The team also secured the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup. Despite this impressive recent record, the French team flopped at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, losing to newcomers Senegal in the opening match of the tournament and crashing out in the group stages without scoring a goal and taking only one point from their three games. A year later they were successful at the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. They also reached the World Cup final in Berlin at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, where they lost to Italy. The French golden team was composed of players such as Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet, Lilian Thuram, Patrick Vieira, Didier Deschamps, Fabien Barthez, Emmanuel Petit, Marcel Desailly, and Bixente Lizarazu.  Hungary (1950‚Äì1956)  Between 1950 and 1956, the team recorded 42 victories, 7 draws and just one defeat, in the 1954 World Cup final against West Germany. Under the Elo rating system they achieved the highest rating recorded by a national side (2230 points, 30 June 1954).  Portugal (2000‚Äì2006)  Portugal won consecutive FIFA Youth Championships in 1989 and 1991. Subsequently, Portugal's senior team reached the semi-finals of Euro 2000 and were runners-up at Euro 2004 on home soil. They were also 2006 FIFA World Cup semi-finalists. Some critics have written that this generation underachieved at international level. It included players such as Rui Costa; Joao Pinto; Paulo Sousa; Costinha; Ricardo Carvalho; Luis Figo and Fernando Couto.  Spain (2008‚Äì2014)  This generation of players (most notably including Xavi, Andr√©s Iniesta, Sergio Ramos, Xabi Alonso, Fernando Torres, David Villa, Gerard Piqu√©, Sergio Busquets, Carles Puyol, Carlos Marchena, Iker Casillas, Victor Valdes, Pepe Reina, Cesc F√†bregas, David Silva, Jesus Navas, Juan Mata and Pedro) helped Spain win the UEFA European Championship in 2008 and 2012, and the FIFA World Cup in 2010, making them the first team ever to win the World Cup and both continental championships either side of it. They also reached the final of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. During this time, Spain dominated the FIFA World Rankings, topping the rankings almost uninterrupted for six years, between July 2008 and July 2014.  Yugoslavia (1987‚Äì1992)  Yugoslavia's generation of young footballers won the 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship and finished runner-up at the 1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. The nation then reached the quarter-finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup and, a year later, a Red Star Belgrade team featuring many of the national team's stars became the first Yugoslav side to ever win the European Cup. Yugoslavia qualified for UEFA Euro 1992 with seven wins from eight matches and the best goalscoring record and goal difference of any team during the qualifying phase. However, the team was disqualified prior to the tournament due to the Yugoslav Wars (it was replaced by the eventual champion, Denmark) and did not play together again after the country's division. Several players from the Yugoslav team went on to finish in third place at the 1998 World Cup with Croatia. =Africa=  Algeria (2014‚Äì)  The Algerian team which reached the second round of the 2014 FIFA World Cup has been described as a golden generation, or a \\"second golden generation\\" in reference to the Algerian team this algerian generation also won the 2019 african cup of nations which reached the 1982 and 1986 World Cups and which won the 1990 African Nations Cup.  Ivory Coast (2006‚Äì2015)  Despite winning the 1992 edition of the Africa Cup of Nations, the country saw an outpour of talent during the first half of the 2000s (decade). The majority of this generation consisted of talented players who enjoyed and still enjoy considerable success in Europe. Led by Didier Drogba (who is also the national team's highest ever goalscorer), several other players found contracts in the biggest football stages in the world, such as brothers Yaya and Kolo Tour√©, Didier Zokora, Emmanuel Ebou√©, Gervinho and Salomon Kalou. During this period, Ivory Coast managed its first FIFA World Cup appearances in 2006, 2010 and 2014. They also won the Africa Cup of Nations in 2015. = Central America =  Costa Rica (2014‚Äì)  The \\"Ticos\\" surprised the whole world with their performance at the 2014 FIFA World Cup when they topped their group that included former world champions Italy Uruguay and England. In the round of 16 they beat Greece 5‚Äì3 on penalties after a 1‚Äì1 draw, seeing them through to the quarterfinals for the first time ever. At the quarterfinals, the Costa Ricans fought the Netherlands to a 0‚Äì0 draw after extra time; the game then went to penalties in which Costa Rica lost 4‚Äì3 to the Netherlands. This \\"Golden Generations\\" include a selection of players that have played and succeeded in Europe such as: Keylor Navas, Bryan Ruiz, Celso Borges, Bryan Oviedo, Joel Campbell, √ìscar Duarte, Giancarlo Gonz√°lez and others. = South America = =Argentina (2000‚Äì2012)= By winning the gold medal in the Americas Championship 2001, silver medal in 2002 FIBA World Championship, the gold medal in Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics, gold medal in FIBA Diamond Ball 2008, bronze medal in Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and gold medal in 2011 FIBA Americas Championship played in the city of Mar del Plata, Argentina. Resulting in Argentina reached the first position in the FIBA Men's Ranking at the end of the 2008 Olympic Games.  Chile (2007‚Äì2017)  The Chile team won back to back Copa Am√©rica titles in 2015 and in 2016. The backbone of this team came from the U-20 squad that went on to finish third in the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup (most notably Alexis S√°nchez and Arturo Vidal). However, in 2017 they finished runners-up to Germany's B-team at the Confederations Cup and then inexplicably failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, despite most of the squad being in the primes of their careers, following unexpected losses to Bolivia and Paraguay in qualification. http://remezcla.com/sports/chile-golden-generation-world-cup/  Colombia (2012‚Äì)  The current Colombia team are considered as the \\"Second Golden Generation\\" of Colombia, in reference to Colombia's Golden Generation from the 1980s and 1990s. Under key players James Rodr√≠guez, Juan Cuadrado and Radamel Falcao, the team reached the 2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage after topping a group featuring Greece, Ivory Coast and Japan, winning all three games. Colombia then beat Uruguay in the round of sixteen, before suffering a 1‚Äì2 defeat to host nation Brazil, in the quarter-finals. James Rodr√≠guez was the tournament top goalscorer; and Colombia earned the FIFA Fair Play Award. At the Copa Am√©rica Centenario, Colombia won third place after beating the United States 1‚Äì0. At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Colombia were considered group favourites for Group H; featuring Japan, Poland and Senegal. Following a 1‚Äì2 defeat to Japan in which they went down to 10-men in under five minutes, Colombia beat Poland 3‚Äì0 and later beat Senegal 1‚Äì0 to qualify as group winners. They were knocked out by England in the round of sixteen; losing on penalties. Between June and August 2016, Colombia were ranked as 3rd in both FIFA and Elo ranking. Ice hockey =Canada (2005‚Äì2016)= Born in the mid-1980s, the Canadian national men's hockey team has had a golden generation which contributed to five consecutive IIHF World U20 Championships between 2005 and 2009, and subsequently won back-to-back gold medals at the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics, and gold at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. Twelve players have also won the Stanley Cup and six are members of the Triple Gold Club. =Finland (2014‚Äì)= Born in the mid to late 1990s, the Finnish national men's hockey team has had a golden generation of young stars. Finland won the IIHF World U20 Championships in 2014, 2016 and 2019. In the 2016 NHL Draft, three of the top five picks were Finnish. =Sweden (1991‚Äì2006)= Born in the early 1970s, the Swedish national ice hockey team had a golden generation of players that achieved great success in the NHL and eventually won gold at the 2006 Winter Olympics, beating Finland with 3‚Äì2 in the gold medal game.

The tunnel connects FDR Drive, which runs along the east side of Manhattan Island, with the West Side Highway (New York State Route 9A, or NY 9A), which runs along the island's west side. Opened in 1951, it was the second section of the FDR Drive to be completed. The underpass crosses beneath the Battery (formerly Battery Park) and the approach to the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel. History Eastern portal at the FDR Drive in front of the Battery Maritime Building The underpass started construction in 1949 and opened to the public on April 10, 1951. The underpass runs underneath the Battery, connecting the West Side Highway to the South Street Viaduct with two lanes of traffic in each direction. The project was completed shortly after the opening of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel in 1950, and provides direct access between the tunnel and the FDR Drive. In 2005, during the reconstruction of NY 9A, the western end of the Battery Park Underpass was extended to the north by about to provide a U-turn lane and amenities for pedestrians and bicyclists. During Hurricane Sandy, the tunnel was filled completely with seawater and required major repairs. =Plans for extension= There have been three proposals to extend the tunnel north on the FDR Drive side. *In 1971, it was suggested that the South Street Viaduct be turned into a tunnel, essentially extending the underpass north to the Brooklyn Bridge *In 2002, the Downtown Alliance, the local business improvement district, called for a 350-foot (105 m) extension to the underpass to create a plaza in front of the Battery Maritime Building. The estimated cost was $70 million. *In 2005, Mayor Michael Bloomberg also called for an extension of the underpass near the Battery Maritime Building as part of a plan to rehabilitate the South Street Viaduct.

In the comic book universe, Batman's personal Batcycle is a modified street-bike with a 786 cc liquid-cooled V-4 engine. It contains a computer-controlled carburetor and bulletproof wind-guard. In other media =Live-action television= Batman (TV series) Batman (1966) The Batcycle made its first appearance in 1966 in the Batman TV series. It was a 1965 Harley Davidson with a side car, but it was taken on lease and was only used for the first season episode \\"Not Yet, He Ain't\\". Later that year, a new Batcycle was introduced. It was produced by Kustomotive, conceived by Dan Dempski, designed by Tom Daniel, and built by Dan and Korky Korkes using a Yamaha Catalina 250. It was leased to 20th Century Fox starting on April 18, 1966 for $50 a week with an additional $350 up front. The new Batcycle was first used in the 1966 film Batman and continued to appear in the rest of the TV series. Hubie Kerns and Victor Paul did most of the stunt work with the motorcycle throughout the series. The total amount paid to Kustomotive was $2,500. When the series was canceled, Kustomotive used the Batcycle in car shows, paying royalties to Greenway, 20th Century Fox, and National Periodical Publications. Kustomotive built four replicas of the Batcycle for tours. Robin's sidecar (a detachable self- propelled vehicle) was authenticated by Burt Ward on the television series Hollywood Treasure and sold at auction for $30,000. Batwoman The Batcycle appears in the series Batwoman as Batwoman's personal vehicle. =Live-action films= Batman & Robin The Batblade from the film Batman & Robin. The Batblade is the name of a specialized motorcycle used by Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) in the 1997 film Batman & Robin. This vehicle can function under the most extreme weather conditions. The Batblade was built on the body of a drag racer: the rear tire comes not from a motorcycle, but from a car. The Dark Knight Trilogy The Batpod from The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises The Batcycle is known as the Batpod for The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012).The Dark Knight Special Features: \\"Gotham Uncovered: Creation of the Scene\\" featurette The bike has 20\\" front and rear tires and is powered by a high-performance, water-cooled, single- cylinder engine - geared toward the lower end for faster acceleration and with no exhaust pipes: the exhaust is routed through the hollow steel/aluminum/magnesium tubing used for the frame of the bike. The Batpod is steered by the shoulders instead of hands, and the rider's arms are protected by shields. The two foot pegs are set 3¬Ω feet apart on either side of the tank, which the rider lies on, belly down. The engine noise was designed around the Shepard tone, for which sound effects came, in part, from the sound of the Tesla Roadster's electric motor. The Batpod ejects out of the Tumbler's front end, with the Tumbler's front wheels becoming the Batpod's front and rear wheels. Because the Tumbler is ordered to self-destruct, the Batpod allows Batman to continue his pursuit. For the film, the bike is armed with grappling hooks, cannons, and machine guns. Six models were constructed for the film's production to anticipate some of them crashing. One action sequence in the film shows the wheels rolling against their normal axes, seemingly for added stability in sharp turns or other maneuvers. This also allows for instant changes in direction - if the driver approaches a wall, the Batpod's central frame will rotate to keep the driver upright (the inspiration for this useful chassis feature may well have been the innovative wheel configuration on a Killough Platform into omnidirectionally mobile chasses). The Batpod's chassis also elongates, allowing the rider to pass under low-hanging obstacles, as when Batman slaloms underneath a tractor trailer the Joker is driving. The term \\"Batpod\\" is mentioned by Alfred Pennyworth only once in the movie. The Batpod is used again in The Dark Knight Rises (2012). At first, it serves as Batman's primary vehicle. Later, Selina Kyle uses the Batpod during the final battle against Bane's forces for the fate of Gotham. Batman uses the Bat to fight Bane's stolen Tumblers from the air while Selina uses the Batpod to open a tunnel to allow Gotham civilians to escape, to shoot Bane, and to destroy at least two of Bane's Tumblers while tracking the nuclear bomb Bane and Talia al Ghul intended to use to destroy the city. During filming on August 9, 2011, a stunt performer collided with an IMAX camera while filming a chase scene involving Kyle's Batpod. =Animated television= DC Animated Universe The Batcycle was one of the many vehicles used by Batman and Robin in Batman: The Animated Series. The Batcycle was themed to look like Batman's other vehicles, the Batmobile, Batwing, and Batboat. Batman would use it in certain episodes, as would Robin. Perhaps the most important part the Batcycle played in the series was in the movie Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, where Batman jumped off the Batcycle so it would crash into a giant fan that was being controlled by the Joker. The Batcycle saw a little more use from Robin, particularly in the episode \\"Robin's Reckoning.\\" Robin would continue to use a variation of the Batcycle in later seasons after he had become Nightwing. Batman always donned a helmet, modeled to accommodate his cowl's ears, before driving the Batcycle. The Batman The Batcycle makes only a few appearances in The Batman. The first is in the episode, \\"The Cat and the Bat,\\" in which Catwoman steals Batman's utility belt and inadvertently sends the Batmobile careening out of control on autopilot. Batman uses the Batcycle to catch-up with and retrieve the other vehicle. The Batcycle's second appearance on the program is in the episode, \\"RPM\\". The Batmobile is wrecked during a pursuit of Gearhead, and Batman must use the Batcycle to continue the battle against the villain when the rebuilt Batmobile is not fully operational in time. The Batcycle ends up destroyed after Gearhead infects its computerized system with a nanotech virus during this same episode. Robin uses a variation of the Batcycle featuring his own colors in The Batman. Robin also has a similarly styled bike in the Teen Titans animated series. =Video games= *'Batman & Robin' (Robin drives the Redbird, and Batgirl drives the Batblade) *Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu (the Batcycle and the Nightwing Cycle are unlockable 3D Models in the Trophy Room) *Lego Batman: The Video Game *Lego Batman 2: DC Superheroes *The Dark Knight (canceled) =Toys= Art Asylum created a toy version of the Batcycle for C3 Sets Wave 2 of Minimates in 2005. LEGO paired the Batcycle with \\"Harley Quinn's Hammer Truck\\" for their LEGO Batman line. In 2008, Mattell's Hot Wheels line released a 1/50 scale of the 1966 Batcycle, and in 2009, released a 1/12 scale of the same model. Both featured detachable sidecars. An upgraded 'Elite' version of the 1/12 model is also expected, with even greater detail. The Batblade has also been mentioned as a candidate for the 2010 series of 1/50 Bat-vehicles.

The eastern terminus of the route is at the New York-Pennsylvania border in Shohola Township, where PA 434 crosses the Delaware River and enters New York, becoming New York State Route 55 (NY 55) at an intersection with NY 97 in the town of Highland. PA 434 used to be part of PA 37 and PA 137.  Route description  Sign for PA 434 northbound in Greeley PA 434 begins at an intersection with PA 739 and State Route 4004 (SR 4004) in Lords Valley, a community in Blooming Grove Township. PA 434 heads to the northeast, passing businesses and homes before leaving the community. The highway then gets into a more scenic rural region, with trees surrounding the highway. PA 434, which makes several curves for the next few miles, passes to the south of a lake. The highway continues on for several miles in this way. A short time later, the highway passes a couple homes and crosses Shohola Creek. Just north of the creek, the area becomes somewhat urbanized with homes beginning to surround the road again. However, this does not last long, with forests returning once more. Just north of the community, PA 434 intersects U.S. Route 6 (US 6). PA 434 northbound in Shohola After the intersection with US 6, the surroundings around the highway become a mix of homes and forests. This lasts for much of the distance on PA 434 until Greeley, where it becomes urbanized again. In downtown Greeley, PA 434 splits at an intersection where PA 590 begins. The highway makes a curve, turning to the southeast for a distance north of Greeley. Soon afterwards,PA 434 parallels Shohola Creek, heading northeastward. PA 434 begins to become urbanized for a third time, passing some large buildings along with homes and forests. The creek continues to parallel, with the highway turning in several different directions. The forests begin to recede as PA 434 enters Shohola Township. Twin Lakes Road, a quadrant route, terminates at PA 434 before crossing the Delaware River and becoming NY 55 and Sullivan County Route 11 at the border. History In 1928, what is now PA 590 between Lackawaxen and present-day PA 434 in Greeley was designated PA 37. From Greeley, PA 37 continued south along the PA 434 alignment to its southern terminus at US 6]. In 1946, PA 37 was removed from the PA 590 alignment. While PA 37 occupied the segment of modern PA 434 from US 6 to Greeley, a spur of PA 37, PA 137, occupied the remainder of PA 434 from Greeley to the state line from 1928 to 1946. In 1946, however, PA 37 was realigned to follow the entire alignment of PA 434 from US 6 to New York, decommissioning PA 137 in the process. PA 37 remained in existence until 1967 when PA 37 was replaced by PA 434. In 2004, PA 434 was extended from its southern terminus down to an intersection with PA 739 in Lords Valley. PA 434 shared a brief concurrency US 6 after its extension to PA 739 was created. A new unsignalized intersection was built between 2005 and 2008 eliminating this concurrency.

It broadcasts 24 hours a day with a varied program of national and international music hits of the moment, news reports and live sport events. The station was set up in 1958 by Che Guevara in the Sierra Maestra region of eastern Cuba, and was designed to broadcast the aims of the 26th of July Movement led by Fidel Castro. Transmitting on shortwave, Radio Rebelde also broadcast the latest combat news, music and spoken literature to the people of Cuba during the Cuban Revolution. Today, Radio Rebelde has forty-four transmitters on the FM dial covering 98 percent of the island of Cuba, plus a shortwave signal on the 60-meter band at 5.025 MHz, (5025 kHz) and several AM transmitters on various frequencies, most commonly 530, 540, 550, 560, 600, 610, 620, 670, 710, and 770 kHz.Radio Rebelde, radio station of Cuba - History History The radio broadcasts were initiated in February 1958 by the rebel army's media wing, under Guevara's supervision. Guevara had reportedly been impressed by the power of radio after experiencing first hand the role of a CIA clandestine radio station, La Voz de la Liberaci√≥n, in ousting the government of Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala. Revolution! Clandestine Radio and the Rise of Fidel Castro By Don Moore An electric generator and the first radio equipment had arrived in Pata de la Mesa, Guevara's command post, where the rebels were to set up the clandestine station and begin broadcasting. Early broadcast efforts were conducted by Luis Orlando Rodr√≠guez, who later became Minister for the Interior. The first broadcast began with the announcement: \\"Aqu√≠ Radio Rebelde, the voice of the Sierra Maestra, transmitting for all Cuba on the 20-meter band at 5 and 9 pm daily... I'm station director Capt. Luis Orlando Rodr√≠guez.\\" Later, Carlos Franqui arrived from Miami, United States, to become the movement's overall director of information. Soon, as the fighting intensified, Franqui and the transmitter relocated to Fidel Castro's command post in La Plata, Cuba. The broadcasts became a vital source of communication due to increased government restrictions on the Cuban press. A new boosted transmitter in La Plata carried lengthy interviews and speeches by Fidel Castro and provided radiotelephone communication between the rebel columns throughout the region. Expansions in rebel numbers and more ambitious military ventures away from the group's base in the Sierra Maestra meant that each fighting column needed its own radio equipment. Eventually 32 Rebelde stations were operating throughout Cuba. The stations broadcast nightly, with each broadcast beginning with the loud declaration \\"¬°Aqu√≠ Radio Rebelde!\\" (\\"Here Radio Rebelde!\\") that has remained the station's trademark salutation to the present day, followed by the Cuban national anthem and the 26th of July hymn. On April 9, 1958, the station broadcast calls for the nation's workers to join in a general strike. Rebelde also broadcast the first reports that Guevara's column had taken Santa Clara on New Year's Eve 1958, and on the first morning of the new year Castro broadcast a call for another general strike. During the transmission he rejected any attempts by the Cuban military to replace Fulgencio Batista by a coup d'√©tat and urged his revolutionary force to press on to the cities of Havana and Santiago. His final words were \\"¬°Revoluci√≥n S√≠, Golpe Militar No!\\" (Revolution Yes, Military coup No!). Within hours the army had surrendered in full. In turn, Venezuelan broadcasts had the initiative to retransmit the war parts of Radio Rebelde through Radio Rumbos and Radio Continent, which allowed to know the advances of the Castro guerillas and the setbacks of the dictator Batista.

Investopedia There are a number of different techniques, calculations and time-frames that may be used to determine the general direction of the market to generate a trade signal (forex signals), including the current market price calculation, moving averages and channel breakouts. Traders who employ this strategy do not aim to forecast or predict specific price levels; they simply jump on the trend and ride it. Due to the different techniques and time frames employed by trend followers to identify trends, trend followers as a group are not always strongly correlated to one another. Trend following is used by commodity trading advisors (CTAs) as the predominant strategy of technical traders. Research done by Galen Burghardt has shown that between 2000-2009 there was a very high correlation (.97) between trend following CTAs and the broader CTA index.  Definition  Trend following is an investment or trading strategy which tries to take advantage of long, medium or short-term moves that seem to play out in various markets. Traders who employ a trend following strategy do not aim to forecast or predict specific price levels; they simply jump on the trend (when they perceived that a trend has established with their own peculiar reasons or rules) and ride it. These traders normally enter in the market after the trend \\"properly\\" establishes itself, betting that the trend will persist for a long time, and for this reason they forego the initial turning point profit. A market \\"trend\\" is a tendency of a financial market price to move in a particular direction over time. If there is a turn contrary to the trend, they exit and wait until the turn establishes itself as a trend in the opposite direction. In case their rules signal an exit, the traders exit but re-enter when the trend re-establishes. Cutting Loss. Exit market when market turn against them to minimize losses, and \\"let the profits run\\", when the market trend goes as expected until the market exhausted and reverses to book profit. This trading or \\"betting with positive edge\\" method involves a risk management component that uses three elements: number of shares or futures held, the current market price, and current market volatility. An initial risk rule determines position size at time of entry. Exactly how much to buy or sell is based on the size of the trading account and the volatility of the issue. Changes in price may lead to a gradual reduction or an increase of the initial trade. On the other hand, adverse price movements may lead to an exit from the entire trade. In the words of Tom Basso, in the book Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom The key reasons for trending markets are a number of behavioral biases that cause market participants to over-react: Herding: After markets have trended, some traders jump on the bandwagon, and thus prolonging the herding effect and trends. Confirmation Bias: People tend to look for information that confirm their views and beliefs. This can lead investors to buy assets that have recently made money, and sell assets that have declined, causing trends to continue. Risk Management: Some risk- management models will sell in down markets as, for example, some risk budgets have been breached, and buy in up markets as new risk budgets have been unlocked, causing trends to persist. \\"Don't fight the tape\\" is a term that means do not bet or trade against the trend in the financial markets, i.e., if the broad market is moving up, do not bet on a downward move. The term \\"tape\\" refers to the ticker tape used to transmit the price of stocks.Barron's finance & investment handbook by John Downes, Jordan Elliot Goodman 2003 page 353Wall Street words by David Logan Scott 2003 page 113 It is analogous to the trader's maxim, \\"The trend is your friend.\\"  Considerations  *Price: One of the first rules of trend following is that price is the main concern. Traders may use other indicators showing where price may go next or what it should be but as a general rule these should be disregarded. A trader need only be worried about what the market is doing, not what the market might do. The current price and only the price tells you what the market is doing. *Money management: Another decisive factor of trend following is not the timing of the trade or the indicator, but rather the decision of how much to trade over the course of the trend. *Risk control: Cut losses is the rule. This means that during periods of higher market volatility, the trading size is reduced. During losing periods, positions are reduced and trade size is cut back. The main objective is to preserve capital until more positive price trends reappear. *Rules: Trend following should be systematic. Price and time are pivotal at all times. This technique is not based on an analysis of fundamental supply and demand factors. *Diversification: Research published by hedge fund manager Andreas Clenow shows that cross asset diversification is an essential part of professional trend following. Example A trader would identify a security to trade (currencies/commodities/financials) and would come up with a preliminary strategy, such as:Covel, Michael W. (2009). Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets. FT Press; 1 Updated edition (February 25, 2009). . *Commodity: soybean oil *Trading approach: long and short alternately. *Entrance: When the 50 period simple moving average (SMA) crosses over the 100 period SMA, go long when the market opens. The crossover suggests that the trend has recently turned up. *Exit: Exit long and go short the next day when 100 period SMA crosses over 50 period SMA. The crossover suggests that the trend has turned down. *Stop loss: Set a stop loss based on maximum loss acceptable. For example, if the recent, say 10-day, average true range is 0.5% of current market price, stop loss could be set at 4x0.5% = 2%. Conventional wisdom on stop losses set the risk per trade anywhere between 1%-5% of capital for a single trade; this risk varies from one trader to another. The trader would then backtest the strategy, using actual data and would evaluate the strategy. The simulator would generate estimated number of trades, the fraction of winning/losing trades, average profit/loss, average holding time, maximum drawdown, and the overall profit/loss. The trader can then experiment and refine the strategy. Care must be taken, however, to avoid over-optimization. It is possible that a majority of the trades may be unprofitable, but by \\"cutting the losses\\" and \\"letting profits run\\", the overall strategy may be profitable. Trend trading is most effective for a market that is quiet (relative low volatility) and trending. For this reason, trend traders often focus on commodities, which show a stronger tendency to trend than on stocks, which are more likely to be mean reverting (which favors swing traders). In addition to quiet low volatility markets, where trend following strategies perform well, trend trading is also very effective in high volatility markets (market crash). Trend traders \\"short\\" the market and benefit from the downside market trend.

The southern terminus is at PA 26 near the Hopewell Township community of Yellow Creek. The northern terminus is at PA 27 and PA 227 in Pleasantville. One of the longest and oldest highways in the commonwealth, PA 36 serves as a major connector between South Central and Northwestern Pennsylvania. In 1955, the highway was designated as the Colonel Drake Highway in honor of Edwin Drake. Route description =Bedford and Blair counties= PA 867 in Taylor Township, just outside Roaring Spring. PA 36 begins in the Bedford County hamlet of Yellow Creek at PA 26 along the Tussey Mountain range. The distance in Bedford County is brief as the highway enters Blair County and proceeds northward as the Woodbury Pike, intersecting several 800-series state highways like PA 866, PA 868, and PA 869. A short distance between Roaring Spring and the hamlet of McKee, PA 36 overlaps the east-west running PA 164. North of McKee, PA 36 becomes Catfish Ridge Road, closely paralleling the Frankstown Branch Juniata River to the west, and the Interstate 99‚ÄìU.S. Route 220 overlap to the east along the Brush Mountain range. Just south of Hollidaysburg, PA 36 has the only interchange with a non- freeway highway, Smith Road. North of Smith Road, PA 36 enters the borough as Logan Boulevard and intersects U.S. Route 22 in downtown at Blair Street. North of Hollidaysburg, PA 36 as Logan Boulevard becomes a major 4-lane divided arterial, serving the southern suburbs of Altoona. North of the I-99/US 220 underpass, PA 36 enters the city of Altoona. The route briefly overlaps U.S. Route 220 Business along West Plank Road. North of the overlap, PA 36 traverses the downtown areas of the city via Union Avenue and 18th street. Running on a west direction, 18th Street leads PA 36 out of Altoona, into the Appalachian Mountains and rural areas. =Cambria, Clearfield, and Jefferson counties= Near the Cambria County line, PA 36 has the first of five wrong-way concurrencies with PA 53 for a block in the hamlet of Ashville. West of the hamlet, PA 36 proceeds on a northwest direction into Clearfield County. Between the county line and the village of Mahaffey, PA 36 mostly runs parallel on the eastern banks of the Chest Creek. From Mahaffey to McGees Mills, PA 36 is overlapped with U.S. Route 219 along the northern banks of the West Branch Susquehanna River. The highway runs through Indiana County, passing through its far northeastern portion, for less than one mile (1.6 km). Briefly after entering Jefferson County, PA 36 takes a predominantly western course. PA traverses the borough of Punxsutawney as Main and Mahoning Streets while intersecting the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway (U.S. Route 119) and PA 436, a spur of 36. Outside the borough, PA 36 intersects another spur, PA 536, before taking a more northern alignment. In Brookville, PA 36 has a three- route concurrency with U.S. Route 322 and PA 28 along Main Street. North of the overlap, PA 36 becomes Allegheny Boulevard while interchanging Interstate 80 at exit 78. North of Brookville, PA 36 runs mostly on a northern course. In the northwestern sections of the county, the road intersects PA 949 in Sigel and PA 899 near Clear Creek State Park. PA 36 exits the county running west along the southern tips of the Clarion River in Cook Forest State Park. =Clarion, Forest, and Venango counties= PA 36 in Tionesta PA 36 enters Clarion County running westward. In the town of Leeper, the route intersects PA 66. Past Leeper, the highway runs northwest, intersecting PA 208, and exiting the county. In Forest County, PA 36 has a short overlap with U.S. Route 62, in the borough of Tionesta along the Allegheny River. In Venango County, PA 36 runs mostly northwest before reaching the northern terminus at PA 27 and PA 227 in Pleasantville. History PA 36 was originally designated from Pleasant Valley Boulevard (U.S. Route 220) in Altoona to PA 66 in Clarion County. From the original northern terminus to Tionesta, the highway was signed as PA 66, and from Tionesta to the current terminus, it was signed as PA 227. From Roaring Spring to the current southern terminus, it was designated as PA 426. By 1940, the northern terminus was moved to its current location. Also by this time, the southern terminus was extended south to U.S. Route 30 west of Everett along what is today Lower Snake Spring Road and Church View Road. By 1950, the current southernmost segment of PA 36 between PA 26 and Loysburg was redesignated as PA 868. On December 21, 1955, the route was designated as the \\"Col. Drake Highway\\" in honor of Edwin L. Drake, the first to drill for oil in the United States. By 1980, the southern terminus was moved to its current location.

It is the only remaining feature of what was known as the Old Baile. The origins of Baile Hill date back to 1068. Having seized York in that year, William the Conqueror built a castle on the south side of the city close to the River Ouse. Then, as a response to a rebellion the following year, a second castle was built on the opposite side of the river. There is no clear evidence which of these castles was built first, but it is generally thought to be the one which stood on the site of the later York Castle on the east side of the river, followed by the Old Baile on the west side. Like its opposite counterpart, the Old Baile was of motte and bailey design. The motte was approximately 40 feet (12 m) high and 180 feet (66 m) in diameter, and was surrounded by a large ditch. A flight of steps led to a wooden structure at the top which was surrounded by a fence, also made of wood. The bailey lay to the north-west of the motte and was rectangular. Around its perimeter was an earth rampart and an outer ditch. The castle, it is believed, was not in regular use for long. By the 13th century it was in the hands of the Archbishop of York and in 1322 Archbishop Melton agreed to defend it in times of war. By c.1340 part of the city wall had been built along the south-east and south-west sides of the Old Baile, incorporating the existing ramparts and ditch, however, these defences were rarely called into use. The only notable occasion was the siege of York in 1644 during the Civil War, when Baile Hill was used as a royalist gun emplacement. Apart from that, however, the Old Baile was used mainly for grazing and recreation activities, particularly archery during the medieval period. Today, Baile Hill stands at the junction of Baile Hill Terrace and Cromwell Road. The only other visible evidence of the former castle are two slight dips in the city wall rampart, one next to Baile Hill and the other close to Victoria Bar, which indicate the location of the former ditch. Houses built during the 1880s cover the rest of the Old Baile.

The band's debut album includes two Sferra-sung tracks, \\"Changes\\" and \\"Black Horse.\\" \\"Changes\\" became a staple of the band's live shows. After the band parted on amicable terms in the early 1970s, longtime friends Sferra and Keaggy recorded together again in 1993 for what would become Keaggy's solo album Crimson and Blue. The sessions also yielded material that surfaced on the album Blue, a collection virtually identical to Crimson and Blue, Sferra toured with Keaggy in support of Crimson and Blue and is featured on a live version of the song \\"Shouts of Joy\\" on Phil's anthology album Time 2: 1970-1995. In 1994, Phil's record label released Blue, an album featuring most of the songs from Crimson and Blue, with a slightly different track listing. In addition to a cover version of Badfinger's \\"Baby Blue,\\" the album featured an extended instrumental jam between Sferra and Keaggy titled \\"The Continuing Adventures of ...\\" Sferra and Keaggy later collaborated on the song \\"Chalice\\"‚Äîa poignant song about suffering that appeared on Phil's solo album Inseparable in 2000. Sferra did not perform on the studio recording as Keaggy recorded all the percussion parts on the album using drum machines. In 1995 John released Northbound. The album featured longtime friend and former Glass Harp bandmate Phil Keaggy on guitar and backing vocals. One song, \\"Let the Bells Ring,\\" was originally written in 1971 for Glass Harp's second album Synergy. Although Sferra re-recorded the song for Northbound, the original version was later included as a bonus track on the CD reissue of Synergy in 2005. Northbound is for sale only through Sferra's website. \\"Let the Bells Ring\\" and the title track are available there as free mp3 downloads. and at Itunes.com. On October 22, 2000, Sferra, Keaggy and bassist Daniel Pecchio reunited as Glass Harp for a concert in their hometown of Youngstown, Ohio at a sold out Powers Auditorium. Joining the band for the occasion was conductor Isaiah Jackson and members of the Youngstown Symphony. The following year saw the commercial release of the reunion concert in the form of the live album Strings Attached. The double album featured several Sferra compositions such as \\"Changes\\" and \\"Let the Bells Ring\\" as well as an extended drum solo. The Keaggy-Sferra song \\"Chalice\\" was also included, with the live version far surpassing the original studio recording in its instrumental passion.

An early formation of the company, wearing the livery of William Somerset, 3rd Earl of Worcester, is among the companies known to have toured the country in the mid-sixteenth century. A later iteration of the company toured through the 1580s and '90s; little is known about its activities, though in 1583 it included the sixteen-year-old Edward Alleyn, at the start of his illustrious career.Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 224. By the start of the seventeenth century, Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester was moving up into the higher levels of the late-Elizabethan social and political structure; in April 1601 he became the Queen's Master of the Horse.Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 225. It was to add to his prestige that Worcester wanted to bring his players to London. Through the 1590s, only two companies of adult players, the Lord Chamberlain's Men and the Admiral's Men, had been officially allowed in London. Worcester was able to make his company the third, with a license of the Privy Council as of 31 March 1602. The company was initially supposed to play only at the Boar's Head Inn; but by August of that year they were negotiating with Philip Henslowe. Soon they were playing at his Rose Theatre, which the Admiral's Men had vacated when they moved to the Fortune in 1600. (Henslowe did business with the members of Worcester's Men as he had with the Admiral's: many company members were soon in debt to him for small loans.) During their first year with Henslowe,The period for which the best data exists; the entries in Henslowe's Diary grow sporadic after 1603. Worcester's Men purchased a dozen plays from Henslowe's stable of regular house dramatists: Thomas Dekker, Wentworth Smith, John Day, Henry Chettle, Richard Hathwaye, and even a young John Webster. Most have not survived. The fee for a play was normally ¬£6, sometimes a pound or two higher; Dekker got an extra 10 shillings for one of his solo works.Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 227. In this incarnation, Worcester's Men included, at one time or another, John Lowin, actor/playwright Thomas Heywood and the famous clown Will Kempe. Christopher Beeston joined Worcester's Men in August 1602, after leaving the Lord Chamberlain's Men; another player from that company, John Duke, made the same move sometime in 1602. And in the latter part of that year Worcester's absorbed Oxford's Men, another company that had previously been active mostly as a touring troupe. In February 1603 they played A Woman Killed with Kindness, often called Heywood's best play. The troupe did not achieve a degree of success equal to that of the Lord Chamberlain's Men at the Globe or the Admiral's Men at the new Fortune; yet early in the reign of James I, the company received royal patronage and became Queen Anne's Men.

He is a bipedal deer who hunts humans in a fashion similar to typical deer hunting in order to avenge all deer hunted by humans. Bambo mounts the heads of humans he kills on a wall in his cabin. He can tote a vast array of weapons ranging from slingshots to machine guns. He is voiced by Brian McCann, who frequently appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. In the first three games, Bambo has a sleek physique with a bandana tied around his forehead, a forest green hunting vest, and an ammo bandolier. However, in the fourth game, Bambo has a broad-shouldered, muscular physique. The cause for this change was never explained. Bambo is very crude and crass, often farting, and yelling obscenities and stereotypical jokes at his prey. He also is very sexually inclined, and is often portrayed having sex with a doe. Starting with Deer Avenger 3D, polygon characters are used. In the fourth edition of the game, as Bubba, now an angel, floats to Heaven, he states will be back in Deer Avenger 5.

The main entrance is near the western end of the north wall. There are two similar doors in the south wall, one directly opposite the main entrance, the other (a priest's door) located towards the eastern end. The north wall is pierced by four windows, dated to circa 1330‚Äì1360, each containing a single light with tracery of trefoil design. The four windows on the southern side are of similar date and design, although each formerly contained two lights divided by a central mullion. Of these windows in the southern wall, the one nearest the altar (East) is flanked by a piscina and a sedilia. Facing the sedilia on the North side is a niche which is thought to be the location of the Easter Sepulchre. A plain aumbry sits in the East wall. In 1548 the chapel was suppressed during the dissolution of chantries in the reign of Edward VI and sometime after 1554 the chapel was used as a barnProceedings of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society Page(s)375-383 by the proprietors of the 16th century Red Lion Inn next door.

For over forty years, she simultaneously served as orchestral conductor, dramatic director, and vocal director for the Chaminade Opera Group, which she founded in 1959.Records of the Chaminade Opera Group She promoted the growth of opera, and the advancement of many performers ranging from amateur enthusiasts to internationally known professionals.

His obituary also says he played in the Burlington Symphony Orchestra He took Louise to countless rehearsals during her childhood. The two also performed in local theaters. She was a high school valedictorian and mastered the cello, like her father.Boston Globe Obituary She was lucky to come from a school with a very strong music program. Opera star Robert Rounseville and BSO violinist Sheldon Rotenberg and composer Ray Coniff were taught by her music teacher, who was a graduate of the New England Conservatory.page 237, \\"1894 Attleborough - Attleboro 1978\\", by Dr. Paul Tedesco, Copyright 1979 Attleboro Historical Commission, (1979) Attleboro, Mass. Rounseville came back to honor and commemorate this teacher years later, in 1953, after making the internationally renowned film version of the \\"Tales of Hoffman\\".May 16, 1953 Attleboro Sun-Times, Front Page. Rotenberg was on tour at the time, according to the article, and unable to attend. Even in high school, Louise Pettitt was promoting opera. She and her close friend, violinist Sheldon Rotenberg, tried to create an opera club at their school.\\"The Blue Owl\\", 1935. Louise and Sheldon were co-editors of the classical music section of a student publication at their high school. This enthusiasm for opera never left her. As a young woman she shifted from cello to classical singing, and sought the best training available in Boston, New York City, and Providence, Rhode Island. She trained with Gladys Childs Miller in Boston, Massachusetts, at the New England Conservatory from 1939 to 1941.Records of the New England Conservatory, Boston Globe Obituary Several of Miller's students went on to sing for the Vienna, Paris, and New York Metropolitan opera companies. One of them, Lillian Johnson, also came to sing for Louise in the Chaminade Opera Group. Louise also received instruction from Margaret Armstrong Gow of the Harvard Musical Association, Gertrude Erhardt, and others. She gradually became a leading soprano in the Boston area. She sang professionally for many of Greater Boston's better known churches. One of her most prominent recurring performances was the regular weekly recital at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. She later also sang at Tanglewood in the summers. And eventually, she became a member of the National Association of Teachers of Singing. Although she devoted more hours over her long life to the production of opera than to her own singing career, and though she was eventually better known as a teacher and director, she always considered herself to be a singer, and continued to give solo vocal performances into the 1970s. During her many years of opera work, she devoted time in every week to her voice students, and she continued to sing, generally in support of Chaminade. She also gradually gained some stage and drama experience in small local theatrical productions, and Gilbert and Sullivan; but in Massachusetts in the thirties and forties, there were few opportunities for young performers to try their hand at serious, fully staged opera. The only fully staged operas in Boston then were generally done by New York's Met on tour at the Huntington Avenue site. Opera \\"scenes\\" were done at NEC by Goldovsky and others in Jordan Hall. There were very few opera companies in existence then, compared to the 1970s. When Louise was finishing her studies at New England Conservatory in 1941, \\"..opera was then in eclipse...\\".page 99 \\"Measure by Measure: a History of N.E.C. from 1867\\" by Bruce McPherson and James Klein, copyright 1995 by the NEC Trustees.

One of her earliest acting credits was a minor local production called Aunt Emma Sees It Through ( performed January 24, 1936 ). When the faculty of Wheaton College ( Norton, Massachusetts ) formed its own Gilbert and Sullivan troupe in 1945, she became a perennial female lead for about 15 years, and never left the group.Seen the Norton Singers website. Her later ability to conduct opera was most likely complemented and improved by her concurrent responsibility as conductor/director for that group, beginning in 1961.Having been director of COG for two years, Louise also became director of Wheaton's Norton Singers in 1961. She played soprano roles in other Gilbert and Sullivan productions in eastern Massachusetts in the 1940s and 1950s. She and her husband performed a consistent repertoire of G & S scenes professionally for various civic women's clubs (Foxboro, Framingham, Boston, etc ) under contract to \\"Flora Frame\\" of Boston in the 1950s and early 1960s. She gave regular solo performances of arias in Boston and elsewhere. She performed in many area churches and other venues as a classical soloist in oratorios, light opera, and mixed programs. She sang at Old South Church, Trinity, St Paul's and many others. This experience, along with her classical musicianship and vocal training prepared her for her eventual role as opera conductor. When interest in opera grew in the late 1950s, her experience enabled her to make a vital, pioneering contribution. Boston Opera at a low point: 1933‚Äì1958 In the depths of the great depression, the Chicago opera company stopped touring in Boston. This cancellation and the creation of new companies in the late 1950s form the bookends of a difficult period for opera in Boston. The New England Conservatory had always been the backbone of local Boston opera companies in the twentieth century. But in the 1930s, the conservatory had great difficulty even maintaining a teaching schedule in opera.\\"Measure by Measure\\" Wallace Goodrich tried in 1936 to create a school of opera there without success.page 99, \\"Measure by Measure\\" When Louise was in attendance at NEC ( 1939‚Äì1941 Archives of the New England Conservatory of Music ), Goodrich was still trying to put together a program. Goodrich won approval to hire a conductor from London's famous Covent Garden in 1940, but this was a far cry from the robust opera department that he conceived. When Goldovsky was hired there in 1942 he was only paid $2,500 for the entire year and told to work part time.page 102 \\"Measure by Measure\\" Fortunately for him, he was able to supplement his income as of 1946 by becoming \\"Mr. Opera,\\" the voice that was broadcast every Saturday afternoon nationwide from New York by Texaco. By hiring Goldovsky in 1942, upon the recommendation of Koussevitsky, Goodrich laid the foundations for the renaissance that bore fruit over the next 50 years. But the 1940s and 1950s were still lean years compared to the 1960s and onward. The gas rationing of 1943 reduced Tanglewood to a simple red cross benefit concert in the Lennox public library, but this wasn't the entire reason for the leanness of opera in those years.p 5, \\"Tanglewood: the clash between Tradition and Change\\" Northeastern University Press (1998), by Andrew L Pincus The fact that the axis of Germany, Austria, and Italy ( the native home of opera ) became America's foremost enemy in WWII may have been a factor. Jazz was seen as a more American style. Public demand for opera seems to have been historically low in Boston in this period. The Metropolitan Opera cancelled its 1947 tour of Boston completely, and Goldovsky's company was the only local replacement available. During the war, NEC's \\"Popular Music Program\\" ( which focussed on the composition and arrangement of big band swing music ) garnered far more tuition revenue than opera instruction. Opera was expensive, and money was tight in the 1930s and 1940s. The Boston Opera House that had been built by Parkman Haven and Eben Jordan (who also built nearby NEC's Jordan Hall, Symphony Hall, and other great Boston buildings) on Boston's celebrated Culture Way was gradually lost to Boston's opera lovers over the years. By the time Goldovsky and Koussevitsky were reinvigorating Boston high culture in the forties, the building had fallen into the hands of a theatre chain who saw no profit in its original purpose. \\"The first spark of revival of interest in a potential resident company was kindled by the protean Boris Goldovsky with his New England Opera Company...\\"p280, The Boston Opera Company 1909‚Äì1915, by Quaintance Eaton, Appleton-Century Press, (1965) New York He made an earnest effort at grand opera in the old hall with his Les Troyens, but he ultimately focussed on teaching and touring. Goldovsky and the New England Conservatory's Opera aficionados were allowed some use of the hall, but it ultimately fell to the wrecking ball in 1958.Records of the Boston Opera House (1909) It stood at 343 Huntington Avenue, between Symphony Hall and the Museum of Fine Arts, near to New England Conservatory, Boston Conservatory, and the Handel and Haydn Society from 1908 to 1958.see Walter Muir Whitehill's \\"Topographical Boston\\" One of the Boston Globe critics claimed that \\"Operapathy\\" had taken hold of Boston's citizens.see p280 of Quaintance Eaton's 1965 work \\"The Boston Opera Company\\" published by Appleton-Century in New York \\"Since the 1957 demolition [sic] of the old opera house, there had been talk of a new performing arts complex....All this had come to nothing.\\" Kessler, Daniel: Sarah Caldwell: The First Woman of Opera, page 94. Scarecrow Press, 2008 \\"With the demise of the opera house, Boston was left with fading vaudeville houses and movie palaces, all with shallow stages and small orchestra pits- none ideal for opera.\\" Kessler, Daniel: Sarah Caldwell: The First Woman of Opera, page 28. Scarecrow Press, 2008 The loss of the Opera House was a great blow to the Boston Opera scene, and put the efforts of Goldovsky and the others at great disadvantage. For about forty years afterward, the perennial fulfillment of Boston's operatic aspirations was accomplished by under-financed, under-accommodated devotees in shifting and uncertain circumstances. After the demolition, \\"Goldovsky struggled on at Harvard's Loeb Theatre. There he staged his last three Boston productions...\\".page 115 \\"Measure by Measure\\" After those few performances, Goldovsky then \\"retired to the relative leisure of his NEC visiting lectureship. The Conservatory began to fret about opera and 'its need for improvement'.\\" Chicago also had an \\"opera drought\\" of about eight years beginning in 1946. Women were very important in overcoming these setbacks, but they faced some challenges. When Caldwell successfully created and staged a new production of La Finta Giardiniera in Goldovsky's shop, she believed she was left out of the tour because she was a woman.Caldwell memoir 2008 page 97 By 1955, she had decided that in some departments, she could do a better job than her mentor. The New York Times‚Äîlong after Fritz Reiner helped Margaret Hillis become a conductor in Chicago‚Äîremarked that Hillis \\"established herself as a choral conductor ... because there were virtually no orchestral conducting opportunities for women when she began her career in the 1950s\\" ( Margaret Hillis' New York Times obituary ). Hillis was a choral conductor with the New York City Opera prior to becoming the founder and conductor of the Chicago Symphony Chorus in 1957. Carol Fox founded the new Chicago Lyric Opera in 1954. At about this time (circa 1958), Sarah Caldwell started the Opera Company of Boston.Caldwell memoir 2008 page 23 The first indoor performance of the company was in 1959. She claimed‚Äîin her memoir‚Äîthat Goldovsky's \\"New England Opera Theatre\\" had been reduced to one sad production of Don Giovanni. Louise Pettitt started the Chaminade Opera Group at the same time, and the first performance was in the fall of 1959.Records of The Chaminade Opera Group The Chaminade goals were similar to those of Santa Fe. They established a scholarship to promote young talent. The Santa Fe opera was started in 1956/57 with the explicit goal of promoting the genre and developing a large pool of experienced performers. For some of these women, Tanglewood was a common thread. This summer institution of the arts was created by wealthy women of the Berkshires who invited Koussevitsky in. The famous 'shed' was established when a woman leading the organization called for donations during an rain- drenched concert. The land was donated by women. People who supported the development of women as conductors found opportunities there to foster that development. Caldwell had been a protege of Boris Goldovsky for several years prior, and of course their efforts were under the shadow of BSO's great Serge Koussevitsky, the European impresario who created Tanglewood, and who attracted so many great artists and performers to both Tanglewood and Boston. Louise sang many times at Tanglewood over the years, and sent her daughter to study under Goldovsky in 1961. Tanglewood allowed women who sought to become leaders in the field of music, and men who respected them, to work together in a non commercial setting where artistic development was the primary concern. Margaret Hillis established a Tanglewood Alumni chorus in 1950, and her conducting career was furthered by Fritz Reiner in Chicago.New York Times Aaron Copland, who was a student of Nadia Boulanger in the 1920s, helped Caldwell develop at Tanglewood in the 1950s.Caldwell memoir Copland chose Boulanger to be his composition instructor, and he became leader of the composition department at Tanglewood.p. 22,193 \\"The Selected Correspondence of Aaron Copland\\" Yale University Press (2006) Leonard Bernstein, who worked closely with Caldwell at Tanglewood in the 1950s, and became a close friend of Copland's in the 1930s, became a mentor to JoAnn Falletta. It was at Tanglewood that Goldovsky let Caldwell substitute conduct for him when he was hospitalized for an illness in the early postwar era.\\"My Road to Opera\\" by Goldovsky 1979, page 379 He ran the opera department at Tanglewood from the war years until Leinsdorf took over as BSO conductor in about 1961. Pettitt's family was sympathetic to the idea of women directors. Her son in law studied under Boulanger in Boston in the early sixties, and her husband and brother in law ( a music professor at Boston's Emerson College ) were very supportive. Her brother in law was for many years a keyboardist at Tanglewood. He was also Caldwell's assistant in the opera department, 1950‚Äì52, and helped Alice Taylor create the Oakland Opera in the 1970s.Robert Pettitt's Boston Globe Obituary, September 12, 2010 Pettitt's hometown friend, Robert Rounseville, who also studied at Tanglewood, was a lifelong friend and supporter of Mrs Pettitt. He starred in the world premiere of Stravinsky's \\"Rake's Progress\\" in Europe, before Caldwell brought Stravinsky to BU to conduct the US premiere. Another male advocate in the Boston Symphony Orchestra / Tanglewood community was Pettitt's lifelong friend, violinist Sheldon Rotenberg, who was hired by Koussevitsky in 1948, and stayed with the BSO until 1991.Boston Globe, August 16, 1991 by Richard Dyer ‚Äì \\"The BSO is losing its last links to Koussevitsky\\" He was brought to Tanglewood from Leopold Stokowski's National Youth Orchestra.page 99 \\"An Eye For Music\\" 1949 by Martha Burnham Humphrey, published by HM Teich, Boston One other factor to mention is the cold war. The launching of Sputnik epitomized a new cold war rivalry that extended to culture and even to classical music. Van Cliburn's 1958 victory in the first quadrennial Tchaikovsky piano competition in Moscow won him a ticker tape parade in Manhattan, among other things. The American impulse to excel in the arts was stimulated in the late 1950s in part by Soviet triumphalism. This was part of the backdrop to the founding of the Chaminade Opera Group, but the very few women who conducted opera in America in the 1950s faced other challenges that were more immediate, and more cumbersome.  Founding of Chaminade Opera Group  In 1958, a year before the founding of the company, Mrs Pettitt directed a limited production of Mozart's \\"Cosi Fan Tutte\\" at a small venue, with double piano accompaniment instead of orchestra. The following year she commenced the first official season of the new company with Humperdinck's H√§nsel und Gretel. During her long tenure Mrs Pettitt served in three roles: orchestra conductor, vocal director and dramatic director. She probably did so for a longer, unbroken period than any other American woman. The difficulty of this challenge was illustrated by Boris Goldovsky, who pursued a career as a conductor before becoming an opera lover. In his first conducting class with Fritz Reiner, he was confronted with the notion that an art form he despised (Goldovsky as a student loathed opera) comprised the most difficult and demanding form of conducting. Reiner reportedly said to Goldovsky in his conducting class at the Curtis Institute: \\"Anybody can beat time evenly and it's nothing to be proud of...I'm not going to waste your time and mine teaching you easy things. What I'm going to do first is teach you how to conduct operatic recitatives. Because until you've conducted opera, you don't know what conducting really is\\" (see page 155 \\"My Road to Opera\\" by Goldovsky). Reiner forced Goldovsky to coach the opera singers at Curtis in operatic repertoire, the better to prepare him to be a great conductor. And Goldovsky dedicated his book to three men: Fritz Reiner, Ernst Lert, and Serge Koussevitzky. So for Mrs Pettitt to have discharged all three responsibilities (orchestra director, dramatic director, singing director) for such a long period of time is a singular and extraordinary achievement. Thirty two years after the founding of Chaminade, the Taunton Daily Gazette wrote that \\"Long before Sarah Caldwell in Boston or New York's Beverly Sills directed opera companies, there was Louise Pettitt in Attleboro\\" (Taunton Daily Gazette, Sat Feb 23, 1991, by Nancy C Doyle ). This praise was half right. Louise Pettitt preceded Beverly Sills by many years. Sills took over as General Director of the NYCO in 1980.Anthony Tommasini (July 2, 2007). \\"Beverly Sills, Acclaimed Soprano, Dies at 78\\". The New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/02/arts/03cnd-03Sills.html?scp=2&sq;=beverly%20sills&st;=cse. Retrieved May 20, 2009. But Louise was a contemporary of Caldwell. In Chicago, beginning in 1954, Fox was running the Lyric Opera and engaging artists like Maria Callas. But few women in the US were running opera companies when Mrs Pettitt took the helm of Chaminade, and the consistency of her multiple responsibility is notable. Caldwell herself often did not conduct the orchestra in her independent productions. Perhaps no other woman in America so consistently and enduringly performed both as conductor and director as did Mrs Pettitt.Mary Garden was the director of the Chicago Civic Opera beginning in 1922, but she was a British immigrant, and only served about 10 years. There were few opera companies at all in the United States in 1958. Of those, there were few founded by women, and of those, there were fewer still with a woman serving as both conductor and dramatic director. She was certainly a leader, and a pioneer. The New England Conservatory's alumni notes claim that Caldwell was \\"the second woman ever to conduct the New York Philharmonic (1974), and the third woman ever to lead an American opera company\\"presumably the other two are Mary Garden and Carol Fox, both in Chicago (see Caldwell alumni profile).Outside of the United States, there were a few: Emma Carelli in Rome, Maria Llacer in Madrid, Kirsten Flagstad in Oslo. See page xiv of \\"The Last Prima Donnas\\" 1982 by Rasponi, Alfred A. Knopf, New York Certainly the foundation of a successful opera company in the 1950s by an American woman would have been highly unusual. The works chosen by Mrs Pettitt for her first four seasons did not stray from the standard canon of favorites. After H√§nsel und Gretel, a well-known piece then‚Äîwith which she and her audience were familiar‚Äîthe next three seasons were devoted to Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte, Magic Flute, and Marriage of Figaro. Her choices later become more daring and ambitious.  1964‚Äì1990: Innovation and Exploration  By 1964, Mrs Pettitt was able to incorporate members of the Boston Ballet company into her production of Song Of Norway, an opera about the famous European composer, Edvard Grieg (Providence Journal, November 8, 1964). Her daughter sang that same year with Joan Sutherland in Caldwell's production of \\"I Puritani\\" in Boston. At this point, international stars started coming to Boston, including Renata Tebaldi, Pl√°cido Domingo, and Sutherland. Her later productions still included works by Mozart, Puccini, Verdi, Donizetti, Johann Strauss, in addition to Offenbach, Bizet, Leh√°r, and Britten. But as her confidence and appetite grew, and emboldened by applause, she gradually opened the repertoire to less familiar composers, like Boito, Smetana, Massenet, Gounod and others. And this opening of the repertoire mirrored groundbreaking work happening across the world of opera in those years. And her ability to draw bright young talent grew. After more than a dozen years of experience, the Chaminade Opera Group was reaching new heights in the 1970s, recruiting well established professionals and receiving praise in the press. Turnout was often standing room only, and the group was forced to add extra performances to accommodate the rising interest (Attleboro Sun Chronicle, December 7, 1973). The frequent participation of a photogenic young Miss Massachusetts named Deborah O'Brien may have also drawn some of the additional interest.Deborah was the 1971 winner In 1977, Greater Boston's Patriot Ledger newspaper compared Mrs Pettitt's production of Mephistopheles favorably to those of Sarah Caldwell (The Patriot Ledger, Wednesday December 14, 1977). Critic Sue Cromwell wrote that \\"Sarah Caldwell fans, presumably waiting patiently for the Opera Company of Boston's new season to begin, missed the kind of performance that is their meat and drink\\", adding that \\"Sarah's seasoned fans would have torn the house down.\\" John Bates, of Caldwell's \\"Opera Company of Boston\\" served as Pettitt's young \\"Wagner\\" in the Chaminade effort. Cromwell noted that \\"...the same kinds of strengths and weaknesses appear to prevail with both the professional Caldwell company and the semi-pro Chaminade.\\" Over the years, several people who sang for her company also sang for the Caldwell company.Including Benjamin Cox, Jeanine Kelley, \\"Jack\\" Bates, \\"Bill\\" Cashman, and others. See Records of the Chaminade Opera Company Mrs Pettitt's own daughter Pamela sang with both the Caldwell Company and Chaminade Opera Group. Peter Feldman, who had toured six times with the Goldovsky Institute (see Boris Goldovsky), played the title role in Chaminade's Mephistopheles, and personally translated his entire role from the original Italian libretto for the Chaminade production. Mr Bates served in several Caldwell and Pettitt productions. In 1985 and 1987, Louise directed baritone Donald Wilkinson, who now teaches at Harvard and MIT.See Donald Wilkinson's website His experience clearly shows the value of her company regionally as a promoter of opera. These achievements were valuable to the opera community at large, but many of the early promoters of opera, like Goldovsky and Pettitt, gradually found themselves surrounded by well financed competitors. By the late 1970s, the number of opera companies in the country had vastly increased, to the point that the Metropolitan Opera Guild tried to conduct a sort of census. The opera 'drought' of the 1940s was clearly long gone. The Chaminade Opera Group was now one of many companies.  Boston Opera in crisis of 1990: Pettitt temporarily takes mantle from the faltering Caldwell  Sarah Caldwell's Boston company gradually fell apart, and by 1990, Tanglewood's opera department had long since been pared back by the BSO trustees. Eric Leinsdorf had fired Goldovsky from Tanglewood in the early 1960s, and abolished the opera department there. It wasn't until the mid-1990s that Seiji Ozawa re-introduced opera at Tanglewood on an equal basis with the other genres.p140, \\"Tanglewood: the clash between tradition and change\\" by Andrew L Pincus, Northeastern University Press (1998) \\"Sarah's 1989 production of Leonard Bernstein's Mass was her last effort that could be ranked as a piece of innovative theater,...\\".Kessler 2008 p175 \\"Although buoyed by the success of Mass, by the time 1990 rolled around, Sarah was on the cusp of her last Boston season, her company tottering on the edge of financial ruin with little hope of rescue.\\"Kessler 2008 p. 177 See an explanation of her difficulties in \\"Sarah Caldwell, Indomitable Director of the Opera Company of Boston, Dies at 82\\" article by Anthony Tommasini, New York Times March 25, 2006. The last performance of her company in its own theater was June 17, 1990.Kessler 2008 p179 Her theatre was shuttered for building code violations in December 1990. By this point Mrs Pettitt's company‚Äîa more enduring institution‚Äîfound itself thriving in Boston. In January of that year, the Boston Opera Company (not Caldwell's \\"Opera Company of Boston\\") featured Mrs Pettitt's production of Bizet's Pearl Fishers in the Strand Theater in Boston. With the support of the City of Boston, the federal Economic Development Administration, and Community Development Block Grant money, the Strand was saved and renovated in the late 1970s. While Boston City Hall backed revitalization of the Strand, with help from community groups, it has not been primarily used as an opera house since the re-opening. But when the Caldwell organization faltered, it provided shelter to the Chaminade group. Richard Dyer, the eminent Globe columnist who presided at New England Conservatory's 2008 centennial of Boris Goldovsky (recounting tales of Boston Opera from the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s along with international stars Phyllis Curtin, George Shirley, Sherrill Milnes, Rosalind Elias, Justino Diaz and local luminaries such as John Moriarty and many others) lionized Mrs Pettitt and her company for their efforts in the 1990 production.Boston Globe Jan 20, 1990 p11 Among the professional performers onstage in the 1990 Pettitt production was Deborah Sasson (ibid). Deborah was born in Boston, and having worked with Mrs Pettitt and Seiji Ozawa, she has moved on to become a celebrated European performer. Pettitt's collaborators that year included Randall J. Kulunis, who at the time saw the failure of the Caldwell efforts and the loss of Caldwell's venue as an opportunity to resurrect the original plans of the original Huntington Street Boston Opera House (1909) and put fully staged opera once again in a proper Boston hall. Pettitt's company cooperated in this noble venture, although no resurrection occurred. Dyer hailed the effort. In the narrative of Boston Opera history, this may have been the highwater mark for Mrs Pettitt and her Chaminade group. But she continued using Boston singers in her productions for many more years, and continued to draw on the Boston Opera community for talent, ticket sales, inspiration, and collaboration. Not only did she and her Chaminade Opera Group continue staging operas long after the folding of Caldwell's company, but they also established a broad repertoire of oratorio works, including Mendelssohn's Elijah, Carl Orff's Carmina Burana, and many famous and lesser known requiems and masses. Her favorite requiem was Brahms' German Requiem and Chaminade Opera Group singers performed it several times as an oratorio piece under the direction of Mrs Pettitt. They also maintained Chaminade's opera scholarship. Perhaps it was her longevity or reputation‚Äîor successes‚Äîthat finally brought a representative of the New York Times to review a night of her work, toward the twilight of her sixty years in musical performance. But the Times was really unprepared to measure her pioneering efforts and her service to the popular propagation of high culture in America. Nor were they even prepared to review the creative and artistic innovations of her career. Anthony Tommasini, the great New York Times expert‚Äîwho literally wrote the (best-selling) book on opera‚Äîreviewed a belabored production of hers in the 1990s and found it charming, and warm, but riddled with weakness. The semi-professional tenor had a weak high range. The woodwinds seemed \\"under- rehearsed.\\" Mr Tommasini could not recommend that particular show to his readers, and evinced incognizance of both her early role as a pioneering woman and her long regional importance in fostering generations of experienced singers. Mrs Pettitt was by then in her late seventies, and American opera was no longer the desolate wilderness of so many years before. The catalogues of companies, stars, venues and repertoires had become lengthy, surfeited. She had always provided probative opportunity on evidence of good faith where she witnessed promising talent in league with high enthusiasm. In the case of Sasson and others, the opportunity was well requited. On a budget of almost zero, working long hours for no pay, in a nonprofit, in the interest of promoting unproven ability, it would be inappropriate to judge her efforts by the performance standards of the Metropolitan Opera, or La Scala. And yet, having pioneered the introduction of fully staged opera into the mainstream of civic life in America, and having done so without supportive academic incubation (like by Boston University for Caldwell) or prolonged mentoring (like Goldovsky for Caldwell) during a time when American women were effectively barred from leadership in all fields, Mrs Pettitt found herself finally surrounded by the field of well supported competitors she had always sought to engender (the same is true for Goldovsky, who made such a case in his memoir: see Boris Goldovsky), and still refused to deny opportunity to the unproven, and the unfinished. Mr Tommasini sought to judge her narrowly, within the facile intellectual confines of mere technical pedantry. He was truly unqualified to take her measure. Although age and illness (particularly that of her lifelong love George Arthur Pettitt) gradually began to affect her productiveness in the new millennium, she maintained an incontrovertible optimism and resolve. Her teaching and rehearsal schedules exhibited the same relentless diligence as previously. On the day she died, she was awaiting several voice students, and was three weeks into a six-week schedule for an upcoming choral concert (supporting Chaminade). She died on March 25, 2006 at her home in Massachusetts, about ten weeks after her partner of 65 years.Boston Globe obituary, April 2, 2006 She outlived Sarah Caldwell‚Äîa very similar woman‚Äîby exactly two days. An archive of her work and that of the Chaminade Opera Group is being assembled under the auspices of Wheaton College, Norton Massachusetts.  Her conducting credits with Chaminade include the following  * The Marriage of Figaro by Mozart * The Magic Flute by Mozart * Cos√¨ Fan Tutte by Mozart * Die Fledermaus by Strauss * Eine Nacht in Venedig (A Night in Venice) by Strauss * The Tales of Hoffman by Offenbach * La P√©richole by Offenbach * La Traviata by Verdi * Otello by Verdi * The Pearl Fishers by Bizet * Carmen by Bizet * The Gondoliers by Gilbert & Sullivan * The Mikado by Gilbert & Sullivan * Turandot by Puccini * L'Elisir D'Amore by Donizetti * The Merry Widow by Leh√°r * The Bartered Bride by Smetana * Manon by Massenet * Mephistopheles by Boito * Faust by Gounod * The Ballad of Baby Doe by Moore * The Merry Wives of Windsor by Nicolai * The Song of Norway by Robert Wright and George Forrest (see Grieg) * Hansel and Gretel by Humperdinck  Chaminade actors include  Deborah Sasson. Deborah was born in Boston and studied at Oberlin Conservatory. She sang with the New York Metropolitan Opera early in her career. She had her Broadway debut in Showboat. She was introduced to the Hamburg Staatsoper by Leonard Bernstein, and as her website says: \\"Das war der Beginn ihrer deutsche Karriere.\\" She has sung at Vienna, in Rio de Janeiro, Los Angeles and Venice, inter alia; She sang with the London Symphony Orchestra. She has appeared in numerous European television specials, alongside Jos√© Carreras and others. Among the highlights of her career, she mentions performing in Japan with Seiji Ozawa, and performing Mahler's 8th Symphony under his direction with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall in New York. Donald Wilkinson performed for the Chaminade Opera Group in 1985 and 1987, early in his opera career. He has performed under the direction of Seiji Ozawa with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He was awarded a Tanglewood fellowship. He teaches voice at Harvard and MIT. He has sung across Europe. Benjamin Cox, Jeanine Kelley, and Jack Bates were all from Caldwell's Opera Company of Boston;Records of Chaminade Opera Group William \\"Bill\\" Cashman performed professionally in Caldwell's Opera Company of Boston (January 1973 ‚Äì May 1979) and in Pettitt's Chaminade Opera Group. He also performed at the Louise Pettitt memorial concert. Jon Berberian trained with the New York City Opera. Peter Feldman. Peter toured six seasons with Boris Goldovsky of Goldovsky Institute; He studied at Boston University's opera program 1957‚Äì1961. He performed under stage direction by Sarah Caldwell and Boris Goldovsky. He performed at the New York City Opera, among others. James Van Der Post, who has sung opera in companies across the United States and in Europe; Randall Kulunis. Randall studied at the Boston Conservatory Opera Department under legendary mentor John Moriarty, and at New England Conservatory under Boris Goldovsky. He and his brother at one point recovered the plans of the old Boston Opera House (1909), intending to rebuild it. Deborah O'Brien (the 1971 Miss Massachusetts, and an associate of the Opera Company of Boston); Michael Popowich of the Santa Fe Opera. Michael Duarte, a longtime friend and collaborator of Mrs Pettitt's, and a lead in several of her productions, is expected to take her place within Chaminade Opera as director.

The original line-up consisted of David Owens (vocals), Gary Owens (guitar), Cam Campbell (bass), Karl Reti (drums). For a short time they were one of the forerunners of the new wave of British heavy metal movement. They disbanded in 1982. Career Manchester's A II Z (named after the A‚ÄìZ Street Atlas) were the beneficiaries of fortuitous timing, being formed by brothers Dave (vocals) and Gary Owens (guitar), Cam Campbell (bass), and Karl Reti (drums), just in time (late 1979) to be swept up by the initial excitement surrounding the new wave of British heavy metal. Immediately signed by major label Polydor, the group, whose style bore resemblances to Mot√∂rhead, Sweet Savage and Weapon, recorded their 1980 debut album, The Witch of Berkeley, live at a hometown gig (actually the hall of Hazel Grove High School), then were sent out on the road in support of Girlschool (Iron Maiden) and Black Sabbath. Neither of these experiences aided record sales, however, and following the release by Polydor of 1981's \\"No Fun After Midnight\\" EP and the single \\"I'm the One Who Loves You\\", the band were dropped. Internal dissension had also taken root by this time and the Owens had dispensed with their original rhythm section to work with new bassist Tony Backhouse and drummer Simon Wright (later of AC/DC) on that final single. But the quartet's new and more commercial AOR direction failed to bear fruit, and by the middle of 1982 A II Z had dissolved. Guitarist Gary Owens joined the similarly ill-fated NWOBHM band Tytan. In 1993, Reborn Classics reissued The Witch of Berkeley as a bootleg CD which includes both singles as well as a four-track demo from Jaguar.

According to Jewish law, such a person must be killed by any bystander after being warned to stop and refusing. A source for this law appears in the Babylonian Talmud: > And these are the ones whom one must save even with their lives [i.e., > killing the wrongdoer]: one who pursues his fellow to kill him [rodef achar > chavero le-horgo], and after a male or a betrothed maiden [to rape them]; > but one who pursues an animal, or desecrates the Sabbath, or commits > idolatry are not saved with their lives.Babylonian Talmud, Tractate > Sanhedrin 73a This law, the din rodef (\\"law of the pursuer\\"), is significant as one of the few provisions in Jewish law permitting extrajudicial killings. The allowance to kill the rodef does not apply, however, in a case where lesser means would prevent the innocent's murder.Sanhedrin 74a Furthermore, according to the Rambam, killing a rodef who may have been stopped by lesser means constitutes murder, though the punishment for a murderer in this case is not dealt out by beit din.Rambam, Hilchot Rotzei‚Äôach 1:6,7  Modern controversy  = Yitzhak Rabin = In recent years, a number of rabbis have allegedly suggested that various public figures could qualify as rodfim, arguably encouraging one to kill. Perhaps most notoriously, former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was branded a rodef by some for the Oslo Accord, an agreement for which he was assassinated in 1995. The assassin, Yigal Amir, subsequently justified his actions partly on the basis of din rodef, under the assumption that making concessions to the Palestinian Authority would endanger Jewish lives. \\\\ Excerpted from Terror in the Name of God: Why Religious Militants Kill, . The Oslo Accords were controversial within Israel and divided the population due to the extensive change in government policy regarding negotiations with then Israeli designated terrorist organizations, such as the PLO. According to Rabbi Arthur Waskow, Yigal Amir's interpretation of din rodef is a gross distortion of Jewish law and tradition. > First of all, the law of the pursuer only applies to a spontaneous act, > whereas Yigal Amir planned this assassination for two years. Secondly, the > law of the pursuer is only intended to save a potential victim from imminent > death. There is absolutely no proof that withdrawing from certain > territories will directly lead to the death of any Jews. On the contrary, > Prime Minister Rabin, over half the members of the Knesset, and over half > the population of Israel believe exactly the opposite ‚Äì that it will save > Jewish lives. Lastly, this law does not refer to elected representatives, > for if Yitzhak Rabin was really a pursuer, then so are all his followers and > that would mean that Amir should have killed over half the population of > Israel! In other words, even according to the law of the pursuer, this act > was totally futile and senseless since the peace process will > continue.\\"Rabbinic response: Jewish Law on the Killing of Yitzhak Rabin\\", by > Rabbi Arthur Waskow, The Shalom Center, 11/14/2005 = Avigdor Nebenzahl = Other instances have occurred. In 2005, for instance, prominent Israeli Rabbi Avigdor Nebenzahl stated that \\"it should be known that anyone who wants to give away Israeli land is like a rodef\\", triggering an outcry and a special debate in the Knesset. = Geoffrey Alderman = In 2009, Jewish historian Geoffrey Alderman engaged in another controversy when he argued that, according to Jewish religious law, every Palestinian in Gaza who voted for Hamas was a legitimate target. He articulated his position in a debate with rabbi David J Goldberg in The Guardians commentary section.Geoffrey Alderman v David Goldberg: Can Israeli actions in Gaza be justified on the basis of Jewish scripture? - The Guardian He argues that according to the Halakha, \\"it is entirely legitimate to kill a rodef ‚Äì that is to say, one who endangers the life of another ‚Äì and this is true, incidentally, even if the rodef has not yet actually taken another life\\". Furthermore, he argues that > It seems clear to me from a commonsense reading of this passage [Babylonian > Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin, folio 73a] that the concept of a rodef > encompasses those who advocate or incite the murder of Jews.

Education Born in Fredericton, New Brunswick, the son of Cora Elizabeth Hewitson and Charles Duff Ross, Ross attended Fredericton High School before receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and Philosophy from the University of New Brunswick in 1933. He received a Master of Arts degree from the University of Toronto in 1934 and a Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1941. Academic career Prior to receiving his Ph.D. from Cornell, he had lectured there in its English department. From 1941-42, Ross taught at Indiana University-Bloomington. From 1945 to 1950, he taught at the University of Manitoba. In 1949, Ross received a Guggenheim Fellowship and spent six months studying at Harvard University and six months writing Poetry & dogma: the transfiguration of eucharistic symbols in seventeenth century English poetry in Pasadena, California. He was a professor of English at Queen's University. He was head of the Department of English from 1957 to 1960 and held the James Cappon Professorship in English from 1960 to 1962. In 1962, he went to the University of Toronto and was the Dean of Arts from 1962 to 1968. From 1968 to 1982, he was a professor and a Thomas McCulloch Professor at Dalhousie University. He was also among the original Editorial Advisors of the scholarly journal Dionysius. Other career activities He founded the New Canadian Library imprint, published by McClelland and Stewart, and for several years was its general editor. In 2007 the University of Toronto Press published New Canadian Library: The Ross-McClelland Years, 1952-1978, a work by Janet Beverly Friskney that provides an account of the New Canadian Library during the years of Ross's editorship. He served on the Canada Council, where he was a chief policymaker. In Strange Bedfellows: The State and the Arts in Canada, George Woodcock relates a weekend he spent with Ross, Alex Colville, Dennis Lee, Gratien Gelinas, Pierre Trottier, and R. Murray Schafer as guests of Governor General Jules Leger at Rideau Hall in the autumn of 1976 to discuss and formulate a policy for the arts and culture in Canada. The World War II years John Grierson, the head of the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), asked Malcolm Ross to become the Head of Distribution at the NFB in 1942. There Ross's job was to supervise the distribution of all NFB productions, both theatrical and nontheatrical. This included rural, industrial, and trade union circuits, the preview library, and relations with volunteer projection services. He was also responsible for all foreign distribution and the translation of Canadian films into the leading European languages. He was also involved in advising the making of many propaganda films and, therefore, got to know directors such as Joris Ivens who did Action Stations and Corvette Port Arthur for the NFB. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) awarded a special Oscar for the work that the NFB did during World War II. In 1945, when Grierson was preparing to leave the NFB, he suggested Ross as one of three possibilities for his replacement; however, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King decided instead to downsize the NFB since the war was over.Gary Evans.

He was very active in resisting Portuguese colonial inroads into Sri Lanka. He also inherited his throne via palace intrigues in which number of heirs apparent died under mysterious circumstances. At the end, he was removed from power by a local uprising that led to his son Puviraja Pandaram taking nominal power from him. Biography His father, Singai Pararasasegaram, had two principal wives and a number of concubines. His first wife, Rajalaksmi, had two sons, Singhabahu and Pandaram. Singai Pararasasegaram second wife was Valliammal, she bore him Paranirupasingham. Cankili's mother had Cankili and a daughter named Paravai. As part of palace intrigues, Cankili was able to ascend the throne.  Rule  According to a letter by Andre de Souza, ordered Cankili I on November 1544 the murder of his eldest son for converting to Catholicism. The son was buried on the spot he was killed, where a chapel was built that later on served as the foundation for the construction of the present St. Mary's Cathedral at Jaffna.

Batman's boats =Batskiboat= The Batskiboat is a version of the Batboat in the 1992 live-action film Batman Returns. Batman uses the jet-powered hydrofoil near the climax of the film to travel through Gotham's sewer system towards the Penguin's lair. The Batskiboat's design is a cross between the film's Batmobile, a Killer whale and the figure of a shark. It is a single-seater and has the same extras as the Batmobile, including torpedo launchers. It also has a radar, which can be used by Batman to monitor each area of Gotham City. =Batstrike= The Batstrike is a neutral-buoyancy undersea scooter. The Batstrike carries submerged speeds in excess of 5 knots. =Batsub= The Bat- Submersible (or \\"Batsub\\") made its debut in May 1949 in Detective Comics #147. Batman and Robin employed the Bat-Sub in order to net Tiger Shark. The Batsub (or Bat-Sub) is another fictional watercraft along with the Batboat used by the comic superhero Batman for alternative transportation purposes. In the 1995 film Batman Forever, a version of the Batwing is shown to have a cockpit that can transform into a submersible vehicle should the air vehicle be shot down. This mini submarine does not have armament and is only equipped with a search headlight. Environment systems include CO2-scrubbers and air- conditioning units in the Bat-Submersible's stern. Oxygen tanks provide up to six hours of breathable air. There are also emergency tanks that allow an added twelve hours of life-support. The life-support includes oxygen/helium mixes for deep-water submersion. Publication history In Sub-Level 6 of the Batcave, there's an aqua-dynamic hydrofoil/submersible (otherwise known as the Batboat) on both the navigable Gotham River and the Atlantic Ocean's waters. =Background= Early in his career, while investigating arms dealers operating along the wharves of Gotham City's Chinatown district, Batman used a prototype Batboat to pursue the fleeing criminals. In what was later regarded as an \\"extreme measure\\", Batman destroyed their launch with a bow-mounted flame-thrower. The first official Batboat made its debut in April 1946 (in Detective Comics #110). The storyline involved Scotland Yard providing Batman and Robin with the boat in order to speed their search for the villainous Professor Moriarty. =Hydrofoil= To submerge, the Batboat's foils retract to reduce parasitic drag. Its aluminum propellers are driven by sealed electrolyte batteries. =Cockpit= The Batboat displays include state-of- the-art 'at-a-glance' navigation and communication links, an ascent-rate alarm, a dive-time clock, and a safe-ceiling depth meter. =Offensive weapons= Batboat's armaments include a pneumatic harpoon, a launching grapnel, depth charges and active-homing torpedoes. Television and film =1960s Batman= Batman (1966). The first appearance of the Batboat was in the 1966 film Batman. It was subsequently used in seasons two and three of the 1960s Batman television series. It was created by Glastron Industries. Since Glastron was based in Austin, Texas, the world premiere of the 1966 \\"Batman\\" movie was also held there. Mel Whitley and Robert Hammond designed the Batboat from a Glastron V-174. They added a red flashing beacon, glowing eyes, bazooka hatches, seats for both Batman and Robin at the front of the boat, twin wind screens, a center console, an outdrive jet cover, and an aft to deck cover with a glowing Bat-Signal on the tail fin. Although the boat was powered by a Merc Cruiser L-6 stern drive and Attwood Corporation manufactured the hardwire, a water squirter and a jet nozzle were added to make the Batboat look like it was nuclear-powered. It took 31 days to build. Eventually, a replica was built of the Batboat. When the Batman television show was cancelled, Glastron used the two Batboats for promotions on tours. After much touring, the boats were sold. One boat went to a Glastron dealer who was a Shriner. He used it in various Shriner parades. This Batboat was then moved to the Car Stars museum in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. =Batman: The Animated Series= The Batboat was also featured in Batman: The Animated Series. It could also be used as a submarine. =Batman Returns= A darker version was used in Batman Returns as the Batskiboat. Batman uses the vehicle near the climax of the film to travel through Gotham's sewer system towards the Penguin's lair. =Batman Forever= A second Batboat appears in the film Batman Forever, piloted by Robin, and is quickly destroyed by the Riddler and Two-Face. In the same film, a version of the Batwing is shown to have a cockpit that can transform into a submersible vehicle should the air vehicle be shot down. =The Batman= The Batboat is also used in The Batman. This one has similarity to the Batskiboat but it has black and blue color. This version somehow gives this boat the appearance that it is hovering over the water rather than touching it. It holds three people and is equipped with an on-board computer which can be activated from his belt. It has submersible capabilities like in Batman: The Animated Series. In \\"The Icy Depth\\", when trapped in ice it can generate enough heat to break through the ice. =Batman Beyond= A submarine appeared in the episode \\"Earth Mover\\" in Batman Beyond. It was used by Terry McGinnis, the new Batman, to navigate Gotham city's underground rivers. =Superman/Batman: Apocalypse= The Bat Skiboat makes an appearance early in Superman/Batman: Apocalypse. =Lego Batman: The Movie - DC Super Heroes Unite= The Batboat makes an appearance in Lego Batman: The Movie - DC Super Heroes Unite.

Gameplay  Beast Busters is a rail shooter wherein the player shoots zombies. In the game, players control one of three militiamen named Johnny Justice, Paul Patriot and Sammy Stately, who must shoot their way out of a city that has been invaded by the undead. The original arcade machine allows for up to three players to play the game at the same time. Guns are mounted to the machine and look like machine guns. Players can earn a number of power-ups through the course of each stage to aid them in battle such as rockets, grenades, armor, health packs, and ammo. The game has seven sections for players to shoot their way through. In between stages players are shown cutscenes explaining the events of the zombie infestation that has overtaken the city. Each stage has a sub boss as well as an end boss to defeat, all of which have 2 forms to defeat. The game was known for having unusual bosses, such as a zombie punk who mutates into a dog, or a jeep which starts coming to life. One stage ends with the militiamen having to rescue a female CIA agent from that stage's boss.  Spinoffs and sequels  A sequel entitled Beast Busters: Second Nightmare was released in 1999 on the Hyper Neo Geo 64. A handheld spin-off called Dark Arms: Beast Buster was released in 1999 for the Neo Geo Pocket Color in the form of an Action RPG. December 22, 2014 for iOS and Android devices. This game is a crossover in celebration of the 25th and 20th anniversaries of the Beast Busters and The King of Fighters series, respectively.

Family She was the third daughter of Franz Frederick Anton, Duke of Saxe- Coburg-Saalfeld and Countess Augusta Caroline Reuss of Ebersdorf. King Leopold I of the Belgians was her younger brother, while Queen Victoria of United Kingdom was her niece and King Ferdinand II of Portugal was her great nephew. Grand Duchess of Russia =Marriage Plans= Empress Catherine II of Russia began to search a suitable wife for her second grandson, Grand Duke Konstantin after the marriage of her eldest grandson, Grand Duke Alexander, with Louise of Baden in 1793. The empress spoke of pride about the young grand duke as an enviable match for many brides in Europe, as he was the second in line to succession to the Russian Empire. Soon a marriage offer arrived from the court of Naples: King Ferdinand I and Queen Maria Carolina suggested a marriage between the Grand Duke and one of their many daughters, which the Empress immediately rejected. In 1795, General Andrei Budberg was sent in a secret mission to the ruling European courts, to find a bride for Konstantin. He had a huge list of candidates, but during his trip became ill and was forced to stay in Coburg. He was attended by the Ducal court doctor, Baron Stockmar, who, once he knew the real intention of his trip, drew the general's attention to the daughters of Duke Franz. Budberg wrote to Saint Petersburg that he found the perfect candidates, without visiting any other courts. After a little consideration, Empress Catherine II consented. Duchess Augusta, once she knew that one of her daughters would be a Grand Duchess of Russia, was delighted with the idea: a marriage with the Imperial Russian dynasty could bring huge benefits for the relatively small German Duchy of Saxe-Coburg- Saalfeld. However, in Europe there were other views; for example, Charles- Fran√ßois-Philibert Masson, in his Secrets Memoirs of the court of Saint- Petersburg wrote about the unenviable role of German brides in the Russian court: :Young touching victim, which Germany sends as a tribute to Russia, as did Greece who sent their maids to the Minotaur... =Life in Russia= Grand Duchess Anna Feodorovna of Russia, early 1800s Juliane, along with her mother and two elder sisters, Sophie and Antoinette, travelled to Saint Petersburg at the request of Empress Catherine II of Russia. After the first meeting, the Empress wrote: \\"The Duchess of Saxe-Coburg was beautiful and worthy of respect among women, and her daughters are pretty. It's a pity that our groom must choose only one, would be good to keep all three. But it seems that our Paris give the apple to the younger one, you'll see that he would prefer Julia among the sisters...she's really the best choice.\\" However, Prince Adam Czartoryski, in his Memoirs, wrote: :He was given an order by the Empress to marry one of the princesses, and he was given a choice of his future wife. This point of view was confirmed by Countess Varvara Golovina, who also wrote: :After three weeks, the Grand Duke Konstantin was forced to make a choice. I think that he did not want to marry. After the young Grand Duke chose Juliane,Alexander Jordis-Lohausen: Mitteleuropa 1658-2008- die Chronik einer Familie, GRIN Verlag, 2009, p. 58. she began her training as a consort. On 2 February 1796, the 14-year-old German princess took the name of Anna Fyodorovna in a Russian Orthodox baptismal ceremony and 20 days later, on 26 February, she and Konstantin were married. The Empress died nine months later, on 6 November. By virtue of her wedding, she was awarded with the Grand Cross of the Imperial Order of Saint Catherine and the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem.Adre√üHandbuch des Herzogthums Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha, Meusel, 1854, p. 13. This union, in connection with the wedding of her brother Leopold with Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales, made the little Duchy of Saxe-Coburg the dynastic heart of Europe. In addition, thanks to relations with the Russian Empire, Saxe-Coburg was relatively safe during the Napoleonic Wars. However, on a personal level, the marriage was deeply unhappy. Konstantin, known to be a violent man and fully dedicated to his military career, made his young wife intensely miserable.Neuer Plutarch: oder, Bildnisse und Biographien der ber√ºhmtesten M√§nner und Frauen aller Nationen und St√§nde; von den √§ltern bis auf unsere Zeiten. According to reliable sources, edited by a scholar societies, CA Hartleben, 1853, vol. V, p. 128. In the meanwhile, the young grand duchess began to grow up and became more and more attractive to the Russian court, who nicknamed her the \\"Rising Star\\". This made Konstantin extremely jealous, even of his own brother Alexander. He forbade Anna to leave her room, and when she had the opportunity to come out, Konstantin took her away. Countess Golovina recalled: The married life of Anna Fyodorovna was hard and impossible to maintain [...] in her modesty, she needed the friendship of Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden, wife of her brother-in-law Alexander), who was able to smooth things out between the frequent quarrelling spouses...\\". During the difficult years in the Russian court, Anna became close to Grand Duchess Elizabeth, of similar age. In 1799 Anna left Russia for medical treatment and didn't want to return. She went to her family in Coburg; however, they didn't support her, as they feared for the reputation of the Ducal family and their finances. Anna left Coburg to have a water cure; but at the same time, the St Petersburg's court made their own plans. Under the pressure of the Imperial family and her own relatives, the Grand Duchess was forced to return to Russia. In October 1799 the weddings of Grand Duchesses Alexandra and Elena were celebrated. Anna was forced to attend. The assassination of Emperor Paul I on 23 March 1801 gave Anna an opportunity to carry out her plan to escape. By August of that year, her mother was informed that the grand duchess was seriously ill. Once informed about her daughter's health, Duchess Augusta came to visit her. In order to have a better treatment she took Anna to Coburg, with the consent of both the new Emperor Alexander I and Grand Duke Konstantin. Once she arrived to her homeland, Anna refused to come back. She never returned to Russia. Life after separation Almost immediately after her return to Coburg, Anna began negotiations for a divorce from her husband. Grand Duke Konstantin wrote in response to her letter: :You write to me that I allowed you to go into foreign lands because we are incompatible and because I can't give you the love which you need. But humbly I ask you to calm yourself in consideration to our lives together, besides all these facts confirm in writing, and that in addition to this other reason you don't have. By 1803 the divorce was still refused, because Dowager Empress Maria Fyodorovna feared that her son Konstantin could contract a second morganatic marriage, and the official separation would damage the reputation of the grand duchess. At first, the grand duchess feared an unfavorable opinion about her conduct among the European courts; however, they showed their sympathy. Still legally married, Anna, eager to have a family, found solace in clandestine affairs. Grand Duchess Anna Fyodorovna. Portrait by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, 1848. On 28 October 1808, Anna gave birth to an illegitimate son, named Eduard Edgar Schmidt-L√∂we. The father of this child may have been Jules Gabriel √âmile de Seigneux, a minor French nobleman and officer in the Prussian army. Eduard was ennobled by his mother's younger brother, Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and assumed the surname von L√∂wenfels by decree on 18 February 1818. Later, Anna moved to Bern, Switzerland, and gave birth to a second illegitimate child in 1812, a daughter, named Louise Hilda Agnes d'Aubert. The father was Rodolphe Abraham de Schiferli, a Swiss surgeon, professor and chamberlain of Anna's household from 1812 to 1837. In order to cover another scandal in Anna's life, the baby was adopted by Jean Fran√ßois Joseph d'Aubert, a French refugee. After the affair ended, Schiferli maintained a tender and close friendship with the grand duchess until his death.Ivan Grezin: Grand Duchess Anna Fyodorovna: in search of simple happiness in the middle of the big policy On-line translation to English (retrieved 10 September 2012 Two years later, in 1814, during the invasion of France by Russian troops, Emperor Alexander I expressed his desire of a reconciliation between his brother and Anna. Grand Duke Konstantin, accompanied by Anna's brother Leopold, tried to convince her to return with him, but the grand duchess categorically refused. That year, Anna acquired an estate on the banks of Aare River and gave it the name of Elfenau.Karl Viktor von Bonstetten, Doris Walser-Wilhelm, Antje Kolde: Bonstettiana, Band 10; Band 1805-1811, Wallstein Verlag, 2003, p. 629. She spent the rest of her life there, and, as a lover of music, made her home not only a center for domestic and foreign musical society of the era but also the point of reunion of diplomats from different countries who were in Bern. Finally, on 20 March 1820, after 19 years of separation, her marriage was officially annulled by a manifesto of Emperor Alexander I of Russia. Grand Duke Konstantin remarried two months later morganatically with his mistress Joanna Grudzi≈Ñska and died on 27 June 1831. Anna survived her former husband by 29 years. In 1835, her son Eduard married his cousin Bertha von Schauenstein, an illegitimate daughter of the Duke Ernest I; this was one of the few happy events in Anna's last years - she soon lost almost all the people she loved: her parents, her sisters Sophie and Antoinette, her own daughter Louise (who, married Jean Samuel Edouard Dapples in 1834 died three years later in 1837 at the age of twenty-five), her former lover and now good friend Rodolphe de Schiferli (just a few weeks after their daughter's demise), her protector Emperor Alexander I, her childhood friend Empress Elizabeth...at that point the Grand Duchess wrote that Elfenau became the House of Mourning. Anna Fyodorovna died in her Elfenau estate in 1860, aged 79. In her grave was placed a simple marble slab with the inscription, \\"Julia-Anna\\" and the dates of her birth and death (1781-1860); nothing more would indicate the origin of the once Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Grand Duchess of Russia. Through the five children of her son Eduard she has many descendants.Complete Genealogy of the House of Wettin Alexandrine of Baden, wife of her nephew Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha wrote: :Condolences must be universal, because Aunt was extremely loved and respected, because much involved in charity work and in favor of the poor and underprivileged.

He played as a defender.With 3 non league England caps Playing career =Birmingham City= Smith started his career in 1994 with his local side Birmingham City With a two year deal =Willenhall Town= Smith failed, however, to make the first team with Birmingham City, and after being released he moved on to join Midland Football Alliance side Willenhall Town in 1995, whilst working on a part-time basis as a roofer. Smith spent one season with Willenhall Town, in which he turned in some very impressive performances, which alerted interest from other clubs. =Bromsgrove Rovers= Smith began to rise up the leagues and he joined Football Conference side Bromsgrove Rovers on 1 August 1996, with Rovers manager Bobby Hope paying a fee of ¬£1,500 for his services. Smith spent one season with Bromsgrove Rovers, but the season ended in disappointment when the club was relegated. =Kidderminster Harriers= Smith's performances with Bromsgrove Rovers did not go unnoticed and captured the interest of local rivals Kidderminster Harriers, whom he joined on 1 August 1997 for ¬£19,000. The move gave Smith another crack at Conference football. Smith became a fans' favourite at Kidderminster and, after just two seasons in the Conference, Smith and Harriers won the Conference title in the 1999‚Äì2000 season, and they were promoted to the Third Division. He stayed with Kidderminster for another three seasons in the Third Division, but on 6 February 2004, it was confirmed that a disappointed Kidderminster manager Jan M√∏lby had agreed to Smith's request for his contract to be terminated for personal reasons. Smith had become a great servant to Kidderminster Harriers, playing 243 games and scored 13 goals. He explained that his sudden decision to quit Kidderminster had been based on his wanting to turn semi-professional as he believed he could no longer play at a professional level. =Tamworth= Three days later, Tamworth manager Darron Gee announced the signing of Smith on an 18-month contract. Smith completed the remainder of the season with Tamworth, with the club finishing in 17th position and avoiding relegation. Smith's second season with Tamworth was without doubt the best for a league perspective, the club were yet again seen as potential relegation battlers, but defied the odds to finish 15th and make history with the Lambs gaining their highest league position in their history, although by the end of this season, Smith's contract had run out. On 14 April 2005, Smith showed his loyalty to the club by signing a new contract. By this point, he had become the club's captain and led them to a place in the FA Cup Third Round. The club drew Stoke City and managed to take them to a replay at the Lamb, before going out on penalties. Although Smith and Tamworth had a very successful Cup run, the club failed to emulate the same form in the league and were relegated after finishing 21st. The club were reinstated when Canvey Island withdrew from the league due to financial problems. Smith and Tamworth started the 2006‚Äì07 season and finished it pretty much the same as they did the previous season. He and goalkeeping coach Dale Belford took charge of the first-team following the departure of manager Mark Cooper and assistant manager Richard Dryden in January 2007. The club repeated the success they had enjoyed in the previous season by reaching the third round of the FA Cup, but another disappointing league campaign saw Tamworth finish 22nd and be relegated from the Conference. Despite their relegation, Smith signed a new one-year contract with the Staffordshire club on 4 May 2007. Smith explained that his decision was an easy one, due to his love for the club, fans and people at the club. =Chasetown= After four years with The Lambs, Smith finally moved on to Southern League Division One Midlands side Chasetown for the 2008/09 season. =Rushall Olympic= On 14 November 2009, Smith joined Rushall Olympic. Smith again became a very popular figure at the club, quickly establishing himself as first team captain. In the conclusion to the 2010‚Äì11 season with Rushall seeking promotion Smith was injured in an away game at Romulus in the closing weeks of the season. It seemed his season was over as his cheekbone was broken. However, he returned to lead the team out for the play-off final wearing a protective face mask sourced from Warwickshire County Cricket Club. Rushall won the play-off final and were promoted to Step 3 of English Non- League Football for the first time in their history. Smith started the 2011‚Äì12 campaign in good form but he suffered a serious achilles tendon injury in an away fixture at Hednesford Town and was ruled out for the season. Stafford Town Adie was appointed Assistant Manager to Adam Cunningham during the 2013/14 campaign, he also played for them when they were short of players, Adie left his position as assistant at the start of the 2015-16 campaign.

The risk arises from the observation that more concentrated portfolios are less diverse and therefore the returns on the underlying assets are more correlated. Concentration risk can be calculated for a single bank loan or whole portfolio using a \\"concentration ratio\\". For a single loan, the concentration ratio is simply the proportion of the portfolio the loan represents (e.g. a $100 loan in a $1000 portfolio would have a ratio of 0.1 or 10%) For a whole portfolio, a herfindahl index is used to calculate the degree of concentration to a single name, sector of the economy or country. Separate concentration ratios must be calculated for each type of concentration. To illustrate, a portfolio with 10 equally sized loans would have a concentration ratio of 0.1 or 10%, whereas a portfolio of 10 loans - 9 equally sized and 1 equal to half the value of the portfolio would have a concentration ratio of 0.27 or 27%. The ratio is useful for bankers or investors at large to identify when a portfolio may be excessively exposed to the risk that a recession or downturn in one sector of the economy or another country may cause a high proportion of the bank's outstanding loans to default. Concentration risk is usually monitored by risk functions, committees and boards within commercial banks and is normally only allowed to operate within proscribed limits. It is also monitored by banking regulators and generally attracts a higher capital charge in banking regulation. Types There are two types of concentration risk. These types are based on the sources of the risk. Concentration risk can arise from uneven distribution of exposures (or loan) to its borrowers. Such a risk is called name concentration risk. Another type is sectoral concentration risk, which can arise from uneven distribution of exposures to particular sectors, regions, industries or products. Monitoring and management Most financial institutions have policies to identify and limit concentration risk. This typically involves setting certain thresholds for various types of risk. Once these thresholds are set, they are managed by frequent and diligent reporting to assess concentration areas and identify elevated thresholds. A key component to the management of concentration risk is accurately defining thresholds across various concentrations to minimize the combined risks across concentrations.

Plot summary Beginning on a cold October night in 1854 in a dark passageway, the book's narrator tracks an innocent man whom he does not know and stabs him to death. The protagonist/narrator, Edward Glyver, then takes the reader back, recounting as a confession his tale of deceit, love, and revenge. Glyver reveals the torment he has suffered at the hands of his rival, the poet-criminal Phoebus Rainsford Daunt, and why in pursuit of revenge Glyver (now masquerading as Edward Glapthorn), a book lover and scholar, has turned to murder. The story moves between the foggy London streets and the enchanting country manor house Evenwood where Daunt spent his formative years, a place with which Glyver finds he has a special connection. The Glass of Time, the follow-up novel to The Meaning of Night, further examines the consequences of Edward Glyver's crime, in a setting twenty years after The Meaning of Night.

S. Lee, was a Chinese geologist and politician. He was the founder of China's geomechanics. He was an ethnic Mongol. He made outstanding contributions, which changed the situation of \\"oil deficiency\\" in the country, enabling the large-scale development of oil fields to raise the country to the ranks of the world's major oil producers. Biography Li was born as Li Zhongkui () in Huanggang, Hubei Province. His paternal grandfather was a Mongolian beggar who migrated to Hubei in search of a better livelihood, and his family originally had the Mongol surname \\"Kuli\\" () or \\"Ku\\" (). He was often known in English as J. S. Lee (J for Zhongkui/Jung-kuei, S for Siguang). Li studied in Osaka Technical College in Japan and the University of Birmingham in UK in his early years. He became a geological professor at Peking University upon his return from abroad in 1920. Li Siguang was Wuhan University building preparatory chairman from July 1928 to April 1938. He was the president of National Central University (Nanjing University) in 1932. After the People's Republic of China was established, Li held the positions of vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and minister of geology. After the end of the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì1976), Xu Chi published Li's biography entitled The Light of Geology (), which was widely read and made Li a household name in China.  Family  Li Lin and son-in-law Chen-Lu Tsou Li Siguang's daughter Li Lin was a physicist and academician of the CAS. She married Chen-Lu Tsou (Zou Chenglu), a distinguished biochemist and academician, while they were both attending the University of Cambridge in England. Li's family is thus the only one in China that has produced three academicians. Li Lin's daughter, Zou Zongping () followed her grandfather's footsteps and became a geologist.

After watching the Sandusky Blue Streaks play, Farber adopted the name to his own team, knowing that they would likely never play each other because of the difference in school size. Prior to this, Archbold had been referred to as \\"the Archbold Team.\\" In the 1910s, some local fathers started a movement to call the squad the \\"Archbold Germans\\" due to the German heritage of most of the players. However, this name never stuck on.

It has assets of approximately $950 million and distributes about $45 million in grants each year. The Foundation primarily funds organizations in the Great Lakes region. The Foundation is notable for its support of gun control measures. U.S. President Barack Obama served on the foundation's board of directors from 1994 through 2002. History The Joyce Foundation was established in 1948 by Beatrice Joyce Kean of Chicago. She was the sole heir of David Joyce, a lumber executive and industrialist from Clinton, Iowa. The family wealth came from the lumber industry, including family-owned timberlands, plywood and saw mills, and wholesale and retail building material distribution facilities located in the Midwest, Louisiana, and Texas. The Foundation was modestly endowed until Kean's death in 1972, when she bequeathed it nearly $100 million. Charles U. Daly, a former aide to President John F. Kennedy, served as president of the Foundation for eight years. He was succeeded by Craig Kennedy in 1986. Deborah Leff, a trial lawyer for the civil rights division of the Department of Justice, served as president of the organization from 1992 to 1999, and was succeeded by Paula DiPerna, named president in 1999. DiPerna was succeeded in 2002 by Ellen Alberding, the organization's seventh president. Former U.S. President Barack Obama served on the foundation's board of directors from 1994 through 2002. As of 2015, the Joyce Foundation has awarded over $950 million in grants since its establishment. Mission The Foundation describes its mission as \\"working to improve quality of life, promote community vitality, and achieve a fair society.\\" Programs The Joyce Foundation's primary focus is on the Great Lakes region, where its funding efforts are focused on \\"environmental preservation, diverse art, energy efficiency, teacher quality, gun violence prevention, early literacy, and workforce development.\\" Foundation programs invest in public education, economic opportunity, and the environment. Other programs promote voting rights and arts organizations. The Joyce Foundation is one of the few private foundations that considers gun-related research proposals. Joyce distributes grants designed to prevent gun violence by reducing the easy accessibility of firearms. Since 1993, the Joyce Foundation spent over $54 million on over 100 grants that favor gun control.

John Adams (July 1, 1825 ‚Äì November 30, 1864) was an officer in the United States Army. With the onset of the American Civil War, he resigned his commission and joined the Confederate States Army, rising to the rank of brigadier general before being killed in action. Early life and career Adams was born in Nashville, Tennessee, to Irish immigrant parents. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1846, ranking 25th in his class. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 1st Dragoons, serving under Capt. Philip Kearny. Adams was brevetted for gallantry during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Rosales. After the war, Adams served on the western frontier, primarily in California. He was subsequently promoted to first lieutenant and captain. As a lieutenant colonel in the state militia, he was aide-de-camp to the Governor of Minnesota in 1853. Adams had 4 sons and 2 daughters. Civil War Career With the secession of Tennessee, Adams resigned his commission in the United States Army in early 1861 and joined the Confederate Army not long afterward as a captain in the cavalry. He was commissioned a colonel in 1862, and a brigadier general in December of that same year, replacing the late Lloyd Tilghman in charge of his brigade of infantry. Adams served entirely in the Western Theater and was commended in several official reports for his leadership. He was particularly conspicuous during the Atlanta Campaign, where he again displayed personal bravery as well as a talent for battlefield tactics. His brigade was selected to lead the advance of John Bell Hood's army into Tennessee. Adams was killed at the Second Battle of Franklin in 1864, one of six Confederate generals to perish in the defeat. An Indiana colonel who witnessed his death later wrote: > General Adams rode up to our works and, cheering his men, made an attempt to > leap his horse over them. The horse fell upon the top of the embankment and > the general was caught under him, pierced with [nine] bullets. As soon as > the charge was repulsed, our men sprang over the works and lifted the horse, > while others dragged the general from under him. He was perfectly conscious > and knew his fate. He asked for water, as all dying men do in battle as the > life-blood drips from the body. One of my men gave him a canteen of water, > while another brought an armful of cotton from an old gin near by and made > him a pillow.

A derivative of the Europa XS kit plane, it serves both as a touring aircraft for private flyers and as a flight trainer. Subsequently, Discovery Aviation acquired the rights and in 2018 production of the aircraft (now named as the Discovery XL-2) resumed at the same Florida factory. Design and development Derived from the Europa XS kitplane and motor-glider, the XL-2 was type certified in 2004 under FAR Part 23 for VFR and IFR flight. Compared to the Europa XS, the fuselage is slightly wider and larger to accommodate bigger American pilots, and also taller with a bigger windscreen. The wing is metal instead of composite and the aircraft is equipped with a Teledyne Continental Motors FADEC-controlled engine mounted on a metal space frame instead of the Europa's Rotax 912 engine mounted on the fiberglass fuselage. The landing gear is also of a different design. The Liberty was designed by Ivan Shaw, who also created the Europa. The aircraft has a composite fuselage and aluminum wings. The engine is a fuel injected FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) equipped Continental IOF-240‚ÄìB driving an MT composite propeller.Hunt, Adam: Flying the Liberty XL2, COPA Flight, January 2006, Canadian Owners and Pilots Association The landing gear is of tricycle configuration and all three sprung gear legs are made from 4130 chrome-molybdenum steel alloy. The nose wheel is free-castering. On early versions the nose wheel steering was by differential braking via two finger- controlled brake handles mounted on the centre console. On later versions more conventional toe brakes were installed. The wing features large fowler flaps pivoting on three scissor hinges per wing, with a maximum 30-degree deflection. The flaps are electrically powered and are controlled by a switch to the right of the radio stack. The flap indicator is a three-light system which shows when the flaps are at zero, twenty and thirty degrees. The flaps can be selected in between those settings but require visual confirmation of flap position. The wing is rectangular with a 7:1 aspect ratio, no taper and no washout. Small stall strips are installed a few feet out from the root to aid stall performance. The airfoil is a unique design, which the XL2 shares with its predecessor the Europa. This is a Don Dykins airfoil, designated as a \\"Dykins 12%\\", because the wing's maximum thickness is 12% of the chord. The airfoil is a semi-symmetrical, laminar-flow design. The stall warning system is a voice annunciator that says \\"stall, stall\\". The fuel is housed in a single fuselage-mounted tank with filler on the left side. The tank holds 28 US gallons usable and is fed to the engine via a simple on-off fuel selector. The tail features a rudder mounted with a piano hinge on the right side only. The elevator is a full flying stabilator and incorporates anti-servo tabs inboard on both sides to increase pitch stick forces. The controls are actuated by dual control sticks and conventional rudder pedals. Cockpit access is via two \\"gull wing\\" doors. The seats are mounted in side-by-side configuration in a cockpit. The seats are fixed in place with ergonomic adjustment achieved with seat cushions of different thicknesses and adjustable rudder pedals. Standard avionics include a Garmin 530 GPS-Comm, a 430 GPS-Comm and a GTX 327 transponder, along with an intercom system and audio control panel. Engine instruments are all contained within a Vision MicroSystems VM-1000 panel. Under the right side of the instrument panel is an ITT Cannon D-subminiature plug providing RS-232 serial communication, into which a computer can be plugged to download engine monitoring information. The software to run this is included on a CD-ROM that comes with the plane. This has been upgraded to an EDI card (engine Data Information). This card is a memory card much like in a digital camera, and records all engine data from 0 hours, until the 2000 hour TBO and can be read with a card reader to diagnose problems and observe flight characteristics in real time. In July 2009 the company introduced a version of the XL2 equipped with a Wilksch Airmotive turbocharged diesel power plant that burns Jet-A fuel aimed at the non-North American market. Liberty was to assist Wilksch in certifying this engine. In April 2011 the company announced that they had developed a Rotax 912S powered version that runs on auto fuel aimed at Asian markets, due to lack of 100 octane avgas fuel outside North America. The engine will be available as a factory option and also as a retrofit under a supplemental type certificate and saves in empty weight, due to the much lighter engine. With the start of the 2008 global recession, sales of the XL2 slowed greatly. During 2011 the company shipped only two aircraft and none during the first two quarters of 2012. In late September 2012 the sale of 50 XL2s to the city of Wuhan, China was announced. In October 2012 the Chinese order was increased to 200 aircraft, with components being shipped to Wuhan for final assembly. Discovery Aviation purchased the rights to the design in 2014, putting it back into limited production with avionics upgrades in January 2018 under the name Discovery XL-2. The company reported orders for three aircraft for a South Korean operator at that time. Discovery planned to increase production to full capacity by the end of 2018.

The highway runs north‚Äìsouth from the South Carolina state line, near Cashiers, to US 23 Business in Sylva. Route description US 64 at NC 107, in Cashiers The highway is four lanes between Sylva and Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, and two lanes beyond. Between WCU and Cashiers (about ), the highway is a winding mountain road, and continues in this manner all the way to the South Carolina state border. Before it was straightened and bypassed around Cullowhee in 1978-1981, the road followed the Tuckasegee River through Cullowhee, and went along the opposite edge of Western Carolina University. This is now known as Old Cullowhee Road and is planned to become the new downtown area for Cullowhee. The area of NC 107 around Sylva is lined with businesses. History Established in the early 1920s as an original highway, it was a spur of NC 10 (now Old Highway 19A) from Ela, through Cherokee, to the Tennessee state line at Newfound Gap. In 1940, the highway was rerouted south of Cherokee, replacing NC 107E; it then went concurrently with US 19 (now US 74/US 441) and Haywood Road (SR 1514) to Dillsboro and Sylva (now US 23 Bus). From Sylva, it replaced all of NC 106 south, through Cullowhee and Cashiers, to the South Carolina state line. The old route between Ela to Cherokee became part of NC 28 (now US 19). In 1952, was truncated to its current northern terminus in Sylva; its route between Dillsboro to Tennessee was replaced by US 441\\\\. The final major change happened in 1981, when NC 107 was rerouted onto a new four-lane bypass west of Cullowhee; the old route became Old Cullowhee Road (SR 1002). In 1994, the \\"Southern Loop\\" was added to the Jackson County thoroughfare plan that was to connect NC 107 with US 23/US 441 south of Dillsboro to US 23/US 74 east of Sylva; in 2003, it was added to the North Carolina Department of Transportation's (NCDOT) State Transportation Improvement Program as R-4745. In 2008, the western half of the project was removed, leaving the eastern half; the project was renamed the NC 107 Connector. Environmental impact studies were completed by end of 2012; however right of way acquisition was scheduled for 2021 and with construction unfunded (estimated cost at $132 million) and scheduled after 2023. On June 27, 2013, NCDOT issued a news release stating that after local input regarding the NC 107 connector, it was decided that they would instead focus on improving the existing NC 107 corridor between NC 106 and US 23 Business. Once improvements along this section is complete, NCDOT will decide whether there is a need for further study of the NC 107 Connector. =North Carolina Highway 107E= North Carolina Highway 107E (NC 107E) was established around 1938 as a renumbering of NC 112, from US 19 (now US 74/US 441) near Whittier, to NC 107 (now US 19/US 441 Bus.) in Cherokee. In 1940, it was replaced by realignment of NC 107 (now US 441/US 441 Bus.). Future NCDOT plans to modernize two sections of NC 107\\\\. The first section of NC 107 is between the climbing lane to NC 281\\\\. The project includes widening lanes to from the current width and paving shoulders. At an estimated cost of $17.1 million, it is currently unfunded. The second section of NC 107 is between NC 281 and SR 1002 (Old Cullowhee Road). The project includes widening lanes to from the current and improve shoulders. At an estimated cost of $18.6 million, it is also currently unfunded. Currently as a future study, the NC 107 Connector would be a new four-lane freeway, connecting between NC 107 and US 23/US 74, east of Sylva. At an estimated cost of $66 million, it is currently unfunded.

Towns and villages served along the way are Malton, Norton-on- Derwent and Seamer.  History  The line was built by George Hudson's York and North Midland Railway and opened on 7 July 1845. The line was constructed remarkably quickly by the standards of the time, taking just one year and three days to complete the 42-mile route. This feat was possible because the Y&NMR; decided against the more costly and time-consuming option of building a tunnel through the Howardian Hills south of Malton. Instead the chosen route meanders with the River Derwent for around four miles, creating a slower but more scenically pleasant experience for passengers. The railway line was opened with a ceremony for invited guests who were taken by George Hudson on a train of two engines and 40 first class coaches, which left York at 11.00 am. The line was initially single track and the journey to Scarborough took three and a half hours. In Scarborough the guests were treated to a lunch. After a return journey to York, the guests were treated to dinner in the Guildhall, hosted by the Lord Mayor of York. The new railway included a 6-mile branch from Rillington to Pickering that connected with the horse-worked Whitby and Pickering Railway which the Y&NMR; immediately proceeded to take over and upgrade for steam traction. Most of the intermediate stations on the line were closed to passengers in September 1930 as the number of excursion and holiday trains going straight through to Scarborough during that period meant that the line lacked the capacity to accommodate stopping local services. These services were already seeing a significant decline in passenger numbers prior to their withdrawal due to increased bus competition in the area. The closed stations retained their goods facilities and were maintained for occasional passenger use by excursion trains until the 1960s. York-Scarborough Railway = Modern = There are currently plans to re-open the stations at Haxby and Strensall due to the growth of population in those areas. There have been suggestions to re-open these stations since 1990 when it was pointed out that if they were inside a metropolitan county, then they would be re-opened very quickly. In January 2009 funding to re-open Haxby station was confirmed but the Strensall plan has yet to come to fruition. In 2014, work started on replacing the 1840s built bridge that carries the railway over the River Ouse. Network Rail spent ¬£6 million on the entire project and used boats and pontoons floated on the River Ouse to reach the bridge. The new bridge opened to traffic on 23 February 2015. The route has 89 level crossings between York and Scarborough; 12 are supervised, 10 automatic and 67 are user worked crossings. All supervised and automatic crossings and the residual seven signal boxes en route will be closed and control handed over to the York Rail Operating Centre by 2025.  Services  Services operated along this line are run by TransPennine Express. Services are roughly hourly and operate to and from either York, Manchester or Liverpool with a reduced service on Sundays. This is part of the North TransPennine route. Rolling stock on this line has consisted almost entirely of Class 185 DMUs since early 2007. East Midlands Railway also run occasional summer services. The new Northern franchise run by Arriva Rail North had intended to start running services over the line in December 2019, with an additional 14 trains per day from Monday to Saturday (13 trains per day on Sunday) in addition to the current TransPennine Express service.Northern Franchise Improvements ‚Äì DfTDepartment for Transport; Retrieved 13 June 2016 The service has been delayed into 2020, with no definitive start date. In February 2020, driver training started on the line using Pacer Class 142 trains, with a view to the service starting in May 2020. Scarborough also sees steam-hauled summer specials from York, hauled by various preserved steam locomotives. There is also talk of reinstating the pre-1965 link to Pickering to connect the North Yorkshire Moors Railway to the national network from its southern end, allowing trains from Malton and beyond to reach Whitby. Such a move has been considered but does not seem likely for the foreseeable future.  Incidents  On 25 August 1845 the 12.15 train from York came off the rails a quarter of a mile south of Kirkham Abbey, in the vicinity of Crambe, due to subsidence of an embankment beside the River Derwent. Thomas Cabry was on the engine and hurt his foot in the process. (Brian Lewis 1994: The Cabry Family, p.31). 185133 is approaching York station on the old railway bridge over the River Ouse. The service is for Liverpool Lime Street. On 3 February 2009, a car hit the back of a train passing over Knapton level crossing. The driver was taken to hospital, but he was not kept in. There were no casualties on the train. The level crossing is an AHBC ‚Äì automatic half barrier crossing.

They were aimed at a new breed of car-driving metropolitan tourist, and for those who sought guides that were neither too serious nor too shallow and who took pleasure in the ordinary and peculiar culture of small town Britain. In the three decades after the Second World War the Shell Guides provided a surreptitiously subversive synthesis of the British countryside.Guardian article on Shell Guides exhibition History The series started in June 1934, with Betjeman's Cornwall, and continued until 1984, by which time about half the country had been covered. The series was sponsored by the oil company Shell. The original guides were published on a county-by-county basis, under the editorial control of the poet John Betjeman and (later) the artist John Piper. There were three publishers involved in the publication of the 13 pre-war titles: The Architectural Press, Batsford and finally, in 1939, Faber and Faber. In 1939 all the previous twelve titles were re-issued and one new one in the same format: David Verey's Gloucestershire. The next one planned was Shropshire to be co-written by Betjeman and Piper. However, the Second World War intervened. Only one non-English area was covered: The West Coast of Scotland by Stephen Bone, arguably the most political of all the Shell Guides. Post-war however every bit of Wales was covered in five different titles. It was not until 1951 that the next Shell Guide was produced. Jack Beddington's involvement in the Shell Guides and Shell advertising in general cannot be underestimated and it is because of him, that from the outset, artists were invited to produce Shell Guides; John and Paul Nash for instance and of course John Piper. The cover of the 1964 Shilling Guide to Derbyshire and Staffordshire was drawn by Julian Trevelyan During the early 1960s a series of 48 cheaper Shilling Guides appeared, much to Betjeman's annoyance, especially as they sold in greater numbers. Published by the Shell-Mex and BP joint venture, each had just 20 pages with a full colour card cover, representing highlights of the county covered, and included a two colour map of the area, preceded by an essay on the history and landscape, and followed by a short gazetteer of main towns and tourist attractions. The original artwork for this series was sold by Shell in 2002 at an auction held by Sotheby's. These images by such artists as Keith Shackleton and David Gentleman also featured in the (now collectable ) Shell Posters that were published for use in schools. These appeared between 1959 and 1965. From the late 1950s to the early 1970s, a series of general titles under the Shell Guide banner were produced, covering most of the countries in northwest Europe. Guides to subjects such as rivers, islands, viewpoints, archaeology, gardens, flowers, history, wildlife and museums were also published. In 1987, Shell issued a final series of New Shell Guides, published by Michael Joseph and generally covering rather larger areas (e.g. Northern Scotland and the Islands) than in the earlier series. Whilst the original Shell County Guides are now highly collectable, the later titles (published by Faber & Faber, Ebury Press or Michael Joseph) tend to be shunned by collectors and book dealers alike, as supply exceeds demand.  Selected books  * Of the original pre-war guides, Paul Nash's Dorset (1936) has been described as the most artistically experimental of the series. * The more collectable post-war guides include Betjeman and Piper's Shropshire (1951), David Verey's Mid-Wales (1960), W.G.

Europe 1954‚Äì1963 Sandler began performing as a boy with the Belgian choir ¬´ les petits chanteurs des sept croix ¬ª of Mouscron. In 1954, he recorded his first hit \\"Song of the Sea\\" while serving with the Belgian Air Force during the Korean War. He attracted international audiences in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Britain, and became a stage and television star with dozens of hit records. He also starred in four German/Italian films as well as musical productions. Sandler then starred and headlined with singing engagements at the 'Roof Garden' of the renowned Caf√© Roma in Alassio on the Italian Riviera leading him to his U.S. debut. On 29 November 1963 Sandler joined the cast of the \\"Casino de Paris\\" revue at the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas. In this extravaganza Tony Sandler performed side by side with French star Line Renaud and also one American entertainer Ralph Young. Sandler & Young (1963‚Äì1987)  Tony Sandler and Ralph Young stayed for two seasons committed to the Casino de Paris show. In 1965 Tony Sandler and Ralph Young decided to cease work as soloists and perform together as a singing team and that was the beginning of the very successful story of Sandler and Young. The hit duo Sandler & Young performed for two decades as headliners in the main showrooms of the major Las Vegas hotels and casinos and all over the country. They secured guest spots on many national TV shows and sold millions of records, making them one of the most popular acts in show business. In the mid-eighties, Ralph Young wanted to retire from the act to spend more time with his family in Palm Springs and Los Angeles. Tony Sandler, two decades younger, continued to perform and produce. Sandler is still active, singing American and European repertory. On special occasions, Sandler and Young reteamed to perform to sellout crowds. Their last appearance together was at the 2003 All Stars benefit show Let Freedom Ring in Palm Springs to honor the victims of 9/11. Ralph Young died at his Palm Springs home on 22 August 2008 at the age of 90. Several Sandler and Young albums have recently been re-released by the Butterfly label. Solo work In 1985, for the TV network PBS he hosted the programs Portrait of Europe: Flanders and For the Night of Christmas from Bruges. In the nineties he toured solo with his one-man show, Chevalier, Maurice & Me, and with the symphony‚Äìpop production My Paris, arranged by Peter Matz.

Its members are the largest of the subfamily. All species are darkly colored, nocturnal, and flightless. Males usually have exaggerated mandibles compared to the females, used for clasping during copulation. Taxonomy This genus was among the first formally described by a pupil of Carl Linnaeus, Johan Christian Fabricius, in 1792. The name Manticora comes from the ancient Persian for the legendary man-eating manticore. The first species of Manticora described was M. tuberculata, originally described by Charles De Geer in 1778 in the Linnean genus Carabus, to which it is only distantly related as presently defined. When Fabricius established Manticora he designated the species Carabus maxillosa, a junior synonym of M. tuberculata, as the type species. Subsequently, numerous authors have described a number of additional species, subspecies, and variants, and the exact delimitation of taxa is highly disputed, with experts claiming as few as five species and as many as 13, though it seems the latter number is highly artificial, and not based upon objective criteria or DNA analyses.South African National Biodiversity Institute: assessment of Manticora conservation status  Species  Manticora contains the following species (under the most ambitious scheme; alternative classifications only recognize as few as 5 taxa): * Manticora congoensis Peringuey, 1888 * Manticora gruti Bouchard, 1892 * Manticora holubi Mare≈°, 2002 * Manticora imperator Mare≈°, 1976 * Manticora latipennis Waterhouse, 1837 * Manticora livingstoni Laporte de Castelnau, 1863 * Manticora mygaloides Thomson, 1859 * Manticora scabra Klug, 1849 * Manticora sicheli Thomson, 1859 * Manticora skrabali Mare≈°, 2000 * Manticora tibialis Boheman, 1848 * Manticora tuberculata Geer, 1778 * Manticora tyrannus Mare≈°, 2019 * Manticora werneri Mare≈°, 2000  Manticoras in folklore and popular culture  Museum specimen of Manticora sp. from Mozambique. Manticora tuberculata In African folklore manticoras are evil creatures, often accused of being responsible for many bad things. According to legend they are doombringers. Some tribes even personify Death as a manticora whose mandibles are an equivalent to the European scythe of death (Mare≈°, Lap√°ƒçek, 1980). In Jules Verne's novel Dick Sand, A Captain at Fifteen, it is a Manticora beetle which helps Cousin B√©n√©dict to escape from imprisonment, when the aforementioned, unguarded in a garden, follows the beetle. Since the beetle escapes from him by flying, it is possible that it is one of Verne's \\"scholar's jokes\\" (that is, a joke which only a scientist may recognize; see the entry Jules Verne) (Neff, 1978).

The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is the agency responsible for the day-to-day maintenance and operations of the Interstate Highways in Texas. The Interstate Highway System in Texas covers and consists of twelve primary routes, seven auxiliary routes and Interstate 35 (I-35) which is split into two branches, I-35E and I-35W, that provide access to both Fort Worth and Dallas. The longest segment of Interstate Highway in Texas is I-10 at ; the shortest is I-110 at . The construction of the Interstate Highway System in Texas began well before these routes were designated as Interstate Highways. A stretch of I-45 between Galveston and Houston was opened in 1951, eight years before it was designated I-45. It was also the first urban expressway in Texas. In 1962, of I-35 opened in Bexar County, the first section of Interstate Highway to open from county line to county line in a large metropolitan area. Portions of I-10 west of San Antonio took much longer to complete due to the vast open spaces and lack of nearby labor. The majority of the construction of this section of I-10 occurred in the 1970s and 1980s and was complete by the early 1990s. The section east of San Antonio was completed 20 years earlier in 1972. The opening of a section of I-27 in 1992 completed the Interstate Highway System in Texas. Planning is ongoing for a proposed extension of I-69 southward from its original terminus in Indiana through Texas to the United States‚ÄìMexico border. If complete as planned, I-69 will extend about across Texas, from the Louisiana state line in the Texarkana‚ÄìShreveport area to South Texas. The first portion was approved in 2011, with signage posted December 6, 2011.

It is situated between the Bruch's membrane, choriocapillaris and Haller's layer below, and the suprachoroidea above, respectively. The origin seems to be related to a continuous differentiation throughout the growth of the tissue and even further differentiation during adulthood.  Measurement methods and clinical impact  After excision the choroid collapses partially, histologic preparations also alter the local pressure and fluid content of different sections in the tissue, thus requiring preparations with rubber solution or others that can conserve the vascular status of living tissue. Novel diagnostic methods, especially optical coherence tomography have widened the understanding of the real time, in vivo status of the different layers. Several papers have shown the relationship between the thickness of the choroidal, Sattler's and Haller's layer between healthy individuals and in people with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The studies showed significant reduction of layer thickness in relation to the progression of AMD, which may be important in the understanding of choriopathy in the pathophysiology of AMD. However, also strong variations even throughout the diurnal cycle, as well as the influence of optical stimuli during eye- growth indicate that the complex function of this tissue is not entirely understood and might be one of the reasons for the frequently found separation in vascular size between Haller's and Sattler's layer.

Reed, a Fort Wayne druggist, as colonel, and officially mustered in on November 22, 1861. It was composed mostly of volunteers from what was then Indiana's Tenth Congressional District in the northeastern part of the state. In December, the regiment left for Henderson, Kentucky. It camped at Calhoun, Kentucky, until February 1862, when it moved to Fort Henry, Tennessee, then to Fort Donelson, Tennessee, where it participated in the siege of the fort, taking heavy casualties there. The regiment was engaged both days, April 6‚Äì7, 1862, at the Battle of Shiloh, where it suffered 33 killed and 177 wounded. It participated in the Siege of Corinth, Mississippi, and fought at Stones River, Chickamauga and Missionary Ridge. It was assigned provost (police) duty at Chattanooga, Tennessee, before being mustered out on September 14, 1865. Frederick Dyer (see references) reports that the regiment's total combat fatalities were four officers and 76 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded, and nine officers and 220 enlisted men who died of disease. The Indiana Chickamauga Commission (see references), however, reports the 44th's casualties as 350 killed and wounded in combat, and another 58 dead from disease.

Rescue opera was a genre of opera in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in France and Germany. Generally, rescue operas deal with the rescue of a main character from danger and end with a happy dramatic resolution in which lofty humanistic ideals triumph over base motives. Operas with this kind of subject matter became popular in France around the time of the French Revolution; a number of such operas dealt with the rescue of a political prisoner. Stylistically and thematically, rescue opera was an outgrowth of the French bourgeois op√©ra comique; musically, it began a new tradition that would influence German Romantic opera and French grand opera. The most famous rescue opera is Ludwig van Beethoven's Fidelio. Term \\"Rescue opera\\" was not a contemporary term. 'Rescue opera' ... was coined only in the late 19th or early 20th century.\\" Charlton, David (1992), 'Rescue opera' in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera Dyneley Hussey used the term in English in 1927 as a translation of Karl M. Klob's 1913 reference to Fidelio as \\"das sogenannte Rettungs- oder Befreiungsst√ºck\\" in Die Oper von Gluck bis Wagner. David Charlton believes that rescue opera is not an authentic genre, and that the concept was coined to make what he believes is a nonexistent connection between Beethoven's work and French opera.\\". . .the idea of 'rescue opera' has provided a superficial means of relating Fidelio to French tradition. The attempt was founded on little knowledge, and the dangerous consequence of using the term is to distort historical values.\\" Charlton, David (1992), 'Rescue opera' in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera Patrick J. Smith, on the other hand, observes: \\"The 'rescue opera'...antedated the Revolution, but 'rescue opera' as a genre was a product of it.\\" In French, this genre is referred to as the pi√®ce √† sauvetage or op√©ra √† sauvetage, while in German it is called Rettungsoper, Befreiungsoper (liberation opera), or Schreckensoper (terror opera). Examples :See: :Category:Rescue operas Early op√©ras comiques with rescue themes include Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny's Le roi et le fermier (1762) and Le d√©serteur (1769), and Andr√© Gr√©try's Richard Coeur-de-lion (1784). These are sometimes called early rescue operas, or conversely predecessors of the rescue opera. Henri Montan Berton's Les rigueurs du clo√Ætre (1790) has been described as the first rescue opera;The Music Review, 1981 Luigi Cherubini's Lodo√Øska (1791) has also been named a founding work of the genre. Other examples from the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century, the period when rescue opera flourished, are Nicolas Dalayrac's Camille ou Le souterrain (1791), Jean-Fran√ßois Le Sueur's La caverne (1793), and Cherubini's Les deux journ√©es (1800). While the rescue opera was primarily a French genre, the two best-known operas in the genre are not French. Ludwig van Beethoven's Fidelio is by far the most famous example today, and was also influenced by the German Singspiel. A work which is similar to Fidelio is Rossini's Torvaldo e Dorliska of 1815. Bed≈ôich Smetana's Dalibor (1868), which contains no spoken dialogue and which bears marks of Wagnerian influence, has nonetheless been called a rescue opera, in part because of its political themes. Style and themes Rescue opera was primarily a product of the French Revolution. The social changes of the period meant that opera must now appeal to the masses, and post-aristocratic, patriotic, idealistic themes--such as resistance to oppression, secularism, the political power of individuals and of people working together, and fundamental changes to the status quo--were popular. The Terror influenced stories of fear and imprisonment; a number of plots, including that of Fidelio and other operas based on the same libretto as well as that of Les deux journ√©es, were taken from real life. Stylistically, rescue opera was an outgrowth of the op√©ra comique, a bourgeois genre. Like op√©ras comiques, rescue operas contained spoken dialogue, popular musical idioms, and bourgeois characters. Works with libretti by Michel-Jean Sedaine were particularly influential. The influx of suspenseful or tragic subjects into op√©ra comique caused confusion in a system where tragedy was associated with through-composed scores and comedy with dialogue, precipitating a shift of musical theatre genres that paralleled the political shift which empowered the middle-class. Carl Dahlhaus writes, \\"No longer did the bourgeoisie function in comic casts merely as the butt of jokes; it demanded, and received, its part in the dignity of tragedy.\\" Some scholars describe the plots as featuring a deus ex machina like the ones present in opera seria plots, though the resolution still bore a closer resemblance to the endings of domestic comedies. However, others reject this term because the rescue is carried out through the actions of heroic people, rather than gods. John Bokina describes such endings, rather than as a \\"deus ex machina,\\" as a \\"populus ex machina,\\" in which virtuous human beings save the day. These operas were also influenced by gothic fiction and melodrama. A number of rescue operas were adaptations of British gothic literature. Rescue operas incorporated \\"local color\\" in the orchestra for operas set in exotic European locations. Folk songs and \\"picturesque\\" arias were used to indicate a setting; Lodo√Øska, for example, set in Poland, contains what may be the first polonaise in opera. However, melodies as such were avoided. Dramatic and emotional intensity, as conveyed through music, became increasingly important. The fortissimo directions ff and even fff were often to be found in scores, and chromatic scales, tremolos, and intervals such as the diminished seventh heightened tension onstage. Jean Le Sueur, whose La Caverne was one of the more influential rescue operas, wrote in his score for T√©l√©maque that arias should be sung with voix concentr√©e or in a manner that was tr√®s-concentr√®. Long instrumental passages descriptive of storms or battles were also present. Impact In its use of local color, heightened dramatic and emotional intensity, and inclusion of descriptive instrumental music, rescue opera preceded the works of German Romantics such as Carl Maria von Weber and, through him, Richard Wagner. Grandiosity in music and scenery, influenced by the political spectacles of the French Revolution and French Empire, influenced grand opera and the works of composers like Giacomo Meyerbeer.

After singing in his native province, Massard made his professional debut at the Paris Opera in 1952, as the High Priest in Samson et Dalila, shortly followed by Valentin in Faust. The same year, he also made his debut at the Aix-en-Provence Festival, as Thoas in Iphig√©nie en Tauride. His career rapidly took an international dimension with debuts in 1955, at La Scala and the Glyndebourne Festival, both as Ramiro in L'heure espagnole. Oreste in Iphig√©nie en Tauride was his debut role at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, the Royal Opera House in London, and the Edinburgh Festival. Massard also appeared in North and South America, notably at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, at Carnegie Hall in New York, the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. Henceforth considered one of the best French baritone of his generation, he was internationally acclaimed as Valentin in Faust, Escamillo in Carmen, Fieramosca in Benvenuto Cellini, and Golaud in Pell√©as et M√©lisande. Massard also enjoyed considerable success in the Italian repertory, singing Enrico in Lucia di Lammermoor, notably at the Paris Opera in 1960, opposite Joan Sutherland, and Riccardo in I puritani in London in 1961, again with Sutherland.

The ACA, which is separate from The Episcopal Church, is not a member of the Anglican Communion. It comprises five dioceses and around 5,200 members. History ACA Cathedral of St. John, Quincy, Illinois The Anglican Church in America was created in 1991 following extensive negotiations between the Anglican Catholic Church (ACC) and the American Episcopal Church (AEC). The effort was aimed at overcoming disunity in the Continuing Anglican movement. This was only partially successful. Most ACC parishes declined to enter the new ACA, resulting in a continuing existence for the ACC, while the remainder of its parishes and some of its bishops joined the AEC in forming the new church. In 1995, some parishes which had formerly been part of the AEC, primarily in the eastern states and the Pacific Northwest, withdrew from the ACA and formed the Anglican Province of America under the leadership of Bishop Walter Grundorf. The Traditional Anglican Communion had been seeking unity with the Roman Catholic Church while still retaining aspects of its Anglican heritage.Pope \\"wants personal prelature\\" for ex-Anglicans. The Catholic Herald. In 2007, in Portsmouth, England, all TAC bishops present accepted the ministry of the Bishop of Rome and the Cathechism of the Catholic Church and requested a means of establishing full communion. The petition was signed on the altar.http://www.theanglocatholic.com/2010/01/text-of-the-tac-petition-to-the- holy-see/ [Full text of the TAC petition to the Holy See.] The Vatican has a record of making some accommodations for Anglicans. In 1980, the Pastoral Provision was issued which allowed the creation of the Anglican Use and the establishment of Anglican Use parishes within dioceses of the United States. These parishes were initially composed of former members of the Episcopal Church. The Vatican answered the requests of various Anglican groups for full communion by issuing the apostolic constitution Anglicanorum Coetibus, thus opening the possibility of corporate reunion with Rome for some Anglicans. On March 3, 2010, in Orlando, Florida, the eight members of the House of Bishops of the ACA voted unanimously to accept the Pope's proposal by formally petitioning the Vatican for a personal ordinariate in the United States.http://www.theanglocatholic.com/2010/03/tac-formally-requests-personal- ordinariate-for-usa/ The bishops voted to have the ACA become part of the Roman Catholic Church along with 3,000 fellow communicants in 120 parishes in four dioceses across the country. See also: Anglicanorum Coetibus#Anglican Church in America. The ACA petition to establish an ordinariate in the United States urged it be established \\"as soon as possible\\" and indicated that they were establishing an interim governing council. In September 2010, however, the bishop of the ACA Diocese of the West, Daren K. Williams, announced that the bishops were divided on the matter and that parishes had left the church since the earlier news broke that union with the Roman Catholic Church was anticipated by the bishops. He also stated that talks between the ACA and the Anglican Province of America concerning a possible intercommunion agreement between the two were planned.http://www.virtueonline.org/portal/modules/news/article.php?storyid=13293 That agreement was finalized in September, 2011. As of 2016, a reconciliation committee with bishops and priests from the ACA and the APA, under the leadership of Bishop George Langberg, is working on ways to unite the two churches. On February 5, 2011, the chancellor of the Anglican Church in America issued a statement on behalf of the bishops of the ACA announcing that the church would remain a Continuing Anglican church. The statement also reported that one diocesan bishop who favored acceptance of the Pope's proposal had submitted his resignation and that approximately fifteen parishes were expected to leave the ACA with him.

Description R. ponticum is a dense, suckering shrub or small tree growing to tall, rarely . The leaves are evergreen, long and wide. The flowers are in diameter, violet-purple, often with small greenish-yellow spots or streaks. The fruit is a dry capsule long, containing numerous small seeds. The two subspecies are: *R. p. ponticum, found from Bulgaria, Turkey and Georgia *R. p. baeticum (Boiss. & Reut.) Hand.-Mazz. found in Spain and Portugal Distribution and habitat In Europe, its range includes Spain, northern Portugal, Great Britain, Ireland and southeast Bulgaria, which is the last surviving European Tertiary habitat. In Asia it occurs in Turkey, Lebanon, Georgia, the Krasnodar area of southern Russia, the Himalayas, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Northern Pakistan, and into the northern Republic of India ( Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand). It is the state flower of Jammu and Kashmir. Though it was in Great Britain before the last Ice Age, it did not recolonise afterwards and the modern ecology of the island developed without it. Its presence today in Great Britain is due to humans introducing it, and it easily naturalises and becomes a pest in some situations, often covering whole hillsides (especially in Snowdonia and the western British Isles). In the British Isles, it colonises moorlands, uplands, shady woodlands (alongside escaped laurels and the native holly) and in areas of acid soils, often in shaded areas. =Historical range= Fossil evidence shows it had a much wider range across most of southern and western Europe before the Late Glacial Maximum, or until about 20,000 years ago. It was noted by the botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort during his travels in the Near East in 1700‚Äì02, and so received its name from Linnaeus to identify the ancient kingdom on the south shores of the Black Sea, Pontus, in which it grew. At the other end of its range, in southern Spain, Linnaeus' friend and correspondent Clas Alstr√∂mer found it growing with oleander. It was introduced to Britain as an ornamental shrub in 1763, and later planted as cover for game birds. It is now considered to be an invasive species.Alice M. Coats, Garden Shrubs and Their Histories (1964) 1992, s.v. \\"Rhododendron\\"; http://www.countrysideinfo.co.uk/rhododen.htm#Introduction%20to%20Britain . Cultivation and uses Closeup of Rhododendron ponticum'Rhododendron ponticum subsp. baeticum is one of the most extensively cultivated rhododendrons in western Europe. It is used as an ornamental plant in its own right, and more frequently as a rootstock onto which other more attractive rhododendrons are grafted. The plants were first grown in Britain in the 1760s, supplied by Conrad Loddiges, and became widely distributed through the commercial nursery trade in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The roots readily send up suckers from below the graft, often allowing it to overtake the intended grafted rhododendron. Honey produced with pollen from the flowers of this plant can be quite poisonous, causing severe hypotension and bradycardia in humans if consumed in sufficient quantities, due to toxic diterpenes (grayanotoxins). In some parts of the world, a controlled dosage of the honey can be taken to induce hallucinations for spiritual or psychological purposes. Such areas include Nepal.https://themadhoney.com/ Invasive species Suckering of the root, together with its abundant seed production, has led to it becoming an invasive species over much of western Europe and in parts of New Zealand. Rhododendron control is a key element in nature conservation in those areas. Conservation organisations in Britain now believe R. ponticum has become \\"a severe problem\\" in the native Atlantic oakwoods of the west highlands of Scotland and in Wales, and on heathlands in southern England, crowding out the native flora. Clearance strategies have been developed, including the flailing and cutting down of plants with follow-up herbicide spraying. Injection of herbicide into individual plants has been found to be more precise and effective. A study in the journal Functional Ecology also showed that invasive rhododendron nectar was toxic to European honeybees (Apis mellifera), killing individuals within hours of consumption. It also paralyzed bees of the species Andrena carantonica, a solitary mining bee. Bees became paralysed and exhibited excessive grooming or other distress behaviours after feeding on Rhododendron nectar, and ate less food than bees fed a control nectar. In contrast the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) was not affected by the rhododendron nectar.

First success Sandler and Young appeared with Polly Bergen in her show at the Las Vegas Desert Inn Hotel and Casino, doing eleven minutes between her costume changes. This engagement was a smashing success and was the first of many the three would make together. Sandler and Young's careers were further advanced by their performance at the Coconut Grove nightclub in the Ambassador Hotel in Hollywood, where a long list of celebrities and movie stars, through word of mouth, attended their show. Among the people in attendance was Alan W. Livingston, then-president of Capitol Records, who immediately signed them to a recording contract. Fame During the following ten years, they released several albums for Capitol, including Side by Side, Pretty Things Come in Twos, On the Move, Honey Come Back, Odds & Ends, More and More, The \\"In Person\\" Album, and The Christmas World of Tony Sandler & Ralph Young. Their producer was future Capitol president Dave Cavanaugh, and their musical directors included Billy May, Jimmy Jones, Luther Henderson, and Sid Feller. Later, on other labels including Pickwick Records and PIP, the duo released their albums Sandler & Young: LIVE and Love Stories. During the release of their albums, Sandler & Young performed numerous concerts in clubs, showrooms, and concert halls throughout the US and Canada. In 1972 Sandler & Young appeared in an extended Christmas commercial from General Motors. This was part of a Canadian television special called Two Christmases, sponsored by GM. Starting in 1968, they returned frequently, and sometimes for several weeks, to Las Vegas, as headliners at the Sahara Hotel, the Dunes Hotel, the Flamingo Hilton (1969, 1970, 1972, 1973, 1974), Caesars Palace (1969) and the Thunderbird Hotel (1976). Guest shots followed on such national TV shows as The Ed Sullivan Show (7 episodes), The Mike Douglas Show (30 episodes), The Hollywood Palace, The Milton Berle Show, The Andy Williams Show, The Merv Griffin Show (26 episodes), The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (9 episodes), The David Frost Show (3 episodes), The Red Skelton Show (03/28/67), The Joey Bishop Show (2 episodes), That Show with Joan Rivers (12/13/68), and The Today Show, and Sandler and Young became one of the most popular acts in show business. In 1969, Sandler and Young hosted the popular Kraft Music Hall from London for NBC for 13 weeks. In the early 1970s, Sandler and Young started their own label, RALTON Records, and released the following albums on it: Once More With Feeling, You've Got a Friend, Sandler & Young Go Country, The Many Moods of Tony Sandler & Ralph Young, Pause a While and Sandler & Young Thank Irving Berlin. In the 1980s, the duo was parodied by Martin Short (playing Sandler) and Eugene Levy (playing Young) on the comedy TV show SCTV. Retirement In the mid-eighties, Young, then 65, retired from the concert stage to spend more time with his family in Palm Springs and Los Angeles. Sandler, the younger of the two by 16 years, was not ready to stop performing and toured the country with his repertoire of musical theatre and European songs as well as his one man-show Chevalier, Maurice and Me. In 1995 Capitol Records released the CD Sandler & Young, Great Gentlemen of Song. On special occasions, Sandler and Young re-teamed to perform to sellout crowds. Their last appearance together was at the 2003 All Stars benefit show Let Freedom Ring in Palm Springs to honor the victims of 9/11. Ralph Young died at his Palm Springs home on August 22, 2008 at the age of 90. Many of the Sandler and Young albums have been remastered and re-released on CD. Accolades In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to them.

British-led forces had been fighting in Italy since the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943. The Allied commanders decided to move the British and Canadian troops to fight in Northwestern Europe in the spring of 1945. Planning phase Operation Goldflake was the codename of the plan to arrange the move and to conceal the shifting of such a large number of troops to another war theatre. The move was publicized as a regrouping away from the Italian front to allow for recuperation of the troops. A massive amount of planning was needed, since troops and administrative centres were widely dispersed in southern Italy. Trains and road convoys had to be arranged, while not leaving any of the front-lines vulnerable to counter-attacks by the German forces. Troops and materiel were to be moved from ports at Naples and Leghorn in Italy to Marseilles in France, at the rate of 3700 people, 40 tanks, 650 wheeled vehicles, and 50 carriers each day. Conduct phase Embarkation began on February 22 and most trips to Marseille took two days. It was then a five-day drive to the Belgian frontier, a distance of By the end of April, over 60,000 troops and support personnel had been moved from Italy to North-western Europe. Speed was essential, but the Allies did not want the Germans to learn about the plans. The convoys would be vulnerable while in transit, so Operation \\"Penknife\\" was created to hide the movement of the Canadians out of Italy. A special, temporary organization, called 1st Canadian Special Basra Unit was created. \\"Basra\\" was the code name for the cover plan and the unit included 230 officers and men taken from other groups being disbanded (such as the no. 1 Anti-Malaria Control Unit). Men would drive throughout the area in Italy where the Germans thought the Canadians were located and post location signs that were then moved the next day. All Canadian clubs, hostels, leave centres and hospitals were kept open. The Canadian forces newsletter, \\"The Maple Leaf\\" continued to be published in Rome until mid-March. The Royal Canadian Corps of Signals continued to maintain the normal level of wireless traffic by sending dummy messages. Their success was shown by the efforts of the Germans to jam these messages. German documents captured after the war showed that Operation Penknife was successful in concealing the movement of Canadian troops from Italy to Belgium. Until late March, German intelligence maps showed the Canadians to be at various places in Italy. On March 17, when all Canadians were either in Belgium or northern France, the Germans still believed the Canadians were in the Ancona area, although the exact location of the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade was unknown. Only in mid-April did the German maps show the absence of Canadian troops. Security was eventually broken by a Canadian journalist on April 3, 1945, announcing that all Canadian infantry and armoured troops had been reunited under the command of General Harry Crerar. Since the Allied command still had reason to believe the Germans were uncertain of the location of the Canadians, permission to make an official announcement of the transfer was delayed until April 20. Canadians were officially informed on April 23, 1945, although media silence had only been maintained by censorship, since it had already become common knowledge for many in Canada.

Navy Regulations are issued by the Secretary of the Navy, and are permanent regulations of general applicability, as opposed to other regulations that he or she may issue in accordance with law. The Navy Regulations serve in effect much as a vehicle of implementation of Title 10 of the United States Code as it pertains to the Naval Services. However, Navy Regulations do not take legal precedence over any order or directive issued by either the President or Secretary of Defense, or of an Act of Congress. The Chief of Naval Operations is responsible for maintaining the Navy Regulations, and for ensuring that they conform to the current needs of the Department of the Navy. Other directives issued within the Department of the Navy may not conflict with, alter or amend any provision of Navy Regulations. Any additions, changes or deletions to the U.S. Navy Regulations must be approved by the Secretary of the Navy. History Navy Regulations began with the enactment by the Second Continental Congress of the \\"Rules for the Regulation of the Navy of the United Colonies\\" on November 28, 1775. The first issuance by the United States Government which covered this subject matter was \\"An Act for the Government of the Navy of the United States,\\" enacted on March 2, 1799. This was followed the next year by \\"An Act for the Better Government of the Navy of the United States.\\" In the years preceding the American Civil War, twelve successor publications were promulgated under a number of titles by the President, the Navy Department and the Secretary of the Navy. A decision by the Attorney General that the last of the pre-Civil War issuances was invalid led to the inclusion in the 1862 naval appropriations bill of a provision that \\"the orders, regulations, and instructions heretofore issued by the Secretary of the Navy be, and they are hereby, recognized as the regulations of the Navy Department, subject, however, to such alterations as the Secretary of the Navy may adopt, with the approbation of the President of the United States.\\" Thirteen editions of Navy Regulations were published in accordance with this authority (later codified as Section 1547, Revised Statutes) between 1865 and 1948. The 1973 edition of Navy Regulations was published under authority of , which provided that \\"United States Navy Regulations shall be issued by the Secretary of the Navy with the approval of the President.\\" In 1981, this provision was amended to eliminate the requirement for presidential approval. While leaving this provision unaffected, Congress enacted the Goldwater- Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99‚Äì443), which granted each of the service secretaries the explicit authority to prescribe regulations to carry out his or her statutory functions, powers and duties.

Overview Panteleimon Kulish, born 7 August 1819 in Voronizh (now in Sumy Oblast), d 14 February 1897 in Motronivka, Glukhovsky Uyezd Chernigov Governorate. Prominent writer, historian, ethnographer, and translator. He was born into an impoverished Cossack-gentry family. After completing only five years at the Novhorod-Siverskyi gymnasium he enrolled at Kiev University in 1837 but was not allowed to finish his studies because he was not a noble. He obtained a teaching position in Lutsk in 1840. There he wrote his first historical novel in Russian Mykhailo Charnyshenko, or Little Russia Eighty Years Ago (2 vols, 1843). Mykhailo Maksymovych promoted Kulish's literary efforts and published several of his early stories. His first longer work written in Ukrainian was the epic poem Ukraina (1843). In 1843‚Äì5 Kulish taught in Kiev and studied Ukrainian history and ethnography. There he befriended Taras Shevchenko, Mykola Kostomarov, and Vasyl Bilozersky; their circle later became the nucleus of the secret Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius. Panteleimon Kulish was the first person known to translate the whole of the Bible into the modern Ukrainian language and was also the first to write historical novels in Ukrainian. His most famous contribution in this field was the novel Chorna Rada (The Black Council) which was set in Cossack times. Kulish was also active in historical writing, composing a brief history of Ukraine in verse (under the title Ukraina) and a much larger History of the Reunification of Rus in three volumes. The latter dealt with the era of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky in the seventeenth century. His two-volume collection of Ukrainian folklore, Notes on Southern Rus retains its scholarly significance to the present day. Life During his early years at the University of Kiev, Kulish came under the influence of the historian and literary figure Mykhaylo Maksymovych who turned his attention to his native Ukrainian culture. In the 1840s, he became close to the poet Taras Shevchenko, and the historian Mykola Kostomarov and participated in the illegal Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius which envisioned a Ukrainian national rebirth, including national independence, within a free and equal Slavic federation. In 1847, Kulish was arrested for his participation in this organization, and spent some time in prison and a few years in exile. In the late 1850s, he was reunited with Kostomarov and others of the Cyril-Methodian \\"Brethren\\" and participated in the Ukrainian journal Osnova (The Foundation). At this time, he published his famous Notes on Southern Rus' in which he pioneered a new Ukrainian orthography for the Ukrainian vernacular, the Kulishivka alphabet, based on phonetics rather than etymology. This later became the basis of the modern written Ukrainian language. In the 1860s and 1870s, he gradually turned more conservative and began to criticize Shevchenko, the Cossack revolts, and the ideal of the Cossacks as the defenders of popular liberty. Eventually, despite Tsarist repression of Ukrainian culture and the ban on the appearance of the Ukrainian language in print, he developed a theory that Ukraine and Russia should be politically united but divergent in culture, an approach which won few adherents among the Ukrainian intelligentsia of the time. Nevertheless, this conservative approach to Ukrainian affairs was never completely extinguished and was later resurrected in a different form by other Ukrainian political thinkers such as Vyacheslav Lypynsky, Stepan Tomashivsky, and others. In the 1880s, Kulish visited Austrian Galicia and, in light of the ban on Ukrainian publications in the Russian Empire, cooperated with the Ukrainian cultural and political leaders there. Thus he was one of the first Ukrainian figures to, at least in part, successfully bridge the gap between Russian and Austrian Ukraine. He spent his last years isolated on his homestead in eastern Ukraine. During these years he translated a great deal of west European literature, including Shakespeare, into Ukrainian. On 7 August 2019 a Google Doodle was created to celebrate Kulish's 200th birthdayPanteleimon Kulish‚Äôs  Adaptations  According to his novel Black Council, dedicated to the loss of Ukrainian independence in the 17th century, at the Dovzhenko Film Studios Mykola Zaseyev-Rudenko created the 9 series television series (2000).

Volunteers had to engage in extensive cleaning and renovation in order to convert the former coffee-house into a library. They constructed shelves for the books, and furniture was donated. Books were obtained through donations from area residents, the Suburban Library System, and the Illinois State Library. Fundraisers, including bake sales, book sales, and paper drives were held to secure additional funding. Upon opening, the library was staffed entirely with volunteers. In 1974, village residents approved a referendum to establish the Richton Park Public Library District. With rapid growth of the library, village residents and staff realized that the storefront facility was inadequate. In 1979, the community agreed to lease the old village hall to the District to facilitate expansion. The new library opened on March 30, 1981 at 4045 Sauk Trail after an extensive renovation. The next few years saw tremendous growth in the population of Richton Park, and with it an increased demand for library services. In the fall of 1984, a new addition was built, offering more room for books, services, and people. Use of the library continued to grow throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1995, voters approved funding to double the size of the library. With a larger building, more services were added, including new computers with Internet access. In the spring of 2012, a referendum was passed to allow the library to build a larger facility to account for population growth. In September of 2014, the Richton Park Library opened a new location that is much larger and includes significantly more space for library materials, program areas, and study rooms. This new building is located at 22310 Latonia Late, Richton Park, IL, 60471.

The etymology of the site's name comes from Yukatek Maya, combining the roots xel (\\"spring\\") and ha' (\\"water\\"). The lagoon and inlet at Xelha has been turned into a commercial water theme park known as Xel-Ha Park. History The beach of Xel-H√° \\"House of Birds\\" in Xelha. Mural Paintings. 300px \\"Palace\\" in Xelha. Columns. The site of Xelha is located south of the modern township of Playa del Carmen, in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico. The evidence is inconclusive concerning a founding date for Xel-Ha, but it was occupied by the 1st Century and active during Classic and Postclassic times, with most of the buildings being rebuilt in the Late Postclassic. It was probably not fully abandoned until the 19th Century. A stela with an Early Classic date of 9.6.10.0.0 (AD 564) from Xel-Ha was discovered in 1841 by Stephens and Catherwood. Xelha was one of several key ports of the Maya city of Coba; others included Tancah and Tulum. It was likely used as a point of intercultural exchange between the Maya and other sea-navigating peoples between the 7th and 12th centuries, and eventually was a beacon to which European colonial navigators were drawn. The location of Xelha was used as a base by Spanish forces, during the ultimately unsuccessful first expedition (1527‚Äì28) led by the conquistador Francisco de Montejo (the Elder).Clendinnen (1987, p.21); Wright (2005, p.162) Montejo, who had obtained a charter from the Spanish Crown in 1526 to pacify the Yucat√°n Peninsula,Clendinnen (1987, p.20) crossed over from the island of Cozumel to make landfall at Xelha's lagoons, a short distance from a local Maya village. He set about establishing what was intended to be the first Spanish settlement on the peninsula, which he named \\"Salamanca de Xelha\\" after his birthplace in western Spain, Salamanca. However, the supplies he had brought soon proved inadequate to the task of sustaining the venture. Despite attempts to commandeer and raid neighboring Maya settlements for food, his fledgling settlement lost some fifty men within the first two months to disease and privation.Clendinnen (1987, p.21) In an action reminiscent of Hern√°n Cort√©s, Montejo ordered the scuttling of his ships in the face of growing discontent, forcing them to remain.See Clendinnen (1987, p.21); Restall (2003, p.19); Wright (2005, p.162). Restall (loc cit.) maintains that while \\"[a]rguably this was in imitation of Cort√©s\\", it could also be attributed to general tactical procedures relied upon at the time. Eventually Montejo's forces stabilised sufficiently for him to mount explorations from his temporary encampment, heading out with some 125 men north towards Ecab near Cape Catoche. The sortie returned several months later after losing half of his men in a battle against the Maya near Ake, and to disease. The 65 conquistadores who had been left behind at Salamanca de Xelha fared no better with many being massacred in Maya raids, leaving Montejo with only about a third of his original complement.Athena Review (1999); Clendinnen (1987, p.21) The fortuitous arrival at that point of another of his ships from Santo Domingo with provisions and reinforcements prevented further disaster, and an expedition was sent out to the south towards the Maya township of Chetumal. This also failed to gain any foothold, and within eighteen months of Montejo's first landfall in Yucat√°n, the encampment at Salamanca de Xelha and the eastern coast were abandoned.Athena Review (1999); Clendinnen (1987, pp.21‚Äì23) Notes References : : : : : : : : : : : Category:Maya sites in Quintana Roo Category:Natural history of Quintana Roo Category:Lagoons of Mexico Category:Former populated places in Mexico Category:Tourism in Mexico Category:Landforms of Quintana Roo ","title":"Xelha"},{"id":"6598987","text":"The Menier family of Noisiel, France, was a prominent family of chocolatiers who began as pharmaceutical manufacturers in Paris in 1816.

Metropolitan Museum of Art. pederastic courtship scene on an Athenian black-figure amphora from the 5th century B.C. The history of erotic depictions includes paintings, sculpture, photographs, dramatic arts, music and writings that show scenes of a sexual nature throughout time. They have been created by nearly every civilization, ancient and modern. Early cultures often associated the sexual act with supernatural forces and thus their religion is intertwined with such depictions. In Asian countries such as India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Japan and China, representations of sex and erotic art have specific spiritual meanings within native religions. The ancient Greeks and Romans produced much art and decoration of an erotic nature, much of it integrated with their religious beliefs and cultural practices. In more recent times, as communication technologies evolved, each new technique, such as printing, photography, motion pictures and computers, has been adapted to display and disseminate these depictions. Attitudes through history In early times, erotic depictions were often a subset of the indigenous or religious art of cultures and as such were not set aside or treated differently than any other type. The modern concept of pornography did not exist until the Victorian era. Its current definition was added in the 1860s, replacing the older one meaning writings about prostitutes. It first appeared in an English medical dictionary in 1857 defined as \\"a description of prostitutes or of prostitution, as a matter of public hygiene.\\"Dunglison, Robley (1857). Medical lexicon. A dictionary of medical science, 1857 edition, s.v. \\"Pornography\\". From the Oxford English Dictionary, second edition (1989), Oxford University Press, Retrieved on November 30, 2006. By 1864, the first version of the modern definition had appeared in Webster's Dictionary: \\"licentious painting employed to decorate the walls of rooms sacred to bacchanalian orgies, examples of which exist in Pompeii.\\"An American dictionary of the English language, new and revised edition (1864), s.v. \\"Pornography\\". From the Oxford English Dictionary, second edition (1989), Oxford University Press, Retrieved on November 30, 2006. This was the beginning of what today refers to explicit pictures in general. Though some specific sex acts were regulated or prohibited by earlier laws, merely looking at objects or images depicting them was not outlawed in any country until 1857. In some cases, the possession of certain books, engravings or image collections was outlawed, but the trend to compose laws that actually restricted viewing sexually explicit things in general was a Victorian construct. When large-scale excavations of Pompeii were undertaken in the 1860s, much of the erotic art of the Romans came to light, shocking the Victorians who saw themselves as the intellectual heirs of the Roman Empire. They did not know what to do with the frank depictions of sexuality, and endeavored to hide them away from everyone but upper-class scholars. The movable objects were locked away in the Secret Museum in Naples, and what could not be removed was covered and cordoned off so as to not corrupt the sensibilities of women, children and the working class. England's (and the world's) first laws criminalising pornography were enacted with the passage of the Obscene Publications Act of 1857. Despite their occasional repression, depictions of erotic themes have been common for millennia. Pornography has existed throughout recorded history and has adapted to each new medium, including photography, cinema, video, and computers and the internet. The first instances of modern pornography date back to the sixteenth century when sexually explicit images differentiated itself from traditional sexual representations in European art by combining the traditionally explicit representation of sex and the moral norms of those times.Shepard, 2003 The first amendment prohibits the U.S. government from restricting speech based on its content. Indecent speech is protected and may be regulated, but not banned. Obscenity is the judicially recognized exception to the first amendment. Historically, this exception was used in an attempt to ban information about sex education, studies on nudism, and sexually explicit literature. In the 1970s in the United States, attempts were made to shut down the pornography industry by prosecuting individuals on prostitution charges. In the case of People v. Freeman, the California Supreme Court ruled to distinguish prostitution as an individual taking part in sexual activities in exchange for money versus an individual who is portraying a sexual act on- screen as part of their acting performance. The case was not appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, thus it is only binding in the state of California. Early depictions The Venus of Willendorf, a figurine with exaggerated sexual characteristicsA prehistoric petroglyph of a vulva =Palaeolithic and mesolithic= Among the oldest surviving examples of erotic depictions are Paleolithic cave paintings and carvings. Some of the more common images are of animals, hunting scenes and depictions of human genitalia. Nude human beings with exaggerated sexual characteristics are depicted in some Paleolithic paintings and artifacts (e.g. Venus figurines). Recently discovered cave art at Creswell Crags in England, thought to be more than 12,000 years old, includes some symbols that may be stylized versions of female genitalia. As there is no direct evidence of the use of these objects, it is speculated that they may have been used in religious rituals, or for a more directly sexual purpose. Archaeologists in Germany reported in April 2005 that they had found what they believe is a 7,200-year-old scene depicting a male figurine bending over a female figurine in a manner suggestive of sexual intercourse. The male figure has been named Adonis von Zschernitz. =Mesopotamia= A vast number of artifacts have been discovered from ancient Mesopotamia depicting explicit sexual intercourse. Glyptic art from the Sumerian Early Dynastic Period frequently shows scenes of frontal sex in the missionary position. In Mesopotamian votive plagues from the early second millennium BC, the man is usually shown entering the woman from behind while she bends over, drinking beer through a straw. Middle Assyrian lead votive figurines often represent the man standing and penetrating the woman as she rests on top of an altar. Scholars have traditionally interpreted all these depictions as scenes of ritual sex, but they are more likely to be associated with the cult of Inanna, the goddess of sex and prostitution. Many sexually explicit images were found in the temple of Inanna at Assur, which also contained models of male and female sexual organs, including stone phalli, which may have been worn around the neck as an amulet or used to decorate cult statues, and clay models of the female vulva. =Egypt= Depictions of sexual intercourse were not part of the general repertory of ancient Egyptian formal art, but rudimentary sketches of sexual intercourse have been found on pottery fragments and in graffiti. The Turin Erotic Papyrus (Papyrus 55001) is a by Egyptian papyrus scroll discovered at Deir el-Medina, the last two-thirds of which consist of a series of twelve vignettes showing men and women in various sexual positions. The men in the illustrations are \\"scruffy, balding, short, and paunchy\\" with exaggeratedly large genitalia and do not conform to Egyptian standards of physical attractiveness, but the women are nubile and they are shown with objects from traditional erotic iconography, such as convolvulus leaves and, in some scenes, they are even holding items traditionally associated with Hathor, the goddess of love, such as lotus flowers, monkeys, and sistra. The scroll was probably painted in the Ramesside period (1292-1075 BC) and its high artistic quality indicates that was produced for a wealthy audience. No other similar scrolls have yet been discovered. =Greek and Roman= The ancient Greeks often painted sexual scenes on their ceramics, many of them famous for being some of the earliest depictions of same-sex relations and pederasty. Greek art often portrays sexual activity, but it is impossible to distinguish between what to them was illegal or immoral since the ancient Greeks did not have a concept of pornography. Their art simply reflects scenes from daily life, some more sexual than others. Carved phalli can be seen in places of worship such as the temple of Dionysus on Delos, while a common household item and protective charm was the herm, a statue consisting of a head on a square plinth with a prominent phallus on the front. The Greek male ideal had a small penis, an aesthetic the Romans later adopted. The Greeks also created the first well-known instance of lesbian eroticism in the West, with Sappho's Hymn to Aphrodite and other homoerotic works. A Priapus figure from Pompeii. Large phalli were considered undesirable for men to possess and often depicted for comic effect in ancient Rome. There are numerous sexually explicit paintings and sculptures from the ruined Roman buildings in Pompeii and Herculaneum but the original purposes of the depictions can vary. On one hand, in the Villa of the Mysteries, there is a ritual flagellation scene that is clearly associated with a religious cult and this image can be seen as having religious significance rather than sexual. On the other hand, graphic paintings in a brothel advertise sexual services in murals above each door. In Pompeii, phalli and testicles engraved in the sidewalks were created to aid visitors in finding their way by pointing to the prostitution and entertainment district as well as general decoration. The Romans considered depictions of sex to be decoration in good taste, and indeed the pictures reflect the sexual mores and practices of their culture, as on the Warren Cup. Sex acts that were considered taboo (such as oral sex) were depicted in baths for comic effect. Large phalli were often used near entryways, for the phallus was a good-luck charm, and the carvings were common in homes. One of the first objects excavated when the complex was discovered was a marble statue showing the god Pan having sex with a goat, a detailed depiction of bestiality considered so obscene that it was not on public display until the year 2000 and remains in the Secret Museum, Naples. =Peruvian= The Moche of Peru are another ancient people that sculpted explicit scenes of sex into their pottery. At least 500 Moche ceramics have sexual themes. The most frequently depicted act is anal sex, with scenes of vaginal penetration being very rare. Most pairs are heterosexual, with carefully carved genitalia to show that the anus, rather than the vagina, is being penetrated. Often, an infant is depicted breastfeeding while the couple has sex. Fellatio is sometimes represented, but cunnilingus is absent. Some depict male skeletons masturbating, or being masturbated by living women. Rafael Larco Hoyle speculates that their purpose was much different than that of other early cultures. He states that the Moche believed that the world of the dead was the exact opposite of the world of the living. Therefore, for funeral offerings, they made vessels showing sex acts such as masturbation, fellatio and anal sex that would not result in offspring. The hope was that in the world of the dead, they would take on their opposite meaning and result in fertility. The erotic pottery of the Moche is depicted in Hoyle's book Checan.book-review (In British Journal of Aesthetics, Vol. 6, 1966) of Checan =Asia= Shunga (Japan) depicting a man sucking a woman's breasts. Prince and his lady on a terrace at night (India) There has been a long tradition of erotic painting in the East. India, Japan, China, Persia and other lands produced copious quantities of art celebrating the human faculty of love. The works depict love between men and women as well as same-sex love. One of the most famous ancient sex manuals was the Kama Sutra, written by VƒÅtsyƒÅyana in India during the first few centuries CE. Another notable treatise on human sexuality is The Perfumed Garden by the Tunisian Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Nafzawi, dating to the fifteenth century. In Japan, the erotic art found its greatest flowering in the medium of the woodblock prints. The style is known as and some of its classic practitioners (e.g. Harunobu, Utamaro) produced a large number of works. Painted hand scrolls were also very popular. Shunga appeared in the 13th century and continued to grow in popularity despite occasional attempts to suppress them, the first of which was a ban on erotic books known as issued by the Tokugawa shogunate in Ky≈çh≈ç 7 (1722). Shunga only ceased to be produced in the 19th century when photography was invented. The Chinese tradition of the erotic was also extensive, with examples of the art dating back as far as the Yuan Dynasty (1271‚Äì1368). The erotic art of China reached its peak during the latter part of the Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644). In both China and Japan, eroticism played a prominent role in the development of the novel. The Tale of Genji, the work by an 11th-century Japanese noblewoman that is often called \\"the world's first novel,\\" traces the many affairs of its hero in discreet but carnal language. From 16th-century China, the still more explicit novel The Plum in the Golden Vase has been called one of the four great classical novels of Chinese literature. The Tale of Genji has been celebrated in Japan since it was written, but The Plum in the Golden Vase was suppressed as pornography for much of its history, and replaced on the list of four classics. =European= Erotic scenes in medieval illuminated manuscripts also appeared, but were seen only by those who could afford the extremely expensive hand-made books. Most of these drawings occur in the margins of books of hours. Many medieval scholars think that the pictures satisfied the medieval cravings for both erotic pictures and religion in one book, especially since it was often the only book someone owned. Other scholars think the drawings in the margins were a kind of moral caution, but the depiction of priests and other ranking officials engaged in sex acts suggests political origins as well. It was not until the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg that sexually explicit images entered into any type of mass circulation in the western world. Before that time, erotic images, being hand made and expensive, were limited to upper class males. Even the British Museum had a Secretum filled with a collection of ancient erotica donated by the upper class doctor, George Witt in 1865. The remains of the collection, including his scrapbooks, still reside in Cupboard 55, though the majority of it has recently been integrated with the museum's other collections. Beginnings of mass circulation =Printing= Erotic engraving supposedly after Agostino Carracci (1557‚Äì1602) Die Nacht - Night by Sebald Beham (1548) 108 x 78 mm. Prints became very popular in Europe from the middle of the fifteenth century, and because of their compact nature, were very suitable for erotic depictions that did not need to be permanently on display. Nudity and the revival of classical subjects were associated from very early on in history of the print, and many prints of subjects from mythological subjects were clearly in part an excuse for erotic material; the engravings of Giovanni Battista Palumba in particular. An earthier eroticism is seen in a printing plate of 1475-1500 for an Allegory of Copulation where a young couple are having sex, with the woman's legs high in the air, at one end of a bench, while at the other end a huge penis, with legs and wings and a bell tied around the bottom of the glans, is climbing onto the bench. Although the plate has been used until worn out, then re-engraved and heavily used again, none of the contemporary impressions printed, which probably ran into the hundreds, have survived. The loves of classical gods, especially those of Jupiter detailed in Ovid provided many subjects where actual sex was the key moment in the story, and its depiction was felt to be justified. In particular Leda and the Swan, where the god appeared as a swan and seduced the woman, was depicted very explicitly; it seems that this‚Äîrather strangely‚Äîwas considered more acceptable because he appeared as a bird. For a period ending in the early 16th century the boundaries of what could be depicted in for display in the semi-privacy of a Renaissance palace seemed uncertain. Michelangelo's Leda was a fairly large painting showing sex in progress, and one of the hundreds of illustrations to the book the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili of 1499 shows Leda and the Swan having sex on top of a triumphal car watched by a crowd. In the 16th century an attempt to print erotic material caused a scandal when the well-known Italian artist Marcantonio Raimondi published I Modi in 1524, an illustrated book of 16 \\"postures\\" or sexual positions. Raimondi was subsequently imprisoned by the Pope Clement VII and all copies of the illustrations were destroyed. Raimondi based the engravings on a series of erotic paintings that Giulio Romano was doing as a commission for the Palazzo del Te in Mantua. Though the two depictions were very similar, only Raimondi was prosecuted because his engravings were capable of being seen by the public. Romano did not know of the engravings until Pietro Aretino came to see the original paintings while Romano was still working on them. Aretino then composed sixteen explicit sonnets (\\"both in your cunt and your behind, my prick will make me happy, and you happy and blissful\\") to go with the paintings and secured Raimondi's release from prison. I Modi was then published a second time in 1527, with the poems and the pictures, making this the first time erotic text and images were combined, though the papacy once more seized all the copies it could find. Raimondi escaped prison that time, but the censorship was so strict that no complete editions of the original printings have ever been found. The text in existence is only a copy of a copy that was discovered 400 years later. Das Liebespaar (The Lovers) wrongly attributed to Peter Fendi In the 17th century, numerous examples of pornographic or erotic literature began to circulate. These included L'Ecole des Filles, a French work printed in 1655 that is considered to be the beginning of pornography in France. It consists of an illustrated dialogue between two women, a 16-year-old and her more worldly cousin, and their explicit discussions about sex. The author remains anonymous to this day, though a few suspected authors served light prison sentences for supposed authorship of the work. In his famous diary, Samuel Pepys records purchasing a copy for solitary reading and then burning it so that it would not be discovered by his wife; \\"the idle roguish book, L'escholle de filles; which I have bought in plain binding‚Ä¶ because I resolve, as soon as I have read it, to burn it.\\" Juliette by the Marquis de Sade During the Enlightenment, many of the French free-thinkers began to exploit pornography as a medium of social criticism and satire. Libertine pornography was a subversive social commentary and often targeted the Catholic Church and general attitudes of sexual repression. The market for the mass-produced, inexpensive pamphlets soon became the bourgeoisie, making the upper class worry, as in England, that the morals of the lower class and weak-minded would be corrupted since women, slaves and the uneducated were seen as especially vulnerable during that time. The stories and illustrations (sold in the galleries of the Palais Royal, along with the services of prostitutes) were often anti-clerical and full of misbehaving priests, monks and nuns, a tradition that in French pornography continued into the 20th century. In the period leading up to the French Revolution, pornography was also used as political commentary; Marie Antoinette was often targeted with fantasies involving orgies, lesbian activities and the paternity of her children, and rumours circulated about the supposed sexual inadequacies of Louis XVI. During and after the Revolution, the famous works of the Marquis de Sade were printed. They were often accompanied by illustrations and served as political commentary for their author. The English answer to this was Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (later abridged and renamed Fanny Hill) written in 1748 by John Cleland. While the text satirised the literary conventions and fashionable manners of 18th century England, it was more scandalous for depicting a woman, the narrator, enjoying and even reveling in sexual acts with no dire moral or physical consequences. The text is hardly explicit as Cleland wrote the entire book using euphemisms for sex acts and body parts, employing 50 different ones just for the term penis. Two small earthquakes were credited to the book by the Bishop of London and Cleland was arrested and briefly imprisoned, but Fanny Hill continued to be published and is one of the most reprinted books in the English language. However, it was not legal to own this book in the United States until 1963 and in the United Kingdom until 1970. =Photography= 19th-century nude photograph In 1839, Louis Daguerre presented the first practical process of photography to the French Academy of Sciences. Unlike earlier photographic methods, his daguerreotypes had stunning quality and detail and did not fade with time. Artists adopted the new technology as a new way to depict the nude form, which in practice was the feminine form. In so doing, at least initially, they tried to follow the styles and traditions of the art form. Traditionally, an acad√©mie was a nude study done by a painter to master the female (or male) form. Each had to be registered with the French government and approved or they could not be sold. Soon, nude photographs were being registered as acad√©mie and marketed as aids to painters. However, the realism of a photograph as opposed to the idealism of a painting made many of these intrinsically erotic. The daguerreotypes were not without drawbacks, however. The main difficulty was that they could only be reproduced by photographing the original picture since each image was an original and the all-metal process does not use negatives. In addition, the earliest daguerreotypes had exposure times ranging from three to fifteen minutes, making them somewhat impractical for portraiture. Unlike earlier drawings, action could not be shown. The poses that the models struck had to be held very still for a long time. Because of this, the standard pornographic image shifted from one of two or more people engaged in sex acts to a solitary woman exposing her genitals. Since one picture could cost a week's salary, the audience for these nudes mostly consisted of artists and the upper echelon of society. It was cheaper to hire a prostitute and experience the sex acts than it was to own a picture of them in the 1840s. Stereoscopy was invented in 1838 and became extremely popular for daguerreotypes, including the erotic images. This technology produced a type of three dimensional view that suited erotic images quite well. Although thousands of erotic daguerreotypes were created, only around 800 are known to survive; however, their uniqueness and expense meant that they were once the toys of rich men. Due to their rarity, the works can sell for more than 10,000 GBP. In 1841, William Fox Talbot patented the calotype process, the first negative-positive process, making possible multiple copies. This invention permitted an almost limitless number of prints to be produced from a glass negative. Also, the reduction in exposure time made a true mass market for pornographic pictures possible. The technology was immediately employed to reproduce nude portraits. Paris soon became the centre of this trade. In 1848 only thirteen photography studios existed in Paris; by 1860, there were over 400. Most of them profited by selling illicit pornography to the masses who could now afford it. The pictures were also sold near train stations, by traveling salesmen and women in the streets who hid them under their dresses. They were often produced in sets (of four, eight or twelve), and exported internationally, mainly to England and the United States. Both the models and the photographers were commonly from the working class, and the artistic model excuse was increasingly hard to use. By 1855, no more photographic nudes were being registered as acad√©mie, and the business had gone underground to escape prosecution. Eadweard Muybridge: Woman walking with fishing pole (detail) The Victorian pornographic tradition in the UK had three main elements: French photographs, erotic prints (sold in shops in Holywell Street, a long vanished London thoroughfare, swept away by the Aldwych), and printed literature. The ability to reproduce photographs in bulk assisted the rise of a new business individual, the porn dealer. Many of these dealers took advantage of the postal system to send out photographic cards in plain wrappings to their subscribers. Therefore, the development of a reliable international postal system facilitated the beginnings of the pornography trade. Victorian pornography had several defining characteristics. It reflected a very mechanistic view of the human anatomy and its functions. Science, the new obsession, was used to ostensibly study the human body. Consequently, the sexuality of the subject is often depersonalised, and is without any passion or tenderness. At this time, it also became popular to depict nude photographs of women of exotic ethnicities, under the umbrella of science. Studies of this type can be found in the work of Eadweard Muybridge. Although he photographed both men and women, the women were often given props like market baskets and fishing poles, making the images of women thinly disguised erotica. Parallel to the British printing history, photographers and printers in France frequently turned to the medium of postcards, producing great numbers of them. Such cards came to be known in the US as \\"French postcards\\". Magazines During the Victorian period, illegal pornographic periodicals such as The Pearl, which ran for eighteen issues between 1879 and 1880, circulated clandestinely among circles of elite urban gentlemen.Thomas J. Joudrey, \\"Against Communal Nostalgia: Reconstructing Sociality in the Pornographic Ballad,\\" Victorian Poetry 54.4 (2017). In 1880, halftone printing was used to reproduce photographs inexpensively for the first time. The invention of halftone printing took pornography and erotica in new directions at the beginning of the 20th century. The new printing processes allowed photographic images to be reproduced easily in black and white, whereas printers were previously limited to engravings, woodcuts and line cuts for illustrations. This was the first format that allowed pornography to become a mass market phenomena, it now being more affordable and more easily acquired than any previous form. First appearing in France, the new magazines featured nude (often, burlesque actresses were hired as models) and semi-nude photographs on the cover and throughout; while these would now be termed softcore, they were quite shocking for the time. The publications soon either masqueraded as \\"art magazines\\" or publications celebrating the new cult of naturism, with titles such as Photo Bits, Body in Art, Figure Photography, Nude Living and Modern Art for Men. Health and Efficiency, started in 1900, was a typical naturist magazine in Britain. Another early form of pornography were comic books known as Tijuana bibles that began appearing in the U.S. in the 1920s and lasted until the publishing of glossy colour men's magazines commenced. These were crude hand drawn scenes often using popular characters from cartoons and culture. In the 1940s, the word \\"pinup\\" was coined to describe pictures torn from men's magazines and calendars and \\"pinned up\\" on the wall by U.S. soldiers in World War II. While the '40s images focused mostly on legs, by the '50s, the emphasis shifted to breasts. Betty Grable and Marilyn Monroe were two of the most popular pinup models. In the second half of the 20th century, pornography evolved into the men's magazines such as Playboy and Modern Man of the 1950s. In fact, the beginning of the modern men's glossy magazine (or girlie magazine) can be traced to the 1953 purchase by Hugh Hefner of a photograph of Marilyn Monroe to use as the centerfold of his new magazine Playboy. Soon, this type of magazine was the primary medium in which pornography was consumed. In postwar Britain digest magazines such as Beautiful Britons, Spick and Span, with their interest in nylons and underwear and the racier Kamera published by Harrison Marks were incredibly popular. The creative force behind Kamera was Harrison Marks' partner Pamela Green. These magazines featured nude or semi-nude women in extremely coy or flirtatious poses with no hint of pubic hair. Penthouse, started by Bob Guccione in England in 1965, took a different approach. Women looked indirectly at the camera, as if they were going about their private idylls. This change of emphasis was influential in erotic depictions of women. Penthouse was also the first magazine to publish pictures that included pubic hair and full frontal nudity, both of which were considered beyond the bounds of the erotic and in the realm of pornography at the time. In the late 1960s, magazines began to move into more explicit displays often focusing on the buttocks as standards of what could be legally depicted and what readers wanted to see changed. By the 1970s, they were focusing on the pubic area and eventually, by the 1990s, featured sexual penetration, lesbianism and homosexuality, group sex, masturbation, and fetishes in the more hard-core magazines such as Hustler. Magazines for every taste and fetish were soon created due to the low cost of producing them. Magazines for the gay community flourished, the most notable and one of the first being Physique Pictorial, started in 1951 by Bob Mizer when his attempt to sell the services of male models; however, Athletic Model Guild photographs of them failed. It was published in black and white, in a very clear yet photographic manner celebrating the male form and was published for nearly 50 years. The magazine was innovative in its use of props and costumes to depict the now standard gay icons like cowboys, gladiators and sailors. Moving pictures Images from early Austrian erotic films by Johann Schwarzer. Production of erotic films commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture. Two of the earliest pioneers were Frenchmen Eug√®ne Pirou and Albert Kirchner. Kirchner (under the name \\"L√©ar\\") directed the earliest surviving erotic film for Pirou. The 7-minute 1896 film Le Coucher de la Mariee had Louise Willy performing a bathroom striptease.Richard Abel, Encyclopedia of early cinema, Taylor & Francis, 2005, , p.518 Other French filmmakers also considered that profits could be made from this type of risqu√© films, showing women disrobing. Also in 1896 Fatima's Coochie-Coochie DanceProduced by James A. White and shot by William Heise for the Edison Manufacturing Co. in 1896. was released as a short kinetoscope film featuring a gyrating belly dancer named Fatima. Her gyrating and moving pelvis was censored, one of the earliest films to be censored. At the time, there were numerous risqu√© films that featured exotic dancers.Sex in Cinema: Pre-1920s In the same year, The May Irwin Kiss contained the very first kiss on film. It was a 20-second film loop, with a close-up of a nuzzling couple followed by a short peck on the lips (\\"the mysteries of the kiss revealed\\"). The kissing scene was denounced as shocking and pornographic to early moviegoers and caused the Roman Catholic Church to call for censorship and moral reform - because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution. A tableau vivant style is used in short film The Birth of the Pearl (1901)Produced by Frederick S. Armitage for the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company. featuring an unnamed long-haired young model wearing a flesh-colored body stocking in a direct frontal pose that provides a provocative view of the female body. The pose is in the style of Botticelli's The Birth of Venus. Because Pirou is nearly unknown as a pornographic filmmaker, credit is often given to other films for being the first. In Black and White and Blue (2008), one of the most scholarly attempts to document the origins of the clandestine 'stag film' trade, Dave Thompson recounts ample evidence that such an industry first had sprung up in the brothels of Buenos Aires and other South American cities by around the start of the 20th century, and then quickly spread through Central Europe over the following few years; however, none of these earliest pornographic films is known to survive. According to Patrick Robertson's Film Facts, \\"the earliest pornographic motion picture which can definitely be dated is A L'Ecu d'Or ou la bonne auberge\\" made in France in 1908; the plot depicts a weary soldier who has a tryst with a servant girl at an inn. The Argentinian El Satario might be even older; it has been dated to somewhere between 1907 and 1912. He also notes that \\"the oldest surviving pornographic films are contained in America's Kinsey Collection. One film demonstrates how early pornographic conventions were established. The German film Am Abend (1910) is \\"a ten-minute film which begins with a woman masturbating alone in her bedroom, and progresses to scenes of her with a man performing straight sex, fellatio and anal penetration.\\" In Austria, Johann Schwarzer formed his Saturn-Film production company which was able to produce 52 erotic productions between 1906 and 1911, when the company was dissolved by the censorship authorities and the films destroyed. Soon illegal stag films or blue films, as they were called, were produced underground by amateurs for many years starting in the 1940s. Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their bathtubs to wash the film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesman but being caught viewing or possessing them put one at the risk of prison. The post-war era saw developments that further stimulated the growth of a mass market. Technological developments, particularly the introduction of the 8mm and super-8 film gauges, resulted in the widespread use of amateur cinematography. Entrepreneurs emerged to supply this market. In the UK, the productions of Harrison Marks were \\"soft core\\", but considered risqu√© in the 1950s. On the continent, such films were more explicit. Lasse Braun was as a pioneer in quality colour productions that were, in the early days, distributed by making use of his father's diplomatic privileges. Pornography was first legalized in Denmark July 1969,Denmark in the International Encyclopedia of Sexuality - \\"...Denmark was the first country in the world to legitimize written pornography in 1967 (followed by pictorial pornography in 1969).\\" soon followed by the Netherlands the same year and Sweden in 1971, and this led to an explosion of commercially produced pornography in those countries, with the Color Climax Corporation quickly becoming the leading pornographic producer for the next couple of decades. Now that being a pornographer was a legitimate occupation, there was no shortage of businessmen to invest in proper plant and equipment capable of turning out a mass-produced, cheap, but quality product. Vast amounts of this new pornography, both magazines and films, were smuggled into other parts of Europe, where it was sold \\"under the counter\\" or (sometimes) shown in \\"members only\\" cinema clubs. The first explicitly pornographic film with a plot that received a general theatrical release in the U.S. is generally considered to be Mona the Virgin Nymph (also known as Mona), a 59-minute 1970 feature by Bill Osco and Howard Ziehm, who went on to create the relatively high-budget hardcore/softcore (depending on the release) cult film Flesh Gordon. The 1971 film Boys in the Sand represented a number of pornographic firsts. As the first generally available gay pornographic film, the film was the first to include on-screen credits for its cast and crew (albeit largely under pseudonyms), to parody the title of a mainstream film (in this case, The Boys in the Band), and to be reviewed by The New York Times. In 1972, pornographic films hit their public peak in the United States with both Deep Throat and Behind the Green Door being met with public approval and becoming social phenomena. The Devil in Miss Jones followed in 1973 and many predicted that frank depictions of sex onscreen would soon become commonplace, with William Rotsler saying in 1973, \\"Erotic films are here to stay. Eventually they will simply merge into the mainstream of motion pictures and disappear as a labeled sub-division. Nothing can stop this\\". In practice, a combination of factors put an end to big budget productions and the mainstreaming of pornography, and in many places it never got close - with Deep Throat not approved in its uncut form in the UK until 2000, and not shown publicly until June 2005. Video and digital depictions Digitally altered erotic photograph By 1982, most pornographic films were being shot on the cheaper and more convenient medium of videotape. Many film directors resisted this shift at first because of the different image quality that video tape produced; however, those who did change soon were collecting most of the industry's profits since consumers overwhelmingly preferred the new format. The technology change happened quickly and completely when directors realised that continuing to shoot on film was no longer a profitable option. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's private homes. This was the end of the age of big budget productions and the mainstreaming of pornography. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover every fetish possible since filming was now so inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands now were, including compilations of just the sex scenes from various videos. Erotic CD-ROMs were popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s because they brought an unprecedented element of interactiveness and fantasy. However, their poor quality was a drawback and when the Internet became common in households their sales declined. About the same time as the video revolution, the Internet became the preferred source of pornography for many people, offering both privacy in viewing and the chance to interact with people. The recent influx of widely available technology such as digital cameras, both moving and still, has blurred the lines between erotic films, photographs and amateur and professional productions. It allows easy access to both formats, making the production of them easily achieved by anyone with access to the equipment. Much of the pornography available today is produced by amateurs. Digital media is revolutionary in that it allows photographers and filmmakers to manipulate images in ways previously not possible, heightening the drama or eroticism of a depiction. High-definition video shows signs of changing the image of pornography as the technology is increasingly used for professional productions. The porn industry was one of the first to adopt the technology and it may have been a deciding factor in the format competition between HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc. Additionally, the clearer sharper images it provides have prompted performers to get cosmetic surgery and professional grooming to hide imperfections that are not visible on other video formats. Other adaptations have been different camera angles and techniques for close-ups and lighting.

Goytre United Football Club is a Welsh football club based in Goytre, near Port Talbot. They play in the Cymru South. Despite winning Division One of the Welsh Football League in 2005‚Äì06 and 2007‚Äì08 they were not promoted to the Welsh Premier League. Their home stadium is the Glenhafod Park Stadium. History In the spring of 1963 what funds the club had was handed to football secretary Boris Suhanski. Utilising these funds Goytre United Football Club was reborn. The Club were members of the Port Talbot and District Football League but were promoted to the South Wales Amateur League in the late sixties. After a successful opening spell things became more difficult and the Club was eventually relegated back into the Port Talbot League in the late seventies. In 1982 the Goytre United AFC Social Club opened its doors. A period of ten years passed when the club competed in the Port Talbot and District League, during this time the Club grew in stature on and off the field and in 1988 was re-elected back into the South Wales Amateur League. In the 1989‚Äì90 season the Club secured promotion into the First Division of the South Wales Amateur League. Also in this year a 350 all seating grandstand was built. In the 1990‚Äì91 season the club were promoted into the Welsh Football League and on 24 August 1991 played their first match against Milford United. Since elevation into the Welsh League steady improvements have been made both on and off the pitch and in 2000 floodlights were erected. In the 2003‚Äì2004 season the Club attained its highest position within the League when it ended the season in the runners up spot in division one and just missed out on promotion to the Welsh Premier League. In the 2004‚Äì05 season the club won the League Challenge Cup for the first time at Ton Pentre. Further history was made in the 2005‚Äì06 season when the club lifted the Welsh League First Division Championship, only losing three games. However, they have chosen to remain in the Welsh League First Division for the 2006‚Äì07 season. Normally, the top clubs from each of the two feeder leagues (the Welsh League First Division and the Cymru Alliance) are promoted subject to an application for membership of the Welsh Premier League being received and accepted and the stadium and infrastructure safety criteria of the League being met. Goytre United elected not to apply for promotion, and the First Division runners-up, Neath Athletic, failed to meet the stadium criteria and had their bid for promotion rejected. In the 2006‚Äì07 season, the reserve team won the Welsh League Reserve West Division for the first time in the club's history, guided by former team player/manager Paul Wiseman. In 2007‚Äì08 they won the Welsh Football League again, but once more they declined to apply for promotion to the Welsh Premier League. The following year the same situation occurred with Goytre winning the Welsh Football League for a third time, but were still denied promotion.

The squad entered the Port Talbot Reserve Division and claimed a respectable 8th-place finish in the league as well as a quarter final spot in the Port Talbot knockout cup. Notable acclaims for the season included beating champions Bay View 4‚Äì2 at the Glenhafod, Bayviews only defeat of the season. The 2011‚Äì12 season started off with big signings for the club in the form of Mikkel Mccalmon, Liam McGinley and Richard Phelps. With the new additions the reserve squad won not only the league but also the Port Talbot knockout cup beating local rivals Tata Steel 3‚Äì0 in the final. The 2012‚Äì13 season ended on 9 May with Goytre yet again doing the double with the league and cup. Goytre played Cornelly in the final with the scoreline at 5‚Äì2 to Goytre. The start of the 2013‚Äì14 season saw the Goytre Reserves promoted from the Port Talbot Reserve division to the Port Talbot & District Premier Division. Masked with the challenge of playing larger and more experienced teams Goytre made signings including center forward Liam Williams however the side lost key players such as Mikkel Mccalmon, Richard Phelps & Josh Beckingham to the Baglan Dragons. The season started slow for Goytre but the side got its usual rhythm back with the blossoming partnership of David \\"Bolt\\" Jones & Liam McGinley up top. The club finished in a highly respectable 3rd place in the new top flight division as well as narrowly missing out in the semi-finals of the Port Talbot Challenge cup to eventual winners Glyncorrwg FC. The 2014‚Äì15 season saw the return of previous players Mikkel Mccalmon, Richard Phelps & Josh Beckingham from the Baglan Dragons however saw the transfers of John Ashcroft and Rhys Harris to TATA Steel & the departure of goalkeeper Peter Watkins. Once again the team had a relatively slow start to the campaign managing only draws with bottom ranked side Fairfield Wednesday and Port Talbot Tigers however in Goytre fashion the season come down to the last few weeks with Goytre going unbeaten in their last 5 games to win the Port Talbot Premier Division Title for the first time. The league went neck and neck with last years runners up Glyncorrwg FC who after a loss to Goytre on the penultimate game of the season again went on to slip to another loss to Gwnfi United. This meant Goytre needed a win to secure the title which they completed with a 1‚Äì0 win against Croeserw Athletic. The sides run in the Port Talbot Challenge Cup came to an end in the second round after losing on penalties to Trefelin BGC First team after a 1‚Äì1 draw in 120 minutes despite playing a majority of the match with 10 men.

These priorities included support of the following: then-President George W. Bush and American troops in the war against terrorism; the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA); tax relief to families and the over two million Hispanic- and Portuguese-owned small businesses; support for faith based initiatives; and, educational choice for all.

He was a trader, shipowner, and banker, and served as a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts from 1851 to 1855, and again from 1861 to 1862. Early life Appleton was born in Brookfield, Massachusetts, the son of a minister, the Reverend Joseph Appleton, who died when he was nine.Robbins, Chandler (1863) Memoir of Hon. William Appleton He attended schools in New Ipswich, New Hampshire, Francestown, New Hampshire, and Tyngsborough, Massachusetts. At fifteen years of age he started work at a country store in Temple, New Hampshire. Three years later the owner took him into partnership, but a year after that he moved to Boston, Massachusetts. Career He worked for a store that bought and sold goods from the West Indies, and went into business for himself in 1807. In 1809, he bought a ship, and made several profitable trading voyages to Europe. After the War of 1812, he expanded his shipping business and became one of the wealthiest men in Boston. In 1818, Appleton purchased 50 shares of the Suffolk Bank, a clearinghouse bank on State Street in Boston. In 1826, he retired from business, but maintained a counting-house.Baker Library, Harvard Business School, Notes on William Appleton and Company records In 1832, he became president of the Boston branch of the Second Bank of the United States, and served until 1836. He was also at one time president of the Provident Institution for Savings. In 1841, he established William Appleton and Company in partnership with his son James and Samuel Hooper to conduct shipping and trading operations. They engaged in the California hide trade, and in commerce with China. He retired from the company in 1859. He was noted for benevolence toward public causes: he was president of Massachusetts General Hospital, to which he donated $30,000, and made other large donations. =Political career= In 1850, Appleton was elected U.S. Representative from Massachusetts's 1st district as a Whig. He was re-elected in 1852, this time from Massachusetts's 5th district, as districts had been redrawn after the 1850 Census. He was defeated for re-election in 1854, and lost again in 1856. In 1860, he was again elected Representative, as a Constitutional Unionist. He took his seat in 1861, but resigned in September, due to failing health. Appleton died five months after his resignation, on February 15, 1862, in Longwood, Massachusetts. He was interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The club has 3 senior teams, the Diamond Devils, Cannons, and Giants. All 3 teams train together and play their home games at Warriston Playing Fields near the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. The club refers to the field as Bobby Thomson Field in honour of the former major leaguer who was born in Scotland. The club also has a little league baseball programme which shares the same field. All teams are open to players of all abilities. The 3 senior teams all play in the Scotland National League. Since 2009 an Edinburgh team has won the league title each year. The reigning league champions are the Diamond Devils who have won the league title 4 consecutive seasons. Prior to this streak the Cannons won 3 consecutive league titles. History Baseball has been played in the Edinburgh area since the 1950s when it was played at United States Air Force bases at Kirknewton, then in Midlothian, and East Fortune in East Lothian, both just a few miles from the city. The Edinburgh Diamond Devils baseball club was formed in 1986 as the Edinburgh Royals. As one of the teams involved in the inaugural Scottish League, the Devils have enjoyed a long and rich history. League success came in 1991, two years after the 'Royals' became the 'Reivers' with the team claiming its first Scottish Championship. 1992 saw the team repeat as national champions, becoming the first team to do so in league history and saw the start of the club's first youth team, the Blue Jays. 1993 and 1994 were barren years for the team as Glasgow and Dundee emerged as national powers, however 1995 saw a significant change in team fortunes. Long-time General Manager Donald Brotchie retired from baseball and junior team head coach Nick Clark assumed the mantle of responsibility. A superb Reivers team was assembled which won the national title with an 11‚Äì1 record for the first time in three years. The team also won the Scottish Cup tournament. Double glory was secured when the Blue Jays won the first ever Scottish Junior League title with a 10‚Äì0 record. 1995 will forever be known as the year the organisation turned the corner and emerged as one of the biggest and best baseball clubs in Britain. 1996 saw the Reivers relinquish their title after a 6‚Äì6 season but 1997 and 1998 saw the team return to power with a back-to-back 11‚Äì1 seasons and another two titles. In 1999, as a result of the creation of a new Edinburgh rugby team called the Reivers, the club changed to the Edinburgh Diamond Devils and left the Scottish League to join the British Baseball League ‚Äì Division 1. This was a first for a Scottish team. Hard work paid off with a successful first foray into this league with the Devils gaining promotion to the top-flight of British baseball, the BBF Premier Division. In addition, the team became a major supporter of the Scotland National Team and 15 Devils were selected for an international match with England staged at Meadowbank Stadium, Edinburgh. Although defeated 11‚Äì13, Team Scotland enjoyed a tremendous occasion with almost 1,000 fans turning out to see the game. 1999 also saw the expansion of the team's youth programme to incorporate a four-team youth league within the city and a school development scheme called 'Pitch, Hit and Run' which provides baseball for children in 17 schools across the city. 2000 saw the Devils endure a tough first season of Premier League baseball but it ended with a glorious Team Scotland victory over England by a score of 18‚Äì5 in the annual international. Perhaps the most exciting development was the team's qualification for the June 2001 C.E.B. (Confederation of European Baseball) Cup of Cups tournament in Prague, the first time ever that a Scottish team has entered a European competition. This will be the most significant boost for Scottish baseball in its history... something that the Edinburgh Diamond Devils baseball organisation will take pride in doing. In 2007 the Diamond Devils won the Scottish National League with one of the best records in the history of the league, 15‚Äì1. In 2010 the Diamond Devils split into two teams, the second being the Edinburgh Canons, which went on to win the Scottish National League in their inaugural season. The team also moved to a new field in the centre of Edinburgh, near the Botanical Gardens. The two teams combined to make the Diamond Devils' first trip abroad to Europe in four years. They travelled to Norway and defeated the Kristiansand Suns 12‚Äì2 and Stavanger 17‚Äì3. In 2011 interest increased again with the Edinburgh Giants being added to the league. The Cannons won the league for the second year in a row. The second North Sea Cup was played in Edinburgh against the Kristiansand Suns. The Devils and Cannons both won with the Giants losing narrowly to the Suns on the final day. In 2012 the Cannons won the league title for the 3rd straight year. In 2013 the Diamond Devils won the league title for the first time since 2009 with a 13‚Äì2 record. This season marked the start of a dominating run the Diamond Devils as they went on to win the league title in 2014, 2015, and 2016. The Diamond Devils are the only team to win four consecutive titles in the current league. The 2016 team finished with a record of 13‚Äì3, which marks the highest number of losses in a season for the Diamond Devils since 2012. The Edinburgh teams all combined together to form a Scotland team for the annual Belfast baseball tournament in 2015 and 2016. In the 2015 tournament the combined team finished in 3rd place, which was the highest finish for a Scottish baseball team at a tournament abroad for more than 20 years. The Diamond Devils are the largest baseball club in Scotland with three adult teams and two junior teams. They play their home games at Bobby Thomson Field.

From the late 1950s to the early 1970s the islands were reshaped by development and efforts to control mosquitoes as the population of Brevard grew during the initial period of the space program at Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center. History The State of Florida bought the Thousand Islands in 1988. It leased them back to the City of Cocoa Beach in 1991, providing that the islands be used for recreation and conservational efforts. The total price was $3,230,950. The city contributed $1,615,475, Brevard County contributed $700,000, and the State of Florida contributed $915,475.North Thousand Islands Management Plan Geomorphology Sediment cores reveal that the Thousand Islands were formed when a storm-driven sea broke through the barrier island, leaving behind an approximately flood tide delta deposit. The date of this event is unknown. Charts from the mid 19th century and older do not depict the Thousand Islands. However, this might be due to lack of detail. The Cocoa Beach area was surveyed in 1876-1877 and appears identical to the 1951 aerial photographs. The stratigraphic characteristics of a flood tide delta deposit include the existence of a layer of plain sand (often containing terrestrial vegetation debris) sandwiched between sediments containing numerous small bivalve mollusc shells that are indicative of deposition in a normal lagoon environment. This uneven sand layer lacking shells suggests an interruption in the normal accretion of benthic sediments by a rapid deposition of dune material being washed in by severe wave action. There are about 100 islands in the Thousand Islands, The actual number of islands is meaningless due to the inundation of many areas during seasonal high water during summer. The relatively low topography and rising water levels can turn one island into many as rains begin. The Thousand Islands are divided roughly in half by the Minutemen Causeway. The formation comprises approximately of salt marsh, mangroves, spoil sites containing upland vegetation, and maritime hammocks on shell middens. Beginning in the late 1950s, small ditches were dug through the islands to allow water movement and fish access to inner areas of the succulent marsh for mosquito control. At approximately the same time, dredge and fill activities were begun in Cocoa Beach for housing development. Developers dredged canals and used the spoil to provide fill material for houses. Several areas of the Thousand Islands were filled but not fully developed, leaving large areas of uplands. During the late 1960s Brevard County Mosquito Control began dredging the Thousand Islands south of Minutemen Causeway, resulting in conversion of salt marsh to upland dredge spoil with the state-owned C-34 impoundment. Photograph of flooded ephemeral pond, prime breeding habitat for saltmarsh mosquitoes. Mosquito ditches. Effects on vegetation are minimal, simply allowing mangroves to colonize the ditch edges due to increased propagule dispersal. Mosquito canals and dikes. Wetland vegetation is nearly eliminated, reduced to a fringe of mangroves along island edges. Dredge spoil plant community. Flora Native wetlands are dominated by red, black, and white mangroves.C.F. Gaertn Succulent marsh contains saltwort, annual glasswort, perennial glasswort,(Mill.) A. J. Scott sea blight,Elliott) Moq. and shoreline seapurslane. The transition zone between salt marsh and upland is dominated by bushy seaside oxeye (Borrichia frutescens (L.) DC.) and buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus L.). Transition areas dominated by graminoid vegetation contain saltgrass (Distichlis spicata (L.) Greene) and seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum Sw.). Uplands have been colonized by several native plant species, including Florida swamp privet (Forestiera segregata (Jacq.) Krug & Urb.), salt bush (Baccharis halimifolia L.), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto (Walter) Lodd. ex Shult. & Schult. f.), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera L.), and strangler fig (Ficus aurea Nutt.). Principal invasive non-native plants include Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi), Australian pines (Casuarina equisetifolia L., Casuarina glauca Sieber ex Spreng.), and carrotwood (Cupaniopsis anacardioides (A. Rich.) Radlk.). All are Category I invasives, \\"...altering native plant communities by displacing native species, changing community structures or ecological functions...\\" Pre-Columbian shell middens are present in four main areas of the Thousand Islands. Acquisition, Restoration The state of Florida and Cocoa Beach purchased the islands north of Minutemen Causeway in 1988. Acquisition of the remaining south islands was completed by 2007. These islands are managed as the Thousand Islands Conservation Area by Brevard County Environmentally Endangered Lands Program. Efforts to acquire the remaining privately held islands began in 2006 with acquisition of the Reynolds tract, and were completed in 2007 with acquisition of the Crawford Homes tract by the Brevard County Environmentally Endangered Lands Program (EEL). Restoration efforts involve removal of Brazilian pepper and Australian pine. Despite the Category I status of Australian pine, removal of trees in ecological restoration can be controversial among the lay public. In the EEL-managed Thousand Islands Conservation Area, replanting has been used following removal of Australian pine, but the effects are modest, with native recruitment out-pacing planted species. The management plan for the north Thousand Islands is currently (April 2013) under revision. References External references Plant nomenclature follows Wunderlin, R. P. & B. F. Hansen. (2011).

Background  Over the years the Temple has grown in its knowledge of Voodoo in relation with World Religions, and serves many people throughout America and the World. The Temple follows a unique version of Voodoo that combines elements of other spiritual paths with traditional practices. It has become known through television and movie production, and is visited by representatives of universities, anthropologists, and researchers in African- based religion.

As a disciple of the Kelm Talmud Torah method, he was known for his strict keeping of order and strong self- control. It is told that he would not turn his head without a reason and a structured decision.  Biography  Reb Elya Lopian was born in Grajewo, Poland in 1876. In his youth he studied at the yeshiva in ≈Åom≈ºa and at the Kelm Talmud Torah of Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv. He emigrated to England in 1928, where he served as the rosh yeshiva of the Etz Chaim Yeshiva in the East End of London, working for many years alongside his distinguished colleague Rabbi Nachman Shlomo Greenspan. His wife Soroh Leah Rotman died in 1934, shortly after the engagement of their daughter Leiba to Rabbi Leib Gurwicz. For many years, Rabbi Lopian had wanted to make his home in the Land of Israel, and spoke a great deal about the Vilna Gaon's intense yet unfulfilled desire to live there. In 1950 he left the Etz Chaim Yeshiva and moved to Israel. At first he stayed in the home of his wife's brother, Yisrael Luria, in Jerusalem. That Sukkot, he visited the Brisker Rov, Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik. He initially refused to lead mussar seminars in Israel and sought to occupy himself with teaching and private moral work. Yet with the blessing of Rabbi Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz (the Chazon Ish), he finally reconciled himself with leading mussar courses. Despite his old age, he agreed in the end to act as Mashgiach Ruchani at the Knesses Chizkiyahu yeshiva located originally in Zikhron Ya'akov and later in Kfar Hasidim), headed by Rabbi Noah Shimonowitz. From the moment of his arrival, Reb Elya became a magnet for the young men. The yeshiva became firmly established and even drew many young people from neighboring yeshiva high schools such as the Bnei Akiva Kfar HaRo'eh yeshivah and Midrashiat Noam in Pardes Hannah. Reb Elya died in Israel on 21 September 1970 and was buried in the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery. Reb Elya Lopian had 13 children: * Rabbi Simcha Zissel Lopian of Yeshivat Toras Emes, London; * Rabbi Avraham Yeshaya Lopian, United States; * Rebbetzin Leiba Gurwicz, (wife of Rabbi Leib Gurwicz); * Rabbi Chaim Shmuel Lopian of Sunderland Yeshiva; * Rabbi Leib Lopian of Gateshead Yeshiva; * Rabbi Eliezer Lopian of Yeshivat Toras Emes, London; * Rebbetzin Pearl Klien, London and Jerusalem; * Rabbi Benzion (Benzel) Lapian, Willesden (London), Edgware (London) and Hong Kong; * Rabbi Zvi Hershel Lopian (perished in the Holocaust); * Rebbetzin Rochel Vilenski, Jerusalem; * Yisroel Nochum Lopian, London; * Rebbetzin Chaya Pinski, Jerusalem; * Yankel Yoel Lopian, Manchester After his death, a street was named in his honor in the Ramat Shlomo neighborhood of Jerusalem.

This is illustrated from a quote by Sir Francis Bacon in his 1658 publication New Atlantis: \\"Wee have also diverse Mechanicall Arts, which you have not; And Stuffes made by them; As Papers, Linnen, Silks, Tissues; dainty Works of Feathers of wonderfull Lustre; excellent Dies, and many others.\\"stuff, n.1, OED Second edition, 1989; online version September 2011. In Coventry, those completing seven-year apprenticeships with stuff merchants were entitled to become freemen of the city.Adrian Room, 'Cash, John (1822‚Äì1880)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 One type of stuff was a type of coarse thickly woven cloth manufactured in various places, formerly including Kidderminster. Originally it was probably entirely of wool, but later a 'woolsey-linsey' cloth, made with a warp of linen, yarn and a worsted weft. The gowns of most English lawyers are still described as 'stuff gowns' (though probably now made of other fibres). This is in contrast with those of Queen's Counsel, which are made of silk, whence they are termed 'silks'. Thus, 'stuff' in this context refers to fabric not made of silk or silk substitutes. The word was still in English upper-class usage in this sense in the 1960s. In Victorian dressmaking terminology, stuff was used as a generic term for woven fabrics, with cloth generally reserved for woollens (as opposed to worsteds). Kidderminster Manufacture of Kidderminster stuff was established by the mid-17th century, when it was referred to by Richard Baxter, the puritan divine, who was lecturer in the parish church of Kidderminster from 1641, and then vicar in the 1650s. The cloth was used for wall hangings and furniture fabrics.N. Gilbert, A History of Kidderminster (Phillimore, Chichester 2004), 35-43. In 1671, an Act of Parliament was obtained for preventing 'abuses and deceits in making Kidderminster stuffs'. This directed that the master weavers should yearly elect a President, four Wardens and eight Assistants to make byelaws for the trade. This body was responsible for regulating all cloth manufacture in the parish, whether with wool only or with wool and other materials. The Act specifically mentions linen yarn being 'reeled on a reel four yards about' and sold by the 'lea' containing 200 threads.J. R. Burton, A History of Kidderminster (1890), 176-80. In the early 18th century, the range of textiles made in Kidderminster broadened with bombazine (with a silk warp and worsted weft) also being produced. The traditional stuff trade declined in the late 18th century with the rise of cotton fabrics. However Kidderminster continued to be a textile town, but in the 19th and 20th centuries specialised in carpets. The olden stuff trade was essentially extinct by 1815.Gilbert, 55-6 59-60 66-70 77 Elsewhere Norwich, Darlington, and the West Riding of Yorkshire were also English centres for the manufacture of worsted textiles, including stuffs.John James, History of the Worsted Manufacture in England (1857), passim.

Early life Numeroff was born in Brooklyn, New York, and is the youngest of three girls. As a child, Numeroff was an avid reader, and by the age of 9 had decided she wanted to be a writer when she grew up. She credits her current profession to two specific childhood favorites, claiming that they \\"are the reason\\" she is a writer: E. B. White's Stuart Little and Kay Thompson's Eloise. When it came time for Numeroff to apply for college, she decided not to become a writer. Instead, she followed her sister's footsteps and majored in fashion. Eventually though, Numeroff decided that fashion \\"wasn't for me\\", so she went back to her childhood dream of becoming a writer, and began taking a class on writing. A homework assignment for one of these classes prompted Numeroff to write the story Amy for Short. In 1975 the story was published by Macmillan Publishing, launching Laura Joffe Numeroff's writing career. Career Numeroff has worked with numerous illustrators including Lynn Munsinger, David McPhail, Tim Bowers, Nate Evans, Joe Mathieu, Sal Murdocca, Sharleen Collicott, and Felicia Bond; Felicia Bond is the illustrator of the If You Give . . . series. When Numeroff began her career she served as her own illustrator; her first 9 books were both written and illustrated by Numeroff herself. Since her editor chose Felicia Bond to illustrate Numeroff's If You Give a Mouse a Cookie book, she has not illustrated another book. When asked about her earlier endeavors into illustrations during an interview, she mentioned that though she loves drawing, she decided her \\"strength was in writing and not in illustration\\" and said \\"I don't think I would illustrate a whole book anymore at this point\\". Her autobiography, If You Give an Author a Pencil, was published in 2003; it is written at a second grade reading level so that it is also accessible to children. Numeroff's books have been published in many languages. Numeroff resides in Los Angeles, California. =Series= If You Give... If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, published in 1985 and illustrated by Felicia Bond, was the book that launched the hit If You Give... series. It was rejected by publishers nine times before it was finally accepted by Harper. These stories use a circular story format, presenting to the reader a chain of events. At the end of the story, the reader discovers that the characters have ended up in the same event that they started with. It is also considered a cautionary tale where the moral is that when given something out of kindness, people will continue to ask for more. The entire story is an \\"If ____________ , then ___________\\" scenario . If You Give a Mouse a Cookie spawned numerous more books that expanded from the mouse to include the characters of a moose, a cat, a pig, and a dog. What...Do Best The first book in this series by Numeroff, What Mommies Do Best/ What Daddies Do Best, published in April 2008, was illustrated, in watercolors, by Lynn Munsinger. The entire series was written for children ages 4 ‚Äì 8. This children's book is a two part story. On one side of the book is What Mommies Do Best. This book demonstrates many of the great things that mommies do like: give piggyback rides, teach children how to ride a bicycle, and sew a button on a teddy bear. Following What Mommies Do Best, the book can be flipped to reveal What Daddies Do Best. This side illustrates all the special things that daddy does with his children. The stories are identical. Both mommy and daddy do the same things in each book. Subsequent books concern grandparents and aunts and uncles. What Mommies Do Best/ What Daddies Do Best uses different animals in brightly colored illustrations to show young children the things parents do that make them so special. Each illustration shows a different animal parent with their young child. The Jellybeans Bitsy, a pig wearing purple, loves to draw, color, paint and make art. Emily, a dog wearing pink, loves to dance. Anna, a rabbit wearing yellow, loves to read books. Nicole, a cat wearing blue, loves to play soccer. The first letters of their names spell the word \\"BEAN\\". That is because they love jellybeans. Their favorite place is a candy store called Petunia's, where they love to share jellybeans. Just as jellybeans are different flavors but go well together, the girls are all different but get along great ‚Äì and so they call themselves the JELLYBEANS. =Other works= In 2016, Numeroff and co-creator Sean Hanrahan released Raising a Hero. The illustrated children's book about a young boy raising a puppy to become a service dog and help children with disabilities supports Canine Companions for Independence. An avid animal lover, Laura has always wanted to write a book about service dogs. Laura Numeroff's Ten Step Guide to Living with Your Monster, illustrated by Nate Evans, was published in April 2002 for children ages 4 ‚Äì 8. This book gives kids a different idea about monsters. Instead of being afraid of them this story shows you how to make a monster a good pet. This guide outlines Numeroff's ten basic steps to buying, naming, and dealing with your pet monster. There are things you should know like choosing a monster that can tie its shoes, how to take your monster to the vet, not to choose a monster who tries to eat your shirt, and that \\"Fluffy\\" is not a good name for a monster. With each step is a bright, colorful illustration to help you choose your own pet monster. A portion of the profits from Laura Numeroff's Ten Step Guide to Living with Your Monster were donated to The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. Phoebe Dexter Has Harriet Peterson's Sniffles, published in January 1977, tells the woeful tale of Phoebe Dexter who is stuck at home because she is sick. Upset that she is missing all the happenings of her school day, Phoebe busies herself pretending she is a dog and eventually playing Go Fish with her grandmother who comes over to keep her company. The book is both written and illustrated by Numeroff.

The background With the arrival of the Bourbons on the throne of Spain in 1801 came a period of Indio Mariano, one of them serious, led by different men. The first of these took place in Tepic, Nueva Galicia in January. The second occurred in September in Nuevo Le√≥n. The first rebellion Juan Hilario Rubio, an important man of Tepic, Alcalde Jos√© Desiderio Maldonado, and the Indigenous clerk Juan Francisco Medina were the leaders of the first Indio Mariano rebellion. These men circulated a proclamation for the crowning of a native of Tlaxcala as Rey de Indias Mariano Primero (Mariano I, king of the Indies). This was scheduled for January 6, 1801. Even before that date, some pueblos were in open rebellion against the Spanish. The coronation, however, was frustrated. The Spanish officials were able to assemble a force of 762 men and 8 pieces of artillery, relying largely on the local militia and the fleet in the harbor at San Blas. For the place and time, this was an overwhelming force. The three leaders and many other persons were taken prisoner. Many prisoners were taken in two \\"battles\\", one on January 5 and one that day or shortly thereafter. The Indigenous offered little resistance and casualties were minimal. The rebellion seemed to be over by January 8, but the following week a second wave appeared. The Spanish forces suffered setbacks. Large groups of armed Indians were seen in many places, converging on Tepic. The Spanish were forced to withdraw from various villages. They too converged on Tepic. Alarming rumors began to circulate -- that 5,000 Yaquis were approaching; that 6,000 to 7,000 Yumas were coming from the Colorado River. The rebellion and the rumors greatly alarmed viceregal officials in Mexico City, particularly since the mother country, and therefore also the colony, was at war with Great Britain. They began to fear the possibility of a general Indian uprising, perhaps simultaneously with a British invasion. The fears were relieved the following week. Reports came in contradicting the rumors of massive movements of warriors. Other reports arrived telling of Indians returning peacefully to their villages. On January 19, Captain Leonardo Pintado dispersed a group of armed rebels, taking 33 prisoners. The emergency came to an end. The Spanish had taken approximately 300 prisoners. Most of those arrested were sent to Guadalajara. However, some died in jail in Tepic of an unknown disease, some on the march to Guadalajara, and some after arriving in Guadalajara. Some of the Spanish troops also suffered from the disease, and some of them died. Juan Hilario Rubio was one of the rebels who died in Guadalajara. He was condemned postmortem to confiscation of his property, demolition of his house, and sowing of his fields with salt. The two other leaders were condemned to six years of public labor in Veracruz. This was a sentence that often proved fatal. Most of the other surviving prisoners were released. Indio Mariano (also known as M√°scara de Oro, or Golden Mask) was never crowned. He was apparently a young Indian itinerant beggar who showed up in Tepic shortly before Christmas 1800 in the company of an old mulatto and a child. He claimed to be the son of a deceased governor of Tlaxcala, and to have grown up in luxury. It may not have been true that Indio Mariano was a native of Tlaxcala in a literal sense. For the Indian resistance of the time, claiming a relationship to Tlaxcala was asserting a claim to the special rights granted the Indigenous of that place by Hern√°n Cort√©s at the time of the Conquest. Indio Mariano was never found. However, rights and titles claimed in connection with Tlaxcalla persisted up until the time of the first Mexican Empire and may have even played a significant role in motivating some natives to side with the conservative forces during the French Intervention. There has been speculation that the \\"Promise of Tlaxcalla\\" may have played a part in the Cristero Rebellion, due in part to the belief that the catholic rebels were awaiting pontifical approval before crowning an official \\"Prince of Tlaxcalla\\" as heir to a \\"Kingdom of the Aztecs\\" in fulfillment of the Tlaxcalla Compact. One has to believe that the Tlaxcalla Compact may have given rise to the chicano legend of the return of the Quetzalcuatl to unify a broken Aztlan. Quetzalcuatl is the chief deity of the allied Aztec tribes who unified themselves under Tlaxcalla and the Spanish, when they liberated Cholula from Mexican control, leading up to the conquest of Tenochtitlan. The second \\"rebellion\\" On September 1, 1801 in Nuevo Le√≥n, an Indian by the name of Juan Jos√© Garc√≠a was apprehended stealing cattle. He told the authorities he was Mariano I or Alejandro I. These were names of kings. Mariano asserted that his royal birth and ancestry were documented by papal certificates that he had personally obtained in Rome. His case was transferred to the royal medical tribunal, where he was diagnosed as mentally ill with melancholia. He was ordered to the hospital of San Hip√≥lito for treatment.

Outright pictures are avoided in Islam but tessellations and calligraphic pictures were allowed, so designed \\"accidental\\" silhouettes of carved stone tesellations around the entrance (muqarnas) became a creative escape. This is probably an early example of artful sciography using pareidolia. The interior of the mosque consists of stone piers which support the stone vaults above. The central bay of the mosque appears to have been left open to the sky, as is the case in other medieval Anatolian mosques which omit courtyards. Some of the original wooden furnishings of the mosque survive along its qibla wall, such as the shutters on the window opening to the tomb chamber within the hospital and its wooden minbar dated to 1243 and signed by the craftsman Ibrahƒ´m b. Ahmad al-Tiflƒ´sƒ´. Some carved wooden panels said to belong to the royal platform are today on view in the museum of the Directorate of Pious Endowments in Ankara.Oya Pancaroƒülu, \\"The Mosque-Hospital Complex in Divriƒüi: A History of Relations and Transitions.\\" Anadolu ve √áevresinde Orta√ßaƒü 3 (2009). The hospital is entered through its portal located on the western fa√ßade. Different in design from the north portal of the mosque, the hospital portal is framed by a monumental pointed arch and features a window in the center. The stone carving here is of the same quality as the main mosque portal but is less dense and appears, in certain places, to be unfinished. The interior of the hospital consists of rooms and iwans placed around a covered courtyard with a small pool in the center. The hospital has a second story on its southern side which is reached by a staircase just inside the entrance. One of the rooms of the hospital was dedicated to serve as a dynastic tomb chamber. This room has a window opening to the mosque.Oya Pancaroƒülu, \\"The Mosque-Hospital Complex in Divriƒüi: A History of Relations and Transitions.\\" Anadolu ve √áevresinde Orta√ßaƒü 3 (2009). The name of the chief architect is inscribed in the interior of both the mosque and the hospital and has been read as KhurramshƒÅh b. Mughƒ´th al-KhilƒÅtƒ´. The name indicates his origin in the city of Ahlat, known in the medieval sources as al-KhilƒÅt.Oya Pancaroƒülu, \\"The Mosque-Hospital Complex in Divriƒüi: A History of Relations and Transitions.\\" Anadolu ve √áevresinde Orta√ßaƒü 3 (2009). The exquisite carvings and architecture of both buildings place them among the most important works of architecture in Anatolia and led to their inclusion on UNESCO's World Heritage List in 1985. Patronage The north portal of the mosque gives the date of 626 AH (1228-9) and the name of its patron as AhmadshƒÅh b. SulaymƒÅn, who is one of the rulers of the Divriƒüi branch of the Mengujekids.Oya Pancaroƒülu, \\"The Mosque-Hospital Complex in Divriƒüi: A History of Relations and Transitions.\\" Anadolu ve √áevresinde Orta√ßaƒü 3 (2009). The inscription on the portal of the hospital describes the building as a dƒÅr al- shifƒÅ' (\\"house of healing\\") and ascribes its foundation to T≈´rƒÅn Malik bint (\\"daughter of\\") Fakhr al-Dƒ´n BahramshƒÅh. Fakhr al-Dƒ´n BahramshƒÅh is the best known Mengujekid ruler whose reign, in Erzincan, lasted for nearly sixty years until his death in 1225. Although it is often assumed that AhmadshƒÅh and T≈´rƒÅn Malik were married, there actually is no evidence, inscriptional or otherwise, to prove a matrimonial relationship between these two members of the extended Mengujekid royal family.Oya Pancaroƒülu, \\"The Mosque-Hospital Complex in Divriƒüi: A History of Relations and Transitions.\\" Anadolu ve √áevresinde Orta√ßaƒü 3 (2009).

The Zhonghua Da Zidian () is an unabridged Chinese dictionary of characters, originally published in 1915 by the Zhonghua Book Company in Shanghai. The chief editors were Xu Yuan'gao (ÂæêÂÖÉË™•), Lufei Kui (ÈôÜË¥πÈÄµ), and Ouyang Pucun (Ê≠êÈôΩÊ∫•Â≠ò/Ê¨ßÈò≥Ê∫•Â≠ò). It was based upon the 1716 Kangxi Zidian, and is internally organized using the 214 Kangxi radicals. The 1915 publication contains more than 48,000 entries for individual characters, including many invented in the two centuries since the Kangxi Dictionary, making it the largest character dictionary of its time. Each character entry includes the fanqie spelling from the Jiyun, the modern pronunciation given with a common homophone, different meanings, classical quotations, and two-character compounds using the character. One strength of the Zhonghua dictionary is its clear presentation of definitions. Separate definitions are numbered, instead of being run together in a column as was the case with earlier Chinese dictionaries, which is helpful to users because some characters have as many as 40 separate definitions (Creamer 1992: 118). Although Teng and Biggerstaff (1971:131) acknowledged that the Zhonghua Da Zidian \\"is very comprehensive and is very carefully compiled,\\" they noted three defects. The index, which is arranged by number of strokes, can be inconvenient (e.g., 2189 characters are listed under 9 strokes). The margins do not have characters to help locate entries under a radical. The two- character phrases may be listed under either component.

(May 22, 1946 ‚Äì August 18, 2006) was a physician who became infamous for giving steroids to the sprinter Ben Johnson. Dr. Astaphan was born on the island of St. Kitts in the West Indies. He attended universities in Canada, where he received a BSc degree from Sir George Williams University (1967) in Montreal, and then graduated from the University of Toronto's Faculty of Medicine in 1971. He practiced medicine in various places in Ontario, Canada: Warkworth, Campbellford, Scarborough, North York, and Toronto. In 1988 he was accused of administering the stanozolol which led Ben Johnson to lose his 100m Gold Medal. These allegations were never proven and Dr. Astaphan denied them for the next 18 years. As a result of the Dubin Inquiry, he was fined by the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons in June 1991 and banned from practicing medicine in the province for 18 months. In 1994, after the plane he was flying on was diverted to New York City, he was charged for conspiracy to distribute steroids, conspiracy to acquire cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. After nearly two years in a Florida prison without a trial, he was released with \\"time served\\" on the steroid charges but the Government had no case on the cocaine charges. After his release in late 1995, Astaphan returned to his native St. Kitts and Nevis where he continued to practice medicine until his death. He died in 2006 of a heart attack at home in St. Kitts. He is survived by his three children.

(2010). When Doctors Kill: Who, Why, and How. Copernicus Books. pp. 33-35. was an American quack, fraud, swindler and serial killer noted for her promotion of fasting as a treatment. She was imprisoned by the state of Washington for a number of deaths at a sanitarium she operated there in the early 20th century. Her treatments were responsible for at least 15 deaths. Born 1867 in Carver County, Minnesota, she died during a fast in 1938. Career Hazzard was born Lynda Laura Burfield in Carver, Minnesota, one of eight children born to Montgomery and Susanna Neil (Wakefield) Burfield. She had no medical degree, but was licensed to practice medicine in Washington State through a loophole that grandfathered in some practitioners of alternative medicine without degrees. According to her book The Science of Fasting, she studied under Edward Hooker Dewey, M.D., a champion of fasting. She created a \\"sanitarium\\", Wilderness Heights, in Olalla, Washington, where inpatients fasted for days, weeks, or months on a diet of small amounts of tomato and asparagus juice and occasionally a small teaspoon of orange juice. While some patients survived and publicly sang her praises, dozens died under her care. Hazzard claimed that they all died of undisclosed or hitherto undiagnosed illnesses such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver. Her opponents claimed that they all died of starvation. Local residents referred to the place as \\"Starvation Heights\\". She assured people that her method was a panacea for all manner of ills, because she was able to rid the body of toxins that caused imbalances in the body.Holmes, Ronald M., and Stephen T. Holmes. Serial Murder. Third Edition ed. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, Inc, 2009 During her medical career, Hazzard wrote two books about what she claimed to be the science behind fasting and how it could cure diseases. The first book she wrote was \\"Fasting for the Cure of Disease\\" (1908). Her second book was \\"Scientific Fasting: the Ancient and Modern Key to Health\\" (1927). In 1912, she was convicted of manslaughter for the death of Claire Williamson, a wealthy British woman, who weighed less than 50 pounds at the time of her death. At the trial it was proven that Hazzard had forged Williamson's will and stolen most of her valuables. Williamson's sister, Dorothea, also took the treatment, and, it is alleged, only survived because a family friend showed up in time to remove her from the compound. It is suggested that one of them managed to smuggle a telegram to alert the family; however, by the time of arrival, Claire had already died. Dorothea was too weak to leave on her own, weighing less than 60 pounds. She later testified against Hazzard at trial. Hazzard was sentenced to 2 to 20 years in prison, which she served in the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla. She was released on parole on December 26, 1915, after serving two years, and the following year Governor Ernest Lister gave her a full pardon. She and her husband, Samuel Chrisman Hazzard (1869‚Äì1946), moved to New Zealand, where she practiced as a dietitian and osteopath until 1920. In 1917, a New Zealand newspaper from Whanganui reported that she held a practicing certificate from the Medical Board of the state of Washington.Personal, Wanganui Chronicle, Volume LX, Issue 17037, July 16, 1917, Page 4 Because she used the title \\"Doctor\\" she was charged in Auckland under the Medical Practitioners Act for practicing medicine while not registered to do so, found guilty and fined ¬£5 plus costsUnregistered physician, New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16877, June 15, 1918, Page 8 (approximately NZ$600 plus costs or US$462.13 plus costs in 2014). In 1920, she returned to Olalla, Washington, and opened a new sanitarium, known publicly as a \\"school of health\\" since her medical license had been revoked, and continued to supervise fasts until it burned to the ground in 1935; it was never rebuilt. Hazzard died of starvation in 1938 while attempting a fasting cure. Earl Edward Erdman Diary On March 28, 1910, Earl Edward Erdman, a City of Seattle Civil Engineer, died of starvation in the Seattle General Hospital. He had kept a diary which detailed Hazzard's treatment during the preceding weeks that provides an insight into the treatment Hazzard prescribed to her patients.

He was a right-handed batsman and a left-arm medium-fast bowler. He was born in Hucknall Torkard and died in Leigh, Lancashire. Wright's began playing county cricket in the 1879 season, representing Nottinghamshire for the first seven years of his career, having played his first professional game at the age of seventeen for the Notts Bank club, having been a creditable sprinter during his youth, as well as a football trainer. Wright made his first-class debut against Lancashire, scoring a duck in his first innings, but bowling economically, conceding just twelve runs from five overs. He played four further matches during the 1879 season, his final game coming against Gloucestershire in which he scored a first-innings duck. Wright waited over nine months until his next first-class fixture, and between the following two, over a year, as he played for Gentlemen of Canada for the entirety of the 1880 season. When he returned for the team, having attended several games for Gentlemen of Canada, he immediately hit a poor patch of form, he continued in the lower-order for the rest of the year. The English summer of 1882 saw an Australian tour of England, climaxing in a single Test in August, in which Wright played a single game, though he was immediately dropped to the tailend after this fixture, under pressure from an improving Alfred Shaw, the team's captain for four seasons as of 1883. However, this pressure spurred Wright to improve his stamina over the long game, and he appeared for the first time as a permanent fixture in the Nottinghamshire team, as well as playing in several special fixtures, including one for a WG Grace XI and one for North vs. South of England. The following year saw another tour by Australia, in which, after a stream of good form, Wright once again played. While 1886 saw further good form from Wright which saw him play in an England XI against Australia, this was to prove his final fixture for nearly two years. He had taken 193 wickets bowling for Nottinghamshire in county matches. By the time of his return, in June 1888, Wright had moved to Kent, where, within his first month at the club, he was already being selected once again for North vs. South of England matches, as well as various Gentlemen vs. Players and selected elevens. Come 1890, the inaugural season of the newly formed County Championship, Wright was once again a fixture as a bowler, supported by Test cricketer Fred Martin. A steady performer in the first league season, Kent finished in equal-third position in the table, while Wright was one of only five Kent players who played in all fourteen games of the season, managing also to play all but one game in 1891, and again in 1892. While his season-best scores were steadily declining season by season from his career-best century-score of the 1883 season, this form would come back in 1892, when he scored two half-centuries, his first for eight years. This good form for Wright would not show for the rest of the county, as they only managed to pick up two victories in the entire season, finishing second from bottom in the championship. Things were looking up, however, as for the first time since the inaugural season, Kent finished with a positive points total, and Wright with 300 runs to show for the season and a half-century to his credit. Kent had vastly improved come 1894, under the captaincy of Frank Marchant. 1895 was a poor season, Kent finishing bottom of the league, however, hope was not lost as fresh blood was pumped into the side, in the form of Bill Bradley and Fred Huish, and, the following season, improvements were seen in the consistency of both club and player, Wright and Martin forming, on various occasions, a successful bowling partnership. As Martin improved and moved up the order, his positioning in the lineup would be sacrificed to the blooming Fred Huish, in only his second season in the team. 1896 and 1897 saw Kent struggle with form as they had in 1895, in spite of Wright's significant improvement in deep field. While in 1897 and 1898 Wright would once again in most County Championship games, his speed in the field and at the crease had decreased with his advancing age, and the following year, he would quit the first-class game. He had taken 696 wickets bowling for Kent in 11 seasons. WG Grace's held the opinion of Wright is that he believed him to be at the forefront of the creation and proliferation of swing bowling, a formidable prospect at his speed of movement, Wright being believed to be the second-fastest runner in the world in his prime sprinting days. Following his exit from playing, Wright became a first-class umpire, taking charge of 97 matches between 1900 and 1904 and one further game 20 years later. With decent knowledge and a love of football, Wright acted as a trainer to several football clubs, coaching Reading.

Swedish captive balloon carrier in 1907 A balloon carrier or balloon tender was a ship equipped with a balloon, usually tied to the ship by a rope or cable, and usually used for observation. During the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century, these ships were built to have the furthest possible view of the surrounding waters. After several experiments, the type became formalized in the early 1900s, but was soon to be superseded by the development of seaplane carriers and regular aircraft carriers at the beginning of World War I.  Early history  In 1849 the Austrian Navy ship took part in the first aggressive use of balloons in warfare, serving as a balloon carrier (the precursor to the aircraft carrier) in the first offensive use of air power in naval aviation. Austrian forces besieging Venice attempted to float some 200 paper hot air balloons, each carrying a 24- to 30-pound bomb that was to be dropped from the balloon with a time fuse over the besieged city. The balloons were launched mainly from land; however, some were also launched from Vulcano. The Austrians used smaller pilot balloons to determine the correct fuse settings. At least one bomb fell in the city; however, due to the wind changing after launch, most of the balloons missed their target, and some drifted back over Austrian lines and the launching ship Vulcano.Mikesh, Robert C. \\"Japan's World War II balloon bomb attacks on North America.\\" (1973). Later, during the American Civil War, about the time of the Peninsula Campaign, gas-filled balloons were being used to perform reconnaissance on Confederate positions. The battles turned inland into the heavily forested areas of the Virginia Peninsula where balloons could not travel. A coal barge, the George Washington Parke Custis, was cleared of all deck rigging to accommodate the gas generators and apparatus of balloons. From this ship, professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe, Chief Aeronaut of the Union Army Balloon Corps, made his first ascents over the Potomac River and telegraphed claims of his successful aerial venture. Other barges were converted to assist with the other military balloons transported about the eastern waterways. None of these Civil War craft ever sailed on the high seas. A Confederate balloon carrier, the CSS Teaser, was in service from 1861 to 1862 before being captured by the Union Navy.  Types  Balloons launched from ships led to the formal development of balloon carriers, or balloon tenders, during World War I, by the navies of Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Sweden. About 10 such balloon tenders were built with their main objective being aerial observation posts. These ships were either decommissioned or converted to seaplane tenders after the War.

It expresses the value of some function F defined on the classical Wiener space of continuous paths starting at the origin as the sum of its mean value and an It√¥ integral with respect to that path. It is named after the contributions of mathematicians J.M.C. Clark (1970), Daniel Ocone (1984) and U.G. Haussmann (1978). Statement of the theorem Let C0([0, T]; R) (or simply C0 for short) be classical Wiener space with Wiener measure Œ≥. Let F : C0 ‚Üí R be a BC1 function, i.e. F is bounded and Fr√©chet differentiable with bounded derivative DF : C0 ‚Üí Lin(C0; R).

More generally, the conclusion holds for any F in L2(C0; R) that is differentiable in the sense of Malliavin. Integration by parts on Wiener space The Clark‚ÄìOcone theorem gives rise to an integration by parts formula on classical Wiener space, and to write It√¥ integrals as divergences: Let B be a standard Brownian motion, and let L02,1 be the Cameron‚ÄìMartin space for C0 (see abstract Wiener space. Let V : C0 ‚Üí L02,1 be a vector field such that :\\\\dot{V} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial t} : [0, T] \\\\times C_{0} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} is in L2(B) (i.e. is It≈ç integrable, and hence is an adapted process). Let F : C0 ‚Üí R be BC1 as above. Then :\\\\int_{C_{0}} \\\\mathrm{D} F (\\\\sigma) (V(\\\\sigma)) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\gamma (\\\\sigma) = \\\\int_{C_{0}} F (\\\\sigma) \\\\left( \\\\int_{0}^{T} \\\\dot{V}_{t} (\\\\sigma) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\sigma_{t} \\\\right) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\gamma (\\\\sigma), i.e. :\\\\int_{C_{0}} \\\\left\\\\langle abla_{H} F (\\\\sigma), V (\\\\sigma) \\\\right\\\\rangle_{L_{0}^{2, 1}} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\gamma (\\\\sigma) = - \\\\int_{C_{0}} F (\\\\sigma) \\\\operatorname{div}(V) (\\\\sigma) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\gamma (\\\\sigma) or, writing the integrals over C0 as expectations: :\\\\mathbb{E} \\\\big[ \\\\langle abla_{H} F, V \\\\rangle \\\\big] = - \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\big[ F \\\\operatorname{div} V \\\\big], where the \\"divergence\\" div(V) : C0 ‚Üí R is defined by :\\\\operatorname{div} (V) (\\\\sigma) := - \\\\int_{0}^{T} \\\\dot{V}_{t} (\\\\sigma) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\sigma_{t}.

They toured heavily and issued a demo, but never released any albums. History The band started in Burnaby, a suburb of Vancouver, during the summer of 1977, when the members of rock band Stone Crazy, who played Led Zeppelin covers among others, became interested in punk rock after seeing The Ramones live. Joey Keithley, a.k.a. Joey Shithead, was the singer, Brian Roy Goble, a.k.a. Wimpy Roy, the bass player, Simon Werner the guitar player and Ken Montgomery, a.k.a. Dimwit, the drummer. All of them were former members of Stone Crazy except Werner, who replaced Stone Crazy guitar player Brad Kent. (Kent, however, still played with the Skulls on several occasions). The Skulls played the (mostly hostile) club circuit in Vancouver and recorded a few songs at Psi-chords Studios, including \\"Fucked Up Baby\\", which would later become a D.O.A. song. (This track surfaced years later on Zulu Records' double album retrospective, Last Call. The demo tape was never released at the time, except to local critics for review). There was not really much a scene yet, however, escept for The Furies (which had Simon Werner's brother Jonathan on bass) and The Dishrags, so The Skulls (without Brad Kent, but with roadie Gerry Useless, who had been in Stone Crazy) decided to move to Toronto. However, the band split up: Joey and Dimwit returned to Vancouver, while Simon Werner and Wimpy moved to London (Wimpy returned to Vancouver a few months later). Joe formed D.O.A., while Dimwit, Wimpy and Gerry Useless formed The Subhumans. After the Subhumans broke up in 1982, Wimpy joined DOA, which now featured Dimwit on drums, who had just been in the Pointed Sticks. For the next several years DOA's lineup was a virtual copy of the Skulls lineup, but with Dave Gregg instead of Simon Werner. Werner was joined in London by Jim Walker, who landed a job with Public Image Ltd., appearing on their debut album before quitting. Werner, with his brother Joanathan, formed The Pack, which featured Kirk Brandon, who later joined Theatre Of Hate. Jim Walker also joined the Pack, and, upon that band's dissolution, all three met up again in the Straps, with was essentially the same band with another singer.

The expanded engine offering split the K-Series into KA- (powered by the 60¬∞ V-8) and KB-Series (powered by the 65¬∞ V-12). 382 In 1933 Lincoln introduced a smaller V-12 to replace the ageing V-8 in the KA-Series. Its 67¬∞ architecture was a significant departure, with four main bearings, offset blocks, and side-by-side connecting rods rather than fork-and-blade. It produced the same 125 hp specific output as the outgoing V-8 despite a somewhat smaller displacement of 381.7 cubic inches. 414 The KA's 381.7 cubic inch V12 was enlarged for 1934 to replace the 1932-design 448. This new engine displaced 414 cu. in. (6.8 L) and produced 150 hp (112 kW). All Lincolns in 1934 (both KA and KB models) were powered by this new 414 V12, and the distinction between models was dropped, with all 1935 Lincolns being simply branded \\"Model K\\". The 414 would last through the end of the Model K's production just before World War II.

It is, however, still attested from epigraphical evidence, notably the Thames scramasax, and its introduction thus cannot postdate the 9th century. It is transliterated as ea, and the Anglo-Saxon rune poem glosses it as :·õ† [ear] by√æ egle eorla geh∆øylcun, / √∞onn[e] f√¶stlice fl√¶sc onginne√æ, / hra∆ø colian, hrusan ceosan / blac to gebeddan; bleda gedreosa√æ, / ∆øynna ge∆øita√æ, ∆øera ges∆øica√æ. :\\" [ear] is horrible to every knight, / when the corpse quickly begins to cool / and is laid in the bosom of the dark earth. / Prosperity declines, happiness passes away / and covenants are broken.\\" Jacob Grimm in his 1835 Teutonic Mythology (ch. 9) attached a deeper significance to the name. He interprets the Old English poem as describing \\"death personified\\", connected to the death-bringing god of war, Ares. He notes that the ear rune is simply a Tyr rune with two barbs attached to it and suggests that Tir and Ear, Old High German Zio and Eor, were two names of the same god. He finds the name in the toponym of Eresburg (*Eresberc) in Westphalia, in Latin Mons martis. Grimm thus suggests that the Germans had adopted the name of Greek Ares as an epithet of their god of war, and Eresberc was literally an Areopagus. Grimm further notes that in the Bavarian (Marcomannic) area, Tuesday (dies Martis) was known as Ertag, Iertag, Irtag, Eritag, Erchtag, Erichtag as opposed to the Swabian and Swiss (Alemannic) region where the same day is Ziestag as in Anglo-Saxon. Grimm concludes that Ziu was known by the alternative name Eor, derived from Greek Ares, and also as Saxnot among the Saxons, identified as a god of the sword.Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie (1935), trans. Stallybrass (1888), chapter 9 : \\"As Zio is identical with Zeus as directors of wars, we see at a glance that Eor, Er, Ear, is one withAres the son of Zeus; and as the Germans had given the rank of Zeus to their Wuotan, T√Ωr and consequently Eor appears as the son of the highest god. [...] Ares itself is used abstractly by the Greeks for destruction, murder, pestilence, just as our Wuotan is for furor and belli impetus, and the Latin Mars for bellum, exitus pugnae, furor bellicus [...] we may fairly bring in the Goth. ha√≠rus, AS. heor, OS. heru, ON. hi√∂rr sword, ensis, cardo, although the names of the rune and the day of the week always appear without the aspirate. For in Greek we already have the two unaspirated words Ares and Aor, sword, weapon, to compare with one another, and these point to a god of the sword. Then again the famous Abrenuntiatio names three heathen gods, Thunar, W√¥den, Saxn√¥t, of whom the third can have been but little inferior to the other two in power and holiness. Sahsn√¥t is word for word gladii consors, ensifer [...] I think we may also bring in the Gallic war-god Hesus or Esus (Lucan 1, 440), and state, that the metal iron is indicated by the planetary sign of Mars, the AS. t√Æres t√¢cen, and consequently that the rune of Zio and Eor may be the picture of a sword with its handle , or of a spear. The Scythian and Alanic legends dwell still more emphatically on the god's sword, and their agreement with Teutonic ways of thinking may safely be assumed, as Mars was equally prominent in the faith of the Scythians and that of the Goths. The impressive personification of the sword matches well with that of the hammer, and to my thinking each confirms the other. Both idea and name of two of the greatest gods pass over into the instrument by which they display their might.\\" References See also *Ior Category:Runes Category:Ares ","title":"Ear (rune)"},{"id":"6599421","text":"WOEX (96.5 MHz \\"√âxitos 96.5\\") is a commercial radio station in Orlando, Florida.

WHOO-AM-FM simulcast their programming and were network affiliates of ABC Radio. =Beautiful music= By the 1960s, WHOO-FM was airing a beautiful music format, no longer simulcast with its parent AM station. WHOO-FM also carried a commercial-free background music service for stores and restaurants, not available to regular FM listeners, but picked up by using special receivers, through a subsidiary communications authority (SCA) subscription service.CentralFloridaRadio.net/WHOO-FM History WHOO-FM was originally powered at 59,000 watts, using a tower at 1,000 feet, with a signal that extensively covered Central Florida, from Tampa Bay to Daytona Beach. WHOO-FM was one of the first stations in Central Florida to be heard in FM stereo full-time. =From country to rock= In the 1980s, the subscription music service was sold. With WHOO airing a personality and information-oriented country music format, management decided to flip WHOO-FM to a music intensive country format as \\"96 Country\\" in 1984. In 1987, WHOO-AM-FM were bought by TK Communications, Inc. The AM station remained country, but on March 1, at midnight, WHOO-FM began stunting with non-stop songs from The Beatles. (That same day, the first Beatles CDs were released.) When the all-Beatles stunt ended, the new owners switched the format to adult-oriented album rock.Broadcasting Yearbook 1990 page B-71 The station's call letters were changed to WHTQ, and it began calling itself \\"Q 96.\\" In the next couple of years, WHTQ moved to a classic rock format. =Cox ownership= TK Communications was sold to Granum Communications in 1995 for $12 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1996 page B-91 In turn, Granum was acquired by Infinity Broadcasting (which was later renamed CBS Radio, now part of Entercom). Infinity quickly spun off WHOO, WMMO and WHTQ to Cox Radio, in order for Infinity to acquire WCKG in Chicago. The classic rock format lasted 23 years. On February 18, 2011, at 5 p.m., after playing \\"Pride (In The Name Of Love)\\" by U2 and after a commercial set, Cox Radio announced that WHTQ would begin adding new rock songs and recent titles, and modify its moniker to \\"96 Rock.\\" It began the new format with \\"Alive\\" by Pearl Jam. In addition to WHTQ tweaking the classic rock format, WJRR switched back to active rock from alternative rock. =Switch to news/talk= Just 6 months after the launch of \\"96 Rock\\", on August 19, 2011, at 5 a.m., after playing \\"Sad but True\\" by Metallica, WHTQ flipped to a simulcast of co-owned news/talk-formatted WDBO.Press Release: WDBO headed to FM dial - Retrieved August 17, 2011. The change followed a decrease in WHTQ's ratings, and a decision to give WDBO's talk format a wider audience by putting it on the powerful 100,000 watt FM signal, which switched its call sign to WDBO-FM. The rock format at first continued on the station's HD Radio signal, 96.5-HD2, for a few months after the switch before being discontinued altogether. WDBO-AM-FM branded itself as FM-96.5 News-Talk WDBO for much of 2012, to emphasize its new availability on FM radio.alt= Programming changes occurred in October 2012, when Clark Howard rejoined the station's lineup after an absence of several years.http://www.news965.com/news/news/wdbo-program-schedule- alert/nSQj2/ The Neal Boortz Show was shortened to two hours and aired from 9 a.m.-11 a.m., which pushed up the local Mel Robbins Show to the 11 a.m.-1 p.m. timeslot. These moves coincided with a change in branding to NewsTalk 96.5 WDBO. Shortly afterward, on November 12, 2012, the news/talk format became FM- only, as WDBO relaunched as a sports radio station affiliated with ESPN Radio.http://www.coxmediagroup.com/news/cmg-press-releases/espn-radio-returns- orlando-debuts-nov-12/nSYbh/ WDBO became the flagship station for the Orlando Magic Radio Network, with WDBO-FM also simulcasting the games.

It starred Rene Russo as Mrs. Gertrude \\"Trudy\\" Lintz and Robbie Coltrane as her husband. The film was based on the life of a gorilla called Massa with elements of Gertrude Lintz's other gorilla Gargantua (who was called \\"Buddy\\" at the time). In real life, Massa became the oldest gorilla on record until 2008, while Buddy/Gargantua died young as a circus attraction and his remains are now on display in a museum. The gorilla suit used for Buddy was created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Plot Millionaire animal lover and overall spoiled rich girl Trudy (Rene Russo) adds Buddy, a gorilla, to her family. Buddy finds life in the city very difficult to deal with. Although Trudy raises him as her own son in her mansion (which also houses a few comical chimpanzees, a kitten, a horse, a cheeky talking green parrot, her prize-winning champion pack of briards, a raccoon, and a flock of geese), he becomes hard to control due to his strength. A particularly bad experience in the Chicago World's fair makes things even harder for Buddy. After he goes on an aggressive rampage and nearly destroys Trudy's home, Buddy is taken to an ape sanctuary to live among his own kind in peace.

Buddy's vocal effects provided by Hector C. Gika, Gary A. Hecker, and Frank Welker. Production notes Rene Russo began rehearsals with the chimpanzees a month before principal photography even started. Reception In spite of the film's message, animal activists still objected over the depiction of chimpanzees as docile pets, happily carrying on wearing human clothes. Among their concerns, the perpetuation of the idea of chimps as acceptable pets is often cited. Buddy received negative reviews from critics, as it holds a 25% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews. The film was criticized for its unrealistic animatronics, especially when compared to the real ape performers.

The name came from the fact that photographic film (also called filmstock) has historically been the primary medium for recording and displaying motion pictures.  What type of thing is film?  Film can be described as all of the following: * Art - aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity.  One of the arts - as an art form, film is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Film is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse. * One of the visual arts - visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature. * One of the performing arts - art forms in which artists use their body, voice, or objects to convey artistic expression. Performing arts include a variety of disciplines but all take the form of a performance in front of an audience. * Fine art - in Western European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function. The word \\"fine\\" here does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons. * Show business - a means of providing employment for actors, screenwriters, artisans and technicians, regardless of whether the finished film was produced as a for-profit enterprise or as a not- for-profit public service. = Other names for film = * Movies naked * Motion pictures * Talking pictures * Pictures * Celluloid * Flicks (or flickers) * Photoplays * Picture shows * The cinema * The silver screen (talkie era); the silver sheet (silent era) * Videos Essence of film * Filmmaking - process of making a film. Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through scriptwriting, casting, shooting, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition. Filmmaking is both an art and an industry. Films were originally recorded onto plastic film which was shown through a movie projector onto a large screen (in other words, an analog recording process). The adoption of CGI-based special effects led to the use of digital intermediates. Most contemporary films are now fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition from start to finish. Cinematic genres Film genre =By setting= *Biography - portrays a real-life character in his or her real-life story *Crime - places its character within realm of criminal activity *Fantasy - films set in imaginary worlds, often with a swords and sorcery theme *Film noir - portrays its principal characters in a nihilistic and existentialist realm or manner *Historical - taking place in the past *Science fiction - placement of characters in an alternative reality, typically in the future or in outer space *Sports - sporting events and locations pertaining to a given sport *War - battlefields and locations pertaining to a time of war *Westerns - colonial period to modern era of the western United States =By mood= *Action - generally involves a moral interplay between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" played out through violence or physical force *Adventure - involving danger, risk, and/or chance, often with a high degree of fantasy *Comedy - intended to provoke laughter *Drama - mainly focuses on character development *Erotic - sexuality or eroticism and sex acts, including love scenes *Horror - intended to provoke fear in audience *Mystery - the progression from the unknown to the known by discovering and solving a series of clues *Romance - dwelling on the elements of romantic love *Thrillers - intended to provoke excitement and/or nervous tension into audience =By format= *Biographical - a biopic is a film that dramatizes the life of an actual person, with varying degrees of basis in fact *Documentary - a factual following of an event or person to gain an understanding of a particular point or issue *Experimental (avant-garde) - created to test audience reaction or to expand the boundaries of film production/story exposition then generally at play *Musical - a film interspersed with singing by all or some of the characters *Silent - a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue =By production type= *Live action - film using actors *Animation - illusion of motion by consecutive display of static images which have been created by hand or on a computer *Television - a film that is produced for and originally distributed by a television network =By length= *Short - may strive to contain many of the elements of a \\"full-length\\" feature, in a shorter time- frame *Serial - similar to shorts, but forms a constant story arc *Feature film - film that is \\"full-length\\" =By age= *Children's film - films for young children; as opposed to a family film, no special effort is made to make the film attractive for other audiences *Family - intended to be attractive for people of all ages and suitable for viewing by a young audience; examples of these are Disney films *Teen film - intended for and aimed towards teens although some teen films, such as the High School Musical series; may also be a family film; not all of these films are suitable for all teens, as some are rated R *Adult film - intended to be viewed only by an adult audience, content may include violence, disturbing themes, obscene language, or explicit sexual behaviour.

It is owned by the Cox Media Group, and airs a classic hits radio format that leans toward classic rock. Most songs heard on WMMO were hits from the 1980s and 90s, on both the Top 40 charts and on the Album Rock charts. WMMO's studios and offices are located in Orlando on North John Young Parkway (Route 423).https://www.wmmo.com/contact-us/ The transmitter tower is off Park Hamilton Boulevard in Pine Hills.Radio-Locator.com/WMMO The site is shared with WTLN, owned by the Salem Media Group. History =Early years= Former logo of the radio station used from August 19, 1990 through January 31, 2001 In the late 1980s, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) awarded a construction permit to build a new FM radio station in Orlando to the Urban Broadcasting Corporation. The call sign WURG was granted as the station was being built.Broadcasting Yearbook 1989 page B-66 The station signed on the air on August 19, 1990.Broadcasting Yearbook 1991 page B-72 It was owned by Radio Orlando and it aired a unique format with a large library, a mix of soft rock, adult album alternative and classic rock, and was considered to be the first ever example of the \\"Rock Adult Contemporary\\" format. Its creators sought to bring back a listening experience similar to early FM rock stations of the late 1960s and 1970s, focusing on music rather than contests and promotions. A popular slogan in its early days was, \\"if you want to win money, play the lottery.\\" WMMO used a wide ranging playlist of songs from many genres. Its library stretched from the mid-1960s to current releases, unlike many stations that focus on small slices of music from specific genres. WMMO also made a promise to always identify songs by title and artist, and to never talk over the music. \\"We love the music as much as you do\\" was a slogan the station used during this era.Central Florida Radio.net/WMMO History =Unusual call sign and transmitter location= The call letters used at first were WEZO. After a month on the air, the call sign switched to WMMO. The station derives its call letters from WMMS in Cleveland; the founding programmer and chief engineer, Cary Pall, was a fan of WMMS, and secured the call sign to honor the legendary rock station, even though WMMO's format was not as rock- oriented.CentralFloridaRadio.net/WMMO History Accessed February 24, 2007. WMMO was one of only two radio stations in the world broadcasting from a fully enclosed transmitter. WMMO was located at the top of the SunBank Center (now the SunTrust Center), Orlando's tallest building.CFLradio.net/WMMO History Its effective radiated power (ERP) was 38,000 watts and its antenna was only 439 feet in height above average terrain (HAAT), while most of the top FM stations in Orlando broadcast at 100,000 watts on towers 1,500 feet or taller. The station's coverage area was limited due to WKGR in Fort Pierce, which broadcasts on 98.7 FM. Around 2015, WKGR's transmitter was moved about 20 miles south to Wellington, near West Palm Beach; because of this, WMMO was able to increase its power and antenna height slightly. =Ownership changes= In 1991, WMMO was bought by Granam Communications for $8.15 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1997 page B-97 The station continued its unique playlist of Soft Rock, Adult Album Rock and Classic Rock. In 1997, Granam Communications was acquired by Infinity Broadcasting, later part of CBS Radio. Infinity quickly spun off WHOO (now WTLN), WHTQ (now WOEX) and WMMO to Cox Radio, so the company could acquire WCKG in Chicago. Cox had plans move WMMO's transmitter to WHTQ's former tower in Pine Hills for better coverage, but a breakdown in negotiations with WHTQ's former owner forced WMMO's transmitter to remain at the SunBank Center/SunTrust Center for several more years. In 2008, longtime personalities Jerry Steffen and Jay Francisco were let go. Steffen was at WMMO for 18 years and Francisco for 14 years. Francisco was rehired in 2011 for several more years. Also in 2011, longtime morning host Shawn Burke was released after 12 years at WMMO. In 2012, the station abandoned its previous practice of listing the names of all the songs and artists played. The music also became more rock-oriented during these years. In July 2015, WMMO began referring to itself as a classic hits station in an effort to compete with classic hits outlet WOCL.

He made his first appearance on 15 December 1992 and remained a regular in the programme for just over a year, before his character was killed off in the Emmerdale plane crash of New Year's Eve 1993. Storylines Leonard came to the village in 1992 as a friend of Amos Brearly (Ronald Magill) that Annie Sugden (Sheila Mercier) met while out visiting Amos in Spain. She invited him back with her and stayed with the Sugden family for Christmas. Annie's son Jack Sugden was very much against the marriage but he and his mother reconciled before she married Leonard. Leonard and Annie married on 28 October 1993 but their marriage only lasted two months. Annie and Leonard decided to emigrate to Spain and whilst Annie's younger son Joe (Frazer Hines) was driving them to the airport on 30 December 1993, a piece of burning wreckage from the Emmerdale plane crash forced Joe's car off the road. Leonard was killed in the accident. He last appeared as a corpse on 5 January 1994. =Legacy= When Annie returns to the village for the funeral of Jack in February 2009, she recalls to Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins) about how Victoria awoke Annie from her coma following the plane crash. She tells Victoria how she lost Leonard, as well as her step-grandson Mark Hughes (Craig McKay) and how the farm was left destroyed. Development Leonard Kempinski was introduced in December 1992 as a new love interest for the show's matriarch Annie Sugden, played by Sheila Mercier. Although Annie had been central to the development of the programme since it first aired back in 1972, she did not feature in many prominent storylines in the 1990s (due to Mercier's age), let alone romantic stories. Annie had been depicted as being close to long time friend Amos Brearly, who although he had proposed to her in January 1973, she had turned him down and producers felt that Amos and Annie were better as friends, as well as the fact that Magill had quit the programme the year previous. When Magill reprised his role as Amos, producers introduced Leonard as part of the rejuvenation of the soap. 1993 was a historic year for the programme, and ironically, this occurred due to low ratings. The soap had been threatened with being axed after nearly 21 years on air, so producers decided to air storylines they felt would boost ratings. One of these was Zoe Tate (Leah Bracknell) coming out as a lesbian (a first on British pre- watershed TV) and another was the wedding of Annie and Leonard, which aired in October 1993. This storyline heralded a new era for the programme, but ratings were not as successful as originally believed. In October 1993, the show had turned 21 and a couple of months later celebrated by airing a story which would mark a turning point in its history. On 30 December 1993 Emmerdale attracted its highest ever audience of over 18 million when a plane crashed into the village, killing four villagers. This led to the villagers deciding to have the village name changed from Beckindale to Emmerdale to help get over the plane crash. Leonard was axed by producers as they felt that the character had naturally reached an end, and it would allow for more scenes involving Mercier who was forced to come to terms with the death of a second husband after only a short period of marriage.

Estimated to have been installed during the 16th century, it was used as an alternative to beheading by axe or sword. Halifax was once part of the Manor of Wakefield, where ancient custom and law gave the Lord of the Manor the authority to execute summarily by decapitation any thief caught with stolen goods to the value of 13¬Ωd or more, or who confessed to having stolen goods of at least that value. Decapitation was a fairly common method of execution in England, but Halifax was unusual in two respects: it employed a guillotine- like machine that appears to have been unique in the country, and it continued to decapitate petty criminals until the mid-17th century. The device consisted of an axe head fitted to the base of a heavy wooden block that ran in grooves between two tall uprights, mounted on a stone base about high. A rope attached to the block ran over a pulley, allowing it to be raised, after which the rope was secured by attaching it to a pin in the base. The block carrying the axe was then released either by withdrawing the pin or by cutting the rope once the prisoner was in place. Almost 100 people were beheaded in Halifax between the first recorded execution in 1286 and the last in 1650, but as the date of the gibbet's installation is uncertain, it cannot be determined with any accuracy how many individuals died via the Halifax Gibbet. By 1650, public opinion considered beheading to be an excessively severe punishment for petty theft; use of the gibbet was forbidden by Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, and the structure was dismantled. The stone base was rediscovered and preserved in about 1840, and a non-working replica was erected on the site in 1974. The names of 52 people known to have been beheaded by the device are listed on a nearby plaque.  History  What became known as the Halifax Gibbet Law gave the Lord of the Manor of Wakefield, of which the town of Halifax was a part, the power to try and execute any felon for the theft of goods to the value of 13¬Ωd or more: 17th- century engraving The Gibbet Law may have been a last vestige of the Anglo- Saxon custom of infangtheof, which allowed landowners to enforce summary justice on thieves within the boundaries of their estates. Samuel Midgley in his Halifax and its Gibbet-Law Placed in a True Light, published in 1761, states that the law dates from a time \\"not in the memory of man to the contrary\\". It may have been the consequence of rights granted by King Henry III to John de Warenne (1231‚Äì1304), Lord of the Manor of Wakefield. Such baronial jurisdiction was by no means unusual in medieval England and was described in the 11th-century legal text entitled De Baronibus, qui suas habent curias et consuetudines (Concerning the barons who have their courts of law and customs). Neither was the decapitation of convicted felons unique to Halifax; the earls of Chester amongst others also exercised the right to \\"behead any malefactor or thief, who was apprehended in the action, or against whom it was made apparent by sufficient witness, or confession, before four inhabitants of the place\\", recorded as the Custom of Cheshire. A commission appointed by King Edward I in 1278 reported that there were at that time 94 privately owned gibbets and gallows in use in Yorkshire, including one owned by the Archbishop of York. What was unusual about Halifax was that the custom lingered on there for so long after it had been abandoned elsewhere. Suspected thieves were detained in the custody of the lord of the manor's bailiff, who would summon a jury of 16 local men \\"out of the most wealthy and best reputed\\", four each from four local townships. The jury had only two questions to decide on: were the stolen goods found in the possession of the accused, and were they worth at least 13¬Ωd. The jury, the accused, and those claiming that their property had been stolen, were brought together in a room at the bailiff's house. No oaths were administered and there was no judge or defence counsel present; each side presented their case, and the jury decided on guilt or innocence. The law was applied so strictly that anyone who apprehended a thief with his property was not allowed to recover it unless the miscreant and the stolen goods were presented to the bailiff. The goods were otherwise forfeited to the lord of the manor, and their previous rightful owner was liable to find himself charged with theftbote, or conniving in the felony. Halifax's reputation for strict law enforcement was noted by the antiquary William Camden and by the \\"Water Poet\\" John Taylor, who penned the Beggar's Litany: \\"From Hell, Hull, and Halifax, Good Lord, deliver us!\\" Before his execution a convicted felon was usually detained in custody for three market days, on each of which he was publicly displayed in the stocks, accompanied by the stolen goods. After the sentence had been carried out a county coroner would visit Halifax and convene a jury of 12 men, sometimes the same individuals who had found the felon guilty, and ask them to give an account under oath of the circumstances of the conviction and execution, for the official records. The punishment could only be meted out to those within the confines of the Forest of Hardwick, of which Halifax was a part. The gibbet was about from the boundary of the area, and if the condemned person succeeded in escaping from the forest then he could not legally be brought back to face his punishment. At least two men succeeded in cheating the executioner in that way: a man named Dinnis and another called Lacy. Dinnis was never seen in Halifax again, but Lacy rather unwisely decided to return to the town seven years after his escape; he was apprehended and finally executed in 1623. The earliest known record of punishment by decapitation in Halifax is the beheading of John of Dalton in 1286, but official records were not maintained until the parish registers began in 1538. Between then and 1650, when the last executions took place, 56 men and women are recorded as having been decapitated. The total number of executions identified since 1286 is just short of 100. Local weavers specialised in the production of kersey, a hardwearing and inexpensive woollen fabric that was often used for military uniforms; by the 16th century Halifax and the surrounding Calder Valley was the largest producer of the material in England. In the final part of the manufacturing process the cloth was hung outdoors on large structures known as tenterframes and left to dry, after having been conditioned by a fulling mill. Daniel Defoe wrote a detailed account of what he had been told of the gibbet's history during his visit to Halifax in Volume 3 of his A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, published in 1727. He reports that \\"Modern accounts pretend to say, it [the gibbet] was for all sorts of felons; but I am well assured, it was first erected purely, or at least principally, for such thieves as were apprehended stealing cloth from the tenters; and it seems very reasonable to think it was so\\". Eighteenth-century historians argued that the area's prosperity attracted the \\"wicked and ungovernable\\"; the cloth, left outside and unattended, presented easy pickings, and hence justified severe punishment to protect the local economy. James Holt on the other hand, writing in 1997, sees the Halifax Gibbet Law as a practical application of the Anglo- Saxon law of infangtheof. Royal assizes were held only twice a year in the area; to bring a prosecution was \\"vastly expensive\\", and the stolen goods were forfeited to the Crown, as they were considered to be the property of the accused. But the Halifax Gibbet Law allowed \\"the party injured, to have his goods restored to him again, with as little loss and damage, as can be contrived; to the great encouragement of the honest and industrious, and as great terror to the wicked and evil doers.\\" The Halifax Gibbet's final victims were Abraham Wilkinson and Anthony Mitchell. Wilkinson had been found guilty of stealing of russet-coloured kersey cloth, of which, found in his possession, was valued at \\"9 shillings at the least\\", and Mitchell of stealing and selling two horses, one valued at 9 shillings and the other at 48 shillings. The pair were found guilty and executed on the same day, 30 April 1650. Writing in 1834 John William Parker, publisher of The Saturday Magazine, suggested that the gibbet might have remained in use for longer in Halifax had the bailiff not been warned that if he used it again he would be \\"called to public account for it\\". Midgley comments that the final executions \\"were by some persons in that age, judged to be too severe; thence came it to pass, that the gibbet, and the customary law, for the forest of Hardwick, got its suspension\\". Oliver Cromwell finally ended the exercise of Halifax Gibbet Law. To the Puritans it was \\"part of ancient ritual to be jettisoned along with all the old feasts and celebrations of the medieval world and the Church of Rome\\". Moreover, it ran counter to the Puritan objection to imposing the death penalty for petty theft; felons were subsequently sent to the Assizes in York for trial.  Mechanism  Thomas Allen's A New and Complete History of the County of York (1829) It is uncertain when the Halifax Gibbet was first introduced, but it may not have been until some time in the 16th century; before then decapitation would have been carried out by an executioner using an axe or a sword. The device, which seems to have been unique in England, consisted of two tall parallel beams of wood joined at the top by a transverse beam. Running in grooves within the beams was a square wooden block in length, into the bottom of which was fitted an axe head weighing . The whole structure sat on a platform of stone blocks, square and high, which was ascended by a flight of steps. A rope attached to the top of the wooden block holding the axe ran over a pulley at the top of the structure, allowing the block to be raised. The rope was then fastened by a pin to the structure's stone base. The gibbet could be operated by cutting the rope supporting the blade or by pulling out the pin that held the rope. If the offender was to be executed for stealing an animal, a cord was fastened to the pin and tied to either the stolen animal or one of the same species, which was then driven off, withdrawing the pin and allowing the blade to drop. In an early contemporary account of 1586 Raphael Holinshed attests to the efficiency of the gibbet, and adds some detail about the participation of the onlookers: An article in the September 1832 edition of The Imperial Magazine describes the victim's final moments: In Thomas Deloney's novel Thomas of Reading (1600) the invention of the Halifax Gibbet is attributed to a friar, who proposed the device as a solution to the difficulty of finding local residents willing to act as hangmen. Although the guillotine as a method of beheading is most closely associated in the popular imagination with late 18th-century Revolutionary France, several other decapitation devices had long been in use throughout Europe. It is uncertain whether Dr Guillotin was familiar with the Halifax Gibbet, but its design was reported to have been copied by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, in the production of a similar device that became known as the Scottish Maiden, now on display in the National Museum of Scotland. The Maiden was rather shorter than the Halifax Gibbet, standing only tall, the same height as the French guillotine.  Restoration  The Halifax Gibbet was dismantled after the last executions in 1650, and the site was neglected until the platform on which the gibbet had been mounted was rediscovered in about 1840. A full-size non-working replica was erected on the original stone base in August 1974; it includes a blade made from a casting of the original, which as of 2011 is displayed in the Bankfield Museum in Boothtown on the outskirts of Halifax. A commemorative plaque nearby lists the names of the 52 people known to have been executed by the device.

WRUM broadcasts using the HD radio hybrid format. The HD2 subchannel carries a bilingual CHR format, known as \\"Mega 97.1.\\" The subchannel feeds two FM translators at 97.1 MHz. History The station signed on in 1950 as WKIS- FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1961-1962 page B-38 It originally simulcast AM 740 WKIS (now WYGM). The two stations were owned by Central Florida Broadcasting and were network affiliates of NBC. In 1971, the simulcast ended. WKIS and WKIS-FM were sold to separate companies, with the FM station acquired by the Shamrock Development Company.Broadcasting Yearbook 1972 page B-45 The new management installed an progressive rock format, switching the call sign to WDIZ. Over time, the station's playlist focused on the top selling albums and rock artists, as the station shifted to album-oriented rock. In 1996, the station switched to all oldies as WSHE. San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications acquired the station in 1997. Clear Channel was the forerunner to today's iHeartMedia. In 2004, the call letters were switched to WEBG. In 2005, the station flipped to a Spanish-language tropical music sound, although over time, Latin pop and Reggaeton took over more of the playlist.

Niistaxo'ok Wright held the name Niistaxo'ok, an hereditary name-title associated with chieftainship of the House of Niistaxo'ok, the clan Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan) house-group (or matrilineal extended family) of the Gits'ilaas√º (a.k.a. Kitselas) tribe. In the Prologue to Men of Medeek he summarized his chiefly position as follows: > \\"I have 'Power' on both sides of The Big Canyon [i.e. the Kitselas Canyon]. > On the right hand side I have the power of my Chieftainship. For many > generations Neas-D-Hok [i.e. Niistaxo'ok] has had that right. On the left > hand side I carry the 'Power' of Neas Hiwas, for in my generation there is > no Chief of that name.\\" This is a reference to Niishaywaaxs, a house-chief name belonging to another Kitselas Gispwudwada house from the other side of Kitselas Canyon. Niishaywaaxs had also been held by Wright's grandfather, whom he credited with teaching him the oral histories recorded in the book. Wright was a river-boat pilot on the Skeena River, helming the Hudson's Bay Company sternwheelers, Mount Royal and Hazelton, work he performed until his eyesight began to fail. In later years he was blind. He was also an Envoy in the Salvation Army. Men of Medeek Wright dictated Men of Medeek to Will Robinson, a local justice of the peace, in 1935‚Äì36, but it was not published until 1962, after Wright and Robinson had both died. The oral clan histories (adawx) he tells include narrations of the coming of the Gispwudwada people to Kitselas Canyon and intersect with the exploits of Tsimshian Laxsgiik (Eagle clan) chiefs such as Ligeex of the Gispaxlo'ots and Gitxon of Kitselas. The word \\"medeek\\" (midiik) is the Tsimshian word for grizzly-bear, one of the crests (\\"totems\\") of Wright's branch of the Gispwudwada. (Medeek (a.k.a. McDeek) Avenue in Terrace is so named because of Wright's totemic affiliation.) Wright also recorded narratives in the 1920s and later with the trained Tsimshian ethnologist and chief William Beynon. Family Wright had seven sisters, whose marriages were arranged so as to create matrikin and potential heirs (matrilineal nephews) in a variety of surrounding First Nations communities that figure in the adawx told in Men of Medeek, including Hartley Bay, Lax Kw'alaams, and Kitamaat. (Wright's obituary referred to him as originally \\"hailing from Kitimaat,\\" though we know the key parts of his ancestry were Kitselas.) One sister, Eliza, married Tom Thornhill, the first white settler in the Kitselas area. Wright died November 14, 1949, at the purported age of 84 years, although when he dictated Men of Medeek (1935‚Äì36) he gave his age as 65. Other sources put his age at death as 104. A newspaper report on his funeral services identified \\"the new chief of the Kitselas people,\\" Wright's picked successor, as Wright's sister's son, Walter Nyce, of Kitamaat, B.C. Chiefly succession According to another account of the chiefly succession, Wright, late in life, visited his sister Rhoda Wright Bates, a Hartley Bay resident, at a Skeena River cannery where she was performing seasonal labour and asked that his matrilineal great-great-nephew Clarence Anderson, her grandson, then 14 years old, be taken \\"back with him to be trained,\\" also prearranging Clarence's eventual marriage; Anderson eventually succeeded to the name Niistaxo'ok. (This version is from a published account by Anderson's wife, the anthropologist Margaret Seguin Anderson and daughter Tammy Anderson Blumhagen.) Will Robinson's will urged his family to publish the remaining portion of the Wright manuscript, titled Wars of Medeek. This proviso was forgotten until Robinson's granddaughter Enid DuPuis rediscovered Robinson's papers. Another grandchild, Barry Robinson, then contacted Glenn Bennett, Chief Councillor of the Kitselas Band, and was put in touch with Wright's grandson, Ralph Wright, himself a former Chief Councillor who had remembered hearing the stories orally from his grandfather. A limited edition comprising both Men of Medeek and Wars of Medeek was published by Barry Robinson in 2003 and gifted to the Kitselas Nation along with some 50 presentation books given to the Chiefs and dignitaries. All the original documentation and copyrights were given to the Kitselas Nations in 2003 by Barry Robinson.

Rosenberg as assistant secretary of Defense in the administration of President Harry S. Truman. This campaign led to an investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee. Early life Born in Norman, Oklahoma, the eldest of three surviving children of Irish immigrant Connell B. McGinley (1852 - 1941) and his wife, Catherine. McGinley preferred to be known by his middle name Conde. He married Celia Brown around 1918. Around this time he claimed that he was \\"Secretary of the Grady County Highway Association\\" in Chickasha, Oklahoma. He moved with his parents to the Dallas, Texas area, where his daughter Nona was born in 1927, and where his father died in 1941. Career =Common Sense= McGinley moved to New Jersey in 1929, opening a chain of restaurants along the shore. During World War II, he worked as an inspector in a defense plant. In 1946, he began editing a weekly paper in Newark, New Jersey called variously Think, The Think and Think Weekly. By June 1947, it was issued as Common Sense. In November 1947, the headquarters were transferred to Union Township, Union County, New Jersey. The paper became semi-monthly in 1948. Although the first issues were anti-Communist, it later developed into a mostly anti-Semitic broadsheet, produced by himself, with his son and daughter-in-law. Around 1948, he sued America magazine and others (including Walter Winchell) for libel, and the case dragged on for about seven years. In one issue of 1948, a major part of the paper was taken up by support for Robert Best, who had been convicted of treason (broadcasting Nazi propaganda from Germany during World War II). In the July and August 1949 issues, W. Henry MacFarland Jr.'s name appears as associate editor. \\"At the time Conde was planning to combine forces with MacFarland's Nationalist Action League, as well as with the Loyal American Group, headed by William J. O'Brien.\\" O'Brien later joined the paper's staff. The paper carried articles by Eustace Mullins starting September 1951. In 1953, he became a writer on staff. In addition, articles were written by Frederick C. F. Weiss, Kurt Mertig (founder of the National Renaissance Party), Elizabeth Dilling, Lyrl Clark Van Hyning, Gen. George Van Horn Moseley, Col. Eugene N. Sanctuary and Charles B. Hudson. Circulation, at its height, averaged 50,000 copies. The paper's contributor, Col. Eugene Sanctuary, had, among other things, written a pamphlet, Is the New Deal Communist?, in which he made a 35-point comparison of The New Deal to Karl Marx's 1848 program. He also wrote an editor's note in I. B. Pranaitis' The Talmud Unmasked: The Secret Rabbinical Teachings Concerning Christians (1939). =Involvement with the House Un-American Activities Committee= At the confirmation hearings for Anna Rosenberg, McGinley and others associated with him were prominently figured, including Benjamin H. Freedman, who had partially financed Common Sense. The fallout of this dispute brought him into the sights of House Un-American Activities Committee, which issued a 1954 report condemning his propaganda.:Preliminary Report on Neo-Fascist and Hate Groups (PDF file, 3 Meg), Committee on Un- American Activities, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. 1954 In response, \\"Conde McGinley of Common Sense urged the committee to hold a public hearing and 'if we cannot prove our statements we'll be very willing to cease publication'.\\"Ancestry.com site - available only in Cache version =Christian Education Association= In 1954, McGinley formed the Christian Education Association with himself as president, his son as secretary/treasurer and Alex Jefimow as vice-president. The operation was at 530 Chestnut Street in Union, a building owned by Katherine Lettig, who was also a volunteer for the paper. The group also operated the Union Patriotic Press, whose officers were Charles Kane, John J. Reynolds and Edward J. Byrne. In 1955, he was sued for $250,000 in punitive damages, for libel, by Rabbi Joachim Prinz (1902-1988) in Superior Court in Newark, New Jersey.

He is a clone of Superboy. Match appeared in the Superboy title, issues of Young Justice and the Sins of Youth and Joker's Last Laugh crossover events. Currently, he is a member of the Titans East, which debuted in Teen Titans #43. Fictional character biography =The Agenda= Cover to Superboy #36 by Ramon Bernado. Match's original appearance, including his blond hairstyle, which later changed to resemble Bizarro. Created using Superboy's DNA, Match was made to serve \\"the Agenda\\"Superboy (vol. 4) #35 (January 1997). DC Comics. a secret organization specializing in creating clone armies. Agent Amanda Spence was able to kidnap Superboy and the Agenda used his DNA to create the clone Match. Match was given implanted memories, like Superboy, but they included a greater host of information that Superboy did not have. He also had improved durability as well as greater control over his powers. In fact, it is believed by someSuperboy (vol. 4) #36 (February 1997). DC Comics. that the host of data he was given helped him hone his powers. In the resulting battle between the two clones, Superboy managed to come out on top and the reactor holding the Agenda's compound together exploded, destroying the base. Match was left alone and ailing. Some time later, the Agenda kidnapped Superboy again and took over Project Cadmus. When the Agenda kidnapped Superboy, Match took his place in Young Justice. At this time, Project Cadmus was also infiltrated by several clones loyal to the Agenda. Eventually, Superboy freed himself and joined the fight against Match and the Agenda to free Cadmus.Superboy (vol. 4) #74 (May 2000). DC Comics. During Joker's Last Laugh, after being poisoned with Joker venom, Match returned to infiltrate and terrorize Young Justice disguised to look like Superboy. While Superboy was away, Match was at Young Justice headquarters with Empress, Secret, Arrowette, and Wonder Girl in the hopes of killing them in a comical manner. While the Jokerized Match was unable to keep his plans secret from the girls, they simply believed he was Superboy pretending to be a Jokerized Match to try to lighten the mood after Robin and Impulse both quit earlier that day. Match left however after accidentally making Wonder Girl confess her love for Superboy, causing Match to develop feelings for her as well.Young Justice #38 (December 2001). DC Comics. =Titans East= The criminal mercenary Deathstroke begun forming Titans East, a team created explicitly to take down the Teen Titans. Though he was a powerful physical asset to the team, Match's presence was more of a psychological ploy, due to Superboy's death during the Infinite Crisis event. Deathstroke counted on Match's resemblance to Superboy, enhanced by changing his costume to match Superboy's last costume, to unbalance Robin, Superboy's best friend and the Titans' leader, and Wonder Girl, Superboy's girlfriend and one of the Titans' most powerful members. Match's first appearance in Teen Titans #43 shows that both his mind and body have begun to rot away, making him behave more like a normal Bizarro clone, even going so far as to speak in contradictions. He appears to still have feelings for Wonder Girl, as he claims \\"I hate Wonder Girl\\". Following that, in Teen Titans #44, Wonder Girl wakes up in what seems to be a replica of the Fortress of Solitude in Slade's Titans Tower in New York. She sees what appears to be Superboy on a throne, but it is, in fact, Match, who claims \\"You so ugly when you sleep, me hate to watch you\\", continuing to speak in opposite logic as his body and mind deteriorate. As he attempts to force his feelings on Wonder Girl, Match is unexpectedly attacked by Robin and Batgirl (who was freed from Slade's influence). His body appears less invulnerable than before, as Robin's throwing R's managed to cut into the clone's back. Wonder Girl, still furious at Match's very existence began an all out assault against the clone, only to still end up defeated along with her other teammates by Match and the other Titans East. When Nightwing, Donna Troy, Flash (Bart Allen) and Beast Boy arrive with Cyborg, Raven and Duela Dent, the unified Titans battle against the Titans East one last time. Match is defeated when Wonder Girl reflects his heat-vision back at him with her bracelets after which Jericho possesses his unconscious body. But due to Match's Kryptonian powers, he was proven too dangerous to turn over to conventional authorities. As such, Jericho continued to control Match's body, which proved difficult for him after a point. At one point Match managed to break free of Jericho's control and began destroying Titans Tower. Wonder Girl however manages to soothe him long enough for him to become submissive to Jericho's control again. Later Jericho, still trapped in Match's body, seemingly escapes from S.T.A.R. Labs in visible distress and asking for his friends' help.Titans (vol. 2) #6 (December 2008). DC Comics. The Titans attempt to separate the two, only for Match to break free, with Jericho screaming in panic that he can not control him. When the two are finally separated, however, it is revealed that it was Match who was panicked, and that Jericho, whose mind had been corrupted by the time spent trapped inside Match, was in control of their shared body.Titans (vol. 2) #7 (January 2009). DC Comics. Match is later tracked down and killed by Superboy-Prime, who then turns his body over to the rogue scientist Doctor Calligan. Calligan dissects Match's body and uses it to reverse engineer three clones of Superboy that resemble the hero when he first appeared, during his time with Young Justice, and during the brief period when he was brainwashed by Lex Luthor, respectively.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #99 (October 2011). DC Comics. During the ensuing battle, Robin and Ravager destroy all three clones by using a Kryptonite blade.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #100 (October 2011). DC Comics. Appearance Originally, Match's physical appearance was practically identical to Superboy's, except for white hair and pale eyes (in comparison to Superboy's black hair and blue eyes) and a \\"brand\\" of the Agenda's logo on the left side of his chest. This logo was also on his original costume, two intertwined double helixes (most likely to represent DNA) that form a shape akin to three circles. Match's look is currently very similar to a Bizarro clone of Superboy. Like Superboy after his redesign, Match has jeans and black T-shirt. However, the shirt has several tears or holes and the \\"S\\" shield is reversed, like Bizarro's. His body exhibits extreme skin calcification, a trait he shares with Bizarro. Due to genetic damage which accumulated over time, his mental and speech patterns currently resemble those of a Bizarro. Powers and abilities Match has exhibited powers similar to Superboy, but supposedly had greater control. These powers include tactile telekinesis which can mimic Superman's powers of flight and super-strength, but can also be used to disassemble machinery. Occasionally, he has also displayed the ability to create blasts of energy from his eyes. Although Superboy eventually began to develop real Kryptonian powers from exposure to Earth's yellow sun, it is unclear if Match has developed such powers as well. It appears that Match's cloned body and mind are slowly rotting away over time, leaving the full extent of his current powers questionable. His body appears to be less shielded or invulnerable, as Robin and Batgirl managed to cause him pain by striking him with Robin's throwing R's.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #42-46 (February‚ÄìJune 2007). DC Comics. Other versions A child version of Match appears in Tiny Titans #25, along with Superboy. It is revealed that he has \\"magic words\\", which causes him to attack to get the object which has been mentioned. This includes \\"puppy\\" (causing him to chase Krypto) and \\"bubblegum\\" causing him to jump on Speedy and take a stick of the said gum from him.Tiny Titans #25. DC Comics. In other media =Television= Match appears in the Young Justice episode \\"Agendas\\" voiced by Nolan North. Rather than being a clone of Superboy, Match is introduced as the first clone of Superman created by Cadmus Labs from a pure sample of Kryptonian DNA (unlike Superboy, who is made from DNA from both Superman and Lex Luthor). Match possesses the full range of Kryptonian powers and is almost identical to Superboy, with the exception of eyes with black sclera. He carved a backwards S-shield into his chest with his heat vision, resembling the number 2. He has been conditioned to respond violently to the sight of the Superman logo. Match gets his name from Luthor who wanted Superman to \\"meet his match\\" (as well as the experiment named \\"Project Match\\"). However, due to the difficulties involved in replicating Kryptonian DNA, Match turned out to be mentally (and possibly physically) unstable and was placed in cryogenic storage. Match goes on a rampage after being freed by Superboy and is returned to cryogenic storage after being recaptured. In \\"Auld Acquaintance\\", the cryogenic pod used to hold Match was among the items stolen by Lex Luthor, Ra's al Ghul, Queen Bee, Ocean Master, and Brain after they had infiltrated Project Cadmus. =Miscellaneous= Match appears in the 22nd issue of the Young Justice tie- in comic. In 2015, Match re-appears as a much-more deformed individual where he had gotten paler, his left leg and the left side of his face had swollen, and his right arm had become oversized. He fights Batgirl until she got the better of him using a foam and smoke pellet. Match was later taken away by a LexCorp van.Young Justice #22 References Category:DC Comics supervillains Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:Comics characters introduced in 1997 Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Fictional clones Category:Fictional genetically engineered characters Category:Kryptonians Category:Characters created by Ron Marz Category:Superboy ","title":"Match (DC Comics)"},{"id":"6599701","text":"In mathematics, the H-derivative is a notion of derivative in the study of abstract Wiener spaces and the Malliavin calculus.

The first line-up of the band featured McMahon on vocals and guitar, Chris Schleyer on guitar and Andy Kubiszewski on drums. The band was known for its glam rock and new wave influences. History From 1989 to 1992, Kevin McMahon lived in Los Angeles and continued to write songs, after the dissolution of his previous project, Lucky Pierre. In 1992, started a new unnamed project and recorded four demo songs with Trent Reznor, a longtime friend and a former Lucky Pierre member who found success with his new project, Nine Inch Nails. These songs were recorded in Reznor's Le Pig studio and featured a re-recording of a track from Lucky Pierre's 1988 Communiqu√© EP. After Reznor was fully immersed in the recording of Nine Inch Nails' second album, The Downward Spiral, McMahon went to England to collaborate with British producer Warne Livesey. Meanwhile, he was joined up with guitarist Chris Schleyer and drummer Andy Kubiszewski, who was known for his involvement in the bands Exotic Birds and Stabbing Westward and recorded eight songs with them. The band signed to Nothing Records of Interscope, a vanity label founded by Reznor and former Lucky Pierre manager John Malm Jr.. The band completed their first record. In 1994, McMahon assembled a live band for this project. The new line-up featured Kevin McMahon on vocals and guitar, Chris Schleyer on lead guitar, Sebastien Monney on bass, Brian Kehew on keyboards and Sean Furlong on drums. The band performed under the name Riverhead in clubs in Los Angeles, unbeknownst to Nothing/Interscope Records. Kehew eventually left the band after 3 shows and was replaced by Paul Roessler in late 1994. The band subsequently changed its name to Prick and released its debut 7-inch single, \\"Communiqu√©\\", which was followed by the band's self-titled debut album in 1995. The album sold 66,000 copies. The track \\"Animal\\" became a minor alternative radio hit and its music video was released at the same year. Furlong and Roessler were fired from the band in 1995. Garrett Hammond replaced Furlong on drums and Dave Ogilvie was hired for live programming. The band performed as a supporting act to David Bowie, alongside Nine Inch Nails on Outside Tour in 1995. In 1996, McMahon played guitar for three Nine Inch Nails shows on Nights of Nothing tour and was backed by them on two Prick tracks. In 1996, McMahon moved to London to record a follow-up Prick's debut album. Nevertheless, the label did not support his efforts for the second album, due to creative differences and McMahon's reluctance in producing a more radio-friendly effort. Prick was subsequently unsigned from Nothing Records. In 1999, McMahon was able acquire the publishing rights for his songs from Interscope. In 2002, he released Prick's second studio album, The Wreckard, independently through Lucky Pierre Music's official website. At the same year, he assembled a new line-up for the Prick, consisting of Greg Zydyk on guitar, former Lucky Pierre member Tom Lash on bass and Andy Kubiszewski on drums. The band briefly performed in 2002 and 2003.

Genetic material must reach the genome of the host cell to induce gene expression. Successful gene delivery requires the foreign genetic material to remain stable within the host cell and can either integrate into the genome or replicate independently of it. This requires foreign DNA to be synthesized as part of a vector, which is designed to enter the desired host cell and deliver the transgene to that cell's genome. Vectors utilized as the method for gene delivery can be divided into two categories, recombinant viruses and synthetic vectors (viral and non-viral). In complex multicellular eukaryotes (more specifically Weissmanists), if the transgene is incorporated into the host's germline cells, the resulting host cell can pass the transgene to its progeny. If the transgene is incorporated into somatic cells, the transgene will stay with the somatic cell line, and thus its host organism. Gene delivery is a necessary step in gene therapy for the introduction or silencing of a gene to promote a therapeutic outcome in patients and also has applications in the genetic modification of crops. There are many different methods of gene delivery for various types of cells and tissues.  History  Viral based vectors emerged in the 1980s as a tool for transgene expression. In 1983, Albert Siegel described the use of viral vectors in plant transgene expression although viral manipulation via cDNA cloning was not yet available. The first virus to be used as a vaccine vector was the vaccinia virus in 1984 as a way to protect chimpanzees against hepatitis B. Non-viral gene delivery was first reported on in 1943 by Avery et al. who showed cellular phenotype change via exogenous DNA exposure.  Methods  Bacterial transformation involves moving a gene from one bacteria to another. It is integrated into the recipients plasmid. and can then be expressed by the new host. There are a variety of methods available to deliver genes to host cells. When genes are delivered to bacteria or plants the process is called transformation and when it is used to deliver genes to animals it is called transfection. This is because transformation has a different meaning in relation to animals, indicating progression to a cancerous state. For some bacteria no external methods are need to introduce genes as they are naturally able to take up foreign DNA. Most cells require some sort of intervention to make the cell membrane permeable to DNA and allow the DNA to be stably inserted into the hosts genome. = Chemical = Chemical based methods of gene delivery can use natural or synthetic compounds to form particles that facilitate the transfer of genes into cells. These synthetic vectors have the ability to electrostatically bind DNA or RNA and compact the genetic information to accommodate larger genetic transfers. Chemical vectors usually enter cells by endocytosis and can protect genetic material from degradation.  Heat shock  One of the simplest method involves altering the environment of the cell and then stressing it by giving it a heat shock. Typically the cells are incubated in a solution containing divalent cations (often calcium chloride) under cold conditions, before being exposed to a heat pulse. Calcium chloride partially disrupts the cell membrane, which allows the recombinant DNA to enter the host cell. It is suggested that exposing the cells to divalent cations in cold condition may change or weaken the cell surface structure, making it more permeable to DNA. The heat-pulse is thought to create a thermal imbalance across the cell membrane, which forces the DNA to enter the cells through either cell pores or the damaged cell wall.  Calcium phosphate  Another simple methods involves using calcium phosphate to bind the DNA and then exposing it to cultured cells. The solution, along with the DNA, is encapsulated by the cells and a small amount of DNA can be integrated into the genome.  Liposomes and polymers  Liposomes and polymers can be used as vectors to deliver DNA into cells. Positively charged liposomes bind with the negatively charged DNA, while polymers can be designed that interact with DNA. They form lipoplexes and polyplexes respectively, which are then up-taken by the cells. The two systems can also be combined. Polymer-based non-viral vectors uses polymers to interact with DNA and form polyplexes.  Nanoparticles  The use of engineered inorganic and organic nanoparticles is another non-viral approach for gene delivery.Singh BN, Prateeksha, Gupta VK, Chen J, Atanasov AG. Organic Nanoparticle-Based Combinatory Approaches for Gene Therapy. Trends Biotechnol. 2017 Dec;35(12):1121‚Äì1124. doi: 10.1016/j.tibtech.2017.07.010. = Physical = Artificial gene delivery can be mediated by physical methods which uses force to introduce genetic material through the cell membrane.  Electroporation  alt=Electroporation is a method of promoting competence. Cells are briefly shocked with an electric field of 10-20 kV/cm, which is thought to create holes in the cell membrane through which the plasmid DNA may enter. After the electric shock, the holes are rapidly closed by the cell's membrane- repair mechanisms.  Biolistics  A gene gun uses biolistics to insert DNA into cells Another method used to transform plant cells is biolistics, where particles of gold or tungsten are coated with DNA and then shot into young plant cells or plant embryos. Some genetic material enters the cells and transforms them. This method can be used on plants that are not susceptible to Agrobacterium infection and also allows transformation of plant plastids. Plants cells can also be transformed using electroporation, which uses an electric shock to make the cell membrane permeable to plasmid DNA. Due to the damage caused to the cells and DNA the transformation efficiency of biolistics and electroporation is lower than agrobacterial transformation.  Microinjection  Microinjection is where DNA is injected through the cell's nuclear envelope directly into the nucleus.  Sonoporation  Sonoporation uses sound waves create pores in a cell membrane to allow entry of genetic material.  Photoporation  Photoporation is when laser pulses are used to create pores in a cell membrane to allow entry of genetic material.  Magnetofection  Magnetofection uses magnetic particles complexed with DNA and an external magnetic field concentrate nucleic acid particles into target cells.  Hydroporation  A hydrodynamic capillary effect can be used to manipulate cell permeability. = Agrobacterium = A. tumefaciens attaching itself to a carrot cell In plants the DNA is often inserted using Agrobacterium-mediated recombination, taking advantage of the Agrobacteriums T-DNA sequence that allows natural insertion of genetic material into plant cells. Plant tissue are cut into small pieces and soaked in a fluid containing suspended Agrobacterium. The bacteria will attach to many of the plant cells exposed by the cuts. The bacteria uses conjugation to transfer a DNA segment called T-DNA from its plasmid into the plant. The transferred DNA is piloted to the plant cell nucleus and integrated into the host plants genomic DNA.The plasmid T-DNA is integrated semi-randomly into the genome of the host cell. By modifying the plasmid to express the gene of interest, researchers can insert their chosen gene stably into the plants genome. The only essential parts of the T-DNA are its two small (25 base pair) border repeats, at least one of which is needed for plant transformation. The genes to be introduced into the plant are cloned into a plant transformation vector that contains the T-DNA region of the plasmid. An alternative method is agroinfiltration. = Viral delivery = Foreign DNA being transduced into the host cell through an adenovirus vector.Virus mediated gene delivery utilizes the ability of a virus to inject its DNA inside a host cell and takes advantage of the virus' own ability to replicate and implement their own genetic material. Viral methods of gene delivery are more likely to induce an immune response, but they have high efficiency. Transduction is the process that describes virus-mediated insertion of DNA into the host cell. Viruses are a particularly effective form of gene delivery because the structure of the virus prevents degradation via lysosomes of the DNA it is delivering to the nucleus of the host cell. In gene therapy a gene that is intended for delivery is packaged into a replication-deficient viral particle to form a viral vector. Viruses used for gene therapy to date include retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus and herpes simplex virus. However, there are drawbacks to using viruses to deliver genes into cells. Viruses can only deliver very small pieces of DNA into the cells, it is labor-intensive and there are risks of random insertion sites, cytopathic effects and mutagenesis. Viral vector based gene delivery uses a viral vector to deliver genetic material to the host cell. This is done by using a virus that contains the desired gene and removing the part of the viruses genome that is infectious. Viruses are efficient at delivering genetic material to the host cell's nucleus, which is vital for replication.  RNA-based viral vectors  RNA-based viruses were developed because of the ability to transcribe directly from infectious RNA transcripts. RNA vectors are quickly expressed and expressed in the targeted form since no processing is required. Gene integration leads to long- term transgene expression but RNA-based delivery is usually transient and not permanent. Retroviral vectors include oncoretroviral, lentiviral and human foamy virus.  DNA-based viral vectors  DNA-based viral vectors are usually longer lasting with the possibility of integrating into the genome. DNA-based viral vectors include Adenoviridae, adeno-associated virus and herpes simplex virus.  Applications  =Gene therapy= Several of the methods used to facilitate gene delivery have applications for therapeutic purposes. Gene therapy utilizes gene delivery to deliver genetic material with the goal of treating a disease or condition in the cell. Gene delivery in therapeutic settings utilizes non-immunogenic vectors capable of cell specificity that can deliver an adequate amount of transgene expression to cause the desired effect. Advances in genomics have enabled a variety of new methods and gene targets to be identified for possible applications. DNA microarrays used in a variety of next-gen sequencing can identify thousands of genes simultaneously, with analytical software looking at gene expression patterns, and orthologous genes in model species to identify function. This has allowed a variety of possible vectors to be identified for use in gene therapy. As a method for creating a new class of vaccine, gene delivery has been utilized to generate a hybrid biosynthetic vector to deliver a possible vaccine. This vector overcomes traditional barriers to gene delivery by combining E. coli with a synthetic polymer to create a vector that maintains plasmid DNA while having an increased ability to avoid degradation by target cell lysosomes.

It was initially founded in 1985 as the West Nordic Parliamentarian Council of Cooperation but the name was changed in 1997. The council comprises six MPs from each nation appointed by their respective parliaments. The annual general meeting of the council rotates between the members and is its highest authority. The work and activities of the Council are organized by a three- member presidium of which the president of the council is a member. The current (August 2017 to September 2018) president is K√°ri P. H√∏jgaard. The nations of the Council share a somewhat common recent history: Greenland and the Faroes are autonomous territories of Denmark and Iceland is a former Danish possession. They also share a similar economic base, all being dependent on fisheries. The Council's main objectives are: * To promote West Nordic (North Atlantic) interests. * To be guardians of north Atlantic resources and North Atlantic culture and to help to promote West Nordic interests through the West Nordic governments ‚Äì not least with regards to the serious issues of resource management, pollution, etc. * To follow up on the governments' West Nordic cooperation. * To work with the Nordic Council and to be the West Nordic link in Nordic cooperation. * To act as the parliamentary link for inter-West Nordic organisations, including Arctic parliamentary cooperation.Vestnordisk R√•d The West Nordic Council is separate from the Nordic Council, although all of the members of the West Nordic Council are also members of the Nordic Council and there is some cooperation between the two.

The division ensures that Florida is prepared to respond to emergencies, recover from them, and mitigate their impacts. DEM is responsible for the State Emergency Response Team (SERT) which is composed of various intergovernmental entities, volunteers, and the private sector. The division coordinates the efforts of the Federal Government with other departments and agencies of state government, with county and municipal governments and school boards, and with private agencies that have a role in emergency management. The Director is appointed by the Governor of Florida, and serves as an agency head. Jared Moskowitz currently serves as the Director. He was appointed by Governor Ron DeSantis in January 2019. The director oversees the day-to-day operations of the agency, including direct supervision of the functional areas tasked with Preparedness, Response, Recovery, Mitigation, and Finance and Administration. Since 1969 the group, which later became the Division of Emergency Management, was within the Department of Community Affairs. However, pursuant to Chapter 2006-70, Laws of Florida, on July 1, 2006, the Division became a direct reporting entity to the Executive Office of the Governor (EOG) on a full-time basis and is now known as the Florida Division of Emergency Management, or DEM. This allows the Division to report directly to the Executive Office of the Governor (EOG) and keep the same executive and management reporting structure as during an Executive Order and times of emergency.  History  From the 1930s until the mid-1970s, financial assistance to victims of natural disasters came from a variety of federal programs. Recognizing the state's vulnerability to natural disasters, the Florida legislature responded in 1941 by enacting the Florida Civil Defense Council Act, Chapter 202.1.2 Florida Statutes. This Act preceded some ten years of general laws intended to regulate disaster preparedness. The 1941 Act authorized the Governor to establish a State Defense Council by proclamation in times of need or emergency. The Governor appointed members to the Council and served as its chairman. The Council was to perform as a coordinating body for local, state and Federal civil defense activities. Use of existing facilities, and resources was emphasized as well as formation of defense councils at local levels of government. The Council was authorized to establish regional and local councils as well as looking into interplay among emergency services providers. As part of its duties, the Council was to make legislative recommendations to the Governor. Amendments to the law during 1942 left the original intent untouched. In 1943, Florida Statute (F.S.) Chapter 21797 was enacted to deal with wartime civil defense needs. Law enforcement and fire services personnel were authorized to enter private property to enforce blackout, and air raid orders. A separate act in the same year, F.S. 21763, provided for mobilization of fire services to serve the common defense in the event of war. This Act anticipated need for fire services beyond that available in a particular community and specified the rights, powers, and duties of firemen rendering aid outside jurisdictional boundaries. The Florida Civil Defense Act was adopted in 1951. The Civil Defense Advisory Board was created in 1965. The state government was reorganized between 1965 and 1974. In 1969 the Department of civil defense along with the state civil defense council and the Florida civil defense advisory board was transferred to the Department of Community Affairs. The Division of Emergency Government was created within the Department of Community Affairs.Chapter 20.18, Governmental Reorganization Act of 1969 The modern legislation under which Florida Emergency Management is derived was mostly passed between 1974 and 1979. In 1984 the Florida Division of Emergency Management was created from a Bureau within the Division of Public Safety Planning and Assistance. This was based, in part, on a reorganization at the federal level in 1979. In 1992 Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida, revealing the need for a redesign of Florida's emergency management operations. The Department begins recruiting a new leadership team to head its Division of Emergency Management. In March 1993 an unnamed superstorm impacted the entire state causing catastrophic damages in 38 counties.New York Times retrieved June 8, 2008Powerpoint Superstorm analysis retrieved June 8, 2008 The storm demonstrated the vulnerability of Florida to natural disasters and ultimately led to the passage of the Emergency Management Preparedness and Assistance Trust Fund. In 1994 Florida's newly created State Emergency Response Team became operational. For the first time in Florida's history, every state agency had been trained and equipped to work collaboratively during emergencies and to harness their resources to meet the needs of Florida's disaster victims. In 1995 Florida's State Emergency Response Team operations responded when a line of hurricanes and tropical storms battered Florida within months of each other. Among them was Hurricane Opal, one of the ten costliest storms in the nation's history. In 1996 after Hurricane Opal, Florida designed a Regional Hurricane Evacuation Plan intended to ensure a safe, timely and coordinated evacuation of Florida's most populous regions. In 1997, DCA announced a $21 million plan, \\"Breaking the Cycle\\", that was intended to create disaster-resistant communities throughout the state. In 1998, the Legislature authorized the Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Planning Act. This act implemented the Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (1990) amendment. Florida was the only Emergency Management office in the country to seek delegation for this federal program. In 1998 the Division received a federal grant that allowed for the purchase of a NOAA Weather Radio for every public school in Florida. The Broward County Emergency Operations Center in Plantation, Florida, was selected as the state's secondary command center. In 1998 over 12,000 fire and emergency workers battled wildfires over the summer burning nearly 1/2 million acres (2000 km¬≤) of wild and urban lands. This event was called the most \\"complex\\" fire event in history. In 1998 a landmark agreement for mass migration response was signed by Governor Chiles and the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner.Department of Justice News Release retrieved June 8, 2008 On September 5, 2003, the State Emergency Response Team became the first state program in the nation to be fully accredited by the Emergency Management Accreditation Program (EMAP).EMAP In 2004, Florida was struck by a record-setting four major hurricanes: Hurricane Charley, Hurricane Frances, Hurricane Ivan, Hurricane Jeanne and Tropical Storm Bonnie. In 2006, Florida CEM adopted and worked towards statewide implementation of a common operating grid, USNG (civil counterpart to the Military Grid Reference System). This first of its kind leadership had a National impact; other emergency management agencies local, regional, state, and national begin to solve for a considerable deficiency in consequence management, a universal language of location. =Florida Civil Defense Act of 1951= During 1951 the legislature expanded civil defense legislation to include response to and recovery from natural emergencies. This action was in response to lessons learned during a number of hurricanes that threatened or struck the state and an increase in population. The Florida Civil Defense Act of 1951, F.S. 26875, specifically recognized the responsibility of local government in emergency operations. It was consistent with national legislation, the Civil Defense Act of 1950, PL 920, which limited the role of the Federal government in civil defense matters. The Florida Act authorized establishment of a State department of Civil Defense, retaining a council consisting of the Governor and his cabinet to oversee activities of the new department. Although the Department was responsible for coordinating activities, the council retained a position of authority to assume control of operations beyond local capability, entering into agreements with other states, directing local boards of health, and some regional matters. The Council was provided emergency powers in the event of enemy attack. The 1951 Act recognized the importance of the role of local government by directing that each county establish a civil defense council. Cities were authorized to take part in the county council or to establish separate councils. Each local council was authorized to appoint a director responsible for all civil defense functions within that political subdivision. Each political subdivision was authorized to spend funds and enter into contracts to provide for the health and safety of local residents in the event of a disaster. Each local organization was responsible for coordinating its plans with those of the state and Federal governments. The local councils were authorized to make, amend, and rescind orders, rules, and regulations found to be necessary for civil defense, consistent with actions of the state council. Orders, rules, and regulations of either the state or local councils had the force and effect of law when filed with the Secretary of State or local clerk of courts. In the event of a natural disaster, the state council could make available to the affected area any equipment, services or facilities owned or operated by the state or local council. The state and local governments were not liable for damage to persons or property caused by civil defense activity. The legislation prohibited political activity by civil defense organizations. =Civil Defense Advisory Board= In 1965, (Chapter 65-504) a statewide Civil Defense Advisory Board was created to advise the Governor, Council, and Department Director on matters concerning civil defense. A section was also added which conferred on governing bodies of counties and municipalities the authority to declare a state of local emergency within their boundaries. The Governor was given similar power. The local state of emergency was not to exceed 48 hours but could be extended by the Governor. This legislation specifically dealt with emergencies and disasters resulting from natural or accidental causes. During the period of emergency the Governor and political subdivisions could do what was necessary to alleviate suffering and restore public facilities and services. The county civil defense director was charged with coordinating all matters involving civil defense within his county, and with acting as a liaison between the state and other local bodies. =State government reorganization= The state government was reorganized between 1965 and 1974. In 1969 the powers and duties of the Department of Civil Defense were transferred to the newly created Division of Emergency Government in the Department of Community Affairs (Chapter 69-106, Laws of Florida). The legislature also abolished the State Civil Defense Council and the Florida Civil Defense Advisory Board and transferred their functions to the Department of Community Affairs. Violations of provisions of the Civil Defense Act were made second degree misdemeanors. =Modern legislation (1974-1979)= During 1974, Chapter 252, Florida Statutes, was completely rewritten as the State Disaster Preparedness Act, and the Division of Emergency Government was renamed the Division of Disaster Preparedness (Chapter 74-285, Laws of Florida). The 1974 Chapter 252 drafted by the Division of Emergency Government centralized authority at the state level. It reflected the thinking of staff that the effectiveness of the program would be improved by tighter management at the state level. They considered that more was known about \\"good management practices\\" or more effective ways to use emergency resources and funds. A state level organization would also be in a better position to learn more about the program and transmit it to the local level. Centralization would permit detailed standards, planning, and other requirements which the locals would have to comply with to be in conformance with the law.14 This approach was naive and unrealistic as was seen in later developments. The 1974 Act provided the Division with substantial authority to supervise and control all and any problems arising from a disaster and to promulgate rules and regulations having the force of law. The Division was responsible for coordinating state, Federal and local activities. Detailed planning requirements and other prescriptive regulations were subsequently promulgated by the Division which also performed as a clearinghouse for information. There was no provision for local emergency powers. The authority to declare a local state of emergency was rescinded. All emergency powers were retained by the Governor. There was no restraint on political participation. The Act required each political subdivision to create a local organization to support the State's program. The appointment of a local director was subject to state approval. A local director was responsible for coordinating all disaster preparedness functions within the county and serving as liaison with other local organizations. The Governor retained ultimate responsibility for both local and statewide disasters. An amendment to the law in 1977 (Chapter 77-47, Laws of Florida) gave the Governor authority to use mobilize state forces to assist the private sector in clean-up and recovery measures during disaster/emergencies. There was no provision authorizing entrance onto private property. In 1979 further reorganization took place and the Division of Disaster Preparedness became a bureau within the newly created Division of Public Safety Planning and Assistance (Chapter 79-190, Laws of Florida). During 1980 legislation was enacted requiring local agencies to provide for voluntary registration of disabled citizens within the area (Chapter 80-191, Laws of Florida). The purpose of the registration was to determine who would need special assistance in the event of an emergency. The definition of the term \\"disabled\\" was never spelled out and counties were left to their own interpretation. As with other legislation and regulations promulgated during the period there were no provisions to make funds available for implementation. Of some consequence, in response to a challenge of the provisions of the 1974 Act concerning local disaster preparedness directors, the Attorney General (AGO 76-84) rendered an opinion that the director was responsible only to the governing body of the county and the Division of Disaster Preparedness, and could not be placed under supervision of an intermediate county official. This opinion is in consonance with and supported by the stated purpose of the legislation \\"to provide effective and orderly governmental control and coordination of emergency operations in disasters and emergencies.\\" (FS 252.38) This opinion gets to the very basics of emergency management-continuity of government as the bottom line for the entire program. In addition to the immediate physical safety of humans, authority granted to the Florida Governor related to declarations of a state of emergency impacts state operations such as the issuance of development orders and building permits.

He participated in the Cretan and Great Turkish War, as the supreme commander of the Venetian Morlach troops, of which he is enumerated in Croatian and Serbian epic poetry. He was one of the best-known uskok/hajduk leaders of Dalmatia. Life =Origin= Stojan was born in ca. 1636, somewhere in the mountainous Bukovica region in North Dalmatia, modern-day Croatia, presumably in the village of ≈Ωegar, or Zelengrad. The village itself lied above the ≈Ωegar field, from where the population had long \\"jumped into\\" (i.e. guerilla warfare) the Dinara, the Venetian-Ottoman border for centuries. His father was haramba≈°a Janko Mitroviƒá (1613‚Äì1659), another renowned anti-Ottoman rebel in Venetian service, noted commander of the Morlach army in the Cretan War (1645‚Äì1669). Stojan had two brothers (Ilija and Zavi≈°a Jankoviƒá) and a sister Ana. The family of Stojan Jankoviƒá belonged to Serb Orthodox community and their family slava was ƒêurƒëevdan. =Cretan War and peacetime= Stojan began fighting alongside his father and Ilija Smiljaniƒá early on as a fifteen years old, in the Cretan War. Ilija, as the most experienced, was named serdar in 1648 after his own father, Petar Smiljaniƒá had died.Berber (2004), p. 3 In 1650, Stojan begins to receive a payment of 4 ducats, in 1653 the pay is raised to 6. In February 1659, at the Cetina river, both leaders Janko and Ilija Smiljaniƒá succumb to wounds after battling the Turks. The same year, the well experienced 23-year-old Stojan is chosen as leader by the band. As a leader, he constantly takes part in battles in the Frontier. He was known to have defeated several Turkish contingents, and even himself slew the commanders, among which are notable: Ali-beg Durakbegoviƒá, Red≈æep-aga Filipoviƒá, aga Velagiƒá, aga Pajalitoviƒá and Ibrahim-aga Kovaƒçeviƒá.Ba≈°tina dvora Jankoviƒáa (2006), p. 92 In 1666, during fighting near Obrovac, at the Cetina River, where agas Atlagiƒá, ƒåengiƒá and Barakoviƒá fell, he was captured by the Ottomans and spent 14 months in Constantinople as a slave, before escaping and returning home. For his deeds, he was awarded a title and an estate in Ravni Kotari. In the peacetime between the Cretan and Great Turkish War, he was ordered to suppress anti-Ottoman operations in Venetian territory, while in the meantime his brother Ilija left Venetian service and began fighting the Ottomans - this resulted in the brief interrogation of Stojan at Venice. In 1669-1670, Venice awards him 29 ducats monthly, and among other gifts he received a golden ring of St. Mark (becoming a knight of the Order of Saint Mark), and his two sons became captains.Berber (2004), p. 2 He was also given a part of Islam Grƒçki (where was built Kula Jankoviƒáa), but lost it in 1671 with new border negotiations of Mahmud Pasha and Giann Battista. A truce ensured 1670-1684. In 1671 was named as the commander of Ostrovica Fortress. After the death of count Juraj Posedarski, in 1681 became the capo principale di Morlacchi, transl. \\"commander-in-chief of the Morlachs\\", with a monthly pay of 25 ducats.Berber, p. 6 In 1683, his brother Ilija, whom the Venetians failed to implement into their military and since 1680 was banished from Venetian territories because did not respect the Venetian-Ottoman temporary peace on the boundary, instigated a revolt in Dalmatia against the Ottomans, in collaboration with uskoks of Senj revolted with the Venetian and Ottoman Morlachs with the center in Ostrovica. Because of that, Stojan and Zavi≈°a were captured in September of the same year by the Venetians, but Stojan was freed in November. Then the governor-general Lovre Don√† helped Stojan, Smoljan Smiljaniƒá, Soriƒá from Zemunik, and Ivan Dra≈°koviƒá to stop the revolt. =Morean War (Great Turkish War)= In 1684, he returned to the battlefield, liberating Sinj, Lika and Krbava by 1686. In 1685, helped to free Graƒçac and Sinj, participated in operations around Zadvarje, Vrgorac, ƒåitluk and Ljubu≈°ki. In the summer, Stojan with count Fran(j)o Posedarski had brought 300 families with him from Lika to Dalmatia, In July 1686, with Smoljan Smiljaniƒá, commanded 5,000 infantrymen and 1500 horsemen when successfully attacked Livno and Glamoƒç. In the same year, he was allowed to form an overseas military unit in Levant under command of his son Colonel Nikola, as well forming a cavalry unit of Croats (compagnia de Crouati a cavallo) under command of the other son Konstantin. He is credited for the return of the Franciscan order to Sinj, because of which several times charged to Prozor-Rama where were under pressure by Orthodox priests and Ottoman government. During the siege of Herceg Novi, he went with one part of the troops and pillaged the outskirt of Ottoman Tomislavgrad (Duvno), Livno and Glamoƒç, where he was killed on 23 August 1687.Mayhew, p. 72 Venetians wrote of him having \\"bigger heart than mind\\", and his name was famous among Turks and Christians, especially among those of \\"old faith\\", ie. Orthodox. Family He was married twice, first to Vika with whom had three children, sons Alojz (Alvi≈æa, given from the name of godfather Alvisa Contarini, son of governor- general Petar Contarini), Nikola (died 1687 in Levant, or 1688) and daughter Sto≈°ija (Anastazija). He murdered Vika because of alleged jealousy for possible love scam. In 1676 he married second wife Antonia Rezzi (or Reci) of Greek Catholic faith from Zadar, and had sons Josip, Konstantin (d. 1692), Slobodan (d. 1866), Janko (d. 1685), Marko (d. 1686), and daughters Marija (d. 1686) and Magdalena (d. 1684). Six of his children, as well his sister Ana, were recorded in the register of the dead of the Catholic ≈æupa of Zadar Cathedral, implying the family was of Catholic faith. Stojan was awarded a fortification (castle) which had been in the possession of a Turkish landlord named Jusuf Aga Tuniƒá in Islam Grcki, after one of his military victories. This became the Jankoviƒá family home and in 1675 he commissioned the building of a Serbian Orthodox Church here in the name of Saint George (ƒêurƒëevdan was slava of family of Stojan Jankoviƒá). The estate was named \\"Kula Jankoviƒá\\" and Stojan made a legal untaking that it could not be alienated either by marriage, testament or other reason to keep it in the Jankoviƒá family. His sons Nikola and Konstantin died in their military service, and as his descendants did not have any children his branch soon died out. His brother's Ilija (died poisoned in 1692, or 1694) branch also didn't have grandchildren. His sister Ana married to Dmitar Nikoliƒá from Bay of Kotor and had daughter Ana. Brother Zavi≈°a had sons Stojan, Ilija and daughter Jelena. All members of the family received the titles of count by the Doge of Venice Sebastiano Mocenigo in 1705 as the heritage of merit of the father Janko and the godfather Stojan. However, Stojan and serdar Ilija died without direct male descendants and the whole estate was inherited by Jelena who married Venetian colonel Teodor Dede, Orthodox Greek from Heraklion. As according to the original 1670 investiture the estate could not have been alienated by marriage, testament, or other, Teodor took the surname Mitroviƒá, the transfer of the surname, nobility and estate was confirmed by Doge Alvise Pisani in 1739, hence creating a branch of Venetian counts Dede Mitroviƒá. The last count was Ilija Dede Mitroviƒá (great-great-grandson, b. in Zadar 1818, d. in Trieste 1874), whose daughter Olga married Vladimir Desnica, father of Serb writer Bo≈°ko (1886-1945), and grandfather of Vladan Desnica (son of Uro≈°). Bo≈°ko in his archival research had open inclinations toward Serbdom resulting in uncritical translation of Venetian documents (Morlachs became Serbs, family Mitroviƒá became Jankoviƒá, ignored the mention of Croatian language and name), influencing Serbian historiographical viewpoint which considers Morlachs and Uskoks almost exclusively as Serbian and Serbs.Mayhew, p. 18 In folk tradition *He is enumerated in Serbian epic poetry (Ropstvo Jankoviƒá Stojana, Jankoviƒá Stojan i Smiljaniƒá Ilija, Janko kapetan i turski su≈ænji, ≈Ωenidba Jankoviƒá Stojana etc.), as well work Razgovor ugodni naroda slovinskog (1756) by Andrija Kaƒçiƒá Mio≈°iƒá.

It is the first of only four standalone \\"dungeon\\" books created by Hargrave as an extension of his Arduin Multiverse, which at the time of Caliban's publication was known as The Arduin Trilogy. Setting Arduin Dungeon No. 1: Caliban is a scenario for characters levels 8 and up, a four-level dungeon with new monsters and magic treasures and four maps. At 25 pages long, Caliban contained maps with room descriptions and trap matrices, four full dungeon/tower levels with maps and room descriptions (one level is an intricate cavern system), eight pocket sized magic artifact cards and eight illustrated monster cards with statistics. The package also contained a set of 16 unique creature and treasure cards, which could be detached and used in- game and 26 unique new traps in a matrix at the rear of the module. Tome of Treasures :: View topic - Caliban (1979) Cover art was contributed by Greg Espinoza. System While specifically designed for use with the Arduin gaming system, Caliban was usable with any D&D-derived; RPG system. The module was recommended for characters level 12 or higher (in the Arduin universe). History Arduin Dungeon No. 1: Caliban was written by David A.

Companies and software solutions that deal in web-to-print use standard e-commerce and online services like hosting, website design, and cross-media marketing. Partners and customers may submit print jobs, do online pre-press reviews/previews, design things like postcards directly on a website using rich user interfaces, direct cross-media marketing and offer services such as variable data printing, photo printing, booklets, and marketing campaigns. Overview Web-to-print sites are available for commercial users or to the general public. A common offering from print houses is public or private online storefronts or catalogues. Web-to-print increasingly calls for a Portable Document Format (PDF) workflow environment with output provided by digital printing; although there is certainly no requirement that fulfillment be accomplished using digital production equipment; web-to-print is also used today by printers with both offset and digital production facilities. Prepress reviews can be done online, allowing a print house, a client, and possibly a graphic designer to create, edit, and approve computer-based online artwork. Some web-to-print sites offer online print products that replace editing tools like Adobe InDesign where buyers can author work and alter the typeface, copy, images, and layout. These products often include a library of templates for product types, such as post cards, posters, flyers etc. It is frequently possible for clients to upload their own unique content for automated print production. This may be termed Ad Hoc printing. When a digital press is used for the final output, the template usually is transformed into a PDF file that serves as the ‚Äòmaster plate‚Äô for the digital press. In more traditional printing processes, like offset printing, the template is used to create a plate or plates that are used to produce the final printed product. Web-to-print sites often provide approval mechanism so that managers can approve print requests by their employees. Materials produced by a web-to-print process include business cards, brochures, and stationery, among other printed matter, that can be printed in full color or in black and white on various papers and on various presses. Web-to-print systems are also expanding to handle personalization and distribution of other marketing materials such as presentations, seminars, logo items, and even email and other electronic media. This change is driven by enterprise clients seeking a single repository/tool to manage all marketing efforts including print. Comparisons and differences The front-end of the web-to-print process is similar to desktop publishing (DTP) in that individuals or graphic designers use desktop publishing software to create pre-defined templates. These templates are then posted online for later customization by end-users and automated production by a print house or commercial printer. Unlike DTP, web-to-print can bypass the use of traditional design tools by the end-user as the templates utilized in this process are based upon a WYSIWYG (often browser-based) interface that can be edited and approved by a client and by the print house without a graphic designer‚Äôs assistance. Commercial web-to-print applications can include both print on demand (POD) or pre-printed materials that are pulled from inventory. POD documents can have static content or include elements of variable data printing (VDP), a form of POD that is mainly used for personalization of marketing materials with product or customer data that is pulled from a database. VDP is geared toward mass customization, whereas web-to-print focuses only on changes made from order to order. VDP pre-dates web-to-print although at that time the design process was carried out via close collaboration with the printer for documents such as invoices. Origin of the phrase The origin of the phrase \\"web to print\\" is unknown, but an online public example was made by Jim Frew when he used of the phrase in an online article entitled, \\"From Web to Print,\\" for Webmonkey, an online resource for web designers, on 9 February 1999. This article was geared toward web designers who wanted to know more about DTP and the printing process from commercial, technical, and design aspects. However, the trademark for the phrase actually belongs to Belmark, Inc., a label printing company in De Pere, Wisconsin. Belmark was initially granted this trademark in 1999 and renewed it in January 2011. The use of the term \\"web-to-print\\" from the perspective of a transition between web-driven technology to printed matter means that the term \\"web\\" connotes the World Wide Web (WWW), rather than the web that is used as a term for a web rotary press developed by William Bullock. Bullock‚Äôs web press revolutionized newspaper printing, and the WWW is now used to alter how corporations and individuals create commercial and personal printed matter. The term has become ubiquitous, as businesses have picked upon the \\"Web2Print\\" phrase to name software designed specifically to manage the web-to-print process. Graphic design and web design firms that have branched out into print services also use the term to subhead their company trade name, or they use the phrase as a subheading for public relations materials. History DTP‚Äôs history provides the groundwork for current web-to-print expansion, and the onset of e-commerce between 1998 and 2000 created an environment for web-to- print to prosper. However, web-to-print and the framework for it had been well established by commercial developments in some years before this. For instance Xerox Corporation (one of the companies that has been attributed to the origins of the Internet) had a commercial product available for sale in 1995 called InterDoc, which is described as software that allowed printing departments to receive and produce digital file submissions from customers over the Internet.Dhandapani, Mohan, \\"A general model for print delivery of internet documents\\" (1998), chapter 5, On-Line Document Management. Thesis. Rochester Institute of Technology. Accessed from https://scholarworks.rit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6012&context;=theses Advantages and disadvantages Advantages to the use of a web-to-print system include the ability for print houses, graphic designers, corporate clients, and the general public to access a private or public online catalog where last-minute changes to a prepress template are possible. Within this process, the client can approve the materials without the need for a face-to- face meeting with the printer. Additionally, templates allow print customers to control brand management and content, as portions of a constantly used template can remain consistent throughout a series of print projects. Many vendors also utilize workflow managers that combine the connectivity of web- to-print with organization tools that simplify the complex printing process. This system is often cost-effective for clients and time-effective for print houses. The disadvantage to this system as it exists today is that small- to mid-sized print houses and print brokers are limited in their access to software and server system solutions for a web-to-print service offering to clients. To mitigate this, some vendors are using tool editors that allow users to use only the tools that are most important to their business. Most proprietary and trade name software that was developed with web-to-print projects in mind remains prohibitively expensive for this sector. Additionally, these systems often require the use of digital systems that only a larger print house would maintain. Recent developments The main challenge for web-to-print expansion is centered on both the affordability of this solution and software and hardware companies' abilities to converge desktop vector-graphic tools with server technologies designed expressly for a web-to-print goal. While specific software set the stage for major print houses to offer web-to-print services to corporate clients and to the general public, brand name software companies have nudged into this business to offer mid- to high-range solutions. To address the prohibitive cost of traditional web-to-print software solutions (software, systems, periodic software upgrades, technical staff, ...) noted earlier, providers offer web-to-print as \\"hosted\\" or software as a service (SaaS) solutions. Using this model application creation, maintenance, enhancement, technical support, application upgrades, and hosting, are provided as an out-sourced service. Since the software, systems, and support resources are spread over a larger client base, costs can be reduced significantly. This makes it possible for any print house or print broker to offer professional web-to-print applications and services with only a modest investment of time and capital. SaaS solutions are generally delivered through a purely online environment ‚Äî allowing them to take advantage of relatively low cost per seat, cross-platform compatibility, multi-user collaboration, and live database integration for product and digital asset management (DAM). Another option is to find out small and simplified solutions that are able to handle online designing, proofing, quote, invoicing & order management of small & medium size print shop. Another niche in web-to-print solutions that is seen by some as being an indicator of things to come is the provision of WYSIWYG design support. Products provide such ability by allowing elements within a template to be moved, inserted, and deleted by end-users following strict rules established by the administrator of the system. This WYSIWYG generally supported by Adobe Flash technology which gives freedom from browser and OS dependency. This type of system begins to blur the lines between Desktop Publishing applications and web-to-print systems, and lets non-designers edit and proof customized artwork within a 'safe' environment. A new development in the web-to-print world is mobile applications. Followed by the increased usage of smartphones, and the ability to create better software for mobile devices, the ability to use web-to-print services from responsive-design website or even native applications is now available. An inhibiting factor for print companies when it comes to implementing web-to-print are the technical/personnel challenges associated with the deployment of e-commerce storefronts due to a lack of trained resources. This in turn has given rise to a new breed of companies which offer specific consultancy services enabling print companies to expediently execute upon their web-to-print strategy by outsourcing the design and development of their storefronts whilst also gaining a range of associated services such as sales training. Software companies that sell web-to-print solutions are also becoming ever more aware of the need to add value and educate their audiences in respect of web-to-print strategy so as to aid their sales processes, ensuring that once a web-to-print platform is sold, it can also be successfully deployed. Up until 2018, there has been a rise in demand for digital printing and web-to-print in particular. However, experts predict possible instability of growth of web-to-print industry in the years to come due to fluctuations in raw material prices, disadvantages of web-to-print, and limitations of PDF.

A micron (micrometre) is the measurement used to express the diameter of wool fibre. Fine wool fibers have low micron value. Fibre diameter is the most important characteristic of wool in determining its value. Every fleece comprises a very wide range of fibre diameters‚Äîfor example a typical Merino fleece will contain fibres of as low as 10 microns in diameter, and there could be fibres with diameters exceeding 25 microns, depending on the age and health (or nutrition) of the sheep. What is usually referred to as wool's \\"micron\\" is the mean of the fibre diameters or average diameter. This may be measured in a number of different ways. Small samples can be taken from the side or fleece of a sheep and measured using a portable instrument such as an OFDA2000 (Optical Fibre Diameter Analyser); or a mobile instrument system called a Fleecescan. Both these systems have been studied extensively and if used correctly, they should give reasonably reliable results. Pre wool classing micron test results are a useful guide for classers in determining lines of wool to be made. Samples of fleece can also be shorn from the animal and sent to a laboratory for measurement (\\"midside sampling\\"). Most modern fleece-testing laboratories use related instruments to those mentioned‚Äîeither the OFDA models or the Laserscan. Merino stud rams are mid-side sampled and the test results are displayed in the sale catalogues. Once the fleeces are baled and prepared for sale as lots, they are commonly sampled by coring in the broker store and the samples sent to certification laboratories. Here the core samples are cleaned, dried and prepared for measurement under strict test methods. Merino wools are normally measured on Laserscan instruments in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, although OFDA instruments may also be used in some cases (the results from these two types of instrument are quite similar). The ‚Äúcoefficient of variation of fibre diameter‚Äù (CVD) is a measure of the variation in fibre fineness within the sample fleece, relative to the average fibre diameter. Crossbred and coarse wools are often measured for mean fibre diameter by older instruments‚Äî\\"Airflow\\" in many parts of the world, and even a projection microscope in some cases. Weaner and hogget wool is finer and generally more valuable than the wool from older sheep. Most wool between 11.5 and 24 microns in fibre diameter is made into clothing. The remainder is used for other textiles such as blankets, insulation and furnishings. The finest bale of wool ever auctioned sold for a seasonal record of 269,000 cents per during June, 2008. This bale was produced by the Hillcreston Pinehill Partnership and measured 11.6 microns, 72.1% yield and had a 43 Newtons per kilotexKilotex strength measurement.

Maracan√£ Stadium, built for the 1950 FIFA World Cup and officially named after journalist M√°rio Filho (the creator of Copa Rio), was the venue for the matches of the Rio de Janeiro Group of Copa Rio. Pacaemb√∫ Stadium was the venue for the matches of the S√£o Paulo Group of Copa Rio. Ottorino Barassi, a top FIFA administrator involved in the organisation of Copa Rio in 1951/1952, and also of its 1953 successor tournament. Ottorino Barassi, M√°rio Filho and the Brazilian FA organised Copa Rio, envisaging it as a \\"champion clubs-version\\" of the FIFA World Cup. Jules Rimet, founder of the FIFA World Cup and FIFA president in 1950/1951, gave his blessing to the creation of Copa Rio. Stanley Rous, another top FIFA administrator, gave his blessing to both Copa Rio and the 1960 ISL, created along Copa Rio's lines. The Gre-No-Li Trio: Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm. The impossibility to count on their 3 main stars was allegedly the reason for the Italian 1951 champions AC Milan to relinquish participation in the 1951 Copa Rio, ceding their berth to the 1950 champions Juventus. Giampiero Boniperti, often considered the greatest footballer in Italian history, was the main European player at 1951 Copa Rio. In 2007, he gave an interview to Placar, saying that he and his Juventus teammates played the 1951 Copa Rio seeing it as the legitimate Club World Cup.

After declining to participate in the 1951 and 1952 Copa Rio, Scottish champions Hibernian participated in the 1953 cup, and the club refers to themselves as \\"the first British club to play in the World Club Championship tournament in 1953\\".http://www.hibshistoricaltrust.org.uk/honours-records/first-stats Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter has stated to the Brazilian press that, during his tenure in office, FIFA effectively awarded recognition to the 1951 Copa Rio as a legitimate Club World Cup, and therefore to Palmeiras as Club World Champions, a statement that has been disputed by his successor Gianni Infantino. = Creation = The competition was the brainchild of Brazilian sports journalist M√°rio Filho, from Jornal dos Sports newspaper, who envisaged it as a Club World Cup (based on the FIFA World Cup for nations, held in Brazil in 1950) to be permanently held in Brazil, turning (according to him) Rio de Janeiro as \\"world's club football capital city\\". M√°rio Filho put the idea forward in 1950, during the 1950 FIFA World Cup, framing the idea as a possibly promising \\"club version\\" of the FIFA World Cup, having the idea been praised by Jules Rimet, Ottorino Barassi and Stanley Rous, who were in Brazil for the 1950 FIFA World Cup. The Brazilian FA endorsed M√°rio Filho's idea, and organised the competition with a view to creating a Club World Cup. Two top- ranking FIFA officials helped organise the competition, framing the tournament model and helping convince European clubs to participate: Ottorino Barassi and Stanley Rous (the latter having participated only for the 1951 tournament, while the former participated for both 1951-1952 tournaments and also for the 1953 successor tournament, having Barassi come personally to Rio de Janeiro often in 1951 for that reason). FIFA president Jules Rimet made statements praising and bidding good luck to the initiative of the Brazilian FA. The Brazilian FA and press, at the time of the 1951 tournament, dubbed it a \\"Club World Cup\\" or \\"World Champions Cup\\", a label that would later be applied to the Intercontinental Cup (1960‚Äì2004) and the FIFA Club World Cup. = Organisation = The idea was to gather together the reigning champions of the world's top football national leagues, in order to determine the world club champion, following the \\"champions cup\\" model of competitions such as the Latin Cup and the South American Championship of Champions, the same model that would be used in 1955 for the creation of the UEFA Champions League. At first, a 16-club cup was envisaged, following the FIFA World Cup intended number of participants; however, this proposal was soon shortened to an 8-club cup. According to Brazilian newspapers O Estado de S√£o Paulo and Jornal do Brasil, and Spanish newspaper El Mundo Deportivo, the original 8-club plan of the Brazilian FA (organiser of Copa Rio) was to organise the competition with the reigning champion clubs of the Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo state Leagues (the first Brazilian national cup, named Ta√ßa Brasil, was not established until 1959, and the Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo state leagues were ‚Äì and still are ‚Äì the strongest state leagues in Brazil), as well as the reigning club champions from Uruguay, Italy, Spain, England (participants at the 1950 FIFA World Cup, held in Brazil, not to mention the status of Uruguay and Italy as former FIFA World Cup Champions and England as the founders of the sport), Portugal (the Portuguese champions were invited in order to please the huge Portuguese community living in Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo) and Scotland (based on Scotland being as successful as England in the British Home Championship). Some other countries were briefly considered as possibilities (as Sweden, 3rd place in the 1950 FIFA World Cup whose champion Malm√∂ FF was not invited as the club had not pleased the Brazilian football audience in a former visit to the country), but the original plan ended up consisting of a cup with the champions (1950 or 1951) of Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo, Portugal, Spain, England, Scotland, Italy and Uruguay. According to the original plan, countries such as France and Argentina were not to be invited as they did not participate in the 1950 FIFA World Cup (Brazil's and Argentina's Football Associations had severed relations after a brawl in a 1946 match between the two national teams, resulting in the absence of Argentina from the 1950 World Cup and hence from Copa Rio 1951). However, the French side Nice was accepted to the competition following the organizers' failure to bring a Spanish side. Due to the failure to bring teams from Britain, the competition organizers accepted clubs from Austria (at the time, the most successful federation at the Mitropa Cup) and Yugoslavia (the next highest-ranked nation at the 1950 World Cup). In 1952, the Brazilian Football Confederation invited teams from Argentina and West Germany, which were not invited for the 1951 edition of the tournament. Both editions of the competition were contested between eight teams from Europe and South America, divided into two four-team groups, one in S√£o Paulo and the other in Rio de Janeiro, at Pacaembu stadium in S√£o Paulo and Maracan√£ stadium in Rio de Janeiro = Clubs that declined participation = Some clubs were invited to the competition and declined to participate: In 1951: AC Milan (Italy), Atl√©tico Madrid (Spain), Barcelona (Spain) Tottenham (England), Newcastle United (England) and Hibernian (Scotland). In 1952: Juventus (Italy), AC Milan (Italy), Internazionale (Italy), Millonarios (Colombia), Hibernian (Scotland), Newcastle United (England), Barcelona (Spain), Real Madrid (Spain) and Nice (France). Some clubs accepted the invitation to participate in Copa Rio but were not able to do so, while others requested invitations and were denied. In 1951, Mexican club Atlas requested participation and were denied, while the Indian Football Association requested the participation of a representative club and were also denied. In 1952 the Argentinian FA refused to allow its national champion Racing Club to participate, while FC N√ºrnberg (West Germany) were prevented from participating in 1952 due to a West Germany 1950-1952 federal law prohibiting national clubs from participating in tournaments abroad (FC Saarbr√ºcken took its berth, since that law did not apply to clubs from the Saarland Protectorate due to political reasons). In 1952, Dinamo Zagreb (then Yugoslavia, presently Croatia) requested participation and were denied. = Impact in Europe = Among the six countries that would later on dominate European club football, as measured by UEFA Champions League conquests (England, Italy, Spain, Germany, Netherlands and Portugal), two of them were not invited to Copa Rio 1951, as Germany and Netherlands did not participate in the 1950 FIFA World Cup held in Brazil, bearing in mind that back then Netherlands was not yet seen as a relevant football powerhouse, and Germany was then excluded from international football due to the post-War, early Cold War political tension (as were then excluded from international football all the Iron Curtain Countries: Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia). It must be pointed out also that German and Dutch clubs declined participation in the Intercontinental Cup (IC) in the 1970s, perhaps indicating indifference in these countries for intercontinental club competitions. As for the British clubs, both English and Scottish clubs were invited to Copa Rio, having declined participation, and their indifference to play Copa Rio can be paralleled to their indifference to play the Intercontinental Cup in the 1970s or to play the FIFA World Cup in the 1930s. As for the Latin European countries (Italy, France, Portugal and Spain), they entitled priority to the Latin Cup, created by Ottorino Barassi and Jules Rimet and organised jointly by the national associations of the four participating countries. As there was proximity of dates between Copa Rio and the Latin Cup (and the European clubs were obliged to grant vacation to their footballers after the end of the European season), 2 clubs in 1951 (AC Milan and Atl√©tico Madrid) and 3 in 1952 (Barcelona, Juventus and Nice) declined participation in Copa Rio to prioritise the Latin Cup. This can be compared to the fact that, later on, European clubs would entitle to the UEFA Champions League much more importance than entitled to the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. It must be pointed out that, as a competition organised by the Brazilian FA, participation in Copa Rio was non-compulsory for non- Brazilian clubs; the case being different from the IC from the 1980s onwards and the FCWC, in which participation of the UEFA Champions League club champion was compulsory under UEFA and FIFA rules (as an example, Barcelona considered the possibility of not participating in the 1992 Intercontinental Cup, and the contractual obligation with UEFA weighed in for its decision to participate). One Spanish club declined participation in the 1952 Copa Rio in order to play Peque√±a Copa del Mundo in Caracas: Real Madrid CF. In Italy, the only European country that had been champion of the FIFA World Cup by 1951, the 1951 tournament was hailed enthusiastically: the Italian press regarded the competition as an \\"impressive project\\" that \\"was greeted so enthusiastically by FIFA officials Stanley Rous and Jules Rimet to the extent of almost giving it an official FIFA stamp;\\"Corriere dello Sport: Claudio Carsughi - Tra Rio de Janeiro e San Paolo l¬¥avvio del \\"Torneo dei Campioni\\" - p√°gina 3(acervo), 30 June 1951 Describing Juventus's acceptance to participate in the 1951 tournament, the Italian press stated that \\"an Italian club could not be missing in such an important and worldwide-reaching event\\". Giampiero Boniperti, Juventus's main star at Copa Rio 1951 (thus, the main European star in the competition), declared, in a 2007 interview to Placar, that he and his teammates played Copa Rio 1951 seeing it as the legitimate Club World Cup. The competition was also hailed in Portugal as a Club World Cup, with Portuguese champions Sporting Clube de Portugal attending every edition. In at least five European countries (Switzerland,Archive Le Temps, Journal de Gen√®ve, 19/07/1951, page 8, \\"Football: La Coupe des Championnats\\". Austria,Arbeiter Zeitung, 30/05/1951, page 6, \\"Rapid zu schwach f√ºr Rio\\", - Weltmeisterschaft der Fu√üballmeister. Spain,El Mundo Deportivo, 08/06/1951, pag 03.El Mundo Deportivo, 30/06/1951, page 03.Jornal ABC, Madrid, 08/06/1951, pag 17. Portugal, and Italy), the competition was hailed as either \\"Club World Championship/Cup\\" or \\"Champions Cup\\". = Impact in South America = In 1951, the whole Brazilian press (all of the 15 Brazilian newspapers that have been researched on the issue)For details, with the links to the newspaper archives, see the Portuguese language version of this article. The 1951 and 1952 Brazilian newspapers researched on the issue were: Jornal dos Sports, Jornal do Brasil, A Noite, Gazeta Sportiva, Correio da Manh√£, Sport Ilustrado, Globo Sportivo, Mundo Esportivo, Di√°rio - Minas Gerais, √öltima Hora, Di√°rio da Noite, Di√°rio Carioca, Gazeta de Not√≠cias, Estado de S√£o Paulo and Tribuna de Imprensa. hailed the competition as a \\"World Champions Cup\\". In 1951 Vasco da Gama cancelled a trip to Europe in order to play in the Copa Rio, and in 1953 Vasco da Gama declined the invitation to play the 1953 \\"Peque√±a Copa del Mundo\\" in order to play the 1953 Copa Rio-successor-tournament. The reigning Uruguayan champion participated in both editions of Copa Rio, what can be interpreted as a sign of the competition's prestige in that country, the only South American one that had been champion of the FIFA World Cup by 1951. Moreover, the Uruguayan League was interrupted in 1951 in order to allow for its reigning champion Club Nacional de Football to participate in Copa Rio, and in the same year the Uruguayan FA proposed to the Brazilian FA that Uruguay should host the 2nd edition of the tournament. However, in 1952 Uruguayan club Pe√±arol withdrew from the Copa Rio in their semi-final second leg match, resulting in a walkover forfeiture against Corinthians, citing \\"lack of security\\" after their first semi-final match ended in a brawl. One South American club declined participation in the 1952 Copa Rio in order to play Peque√±a Copa del Mundo in Caracas: Millonarios F.C.. = Decline in importance = Still in 1951, the competition received criticism in the Brazilian press, as the quality of participants ended up being far below the original plan, as many clubs declined participation: as the invited British and Spanish clubs declined to participate, and the Italian representative ended up being the second option (for the reigning Italian champion was AC Milan, not Juventus), thus 4 out of the 5 European participants were not part of the original plan, being the Portuguese champion the sole exception (the one club that had been invited not due to football-based criteria, but in order to please the Portuguese-Brazilian community). On the verge of the 1951 Copa Rio, Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S√£o Paulo published an article stating that the following editions of the cup should be called neither \\"World\\" nor \\"Champions\\", for it deserved neither qualifications. The same newspaper also sustained that competitions such as Copa Rio should ideally be organised by FIFA, in dates set and announced by FIFA in due advance, as there was the perception that the dates set by the Brazilian FA for Copa Rio did not fit the interest of the European clubs, thus resulting in a number of them declining to participate. As the final list of 1951 participants turned out to be not of the same quality of the original plan, this fact was also criticized by the Italian press; as an example, Vittorio Pozzo wrote an article criticising Copa Rio for not featuring representatives of Argentina, Scotland and England (the Brazilian newspaper Jornal dos Sports criticised him back, stating that the 1934 and 1938 World Cups won by Italy under Pozzo's guidance did not feature Uruguay, Scotland and England either). Therefore, in June 1951, the Brazilian FA announced that the following editions of the competition (after the 1951 one) were to be hailed only as Ta√ßa Rio, or Copa Rio (Portuguese for Rio Cup), without the label \\"World Champions Cup\\" any more. Besides, as for the 1952 cup, O Estado de S√£o Paulo published an article on the brink of the competition, stating that Uruguayan Pe√±arol was the only really valuable of the 6 foreign participants. Probably as a consequence of these facts, only 3 Brazilian newspapers (amongst 15 researched) referred to the 1952 edition as being a \\"World Champions Cup\\" (compared to all of 15 newspapers researched on the 1951 edition): these were M√°rio Filho's Jornal dos Sports, √öltima Hora (also connected to M√°rio Filho, as his brother headed the sports section) and Di√°rio - Minas Gerais (soon after the 1952 cup, M√°rio Filho wrote an article being sorry that, while in 1951 Palmeiras hailed themselves as club world champions after winning Copa Rio, Fluminense did not regard their 1952 conquest in the same manner). = Extinction = According to the Estado de S√£o Paulo, due to the difficulties in bringing strong European sides to compete in Brazil, the CBD (Brazilian Sports Confederation - then the Brazilian FA) decided that its 1953 intercontinental competition should feature four Brazilian sides and four foreign sides, rather than six foreign sides. The schedule of the 1953 competition (the Torneio Octogonal Rivadavia Corr√™a Meyer) followed this decision; however, the Uruguayan Football Association prohibited Nacional from participating due to the close scheduling of the Uruguayan domestic league, and the club was replaced by Brazilian side Fluminense, as there was not enough time to search for a foreign substitute. Thus the competition included five Brazilian sides and three foreign sides instead. The 1953 competition also saw some clubs being invited and declining to participate. Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany) and Partizan (from Belgrade, Serbia, then Yugoslavia) were invited and accepted to participate but were then uninvited by the Brazilian Sports Confederation. In the case of Rot-Weiss Essen, their invitation followed their German Cup win, and the un-invitation followed a 4‚Äì0 defeat in a friendly match in Essen against America (Rio de Janeiro) (not viewed in Brazil as a top club). Rot- Weiss Essen sued the CBD for financial compensation, taking the case to FIFA (the results of the case are unknown). Despite the competition's new name and different distribution of domestic and foreign clubs, some sources (1953 editions of both O Estado de S√£o Paulo and El Mundo Deportivo) referred to the 1953 competition as the same tournament of 1951‚Äì52, while other sources (RSSSF and 1953 editions of the Jornal do Brasil) treated it as a successor tournament. = Creation of the continent-wide champions cups = The 1951 Copa Rio was one of the \\"champions cups\\" organised by clubs or national football associations, before the 1955 onset of the European Cup, other examples being Copa Aldao, Coupe des Nations, South American Championship of Champions and Latin Cup. In May 1955, FIFA agreed to recognise the European Cup as an official competition only provided that UEFA was its organiser. Thenceforth, international club competitions organised by clubs or national football associations, such as Copa Rio, would decline in importance, being either extinguished or regarded as merely friendly. One attempt was made in 1960 in the USA to create a Club World Cup along the lines of Copa Rio: the ISL; however, in 1960, the Intercontinental Cup came into existence as a UEFA/CONMEBOL-endorsed \\"best club of the world\\" contest, overshadowing the ISL or any other attempt at creating another \\"club world title\\", until the creation of the FIFA Club World Cup.  Status of Copa Rio as a Club World Cup  The status of the competition as a \\"club world cup\\" is heatedly debated in Brazil, as both the 1951 winning club Palmeiras and the 1952 winning club Fluminense regard themselves as the first ever club football world champions. = FIFA = A number of requests for recognition of Copa Rio as an officially recognized \\"club world champion-crowning\\" tournament have been made to FIFA, primarily by 1951 Copa Rio winners Palmeiras and the Brazilian FA (nowadays named CBF- Confedera√ß√£o Brasileira de Futebol). In 2006, Palmeiras prepared a document for FIFA, detailedly describing the 1951 Copa Rio, in order to request official confirmation of their conquest as the first ever club football world championship. The document sustained that the participation of FIFA officials Stanley Rous and Ottorino Barassi in the organisation of the 1951 competition was a clear indication of FIFA's blessing to it in 1951, sustaining that FIFA had assigned Barassi to represent FIFA in the organisation of the tournament (in reality, in a 1951 interview, the FIFA president Jules Rimet, while praising the Brazilian initiative, denied any FIFA involvement or responsibility for it). Rous and Barassi were primarily involved in negotiations with European clubs, while Barassi also helped organize the framework of the competition. Ottorino Barassi participated in the organisation of the competition also in 1952, and in its 1953 successor- tournament, though only through telephone contact, with no evidence that he came to Brazil personally in 1952 and 1953 as he did several times for the 1951 edition, for example having been present in Brazil for its final match. In May 2007, Palmeiras received a letter from FIFA, signed by then Secretary- General Urs Linsi, recognizing Palmeiras as club world champions of 1951. However, this decision was later withdrawn by FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who declared that the matter was still being evaluated. On April 26, FIFA announced that the procedure to make this decision had not been completed yet, and that the issue had been dealt with only at administrative level, by the General-Secretariat, though, given the importance of the matter, it should be submitted to the FIFA Executive Committee. In December 2007, FIFA declared that the first Club World Cup was played in 2000, thus not recognizing the Copa Rio as an FIFA event. In April 2013, in communication to then Brazilian Minister of Sports, Aldo Rebelo, then FIFA General-Secretary, J√©r√¥me Valcke, again recognised Palmeiras as champions of the \\"first Club World Cup ever held\\" (but the decision was temporary pending that of the executive committee, as it happened in 2007). In 2014, the FIFA Executive Committee recognized Palmeiras as champions of the \\"first worldwide club competition\\" (as written in the document). On July 22, 2016, FIFA celebrated the 65-year anniversary of the 1951 Copa Rio title won by Palmeiras. On instagram, FIFA posted: \\"Green is the color of envy. 'The Big Green' were the envy of the wide world # On this day 65 years ago. A Liminha-inspired Palmeiras edged a Juventus team including Giampiero Boniperti & a Danish triumvirate to become the sport's first intercontinental world club champions. 100,000 watched that at the Maracan√£. One million flooded the streets of S√£o Paulo to welcome their heroes home\\". (as written in the post). A distinction between a \\"worldwide competition\\" (worldwide in reach but that does not necessarily indicate the world champion) and a \\"competition awarding the label of world champion\\" rose in January 2017, when FIFA issued the following statement, whereby FIFA mentioned both Copa Rio and the Intercontinental Cup as examples (by using the expression such as) of competitions whose existence FIFA hailed as positive: \\"At its meeting in Sao Paulo on 7 June 2014 the FIFA Executive Committee agreed to the request presented by CBF to acknowledge the 1951 tournament between European and South American clubs as the first worldwide club competition, and Palmeiras as its winner. FIFA acknowledges and values the initiatives to establish worldwide club competitions throughout history. This is the case of tournaments involving European and South American clubs, such as the pioneering Copa Rio, played in 1951 and 1952, and the Intercontinental Cup. However, it was not until 2000 that FIFA organised the maiden FIFA Club World Cup, with representatives from all six confederations. The entity is clear when stating that the 1st world champion is Corinthians. The Rio and Intercontinental Cups are simply called \\"world level\\" tournaments. As far as FIFA official documents are concerned, in October 2017 FIFA changed its long-standing position on the Intercontinental Cup and officially recognised (with official FIFA Council approval) all its champions (from 1960 to 2004) as club world champions. Both Intercontinental Cup and FIFA Club World Cup winners are listed as world champions in the FIFA Club World Cup Statitical Kit, FIFA's official document on its club world competition, with the aforementioned recognition being expressly mentioned in all annual editions of the said document since 2017. Copa Rio has never been mentioned in this document since its supposed FIFA- recognition in 2014, prompting controversy in Brazil on the extent to which FIFA recognised, or did not recognise, Copa Rio. cfr. In April 2019, FIFA president Gianni Infantino, interviewed by the Brazilian media, reiterated the perspective that only the winners of the Intercontinental Cup and the Club World Cup are officially recognised world champions: \\"We have already decided to give the title of world champion to everyone who has won the Cup between Europe and South America since 1960. 1951 is a little further back\\"; \\"The world title of Palmeiras... For miracles, you have ask another, not me...\\". Also in April 2019, former FIFA president Joseph Blatter (who held office until December 2015) stated to the Brazilian press that Palmeiras was effectively recognised by FIFA in 2014 and thus should be regarded as club world champions (but without specifying whether officially or symbolically). Since 2007, the extent of FIFA's recognition to Copa Rio has turned into a matter of controversy in Brazil. Although the Copa Rio was unquestionably created in order to determine the \\"club world champion\\" and Palmeiras was celebrated in this manner in Brazil in 1951 (as proved by the 1951 Brazilian newspapers), the competition fell short of the aim of representing the best of European and South American football, as can be seen in the list of invited clubs that declined to participate. Brazilian clubs Fluminense and Corinthians declared in 2007 that they would follow suit in case Palmeiras was successful about the 1951 Copa Rio, and therefore they would ask FIFA recognition for their titles of 1952 (Fluminense's Copa Rio) and 1953 (Corinthians's Peque√±a Copa del Mundo), with other clubs following suit later on (Bangu's 1960 ISL, Botafogo's Caracas trophies 1967-1970), thus prompting speculation that recognition of Copa Rio 1951 might propel other clubs to make similar \\"recognition requests\\" for other competitions, thus creating a \\"free-for-all\\" of requests, mainly on competitions held in the 1950s, before the onset of the Intercontinental Cup in 1960 as a UEFA/CONMEBOL-endorsed \\"best club of the world\\" contest.

He participated in the Cretan War (1645‚Äì69), alongside Ilija Smiljaniƒá, as the supreme commanders of the Venetian Morlach troops, of which he is enumerated in Serb epic poetry (as Janko of Kotari, –à–∞–Ω–∫–æ –æ–¥ –ö–æ—Ç–∞—Ä–∞). His son, Stojan Jankoviƒá, followed in his father's footsteps. Life Janko was the son of Mitar (born c. 1585), whose family hailed from village Zelengrad or ≈Ωegar in the area of Bukovica. Janko had brothers Jovan, Stjepan, Pavle, and Andrija, and probably was among the youngest brothers. Vukadin Mitroviƒá was also a haramba≈°a in Venetian service, possibly another brother, or a cousin. Mitroviƒá in 1646 was recorded as a defender of ≈†ibenik, and in 1649 was rewarded with a monthly payment of 4 ducats. Stojan, who was Janko's eldest son, began fighting alongside him and Ilija Smiljaniƒá early on, in the Cretan War (1645‚Äì69). Ilija, as the more experienced, was named serdar in 1648 after his father, serdar Petar Smiljaniƒá had died.Berber, p. 3 In 1648, when the Ottoman army took their village, the Mitroviƒái and 70 other ≈Ωegar families settled in the small village of Budin near Posedarje, under Venetian control. In January 1654, with 100 horsemen and 150 other soldiers prevented Ottoman's destruction of Posedarje for which was rewarded by the authorities. After the death of Filip Smiljaniƒá, in 1656 was named as a serdar. Under his command were people of Ra≈æanac, Vinjerac, Ljubaƒç, Posedarje, Novigrad, Krmpoƒáani, as well controlled two cols at Old Obrovac In February 1659, at the Cetina river, both leaders Janko and Ilija Smiljaniƒá succumb to wounds after battling the Turks. He was buried on 28 February 1659 in the Catholic church of St. Elias in Zadar, until mid-18th century part of the Catholic ≈æupa of Zadar Cathedral in which register of deaths (1651‚Äì1667) was recorded. Janko's wife was Antonija, and they had three sons, Stojan, Ilija and Zavi≈°a, and a daughter Ana.Berber, p. 6 According to one document, stating that they had many people of the same confession faithful to the Roman Church, it is argued that they were Roman Catholics. Notes These theses are based on Croatian sources that are often biased, and is not debated amongst inter ethnic and international scholars. On the contrary most of the historic sources speaks of the Mitroviƒá family being of Serbian heritage. This is also backed up with the fact that the Mitroviƒá family was Serbian Orthodox and Janko's son Stojan in 1675 commissioned the building of a Serbian Orthodox Church in the name of Saint George (ƒêurƒëevdan was slava of family of Stojan Jankoviƒá).

The original building was designed by architects Raymond Hood and John Mead Howells in the Art Deco style, and was erected between 1928 and 1930. A later addition was designed by Harrison & Abramovitz and built between 1957 and 1960. The Daily News Building consists of a 36-story tower that is tall, as well as two shorter additions extending east to Second Avenue. Its architectural features include a large granite entrance at 42nd Street and an expansive lobby inside. The original structure is an L-shaped building that faces 41st Street to the south, Second Avenue to the east, and 42nd Street to the north, with a longer frontage on 41st Street than on 42nd Street. The newer addition is along 42nd Street and Second Avenue, giving the modern building a rectangular lot. The Daily News Building was commissioned by Joseph Medill Patterson, the founder of the New York Daily News. The design incorporates a layered massing that contains several setbacks at higher floors. It was Hood's first modern freestanding tower and one of the first large Art Deco buildings in New York City. The Daily News Building was occupied by the Daily News until 1995, after which it was converted to office use. Upon its completion, the Daily News Building received mixed reviews, and many observers described the building as having a utilitarian design. The Daily News Building was made a National Historic Landmark in 1978. It was designated a New York City Landmark in 1981 and its interior was similarly designated in 1998.  Site  The Daily News Building is at 220 East 42nd Street in East Midtown, on the south side of the street between Third Avenue and Second Avenue. The building site is bounded by 42nd Street to the north, Second Avenue to the east, 41st Street to the south, and a private alley called Kempner Place to the west. The New York City Subway's Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street station (), the Chrysler Building, and the Socony‚ÄìMobil Building are one block west, while Tudor City and the Ford Foundation Building are one block east.  Design  The Daily News Building was designed in the Art Deco style by architects Raymond Hood and John Mead Howells, and was commissioned as the headquarters of the New York Daily News, which at the time was owned by Joseph Medill Patterson. It was among the first skyscrapers to be built without an ornamental crown. This was in contrast to Hood's earlier designs for the Tribune Tower in Chicago and the American Radiator Building in Manhattan.; Harrison & Abramovitz designed additions to the building, which were constructed between 1957 and 1960. Hood designed the building with practical needs in mind, saying that \\"I do not feel that The News Building is worse looking than some other buildings\\". Hood wrote that both the owner and architect had agreed that \\"the most simple and direct way to get an effective exterior\\" was to colorize its features. Hood stated that the window design was largely chosen based on its perceived utility, because the interior space would have needed to be easily divided into offices. However, other critics stated that horizontal strips of windows would have also worked for such a purpose. The upper floors were designed as lofts separated only by movable partitions. = Form = The massing was influenced by the requirements of the 1916 Zoning Resolution. The 36-story tower, built between 1928 and 1930, is on the northern portion of the site, facing 42nd Street, and contains several setbacks on all four sides. On the northern elevation is one large setback at the 9th floor.The larger setbacks are two bays deep, and the smaller setbacks are one bay deep. Each bay corresponds to the width of one column of windows. Where applicable, the locations of each setback correspond to the floor above the setback. The western elevation has multiple smaller setbacks. The southernmost ten vertical bays of the western facade are set back at the 9th floor, while the following two bays to the north are set back the same distance above the 15th floor, creating a zigzag effect. The southern elevation contains small setbacks at the 7th and 13th floors, as well as larger setbacks at the 27th floor and above the 36th floor. The eastern elevation does not contain any setbacks, except for the northernmost seven bays, which protrude slightly below the 33rd floor. The southern portion of the Daily News Building, near 41st Street, is shorter than the tower and formerly served as the printing plant. It was also built in 1928‚Äì1930 and initially contained nine stories. An additional five stories were built in the late 1950s, and are set back from the original structure. An 18-story annex, also built in the late 1950s, runs on the northeastern portion of the plot, facing Second Avenue and 42nd Street. The original structure consisted of of space, and the annex had ; including an additional above the original printing plant, the complex had a total of . = Facade =  Tower  Main entrance in 2008 The facade of the tower is composed of vertical window bays that are separated by \\"irregularly placed\\" sections of white brick wall, as well as multicolored brick patterns and red curtains. The spandrel panels between the windows on each story are made of reddish-brown and black brick. The spandrel panels at lower floors contain geometric patterns, while those on upper floors have been simplified into horizontal bars. On floors with setbacks, the panels also contain miniature setbacks. The vertical bands were similar to that used at Patterson's house at 3 East 84th Street, an Art Deco building that Hood had also designed. The tops of the vertical bands terminate abruptly at the setbacks. At the base of the tower, on the 42nd Street side, is a three-story-tall granite-clad main entrance that takes up the width of five bays. Over the entrance is a carving of the phrase \\"\\", below which is a large bas-relief with carvings of people and the phrase \\"\\". The latter quotation, attributed to Abraham Lincoln, referenced the \\"common people\\" to whom the Daily News was intended. There are glass pylons on either side of the entrance, which are topped by bronze ornamentation and contain horizontal bronze strips. There are smaller entrances leading to storefronts on either side of the main entrance. Above these storefronts are bronze friezes, which are overlaid at specific intervals by the bottom portions of the white brick walls that are present on the upper stories. The bronze friezes and white brick walls wrap around the building above the first story. A granite inscription from Patterson is present on the western side of the building, and the southern facade of the tower has five loading docks. At the top, the facade is designed so that it appears to have no architectural decorations. The parapet walls extend above the roof to conceal the elevator rooms and the maintenance penthouses on the roof. Hood had initially been uncertain about how to design the top stories. According to one account, architect Frank Lloyd Wright visited Hood and advised him to \\"just cut the top off\\". Walter Kilham, who had assisted Hood, later recalled that Wright retracted his suggestion after Kilham confronted Wright.  Other portions  The facade of the original printing plant on 41st Street is similar to that of the tower, though the bays are grouped in sets of three. Each grouping is separated by wide white-brick piers, while the groupings of windows are internally subdivided by narrower piers. There are friezes above the first and second floors, as well as six loading docks on 41st Street. The annex's design echoes the vertical stripes of the original design, except with a wider stripe. Like the original building, the window bays each contain one window per floor. The facade has light-and-dark-red brick spandrels between the windows on each floor. The piers between each bay are decorated by slightly-projecting white-brick piers with aluminum sheathing. The facade of the printing-plant addition is designed in the same manner. = Lobby = The lobby of the Daily News Building, circa 1941 The lobby of the building includes a circular rotunda with a black glass domed ceiling near the 42nd Street entrance. Under this ceiling in a stepped pit was the world's largest indoor globe, conceived by the Daily News as a permanent educational science exhibit. The globe is in diameter, with over 3,000 individual features, There is also a large compass on the floor, as well as bronze floor etchings within the terrazzo floor, with the names of major cities and their distances from New York City. The walls have nineteen panels designed by J. Henry Weber, which depict maps, weather charts, and clocks from different time zones. The Daily News Building's main elevator lobbies are to the south of the rotunda and contain bronze plaques memorializing Daily News employees who fought in major wars. The rotunda was inspired from the Glass Pavilion by Bruno Taut, and the recessed center specifically was inspired by the tomb of Napoleon at Les Invalides. Accounts differ on who had the most influence on the lobby's design. According to Daily News historians, Patterson was the first to propose the idea of the lobby.; Hood's biographer conversely implied that the idea had not come from Patterson, who had supposedly been skeptical of the design with a globe. As originally configured, the rotunda was approached from the 42nd Street entrance to the north, as well as from a hallway on the southwest. The hallway led to two banks of elevators to the south, as well as a restaurant, and there were two storefronts flanking the rotunda, one each to the west and east. The elevator lobbies had bronze grilles and other decorations designed by Rene Paul Chambellan in the Art Deco style. There were eighteen glass exhibits, which were part of a scientific and educational display designed by James H. Scarr, a U.S. Weather Bureau meteorologist.; During the expansion, the storefronts on either side of the rotunda were removed and incorporated into the main lobby. The glass showcases of the original lobby were replaced with the wall panels. The city names were changed to reflect new distances and spellings, and a hallway was extended to the entrance on Second Avenue. History = Context = The Medill family published numerous large newspapers in the United States in the early 20th century, including the Tribune Media conglomerate. One family member, Joseph Medill Patterson, founded the Daily News in 1919 as the United States' first daily tabloid.; While the Daily News was not an immediate success, it became the city's largest newspaper by 1925, with a daily circulation of over a million. The Daily News was originally based at 25 City Hall Place in the Civic Center of Lower Manhattan, moving in 1921 to a five-story building nearby at 23 Park Place. By 1927, the latter building had become insufficient for the Daily News operations.; The Daily News then started to look for new locations, following the example set by The New York Times and New York Herald, which had previously moved north to Midtown Manhattan from Lower Manhattan. According to the newspaper's research manager Harry Corash, the city's population was centered in Queens, east of Midtown Manhattan across the East River.; = Planning and construction =  Planning  The site ultimately chosen was on East 42nd Street; the section east of Grand Central Terminal and Lexington Avenue had yet to be developed, and the Daily News historians called the area \\"a row of old, assorted, unpretentious structures\\".; Patterson said that the 42nd Street location was ideal, as it was on the same street as Times Square, where the rival Times headquarters were incidentally located. The Daily News bought a tract of land facing 41st and 42nd streets, between Second and Third Avenues on February 3, 1928, for $2.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). At the time, the building was being envisioned as a 20-story structure. Eleven days later, the Daily News bought the lots at 41st Street and Second Avenue, which collectively comprised . Patterson selected Hood and Howells as architects for the new building. The pair had previously won the competition to design the Tribune Tower, the headquarters of the Chicago Tribune, which was owned by Patterson's cousin Robert R. McCormick. Hood had first proposed the Daily News Building as a tower. To get Patterson to acquiesce to the tower plan, Hood framed the plan as an \\"efficient\\" business decision and prepared numerous models for possible buildings, concluding that the most efficient one was a skyscraper of between 35 and 40 stories. On the west side of the building was the Commercial High School, which the New York City Board of Education was planning to tear down. The Daily News and the Board of Education each agreed to cede toward a pedestrian walkway, which would make the Daily News Building freestanding on most of its frontage, but only the Daily News section of the walkway was built, as the high school remained standing until the late 20th century. One of Hood's other plans, which would have set back the tower above the third story to create a rising effect, was rejected by Patterson since it would have eliminated usable office space allowed under the zoning restrictions. Another plan to use a limestone facade was scrapped due to cost, and brick was instead. Hood subsequently carved a plastic model of the building, which incorporated a tapered design. Construction 1941 sketch Blueprints were filed with the Manhattan Bureau of Buildings in June 1928; at the time, the building was to be composed of 36 stories and would cost $6.6 million (). In addition to the Daily News itself, the new structure would contain Tribune subsidiaries that were related to the paper's function. The ceremonial cornerstone, filled with relics of the Daily News owner Tribune Media, was laid in September 1928. Construction of the steel frame had been finished in August 1929. By late 1929, the Daily News Building was almost complete. The rival Times described the project as one of several high-rise developments that were \\"radically changing the old-time conditions\\" along East 42nd Street. The other developments along that section included the Lincoln Building, Chanin Building, Chrysler Building, and Tudor City. In November 1929, several mechanics were given craftsmanship certificates for \\"outstanding work\\" on the Daily News Building's construction; at that point, the Daily News Building was 75% rented. The Daily News started moving into the building in mid-1930 and the lobby opened to the public on July 23, 1930.; The building, including the newspaper's new printing presses, had cost $10.7 million (). = Early use and expansion = The New Yorker observed that the office space at the Daily News Building was designed \\"at factory prices\\", which was part of the reason why Patterson had selected Hood as an architect.; The lobby was popular and had 625,000 visitors a year by 1938. The Daily News rented out the space in the building that it did not utilize. For example, American Locomotive Company subsidiary Alco Products took space in the structure, as did the Ahrens Publishing Company, the Museum of the Peaceful Arts, and a branch of the National City Bank of New York. In addition, United Press International moved its headquarters to the Daily News Building in 1931. Daily News affiliate WPIX also took space in the building, broadcasting from its mast until 1951. In the late 1950s, as part of a $20 million expansion of the Daily News facilities (equivalent to $ million in ), Harrison & Abramovitz were hired to design an expansion to the building and renovate the existing facilities. The project increased the amount of space in the building by over 50% to . The additions were to be used by both the Daily News and the building's other occupants. Turner Construction was hired for the annex's construction. Work started in May 1957, and excavation on the annex started later that year. By April 1959, the facade of the annex had been completed. The lobby was also renovated under the guidance of Daily News president Francis Marion Flynn. The new structure was completed in June 1960, and by that August, the expanded building was 90% rented. The globe in the lobby was restored in a 61-week project that took place between 1966 and 1967. = Later use = Sign for WPIX on the Daily News Building By the 1970s, the Daily News and the International Paper Company were the main occupants of the Daily News Building; when the latter moved out in 1978, the vacant space was quickly occupied. By 1981, Tribune Media was attempting to sell the Daily News with limited success. Media and real-estate concerns projected that the building might be worth $150‚Äì250 million (equivalent to $‚Äì million in ); several commentators suggested that the Daily News could be shuttered to free up office space, though others pointed out that relocating the printing presses would also free up space in the building. Tribune Media sold the Daily News Building to a partnership in December 1982. The La Salle Street Fund held a majority ownership stake in the partnership, while New York News Inc. held the minority stake. As part of the sale, the printing and distribution operations were moved to other facilities in the New York metropolitan area. In 1984, the Daily News removed its printing presses from the building, freeing up of vacant space that was converted to office space. The Daily News started looking for new locations after media executive Mortimer Zuckerman bought a stake in the newspaper in 1993. The next year, the Daily News announced it would move its remaining operations within the Daily News Building to a single facility, 450 West 33rd Street in Chelsea, Manhattan. The relocation was motivated by the cost of maintaining several spaces, as well as the fact that the lease was about to expire and the Daily News operations in the building had been downsized since the early 1980s. Further, the Daily News circulation had decreased by two-thirds from its peak in the 1940s, and the number of employees had been reduced more than 85%. The Daily News moved out during May 1995. The next year, developer Steve Witkoff bought the Daily News Building and leased most of the building's vacant space, thereby qualifying the building for a $140 million mortgage. The Omnicom Group signed a lease for a majority of the building's space in 1997, making it the building's main tenant. SL Green Realty bought the Daily News Building in 2003 for $265 million. By January 2019, SL Green considered selling the property, and in October 2019, developer Jacob Chetrit made an offer of $815 million for the building. However, the sale was scrapped in March 2020 after Deutsche Bank withdrew its financing as a result of economic uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020, SL Green refinanced the building after having secured a $510 million mortgage; despite the COVID-related financial difficulties, the Daily News Building was almost fully leased . Tenants The building contains the former Daily News TV broadcast subsidiary WPIX, channel 11, which later became an affiliate of The CW network. It was also home to WQCD, the smooth jazz station The News had operated as WPIX-FM. The Visiting Nurse Service of New York occupies in the Daily News Building, and the nonprofit Young Adult Institute takes up within the building. Other tenants include the United Nations Development Programme and UN Women, as well as the New York office of public relations firm FleishmanHillard.  Impact  = Critical reception = Daily News Building, rendered by Hugh Ferriss The Daily News historians wrote in 1971 that \\"the building did a lot for the paper\\".; The Daily News referred to it as being among Hood's \\"triumphs\\", though most of the paper's praise for the building was directed toward the lobby. In 1931, the Daily News published an editorial in rebuttal to modern architecture, saying that the design was focused on the \\"efficient production of newspapers.\\" At the time of the building's opening, the Daily News praised the lobby as having a state-of-the-art exhibit. Architectural critics had mixed opinions of the design. According to English architect Frank Scarlett, who looked at the model of the building, it was one of several contemporary designs that deviated from the eclectic style that had been popular until the early 20th century. The New Yorker, profiling Hood in 1931, said that the Daily News Building was \\"a distinctly untraditional building\\" and that Hood's design had been \\"daringly successful\\". After Hood's death in 1934, critics and the media described Hood as \\"utilitarian\\" in his designs. The New York Times said that the Daily News Building's design made him \\"practically a complete functionalist\\". Contemporary modernist architect Harvey Wiley Corbett said in Architectural Forum that the building was a \\"right about-face [...] from the former eclectic approach\\". The following year, Architectural Forum lauded the building's exterior for being utilitarian and praised the lobby as \\"romantic and dramatic\\"., cited in Other critics viewed the Daily News Building as architecturally lacking. Architectural historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock and architect Philip Johnson perceived the building's design to have sacrificed functionality for effectiveness, saying that the \\"crisp square termination\\" on the roof \\"is a deception\\". A similar sentiment criticizing the roof was expressed in the New York Herald Tribune obituary of Hood. Nevertheless, prior to his death, Hood had disregarded the building's \\"architectural beauty\\" and \\"composition\\", instead focusing on its \\"effect\\". One early appraisal of the Daily News Building called the facade \\"almost nothing but a series of stripes\\", which the reviewer deemed to be artistic.; Another praised the lobby exhibit as being \\"a genuine contribution to architecture\\". Later reviews of the building compared it with the contemporary architecture. One guidebook, published in 1952, stated that the building had an \\"asymmetrical, almost picturesque\\" shape. Another book in 1960 perceived the tower's freestanding nature as its most appealing quality. Further reviews in the 1970s described the building as having deviated from popular architectural styles of the time, and being a modern skyscraper that was easily distinguishable from \\"mediocre metal-and-glass neighbors\\". Architectural writer Eric Nash said in 1999 that \\"Hood did not romanticize the skyscraper as a carved mountain\\", unlike contemporaries such as Ralph Thomas Walker or Hugh Ferriss. The rival New York Times called the Daily News Building \\"one of America's great newspaper buildings\\", in contrast with its own previous headquarters at 229 West 43rd Street. =Landmark designations= The Daily News Building's exterior was designated a New York City Landmark in 1981, and its first-floor interior was similarly designated in 1998. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, in granting the exterior landmark status, called it \\"one of the city's major Art Deco presences\\". It became a National Historic Landmark in 1989. Only the original tower and printing plant are part of the National Historic Landmark and New York City Landmark designations. =Media depictions= Hugh Ferriss drew a rendering of the Daily News Building in 1930. The rendering inspired the design of the fictional Daily Planet headquarters in the Superman franchise. During July 1977, the Daily News Building was used for filming exterior scenes at the Daily Planet in the 1978 film Superman: The Movie. At the exact moment of the 1977 New York City blackout on July 13‚Äì14, the building's facade was serving as the set for the upcoming release of Superman: The Movie. During the blackout, film crews lent their Klieg lights to Daily News editors so that the following day's issue could be published.

His career as a director continued until the 1950s and he made more than 40 feature films in total. During the 1950s and 1960s, he worked on cultural programmes for French television. He also fulfilled many administrative roles in the French film industry, and he was the founder and the first President of the French film school Institut des hautes √©tudes cin√©matographiques (IDHEC). Early life Marcel L'Herbier was born in Paris on 23 April 1888Some reference sources erroneously give L'Herbier's date of birth as 1890. The correct date is confirmed in his autobiography, La T√™te qui tourne, p.16. into a professional and intellectual family, and as he grew up he demonstrated a multi-talented disposition for sports, dancing, debating and the arts. He attended a Marist school and then the Lyc√©e Voltaire, followed by the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes Sociales in Paris.Marcel L'Herbier, La T√™te qui tourne. Paris, Belfond, 1979. p.16-17. He worked hard at his education and by 1910 he had obtained his licence en droit, a qualification to practice law. He went on to study literature, and in his spare time he learned harmony and counterpoint with Xavier Leroux, with the ambition of becoming a composer. Another ambition was to join the diplomatic service.Jaque Catelain, Jaque Catelain pr√©sente Marcel L'Herbier. Paris, Vautrain, 1950. p.8. An early romance with the future dancer Marcelle Rahna ended in sensational publicity when she fired a revolver at him and then at herself. Both survived, but L'Herbier lost the use of a finger.Jaque Catelain, Jaque Catelain pr√©sente Marcel L'Herbier. Paris, Vautrain, 1950. p10. In 1912 he met Georgette Leblanc, the companion of Maurice Maeterlinck, and under her influence he started to write plays, poetry and criticism, and made many contacts in literature and the theatre. His idols were Oscar Wilde, Paul Claudel and Claude Debussy.Roy Armes, French Cinema. London: Secker & Warburg, 1985. p.44. The outbreak of war in 1914 changed L'Herbier's world. He withdrew from social life, and being unable to join the army immediately because of his injured hand, he went to work in a factory making military uniforms. He went on to serve with various auxiliary units of the armed forces and towards the end of the war in 1917-1918 he was by chance transferred to the Section Cin√©matographique de l'Arm√©e, where he received his first technical training in film-making. His intellectual conversion to the medium of film had only recently occurred, firstly through a friendship with the actress Musidora (he recalled that she took him to Cecil B. DeMille's The Cheat (1915) which awakened him to the artistic possibilities of silent films)Marcel L'Herbier, La T√™te qui tourne. Paris, Belfond, 1979. p.19-21. and subsequently through encounters with the critics Louis Delluc and √âmile Vuillermoz who were developing their own theories of the new art form. Silent films While still in the army, L'Herbier wrote two film scenarios for other directors, and then accepted an official commission to make a propaganda film about the image of France, which was funded by L√©on Gaumont. He produced Rose-France (1918), a highly original and poetic film using many experimental camera techniques, which proved too fanciful for many but which established his reputation as a talented innovator. After making another more commercial film for Gaumont, Le Bercail (1919), he was offered a two-year contract with the company which gave him the means to choose more ambitious projects. On Le Bercail, he worked for the first time with the actress Marcelle Pradot who subsequently appeared in most of his silent films and whom he married in 1923.Marcel L'Herbier, La T√™te qui tourne. Paris: Belford: 1979. p.123. Between 1919 and 1922, L'Herbier made six films for Gaumont, several in their S√©rie Pax, and three of these stood out as major achievements of his period in silent films. He adapted a story by Balzac for L'Homme du large (1920), set and filmed on the Brittany coast. More ambitious was El Dorado (1921), a grand and visually spectacular melodrama filmed on location in Andalusia; it was noted for its visual experiments with dissolves and blurred images (\\"flous\\" in French). Tensions between L'Herbier and Gaumont were resolved into the project Don Juan et Faust (1922), also filmed partly in Spain; but when the film went over-budget, L'Herbier was unable to complete it as planned, and the resulting work was appreciated more for its technical mastery than for its intellectual confrontation of two literary archetypes. After this, L'Herbier felt the need to seek his creative independence and he founded his own production company, Cin√©graphic, which produced his next six films. L'Herbier's first production with his own company was an adaptation of Resurrection (1923) from the Tolstoy novel, but filming met a series of setbacks and the project was abandoned when L'Herbier contracted typhoid and was critically ill for several weeks. Later in 1923, L'Herbier was persuaded by Georgette Leblanc-Maeterlinck to consider a project in which she would star, and which would also attract some American finance; this developed into L'Inhumaine (1924), one of the most ambitious films of L'Herbier's career, in which he collaborated with leading figures from other art forms, including Fernand L√©ger, Robert Mallet-Stevens and Darius Milhaud. A striking visual spectacle was built around a fanciful plot, and the result proved highly controversial among audiences and critics alike. L'Herbier had discovered the work of the playwright and novelist Luigi Pirandello during 1923 and was eager to introduce his ideas to the cinema. He chose the novel Il fu Mattia Pascal, and was delighted when Pirandello's mistrust of filmmakers was overcome and he agreed for the first time to the filming of one of his works,. The film Feu Mathias Pascal (1925) featured the expatriate Russian actor Ivan Mosjoukine in the leading role, and it became successful with critics and the public. In spite of his successes, Cin√©graphic was steadily losing money, and for his next film L'Herbier chose a more popular and straightforward subject, Le Vertige (1926), filmed in the south of France, which was a commercial success. This was followed by Le Diable au c≈ìur (1928), a maritime drama set in the fishing port of Honfleur, and featuring the English actress Betty Balfour; this was the first French feature to be shot on panchromatic film. The next and final Cin√©graphic production (in collaboration with Soci√©t√© des Cin√©romans) was another large-scale project, L'Argent (also 1928), an adaptation of Zola's novel of the same name, transposed from the 1860s to the then present day. With an international cast, art deco design, and some spectacular location filming in the Paris Bourse, L'Argent was a substantial work which effectively marked the end of silent film-making for L'Herbier. He had been responsible for some of the period's most innovative developments in his own films, and he also provided support to other filmmakers such as Louis Delluc, whose final film L'Inondation (1923) was financed by Cin√©graphic. He also gathered around him a group of regular collaborators, including Claude Autant-Lara, Philippe H√©riat, and Jaque Catelain (who became his lifelong friend and appeared in twenty of his films).According to the critic No√´l Burch, Marcel L'Herbier and Jaque Catelain had a homosexual relationship. No√´l Burch, \\"Ambivalences d'un r√©alisateur 'bisexuel': quatre films de Marcel L'Herbier\\", in Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma, sous la direction de Laurent V√©ray. Paris: Association Fran√ßaise de Recherche sur l'Histoire du Cin√©ma, 2007. pp.201-216. Sound films After a transitional film, ', shot as a silent picture but given a complete soundtrack of music, songs and sound- effects, L'Herbier undertook L'Enfant de l'amour (1929), which, like many other early ventures in sound film, was an adaptation of a stage play. This was the first fully talking picture to be made in a French studio. In addition to the technical problems presented by the heavy new sound cameras, L'Herbier was also required to make the film simultaneously in three different language versions (French, English and German) which meant that several actors had to be used in some of the roles. The film was sufficiently successful to attract other similar offers, but L'Herbier felt the loss of his independence of action, and after making two detective films based on books by Gaston Leroux, ' (1930) and ' (1931), he withdrew from film-making for two years and returned to writing. In 1933, fearing that he was losing touch with the film business, he returned to make several more versions of stage plays, L'√âpervier, Le Scandale and L'Aventurier, all of which enjoyed commercial popularity but gave little scope for the kind of cinematic invention that he sought. L'Herbier's most successful film of the 1930s was Le Bonheur (1934), (\\"a miraculous conjunction of talents\\"N.T. Binh, \\"Le Bonheur: la plus belle mise en abyme\\", in Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma, sous la direction de Laurent V√©ray. Paris: Association Fran√ßaise de Recherche sur l'Histoire du Cin√©ma, 2007. p.272. \\"...une miraculeuse conjonction de talents dont Marcel L'Herbier ne retrouvera pas souvent l'√©quivalent.\\"), adapted from a play by Henri Bernstein, with Charles Boyer and Gaby Morlay in the leading roles. During filming, L'Herbier was injured when a camera fell on him, and he consequently lost the sight of one eye. He began a court action against the producers Path√©, claiming their civil responsibility, and the eventual judgment of the case (1938) in his favour recognised for the first time in French law the right of the director to be considered as an author of his film, rather than merely as an employee of the company. This marked an important stage in L'Herbier's lifelong battle for greater recognition of filmmakers as creative artists.N.T. Binh, \\"Le Bonheur: la plus belle mise en abyme\\", in Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma, sous la direction de Laurent V√©ray. Paris: Association Fran√ßaise de Recherche sur l'Histoire du Cin√©ma, 2007. p.265. Between 1935 and 1937, L'Herbier directed seven features, including a trio which were characterised by their patriotic spirit, Veille d'armes (1935) (depicting the French navy), Les Hommes nouveaux (1936) (Mar√©chal Lyautey's pacification of Morocco), and La Porte du large (1936) (the navy again). Made during a period of intense political conflict between the left and the right in France, these films, by L'Herbier's own admission, represented a split in his own politics, which set his socialist sympathies against his impatience with the anti-militarism of the Front Populaire.Marcel L'Herbier, La T√™te qui tourne. Paris: Belfond, 1979. p.251. After trying to revive his own production company, this time under the name Cin√©phonic, to produce some short documentaries, l'Herbier tried to develop more satisfactory material for himself in a series of dramatised histories which he called \\"chroniques film√©es\\". The three which he completed before the outbreak of World War II were La Trag√©die imp√©riale (1938), about Tsar Nicholas II and Rasputin, Adrienne Lecouvreur (1938), filmed at the UFA studios in Berlin, and Entente cordiale (1939), which used the life of Edward VII to demonstrate the affinities between France and Britain; (its premi√®re in April 1939 took place in the wake of the German invasion of Czechoslovakia). The outbreak of war in 1939 did not immediately interrupt L'Herbier's film-making, and in the spring of 1940 he was at the Scalera studios in Rome shooting a long-cherished project, La Com√©die du bonheur, but the imminent entry of Italy into the war alongside Germany forced him to return to France before the film was fully completed (though it was subsequently released). After the German occupation of France in 1940, L'Herbier worked with other filmmakers to salvage the French film industry and to protect the jobs of its technicians. He went on to direct four films before the Liberation, the most successful of which was La Nuit fantastique (1942). This \\"realistic fairy tale\\"Marcel L'Herbier, La T√™te qui tourne. Paris: Belfond, 1979. p.284. was very different from the prevailing style of French film production, and it allowed him to return to the style of visual experimentation which had characterised his silent films - to which he could now add innovative uses of the soundtrack. It did much to restore his critical reputation at least temporarily. In the post-war period, L'Herbier made one further return to the \\"chronique film√©e\\" with L'Affaire du collier de la reine (1946), but otherwise his remaining films as director were fairly conventional literary adaptations, and his creative career in the cinema concluded with Les Derniers Jours de Pompei (1950) and Le P√®re de mademoiselle (1953). In the 35 years since his d√©but in 1918, he completed 14 silent and 30 sound feature films. Television As his career as a director for the cinema faded in the post-war years, Marcel L'Herbier transferred his energies to the relatively new and undeveloped medium of television. He was interested in what made television distinctively different from cinema, and he wrote articles developing the idea that each medium had its own aesthetic.E.g. \\"L'Ogresse t√©l√©vision\\", Le Monde, 22 septembre 1950; \\"Pass√© d'un art futur\\", Le Monde, 10 f√©vrier 1951. Whereas for L'Herbier the cinema was a creative art-form, television was a medium for recording, for reproducing, for disseminating to a wide audience; television would not kill the cinema - on the contrary it could be the means of deepening the public's understanding of cinema. In the years 1952-1969, L'Herbier produced over 200 television broadcasts on cultural subjects, acting as presenter of most of them. Although he devoted some programmes to classical music and historical biography, most of his work explored aspects of the cinema. He presented eight series of programmes which combined critical discussion and interviews about cinema with extracts from films, and sometimes the transmission of a complete film that had been featured in the discussion. He also directed five television plays which were mainly transmitted live. He was the first established filmmaker to work in French television, and he brought to the task an evident seriousness of purpose and concern for its educational possibilities.Michel Dauzats, \\"Marcel L'Herbier, un pionnier de la t√©l√©vision\\", in Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma, sous la direction de Laurent V√©ray. Paris: Association Fran√ßaise de Recherche sur l'Histoire du Cin√©ma, 2007. p.327-332.Dominique Moustacchi, \\"Un cin√©aste engag√© au service du petit √©cran\\", in Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma, sous la direction de Laurent V√©ray. Paris: Association Fran√ßaise de Recherche sur l'Histoire du Cin√©ma, 2007. p.333-343. Administration In addition to his creative work, L'Herbier undertook a number of administrative roles in the French film industry. From 1929 he was the secretary general of the Soci√©t√© des auteurs de films which sought to establish greater recognition for the authorial rights of filmmakers. In the mid-1930s L'Herbier supported the view that the national film industry needed stronger and more coordinated organisation if it was to defend itself against foreign competition, and he was instrumental in setting up a union for various categories of film employees, the Syndicat g√©n√©ral des artisans de film, soon renamed as the Syndicat des techniciens de la production cin√©matographique, of which he became the secretary in 1937, and subsequently president in 1939. The union achieved improvements in rates of pay, hours of work, and insurance arrangements for accidents at work, as well as press accreditation for film journalists. The union could also speak with one voice for all aspects of the industry. After the war L'Herbier continued his lobbying for French cinema by chairing the Comit√© de d√©fense du cin√©ma fran√ßais.Mireille Beaulieu, \\"Le r√¥le central de Marcel L'Herbier dans la structuration des syndicats de l'industrie cin√©matographique\\", in Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma, sous la direction de Laurent V√©ray. Paris: Association Fran√ßaise de Recherche sur l'Histoire du Cin√©ma, 2007. p.285-294. During the Occupation, L'Herbier was among those who accepted the reality of the German victory and set about creating the best conditions for the continuity of French life and French cinema. In this role he became almost a spokesman for the Vichy government on matters relating to the cinema,Jean A. Gili, \\"De l'occupation √† la lib√©ration: Marcel L'Herbier et la naissance de l'IDHEC\\", in Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma, sous la direction de Laurent V√©ray. Paris: Association Fran√ßaise de Recherche sur l'Histoire du Cin√©ma, 2007. p. 299. contributing an article on \\"Cin√©matographe\\" to a quasi-official publication on the state of France and its future in 1941.France 1941. La R√©volution nationale constructive. Un bilan et un programme. Paris: Alsatia, 1941. pp.292-314. In March 1941, L'Herbier was elected president of the Cin√©math√®que fran√ßaise, but his plans for major reorganisation soon brought him into conflict with its secretary and founder Henri Langlois. Langlois found L'Herbier too autocratic and L'Herbier found Langlois too disorganised. L'Herbier continued as president until 1944, when he was finally outmanoeuvred by Langlois, and he was replaced by Jean Gr√©millon.Jean A. Gili, \\"De l'occupation √† la lib√©ration: Marcel L'Herbier et la naissance de l'IDHEC\\", in Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma, sous la direction de Laurent V√©ray. Paris: Association Fran√ßaise de Recherche sur l'Histoire du Cin√©ma, 2007. pp. 309-310. L'Herbier's major contribution to the reshaping of the French film industry was the establishment of a French national film school, something which he had been arguing for over many years. In the wartime conditions, he found that there was government support for the project, and in 1943 the Institut des hautes √©tudes cin√©matographiques (IDHEC) was established in Paris. L'Herbier became its first president in 1944 and held the position until 1969. IDHEC offered training for directors and producers, cameramen, sound technicians, editors, art directors and costume designers. It became highly influential, and many prominent filmmakers, including some from outside France, received their training there.Jean A. Gili, \\"De l'occupation √† la lib√©ration: Marcel L'Herbier et la naissance de l'IDHEC\\", in Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma, sous la direction de Laurent V√©ray. Paris: Association Fran√ßaise de Recherche sur l'Histoire du Cin√©ma, 2007. p.305-309. Writings Throughout his career, Marcel L'Herbier was a prolific author on the subject of the cinema. He wrote over 500 articles for magazines and newspapers,\\"Bibliographie des √©crits et entretiens de Marcel L'Herbier\\", in Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma, sous la direction de Laurent V√©ray.

One of the themes that he regularly addressed was the concept of authorship in film-making and the need to establish the rights of film authors over their creative work. Another important topic was the distinctive national character of French cinema and the threat to it posed by the unrestricted import of foreign productions. In 1953 he helped to establish the Cin√©ma section of the newspaper Le Monde. Before his film career began, L'Herbier published a volume of poetry: ...au jardin des jeux secrets (Paris: Edward Sansot, 1914); and a play: L'Enfantement du mort: miracle en pourpre noir et or (Paris: Georges Cl√®s, 1917). In his final year, he published an autobiography, La T√™te qui tourne (Paris: Belfond, 1979); [the title translates as \\"the head that spins/shoots a film\\"]. Marcel L'Herbier died in Paris on 26 November 1979 at the age of 91. Reputation In 1921, only three years after his first film, Marcel L'Herbier was voted by readers of a French film magazine as the best French director. In the following year, the critic L√©on Moussinac marked him as one of the filmmakers whose work was most important for the future of cinema.Laurent V√©ray, \\"Introduction\\", in Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma, sous la direction de Laurent V√©ray. Paris: Association Fran√ßaise de Recherche sur l'Histoire du Cin√©ma, 2007. p. 9. In this period, L'Herbier was linked with filmmakers such as Abel Gance, Germaine Dulac and Louis Delluc as part of a \\"first avant-garde\\" in French cinema, the first generation to think spontaneously in animated images.Richard Abel, French cinema: the first wave 1915-1929. Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1984. p. 279 The acclaim which he earned in the 1920s contrasts markedly with the relative neglect of his later work. Even in the silent period, there were those who found his work mannered and marred by an aestheticism unlinked to the subjects of his films. In the 1930s and 1940s, his public roles and sometimes his political associations were interpreted to his disadvantage by some. However, in France his continued presence in so many aspects of the film industry until the 1960s ensured that he was not forgotten. More recently there have been re-issues and re-evaluations of both his silent and sound films and a growth in critical attention to his work. In the English-speaking world, in the early 21st century L'Herbier remains a largely unknown figure. Screenings of his films have been rare, as have DVD re-issues, and very little of the critical literature about him has been available in English. Standard film histories however confirm the lasting significance of his contributions to silent cinema, particularly in El Dorado, L'Inhumaine, and L'Argent.For example, Roy Armes, French Cinema.

It was once known as Orange Bay or Baie L'Orange. Orange Bay or Great Harbour Deep was a French fishing station and it had appeared on Samuel de Champlain's map of 1612 as Baye dorge.

It cost the province $3.8 million to relocate the residents, according to government documents. That $3.8 million was recovered in four years, through savings in services which were no longer necessary once the town was shuttered. Those services included the local school and ferry that linked the town to Jackson's Arm. However, the $3.8 million total does not include any pending or future settlement amounts. Although the $3.8 million was no longer spent on/in Great Harbour Deep, the province still incurred education and medical expenses related to those residents now settled in other towns. In 2018, Baccalieu Media Inc produced a one-hour documentary about the resettlement of this town for CBC's Absolutely Canadian documentary series called \\"Great Harbour Deep\\", profiling town residents before the move, and revisiting the ghost town and the residents 15 years later.

The youngest child of William and Mary (Harwood Stockett) Alexander, he attended St. John's College in Annapolis and graduated in 1827 at the age of fifteen. Personal life After graduating from St. John's College in 1827, he spent the next four years reading law privately, but apparently he did not take the bar exam. He, instead, chose to begin working for the Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad. Alexander also attended medical lectures in Baltimore, though he did not receive a degree in Medicine. Alexander married Margaret Hammer on June 4, 1836, in Baltimore. They had at least two sons, the second one born in Baltimore in October 1838. Throughout his life Alexander maintained close ties with his older brothers, William (born circa 1803) and Thomas Stockett (born 1801.) The brothers shared a deep devotion to the Whig party, and William often sent Alexander detailed accounts of the actions of the House of Delegates in Annapolis. Alexander was active in the congregation of St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Baltimore, and wrote a concordance to the Book of Common Prayer as well as two volumes of religious poetry. Business experience As part of his work for the Baltimore and Susquehanna railroad, Alexander performed surveys and made maps of the route. This experience, combined with his academic achievements, led to Alexander's 1833 appointment as the Chief Engineer of Maryland. He was charged with the task of creating a complete map of Maryland. While carrying out his surveys for this task, Alexander located several canal route proposals including Zekiah Swamp and the richest coal deposits in the state. Frustrated with needing to divert his mapping assignment for internal improvement projects, he resigned from his position as Maryland's official cartographer. He then joined with a friend, P.T. Tyson, Esq., to found the George's Creek Iron and Coal Company. By the time Alexander resigned his state position in 1837, the company's success had made him financially secure. Professional titles Alexander held a wide variety of professional appointments over his lifetime. He served as Chief Cartographer of Maryland, geologist of Maryland, and in 1857 was appointed Commissioner to England to work on creating an international system of weights and measures. Alexander also was professor of civil engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and professor of physics at the University of Maryland. Notable works He published a number of works including his report on a new map of Maryland (1835), a treatise on international coinage of Great Britain and the United States (1857) and an opinion on the location of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in Wheeling, Virginia (1850). He edited a treatise on leveling and Sims' treatise on mathematical instruments (1838), used in surveying, leveling, and astronomy (1835). He was a fellow of the American Philosophical Society, and a member of the Geographical and Statistical Society and the Maryland and Pennsylvania Historical Societies. In 1847, he was elected an honorable member of the Belle Lettres Society at the College of St. James in Hagerstown, Maryland. References *Who Was Who in America: Historical Volume, 1607-1896.

He was most notable for his research and writing on integrated marketing communications (IMC). Education and early career Schultz earned a Bachelor of Business Administration from University of Oklahoma in 1957, a master's degree in advertising from Michigan State University in 1975, and a PhD in mass media from Michigan State in 1977. Schultz began his career in publication sales and management. In 1965, he joined the firm of Tracy-Locke Advertising and Public Relations based in Dallas, Texas, where he gained skills in advertising and marketing communications. Academic career In the mid-1970s, Schultz began teaching advertising at the Michigan State University and in 1977, he joined the faculty at Northwestern University, where he became department chair and associate dean.Medill University, \\"Don E. Schultz,\\" Biographical Notes, In 1991, Schultz was part of a team at the Medill School of Journalism, Northwestern University which in conjunction with the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA), began the first empirical study designed to investigate how integrated marketing communications was being used by practitioners.Schultz, D. and Kitchen, P., \\"Integrated Marketing Communications in US Advertising Agencies: An Exploratory Study,\\" Journal of Adaertising Research, Vol. 37, no, 5, 1997, pp.7-17 The study focused around understanding the concept and the importance of IMC and also to analyze the extent in which IMC was practiced in all major U.S advertising agencies. When this initial study was replicated by other studies in a number of countries; New Zealand, UK, US, Australia, India, Thailand, South Africa and the Philippines, etc.,Kliatchko, J.G., \\"Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC),\\" International Journal of Advertising, Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, pp. 8-9; Ichul, L., Han, D. and Schultz, D., \\"Understanding the Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications,\\" Journal of Advertising Research, Vol. 44, No. 1, 2004, pp 31-45 they demonstrated that the new IMC was far from a \\"short-lived managerial fad\\" but rather was \\"a very clear reaction by advertising agencies and their clients as they are affected by a multitude of factors such as new forms of information technology including development and usage of databases, media fragmentation, client desires for interaction/synergy, and global and regional coordination.\\"Kitchen, P.J. and Schultz, D.E. \\"A Multi-Country Comparison of the Drive for IMC.\\" Journal of Advertising Research,Vol. 39, No. 1, 1999, p. 21; Shimp, T.A.

E., Tannenbaum, S.I. and Lauterborn, R.F., Integrated Marketing Communications: Putting it together and making it work, Lincolnwood, Ill., NTC Business Books, 1993 Their work, simply entitled, Integrated Marketing Communications, described IMC as a totally new way of looking at the whole of marketing communications, rather than looking at each of the parts separately. Also in 1993, Schultz and the Medill School at Northwestern University changed their curriculum to include a focus on this new idea of integrated marketing communications rather than the traditional program which had emphasized advertising.Percy, L.,Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications, Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, pp 6-7 Often referred to as the \\"father of integrated marketing\\",Northwestern University, Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award, April 12, 2010 Schultz was the author or co-author of 28 books and 150 trade/academic articles on marketing.Medill University, \\"Don E.

Its membership is restricted almost entirely to alumni and faculty of Yale University. With a clubhouse comprising 22 stories, the Yale Club has a worldwide membership of over 11,000. Upon opening in 1915, the building became the largest clubhouse in the world and continues to be the largest college clubhouse in existence. Clubhouse Vanderbilt Avenue The club is located at 50 Vanderbilt Avenue, at the intersection of East 44th Street, across Vanderbilt Avenue from Grand Central Terminal and the MetLife Building. Four other clubs affiliated with Ivy League universities have clubhouses in the surrounding neighborhood: the Harvard Club of New York, the Princeton Club of New York, the Penn Club of New York City, and the Cornell Club.\\"The Old Yale Club; Make Way for the Blue and Gold,\\" The New York Times, July 9, 1989 The neighborhood also includes similar clubs not affiliated with universities, like the New York Yacht Club and the University Club of New York, as well as the flagship stores of Brooks Brothers, J. Press, and Paul Stuart, which traditionally catered to the club set.\\"The Season; Tickling the Ivy,\\" The New York Times, September 19, 2004 The building is a New York City designated landmark. The 22-story clubhouse contains three dining spaces (the \\"Tap Room,\\" the \\"Grill Room,\\" and the Roof Dining Room and Terrace), four bars (in the Tap Room, Grill Room, Main Lounge, and on the Roof Terrace), banquet rooms for up to 500 people like the 20th floor Grand Ballroom, 138 Guest Rooms, a library, a Fitness and Squash Center with three international squash courts and a swimming pool, and a barber shop, among other amenities. The heart of the clubhouse is the main lounge, a large room with a high, ornate ceiling and large columns and walls lined with fireplaces and portraits of the five Yale-educated United States presidents, all of whom are or were members of the Yale Club: William Howard Taft, Gerald R. Ford, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.\\"The Painter And the President,\\" The New York Times, November 9, 2003, Outside the lounge above the main staircase hangs a posthumous portrait of Elihu Yale by Francis Edwin Elwell. History =Early history= The roots of the club reach back to 1868 and the foundation of the Old Yale Alumni Association of New York. In response to the association's desire for a permanent clubhouse, it formally established the Yale Club in 1897. One of the incorporators was Senator Chauncey Depew, whose portrait by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury painted in 1890 hangs in the building. The first president of the Yale Club was attorney Thomas Thacher, founder of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. The first clubhouse was a rented brownstone at 17 East 26th Street. Thereafter, in 1901, the club built and opened a new, twelve-story clubhouse at 30 West 44th Street, which today is home to the Penn Club of New York. The current clubhouse opened in June 1915, designed by architect and Yale alumnus James Gamble Rogers in conjunction with the construction of Grand Central Terminal. It was largely paid for by money raised or contributed by President George C. Ide of Brooklyn (whose portrait by George Burroughs Torrey also hangs in the building). It purposely was situated on the very corner where Yale alumnus Nathan Hale was hanged by the British Army for espionage during the American Revolution.\\"Yale Club Had but One Hale to Lose,\\" The New York Times, January 19, 1995 Today, the site of Hale's execution is disputed. According to the Ken Burns documentary Prohibition, the Yale Club was able to stock up enough liquor to see the club through the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. =21st century= Heisman Trophy which was awarded to USC Trojans quarterback Carson Palmer at the Yale Club in 2002. In July 1999, the Yale Club became the first of New York's Ivy League university clubs to change its dress code to business casual, a move which upset some members and was received with polite scorn from other clubs. Today, the dress code remains business casual, except in the athletic facilities. In the fall of 2012, the club began to allow denim to be worn in the library, the Grill Room, and on the rooftop terrace during the summer, but nowhere else, as long as it is \\"neat, clean, and in good repair.\\"Carole Bass, \\"At Yale Club of NYC, Yale blue now includes denim ‚Äî sometimes,\\" Yale Alumni Magazine (Aug. 27, 2012) Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Heisman Trophy, traditionally presented at the Downtown Athletic Club, was presented at the Yale Club in 2002 and 2003.68th Heisman Trophy Okla. QB Jason White Wins Heisman Trophy The 2002 winner was quarterback Carson Palmer of the USC Trojans, and the 2003 winner was quarterback Jason White of the University of Oklahoma Sooners. Before the two Heisman Trophy ceremonies, the un-awarded trophy itself was displayed in the Yale Club's lobby, flanked by portraits of Yale's two Heisman winners, end Larry Kelley (1936) and halfback Clint Frank (1937). In June 2007, former United States Solicitor General and onetime Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork sued the club in federal court. Bork alleged that, while trying to reach the dais to speak at an event for The New Criterion magazine, he fell because the club negligently failed to provide steps or a handrail between the floor and the dais. Bork claimed that his injuries required surgery, immobilized him for months, forced him to use a cane, and left him with a limp. He sought judgment for $1 million in damages plus punitive damages and attorney's fees. In May 2008, Bork and the club reached a confidential, out- of-court settlement. Membership To be eligible for election to membership, a candidate must be alumni, faculty member, or full-time graduate student of Yale University. The club also offers legacy memberships for any Yale- affiliated member's children. The club sends out a monthly newsletter to all members. Yale College did not allow women to become members until 1969.\\"High and Dry At the Yale Club?\\" The New York Times, November 5, 2000 Wives of members even had to enter the club through a separate entrance (today the service entrance), and were not allowed to have access to much of the clubhouse.\\"Vote of 35-to-15 Lets Women Join 6,000-Member Yale Club,\\" The New York Times, July 31, 1969 Once Yale opened to women, however, the club quickly followed suit on July 30, 1969, although the club did not open its bar, dining room, or athletic facilities to women until 1974\\"Women's Privileges Widened at Yale Club,\\" The New York Times, June 15, 1974 and did not open its swimming pool (known as \\"the plunge\\") to women until 1987.\\"Yale Club Lets Women Take 'the Plunge,'\\" The New York Times, October 7, 1987 Now, though, women constitute a large percentage of the club's membership. Three other, smaller clubs also are in residence at the Yale Club: the Dartmouth Club, the Virginia Club, and the Delta Kappa Epsilon Club. Members of these other clubs have the same access to the clubhouse and its facilities as members of the Yale Club itself. According to a book published for the club's 1997 centennial, members at that time included George H. W. Bush, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Gerald Ford, John Kerry and George Pataki. Among others were architect Cesar Pelli and author David McCullough. Today, the Yale Club has over 11,000 members worldwide.

There are a number of stories of brothers fighting in the same battles on opposite sides, or even of brothers killing brothers over the issues. The term Brother Against Brother is also the name of a popular rules set for miniature wargaming recreations of Civil War skirmishes. Examples * December 26, 1861, Confederate Lt. Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest was ordered to probe the strength of Union troops in and around Camp Calhoun, Kentucky. Two Confederate forward scouts, Adam R. Johnson and Robert M. Martin, each had brothers stationed at the camp.The Battle of Sacramento Battlefield history - Address of local history site: P.O. Box 245  Sacramento, KY 42372 * On May 23, 1862, at the Battle of Front Royal, Capt. William Goldsborough of the Confederate 1st Maryland Infantry captured his brother Charles Goldsborough of the Union 1st Maryland Infantry and took him prisoner. The battle is also notable for being the only time in United States military history that two regiments from the same state with the same numerical designation have engaged each other in battle. *The Crittenden brothers were brigadier generals on opposite sides of the conflict: George Bibb Crittenden within the Confederate Army and Thomas Leonidas Crittenden within the Union Army. In 1861, George was promoted to brigadier general on August 15 and briefly commanded a brigade in the Army of the Potomac before he was assigned the District of East Tennessee in November. Crittenden briefly commanded the 2nd Division of the Army of Central Kentucky, but was relieved of duty and arrested for drunkenness on March 31, 1862. * The Terrill brothers were also brigadier generals on opposite sides of the conflict: James Barbour Terrill VMI Civil War Generals Biographical information from the VMI archive within the Confederate Army (killed at the Battle of Totopotomoy Creek) and William Rufus Terrill within the Union Army (killed at the Battle of Perryville). * On November 7, 1861, at the Battle of Port Royal, Union Navy Commander Percival Drayton of the USS Pocahontas battled Confederate forces on shore commanded by his brother General Thomas F. Drayton. * As cited in the book, \\"A Century of Wayne County, Kentucky\\", brothers Anthony and William McBeath fought on opposite sides of the Civil War, Anthony for the Confederate Army, and William for the Union Army. At the end of the war, both brothers returned home the same evening, William in a \\"resplendent uniform of a Major in the Federal Army\\", and several hours later, Anthony in \\"rags with a 'taterhill' hat.\\" Johnson, A. P. (1939). A Century of Wayne County Kentucky, 1800-1900. The Standard Printing Co.: Louisville, KY, p.32 and p.166-167. *On June 16, 1862, Brothers James and Alexander Campbell fought each other on opposite sides of the Battle of Secessionville, which was the first major attempt by federal troops to regain Charleston. James and Alexander Campbell were brothers from a Scottish family that immigrated to the United States in the 1850s. Confederate James Campbell joined a militia company in Charleston known as the 42nd Infantry Regiment, which consolidated with other troops into the Charleston Battalion. In New York, Alexander joined the 79th Highlander regiment. They were within yards of each other, but were unaware of that fact until near the end of the battle. The Battle of SecessionvilleIn May of 1863, brothers John and Henry McLaughlin fought on opposite sides at the Siege of Vicksburg. Both McLaughlin brothers were born in Marion County, Indiana. John McLaughlin enlisted with the Union army, achieving the rank of colonel by the end of the war. Henry enlisted in the Confederate Army as a private and was promoted to second lieutenant. In the battle the Siege of Vicksburg, Henry was captured and sent to a Union military prison. *The Terrill Brothers came into conflict at the Confederate victory at Hartsville, TN in 1862. George W. Terrill, Joshua C. Terril, Simeon F. Terrill, and Robert Q. Terrill originated in Boone County, KY. George W. Terrill fought with the 5th KY Cavalry, Company G, along with his brothers Joshua and Simeon. Robert Q. Terrill was a first lieutenant in the Kentucky Volunteer U.S. Infantry, 11th Regiment. At the Confederate victory at Hartsville, TN in 1862, the 5th KY Cavalry took 1,844 Union prisoners and wagons of supplies. One of these prisoners was Robert Terrill.

Located in the south of Ireland at Waterford, it forms the Outer Ring Road around the south of the city. As of December 2006 it commences on the Old Kilmeaden Road at Knockhouse Lower, west of Waterford City and ends at a junction with the R683 on the Dunmore Road in the south-east of the city. The R709 forms the Inner Ring Road around the south of the inner city. Background Waterford City Council initiated work on the outer ring road in 1993. Phase one of the outer ring road, between the Dunmore Road and the Williamstown Road, opened in Autumn 1998, at a cost of about ¬£1M. The council planned a phase 2, which would link the Williamstown and Airport roads, at a cost of ¬£1.2M, however this phase was never carried out. Instead it was announced in 2000 that the department of Finance would fund the remainder of the road, between the Williamstown and Cork roads, though ultimately it was completed under the auspices of the National Development Plan (NDP). This main section of the outer ring road was itself built in 3 stages between March 2004 and September 2005. It was officially opened on 30 September 2005 by the then Minister for Transport Martin Cullen, at a final cost of ‚Ç¨37m. Phase one of the outer ring road is a single carriageway road about 1 km in length. The remainder of the road is dual carriageway, in length. This gives a total length of about for the R710 Outer Ring Road between the Ardkeen and Cork road roundabouts. The term Outer Ring Road has been occasionally used specifically for the more recent project, with the NDP and Waterford City Council referring to the project (for this section) merely as the Waterford Outer Ring Road. The 7-year gap between the completion of 'phase one' and the main section, along with the fact that the main section is dual carriageway while the phase one road is single lane perhaps lends an artificial distinction between the two route sections. Link to the N25 October 2009 saw the completion of the N25 Waterford City Bypass (construction commenced 2006), and now the R710 is joined to the bypass via the Western Link. It is now possible travel in a circle around the city from Ardkeen to Slieverue in County Kilkenny, via the second river crossing (the N25 cable stay bridge of about 475 m in length) between Gracedieu and Grannagh.

It was an institution to generations of shoppers in the Buffalo area. The company remained family owned until its sale to The Bon-Ton in 1995. History 234x234px The company was founded in 1867, as Adam, Meldrum & Whiting, at 308-310 Main Street. Co-founder Robert Borthwick Adam, was a brother of the founder of J. N. Adam & Co. In 1876, William Anderson joined the company after Whiting departed and it was renamed Adam, Meldrum & Anderson. In 1886, the company pioneered the use of electricity at a commercial enterprise in Buffalo with the installation of a Westinghouse generator. The company incorporated in 1892. In 1896, it joined the Syndicate Trading Company, a retail joint purchasing company based in New York City. From 1925 to 1956, it operated the Adam, Meldrum & Anderson State Bank, which merged with M&T; Bank. In 1942, Robert Adam III, grandson of the founder, became President and served in that capacity until 1980; then serving as Chief Executive Officer until his death in 1993. The chain was purchased by The Bon- Ton Stores Inc. in 1994. Flagship store Former AM&As; flagship store, June 2009 The original store was located on Main Street in the current site of the Main Place Mall. A $500,000 expansion of the store occurred in 1924, adding to the original location. In 1932, the store expanded northward with the purchased of the Hudson's store at 410 Main Street. From the 1940s until its closing, the store was known locally for its elaborate Victorian Christmas windows. In August 1960, the chain moved its flagship across the street to 389 Main Street in the building formerly occupied by J. N. Adam & Co. After expanding warehouse space in adjacent buildings, a major remodeling of the store occurred in 1966; it was remodeled again a decade later. The store also had a restaurant, the Yankee Doodle Room, which operated from 1960 until 1993; then reopened for a short time as a gourmet market and deli. The flagship store operated as a Bon Ton until 1995. It reopened for eight months in 1998 as Taylor's, an upscale ladies department store. On February 20, 2009, the former flagship store complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the J.N. Adam-AM&A; Historic District.\\"Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties\\": 2/17/09 through 2/20/09 National Register of Historic Places. In 2015, a New York City-based development group purchased the building with the intention of converting it into a 10 floor, 300-room, Asian-themed hotel and restaurant complex. Branch stores AM&A;'s opened the first branch location of a downtown department store in 1948, when it opened a store at University Plaza. In 1950, they opened a branch at Sheridan Plaza in Tonawanda. In October 1952, they took over the former E. W. Edwards & Son location at L.B. Smith Plaza, later Abbott Road Plaza, in Lackawanna; it closed in 1971. During the 1960s through 1980's, many major malls were erected throughout suburban Buffalo and AM&A;'s expanded to most of them. An store opened at Southgate Plaza in 1961, expanded to in 1964.\\"Bon-Ton Extends Lease at Southgate Plaza,\\" Business First of Buffalo, April 22, 1999 (retrieved Sep 10, 2008). In 1966, a store opened at Thruway Plaza, later Thruway Mall. That location would close in 1990, when the Walden Galleria location opened in a store originally constructed for B. Altman. The Eastern Hills Mall location opened in 1972, Lockport Mall store in 1974, and Olean Center Mall in 1976. A store opened in 1979, as part of an expansion to the Summit Park Mall. After the closure of the local Hens & Kelly chain in 1982, AM&A;'s moved into its former location at Northtown Plaza. The McKinley Mall Location opened in 1985. All branch locations operating in 1994, became branches of The Bon Ton. In addition to the retail locations, AM&A;'s operated a bedding and furniture warehouse in the former Pierce Arrow Automobile Manufacturing Facility on Elmwood Avenue @ Great Arrow Street in Buffalo. Customer orders from the retail stores were sent to the warehouse where the items were pulled from stock and inspected for damages. Any scratches, dings, or dents in wood items were corrected by a team of two furniture refinishers. Orders were then set out for delivery to the customers home.

The website was formed by members of the Sri Lankan Tamil community residing in the United States and publishes articles in English, German and French. It is a Tamil nationalist and is described as a pro rebel LTTE website. It is a news site that is relied upon by journalists, civil society and the diplomatic community both within Sri Lanka and globally to seek out the LTTE leadership's perspective on the civil conflict. Tamilnet and non- governmental organizations such as Free Media Movement (FMM), Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and ARTICLE 19 confirm that the website is currently banned in Sri Lanka.  Operations  Tamilnet was started by Muthuthamby Sreetharan, a graduate of Hartley College and native of Karaveddy, Jaffna and Jeyachandran Kopinath. Kopinath functions as the main editor from Norway. Sreetharan currently resides in Bethesda, Maryland. TamilNet articles are written in simple and informative style of reporting. This is in the neutral- authoritative tone of most Western wire news services. TamilNet reporters are on the ground mostly in the provincial villages of the North and East of Sri Lanka, where reporters are supplied with digital equipment. Reports are generated in Tamil and emailed to bilingual translators and editors in United States, Europe, Australia or to Colombo, Sri Lanka. This network of on the ground reporters has allowed TamilNet to circumvent Sri Lankan government's censorship laws. Perceptions Reuters, Associated Press, BBC News, Agence France Presse, Xinhua and Al Jazeera English all refer to TamilNet as \\"the pro-LTTE website\\".http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/06/20096173150357259.html Mark Whitaker, an Associate Professor of Anthropology at the University of South Carolina and research collaborator of former senior TamilNet editor Taraki Sivaram, argues that TamilNet merely shares the Sri Lankan Tamil nationalist ideology of the LTTE and is not an arm of the organization. For instance, he says TamilNet had once fired a sub-editor who had become an activist for the LTTE. He also says TamilNet has faced complaints and \\"extreme displeasure\\" from both the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE. Whitaker also says the LTTE has been deeply unhappy of \\"undue\\" coverage given on TamilNet to criticism of the organization by international human rights organizations. However, Whitaker believes much of the criticism directed at TamilNet by the LTTE is off public view, since the LTTE considers such moves as weakening Tamil nationalism. According to ARTICLE 19, a global human rights organization with a specific mandate and focus on the defense and promotion of freedom of expression and freedom of information worldwide, the news website although some claim it has an LTTE bias, it has over its ten-year life span, earned a reputation for providing alternative news and opinions with a particular focus on the North and East of the country, operating under the banner of \\"Reporting to the World on Tamil Affairs\\". It is relied upon as a credible news source by journalists, civil society and the diplomatic community both within Sri Lanka and globally. Over the years, the site has endured various threats and attacks, including the gunning down in April 2005 of editor, Sivaram Dharmaratnam. Criticism and Counter-Criticism Experts in the field argue TamilNet's accuracy of its reporting has \\"rarely been successfully challenged that such charges ring hollow\\". According to V. Sambandan, Sri Lanka Special Correspondent for the Indian English daily The Hindu, \\"facts and figures are double sourced, checked and are considered 100% credible\\". However a Sri Lanka analyst for the prominent Indian English daily The Hindu, states \\"TamilNet (www.tamilnet.com) is the unofficial mouthpiece of the Tigers in English. It is a kind of news agency chronicling the conflict as perceived by the LTTE. The site is a \`must hit' for any serious Sri Lanka watcher. A senior official in the Sri Lankan Presidential Secretariat told Frontline, \\"My first port of call on the internet is TamilNet. Though it is brazenly pro-Tigers, it is a good guide to know the mind of the Tiger leadership tucked away in the safe havens of the Wanni jungles.\\".http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=20070615004904600.htm&date;=fl2411/&prd;=fline& Threats and murders It has been alleged that members associated with various Sri Lankan political parties have threatened reporters of TamilNet with arrest for \\"treason\\", and once hinted, that \\"uncontrolled extremists might be inspired to perform some extra-judicial killing\\". (See additional information here) In 2004, Ramasamy Thurairatnam, a correspondent for the Lakehouse press group and the TamilNet.com news website, claimed that his life was in danger because a local warlord's supporters have formed death squads whose job is to eliminate those who don't support their point of view in the civil conflict. Due to the same threats the BBC‚Äôs Tamil and Sinhalese services have stopped broadcasting reports from their correspondents in eastern Sri Lanka.Nine recommendations for improving the state of press freedom (19 July 2004) Body of Taraki Sivaram was found behind the Parliament of Sri Lanka's high security zone.

The FMM said that it is \\"deeply disturbed\\" with the news and had the following to say about the ban: When questioned by reporters, Government Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said he was not aware of the shutdown but, \\"We are looking for hackers to disable the Tamilnet but could not find anyone yet.\\" to which FMM responded by saying that it was Cyber terrorism by a government. The Human Rights group Article 19 in a press release on 20 June 2007, said the following regarding the ban on TamilNet: \\"Until now, control measures have largely been directed at local media. Applying these measures to the Internet represents a serious escalation which threatens to cut off an important source of independent and alternative news.

The game simulates training, combat missions and sorties in a tour of duty in the Eighth Air Force of the United States Army Air Forces in the European Theater of Operations aboard a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber during World War II. It was followed by B-17 Flying Fortress: The Mighty 8th in 2000.  Gameplay  Manning a machine gun turret Some aspects that the player has control over are inflight crew management (a crewman might become injured during combat and temporary medical aid inflight given to him whilst another aircrewmen tends another crew position), manning an onboard .50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun against enemy fighters, and releasing the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress's ordnance on the target as well as piloting or copiloting the plane. All ten aircrew positions could be controlled either manually or under AI control, however the main character and captain is the primary pilot. His successes, failures, capture, injury or death affects the direction and conclusion of the campaign. The player can pick out his chosen bomber with its particular nose art and was shown target briefing information and briefing films in the simulation before entering on any mission with the crew. A map of the flight path and waypoints were also shown in the simulation. Although a mission is assigned to the crew before every sortie, the player may break formation and roam freely around Europe if desired, looking for and attacking targets of opportunity. Different targets can easily be discerned from the bombsight, whether a factory or a U-boat pen; terrain graphics are minimal. The success of this decision relies on the skill of the crew, particularly if the navigator is skilled enough to navigate Europe on his own and the crew is able to withstand stronger Luftwaffe fighter and ground defense Flak attacks due to being alone. The most difficult but prestigious targets were the Nazi strongholds in and around Berlin. If the player's B-17 is severely damaged, the player may drop out of the formation and continue the mission on one's own or attempt to return to England, in which one can land on any Allied runway and be taken back to the home base at Alconbury. The player is unable to damage one's own plane using the onboard guns, however, dropping bombs at a low altitude would destroy the plane. The player is also able to shoot down ally Flying Fortresses, as an act of friendly fire. An ill-timed shooting of a Luftwaffe fighter could cause the enemy to lose control and collide with one's B-17 or others in the formation. The game's graphics are very simple (MCGA and VGA) and the requirements are meager when running on an antiquated IBM PC compatible computer; an Intel 80286 microprocessor based (or comparable AMD) based PC is required at 16 MHz with DOS 5.0 (a soundcard is desirable). However a 80386 or better microprocessor is recommended for this software with at least 640k of RAM. The PC version came out in several floppy disk media types (5- 5.25\\" high density disks), compact floppy disks, 4‚Äì3.5\\" high density disks) and CD-ROM versions. Development and release One of the technical advisors to the development of the simulation was Major Joseph N. Worsley (USAAF, Retired) one of the top bombardiers in the USAAF trained in the use of the Norden as well as Sperry bombsights on Boeing B-29s. Dominic Robinson, technical director for the sequel B-17 Flying Fortress: The Mighty 8th also was listed in the software credits for the original title. B-17 Flying Fortress came with a 230-page manual which details how to play the simulation, in addition to an in-depth historical section with numerous illustrations and photographs. The simulation also included a keyboard overlay so that the function of keys on the players keyboard would not be so confusing during gameplay. For a while B-17 Flying Fortress (DOS version only) was released with permission as freeware by MicroProse on the Internet website bombs- away.net. Its sequel came out in the year 2000 and B-17 Flying Fortress as freeware was made into a Microsoft Windows 9x running application from the DOS based version for the PC platform. Shockwave Productions has since bought the rights to the code. Reception Computer Gaming World criticized the poor documentation and inability to start other than in November 1943 even after finishing a 25-mission tour. The magazine concluded that while the game \\"points the way for future designs in the genre with its character-based approach ... It will not, however, satisfy those who expect a comprehensive, flexible treatment of the subject.\\" A 1993 survey in the magazine of wargames gave the game three stars out of five, stating that \\"Bomber operations are inherently dull ... and this simulation more than covers the topic.\\"  See also  *European Air War References External links * Category:1992 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:DOS games Category:MicroProse games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:World War II flight simulation video games ","title":"B-17 Flying Fortress (video game)"},{"id":"6600576","text":"1930s public information poster warning of \\"cancer quacks\\" Alternative cancer treatment describes any cancer treatment or practice that is not part of the conventional standard of cancer care. These include special diets and exercises, chemicals, herbs, devices, and manual procedures. Most alternative cancer treatments do not have high-quality evidence supporting their use. Concerns have been raised about the safety of some of them. Some have even been found to be unsafe in certain settings. Despite this, many untested and disproven treatments are used around the world. Promoting or marketing such treatments is illegal in most of the developed world. Alternative cancer treatments are typically contrasted with experimental cancer treatments ‚Äì science-based treatment methods ‚Äì and complementary treatments, which are non- invasive practices used in combination with conventional treatment. All approved chemotherapy medications were considered experimental treatments before completing safety and efficacy testing. Since the late 19th century, medical researchers have established modern cancer care through the development of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapies, and refined surgical techniques. , only 32.9% of cancer patients in the United States died within five years of their diagnosis. Despite their effectiveness, many conventional treatments are accompanied by a wide range of side effects, including pain, fatigue, and nausea. Some side effects can even be life- threatening. Many supporters of alternative treatments claim increased effectiveness and decreased side effects when compared to conventional treatments. However, one retrospective cohort study showed that patients using alternative treatments instead of conventional treatments were 2.5 times more likely to die within five years. Most alternative cancer treatments have not been tested in proper clinical trials. Among studies that have been published, the quality is often poor. A 2006 review of 196 clinical trials that studied unconventional cancer treatments found a lack of early-phase testing, little rationale for dosing regimens, and poor statistical analyses . These kinds of treatments have appeared and vanished throughout history. Terminology Complementary and alternative cancer treatments are often grouped together, in part because of the adoption of the phrase \\"complementary and alternative medicine\\" by the United States Congress. Complementary treatments are used in conjunction with proven mainstream treatments. They tend to be pleasant for the patient, not involve substances with any pharmacological effects, inexpensive, and intended to treat side effects rather than to kill cancer cells. Medical massage and self-hypnosis to treat pain are examples of complementary treatments. About half the practitioners who dispense complementary treatments are physicians, although they tend to be generalists rather than oncologists. As many as 60% of American physicians have referred their patients to a complementary practitioner for some purpose. While conventional physicians should always be kept aware of any complementary treatments used by a patient, many physicians in the United Kingdom are at least tolerant of their use, and some might recommend them.\\"The difference between complementary and alternative therapies\\", Cancer Research UK, accessed 20 November 2014 Alternative treatments, by contrast, are used in place of mainstream treatments. The most popular alternative cancer therapies include restrictive diets, mind-body interventions, bioelectromagnetics, nutritional supplements, and herbs. The popularity and prevalence of different treatments varies widely by region. Cancer Research UK warns that alternative treatments may interact with conventional treatment, may increase the side effects of medication, and can give people false hope. Prevalence Survey data about how many cancer patients use alternative or complementary therapies vary from nation to nation as well as from region to region. A 2000 study published by the European Journal of Cancer evaluated a sample of 1023 women from a British cancer registry suffering from breast cancer and found that 22.4% had consulted with a practitioner of complementary therapies in the previous twelve months. The study concluded that the patients had spent many thousands of pounds on such measures and that use \\"of practitioners of complementary therapies following diagnosis is a significant and possibly growing phenomenon\\". In Australia, one study reported that 46% of children suffering from cancer have been treated with at least one non-traditional therapy. Further 40% of those of any age receiving palliative care had tried at least one such therapy. Some of the most popular alternative cancer treatments were found to be dietary therapies, antioxidants, high dose vitamins, and herbal therapies. Use of unconventional cancer treatments in the United States has been influenced by the U.S. federal government's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), initially known as the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), which was established in 1992 as a National Institutes of Health (NIH) adjunct by the U.S. Congress. More specifically, the NIC's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine sponsors over $105 million a year in grants for pseudoscientific cancer research. Over thirty American medical schools have offered general courses in alternative medicine, including the Georgetown, Columbia, and Harvard university systems, among others. People who choose alternative treatments People are drawn to alternative treatments for many reasons, including distrust of medical professionals and a lack of approved medical options. Among patients with untreatable conditions, \\"desperation drives them into the hands of anyone with a promise and a smile.\\" Con artists have long exploited patients' perceived lack of options to extract payments for ineffectual and even harmful treatments. No evidence suggests that the use of alternative treatments improves survival. In 2017, one retrospective, observational study suggested that people who chose alternative medicine instead of conventional treatments were more than twice as likely to die within five years of diagnosis. Breast cancer patients choosing alternative medicine were 5.68 times more likely to die within five years of diagnosis. In a survey of American cancer patients, baby boomers were more likely to support complementary and alternative treatments than people from an older generation. White, female, college- educated patients who had been diagnosed more than a year ago were more likely than others to report a favorable impression of at least some complementary and alternative benefits.  Unproven and disproven treatments  : Many therapies without evidence have been promoted to treat or prevent cancer in humans. In many cases, evidence suggests that the treatments do not work. Unlike accepted cancer treatments, unproven and disproven treatments are generally ignored or avoided by the medical community. Despite this, many of these therapies have continued to be promoted as effective, particularly by promoters of alternative medicine. Scientists consider this practice quackery, and some of those engaged in it have been investigated and prosecuted by public health regulators such as the US Federal Trade Commission, the Mexican Secretariat of Health and the Canadian Competition Bureau. In the United Kingdom, the Cancer Act makes the unauthorized promotion of cancer treatments a criminal offense. In 2008, the United States Federal Trade Commission acted against some companies that made unsupported claims that their products, some of which included highly toxic chemicals, could cure cancer. Targets included Omega Supply, Native Essence Herb Company, Daniel Chapter One, Gemtronics, Inc., Herbs for Cancer, Nu-Gen Nutrition, Inc., Westberry Enterprises, Inc., Jim Clark's All Natural Cancer Therapy, Bioque Technologies, Cleansing Time Pro, and Premium-essiac-tea-4less. Areas of research =Specific methods= * Curcumin is a component of turmeric. It is under preliminary research for therapeutic potential but according to Cancer Research UK no reputable organization supports claims that it can \\"cure\\" cancer. *Psilocybin is a psychedelic compound found in more than 100 mushroom species. Three small trials have demonstrated decreased cancer-related psychiatric distress, including anxiety and depression with its use. * HuaChanSu, traditional Chinese medicine extracted from the skin of the Bufo toad * Medical cannabis (for \\"appetite stimulation\\" and \\"pain\\") * Selenium =Pain relief= Most studies of complementary and alternative medicine in the treatment of cancer pain are of low quality in terms of scientific evidence. Studies of massage therapy have produced mixed results, but overall show some temporary benefit for reducing pain, anxiety, and depression and a very low risk of harm, unless the patient is at risk for bleeding disorders. There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis, supportive psychotherapy and cognitive therapy. Results about Reiki and touch therapy were inconclusive. The most studied such treatment, acupuncture, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain. The evidence for music therapy is equivocal, and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some cancer patients. The most promising evidence, though still weak, is for mind‚Äìbody interventions such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques. Examples of complementary therapy As stated in the scientific literature, the measures listed below are defined as 'complementary' because they are applied in conjunction with mainstream anti-cancer measures such as chemotherapy, in contrast to the ineffective therapies viewed as 'alternative' since they are offered as substitutes for mainstream measures. * Acupuncture may help with nausea but does not treat the disease. A 2015 Cochrane review found unclear usefulness for cancer pain, though other reviews have found tentative evidence of benefit. It is of unclear effect in hot flashes in people with breast cancer. * The effects of aromatherapy are unclear with no peer-reviewed research in regards to cancer treatment. * Psychotherapy may reduce anxiety and improve quality of life as well as allow for improving patient moods. * Massage therapy may temporarily reduce pain. * There is no evidence that cannabis has a beneficial effect in preventing or treating cancer in humans. * Hypnosis and meditation may improve the quality of life of cancer patients. * Music therapy eases cancer-related symptoms by helping with mood disturbances. Alternative theories of cancer Some alternative cancer treatments are based on unproven or disproven theories of how cancer begins or is sustained in the body. Some common concepts are: =Mind-body connection= This idea says that cancer progression is related to a person's mental and emotional state. Treatments based on this idea are mind‚Äìbody interventions. Proponents say that cancer forms because the person is unhappy or stressed, or that a positive attitude can cure cancer after it has formed. A typical claim is that stress, anger, fear, or sadness depresses the immune system, whereas that love, forgiveness, confidence, and happiness cause the immune system to improve, and that this improved immune system will destroy the cancer. This belief that generally boosting the immune system's activity will kill the cancer cells is not supported by any scientific research. In fact, many cancers require the support of an active immune system (especially through inflammation) to establish the tumor microenvironment necessary for a tumor to grow. =Toxin theory of cancer= In this idea, the body's metabolic processes are overwhelmed by normal, everyday byproducts. These byproducts, called \\"toxins\\", are said to build up in the cells and cause cancer and other diseases through a process sometimes called autointoxication or autotoxemia. Treatments following this approach are usually aimed at detoxification or body cleansing, such as enemas. =Low activity by the immune system= This claim asserts that if only the body's immune system were strong enough, it would kill the \\"invading\\" or \\"foreign\\" cancer. Unfortunately, most cancer cells retain normal cell characteristics, making them appear to the immune system to be a normal part of the body. Cancerous tumors also actively induce immune tolerance, which prevents the immune system from attacking them. =Epigenetic disregulation= This claim uses research into the mechanism of epigenetics to understand how mutations in the epigenetic machinery of cells will altered histone acetylation patterns to create cancer epigenetics. DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer. If DNA repair is deficient, DNA damage tends to accumulate. Such excess DNA damage can increase mutational errors during DNA replication due to error-prone translesion synthesis. Excess DNA damage can also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to cancer.

It is set in the World War II Pacific air war theatre, and was the first of Lucasfilm Games' trilogy of World War II flight simulations, followed by Their Finest Hour (1989) and Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe (1991). The 127-page manual for Battlehawks 1942 includes a 100-page illustrated overview of the Pacific War. Gameplay In Battlehawks 1942, the player can participate in four pivotal naval battles of the Pacific war: * The Battle of the Coral Sea (May 4‚Äì8, 1942) * The Battle of Midway (June 4‚Äì5, 1942) * The Battle of the Eastern Solomons (August 23‚Äì25, 1942) * The Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands (October 26, 1942) In each of these battles, the player can experience the same situation from the U.S. side or the Japanese side of the battle. The player can fly authentic aircraft of the era such as Grumman F4F Wildcats, Douglas SBD Dauntlesses and Grumman TBF Avengers on the U.S. side and Mitsubishi A6M Zeros, Aichi D3A \\"Vals\\" and Nakajima B5N \\"Kates\\" on the Japanese side. Realism settings such as invincibility, unlimited ammo and unlimited fuel, starting altitude and the caliber of the opposition pilots were present, so Battlehawks was customizable. Each mission started with a briefing, giving the pilot a general outline of what was needed to do. In a departure from the usual flight-sim standards requiring players to perform take offs and landings, Battlehawks 1942 allowed players to get immediately into the action. As with most flight simulators, Battlehawks has a cockpit view, switchable with the keypad for a look around the aircraft. Instruments are few: airspeed, altimeter, bank and pitch, fuel, rate-of-climb, RPM, compass and indicators for fuel and engine/airframe damage. The cockpit also had levers for landing gear, speed brakes (if equipped) and flaps. The Battlehawks 1942 manual includes details Fighter Tactics instructions, such as deflection shooting or how to perform overhead approaches from the same or the opposite course. Mission types included escorting bombers as well as fighter interceptions, which were generally quite challenging and gave a great view of the diversity of the missions that were flown in the Pacific in 1942. Allied players flying Grumman F4F Wildcats would find themselves often vastly outnumbered in a desperate attempt to save their carriers from waves of Japanese Aichi D3A Val dive bombers. There are also dive-bombing and torpedo- bombing missions on both sides. Dive-bomber and torpedo-bomber tactics were also discussed in the manual. The graphics throughout the game use a sprite- based (so-called) 3D engine, which is based on bitmaps which are rotated and scaled depending on the player's view. Muzzle flashes and tracers were present, the aircraft took hits and caught fire, smoked or exploded with the pilot bailing out with a parachute. Enemy artificial intelligence (AI) also was of high quality. Enemy aircraft would twist, turn, jink and realistically evade enemy fire. The performance characteristics of the various aircraft were realistically modeled so that, for example, the more nimble Japanese Zeros were very good at outmaneuvering U.S. fighters such as the F4F Wildcat. Excellent pilots achieved promotions and several medals in Battlehawks (Air Medal, DFC, Bronze Star, Silver Star, Navy Cross and the Medal of Honor - if the player's own aircraft received severe hits, the Purple Heart was awarded). Pacific theater air combat simulation successors of Battlehawks include: Aces of the Pacific (1992), 1942: The Pacific Air War (1994), Pacific Strike (1994), WarBirds (1997), and Pacific Fighters (2004). Reception Computer Gaming World very favorably reviewed the game, citing its graphics, historical accuracy, and innovative replay feature, giving the player a free-roaming camera with which to view the action. The magazine later awarded the game as \\"Action Game of the Year\\", reiterating those praises, a 1991 survey in the magazine of strategy and war games gave it four stars out of five, and a 1993 survey gave the game three stars. Compute! also praised the game's graphics, accuracy, and replay, and also cited its unpredictable enemies as a virtue. According to the review in STart, \\"if you're an aviation enthusiast at all, you'll want Battlehawks 1942 just for its extensive manual. It's 127 pages of history, tactics, theory and aviation lore and includes fold-out maps of the battles in which you can fly. It's truly a spectacular production and almost worth the price of the game by itself.\\"STart Magazine, Vol. 4, No. 4, November 1989, page 44. The game was also well received by the reviewers of Dragon, where it was given 5 out of 5 stars. According to the game's designer Lawrence Holland, Chris Roberts told him at an industry conference that he had reverse- engineered Battlehawks 1942 to create the game engine for Wing Commander.

Gameplay The goal of the game is to promote and sell oil and defeat competitors using a number of fair and unfair strategies. A game move always takes a month, and each action in the game costs one or more days. The game is designed for four players, either human (using a hot seat method) or computer-controlled. Players take on the management of one of four corporations: \\"Interoil\\", \\"All American\\", \\"Transoil\\" or \\"Explora Inc.\\" There are four different game objectives to choose from: to play a three-year game, to survive the longest of all the game companies, to receive an 80% market share or to reach 60 million dollars. There are some game mechanic variations between the missions. For example, when playing to the first 60 million dollars, drilling a borehole takes longer than in the other missions. There are eight oil-producing regions to choose from where players must acquire licenses, tankers and oil fields: Alaska, North America, Central America,Patricia Madrigal Cordero. ‚ÄúCentral America.‚Äù Yearbook of International Environmental Law 22.1 (2012): 360‚Äì365.

Europe, USSR, the Gulf region and Indochina. The player can request an expert opinion of an oil field's probable yield before purchase. Once a field has been bought, the player may drill manually or pay game money for automatic drilling. Enemies in the game can disrupt play using sabotage. This can be done by igniting the oil fields, destroying tankers, manipulating balance sheets, etc. To protect against such moves, a player can hire a security company. In the course of the game there are three action sequences. Oil sales can lead to delays, and the player must manually lay pipeline. Manual drilling requires the player to correct the deviation of the drill head. Finally, burning oil wells must be deleted using dynamite. The latter can be carried out by a specialist called \\"Ted Redhair\\" (inspired by the famous Red Adair).

It has been published continuously since 1850 and is among the oldest of Catholic Italian periodicals. All of the journal's articles are the collective responsibility of the entire \\"college\\" of the magazine's writers even if published under a single author's name.\\"The Vatican and Vaticanologists. A Very Special Kind of Journalism\\", Sandro Magister,www.chiesa.espresso.repubblica.i, 7.6.2005, It is the only one to be directly revised by the Secretariat of State of the Holy See and to receive its approval before being published.\\"The Vatican and Vaticanologists. A Very Special Kind of Journalism\\", Sandro Magister,www.chiesa.espresso.repubblica.i, 7.6.2005, The periodical is headquartered since 1951 in the Villa Malta (Pincian Hill) situated in Via F. Crispi, Rome. In more recent times the magazine has advocated reaching out to children, teens, and young people who use and interact with social media (Facebook, Twitter, Skype, YouTube, etc., on devices such as the iPod and iPad) to an intense degree, and find ways to foster their faith life through interior meditation, including, among other exercises, the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, the Jesuits' founder.  Mission  The journal seeks to promote a catholic culture, thought, and civilization in the modern world. Its founder, Fr. Carlo Maria Curci, wrote that it brings \\"the idea and the movement of civilization to that Catholic concept which it seems to have divorced from for about three centuries.\\" Although the magazine aims to reach a wide audience and be understood by all, it intends to treat issues with scientific rigour.The official website In his 2006 address to the college of journalists at the journal Pope Benedict XVI noted:  History  = Founding of the periodical and Papal influence = The periodical was founded by the Jesuit priest Carlo Maria Curci, who \\"felt the need for an exposition, at the highest intellectual level, of the point of view of the Papacy in matters religious and political.\\"Hales, E.E.Y., Pio Nono, Image Books, 1962, p. 297 During the years of the risorgimento, the Church was physically and intellectually \\"in a state of siege\\"Hales, p. 296 and many thought the undertaking \\"too hazardous,\\" but Pius IX himself \\"insisted that Curci was right that the flood of anti-Papal propaganda [from liberals, Protestants, and others] could only be met by a reasoned statement of the Papal case...\\"Hales, p. 297 Other sources cite the desire to defend \\"catholic civilization\\" against a perceived growing influence of liberals and freemasons.La Civilt√† Cattolica: La storia , La Biblioteca del Senato della Repubblica \\"Giovanni Spadolini\\", 28 April 2011.La Nostra storia: L'idea che spinse alla fondazione della rivista , La Civilt√† Cattolica. The first issue was released in Naples on 6 April 1850 in Italian (rather than Latin), although due to censorship by the House of Bourbon the editorial office was transferred to Rome that same year. Upon moving to Rome, the periodical became the unofficial voice of the Holy See. The bimonthly journal was published through papal funding by order of Pope Pius IX and, according to Papal critic Susan Zucotti, readers recognised it as representing contemporary Vatican opinionZuccotti, p. 11 However, Catholic writer E.E.Y. Hales wrote that \\"it was not an official organ of the Papal government, indeed the Pope often expressed the keenest displeasure with what it said. Curci [the paper's first editor] was independent-minded; so were his collaborators...\\" Papal influence was demonstrated by the dismissal of Curci by Pius IX in 1875. A special 50th anniversary edition of the journal asserted \\"More than a simple journal [La Civilt√† Cattolica] is an institution desired and created by the Holy See and placed at exclusive service for the defense of the Sacred doctrine and the rights of the Church\\".Kertzer, p. 311 fn. 4 During the papacy of Pius X, the editor of the journal began to be appointed by the pope or with his approval. During the 1920s and 30s, the journal has been described as \\"extremely authoritative...because of its tight ties with the [Vatican] Secretary of State.\\"Zuccotti, p. 11, quoting Giovanni Miccoli In 1924, Pope Pius XI wrote: \\"from the journal's very beginning the authors set for themselves that sacred and immutable duty of defending the rights of the Apostolic See and the Catholic faith, and struggling against the poison that the doctrine of liberalism had injected into the very veins of States and societies..\\"Kertzer, p. 324, fn. 11 citing (Civilta cattolica, 1924, III, p. 291) The historian Richard Webster described its influence in 1938 as reflecting the views of the Pontiff. During the papacy of Pius XII, all articles were reviewed prior to publication by the Secretariat of State. In his 1999 address to the editorial staff to mark the 150th anniversary of journal, Pope John Paul II observed: :Reviewing the past 150 years of your journal, we note a great variety of positions due to changing historical circumstances and to the personalities of the individual writers. However, in the broad, complex panorama of religious, social and political events that from 1850 to today have involved the Church and Italy, one constant can always be seen in the volumes of La Civilt√† Cattolica: the total loyalty, even if sometimes difficult, to the teachings and directives of the Holy See and love and veneration for the person of the Pope. Pope Pius IX supported the journal in order to have an effective means of defending Catholic thought. Cardinal Giacomo Antonelli also lent support. The Superior General of the Jesuits, Father Joannes Philippe Roothaan (1783‚Äì1853), was more cautious. He warned that Jesuit involvement in political issues might damage the Jesuit reputation. The periodical initially had a polemical tone. This was typical of Christian apologetics in the 19th century. Early editors include: * Luigi Taparelli D'Azeglio (1793‚Äì1862), philosopher of law. * Matteo Liberatore (1810‚Äì1892), scholar of Thomist philosophy. Liberatore was a forerunner of Catholic social teaching. Pope Leo XIII asked him to outline the papal encyclical Rerum novarum. * Antonio Bresciani (1798‚Äì1862), scholar of literature. * Giovanni Battista Pianciani (1784‚Äì1862), scholar of Natural science. As students, Jesuit priests Carlo Piccirillo (1821‚Äì1888) and Giuseppe Oreglia di Santo Stefano (1823‚Äì1895) contributed to the magazine. On 12 February 1866, Pope Pius IX issued the Apostolic Brief Gravissimum Supremi with which he formed a College of Writers from those working on the journal. The special statute of the College of Writers was again confirmed by Pope Leo XIII in 1890. When Italian troops entered Rome in 1870, publication of the periodical was suspended for three months. It was taken up again in Florence in 1871, where it stayed until returning to Rome in 1876.http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/la-civilta-cattolica/ Until 1933, the writers were anonymous. From that year on, the articles were signed. = La Civilt√† Cattolica in the 19th century = La Civilt√† Cattolica contributed to the Syllabus of Errors, the First Vatican Council (1869‚Äì1870) and to the task of restoring Thomist philosophy, which flourished during the pontificate of Pope Leo XIII (1878‚Äì1903). The journal held an anti-evolutionistic position, and was often the main source for Vatican thinking on the issue, as no direct statements were made.Artigas, 2,5, However, the opening in 1998 of the Archive of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (previously called the Holy Office or the Congregation of the Index) revealed that on many crucial points and in specific cases, the Vatican position had been less dogmatic than the journal had suggested at the time.Artigas, 2,5,7-9,220 etc. The journal held a prominent role in the Italian political arena. It reviewed the events which led to the unification of Italy and the Roman Question. After the Capture of Rome in 1870, the journal opposed the liberalist political party and modernism. During the late 1800s the paper also published several anti-Semitic articles. According to Jewish writer Pinchas Lapide, the paper, for example, re-awoke the myth that Jews ritualistically killed Christian children to use the victim's blood in their bread: \\"In spite of six papal condemnations of the blood legend and in spite of Pope Innocent III's explicit command ('Nor shall anyone accuse them of using human blood in their religious rites... [W]e strictly forbid the recurrence of such a thing') the order... published, between February 1881 and December 1882, a series of articles [which contained such assertions as]: 'Every year the Hebrews crucify a child... [and] in order that the blood be effective, the child must die in torment' (21 Jan. 1882, p. 214).\\"Lapide, Pinchas, Three Popes and the Jews, p. 81, Hawthorne Books, Inc., 1967 publication_date. = La Civilt√† Cattolica and the rise of Fascism = In the early 20th century, the journal promoted the development of a Catholic ruling class. (A decline had occurred particularly after the Non Expedit, a papal policy promulgated in the late 19th century that discouraged Catholics from taking an active part in the political process.) After the signing of the Lateran treaty in 1929, Father Enrico Rosa, the editor of the journal met with Alleanza Nazionale, (an anti-fascist) group of Catholic monarchists. In 1936, Father Antonio Messineo (1897‚Äì1968) published an article in La Civilt√† Cattolica about the legitimacy of colonialism. At the time, Italy was annexing Ethiopia in opposition to the League of Nations. In 1937 the journal published the letter of the Spanish bishops dated 1 July 1937 dealing with the civil war.. This letter, supporting the dictatorial movement of general Francisco Franco was ignored by the Osservatore Romano. In September 1938 the journal published details of the new Italian race laws which revoked the citizenship of anyone \\"of Jewish race\\" who had acquired Italian citizenship after 1918, ordering those who were not citizens to leave the country within six months.Kertzer 285, journal ref for all the Kertzer's notes in this paragraph given on p. 326 fn. 42 as \\"italia: 2.

Recognising that fact, they confirmed most of the original assertions. As in 1890 they denounced.....the Jesuit fathers writers even threw in new charges, impossible in 1890, that the Communists owed their successful revolution largely to Jews....Jews who converted should always be encouraged and welcomed, innocents protected, and \\"justice\\" preserved....The repeal of emancipation must be effected through changes in the law. Repeal of emancipation through changes in the law was exactly what Mussolini was contemplating at the time\\" with journal refs given on p. 340. fn. 21 citing \\" \\"Cronaca contemporanea\\", La Civilita Cattolica, anno 89, 1938, vol III, quad, 2118, 17 September 1938, 560-61; R. Rosa, \\"La Questione giudaica e 'La Civilta Cattolica,\\" anno 89, 1938, vol. IV, quad, 2119, 1 October 1938, 3-16 It noted that the journal's 1890 campaign was inspired \\"by the spectacle of the Judaic invasion and of Judaic arrogance\\" but that it would be anachronistic to call these articles fascist since the term didn't exist then.Kertzer, p. 286 After making distinctions between the Church's and fascist approach to the \\"Jewish problem\\", in particular fascists using biological arguments which were contrary to Church teaching, the journal concluded that the battle against the Jews \\"is to be understood as a struggle inspired solely by the need for legitimate defense of Christian people against a foreign nation in the nations where they live and against the sworn enemy of their well-being. This suggests [the need for] measures to render such peoples harmless.\\" (emphasis appears in the original journal article)Kertzer, p. 286-287. Zuccotti, p. 47, notes \\"While the editors of La Civilta Cattolica were implicitly approving anti-Jewish legal measures in Italy, however, they continued to oppose German racism. Again the distinction was absolutely clear to them. In the 17 September issue, the same one that carried the first justification of the anti-Jewish series of 1890, an article condemned current German race-purification policies, including forced sterilisation, differing categories of citizenship, restrictions on marriage, and the glorification of \\"Aryanism\\" citing A. Messineo, \\"L' Ordine giuridico nella nuoya Germania\\", La Civilta Cattolica, anno 89, 1938, vol. III, quad. 2118, 17 September 1938, 506-19 Italian stamp commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Civilt√† Cattolica In 1938 Fr. Enrico Rosa published an articleLa questione giudaica e \\"La Civilt√† Cattolica\\", in La Civilt√† Cattolica, year 89 - Vol. IV - 1 October 1938 - quaderno 2119 in which he analyzed some of the criticisms made to the periodical by a study on the Jewish question. Fr. Rosa negated the accusations according to which the periodical favoured two measures against Jews in 1890: the confiscation of property and the expulsion from Italy; Fr. Rosa affirmed that neither of the two are admissible by the Christian spirit, and that the periodical did not sustain them, though he did admit that the force of the controversy in that historical moment did not help to express the positions in a very clear way. In this same article Fr. Rosa warned against the rising fascist antisemitism. In the same year however, the periodical commented favorably on the fascist Manifesto of Race, trying to prove a difference between this and the nazi manifesto.La Civilt√† Cattolica, 1938, fasc. 2115, pp. 277‚Äì278. Fascist leader Roberto Farinacci saw a tie between fascist antisemitic policies and articles published in the journal.Kertzer, p. 283 \\"Here Farinacci - and in this he was no different from many other fascist leaders - acknowledged the important role played by Civilita cattolica, \\"without doubt,\\" he said, \\"the most authoritative of all the Catholic periodicals.\\" citing Farinacci, 1938, La Cheiesa e gli ebrei. Conferenza tenuta il 7 novembre xvii..a Milano per l'inaugurazione annuale dello Instituto di cultura fascista. Rome In particular he cited an 1890 article from the journal in which he reports the Jews are described as \\"a depraved race\\" and \\"an enemy of mankind\\" and calling \\"for the annulment of all laws that give the Jews political and civil equality\\".Kertzer, p. 283-284; citing Farinacci, 1938, La Cheiesa e gli ebrei. Conferenza tenuta il 7 novembre xvii..a Milano per l'inaugurazione annuale dello Instituto di cultura fascista. Rome Farinacci reported that another journal article, which had just been published a few months before, asserted that \\"the Judaic religion was profoundly corrupted\\" and had warned \\"that Judaism still aims for world domination.\\"kertzer, p. 284 citing Farinacci, 1938, La Cheiesa e gli ebrei. Conferenza tenuta il 7 novembre xvii..a Milano per l'inaugurazione annuale dello Instituto di cultura fascista. Rome Farinacci also compared some policies of the Jesuits to the Aryan racism of the Nazis.The Jesuits refused in a certain period of their history to admit entrance to their order from people of Jewish blood. Kertzer, p. 284 Farinacci concluded that the Fascists had in the Jesuits \\"constant precursors and masters in the Jewish question...and if we can be faulted for anything, it is for not having applied all of their instransigence in our dealing with the Jews\\".Kertzer, p. 284, citing Farinacci, 1938, La Cheiesa e gli ebrei. Conferenza tenuta il 7 novembre xvii..a Milano per l'inaugurazione annuale dello Instituto di cultura fascista. Rome Il Regime Fascista in 1938 published an article which asserted \\"even though we ourselves have never felt such cruelty and hatred...Both for Italy and Germany there is still much to learn from the disciples of Jesus, and we must admit that both in its planning and in its execution, Fascism is still far from the excessive severity of the people of Civilita Cattolica\\".Lapide, p. 108 citing edition dated 28 August 1938, and noting the article's \\"biting sarcasm\\". David Kertzer questions the sincerity of Farinacci and other fascist leaders who cited the Church to justify their own racial laws but in his view they could only have done so because the Church had \\"indeed helped lay the groundwork for the Fascist racial laws.\\"Kertzer, p. 285 = La Civilt√† Cattolica and Communism = In the second post-war era La Civilt√† Cattolica cautioned against the dangers of communism in Italy and in the Eastern European countries. In the journal, Father Riccardo Lombardi (1908‚Äì1979), encouraged Catholics organise to oppose the Left in the campaign of 1948. There was disagreement in the College of Writers as to whether Catholics should choose their own political alliances. The editor, Father James Martegnani (1902‚Äì1981), favoured a right-wing coalition between the Common Man's Front, the Italian Social Movement and part of the Christian Democracy party. Martegnani and Monsignor Roberto Ronca (1901‚Äì1978), the Bishop of Pompei, created Civilt√† Italica, a Christian political movement. However, the arguments of Alcide De Gasperi (1881‚Äì1954) represented by Father Anthony Messineo and by Father Salvatore Lener (1907‚Äì1983), prevailed. The stemma of the Company of Jesus Some Catholic historians believe La Civilt√† Cattolica later denounced the totalitarian states of the 1900s. Others do not agree. In the late 20th century Father Robert Graham published articles which sought to refute the accusations relating to the \\"silence\\" of Pope Pius XII during the Holocaust. = La Civilt√† Cattolica after the Second Vatican Council =  Renewed outlook  La Civilt√† Cattolica documented and reported the details of the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965). Some writers participated as experts. After the Council, the journal took on a conciliatory tone which promoted a dialogue with the modern world, whilst holding to the beliefs of Roman Catholicism. The Papacy of Pope John Paul II influenced La Civilt√† Cattolica with a renewed missionary perspective, with revived apologetical articles, and with the task of promoting the New Evangelization.  In the Italian political arena  At the time of the Historic Compromise, the journal called for the reestablishment of the Christian Democracy. Secularism was spreading through Italy, witnessed in the referendum defeats on issues such as divorce and abortion. Catholics were becoming a minority thus weakening their political strength.

Negative liturgical references to the Jews were expurgated, accompanied by a complete revision of what children were taught about Jews in school lessons and catechetical works.Kertzer, p. 20 According to Zuccotti (2000), antisemitism based on racial differences has rarely featured in Roman Catholicism. During the 1920s and the 1930s, racial antisemitism was condemned by Church spokesmen.Zuccotti, p. 10-11 Pinchas Lapide, however, likened the Jesuits to Himmler's SS because in the era of Hitler both were closed to people within certain degrees of Jewish descent (a requirement that was dropped in 1946).Lapide p. 108; James Carroll in \\"Constantines Sword\\", p. 382‚Äì383, citing Jesuit scholar John Padberg (\\"For matters of greater moment: the first thirty Jesuit General Councils\\"), quotes the text of the 1593-1594 council decree and states that the restriction on Jewish/Muslim converts was limited only to the degree of parentage. Fourteen years later this was extended back to the fifth degree. Over time the restriction relating to Muslim ancestry was dropped. In 1923, the 27th Jesuit council specified \\"The impediment of origin extends to all who are descended from the Jewish race, unless it is clear that their father, grandfather, and great grandfather have belonged to the Catholic Church.\\" In 1946, the 29th council dropped the requirement but still called for \\"cautions to be exercised before admitting a candidate about whom there is some doubt as to the character of his hereditary background.\\" Maryks interprets the 1593 \\"Decree de genere\\" as preventing, despite Loyola's desires, any Jewish or Muslim conversos and, by extension, any person with Jewish or Muslim ancestry, no matter how distant, from admission to the Society of Jesus, Maryks, p. xxviii Lapide further notes that the journal was particularly outspoken in its hatred of the Jews, publishing numerous articles on the subject, and that most of the tenets that are a feature of modern antisemitism can be found in journal's articles dating from the 1890s.Lapide, p. 80; See Kertzer, p 134‚Äì147 for an extended analysisKertzer, p. 135 notes that the journals \\"anti-Jewish campaign, coming when it did, proved crucial to the rise of modern anti-Semitism.\\" They continued to support accusations made against Alfred Dreyfus even after his innocence had been legally established.Lapide, p. 82 \\"La Civilt√† Cattolica\\" condemned antisemitism based on race. It did promote religious discrimination in the belief that Jews were responsible for deicide and ritual murder and had undue control of society. The journal did not promote violence against Jews.Zuccotti, p. 9 In 1909, Hitler visited Vienna to \\"study the Jewish problem\\" under the guidance of the zealot Roman Catholic Karl Lueger. Lueger was Vienna's mayor. He was also leader of the \\"rabidly anti-Semitic\\" Christian Social Party.Lapide, p. 81 \\"He was a zealous Catholic, and wished to \\"capture the university\\" for the Church; he would have neither Social Democrats nor Pan-Germans nor Jews in the municipal administration\\" Hitler greatly admired Lueger. His first anti-Semitic pamphlets were published by the Christian Socialists which reprinted several articles from La Civilt√† Cattolica.Lapide, p. 81‚Äì82Zuccotti, p. 10 \\"Hitler himself admitted to being inspired by its leader, Karl Leuger.\\" Lapide (1967) suggests Hitler may have been influenced by \\"La Civilt√† Cattolica\\". In 1914 the journal described Jews as drinking blood as if it was milk in the context of killing Christian children.Kertzer, p. 236; Kenneth R. Stow notes that the journal was still promoting the charge of ritual murder whilst other Jesuits were repudiating it. (\\"Jewish dogs\\", Stanford Studies in Jewish History And Culture, p. xiii, Stanford University Press, 2006, ) Der St√ºrmer printed a special edition dedicated to \\"Jewish ritual murder\\" which included extensive quotations from \\"La Civilt√† Cattolica\\".\\"Lapide 81-82; In 1921 the anti-Semitic Deutchvolkische Monatshefte printed on its front cover a caricature of a Jew as a giant octopus enveloping a blond woman who represented Germany. Daniel Goldhagen, A Moral Reckoning, 2003, Abacus, treats this as a recollection of the Civilta Cattolica article from 1893 that describes Jews as \\"the giant octopus that with its oversized tentacles envelops everything\\" citing Kertzer p. 145 who refs F. Saverio Rondina, \\"La morale giudaica\\" Civilta cattolica 1893, I, pp. 145-53 A 1920 article in journal described Jews as \\"the filthy element\\" who \\"were avid for money\\" and who wanted to \\"proclaim the communist republic tomorrow.\\"Wills, p. 37 As Hitler escalated his anti-Jewish policies during the 1930s, the journal, according to Zuccotti (2000), not only failed to downplay its particular brand of anti-Judaism but repeated it more often.Zuccotti, p. 12 In 1934, Enrico Rosa wrote two reviews of \\"the notorious German anti-Semitic manual\\" (Handbuch der Judenfrage). According to Zuccotti (2000), Rosa found the authors guilty only of exaggeration and that the authors were applauded for equating Jews with Freemasons, describing Jews as the \\"relentless irreconcilable enemies of Christ and of Christianity, particularly of integral and pure Christianity, the Catholicism of the Roman Church\\". In 1936, the journal reported that \\"if not all, still not a few Jews constitute a grave and permanent danger to society\\" because of their economic and political influence.Lapide, p. 107 cites 3 October 1936 edition The reviewer opined that the book's three options for dealing with \\"the Jewish problem\\", i.e. assimilation, Zionism and ghettoization, were not feasible, thus suggesting that God must have reasons for placing Jews in Christian societies. In 1936 an article quoted a fellow Jesuit to prove that Jews were \\"uniquely endowed with the qualities of parasites.Wills, P. 31; see Goldhagen \\"A Moral Reckoning\\", Abacus, 2003, p. 108 (fn. 118, p. 451) who expands these quotes citing \\"The Hidden Encyclical of Pius XI\\", Passelecq and Suchecky, pp. 123-136 A series of articles in 1937 expanded on the theme of Jews who were \\"a foreign body that irritates and provokes the reaction of the organism it has contaminated.\\" In 1937, \\"La Civilt√† Cattolica\\" reviewed a book by Hilaire Belloc summarising Belloc's view that the \\"Jewish problem\\" could only be solved by \\"elimination or segregation\\" (elimination did not include destruction). The reviewer rejected Belloc's option of expulsion (it being contrary to Christian charity) and also elimination by \\"a friendly and gentle manner, through absorption\\" since in his opinion it had \\"been shown to be historically unachievable.\\"Zuccotti, p. 13 Zuccotti notes the reviewer didn't dispute Belloc's proposal for \\"friendly segregation\\" based on Jews having a separate nationality but places it in the context of rights denied to the Jews when Mussolini imposed anti-Jewish laws in 1938.Zuccotti, p. 12‚Äì13Zuccotti further notes that when the Jesuit writer continues with a review of another work (\\"Israel, son passe, son avenir\\"), in which the reviewer rejects Zionism, he implicitly leaves the reader with Belloc's friendly segregation as the only solution, that which Hitler was already doing in Germany, and what Mussolini would introduce in 1938, p. 14 Zuccotti (2000) describes the language used in dealing with the \\"Jewish problem\\" as \\"ominous in retrospect\\".Zuccotti, p. 12-14 During the first half of 1937, the journal continued to run denunciations against the Jews but in the aftermath of the encyclical Mit brennender Sorge Father Mario Barbera (who had authored some of these strident attacks) for a brief period during the summer of 1937 changed course and, whilst repeating familiar accusations, called on Catholics to remove from their hearts any form of anti-Semitism and anything that might offend or humiliate Jews.Kertzer, p. 277‚Äì278 citing Mario Barbera, \\"La Question giudaica e l'apostolato cattolico\\", Civilta cattolica, 1937, III, pp. 27-39; Lapide cites 19 June edition \\"There is an urgent need to limit relations between Christians and Jews and to raise a barrier against the two perturbing Jewish preponderances: The materialistic-financial, and the revolutionary preponderances.\\" He would return to the older style of warnings a few months later.Kertzer, p. 278, Barbera refers to Jews and \\"their corrupt messianism, that is, their fatal craving for worldwide financial and political domination, is the true cause that makes Judaism a front of disorders and a permanent danger for the world.\\" His solution called for charity without persecutions and prudent measures \\"a kind of segregation or discrimination that is appropriate for our time; in short, a hospitality and peaceful coexistence, in a manner similar to that employed in the case of foreigners.\\" citing Mario Barbera \\"Intorno alla questione del sionismo\\", Civilta cattolica, 1938, II, pp. 76-82 The journal in 1938 wrote that Hungary could be saved from the Jews, who were \\"disastrous for the religious, moral, and social life of the Hungarian people\\", only if the government \\"forbids [Jewish] foreigners to enter the country\\".Wills, p.31; Kertzer, p. 278-279, noting how Father Barbera recalling how Jews in Hungary had praised the Pope for his stand against \\"racist neo-paganism\\", but adding, \\"that the Hungarian Catholics are not eager to have such allies for the Church.\\" and \\"Their nations instinctive and insufferable solidarity is enough for them to make common cause in carrying out their messianic aim of world domination.\\" From this perspective \\"Hungarian Catholics' anti-Semitism is thus neither vulgar, fanatic anti-Semitism, nor racist anti-Semitism. It is a movement in defense of national traditions and for the true liberty and independence of the Magyar people.\\" citing Mario Barbera, \\"Intorno alla questione del sionismo,\\", Civilita cattolica, 1938, II, pp. 76-82 In September 1938, three weeks after the Italian government marked all foreign Jews for expulsion and Jews were being harried and terrorised, the journal published and article asserting that \\"anti-Christian sectarians\\" who had granted Jews equality had brought together freemasonry and Judaism \\"in persecuting the Catholic Church and elevating the Jewish race over Christians as much in hidden power as in manifest opulence.\\"Wills, p. 38; Father Rosa in the same article wrote \\"Not all Jews are thieves, agitators, deceivers, usurers, freemasons, crooks and corrupters of morals. Everywhere, there is a certain number of them who are not accomplices in the evil actions of the others.\\", see Goldhagen, A Moral Reckoning, Abacus, 2003, p. 111, who also notes, p. 112, that his obituary in the journal testified that \\"It is no exaggeration to say that Father Enrico Rosa remained for thirty years at the head of Italian Catholic journalism as interpreter and intrepid champion of the directives of the Holy See.\\", see also Kertzer, p. 270 who cites D. Mondrone, \\"Il padre Enrico Rosa D. C. D. G., 'In memoria Patris,'\\", Civilita cattolica, 1938, IV, p. 485 In 1941 and 1942 the journal accused the Jews of being \\"Christ Killers\\" and being involved with ritual murder.Phayer, p. 8, citing \\"The Great Dilemma\\", Civita Catholica (December 1940):5; \\"The Actors in the Trial of Jesus\\", Civita Catholica (March 1942):394-397 Michael Phayer notes that the journal continued to publish \\"slander about the Jews even while they were being murdered en masse by German mobile killing squads.Phayer, p. 19 In 1971 Emmanuel Beeri (Encyclopaedia Judaica) noted that from the 1950s onwards Civilt√†'s attitude became more dispassionate in conformity with the Vatican's moves toward reconciliation between Jews and the Catholic Church. In his history of La Civilt√† Cattolica (2000), Father Giuseppe De Rosa expressed regret at the journals century-long campaign against the Jews and regret that the journal only changed its stance through the influence of the Second Vatican Council which sought reconciliation. (see Nostra aetate)Kertzer, p. 7 De Rosa drew a distinction between anti-Semitism based on race, which he believes the journal never sanctioned, and anti-Judaism based on religious factors which he acknowledges the journal did promote.Kertzer, p. 7‚Äì8 David Kertzer noted a disturbing trend in De Rosa's history of the journal, and also in We Remember the Shoah, that seeks to distance the Church from the Holocaust.Kertzer, p. 8 Kertzer pointed out that the anti-Judaism that the Church describes involved denunciation of the Jews not purely on religious grounds but also for socio-political reasons and thus says \\"the whole carefully constructed anti-Semitic/anti-Judaism distinction evaporates\\".Kertzer, p. 8-9 Kertzer subsequently reported that as part of the Vatican's attack on his book Unholy War, Civilita cattolica \\"dipped deep into the well of anti-Semitism to defend the Vatican from any involvement in the rise of modern anti-Semitism\\".\\"Anti-Semitism and the Vatican Today\\", Conference paper for \\"Old Demons, New Debates: Anti-Semitism in the West\\" Center for Jewish History, New York, 11‚Äì14 May 2003, quoted by Daniel Goldhagen in A Moral Reckoning, 2003, Abacus, p. 493, fn. 4,  See also  * Luigi Taparelli * Periodical publication * Holy See  References  ;Citations ;Bibliography   * *  Further reading  Much of the content of this article comes from the equivalent Italian-language wikipedia article.

It is a puzzle adventure game. Gameplay The object of the game is to successfully navigate the puzzles Dr. Brain has set up in order to become the mad scientist's assistant, a position Dr. Brain had advertised in the local classified section. To enter the castle, the player must play a game of memory at the front gate. Inside, the player must solve puzzles within the hallways and rooms of the castle. There are also three mazes in which the player must guide an elevator between and among different floors. Many of the puzzles require skill in mathematics and logic, but the game requires knowledge in a broad range of subjects. One puzzle requires the player to solve a cryptogram, and the penultimate level deals primarily with astronomy. In a rather surreal level, the player must put together a jigsaw puzzle which, when completed, becomes a room through which the player passes to go to the next level. Castle of Dr. Brain features a point-and-click mode of gameplay and three levels of difficulty, which the player can change at any time. The player can also change the pointer from a hand, which will interact with puzzles, to an eye, which will give information about an object, occasionally leading to clues to help solve puzzles. Typically, pointing the hand or the eye at an object that is not a puzzle will give a joke about it. The game also features Hint Coins, which the player earns by solving puzzles and can use for assistance on puzzles with which they are having difficulty. Development The proposal of Dr. Brain was an idea by Corey Cole. The game would become first in the Sierra Discovery series (which was established in 1992). Cole wanted to implement the elements of science and technology in an adventure game. Sierra gave him the okay to develop the game after he presented his concept to them. Many of Cole's inspirations came from games like Mastermind, Hangman and others. Reception In 1992, Dragon gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. Computer Gaming Worlds Charles Ardai praised Dr. Brain, calling the game \\"one of the most entertaining agglomerations of puzzles ever stuffed into a single package\\", so well constructed \\"that it has a real shot at converting puzzle haters into puzzle lovers\\".

He became a tutor in mathematics at Princeton University in 1832; he would later become professor of astronomy and mathematics and advocate for the construction of Princeton's first observatory. Alexander relied on the assistance of a free African American man named Alfred Scudder, who worked for him at Princeton during the 1850s. Because of his role as Alexander's assistant on campus, Scudder received the nickname \\"Assistant Professor of Natural Philosophy\\" from students. Alexander was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1850. In 1860, he was the head of the expedition to observe the solar eclipse in Labrador. He was one of the original members of the National Academy of Sciences in 1862, and a member of the American Philosophical Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He also served as the president of this last organization in 1859. His principal writings are \\"Physical Phenomena attendant upon Solar Eclipses\\", read before the American Philosophical Society in 1848; a paper on the \\"Fundamental Principles of Mathematics,\\" read before the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1848; another on the \\"Origin of the Forms and the Present Condition of some of the Clusters of Stars and several of the Nebulae\\", read before the American Association in 1850; others on the \\"Form and Equatorial Diameter of the Asteroid Planets\\" and \\"Harmonies in the Arrangement of the Solar System which seem to be Confirmatory of the Nebular Hypothesis of Laplace\\", presented to the National Academy of Science; and a \\"Statement and Exposition of Certain Harmonies of the Solar System\\", which was published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1875.

Blue and red were censored, covered up, thus yellow reigned supreme. But it really didn't matter if the kingdoms didn't like each other, for, you see, travel between the kingdoms was impossible. So they never came into contact. In isolation, each kingdom taught its young what to like and dislike. Other ideas were discouraged, but it couldn't last forever. In time, there came a new idea... a moving new idea... and the world would never be the same! WorldCat Synopsis In the Golden Kingdom, a young boy creates a flying golden ring, large enough to carry a man. Using it, he leaves the Golden Kingdom to explore the other lands. The Blue king sees him in his ring, leaving a trail of yellow light through the air, and gets an idea of his own; a blue hot air balloon, which his people can also use to visit the other lands! After he has seen enough of the Blue Kingdom, the Yellow boy lands in the Red kingdom and falls in love with the Red Princess, and she with him. He gives her his golden scarf, and in return, she gives him a red flower. When the Red guards see this yellow intruder, they attempt to detain him, but he escapes on his golden ring and heads back to the Golden Kingdom. Upon arriving, the Yellow queen hails him as a hero. But when he offers the red flower to her, she is offended, and the Yellow guards take the boy away. The Yellow queen then realizes that with the golden rings the boy has created, she can invade the other kingdoms. Back in the Red kingdom, the princess looks at the Golden Kingdom in the sky, pining for the Yellow boy. The Red king is concerned though, and does not approve of her feelings for him, as he fears for her safety. The Red king is then called away, and through a giant red telescope, he spots the Blue Kingdom and Golden Kingdom's soldiers and leaders coming to his land... with paintbrushes! He rallies his men, and they prepare for war. The Blue king is the first to arrive. The Red king peers at him through a periscope below the surface, and the Blue king smiles into it, offering to trade with the Reds. The periscope squirts him with red paint. Outraged at this treachery, the Blues retaliate, and begin to paint everything in sight blue. They then meet the Golden army, and their queen. The Blue king attempts to be diplomatic with them, but despite his many offers (A blue necklace, flowers, and a nightie), he only offends the queen and they attack, resulting in a very colorful three- way paint battle for supremacy between the Red, Blue, and Yellow army. Meanwhile, in the Golden Kingdom, the Yellow boy is being forced to make golden rings for the army. He manages to outsmart the slavemaster though, and escapes. Back at the front, the battle is still going colorful and strong. But when a volley of blue and yellow paint collides, green is created, and the soldiers from both sides stop fighting, very interested and happy at what they have created. The Golden queen will have none of it however, and commands her troops to continue fighting. The battle resumes. The Red army, using a giant fire hydrant, coats the whole area with red paint, and when it mixes with the other paints on the field, they discover orange and purple, and the soldiers from all sides again are entranced and overjoyed over these new ideas. However, all the fighting has not just created a huge mess. It has also created real danger. While standing on a bridge, the Red princess falls into the river, which is now flowing with paint from all three kingdoms. Before she can fall into the void between the worlds, she grabs the branch of a cliffside tree. When they see what their stupid war has caused, the soldiers of all three kingdoms throw down their paintbrushes and join forces to reach the princess. But as the Blue sentry reaches out to her and she attempts to reach out to him, the tree branch cracks, and she falls screaming into the void along with the colorful runoff of the battle. But just in time, the Yellow boy soars through the air on his ring, saving the princess, and splashing through the paint waterfall in the process. Now the ring leaves a trail of all colors, both primary and secondary, and the soldiers and kings are overjoyed at the sight of the very first rainbow, not to mention the rescue of the princess. The Blue King, though he looks skeptical at first at the rainbow, slowly smiles in appreciation of its beauty. The Yellow queen still wants to wage war, and once again commands her troops to keep fighting, but they ignore her commands and splash her with all the paint colors, thus deposing her as ruler. All celebrate, and the Blue King even has a rainbow painted on his clothes as they rejoice together. In the aftermath, all sides celebrate, trading colors with each other, combining their colors to make new colors, and reveling in the beauty of colors in harmony. Rainbow bridges are created to connect the three kingdoms, a symbol of the beauty that is created when all people come together. The Rainbow War has ended, and all kingdoms now live together, happily ever after.

The song was released exclusively on August 21, 2006 as a digital download. It is a style parody of \\"We Are the World\\", \\"Voices That Care\\", \\"Hands Across America\\", \\"Heal the World\\" and other similar charity songs. The song \\"describes the perils of online music file- sharing\\" in a tongue-in-cheek manner.Bill Plympton Studio To further the sarcasm, the song was freely available for streaming and download (legally) in \\"DRM-free\\" MPEG fileformat at Weird Al's Myspace page, as well as his YouTube channel. Background \\"Don't Download This Song\\" references several court cases related to the RIAA and copyright infringement of music. Among these are lawsuits against \\"a grandma\\" (presumably Gertrude Walton, who was sued for copyright infringement six months after dying) and a \\"7-year-old girl\\" (presumably a reference to Tanya Andersen's daughter sued at age 10 for alleged copyright infringements made at the age of 7), as well as Lars Ulrich's strong stance against copyright infringement of music in the days of Napster. The song also challenges the RIAA's claim that file sharing prevents the artists from profiting from their work, as the song argues that they are still very financially successful via their recording contracts: (\\"Don't take away money from artists just like me/How else can I afford another solid-gold Humvee, Or diamond-studded swimming pool? Those things don't grow on trees\\"). Mention is also made of Tommy Chong's time spent in prison. Yankovic's own views on filesharing are less clear-cut: Yankovic's intention was to leave the listener with no clear understanding of Yankovic's own views on the matter, \\"all by design\\". Music video The death scene from the music video. The music video, animated by Bill Plympton, premiered August 22, 2006 on Yahoo! Music. It depicts the vision of the capture, trial, imprisonment, attempted execution, escape, and burning of a young boy who burns a CD on his computer.Premieres on Yahoo! Music The boy's death, where he stands on top of a tower just before it explodes, parodies the film White Heat, where Cody Jarrett, played by James Cagney, dies in a similar fashion. Various people, from policemen to criminals to even sharks and dogs, are then seen celebrating throughout the ending chorus. But at the end, it turns out the boy is just imagining what would happen if he downloaded the song, so he throws away the burned CD and goes back to playing his guitar. Throughout the song, the video coloring gradually changes from color to grayscale to dark grayscale to yellowed. On MTV's MTV Music site where this music video is available, they have censored the names of the file sharing programs in the song, such as LimeWire or KaZaA. Weird Al explained that MTV contacted him and told him they would not air his video if the references to the filesharing programs were not in some way removed, so he \\"made the creative decision to bleep them out as obnoxiously as possible, so that there would be no mistake I was being censored.\\" The video was praised by the Annie Awards and was subsequently nominated for Best Animated Short Subject for its 34th ceremony, but was beat out by the Ice Age featurette, No Time for Nuts.

Early life Tess Wiley was born in Dallas, Texas in 1974 to a Christian family. Her mother was a poet Kathryn Wiley while her father was a musician Fletch Wiley, one of The Disciples. Tess's childhood was rather rough, she used to travel a lot from Houston to Seattle to San Francisco then back to Houston... She showed an interest in music and songwriting from an early age, adding \\"Create in Me a Clean Heart\\" and \\"Tender Shepherd\\" to her repertoire at the age of two. She began to play the piano at the age of five, then the violin at 12, and the guitar at 14. She wanted to make her musical style along the lines of hard rock guitarist Slash, but riffing soon gave way to contemplative songwriting. She spent her high school years singing in the band Nothing in Return while studying classical piano at the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Houston, Texas where she sang along with Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Career = Sixpence None the Richer = In 1995, Wiley joined the band Sixpence None the Richer on their European and American tours and wrote a mini-album Tickets For A Prayer Wheel as well as \\"Disconnect\\" for their second record, This Beautiful Mess. Wiley left the band shortly after the American tour in 1996. When Sixpence reunited in 2007, Wiley rejoined in 2008 and performed several shows including the European tour, but left shortly thereafter. = Solo career = After her departure from Sixpence, she began recording under the name \\"Splendora\\" but was kindly asked to abandon it because it was in copyright violation with the New York City group of the same name. She adopted \\"Phantasmic\\" name for her group when she was still dating Chris Colbert, who was a singer in Fluffy. Together, they agreed to change the name of the band to Xtra Fluffy and compiled a few songs along with Zachary Gresham of Southern Hymns. Eventually, she formed her own band, called Tess Wiley and Her Orchestra. She also lent her vocals to Velour 100 on the album Of Color Bright in 1997 and the following year recorded an album I Light Up Your Life as well as Debby Boone's You Light Up My Life. She also appeared in the Misfits' I Turned Into A Martian and sang many songs from the 70s and 80s of such singers as Michael Jackson, Pat Benatar, Sam Phillips, Nazareth and Level 42 among others. In the end of 2001 Tess had released her first album called Rainy Day Assembly which she recorded along with Gerry Leonard and David Bowie between June 1999 and January 2001 while living in New York City. She also was responsible for hiring a producer, Paul Bryan, who periodically invites her to town when he is with Aimee Mann. In 2003, Tess had relocated to Giessen, Germany where she had formed a band with Tim Potzas, Christian Weiss and Christian Pfaff. In 2004 her Not Quite Me album was launched in Germany which was her first attempt at recording alone and was released by Tapete Records. In 2007 she agreed with Tapete to release her another album, called Superfast Rock n' Roll Played Slow. In 2010 Tess had formed a duo band along with Elo von Knorre, whom she met at the church. During those times, she also written a German song \\"Licht Leuchte Auf\\" and had translated \\"My Fortress And My Shield\\", an inspiration of Psalm 42 from her Not Quite Me record. In 2011 she had sang for the Houses And Homes of Gregor McEwan and the same year recorded songs \\"How Much I Love You\\", \\"Rescue Me\\" and \\"Good, What We've Got\\". Tess plays alone, but if the place offers enough cash she invites either a drummer, a guitarist or a back vocal to play along in small clubs, restaurants, coffee bars and art initiatives. In 2013 her album Little Secrets was released by Nordpol which featured her song \\"Tornados\\". Personal life Wiley was married to Christian Roth, a photo-journalist; in 2005 they had their first son, Henry Fletcher Roth. In her spare time from music career she attends Free Evangelical Church.

To improve his skills he was asked to study in Europe for some time, which he did between 1838 and 1841. He studied with Justus Liebig in Giessen, where he finished his research on the benzoin condensation, which was discovered by Liebig several years before.

He was also the 5th Duke of Argyll in the Peerage of the United Kingdom and Lord Lieutenant of Argyll and Bute. In 1953, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. He served with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, earning the rank of captain. Following his military service he worked in banking, then spent four years as a sales executive with Rank Xerox Export, regularly travelling behind the Iron Curtain. In 1968 he took over running the dukedom's Inveraray Castle estate for his father. Family history The Campbell family descends from Gillespic Cambel, who some nine centuries ago acquired lands in the barony of Lochow, Co Argyll, by marriage to his cousin Aife, daughter and heir of Paul an Sporran, Royal Treasurer and last of the Clan O'Duin, descended of Diarmid. From the 13th century the Lochow Campbells held the title of Mac Cailein Mhor, Chief of Clan Campbell. In 1291, Sir Colin Campbell, of Lochow, was one of the nominees, on the part of Robert the Bruce, in the contest for the Crown of Scotland. Sir Duncan Campbell, of Lochow, became a Lord of Parliament as Lord Campbell under James II in 1445. His son Colin, the 2nd Lord Campbell, was created Earl of Argyll in 1457. The 10th Earl was advanced to the rank of Duke in the peerage of Scotland in 1701. Argyll was the son of Ian Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll, and his second wife, Louise Hollingsworth Morris Clews. On the death of his father in 1973, Argyll became a member of the Board of Directors of three distilleries and in 1977 became Chairman of Beinn Bhuidhe Holdings Ltd. in 1977.

As of 2007, its stated mission is \\"to defend and promote the civil and political rights of Chinese and Asian Americans within the context of, and in the interest of, advancing multiracial democracy in the United States\\". Major campaigns CAA represented the plaintiffs in Lau v. Nichols, a 1974 United States Supreme Court case expanding access to bilingual education. In 1978, CAA successfully advocated that the United States Census break down the single \\"Asian\\" category on the questionnaire into multiple distinct groups, to help better understand the Asian American population. In 1999, CAA helped advocate increased outreach in undercounted communities for the 2000 Census. From 1982 onwards, CAA was involved in the national campaign on behalf of Chinese-American hate crime victim Vincent Chin. In 2000, CAA helped organize a national coalition in support of Taiwanese-American scientist Wen Ho Lee. In 2003, Chinese for Affirmative Action, the Asian Pacific American Legal Center, and the Asian Law Caucus jointly launched Asian Americans for Civil Rights and Equality (AACRE), a Sacramento, California-based organization doing progressive Asian American state-level political advocacy. In 2014, Chinese for Affirmative Action supported the Senate Constitutional Amendment 5, an initiative would ask voters to consider eliminating California Proposition 209's ban on the use of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in recruitment, admissions, and retention programs at California's public universities and colleges. The debate over race-conscious admissions at public universities sharply divided Chinese American communities. CAA was one of the major organizations hitting back at xenophobia and racism related to the 2019‚Äì20 coronavirus pandemic in the United States. There were reports of over 1000 xenophobia and racism cases against Asian Americans between January 28 and February 24, 2020, which was during the first COVID-19 cases that were reported in the United States. Within one week after the \\"Stop AAPI Hate\\" website was launched, there were over 650 reports of discrimination that were mainly against Asian Americans. Funding In 2016, about half CAA's funding came from contracts, and the remainder from gifts and grants. Controversies = Asian admission quotas = In the 1990s, CAA sided with the San Francisco Unified School District in defending a consent decree that capped attendance at Lowell High School from any given racial group.

Donnelly Professorship of French and Comparative Literature.Richard Lane, Fifty Key Literary Theorists, p. 92 She specializes in 19th and 20th century French literature, psychoanalysis, trauma and testimony, and law and literature. Felman earned her Ph.D. at the University of Grenoble in France in 1970. Work Felman works in the fields of psychoanalytic literary criticism, performativity theory, feminism, Holocaust testimony, and other areas, though her writings frequently question, ironize, or test the limits of the very critical methods being employed. Often in her writing a reversal will occur so that the critical vocabulary gets subjected to and converted into the terms of the literary or cultural object being scrutinized rather than simply settling the meaning of the object; thus in Felman's style of criticism there is no fixed hierarchy of theory over and beyond the reach of the literary object.From early in her career Felman has been described as \\"represent[ing] an approach to writing which attempts to free the language of the literary text from the domination, mastery, and directives of 'literary criticism.'\\" Review by Robert C.

Listed on the Victorian Heritage Register on 14 July 1982, Raheen is owned by members of the Pratt family and is the principal Australian residence for Anthony Pratt. History The first section of Raheen was commenced in 1870 with an extension added in 1884. It was designed by William Salway and built for Edward Latham of the Carlton Brewery. Sir Henry Wrixon, prominent Melbourne barrister and solicitor, later owned and resided at the property. Raheen was constructed as a two-storey house in the Italianate style with a four-storey tower over the entrance and single-storey extension. It was designed in an asymmetric and arcaded form, and is built of red brick with cement render. The property retains its garden layout, including an Italianate garden, outbuildings, fence and gates, and internal features including the original stairwell, library, ballroom and cast iron tower stairs. In 1917 Raheen was purchased by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne and became the official residence of Archbishop Daniel Mannix, as well as four other Roman Catholic Archbishops of Melbourne. In 1981 the Church sold the property and it again reverted to a private residence. It was purchased in 1981 by the Australian businessman Richard Pratt and his family. Pratt and his wife, Jeanne, extensively renovated the house and gardens, including the addition of a new wing designed by Glen Murcutt. The house and gardens are occasionally opened for charitable events. Subsequent to Pratt's death in 2009, his son, Anthony, in 2016 initiated renovations to Raheen. Prior to the renovations, Raheen was assessed as having an approximate value of 100 million.  Historical significance  Raheen is of historic and architectural significance to the State of Victoria. Raheen is of historic importance because of its association with Melbourne's elite businessmen through Latham and Wrixon, and illustrates not only the importance of the brewery business and the legal profession in nineteenth century Melbourne, but also the importance of a residence in indicating success and status in society. The house is of historic importance through its association with the Catholic Church and illustrates the status sought by church hierarchy for Melbourne's Catholics and the Church prior to the mid-twentieth century. It is also historically important because of its association with Archbishop Dr Daniel Mannix who played a significant role within the Melbourne Archdiocese, as also in Melbourne politics particularly during the conscription debates of the First World War. Raheen is architecturally important in exhibiting an unusual integration of features in the combination of red brick and cement rendering. The house is architecturally important in exhibiting good design and aesthetic characteristics of the Italianate style, as well as in internal features and garden design.

Background Temperence Hill was a bay horse bred in Kentucky by Dr. Albert F. Polk, Jr.'s Oriskany Farm. He was sired by Stop The Music out of the Etonian mare, Sister Shannon. He was named for a 19th-century Arkansas Methodist church that his owner's ancestors attended. Temperence Hill was consigned to the 1978 Keeneland September yearling sale, where he was purchased and raced by Arkansas lumberman John Ed Anthony and his former wife, Mary Lynn Dudley under their Loblolly Stable colors. He was trained throughout his career by Joseph B. Cantey. Racing career After showing strong potential throughout the spring of 1980, with wins in Kentucky Derby prep races, the Rebel Stakes and Arkansas Derby, Temperence Hill's breakthrough performance came in the 1980 Belmont Stakes where he defeated Kentucky Derby winner Genuine Risk and Preakness Stakes winner Codex at odds of 53-1. He went on to win several additional Grade I stakes and was voted Champion three-year- old of 1980. Stud record Temperence Hill was retired after the 1981 racing season with career earnings of $1,567,650. He was syndicated and began his stallion career near Lexington, Kentucky at Gainesway Farm. In the early 1990s he was moved to Bonnerdale, Arkansas where he stood at D-Lan Farms and then Starr Farm. In the fall of 1996, he was sold to Thailand's only thoroughbred farm owner, Police General Sharlie Pekanan. Temperence Hill died peacefully in 2003 at SawangJai Farm 2 hours from Bangkok along the Friendship Highway near Bangkok, Thailand. In 16 seasons of breeding in North America, Temperence Hill sired 3 foreign champions, 39 stakes winners, and 433 winners from 602 starters with total earnings of $26,538,905. The best of his runners was Temperate Sil who won the 1986 Hollywood Futurity and in 1987, the Santa Anita Derby and the Swaps Stakes.

Early history Henry Harrison Jones - President San Diego Consolidated Gas & Electric 1910‚Äì1920. Director Panama-California Exposition (1915) Henry H. Jones, a civil, construction and electrical engineer, came to San Diego in 1910 as vice president and manager of the San Diego Consolidated Gas & Electric Company and became president shortly thereafter.McGrew, Clarence Alan; City of San Diego and San Diego County: The Birthplace of California, Volume 2, pg. 421 (1922). Henry Harrison Jones was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, March 31, 1874, son of Richard Hall and Ellen (Hughes) Jones. After graduating from high school in 1890 he was a bookkeeper at the Second National Bank, then entered Lehigh University to pursue a technical course. He graduated as a Civil Engineer in 1897, then for a year was a draftsman and assistant engineer for the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railroad Company in Springfield, Illinois, then a member of the general engineering staff of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Philadelphia until 1899, when he again went west. Until 1903 he was in Chicago as an assistant engineer of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad. For seventeen years his work was chiefly confined to traction and electric power engineering. He was general superintendent for the Springfield Railway & Light Company at Springfield, Illinois, until 1909, and before coming to San Diego was the manager of the Northern Idaho & Montana Power Company. In 1910 he accepted the post of vice president and manager of the San Diego Consolidated Gas & Electric Company. By 1920 the company furnished gas and electric service to San Diego city and forty adjacent towns and districts as far north as San Juan Capistrano in Orange County, and south to the Mexican border. When Jones took the management of the company in 1910 it had less than six thousand electric customers and less than nine thousand gas customers, while the number of customers in each branch in 1920 numbered nearly twenty-seven thousand. The quantity measure of service increased in proportion, necessitating the investment of millions of dollars in new equipment and distribution systems. The company in 1920 had five hundred and thirty miles of gas main and over seven hundred miles of electric poll lines. Mr. Jones served as a director and member of the executive committee during the Panama-California Exposition (1915), whose group was responsible for the designing, creation and building the first, original structures and buildings in Balboa Park, San Diego, California. United States v. San Diego Gas & Electric The Encanto Gas Holder was a natural gas holding station composed of over of underground pipe on about of land in Lemon Grove, adjacent to the city of San Diego. First brought online in the mid-1950s, the Encanto Gas Holder was decommissioned in 2000-2001 by San Diego Gas and Electric, Sempra Energy as the agent of SDG&E;, and the IT Corporation as the main contractor for the decommissioning. TriState was brought on board to abate strips of asbestos-containing pipe coating for another contractor to cut the holder bottle into sections. TriState was later tasked with stripping the coating at the gas holder site despite employee and nearby residents' concerns over friable asbestos generated as a byproduct of the gross stripping processes employed by SDG&E; contractors.US Attorney's press release In 2006, SDG&E; was indicted by U.S. Attorney Carol C. Lam in the Southern District of California on five counts, including conspiracy, fraud, and three counts of mishandling regulated asbestos-containing materials in violation of the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. Additional defendants included SDG&E;'s director of environmental compliance, an uncertified asbestos removal consultant, and the IT Corporation project manager. Charges were dismissed without prejudice in November 2006, but the defendants were re-indicted in early 2007 on nearly identical charges, and the case was heard in San Diego's federal court in June and July 2007. On July 13, 2007, three guilty verdicts were returned against defendants SDG&E;, IT Corporation project manager Kyle Rhuebottom, and SDG&E; environmental specialist David \\"Willie\\" Williamson, including false statements, failure to provide adequate notice to government agencies of regulated asbestos on the site, and violating asbestos work practice standards to avoid the cost of lawful environmental compliance. SDG&E; environmental director Jacquelyn McHugh was found not guilty, and defense attorneys vowed to appeal for unjust prosecution. In late 2007 U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ruled that SDG&E; and the workers deserved a new trial. Criminal charges were dismissed against SDG&E; on October 6, 2009. 2008 marine helicopter crash lawsuit On September 3, 2008 a jury awarded $55.6 million to the families of four United States Marine aviators killed when their UH-1 helicopter crashed into a 130-foot-tall SDG&E; utility tower at Camp Pendleton. The amount awarded included $15.2 million in compensatory damages and $40.4 million in punitive damages. The jury held SDG&E; responsible for $9.48 million of the compensation amount and all of the punitive damages.Perry, Tony, \\"$55 Million Awarded In Marine Air Crash\\", Los Angeles Times, September 4, 2008, p. B3. During the trial, the plaintiffs argued that SDG&E; was negligent in its policy of placing warning lights only on towers over in height. The company said the power line had been on the base for 25 years and that SDG&E; would have installed lights if the Marine Corps had asked. Since the crash, the company has installed lights, said Todd Macaluso, the lawyer for the families. SDG&E; said that it would appeal the judgment. 2011 county-wide power outage On September 8, 2011, at 3:38 PM Pacific Standard Time, a major power outage left all 1.4 million SDG&E; customers without power. The problems started with a fault in an Arizona Public Service substation near Yuma, Arizona that caused widespread problems in western Arizona and eastern California. In time, SDG&E;'s system was drawing from the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) considerably more power than was being produced, pulling it from Los Angeles, and a \\"safety net\\" system cut it off from the nuclear plant. Once this happened, SDG&E;'s system rapidly collapsed due to mismatch of generation and load, unable to drop load faster than generation was lost. SDG&E; implemented their system restoration plan and cautioned its customers to expect a prolonged outage.Vives & Blankstein, \\"1.4 million without power; electricity may not be fully restored until Friday\\", Los Angeles Times, September 8, 2011 The outage appears to have been caused by the actions of an employee at APS's North Gila substation in Arizona, and it is unknown why safeguards did not keep the outage limited to the Yuma area.Damon Gross, Cause of Widespread Outage Under Investigation; APS Works to Restore Service to Customers in Yuma Area , APS News Release, September 8, 2011. Accessed September 9, 2011 By Friday morning on the 9th, power had been restored to all 1.4 million SDG&E; customers. 2020 Emmanuel Cafferty firing controversy In the wake of the 2020 George Floyd protests and the subsequent attention brought onto topics related to racism and white supremacy, SDG&E; became the center of national controversy when it fired one of its employees, Emmanuel Cafferty, for allegedly displaying the OK gesture, a sign that had recently become associated with the alt-right and white power movement.https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/sdge-worker-fired-over- alleged-racist-gesture-says-he-was-cracking-knuckles/2347414/ Cafferty claimed that he was unaware of the connotations of the sign he was displaying.https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/stop-firing- innocent/613615/. The story of Cafferty's termination was covered by national news publications and periodicals, and while SDG&E; has remained silent on the matter, it has faced scrutiny from the public, as seen in numerous social media messages and the creation of a Change.org petition with over 11,000 signatures in support of Cafferty's reinstatement, and journalists over what is seen as a wrongful termination.https://www.theblaze.com/news/fired-racist- gesture-cracking-knuckleshttps://medium.com/recording-the-revolution/fired- emmanuel-cafferty-d4f7533eb8b6 References =Further reading= * External links * Wecc.biz * Stirlingenergy.com Category:Energy in California Category:Sempra Energy Category:Electric power companies of the United States Category:Natural gas companies of the United States Category:Companies based in San Diego Category:Non-renewable resource companies established in 1881 Category:1881 establishments in California ","title":"San Diego Gas &amp; Electric"},{"id":"6600913","text":"TICCIT (an acronym for Time-shared, Interactive, Computer-Controlled Information Television) was first developed by the MITRE Corporation in 1968 as an interactive cable television (CATV) system. From June, 1971 through July, 1972 MITRE demonstrated a number of potential social, commercial, governmental, and educational interactive services through the Reston, Virginia cable television system. The original system created computer generated frames, converted to NTSC color signals, that subscribers could interact with on their television sets through a touch-tone telephone. In December, 1971, the National Science Foundation (NSF) Technological Innovations Group granted a contract to MITRE to further develop the TICCIT system as a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) system for community colleges. MITRE subcontracted with the CAI Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin and also with the Department of Instructional Research, Development, and Evaluation of Brigham Young University to refine the user interface and create the massive amounts of courseware needed to teach a complete college- level English and algebra course. A trial implementation of the English and algebra courseware took place through the 1975-77 school years, and was evaluated by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). TICCIT installations ran on a Data General Nova minicomputer that could support over 100 simultaneous users. Participating community colleges were Northern Virginia Community College in Alexandria, Virginia, and Phoenix College in Phoenix, Arizona. Following the end of the NSF-funded project, the Hazeltine Corporation acquired the rights to commercialize the TICCIT system, which they did for several years, selling systems to military, industrial, and educational customers. With the advent of the personal computer, Hazeltine released an updated version of TICCIT, known as MicroTICCIT. Courseware developed over the years for TICCIT included algebra, chemistry, Danish, English (grammar, mechanics, spelling, and composition), English as a second language (ESL), French, German, humanities, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, physics, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, and Thai. Later projects at Brigham Young University adapted material authored for TICCIT to Apple II computers, DOS PCs, and eventually DVDs. One of the major innovations of the TICCIT system was the architecture of its instruction. A standard set of displays was provided for each segment of subject-matter (representing one or more instructional objectives). The definition of the display set was based on the Component Display Theory of M. David Merrill. The goal of this arrangement was to place moment-to-moment control of instruction in the hands of the learner. A special keypad was provided for learners to the right of the standard keyboard keys. This provided keys for each instructional display type as well as for other administrative and navigational functions. Using these keys a learner could navigate freely through the displays provided within a segment and manage the instructional session itself. Help and Advice keys were provided, and computer-chosen instructional sequencing was available if the learner's chose. The U.S. Marine Corps Communications/Electronics School at MCB 29 Palms, California, used a TICCIT system for courses in its schools in the 1980s. Electronics-related courseware and data communications operations were the primary focus of system use.

His credits also include building both the first compound steam engine for marine use and the first New York City tenement structure.Who Was Who in America: Historical Volume, 1607-1896. Chicago: Marquis Who's Who, 1963. Life and career Allaire was born either in his family's ancestral home city of New Rochelle, New York, or under self- preserving exile in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, Canada. A large number of \\"Tory\\" Loyalist individuals and families fled New York to Canada during the British evacuation of New York after the Paris Peace Treaty of 1783 ended the United States War of Independence, including branches of the Allaire Family that took residence in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia. Petitions to the Continental Congress in 1784 by a Peter A. Allaire of New York, a Colonial American Loyalist, indicates a high probability that the relevant branch of the Allaire family may have remained in New York during and after the British evacuation. Sometime after 1793, the Allaire patriarch purchased a house in New York City, and found work as a livery stabler. In 1802, at the age of 17, his oldest son, James Peter, began working for Francis Elsworth, a brass founder in the city. Allaire would marry Frances Duncan, a distant cousin, two years later, and he continued to advance at the brass foundry. They would eventually have nine children, five of whom lived to adulthood. By 1806, having learned the brass business, Allaire opened his own foundry. Before the War of 1812, Allaire‚Äôs foundry received an order from Robert Fulton to make the brass works for the Clermont, the first commercially successful steamboat. After Fulton‚Äôs death in 1815, Allaire leased that gentleman‚Äôs Jersey City, NJ shop and tolls from the estate. He then took as a partner Charles Soutinger, Fulton‚Äôs chief engineer. Under that partnership, Allaire and Stoutinger built the engine for Fulton‚Äôs last steamship design, the Chancellor Livingston, as well as the air cylinder for the Savannah, the first steam powered vessel to successfully cross the Atlantic. When Soutinger died shortly thereafter, Allaire removed the business to Corlear‚Äôs Hook in lower Manhattan where his brass foundry was located. By 1820, Allaire was operating that largest marine engine building shop in the United States. He personally held a number of patents for steam engine improvements developed at his shop, which was known as the James P. Allaire Works. During the War of 1812, an embargo on British products and goods caused businessmen like Allaire much difficulty in procuring the resources needed for America's fledgling industrial base. For Allaire, the embargo created a scarcity of iron stock necessary for his manufacturing operations and led him to look at acquiring a satisfactory means of assuring a steady, inexpensive supply of raw materials. What initially interested Allaire in the property now known as Historic Allaire Village was the presence of significant quantities of bog iron ore. This bog ore, so called because of its formation in marshes and swampy areas, was a valuable resource in America before the discovery of vast ore deposits in the mountains of Northern New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Unlike the latter ore, bog ore is easily accessible and requires no deep shaft or strip mining to get it. More significantly, bog ore is a renewable resource when mined and utilized with care. It is produced when rain water leaches out humic and tannic acids and carbon dioxide, which is produced as a part of the natural life-cycle of microorganisms in the soil. Part of this leachate consists of iron particles from deeper in the soil. As the water passes through these areas of loamy soil, also called marl, it deposits a solution of iron carbonate which rises up to the surface. This iron carbonate then combines with the surface soil and, over time, hardens into a solid mass. This process only takes about 25 to 35 years, making it an ideal, almost perpetual resource for industry but only if treated with respect. If the ore bed is left undeveloped and unpolluted, the beds can be mined indefinitely. Farther south in New Jersey, the operators of furnaces were forced to purchase ore from Staten Island, New York, because the ore beds had been over-mined.Allaire Village, Inc.

Originally built as a real tennis court, it was used as a playhouse from 1660 to 1663, shortly after the English Restoration. As a theatre, it has been variously called the \\"Theatre Royal, Vere Street\\", the \\"Vere Street Theatre\\", or (as in Samuel Pepys' diary) simply \\"The Theatre\\". It was the first permanent home for Thomas Killigrew's King's Company and was the stage for some of the earliest appearances by professional actresses. The theatre was destroyed by fire in 1809. The London School of Economics, which covers most of Clare Market nowadays, retains some squash and real tennis courts in its older buildings.  Tennis-court theatres  Tudor-style real tennis courts were long, high-ceiling buildings, with galleries for spectators; their dimensions -- about 75 by 30 feet -- are similar to the earlier theatres, and much larger than a modern tennis court.Styan, John (1996). The English Stage: A History of Drama and Performance. Cambridge University Press. p. 238. The tennis courts were not used exclusively for tennis. In 1653, seven years before it saw lawful use as a theatre, an underground production of Killigrew's Claricilla was planned for Gibbon's court. The production was broken up before it debuted, reportedly betrayed to the army by one of the actors.Clare, Janet. (2004). \\"Theatre and Commonwealth\\". Milling and Thomson The Cambridge History of British Theatre. Cambridge University Press. p. 462. Thomas Killigrew's acting troupe performed in a remodeled Gibbon's Tennis Court from 1660 to 1663. After the English Restoration in 1660, Charles II granted Letters Patent to two companies to perform \\"legitimate drama\\" in London: the Duke's Company under the patronage of the Duke of York, led by William Davenant, and the King's Company, led by Thomas Killigrew. Both companies briefly performed in the theatrical spaces that had survived the interregnum and civil war (including the Cockpit and the Red Bull), but scrambled to quickly acquire facilities that were more to current tastes. Killigrew and Davenant both chose a solution that had been used in France: converting tennis courts into theatres. Killigrew's remodelled Gibbon's Tennis Court opened first, on 8 November 1660, just two months after being given permission by the Crown.Langhans, Edward (2000). \\"The theatre\\". Fisk, Deborah The Cambridge Companion to English Restoration Theatre. Cambridge University Press. p. 2. The design was similar to the earlier Elizabethan-era \\"private\\" theatres, such as the theatre in Blackfriars: a stage devoid of scenery facing a bench-filled pit on the auditorium floor and surrounded by one or two levels of U-shaped galleries.  Competition  Not long after the opening, on 20 November, avid theatre-goer Samuel Pepys attended his first performance at Vere Street: > ‚Ä¶Mr. Shepley and I to the new Play-house near Lincoln‚Äôs-Inn-Fields (which > was formerly Gibbon‚Äôs tennis-court), where the play of Beggar‚Äôs Bush was > newly begun; and so we went in and saw it, it was well acted: and here I saw > the first time one Moone,Actor Michael Mohun. who is said to be the best > actor in the world, lately come over with the King, and indeed it is the > finest play-house, I believe, that ever was in England.The Diary of Samuel > Pepys, Tuesday 20 November 1660. Pepys' high praise for the theatre is often taken to reflect his excitement regarding London's burgeoning theatrical scene rather than as commentary than on the quality of the tennis-court theatre itself. John Styan says it \\"seems a questionable statement about so makeshift a theatre.\\"Styan, John. (1986). Restoration Comedy in Performance. Cambridge University Press. p. 19. Killigrew's competition, Davenant, would take another seven months to open his new theatre in nearby Lisle's Tennis Court; working more from the model of court masque venues such as Inigo Jones‚Äô Cockpit-in-Court, he equipped it with a stage complete with a proscenium arch and moveable scenery, painted onto a series of sliding panels. Opening in late June, 1661, Davenant's theatre would steal much of Vere Street's thunder. Before then, though, Killigrew would generate some more excitement of his own, by being the first to stage plays with actresses, instead of actors, playing female roles. The first occasion, based on its newly-written prologue, is thought to have been a performance of Othello on 8 December 1660; authorities differ as to the name of the actress who played Desdemona.Latham, Robert and Matthews, William (1995).

He is the bestselling author of Bangkok 8 and its sequels, Bangkok Tattoo, Bangkok Haunts, The Godfather of Kathmandu, and Vulture Peak. His most recent novel in this series, The Bangkok Asset, was published on 4 August 2015. Biography Burdett was born in London, England, the son of a London policeman. Burdett is a former lawyer who practised in Hong Kong. As of 2007, he split his time between southwestern France and Bangkok. Novels =The Last Six Million Seconds= Set in Hong Kong in April and May 1997, just before the British turnover of the territory to mainland China, this novel deals with a horrific murder investigation. Three severed heads are found in a floating garbage bag on the maritime border between Hong Kong territory and China. Fortunately, they match the three DNA profiles found in a vat of minced human meat that had been abandoned in a warehouse. Political implications of the crime may complicate the turnover, and political pressure is brought both to halt the investigation and to hurry it. The detective, a half-Chinese half-Irish HK resident, finds himself threatened by both sides‚Äîall the more so when a WMD smuggling plot that threatens to force outright war between Britain and China is uncovered. =The Sonchai Jitpleecheep Series= A series of crime novels mainly set in Bangkok, they consist of six books: Bangkok 8, Bangkok Tattoo, Bangkok Haunts, The Godfather of Kathmandu, Vulture Peak, and The Bangkok Asset. They centre on the philosophical Thai Buddhist detective, Sonchai Jitpleecheep, and his meditative internal dialogues. Sonchai is a \\"leuk krung\\" or half-caste. He is the son of a former \\"rented-wife\\" (a type of prostitute) and a \\"farang.\\" His father was a U.S. military officer whom he never knew. Sonchai has spent much of his childhood in Europe and the U.S.. A born \\"outsider\\", he is also seemingly unbribeable, which increases his alienation from his colleagues. The novels involve Thailand's sex industry and the red-light districts of Bangkok. Sexual matters are part of the narrative, including the juxtaposition of often conflicting Thai and Western norms and mores. They have been widely praised for the breadth and depth of understanding of a number of different cultures. Apart from the Anglo-Saxon cultural traditions with which he was brought up, Burdett has shown considerable familiarity with Confucian, Buddhist, Latin and North African societies, due to his extensive travels. The novels contain larger-than-life characters intertwined with a wry sense of humour and bizarre crimes. The crimes include execution by the release of a container full of cobra snakes into a car where the driver is forcibly prevented from escaping (Bangkok 8), the theft of valuable tattoos (and their associated human skin) off the backs' of murder victims (Bangkok Tattoo), and homicide related to the production of a snuff video (Bangkok Haunts). Juxtaposed is the investigative nonchalance and Buddhist acceptance of an \\"arhat\\" detective who can meditate even in a Bangkok traffic-jam. Many popular shamanistic superstitions that have carried over into Buddhism in Thailand are explored. Past lives (reincarnation) and hungry ghosts also contribute to the atmosphere and texture. Film All of Burdett's published books have been optioned for films, but due to the exotic location and multi-racial characters, film makers have found it difficult to find appropriate 'stars' and screenplays. Bangkok 8 was optioned by Millennium Films, which produced the fourth movie in the Rambo series in Thailand, and is serious about making the film according to Burdett.At Home Amid the Red Lights, The New York Times, 25 October 2007 Producer John Thompson scouted locations in Bangkok, and James McTeigue, the director of V for Vendetta, had been hired to direct, but production looks to have been cancelled.http://www.beyondhollywood.com/2007/06/james-mcteigue-to- direct-bangkok-8/ Published works *A Personal History of Thirst, William Morrow & Co (February 1996), *The Last Six Million Seconds, Hodder & Stoughton (2 January 1997), *Bangkok 8: A Novel, Alfred A.

The organization closed in December 2008 but reopened in April 2013. History The original Equality Mississippi logo The second logo of Equality Mississippi Equality Mississippi (EM) was founded in response to the murder of Jamie Ray Tolbert, a Laurel, Mississippi native and referred to as a friend by EM founder and executive director Jody Renaldo. Alt URL Tolbert was a gay man visiting the now defunct gay nightclub Joey's On The Beach in Biloxi, Mississippi on New Year's Eve 1999. He was abducted from the bar's parking lot. His body was later found in the woods in Alabama, having been beaten and strangled. His killers, Brent David Kabat and Jeremy Shawn Bentley, were arrested two weeks later after being stopped at a roadblock in California. They were still driving Tolbert's Nissan Xterra. It's not clear if the crime was in any way related to the victim's sexuality. The organization's original name was Mississippi Gay Lobby as it was the first chapter of the National Gay Lobby (NGL). NGL's approach to activism was that of being an Internet-only gay rights organization using its membership to send activism e-mails, letters to the editor and forum postings. After a year of being a chapter of NGL, the state chapter became independent, still keeping their name, because it felt the need to be active beyond Internet activism, felt the $25 membership dues should not be sent for nationwide activities and disagreed with a recent protest action discouraging users from using AOL.  Notable events  California Proposition 8 in Jackson, Mississippi on November 15, 2008. In 2001 the group ran a television advertisement campaign designed to bring attention to LGBT issues in Mississippi. The advertisements were aired on local cable channels MTV, VH1 and Lifetime. Also, in 2002, Equality Mississippi partnered with the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi to publish the Mississippi Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights Series, a three booklet series covering how Mississippi law affected the lives of gay and lesbian Mississippians. =Amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court= In 2003, Equality Mississippi submitted an amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas. In the case, the Court struck down a Texas state law banning private consensual sex between adults of the same sex in a decision gay rights groups hailed as historic. The ruling invalidated anti-sodomy laws in 12 other states, including Mississippi. =Boycott of Gulfport= In 2003, after the Gulfport city council passed a resolution condemning the United States Supreme Court for striking down sodomy laws in the United States, Equality Mississippi began what it called the \\"Not One Dime\\" campaign, a nationwide boycott campaign against the tourist destination city. = Hurricane Katrina efforts = Following the destruction brought to the Mississippi Gulf Coast by the Hurricane Katrina, EM began providing emergency relief to gay and lesbian Mississippians who were uncomfortable in seeking help from religious organizations providing aid. Incidents of discrimination and harassment of LGBT hurricane evacuees were present and reported. The Union for Reform Judaism recommended and later provided $10,000 to EM to support their relief efforts. =Criticism of the American Family Association= In August 2001, Equality Mississippi issued a press release critical of the American Family Association (AFA), whose world headquarters is also based in Mississippi, for what it perceived as a boycott against the Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) (purportedly because the GSUSA does not ban lesbian scouts or lesbian scout leaders). Equality Mississippi felt the AFA's actions of promoting American Heritage Girls as the \\"Christian alternative\\" to the GSA was because of the gay community's boycott against the Boy Scouts of America for its ban of gay scouts and gay scout leaders.  Closing and reforming Equality Mississippi posted a bulletin on MySpace stating that as of December 3, 2008, the Board of Directors decided, due to financial hardships, the organization was to be closed. Four years later in April 2013, an organization having no association with the original organization or its original founder, formed and began operations using the same Equality Mississippi name.

He obtained his university degree from the University of Toronto in 1914. He spent two years in residence at the Toronto General Hospital. During World War I, Drake was a medical officer. After the war he went back to the Toronto General Hospital where he eventually became head of the research institute. Medical accomplishments In 1923, he, along with Dr. Alan Brown and Dr. Frederick Tisdale, helped work out the formula for Pablum. The cereal marked a breakthrough in nutritional science: it helped prevent rickets, a crippling childhood disease, by ensuring that children have enough vitamin D in their diet. Although Pablum was not the first food designed and sold specifically for babies, it was the first baby food to come pre-cooked and thoroughly dried. The ease of preparation made Pablum successful in an era when infant malnutrition was still a major problem in industrialized countries. During World War II, Drake designed nutritional diets for RCAF personnel as well as for POW parcels. After the war, he was named a member of the Order of the British Empire for his work. Personal life Drake met his first wife, Gerturd Salmond, overseas. She predeceased him by 15 years. His second wife was Nina Johnson. Drake was interested in the history of pediatric care. He began a collection of art and artifacts related to the history of children's health. Over 3000 artifacts and 1000 prints formed a base of his collection.

It was written by Pete McCormack and directed by Jim Wilson.  Plot summary  The Whirlygirl (Mazur) is a professional exotic dancer that travels to all-male schools and entertains her audiences. Raol, a student at such a school, makes contact with her and she agrees to visit his school. Raol enlists the aid of his friend James Edwards (Morris) to formulate plans for a successful event that will feature the Whirly Girl. The party goes off without a hitch and the boys celebrate and praise James for his efforts. During the celebration, though, James realizes that his dead dad's watch has gone missing and suspects the Whirlygirl has stolen it. He tracks down Alice (the actual name of the Whirly Girl) to her New York City apartment and confronts her. He recovers his watch and divulges its sentimental value to Alice. During this confrontation, James and Alice make a connection and the remainder of the film follows the growth of their relationship, which endures a number of trials. Along the way, Alice helps the typically strait-laced, obedient James take more risks -- which in the film includes skipping school, partying, and dodging police officers. Reciprocating, James helps the wild Alice reconnect with her family, end her scandalous relationships, and realize her dream of becoming a professional (non-exotic) dancer. Late in the film, James faces expulsion from his school for his unusual behavior and repeatedly skipping class. Alice comes to his rescue and persuades the school to give him a second chance. At its conclusion, Alice decides to leave her former life behind and start fresh in another town. She invites James, but he decides it's best to finish his education first. As a memento of their experiences together, James gives Alice his watch and Alice promises to one day return it.

He was a Member of Parliament and Director of the International Centre for Ethnic Studies. On 29 July 1999, Tiruchelvam was assassinated. The militant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam was widely blamed for the assassination, and the assassination received condemnation from around the world. In 2001 he was posthumously awarded the Law and Society Association first International Prize for \\"his distinguished scholarship in legal pluralism, human rights, constitutionalism, ethnic conflict, and the capacity of law to contain violence\\". He has also received posthumous recognition by the Train Foundation's Civil Courage Prize. Early life and family Tiruchelvam was born on 31 January 1944. He was the son of M. Tiruchelvam, a leading lawyer, and Punithavathy. He was educated at Royal College, Colombo. He entered the Department of Law at the University of Ceylon, Colombo, graduating with a LL.B. degree. He then proceeded to Harvard Law School from where he received M.A. and J.S.D. degrees. Tiruchelvam married Sithie. They had two sons (Nirgunan and Mithran). Legal career Tiruchelvam was called to the bar as an advocate in 1968. He took over his father's legal practice and in 1982, he established the law firm Tiruchelvam Associates with his wife Sithie Tiruchelvam. He was a member of the Law Commission. He was made a President's Counsel in February 1998. Tiruchelvam held several academic positions in Sri Lanka and the USA. He was Fulbright Fellow (1969‚Äì71) and fellow in law and modernization at Yale Law School (1972‚Äì74). He was then reader at the Faculty of Law, University of Sri Lanka Colombo campus and Edward Smith Visiting Fellow and Lecturer at Harvard Law School. Tiruchelvam was director of the Colombo-based International Centre for Ethnic Studies (ICES). He became a member of the London-based Minority Rights Group International (MRG) in 1994 and was elected its chair in 1999. He had been an international observer in several countries, including Pakistan, Chile, Kazakhstan, Ethiopia, South Africa and Nigeria. Political career On 1 August 1982 T. Thirunavukarasu, the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) MP for Vaddukoddai, died and on 14 October 1982 the TULF nominated Kuttimani (Selvarajah Yogachandran), a leading member of the militant Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), to be his replacement. Kuttimani was at that time in prison awaiting trial on charges related to the Neervely bank robbery. There was dispute as to whether Kuttimani was eligible to be an MP and on 24 January 1983 Kuttimani \\"resigned\\" from Parliament, never having taken oath. The TULF subsequently nominated Tiruchelvam to be Thirunavukarasu's replacement. Tiruchelvam took his oath in on 8 March 1983. Tiruchelvam and all other TULF MPs boycotted Parliament from the middle of 1983 for a number of reasons: they were under pressure from Sri Lankan Tamil militants not to stay in Parliament beyond their normal six-year term; the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka required them to swear an oath unconditionally renouncing support for a separate state; and the Black July riots in which up to 3,000 Tamils were killed by Sinhalese mobs. After three months of absence, Tiruchelvam forfeited his seat in Parliament on 22 October 1983. After the Black July riots many TULF leaders went into exile but Tiruchelvam stayed in Colombo. Tiruchelvam was appointed as the TULF's National List MP in Parliament following the 1994 parliamentary election. Tiruchelvam, along with G. L. Peiris, were the lead authors of President Chandrika Kumaratunga's 1995 constitutional reform and devolution plan (also known as the \\"GL-Neelan Package\\" or \\"The New Deal\\"). The plan involved turning Sri Lanka from a unitary state into a \\"union of regions\\", merging of the Northern and Eastern provinces, expanding the subjects devolved to provincial councils, establishment of a mechanism to resolve disputes between the central and provincial governments and greater recognition of Sri Lanka's many minorities. The plan went beyond the Thirteenth Amendment and was federalism in all but name. The plan, which was released on 3 August 1995, was generally welcomed both in Sri Lanka and abroad but was attacked by Sinhalese nationalists and Tamil militants. The plan was subsequently watered down so much that even the TULF refused to support it and the plan was never implemented. =Assassination= On the morning of 29 July 1999 Tiruchelvam was on his way to office at Kynsey Terrace, Colombo when, around 9.10 a.m., a man threw himself onto Tiruchelvam's car near the Kynsey Road-Rosemead Place Junction, detonating an explosive which killed both Tiruchelvam and the assassin. Thiruchelvam's driver, bodyguard and three policemen in an escort jeep behind the car were also injured. The militant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam was widely blamed for the assassination. The assassination received condemnation from around the world. In 2001 Tiruchelvam was posthumously awarded the Law and Society Association first International Prize for \\"his distinguished scholarship in legal pluralism, human rights, constitutionalism, ethnic conflict, and the capacity of law to contain violence\\".

J.P. (January 3, 1746February 7, 1805) was a Canadian politician who became an officer with the Massachusetts Militia in the American Revolutionary War. He served under George Washington during the Revolutionary War as Superintendent of the Eastern Indians and Colonel of Infantry, and he recruited Indian tribes of Eastern Maine to stand with the Americans during the war and participated in border negotiations between Maine, and New Brunswick. Early life and education Allan was born in Edinburgh Castle in Scotland, the son of Major William Allan (military officer) (1720 ‚Äì1790), 'a Scottish gentleman of means and an officer in the British Army', and his wife Isabella, daughter of Sir Eustace Maxwell.p. 218 The Allan family temporarily resided in Edinburgh Castle where they had sought refuge during the Jacobite rising of 1745, under the Deputy Governor, General George Preston, Commander-in-Chief of Scotland. After the end of the War of the Austrian Succession, many British officers including Colonel Allan's father were discharged from service. William Allan was then offered a position in the British colony of Nova Scotia, which had previously been in French possession and he moved there with his family in 1749. William Allan arrived in the City of Halifax, Nova Scotia, in a military capacity, where the family remained for ten years before moving to Fort Lawrence. The fall of French Quebec and the arrival of British officers like William Allan displaced French Acadians and Native American tribes, creating violence and conflict. The British took land away from Native Americans and French Acadians and gifted it to people like William Allan. French Acadians probably worked menial jobs on William Allan's large farm for little pay. Given William Allan's background, it is surprising that his son became such an advocate for American independence. Several factors in young John Allan's childhood may have contributed to his patriotic views. John Allan was sent to Massachusetts to receive an education, as were many young sons of wealthy British officers and landowners, because Nova Scotia was still relatively unsettled. He learned as a child both French and some Native American dialects. Both of these language skills would prove crucial for success in his later endeavors. Colonel John Allan's education in Massachusetts was likely a large factor in his support for the American patriots over the British, because at that time, Boston, Massachusetts was arguably the center of patriotic fervor. Another factor is that after the Proclamation of 1763, many New Englanders migrated to areas in Nova Scotia, such as Fort Lawrence, where Colonel John Allan grew up. Patriotic sentiment among his Bostonian neighbors in Nova Scotia could have influenced his political leanings. Also, Nova Scotia was geographically close to New England, which was the center of patriotic resistance. It was also dependent on New England for many supplies and ammunition. Regular contact with New Englanders imbued with patriotic fervor could have caused Allan to differ so strongly from his father's views. Colonel John Allan eventually became estranged from his father. This estrangement was likely due to an irreconcilable difference of view concerning the Revolutionary War.  Contributions to the Revolutionary War  After his schooling, Colonel John Allan moved back to Halifax and worked in mercantile and agricultural fields. As the son of a rich landowner, he was probably gifted land in Halifax by his father. Allan rose quickly in public service jobs to higher positions. He served in Halifax as justice of the peace, Clerk of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, and Clerk of the Sessions, as well as representing the Cumberland Township in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1770‚Äì1776. In 1776 his seat was declared vacant because of non-attendance. His neglect of this position was likely due to the patriotic activities in which he had begun by this time to take part. After the Battle of Lexington and Concord and the Battle of Bunker Hill, Allan began to freely express his patriotic opinions, and, charged for treason to the Crown, he fled across the border to the town of Machias, Maine, in which anti-British sentiment was rampant. He arrived in Machias on August 11, 1776, where he met Jonathan Eddy and unsuccessfully attempted to stop him from attempting to take over the British-held Fort Beaus√©jour (Fort Cumberland), where Allan's wife and five children lived, with a disproportionately small army of Americans. Despite Allan's efforts, Eddy attempted the takeover of Fort Cumberland, which proved disastrous for the American cause and for any American supporters living in the area. = Travels to Boston and Philadelphia (1776‚Äì1777) = Before fleeing Halifax, Allan met with the Mi'kmaq and Maliseet (St. John's) Indian tribes in 1776 in order to secure their support. The British had previously approached them offering gifts and asking that they adopt a position of neutrality. Allan negotiated a treaty with these tribes that was ratified on August 29, 1776, stipulating an agreement that they would support the patriots in a war for independence. However, later that year in September, these same tribes argued that the people who signed the treaty had not been legitimate representatives, and that therefore the tribes would maintain a position of neutrality. In October 1776, Allan went to Boston and then to Philadelphia on a mission to secure aid for the Indian tribes in Northeastern Maine and Nova Scotia. In Philadelphia, Allan met with General George Washington. Although the particulars of their meeting are unknown, Washington's knowledge of and concern about Indian support and frontier settlements in Northeastern Maine suggests that Allan discussed these topics with him. However, Washington opposed expeditions into Nova Scotia because of the number of British soldiers there and the limited number of expeditions that the colonists could afford. Perhaps Washington's reluctance was a result of Eddy's ill-fated mission to seize Fort Cumberland, which resulted in a tightening of British forces there and the destruction of patriots‚Äô property, such as John Allan's. Allan's wife was also taken by the British to Halifax as a prisoner after Eddy's failed mission and she was interrogated for several months about her husband. Such happenings might have caused Washington to be reluctant about military action in Northeastern Maine and Nova Scotia, and to focus more on strategic relations with Indian tribes. After meeting with Washington in Philadelphia, Allan went to Baltimore, where he was received by the Continental Congress on January 1, 1777. Congress appointed him as the agent for Indian tribes in Nova Scotia and Northeastern Maine. The Continental Congress outlined his duties as \\"to engage [the Indians‚Äô] friendship and prevent their taking a part on the side of Great Britain\\". He was to do this through trade and propaganda. =The Battle of Machias (1777)= After leaving for Boston, where he would take headquarters as agent for Indian tribes, Allan primarily worked on acquiring and building up an army to secure Western Nova Scotia for the colonies. Patriotic sentiment throughout Nova Scotia made an attempt at seizure seem plausible. Allan asked Congress for three thousand men as well as supplies and schooners. Allan was so insistent on capturing Fort Cumberland because he recognized it as the base where many of Britain's supplies arrived. He also recognized that it would be difficult for Britain to expend effort on a war in Nova Scotia as well as the war in the thirteen colonies. Other motivations underlying Allan's mission included protecting the frontier and preserving relations with the Indians in Nova Scotia. The result of the attempt on Fort Cumberland was debatable: although Allan claimed that it was successful, he may have exaggerated the number of British soldiers killed and wounded. =Contributions as Superintendent of Eastern Indians= Colonel John Allan set out to negotiate with the St. John's Indian tribe on May 29, 1777. He used tactics such as stressing the Indians' importance to the American cause. Allan also employed economic tactics such as raising the price of furs so that the British would refuse to buy Indian furs and Indian sentiment toward the British would turn bitter. Allan faced significant danger during his negotiations with the Indians because the Indians were internally divided and the British were also actively attempting to gain their support. Both the British and British- supporting Indians made several attempts on Allan's life and all of these he escaped, although some were narrow escapes. Eventually, because of the backlash by British troops after Eddy's failed attempt on Fort Cumberland, Allan led Indians who were loyal to America to Machias, Maine in order to protect them. During the Battle of Machias in August 1777, the Indian tribes that Allan had recruited proved indispensable, despite the little amount of supplies that Congress had afforded them. In a few surviving correspondences by Allan, he pleads Congress for more supplies. After this battle until the end of the war, Washington determined that there would be no more military expeditions in Nova Scotia. However, Colonel Allan still had a lot of work to do as superintendent of Indians. Congress gave to him the additional responsibility of commanding troops of about three hundred men at Machias, which was still vulnerable to British attack. During his time in Machias, Allan had to face the challenges of shifting Indian alliances, limited aid from Congress, and resistance against his trade restrictions. Allan unsuccessfully asked to be relieved from duty, as he felt that he could not maintain good relationships with the Indians without better aid from Congress. He felt that he could do more good and have greater influence on the Indians who resided a short distance away from Machias. Congress denied his request by reappointing him as Superintendent of Eastern Indians, probably because they could find no other man better suited for the job. Despite his concerns, Allan did manage to keep most of the Indian tribes in Machias from lending their support to the British. Congress eventually allowed Allan to leave his position as Superintendent of Eastern Indians after the war's end. This was because his services were no longer crucial: the war had been won. The Eastern Indian Department, in which he worked, was dissolved anyway in 1785. After Allan vacated his position, the Indian tribes with whom he had previously worked pled with him to help relieve them from the deplorable post-war conditions they were facing. However, Allan could not do much to help them as he was no longer superintendent. He did, however, work to prevent post-war alliances between the British in Canada and Indian tribes. Overall, John Allan received compliments from Congress for his work as Superintendent of Eastern Indians. He was consistently promoted and praised in the Eastern Indian Department. Most government officials believed that Allan was indispensable to the cause and possessed unique skill in negotiating with the Indian tribes. Maine -- New Brunswick Boundary Dispute =Role in Boundary Negotiations of Eastern Maine= Following the end of the war, Allan stayed active in the patriotic cause even though he no longer officially worked as Superintendent of Eastern Indians. He noticed that there were encroachments by settlers from Nova Scotia into what he believed was United States territory. He wrote to the Continental Congress and the Massachusetts Council about how the border between New Brunswick (which used to be considered part of Nova Scotia) and the United States ought to be different than the British stated. Allan's arguments were used in future boundary negotiations.  Postwar Years/ Legacy  After the end of the war, Allan began an unsuccessful mercantile business on Allan's Island, now called Treat Island, in Passamaquoddy Bay. Records show that Allan traded several times with Benedict Arnold. Because Congress was stripped of money after the war, Allan, like many other officers in the war, suffered poverty and did not receive timely compensation for his work in the war. He had to write to Congress in order to receive pay for his work. Allan died on February 7, 1805 in Lubec, Maine. He was buried on Treat Island and there can be found a cenotaph that was dedicated to him in 1860 and inscribed with the names of his descendants. Although Colonel John Allan is not a name that many recognize and his contributions to the war were not flashy and militaristic, this man had a profound impact on the outcome of the war. His skills at negotiation prevented the British from securing the support of northeastern Indian tribes, and his careful attention and devotion to the United States even outside of his job influenced the boundary of Maine that still stands today.

The center's endowment was donated by the Norwegian government at the behest of the Jewish community of Norway as part of the restitution made to Norwegian Jews for the confiscation of their property while Norway was occupied during World War II. The center was established under the auspices of the University of Oslo and has a twofold mission: # Educating the public on the Holocaust, especially as related to the Norwegian experience, i.e., disenfranchisement, persecution, arrests, confinement, confiscation, and deportation to death camps outside of Norway, especially Auschwitz. This extends to studies of antisemitism in and outside of Norway, in the past, present, and future. # Studying ethnic and religious minorities, especially in Norway. To this end, the center offers educational materials, programs, exhibitions, a museum, and library collections. Though it is an independent entity, it has established formal relationships with the University of Oslo, Yad Vashem, and the Jewish Museum in Trondheim.

It is one of the city's ancient parish churches and is a Grade I listed building. Worship Worship at St Mary Magdalen's is high church Anglo-Catholic. Mass is celebrated 15 times a week: twice daily on weekdays, and three times on Sundays. The main celebration is at 10:30 am on Sunday mornings. History A Saxon wooden church was built outside the Saxon walls of the city of Oxford, just beyond the North Gate. This church was burnt down in 1074, so Robert D'Oyly, the Norman Constable of Oxford, had single- aisle chapel built to replace it. In 1194 Saint Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln, had the church rebuilt. Work of that period survives in the east wall of the chancel wall and in the south aisle, and the altar dedicated to St Thomas Becket. By 1235 the church had an altar dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The chancel was rebuilt late in the 13th century. A century later the scholars of newly founded Balliol College had an oratory dedicated to St Catherine in the present north aisle. In 1320 the Carmelites founded a chapel in the south aisle, which survives as the present Lady Chapel. The west tower was built between 1511 and 1531. The south porch, with a room above it, was also added around this time. In 1841‚Äì42 the church was restored. The architects for the north or \\"Martyrs' Aisle\\" were George Gilbert Scott, then young and unknown, and his partner W. B. Moffatt. Scott and Moffatt also had the Norman arch to the chancel removed. The north aisle complemented Scott's Martyrs' Memorial just north of the church. It was the first Gothic Revival interior in Oxford. The architect for the restoration of the south aisle was Edward Blore. In 1874‚Äì75 the 13th-century chancel was altered by raising the floor before the altar and adding a screen, the windows of the west tower were opened into the church and the bells were re-hung. The architect for these works was William Wilkinson. The antiquary and biographer John Aubrey was buried in the churchyard. Bells Small baptismal font formerly in St Mary Magdalen's Church The west tower has a ring of 10 bells, all cast or re-cast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough. The tenor bell was re-cast in 1988. The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth bells were re-cast in 1990. The third and fourth bells were cast in 2000. There were eight bells in the ring until 2001, when John Taylor & Co cast and hung the present treble and second bell. The Oxford University Society of Change Ringers has rung the bells since the 1930s.

Wolffsohn was born in Tel Aviv, in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine and today is Israel. His parents were German Jews who fled in 1939. In 1954, the Wolffsohns moved to Germany, settling in West Berlin. In 1966, Wolffsohn began his studies at the Free University of Berlin and continued his studies at Tel Aviv University and Columbia University. He obtained a PhD in History in 1975. From 1967 to 1970, Wolffsohn served in the Israeli Defence Forces. From 1975 until 1980, Wolffsohn taught at the University of the Saarland. Since 1981, Wolffsohn has served as a professor at the Bundeswehr University Munich as a professor in Contemporary History. His major interests are Israeli history, international relations, and German Jewish history. Wolffsohn has argued in favor of German patriotism and has claimed that the crimes of National Socialism represent no reason why modern Germans cannot be proud of their country. In his book Eternal Guilt? (1993), he argued against the idea of Germans having to bear guilt for the Holocaust for all time. Wolffsohn has strongly supported Israel and has argued for greater Western understanding and support of the Jewish state in face of what Wolffsohn regards as fanatical Islamic extremism. Likewise, Wolffsohn has supported the War on Terror and the administration of George W. Bush. In May 2005, he was a leading critic of the chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, Franz M√ºntefering, who compared a group of American capitalists attempting to purchase a German company to a ‚Äúplague of locusts‚Äù. Wolffsohn noted that the capitalists in question were Jewish, and that the Nazis had often compared Jews to locusts, and labeled M√ºntefering an anti-Semite. Wolffsohn wrote that as a grandson of Holocaust survivors, he was grateful to the Americans for liberating his grandparents and that as a German Jew, he felt deep shame over increasing German anti-Americanism. More recently, Wolffsohn has been a leading critic of the novelist G√ºnter Grass over his disclosure about his membership in the Waffen-SS during World War II. Wolffsohn is a strong supporter of Chancellor Angela Merkel's refugee policy calling migrants \\"a gift from the heavens\\" in an August 2015 guest column for leading German language business newspaper Handelsblatt. In the same article, he called the native German population's fear of \\"peaceful immigrants in search of sanctuary or a better life\\", \\"hysterical, dumb and their expulsion immoral as well as detrimental to their own interests.\\" Michael Wolffsohn, \\"Neuank√∂mmlinge sind ein Geschenk des Himmels\\", handelsblatt.com, 19/08/2015  Comment about Greek Elections of 2015  On 16 February 2015 he upset Greek people by publishing his provocative opinion that Greeks behaved like idiots by electing Alexis Tsipras for prime minister on 25 January 2015 elections.Michael Wolffsohn, \\"Tsipras h√§lt sein Volk f√ºr doof\\", handelsblatt.com, 16/02/2015 Work *Meine Juden‚Äîeure Juden, Piper 1997 . *Die Deutschland Akte: Juden und Deutsche in Ost und West : Tatsachen und Legenden, Ed.

Yogasangari, the son of Sangaree's brother Ganeshasangaree, was an EPRLF Member of Parliament. Yogasangaree, EPRLF leader K. Pathmanabha and others were assassinated by the Tigers on 19 June 1990 in Kodambakkam, India. Sayanuja, the daughter of Sangaree's brother Parathasangaree, was killed on the Tavistock Square bus bombing on 7 July 2005 Political career Sangaree became interested in politics at an early age and in 1955 joined the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, the leading leftist party in Ceylon at that time. He was the LSSP's candidate for Kotahena South Ward at the 1959 Colombo Municipal Council election against the incumbent mayor V. A. Sugathadasa but failed to get elected. He was persuaded to stand as the LSSP candidate in Kilinochchi at the March 1960 parliamentary election even though he had no connection to the area. He lost. He stood again at the July 1960 and 1965 parliamentary elections but was again defeated on each occasion. The leftist parties of Ceylon, who had in the past argued for parity between the Sinhala and Tamil languages, abandoned their beliefs in the late 1960s. They allied themselves with the communal Sri Lanka Freedom Party, who had made Sinhala the sole official language of Ceylon, and opposed the reasonable use of Tamil proposed by the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact signed by the United National Party Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake. The leftist parties adopted the racist slogan \\"Dudleyge bade masala vadai\\" - translation \\"there is masala vadai in Dudley's belly\\" (masala vadai is a Tamil delicacy). Sangaree, like many other Tamil leftists, became disillusioned with the leftist parties. Sangaree left the LSSP in 1966. Sangaree was chairman of Karaichi Village Council between 1965 and 1968. He joined the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) in May 1966. Karaichi Village Council was promoted town council in 1968. Sangaree was elected to Kilinochchi Town Council in 1968 and became its first chairman. Sangaree became the president of the ACTC's Yout Front in 1970. He stood as the ACTC candidate in Kilinochchi at the 1970 parliamentary election. He won the election and entered Parliament. In 1972 the ACTC, Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi and others formed the Tamil United Front (later renamed Tamil United Liberation Front). Sangaree was the TULF's candidate for Kilinochchi at the 1977 parliamentary election which he won. Sangaree and all other TULF MPs boycotted Parliament from the middle of 1983 for a number of reasons: they were under pressure from Sri Lankan Tamil militants not to stay in Parliament beyond their normal six-year term; the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka required them to swear an oath unconditionally renouncing support for a separate state; and the Black July riots in which up to 3,000 Tamils were murdered by Sinhalese mobs. After three months of absence, Sangaree forfeited his seat in Parliament on 22 October 1983. His refusal to take the oath under the Sixth Amendment also barred him from practising as a lawyer. Sangaree and his family, like many families of leading Tamil politicians, fled to Madras (now Chennai), Tamil Nadu. After the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord in 1987 Sangaree returned to Sri Lanka. He was one of the TULF's candidates in Jaffna District at the 1989 parliamentary election but failed to get elected. He was elected senior vice president of the TULF in 1993. He was one of the TULF's candidates in Vanni District at the 1994 parliamentary election but again failed to get elected. Sangaree was one the TULF's candidates for Jaffna District at the 2000 parliamentary election. He was elected and re-entered Parliament. In 2001 the TULF, ACTC, Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front and Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization formed the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). Sangaree was one of the TNA's candidates in Jaffna District at the 2001 parliamentary election. He was re-elected. Sangaree was elected leader and president of the TULF in June 2002 following the death of M. Sivasithamparam. Soon after its formation the TNA began to make a more pro-Tamil Tiger stance, recognising the Tigers as the sole representative of the Sri Lankan Tamils. This caused a split within the TULF. Some members of the TULF, led by its president Sangaree, were opposed to the Tigers. A long legal battle ensued for control of the TULF. Sangaree refused to allow the TNA to use the TULF name during the 2004 parliamentary election. This caused the members of TULF who wished to remain with the TNA, led by R. Sampanthan, to resurrect the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi political party. The TNA contested the 2004 parliamentary election under the ITAK symbol. The legal battle over the control of TULF meant that the TULF and Sangaree had to contest the 2004 parliamentary election as an independent group. The group failed to win any seats. Sangaree eventually won full control of the TULF but most of its leading members had already left the party and it had lost most of its political support. Sangaree had been a vocal critic of the government sponsored paramilitary groups. Following the dismal showing of the rump TULF in elections, Sangaree abandoned his beliefs and joined forces with two paramilitary groups (People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam and Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (Padmanaba wing)) to form the Democratic Tamil National Alliance. This new alliance contested provincial and local elections but with little success though Sangaree was elected to Jaffna Municipal Council at the 2009 local elections. Sangaree did another volte-face in 2011, joining force with the TNA to contest the 2011 local elections. UNESCO award Sangaree was awarded the 2006 UNESCO-Madanjeet Singh Prize for the Promotion of Tolerance and Non-Violence. The UNESCO statement said \\"As an indefatigable advocate of democracy and peaceful conflict resolution, he has contributed to raising awareness of the Tamil cause in a spirit of dialogue, while seeking to promote non-violent solutions to Sri Lanka and opposing terrorism\\". Sangaree collected his $100,000 prize at a ceremony held at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, France, on 16 November 2006.

Spread trades are usually executed with options or futures contracts as the legs, but other securities are sometimes used. They are executed to yield an overall net position whose value, called the spread, depends on the difference between the prices of the legs. Common spreads are priced and traded as a unit on futures exchanges rather than as individual legs, thus ensuring simultaneous execution and eliminating the execution risk of one leg executing but the other failing. Spread trades are executed to attempt to profit from the widening or narrowing of the spread, rather than from movement in the prices of the legs directly. Spreads are either \\"bought\\" or \\"sold\\" depending on whether the trade will profit from the widening or narrowing of the spread. Margin The volatility of the spread is typically much lower than the volatility of the individual legs, since a change in the market fundamentals of a commodity will tend to affect both legs similarly. The margin requirement for a futures spread trade is therefore usually less than the sum of the margin requirements for the two individual futures contracts, and sometimes even less than the requirement for one contract. Types of spread trades =Intracommodity (Calendar) spreads= Calendar spreads are executed with legs differing only in delivery date. They price the market expectation of supply and demand at one point in time relative to another point.http://chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/understanding_derivatives/understanding_derivatives_chapter_1_derivatives_overview.pdf A common use of the calendar spread is to \\"roll over\\" an expiring position into the future. When a futures contract expires, its seller is nominally obliged to physically deliver some quantity of the underlying commodity to the purchaser. In practice, this is almost never done; it is far more convenient for both buyers and sellers to settle the trade financially rather than arrange for physical delivery. This is most commonly done by entering into an offsetting position in the market. For example, someone who has sold a futures contract can effectively cancel the position out by purchasing an identical futures contract, and vice versa. The contract expiry date is fixed at purchase. If a trader wishes to hold a position in the commodity beyond the expiration date, the contract can be \\"rolled over\\" via a spread trade, neutralizing the soon to expire position while simultaneously opening a new position that expires later. =Intercommodity spreads= Intercommodity spreads are formed from two distinct but related commodities, reflecting the economic relationship between them. Common examples are: * The crack spread between crude oil and one of its byproducts, reflecting the premium inherent in refining oil into gasoline, gas oil, or heating oil * The spark spread between natural gas and electricity, for gas-fired power stations * The crush spread between soybeans and one of its byproducts, reflecting the premium inherent in processing soybeans into soy meal and soy oil * Highly correlated instruments such as Brent Crude vs WTI Crude or London White Sugar vs New York Sugar. =Option spreads= Option spreads are formed with different option contracts on the same underlying stock or commodity. There are many different types of named option spreads, each pricing a different abstract aspect of the price of the underlying, leading to complex arbitrage attempts. =IRS (Interest rate swap) spreads= Not to be confused with Swap spreads, IRS Spread trades are formed with legs in different currencies but the same or similar maturities. Two notable examples, U.A.E. Dirham and Saudi Riyal interest rate swaps, are quoted in the inter-bank market as spreads to US dollar interest rate swaps. AED and SAR currency exchange rates are each pegged to the USD, hence their interest rate swap markets are highly correlated to the US interest rate swap market respectively. e.g. if the SAR IRS Spread for a 5-year maturity is quoted as +150 basis points and the USD 5 year IRS fixed rate is trading at 1.00%, where the IRS fixed payments are annual and the floating payments are quarterly LIBOR, then the SAR 5 year IRS fixed rate will be 2.50%.

Geography Hubbards is located on the eastern side of the Aspotogan Peninsula, and along the northern shore of St. Margarets Bay. It borders the communities of Simms Settlement and Queensland. Hubbards sits astride the county line bordering Halifax County and Lunenburg County and is located in the Halifax Regional Municipality and Chester Municipal District respectively. Hubbards is located approximately 50 kilometres west of Downtown Halifax and 50 kilometres east of Bridgewater on Highway 103. History Hubbards was first settled by French-speaking Protestants, brothers John (1757‚Äì1835) and Frederick Dauphinee. As with all those who first settled the east side of the Aspotogan Peninsula, the brothers arrived from across St. Margaret's Bay at French Village, Nova Scotia. Their father emigrated from Montb√©liard, France to Halifax and then to Lunenburg. Captain John Dauphinee settled on what became known as Dauphinee's Point. In 1820, John Dauphinee began a lumber mill on Mill Lake. The origin of the name Hubbard's is likely a corruption of the name Hibbard, Hubert or Hibbert.An Etymological Dictionary of Family and Christian Names With an Essay on their Derivation and Import; Arthur, William, M.A.; New York, NY: Sheldon, Blake, Bleeker & CO., 1857.

The Fitzroy River which runs through Hubbards may have been named after British Prime Minister Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton (1735‚Äì1811). In the earlier part of the 20th century, Hubbards was a successful fishing community. During the Cold War, the Canadian Forces established a naval radio station at Mill Cove in 1967.

The expression Orthodox, is for the Dutch situation at least, of a later date than the existence of the congregations that make up the NIK and the NIK itself. The Rabbi of the NIK is Rabbi Dr. Raphael Evers. In total, the NIK has some 20 rabbis actively working in 18 congregations throughout the country, serving some 5,000 Jews. History =19th century= The NIK was founded in 1814 under the reign of Willem I, although the first steps towards a central organisation of Jewish communities in the Netherlands (which was the initial purpose of the NIK) were already taken in 1808, under command of Napoleon. The NIK was to form an umbrella over the existing Jewish communities. The NIK and its member-congregations maintained the traditional view on Judaism as it had been ever since and kept on going along this line, till today. Both the Ashkenazi and Sephardic communities were included. The newly found umbrella organisation had a clear hierarchical design: the Jewish communities were governed on a local level by twelve so-called large \\"hoofdsynagogen\\" (lit.: head synagogues), which had the power over the medium-sized synagogues (communities), which themselves had power over the smallest synagogues (called \\"bijkerken\\", like small Jewish communities on the Dutch countryside). Of the twelve \\"hoofdsynagogen\\", two were located in Amsterdam (Ashkenazi and Sephardic), two in The Hague (Ashkenazi and Sephardic), and one each in Rotterdam, Amersfoort, Middelburg, Den Bosch, Nijmegen, Zwolle, Leeuwarden and Groningen (all Ashkenazi, at that time called \\"Hoogduits\\", lit. \\"High German\\"). Two years later, another two were included: one in Maastricht, and one in Brussels (at that time Belgium was part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands). This form of structuring the Jewish community in the Netherlands gave a lot of power to the (chief) rabbis, as they were given the power to govern the entire community. With the new constitution in 1848 however, things changed. In its first step to a fully secular state, the government decided towards a separation of Church and State. This banned rabbis from any administrative role whatsoever. 1871 saw new regulations for the organisation. The Sephardic communities left the NIK to form the Portugees-Isra√´litisch Kerkgenootschap, gaining full independence within the Jewish community again as they had had in the centuries preceding the NIK. The NIK became thus fully Ashkenazi. The NIK saw its height in 1877 when it administered over some 176 Jewish communities throughout the Netherlands. The following decades saw a steady decline, administrating 139 communities on the eve of World War II. =20th century= The Holocaust destroyed most of the congregations, as at least 105,000 on a total of 140,000 Dutch Jews were killed by the Nazis between 1940 and 1945. =21st century= The NIK has some 20 rabbis governing some 36 Jewish communities or some 5,000 Jews and giving chaplaincy in the armed forces and to Jewish inmates. This makes them the largest Jewish religious organisation in the Netherlands. The NIK follows the rules of Orthodox Judaism, meaning among other things a separation between men and women during religious services and only accepting members who are halakhically Jewish. Despite the fact that the NIK follows the rules of Orthodox Judaism, most members do not consider themselves to be Orthodox Jews; thus making the NIK an organisation with a traditional Jewish outlook. Main rabbi for the NIK is Rabbi Dr. Raphael Evers, who serves by large as the face of the organisation in the media, representing the Jewish voice and opinion. Along with the larger Jewish communities, the NIK is responsible for supervising whether the rules for kashrut are followed, as well as the mikvaot (ritual baths), the upkeep of some two-hundred Jewish cemeteries in the Netherlands (on a national total of two-hundred-and-fifty) and (Orthodox) conversions to Judaism by non-Jews. The NIK also functions as a Jewish book publisher for the rather small Dutch language, bringing a variety of books with Jewish content to the Dutch-reading public, a.o. translated Torah, prayerbooks, part of the Mishna, Kitsur Shulchan Aruch, manuals for Jewish daily life and a successful structured plan for Jewish education to children from 4 years old and on to over 13 years. Part of the NIK is the Nederlands Isra√´lietisch Seminarium, the Jewish seminary, a state-recognized educational institution, which educates for Jewish teacher and rabbi. Four times a year the NIK publishes Hakehillot, a magazine for the Jews in the Netherlands, whilst it maintains a weekly updated news site and e-letter too. Congregations =Current= Congregations are called Nederlands Isra√´lietische Gemeente (NIG) or Joodse Gemeente. They exist in the following places: * Almere. The NIG Almere was founded on 5 January 1997, making it the youngest NIK-Jewish community in the country. Rabbi for the community is rabbi Moshe Stiefel, who also has plans to start a community in Lelystad, the capital of Flevoland province. Because of its proximity to Amsterdam, with more than 15,000 Jews the center of Jewish life in the Netherlands, Jewish Almere is steadily growing. A Jewish cemetery for the community was inaugurated on January 2004. * Amersfoort. The Jewish community in Amersfoort is currently one of the biggest outside of Amsterdam. Jewish life in Amersfoort started in the 17th century when Sephardic Jews settled inside the city. At the beginning of the 18th century they were joined by Ashkenazi Jews. The community grew to some 400 members in 1930. A large number of them managed to go into hiding at the beginning of the Second World War. The community was re-established in 1945, and had some 230 members in the first two decades after the war, diminishing to some 130 at the end of the 20th century. Nevertheless, the community still thrives. Amersfoort is the residence of Rabbi Binyomin Jacobs, who serves as the main religious leader for the Jewish communities outside of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Leiden. Amersfoort is also home to the Sinai Center for Jewish Mental Health. * Amsterdam. * Breda. The Jewish community in Breda numbers some 60 members, spread over the western part of the province of North Brabant. Jewish life officially started in 1803, and grew fast, numbering 230 persons in 1840 and 284 in 1899. This eventually declined to 181 persons in 1930. Approximately one of three Breda Jews survived the Holocaust. Jewish life restarted again after the war, and now Breda still boosts a lifely community, which has its own library and magazine. * Bussum. At the beginning of the 20th century, Bussum saw the rise of a Jewish community. Religious services were first held in Bussum in 1911. The community grew strong in the years following, reaching 341 members in 1930. After that, the community grew even more due to the influx of dozens of German-Jewish refugees. Approximately half of the Jews in Bussum were killed in the Nazi concentration camps during the Second World War. After the war Jewish life was restored and managed to flourish, with more than 200 people part of the community up until the 1970s. This number diminished slightly to some 150 members at the eve of the 21st century, making it one of the bigger Jewish communities in the Netherlands outside of Amsterdam (home to 15,000 Jews). The synagogue in the city of Enschede, inaugurated by the Jewish community in 1928. * Enschede The 17th century saw the first arrival of Jews in Enschede. The community grew due to the existence of industry in and around the city, and there were more than 1,400 Jews living in the city in 1941. Although the community was hit hard during the war, 395 Jews were still left in or returned to the city in June 1945. The first few years saw a strong Jewish community of some 300 persons resurfacing in the city. However, due to migration, aging, assimilation, and secularization, the community dwindled to some 70 members in 2006. The NIG communities in Hengelo and Almelo merged with the NIG community in Enschede in June 2006 to form the NIG Twente, Twente being the region around Enschede. August 2007 saw the appointment of a new rabbi within the community, rabbi Eliahoe Aharon Philipson, after rabbi Dov I. Salzmann, the previous rabbi, being the first post-Holocaust rabbi, retired and returned to his hometown Rehovot in Israel. * Groningen * Haarlem. Since the end of the 20th century being led by the dynamic rabbi Shmuel Spiero and since then one of the faster-growing communities. * The Hague * Leeuwarden. Jewish life in Leeuwarden flourished in the second part of the 19th century when the community numbered some 1,200 persons. This declined to 750 in the 1930s. The Holocaust saw the destruction of the once vibrant community. In 1951 the community had some 139 members; nowadays some 50 people are part of the congregation. In 1980 new synagogue was inaugurated in the former rabbi's residence, after the pre-war synagogue proved to be too big for the declining community. At the beginning of the 21st century, the local community managed to hold a weekly course in Talmud. * Leiden. Having the oldest university in the Netherlands, Leiden has for a long time attracted a large number of students, including many Jews. In the 17th and 18th century, most of them were of Sefardic origin; later on, the community became predominantly Ashkenazi. The community saw its height in the middle of the 19th century, numbering more than 500 persons. In 1930 the community had declined to some 340 persons. The Holocaust severely affected Jewish life in Leiden but did not destroy it. In 1998, some 100 persons were part of the NIG Leiden.http://www.joodsleiden.nl/index.html Among them is a large number of (non-Dutch) students. Leiden is also the home of the Joods Studiecentrum (Jewish Center of Learning) established in 1983 to accommodate the growing interest in the Netherlands among Jews and non-Jews in learning more about Judaism. * Maastricht. The congregation in Maastricht is led by Rabbi Yaakov Y. Schapiro, an American, affiliated to the Chabad movement. The community was formed in the 1980s when several communities throughout the province of Limburg joined together to form one congregation in Maastricht.http://www.synagoguemaastricht.com/ Shabbath services are held on a weekly basis. Kosher food in Maastricht is available since the rabbi's arrival. * Middelburg. The NIG congregation in Middelburg is part of a congregation that compromises the entire province of Zeeland. It numbers some 40 active members, most of them concentrated around Middelburg and Vlissingen. The Holocaust saw the destruction of the old Jewish community of Middelburg, but eventually, after 50 years, a new synagogue was inaugurated in November 1994. On 30 June 2004, a Jewish marriage took place at the synagogue, the first one in Middelburg since the start of World War II in 1940. * Nijmegen. The Jewish community in Nijmegen was once the biggest and oldest Jewish community in the Netherlands, already in existence in the first part of the 14th century. The community was destroyed in 1349 after accusations that Jews had spread the Black Plague, but several Jews resettled in the town again already in 1386. This community lasted some 100 years. At the beginning of the 17th century, Jewish life was again established. The community grew to some 530 persons in 1940. In the five years following, however, the community was largely destroyed by the Nazis. This didn't prevent the survivors from restarting the community again after the war had ended. In 2000, the community returned to its original 17th-century synagogue and left the 19th-century building adjacent to what was once the synagogue. The Jewish community is growing since the move to the ancient synagogue, attracting new interested Jewish people. It holds services and all kinds of cultural, social and religious events. The synagogue in the city of Zwolle. * Rotterdam. The history of the Jewish community in Rotterdam starts at the beginning of the 17th century, with the arrival of several Sephardic traders settling in this port city. The community grows slowly. From 1650 onwards, several Ashkenazi Jews, fleeing persecution in Poland and Germany, also settle in Rotterdam. With the growth of the city, the Jewish community grows as well, numbering some 2,500 at the end of the 18th century, making it the second-largest Jewish community in the Netherlands after Amsterdam. Up until the 1930s, the community grew even further, numbering almost 11,000 at the beginning of the Second World War. The Holocaust put a stop to the flourishing Jewish life in the town; no more than 13% of the Rotterdam Jews survives. In the 1950s, a community numbering some 800 persons (no more than 7% of the pre-war number) revitalises Jewish life again. Besides the existing NIK congregation, another Jewish congregation is formed, this one not modern Orthodox but Liberal in form, aligned to the NVPJ. The NIK community is nowadays the second-largest NIK congregation in the Netherlands (Amsterdam is the largest), led by rabbi Jehoeda Vorst.http://home.versatel.nl/rabbi.vorst/ * Utrecht * Zutphen.http://www.nigdestedendriehoek.nl/sjoel-zutphen2.htm While there were already Jews living in Zutphen during the Middle Ages, strong growth of the Jewish community only started at the end of the 18th century. Many of them came from Germany. The community reached the number of 600 persons in 1875. In 1930, the community still numbered 532 persons. The Holocaust had a devastating effect on Jewish life, with only some 60 Jews surviving the war. This didn't prevent Jewish life from resurfacing again. In 2000, the community merged with the Jewish communities of Apeldoorn and Deventer to form the De Stedendriehoekhttp://www.nigdestedendriehoek.nl/index.htm NIG Services are held at the synagogue of Zutphen, while some are also occasionally held at the synagogue of Apeldoorn. * Zwolle. Numbering some 600 in the 1930s, and 800 in 1940 (among them 121 foreign Jews), the Jews of Zwolle suffered tremendously during the Holocaust, with only 240 of them managing to survive by going into hiding or coming back alive from the Nazi concentration camps. Jewish life picked up again after the war had ended, and there is currently a small but active community, making extensive use of the city's synagogue. =Communities that closed or merged any time after WWII= * Aalten. The once lively Jewish community of the small town of Aalten numbered more than 100 Jews around 1840. In the following decades, the number of Jews declined to some 70 at the eve of World War II. Around half of the Jewish community perished during the Holocaust. After the war, some 46 Jews returned to the small town, but eventually, many emigrated, either to the larger Jewish communities still functioning in the Netherlands (like Amsterdam), or to countries like the United States of America and Israel. * Alkmaar. The Jewish community in Alkmaar numbers some 70 people, down from some 200 in the 1930s. It celebrated its 400th-year anniversary on 9 May 2004. * Eindhoven * Den Bosch. The 13th and 14th centuries saw the first accounts of Jews settling in Den Bosch. The community grew after the emancipation degrees which equalized the position of Jews within Dutch society. There were some 500 Jews living in Den Bosch at the beginning of the Second World War; 200 of them managed to survive. Jewish life continued after the war, but weekly services stopped in the 1970s due to the declining number of community members. For a while, services on the High Holy Days were still held. * Deventer. See for more information the section on Zutphen (see below). * Doetinchem. The first Jews settled in Doetinchem during the 17th century. The community reached a high around 1900 when some 260 Jews were living in this Gelderland town. There were some 160 Jews living in Doetinchem in the 1930s. A few dozen Doetinchem Jews managed to survive the Second World War by going into hiding; the rest was murdered in the Nazi concentration camps. After the war several Jewish communities were merged with the one in Doetinchem to become the NIG De Achterhoek,http://www.nigdeachterhoek.nl/ the Achterhoek being the name for the region where Doetinchem is part of. From right after the Holocaust there is no synagogue in Doetinchem anymore. * Dordrecht. Merged into Rotterdam. * Hilversum. Jewish life in Hilversum dates back to the beginning of the 18th century. There soon existed a flourishing community, which would number some 1,000 members in the 1930s. This increased to some 1,400 during the first year of the Second World War, when German-Jewish refugees in the Netherlands were forcibly resettled in Hilversum as well as other towns and cities throughout the country. Hilversum was hit hard by the Holocaust: no more than 10% of its Jewish inhabitants survived the war. Despite that, Jewish life in Hilversum flourished in the 1950s and 1960s, with some 200 Jews attending synagogue and participating in the Hilversum kehillah. After that numbers dwindled. In 1990 the Rabbinate for the rural communities (IPOR) settled in Hilversum. The Hilversum community merged into the one in Bussum. * Emmen. The synagogue in Emmen functioned as the place of worship for the NIG Drenthe, the kehilla for Drenthe province. Emmen had some 180 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, of which several dozen managed to survive. The Jewish communities of Assen, Emmen and Hoogeveen merged in 1988 to form the NIG Drenthe. * Oss. The Jewish community in Oss experienced its height in the 1930s when the community consisted of almost 300 people. The Holocaust, however, had a devastating effect, with most of the Jewish community being deported to the Nazi concentration camps in 1942. Nowadays, the number of Jews in Oss is estimated at some 30 persons. Founders of some of today's well-known companies belonged to the Jewish community in Oss; like Unilever, Bergos, AKZO, Organon.* Tilburg. Merged into Breda. * Winterswijk. Although the Jewish community in Winterswijk suffered severely during the Second World War, community life was re-established in 1951 with the re-inauguration of the synagogue present in this small town in the eastern part of the Netherlands. At that time, the community numbered no more than 30 people. In the years following, however, the community stayed relatively stable, numbering approximately 22 members in 1998. Services are held only on an incidental basis though. * Zaandam Gallery Sjoel denhaag.jpgNIG Synagogue in The Hague References External links * * Jewish Historical Museum Amsterdam Category:Jewish community organizations Category:Jewish Dutch history Category:Judaism in the Netherlands Category:Orthodox Judaism in Europe Category:Jewish organisations based in the Netherlands ","title":"Nederlands Isra√´litisch Kerkgenootschap"},{"id":"6601501","text":"The Aland is a river in the German states of Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, left tributary of the Elbe.

From 1926‚Äì1936 he was a visiting professor of psychology at Princeton University. Biography Holt was born in Winchester, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard in 1896 and received his Ph.D., also from Harvard, in 1901. His mentors at Harvard were William James, Hugo M√ºnsterberg, and Josiah Royce. Holt retired from teaching at Harvard in 1918. Kuklick (1977) has suggested that Holt's retirement from Harvard was due to various causes. First, Holt shared William James' concerns and criticisms of academia, and resented the fact that academic life had by his time turned into a quest for personal glory and prestige, rather than an honest quest for knowledge. Second, members of his intellectual group of friends, which included Robert Yerkes, Herbert Langfeld, and Ralph Barton Perry, left Cambridge or withdrew for familial reasons. Heft (2001) has also suggested that Holt's homosexuality might have generated some further conflicts in Cambridge in the early decades of the 20th century. Finally, Kuklick argued that Holt had assumed the care of his aging mother, which decreased his social interactions, and was likely the reason why Holt turned down an academic offer from the University of Manchester. Holt quit Harvard immediately after her death. His doctoral dissertation was in the area of perception, under the direction of M√ºnsterberg. Around 1910 he started with others the philosophical movement of new realism, as a response to Royce's criticisms of William James' views on realism. After attending Sigmund Freud's famous lecture in Clark University in 1909, Holt was highly impressed with psychoanalysis, which influenced his book The Freudian Wish. His most famous work was published in 1931, Animal Drive and the Learning Process: An Essay Toward Radical Empiricism, which presented his views on learning and development. Holt's psychology was related to the behaviorism of Watson, but his views about behavior were broader and more philosophically oriented than Watson's, including for instance notions such as goals, purposes, and plans, clearly observable in the actions of organisms (See discussions in Charles, 2011). For Holt, then, behavior is purposive and goal directed, a notion that influenced directly the theorizing of one of Holt's most famous students, Edward C. Tolman, who later emphasized many of Holt's points through his own work on purposive behavior. After his retirement, Holt moved to Tenants Harbor, Maine, with his long-time male companion, George X. Bernier. Holt came out of retirement and taught at Princeton for a decade between 1926 and 1936, before returning to Maine. Holt died in Rockland, Maine, in 1946, and is buried in Winchester, Massachusetts. Bibliography *\\"The Place of Illusory Experience in a Realistic World.\\" in The New Realism.

The station is owned by Cumulus Media, which acquired the station from Susquehanna Radio Corporation. Its studios are located in North Cincinnati and the transmitter site is just west of downtown. History The station began in 1959 as WAEF, a \\"beautiful music\\" station at 104.3 FM. The station moved to 98.5 in 1964 and increased its power. The station became WLQA in the early 1970s still with \\"beautiful music\\". The current call letters were adapted when the station transitioned to the current format. The station has used the identifier \\"Warm 98\\" since first adopting the adult contemporary format in late 1980. Immediately prior to that, it was playing \\"beautiful music\\" under its previous WLQA callsign. To ease the transition to Warm 98, the station said it would play the same songs as it did before, only now they would be performed by the original artists instead of by \\"beautiful music\\" performers. While the \\"soft rock\\" format of stations such as \\"Warm 98\\" is now very common, it can be said that \\"Warm 98\\" was not just one of the first \\"soft rock\\" stations in the country, but among the few stations of the genre that has kept this format under the same callsign and identifier for the longest period of time. Its timing worked well out well, as \\"Warm 98\\" quickly became popular with women and Baby Boomers at the time when many of them didn't care for trends in popular music in the late 1970s and early 1980s, instead preferring a lighter sound and yearning for the mainstream top 40 hits of the early 1970s. Thus, \\"Warm 98\\"'s playlist featuring artists such as The Carpenters, John Denver, Bette Midler, Steely Dan, Fleetwood Mac, and Dan Fogelberg had proven to be a real ratings winner. In recent years, Warm 98 has dropped the soft 70s songs of The Carpenters and John Denver from its playlist, and is more contemporary adhering to the more current and upbeat Adult Contemporary chart, playing songs from popular artists such as Maroon 5, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, and Ed Sheeran, as well as songs from the 80s and 90s such as Billy Joel, Journey, Elton John, Sheryl Crow, and Rod Stewart. The station's former frequency of 104.3 on the FM dial is now home to WNLT, a K-Love Contemporary Christian outlet. Programming For ten years, ending in February 2010, Warm 98 aired five hours of Smooth Jazz on Saturday nights hosted by midday personality Chris Lynn. The last time a Cincinnati FM station ran the Smooth Jazz format on a full-time basis was WVAE (\\"94.9 The Wave\\"), which ran from 1995 to 1999; however, the format had returned to the AM dial (albeit satellite-fed) on 1480 WCIN, but the station dropped it in May 2009, leaving the Cincinnati radio market without a smooth jazz outlet. Sunday mornings featured the long-running \\"Sunday Morning Music Hall\\" hosted by Cincinnati Ballet Music Director Carmon DeLeone. The show first aired on Easter Sunday in 1991 and ended its 16¬Ω year run on Sunday, January 6, 2008.

House of Bengal) is the official residence and principal workplace of the President of Bangladesh, located on Bangabhaban Road, and short road connecting Dilkusha Avenue, Dhaka. It is surrounded by the Bangabhaban Gardens (formerly Nawab's Dilkusha Gardens). The site hosted the Dilkusha Government House during British rule which was used by the Viceroy of India and the Governor of Bengal. The house was the official Governor's Residence of East Pakistan after the creation of Pakistan. President Abu Sayeed Chowdhury became the first Bangladeshi president to reside there after taking oath on 12 January 1971. The President Guard Regiment unit is responsible for the palace's security. History Manuk House in 1904, later became Governor's House in Bengal and present Bangabhaban During the period of the sultanate of Bengal, a Sufi saint, Hazrat Shahjalal Dakhini of Dhaka, and his followers were killed by agents of the sultan and buried on the site of Bangabhaban. The site soon became famous as a mazhar (mausoleum) for the devotees of the saint. It is conjectured that it belonged to a zamindar during the period of British rule. Nawab Khwaja Abdul Ghani of Dhaka bought the site and built a bungalow there, which he named as Dilkusha Garden. With the partition of Bengal in 1905 by Lord Curzon, the government of East Bengal and Assam bought the site and constructed a palatial house which served as a temporary residence for the Viceroy of India until 1911. From 1911 to 1947, the palace was called the Governor's House, and served as the official residence of the Governor of Bengal. Following the independence of India in 1947 & after creation of Pakistan ,East Bengal officially became part of Pakistan and became known as East Pakistan, the palace became the residence of the Governor of East Pakistan. The building was damaged by a storm in 1961; substantial reconstruction was completed by 1964. Two research books on history of Bangabhaban were published on 14 February 2006 under the initiatives of President Professor Dr. Iajuddin Ahmed. The two separate books were namely Hundred Years of Bangabhaban and Bangabhbaner Shatabarsha,.http://www.bangla-sydney.com/pdf/helal-100-years-of- bangabhaban.pdf The research panel was led by Vice-Chancellor of Bangladesh National University (Bangladesh Jatiyo Bishshobiddyaloy) Professor Dr. A. Momen Chowdhury who was also a senior Professor of the University of Dhaka and historian Dr. K. M. Mohsin, researcher-journalist-editor turned government actor Mukhles Chowdhury, historian with archive expertism Professor Dr. Sharif Uddin Ahmed and other distinguished researchers were involved. Notable, the book is the outcome of two years' research by a panel of eminent historians, researchers, scientists and architects. On 14 February 1906, Sir Joseph Bamfylde Fuller, the first Lieutenant-Governor of the then province of East Bengal and Assam started his official work at the Darbar Hall of the Bangabhaban during the British Rule. Status Main gate illuminated by decorative lighting during festive time One of the most important symbols of the Bangladesh government, the Bangabhaban holds a status akin to the official residence and office of heads of states around the world. The palace is an important historical landmark and the centre of media and tourist attraction. Special public ceremonies are held during Independence Day of Bangladesh on 26 March every year. The Bangladesh president frequently holds meetings, conferences and state dinners for sll occasions representing Bangladesh, including national leaders, intellectuals and visiting foreign heads of states and ambassadors. The traditions and pomp of the palace are a symbolic indication of the presidency's ceremonial superiority to other public and national institutions. Structure Main entrance facade The Bangabhaban is a mix of Moghul architecture with touches of British era designs that typify numerous buildings of the British-era (1857‚Äì1947) in Dhaka. With the reconstruction between 1961 and 1964, many elements of Islamic architecture and Bangla styles were incorporated. The palace has high boundary walls on all four sides. The main building is a three-storeyed palatial complex, around which stands extensive greenery and tree cover. The floorspace of the ground floor is 7000 square metres. The president's residence is on the north-east corner, comprising two storeys of two suites along with five well-furnished spacious bedrooms. The president's office, the office of the civil and military secretaries and other presidential officials, and separate rooms for audience with local and foreign visitors are also located in the ground floor. In addition, there is a cabinet room, banquet hall, darbar hall (court), state dining hall, a small auditorium and a lounge for local visitors. In addition to the president's residence, there are five rooms for officials, a control room and a studio in the first floor. In the second floor, there are four suites for foreign heads of state and government. The Bangabhaban has an open compound of of land. The security office, post office, bank, cafeteria hall, tailoring shop, a three-domed mosque and barracks of the president's guard regiment are located in the vicinity of the main gate of the Bangabhaban.

Ford Grey, 1st Earl of Tankerville (20 July 1655 ‚Äì 24 June 1701), 1st Viscount Glendale, and 3rd Baron Grey of Werke, was an English nobleman and statesman. Life Grey was the eldest son of Ralph Grey, 2nd Baron Grey of Werke and Catherine Ford, daughter of Sir Edward Ford of Harting in West Sussex. He was baptised the day of his birth at Harting. His family seat was Chillingham Castle in Northumberland, which he inherited on his father's death in 1675. In 1682 Grey achieved notoriety for being found guilty of seducing his wife's sister, Lady Henrietta Berkeley for which he was arrested, tried and ultimately freed. In 1683 he was arrested for involvement in the Rye House Plot but escaped from the Tower of London in July and fled with Lady Henrietta and her new husband to France. He later became one of the leaders of the Monmouth Rebellion, landing with Monmouth at Lyme Regis in June 1685. He was in command of the cavalry, and its defeat on two occasions may have been caused by his cowardice, possibly even by his treachery. He was taken prisoner and condemned for high treason, but he obtained a pardon by freely giving evidence against his former associates, and was restored to his honours in June 1686. During the reign of William III he was made Privy Councillor on 11 May 1695 and, on 11 June 1695, created Viscount Glendale and Earl of Tankerville. From 1695 till his death he was a Commissioner of Greenwich Hospital; from November 1699 till November 1700, First Lord of the Treasury.

Most of his own music can be described as progressive-experimental and sometimes psychedelic. Musical career Blake is most noted, in addition to his solo work, for his work with Lemon Kittens, Danielle Dax, Shock Headed Peters, Sol Invictus, Current 93, Left Hand Right Hand, Seven Pines and Ga√´ Bolg and the Church of Fand. Other past projects include Alternative TV, The Underneath, Evil Twin, British Racing Green and various other solo and session work. He began playing and self-recording in 1973/4, and his first band to have a commercially released record, Lemon Kittens,Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 230-231 was formed by Blake and Gary Thatcher on 5 April 1978. It went through numerous line-up changes before it again became a two-piece group consisting of Blake and Danielle Dax, with the addition of others for live performance (the group only played around 22 concerts during their entire existence). Between 1979 and 1981, Lemon Kittens released two albums as well as two EPs, described by Simon Reynolds as \\"aggressively absurdist records\\".Reynolds, Simon (2005) Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984, Faber & Faber, , p. 209 Cassette-only Lemon Kittens recordings were made under the name Gland Shrouds in 1980. Blake also released solo cassettes, including Tank Death and The New Pollution. In 1982 he formed Shock Headed Peters with Ashley Wales, eventually adding Dave Knight, then Mark Rowlatt and Clive Glover . In 1986 he started The Underneath, a solo project, releasing an EP and an album featuring various guests. Shock Headed Peters disbanded in October 1987 before reforming in 1990, again with founder-members Blake and Knight. In 1987, weeks after Shock Headed Peters' first disbanding, Evil Twin and British Racing Green were formed. Evil Twin was Karl Blake and David Mellor, with the addition of guest vocalist Amy Rodenberg. They recorded one album, The Black Spot, between 1987 and 1991. Both groups are dormant since the early 1990s. Blake toured extensively and recorded with Left Hand Right Hand from 1988 through until 2004. In 2005 Blake split ways with Sol Invictus, the group he had long been associated with through studio recordings and live appearances, and denounced both the group and the neofolk genre for, in his view, right wing leanings.\\"Karl Blake comments\\" on whomakesthenazis.com At present, Blake plays (live only) for Ga√´ Bolg and the Church of Fand and also for Seven Pines. The instrumental track Zo√© on the Seven Pines CD Le Cri (2006) was in fact written and performed by Blake on the spot and, unknown to him, orchestrated and released by the leader of Ga√´ Bolg, Eric Roger. It is one of the last recorded pieces by Blake to be released to date.

Background Bred by Peter Brant and owned by Michael Tabor, Thunder Gulch was a son of Gulch out of Line Of Thunder. Racing career Thunder Gulch won the Remsen Stakes as a two-year-old in 1994. In the spring of 1995, he won the Fountain of Youth Stakes and the Florida Derby. At Churchill Downs, he left the starting gate at 25-1 odds in 1995 and won the Kentucky Derby in 2:01.2 from post 16. He was ridden by jockey Gary Stevens. D. Wayne Lukas, his trainer, entered three horses for the 121st \\"Run for the Roses\\". Following his win in Louisville, Thunder Gulch finished third to his stablemate Timber Country in the Preakness Stakes. In the Belmont Stakes, Thunder Gulch was made 3/2 favourite after Timber Country was withdrawn from the race with a fever. He won by two lengths from Star Standard, giving Lukas the first individual Triple Crown, his fifth consecutive win in the series. Thunder Gulch also won in the Travers Stakes, in which he overcame a bad start to record a four and a half length victory over Pyramid Peak. With the Travers Stakes win, he became only the fourth horse to win the Kentucky Derby, Belmont Stakes, and Travers (Twenty Grand, Whirlaway and Shut Out were the others).Thunder Gulch Travers Victory Stirs Controversy Other victories in 1995 included the Swaps Stakes, and the Kentucky Cup Classic Handicap. Thunder Gulch was retired in the fall of his three-year-old campaign after finishing fifth to American Horse of the Year Cigar in a \\"much-anticipated showdown\\" for the Jockey Club Gold Cup. After the race, it was discovered that he had fractured his left front cannon bone. Stud record In 2012, the chestnut stallion was standing at Ashford Stud, the American branch of the giant Irish breeder Coolmore Stud, near Versailles, Kentucky, for a fee of $10,000 live foal. Among the many horses Thunder Gulch has sired are the graded stakes race winners Spain, Balance, Point Given, and Circular Quay. Point Given was 2001 3 year old Horse of the Year after winning the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes that year. Circular Quay was among trainer Todd Pletcher's many Kentucky Derby entries of 2007, but ran a disappointing sixth in that race and fifth in the Preakness. He also sired Alittlebitearly, whose December birth date made it impossible for her to be raced, but has had a successful breeding career, as she was dam to Bayern, a Breeders' Cup Classic winner. 4-time winning bay gelding Sir Mowgli XVII, is now a leading Hunter competing throughout the Southwest, having recently relocated to Durango Farms in Coto de Caza, CA. In 2015, Thunder Gulch was pensioned from stud duties at Ashford Stud and lived out the rest of his days at the farm. He was selected as the \\"babysitter of sorts\\" to be a neighboring pasture companion and calming influence to the newly retired Triple Crown champion, American Pharoah. Thunder Gulch was euthanized on March 19, 2018 due to the infirmities of old age at Coolmore America's Ashford Stud. Technically age 25, based upon standardized rules declaring all Thoroughbreds a year older each January 1, he was officially age 26.

History The valley was first inhabited by the Ojibwe and colonized by German and Scandinavian immigrants. The region also has a large Hmong community. While the term \\"Chippewa Valley\\" technically refers to the drainage basin of the Chippewa River and its tributaries, the name is more often applied to the Eau Claire- Chippewa Falls metropolitan area and the surrounding area--including communities not located within the Chippewa River's watershed. From the 1850s to the early 1910s, lumber baron Orrin Henry Ingram was largely responsible for the deforestation of the valley and the subsequent establishment of many small towns in the area.Guide to the Ingram Family and Empire Lumber Company Papers, 1906-1934 , University of Wisconsin‚ÄìEau Claire: McIntyre Library The population center of the Chippewa Valley is Eau Claire. Other communities include Menomonie, Chippewa Falls, Durand, and Altoona. The region's agricultural products include milk, cheese, horseradish, kidney beans, apples, pumpkins, beef, and poultry. Much of the regional economy is service-driven, although there is also a significant light-industrial segment, especially in high tech (mainly computers). Historic sites include the Cook-Rutledge Mansion in Chippewa Falls, the Caddie Woodlawn Museum south of Downsville, the Mabel Tainter Center for the Arts in Menomonie, and a number of exhibits in Eau Claire's Carson Park.

In contrast to performers, this broad category contains all \\"unseen\\" theatrical personnel who practice stagecraft and are responsible for the logistic and production- related aspects of a performance including designers, operators, and supervisors. Many professional designers and technicians consider the diminutive \\"techie\\" to be offensive. Typical positions Theatrical responsibilities taken by technicians include: * Set construction and theatrical carpentry * Sound system configuration and operation * Lighting design and light board operation, Followspot operation, hanging and maintenance of stage lighting instruments as well as various other electrical jobs * Flying of scenery and occasionally even actors by fly men * Rigging of moveable and stationary set pieces by riggers * Stage management * Costume and prop management * Operation of Special effects including fog machines and pyrotechnics A single theatrical technician may regularly do one or more of the above jobs during load in, load outs (strike), rehearsal and performance. Performance technicians are generally divided between those backstage (stagehands, Stage Managers) and those in a control room (lighting and audio technicians). During load in and load out additional crew members may be needed due to the amount of work required to be completed in a short time span. Larger and more complex shows require larger crews and often personnel with specialized advanced skills to perform these job functions. The position may be volunteer or a paid position. It is not uncommon to receive compensation (such as comp/free tickets to the current or future productions or items used in the show) in other forms than money for pay. This type of compensation allows the person working to receive value for their services while not costing the producer more out-of-pocket expenses. Theatrical technicians are represented by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees in the United States. Stagecraft classifications Stagecraft and technicians can be classified into departments and jobs as follows. Not all productions will have all departments or jobs filled, and, in many cases, one technician will perform multiple jobs (even if only possessing one title). * Technical Director ‚Äì This person will typically oversee the carpentry, rigging, lighting and props departments as a liaison to the performance's primary director. Depending on the production, a \\"TD\\" may also supervise the audio and pyrotechnics departments. In smaller performances and venues, this position is commonly taken by the show's director, assistant director, or stage manager. In addition, non-resident venues (those that host touring or temporary performances rather than long-term productions) generally have an in-house Technical Director who oversees incoming event load-in, and a technical liaison between the venue's owner/manager and the director of the performance. =Carpentry= This is the general name for all work involving scenery, including the deck (floor) of the stage. * Master Carpenter ‚Äì Although there may be multiple Master Carpenters in a scene shop, typically a performance or tour will only have one. This technician will typically report directly to the Technical Director. * Carpenter ‚Äì Multiple carpenters may be attached to a single show, and report to the Master Carpenter. These technicians are responsible both for assembling and building the scenery as well as moving scenic elements during scene shifts. Often these technicians also function as stagehands. =Electrics= This department is responsible for all of the onstage lighting for a show including, but not limited to, practicals, stage lighting and followspots. Electricians are responsible for the assembly, installation, operation and maintenance of the lighting for a production. The Electrics department is also typically in charge of any fog or haze machines used during a production, as well as the configuration of pyrotechnics and other special hardware. * Master Electrician ‚Äì The head of the Electrics department on a show, who typically reports directly to the Technical Director, but also sometimes to the Lighting Designer during the development phase of a show.  Head Followspot Operator ‚Äì In some shows, a separate technician gives all cues to the follow spot operators to reduce the stage manager's workload.  Light board operator ‚Äì The person who operates the light board and controls all the stage lights during a show. In smaller performances and venues, may be the Lighting Designer or the Master Electrician.  Electrician ‚Äì Multiple electricians may be assigned to a single show. On touring shows, this can be a general designation, with specific positions as follows: * Deck Electrician ‚Äì Responsible for all electric elements on the stage floor, including roving instruments, fog machines, practicals or lighting installed into scenic pieces. Also, in some shows (usually dance productions), where it is sometimes necessary to swap the color media on lighting instruments during the performance or re-focus lights that a performer may have bumped into, the Deck electrician may be responsible for these swaps. * Followspot Operators ‚Äì These technicians operate one or more followspots to track performers during a show. =Rigging= This department is responsible for all equipment hung (flown) in the theater space. This department varies greatly from show to show, sometimes being absorbed into the Electrics or Carpentry departments. If the production incorporates personnel flying (such as in the staging of Peter Pan), there will usually be designated riggers specifically trained in flying actors. Rigging techniques and traditions come from sailing. Sailors were considered the earliest stagehands in history and many techniques used today for rigging in the theater are from standard uses on boats. Theater technicians today have also incorporated techniques from mountain climbers as well to improve the capabilities of flying equipment in the air. * Rigger ‚Äì The general term for persons in this department. If a rigger is specifically assigned to a certain department, they will have a title referencing that department (Electrics Rigger). * Flyman ‚Äì Specific term normally used with counterweight rigging system for an operator of the linesets for those systems. * Head Flyman ‚Äì The senior technician in charge of the operations of a counterweight rigging system. =Rigging systems= A theater consists of four basic rigging systems such as: hemp house, single purchase, double purchase and truss. Proper knowledge of the basic rigging systems by theater technicians is how scenery is properly built and hung over people's heads for productions. The hemp house is where all the ropes are housed in the theater and are counterweighted with sandbags. Whereas a single purchase is where the loading floor is on the stage floor in order to reduce the amount of staged space in the wings. A double purchase system works quite differently compared to a single purchase because it puts the loading floor halfway between the stage floor and the loft blocks. The truss is considered as to be the most important rigging system in theater because it consists of two or more pieces of pipe fabricated together with cross bracing. The purpose of the truss is to replace standard pipes for extremely heavy loads to be lifted. Carver, Rita Kogler(2012). \\"Stagecraft Fundamentals Second Edition: A Guide and Reference for Theatrical Production\\", p. 256-262. Focal Press, MA. . =Properties= The properties department is responsible for all hand and scenic props for a show. This usually includes furniture, weaponry and consumables (paper, food and drink) for a production. In addition to the above duties, the props department is responsible for the cleanliness of the stage floor, including sweeping and mopping of the stage surface. * Propsmaster/Propsmistress ‚Äì The head of the Properties department. Will also usually be in charge of purchasing or building the props for a show. * Prop Runner ‚Äì Those who must move scenic props on (and off) stage or supply actors with their props during the show. This job is often unnecessary in small shows. * This position may also be referred to as a set dresser. =Audio= The audio department is responsible for all sound production for a show, including the configuration of microphones, speakers and control equipment, as well as the production of any necessary audio tracks. Personnel in this department include: *Sound designer or audio engineer, responsible for the configuration of the venue's sound system as a whole, including the placement and designation of microphones, monitors, loudspeakers, and control hardware. This position is often held by an acoustician, especially in large performances requiring musical or orchestral sound reinforcement. *Sound operator, responsible for the live mixing of the performance's audio at a master sound board. Often referred to as A-1 to designate the first (highest) position of the production Audio department. This technician is generally positioned in the back of the audience space, so as to hear the performance's audio directly rather than be forced to use a monitoring system, and is responsible for maintaining volume for performers and musicians while avoiding feedback and other problems. A-2, or audio assistant, responsible for the maintenance and monitoring of audio equipment used by the sound operator (specifically any lavalier microphones used in the performance). Depending on performance size, this technician may perform other duties, including the operation of audio media devices. In smaller performances, this position is often taken by a stagehand rather than a technician trained in audio. =Pyrotechnics/special effects= A rarely seen department in theatre due to the heavy restrictions on the use of true pyrotechnics and is sometimes combined with other tech departments (usually the Electrics department) is referred to as special effects. Theatrical technicians are responsible for the production and operation of explosives, special effects and illusions on sufficiently large theatrical productions. Today many of the special effects used on stage have been modernized and are extremely advanced the most commonly used effects are nature, fire, fog and haze. In order to make special effects seem more realistic on stage technicians use innovative techniques and special equipment to bring the production to life across the stage. For nature effects like wind, fans are commonly used to bring movement on stage by adjusting the speed and direction of the fan. For effects like fire, equipment is brought in to create flames and smoke and is usually operated by a licensed special effects operator. Whereas fog and haze machines are easy and accessible for technicians to use and only require fluid to be placed inside the machine to vaporize into fog and haze. These machines also have functions where the flow and speed of the fog and haze can be adjusted to control how its distributed throughout a production.Carver, Rita Kogler(2012). \\"Stagecraft Fundamentals Second Edition: A Guide and Reference for Theatrical Production\\", p. 256-262. Focal Press, MA. . =Stage management= The stage manager is in control of a production during its run. Responsibilities include calling the cues and determining the starting time of the show and ensuring the safety of all persons involved. Depending on circumstances, multiple positions are possible: * Production Manager ‚Äì Typically seen on touring shows or larger permanent venues, this is usually the most senior member of the stage management staff. * Stage Manager ‚Äì The usual title applied to the head stage manager assigned to a specific production. This will also be the person who will run a show during performances. * Deputy Stage Manager ‚Äì Also known as \\"Call Boy\\" is responsible for calling technical (lighting, sound, fly, av etc.) cues at certain times read from the prompt copy (Cue Script).  Assistant Stage Manager ‚Äì Reports to the Stage Manager, usually assisting backstage or onstage during a production. * Repertory Stage Manager ‚Äì Used occasionally if one stage manager oversees multiple productions being performed in repertory. During any one production, would fulfill the duties assigned to the Stage Manager as above. * Production Assistant ‚Äì Used in Equity houses (Actor's Equity Association is the union for Stage Managers), this is the non-union equivalent of an Assistant Stage Manager * Deck Stage Manager ‚Äì Used in some shows to specifically refer to the Assistant Stage Manager on the deck during a performance. =Wardrobe= Responsible for the creation and maintenance of costume pieces and dressing the performers. *Costume Designer *Assistant Costume Designer * Wardrobe Mistress/Master ‚Äì The head of the wardrobe department during a production * Dresser/Wardrobe Crew ‚Äì General Wardrobe technician during a show that assists the performers in dressing and performing quickchanges. * Draper * Tailor * Costumer ‚Äì Person responsible for the creation of all costumes for a show. Similar to a Technical Director for the Wardrobe, Hair and Makeup departments. * Milliner ‚Äì Seen occasionally, this person is responsible for the creation of headwear for a show. * Wardrobe Crafts ‚Äì Sometimes found as a separate department or a sub- department of Wardrobe, this department is responsible for the creation of masks, headdresses or non-standard costumes for a production. * Hair/Makeup ‚Äì Twin departments responsible for the makeup, wigs and hair stylings for a show.

Early life Eliot was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1798. He was the son of banker Samuel Eliot and Catherine Atkins Eliot, and was related to Thomas Hopkinson Eliot. He attended the Boston Latin School, and graduated from Harvard University in 1817 and from Harvard Divinity School in 1820. His father had wanted to see him become a minister, but he died the year of his graduation and Samuel stopped short of the pulpit. Instead he traveled Europe for two years, gaining great knowledge in music and singing, and developing interests in parks and playgrounds. Career His interest in music led him to become president of the Boston Academy of Music from 1834 to 1847. As an influential member of the Boston school committee, he was successful in placing music in the curriculum of all public schools. With his brother William he founded the Union Church in Nahant, Massachusetts, where he had earlier built a classical Greek revival summer home at 40 Steps Beach on Nahant Road. He served as the first president of the Boston Provident Association, one of the first organizations to aid the poor. He assisted developing the Prison Discipline Society, becoming its treasurer and president to reduce the miserable conditions found in the houses of correction. He was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1834 to 1837. From 1837 to 1839, he was Mayor of Boston. During his administration a riot took place, caused by a collision between a volunteer fire company and an Irish funeral procession. The disturbance was suppressed by the promptness of Mayor Eliot, who was on the ground at the first alarm, and immediately took measures for calling out the militia. The result of this affair was the establishment of a paid fire department and a day police. Eliot served in the Massachusetts Senate in 1843‚Äì1844. He was elected as a Whig to the 31st United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Robert C. Winthrop, and served from August 22, 1850 to March 3, 1851; he declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1850. He was treasurer of Harvard University from 1842 to 1853. He published a Sketch of the History of Harvard College and of its Present State (Boston, 1848), and edited selections from the sermons of Dr. Francis W. P. Greenwood, with a memoir (2 vols., Boston, 1844). He contributed writings to the North American Review and the Christian Examiner. Samuel Atkins Eliot Summer House, 40 Steps Beach Nahant MA, Circa 1830 Personal life On June 13, 1826 he married Mary Lyman the daughter of Theodore Lyman (1753-1839) born in York Maine, and his second wife Lydia Pickering Williams of Salem Massachusetts, the daughter of George Williams and the niece of Colonel Timothy Pickering. Lyman became prosperous in the East India trade and an influential merchant in Boston, building a country estate known as the \\"Vale\\" (Lyman Estate) in Waltham, Massachusetts, where his daughter Mary and Samuel would be married. The marriage produced four daughters and two sons, including Charles William Eliot, a future president of Harvard University. Between 1829 and 1830 he built a lavish house at 31 Beacon Street, now the western edge of the Massachusetts Statehouse lawn. He died in Cambridge, Massachusetts on January 29, 1862 and his body was interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery.

It was Simca's first original design (earlier models were all to a greater or lesser extent based on Fiats), as well as the company's first unibody car. \\"/ Aronde -hirondelle\\" means \\"swallow\\" in Old French and it was chosen as the name for the model because Simca's logo at that time was a stylized swallow. The three generations There were three generations of the model: the 9 Aronde, made from 1951 to 1955, the 90A Aronde, made from 1955 to 1958, and the Aronde P60, which debuted in 1958 and continued until the model was dropped in 1964. Some 1.4 million Arondes were made in total, and this model alone is largely responsible for Simca becoming the second-biggest French automaker at the end of the 1950s.  Simca 9 Aronde  The first Aronde debuted in the spring of 1951 but initially only a few hundred pre-production cars were distributed to carefully selected \\"guinea-pig\\" buyers, and the full production version was finalised only in time for the Paris Motor Show, becoming available for sale in October 1951. The full production version incorporated various detail changes when compared to the pre-volume production cars, including a changed material for the seat covers and a moulded plastic dash-board which at the time appeared very modern when compared to the metal dashboard on the Aronde's most obvious competitor, the Peugeot 203. A few months later, at the start of 1952, space was found to position the battery under the bonnet/hood: in the earliest cars the battery was stowed under the front seat. The Aronde was fitted with a front-mounted 1221 cc engine from the previous Simca model, the Simca 8, fuel feed being provided by a Solex 32 carburetor. Power was delivered to the rear wheels via a traditional four-speed manual gear box incorporating synchromesh on the top three ratios. The car had independent suspension at the front using coil springs, with a live axle at the rear, suspended using semi-elliptic leaf springs. Hydraulically operated drum brakes were used all round. The only body style offered at the October 1951 launch was a four-door saloon/sedan/berline, but other configurations very soon became available such as the three-door estate (branded initially as the \\"Aronde commerciale\\" and later as the \\"Ch√¢telaine\\") with a horizontally split tailgate. There was also a van, called the \\"Messag√®re\\", and a \\"commerciale semi-vitr√©e\\" - part panel van and part estate - became available in 1953. Of more interest to collectors is the two-door coup√© coachbuilt by Facel. The Facel-built coup√© was replaced for 1953 by a coup√© based on the saloon Aronde body, called Grand Large, featuring a large three piece wrap-around rear window and a \\"pillarless\\" side window effect when both side windows were wound down. A two-door cabriolet conversion, prepared by the coachbuilder Figoni, was presented to the public for the 1953 model year in a display involving ballerinas, but it proved impossible to confer sufficient structural rigidity on this car without unacceptable cost and weight penalties, and Figoni's Aronde cabriolet was never produced for sale. The 1952 Motor Show saw several manufacturers attempting to broaden the appeal of mainstream ranges with stripped down versions offered at a reduced price. The trend seems to have been started by Renault with their 4CV Service, and they were quickly followed by other automakers in including Rosengart and Simca. Simca's \\"Aronde Quotidienne\\"\\"Quotidienne\\" means (approximately) \\"daily\\" was offered from January 1953 with an advertised price of 630,000 francs, which was a saving of 45,000 against the previous base model (confusingly branded, even then, as the \\"Aronde Berline Luxe\\"). The interior of the Quotidienne was simplified and the heater disappeared, as did most of the exterior trim. Nevertheless, chrome headlight surrounds remained in place: importantly, too, buyers of the \\"Aronde Quotidienne\\" could still choose from the full range of body colours offered on the \\"Aronde Berline Luxe\\". The company was keen to stress that the stripped down Aronde was not as fully stripped down as the Renault Fr√©gate Affaires (available only in black), the Renault 4CV Service or the Rosengart Artisane (these last two being offered only in grey). The 9 Aronde was well received, especially in France. It took only until 17 March 1953 before total production of this model at the Nanterre plant passed 100,000.Bellu (2000), p. 73 The company's flamboyant boss. Henri Pigozzi, was keenly aware of the publicity that could be gleaned from the craze for record breaking runs. In May 1952 an Aronde broke five international records by covering a distance of at an average speed of 117 km/h (73 mph), and in August 1953 another Aronde, selected at random from the production line, returned to the Montlh√©ry circuit for a new record attempt whereby during the course of forty days and forty nights the car covered 39,242 laps which represented at an average speed of more than 104 km/h (65 mph). This achievement, which involved breaking more than 30 international records, was undertaken under the supervision of the ACF. A car tested in France by the British Motor magazine in 1951 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 30.2 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car was reported to cost 970 Francs on the French market. It was not at the time available in the UK but the price was converted to ¬£657.

The new Aronde was now powered by the ungraded and newly named 1290 cc Flash engine. The unit retained the cylinder stroke of the previous engine, but the cylinder bore was increased to . The Solex 32 carburetter was unchanged but a raised compression ratio provided for a small increase in claimed maximum power which, for the models as displayed at the motor show in October 1955, now given as at 4,500 rpm or at 4,800 rpm (and more in some low volume more highly tuned versions). Externally the Aronde for 1956 had an updated 9 Aronde body, with restyled front and rear ends. A very slight lengthening of the car at the back made it possible to position the spare wheel under the floor of the boot/trunk which allowed for a substantial increase in usable luggage capacity. New trim levels, marketed as Elys√©e and Montlh√©ry (named after the Autodrome de Montlh√©ry) appeared. The \\"Commerciale\\" and \\"Messag√®re\\" vans remained available, with a version of the 1.3 litre \\"Flash\\" engine. They received the 90K modelcode.

The wheelbase was unchanged and, apart from a slightly lowered roof-line, the central portion of the body was still broadly similar to that of the original 1951 Aronde, but the discrete tail-fins and rear lights were restyled as were the headlights, set on either side of a larger grill at the front. Mechanically little had changed: more innovative was the wide range of versions and permutations now offered, with customers able to choose from a range of engines offering four different levels of power output (40, 45, 47 or 57 hp) and an options list that even included leather upholstery and a \\"Simcamatic\\" clutch. = A proliferation of names = In line with the manufacturer's determination to offer customers more choice, the Simca Aronde P60 was offered with various names. The following cars all shared the same wheelbase and the same length/width footprint: :* Simca Aronde P60 √âlys√©e: 4-door berline (sedan/saloon) 1290 cc (7CV) :* Simca Aronde P60 Grand Large: \\"Coach panoramique\\" (2-door hardtop) 1290 cc (7CV) :* Simca Aronde P60 Montlh√©ry: 4-door berline (sedan/saloon) 1290 cc (7CV, higher compression) :* Simca Aronde P60 Monaco: \\"Coach panoramique\\" (2-door hardtop) 1290 cc (7CV, higher compression) :* Simca Aronde P60 Ch√¢telaine: 3-door estate/station wagon 1958 Simca Aronde Sales Brochure French wb3358-86Z9Z2, www.ebay.com.au, as archived at web.archive.org 1290 cc (7CV) Although the engines were unchanged, direct comparisons between the Aronde P60 √âlys√©e and the previous model disclosed a small deterioration in overall top-end performance which was attributed to various \\"improvements\\" to the car's overall profile which, taken together, reduced the body's aerodynamic efficiency. The Aronde Ch√¢telaine (estate) at this stage retained the body of the earlier Aronde 90A Ch√¢telaine, but by 1960 a more luxurious estate version, branded as the Simca Aronde P60 Ranch, combined the new front end (resembling, according to one source, the 1957 Ford Thunderbird) from the new Aronde P60 with the back end of the previous generation of Aronde estates. = Broadening the range = The announcement of the Aronde P60 coincided with a resurrection for the old 1090 cc (6CV) engine last seen in the Simca 8 before that model received a larger engine in 1949. The old 6CV unit was now fitted in a reduced specification Simca Aronde, but the bodies of these downmarket Arondes still, at this stage, were those of the 90A Aronde of 1955-58, and not from the new Aronde P60. The cylinder stroke of the two engines was the same, but the bore diameter on the 1090cc unit was smaller and in return for a rather anaemic level of performance, buyers enjoyed a small improvement in fuel consumption. The car, known as the Aronde Deluxe Six, was aggressively priced at 598,000 Francs which enabled it to compete with the popular Renault Dauphine for which listed prices started at 594,500 Francs. The \\"old\\" Aronde body was also available with the 1290 cc (7CV) unit fitted in the new Aronde P60s, and in this form the car was known as the Aronde Super Deluxe. A year later the entry level Arondes acquired the P60 body that the other models had received in 1958, and the 1960 cars exhibited at the Paris Motor Show in October 1959 combined the newer bodies with the engines and the reduced specifications of the previous year's entry level models. The price had crept up too, with the entry level Aronde Deluxe Six now listed at 6,050 New Francs for a basic saloon, while the basic Renault Dauphine was still listed at less than 6,000 New Francs. The changes for the 1960 model year also involved more names, and the three low end Aronde models were now named as follows: :* Simca Aronde P60 Deluxe six: 4-door berline (sedan/saloon) 1090 cc (6CV) :* Simca Aronde P60 √âtoile six: 4-door berline (sedan/saloon) 1090 cc (6CV) (featuring more sophisticated rear suspension) :* Simca Aronde P60 √âtoile sept: 4-door berline (sedan/saloon) 1290 cc (7CV) After this the old Aronde body was restricted to a single model, the Simca Deluxe sept also known as the \\"Aronde Outremer\\" since it was intended for sale overseas, chiefly in Algeria, at that time blighted by an increasingly bitter war for independence. = Engines = A new engine, the Rush 1290 cc unit, with the same cylinder dimensions as before, but now incorporating a five-bearing crankshaft, was fitted to the Arondes beginning from October 1960. A wide range of power outputs for the new engine was offered according to model, ranging initially from to . During this period higher octane fuels were becoming the norm at filling stations across France, and some of the changed power outputs correlated with changed compression ratios. The situation is further complicated by changes to the basis for computing power output in France (and elsewhere in Europe) at the end of the 1950s.Changes in the way that power output was computed by European automakers did not take place overnight, and accordingly information from automakers provided during the late 1950s and 1960s, as well as sources derived from then, usually do not spell out the computation basis used when quoting Horsepower (hp) data. Practice in France (and Britain) had since 1945 tended to follow North American practice, measuring \\"SAE\\" gross power whereby prior to measurement the engine was stripped of \\"auxiliary elements\\" such as filters, silencers/mufflers, pumps, dynamo/alternator and transmission. By removing most of the elements that absorbed engine power before it ever came near to the drive shaft, it was possible to maximise the horse-power figure. At the end of the 1950s French and British automakers moved towards the (originally German) DIN standard which measured the power arriving at the drive shaft without removing the \\"auxiliary elements\\". In practice there was far more variation in how horse power was measured than this necessarily simplistic summary allows and there is no universal formula for converting an SAE horsepower figure to a DIN horsepower figure, but a reduction in the power figure quoted of perhaps 15% when switching to a DIN figure in most cases provides a reasonable approximation. A version of the engine, called Rush Super M, debuted in September 1961 in two models - the Montlh√©ry Sp√©ciale saloon and Monaco Sp√©ciale hardtop coup√©.

The wagon, which was unique to Australia, was based on the four-door sedan and featured an extended roof-line and a tail-gate fitted with a wind-down window. Australian production of the Aronde ceased in 1964.  Simca Sport  The Simca Sport was a two seater sports car. It originated as a coup√© version of the Simca 8, but with the arrival of the Aronde the Simca Sport acquired a new grill in October 1951, and six months later it gained an extra of wheelbase, from 1952 sharing its wheelbase with the Aronde as well as its (at this stage) 1221 cc (7CV) engine. The Simca Sport would continue to share its engine and other technical components, as well as its wheelbase, with the Aronde until its withdrawal in 1962. It became increasingly expensive and correspondingly rare. Although its origins predated those of the Simca Aronde, the Simca Sport is now usually presented as a low volume stylishly rebodied version of the Aronde. 1952 Simca 9 Sport coup√© The arrival of the wheelbase in 1952 coincided with the loss of a separate chassis, and from now on the Sport used an elegant monocoque body. The new monocoque bodied car was offered only as a two-seater hardtop coup√©, there being for the time being no replacement for the former Simca Sport cabriolet as the monocoque body did not offer the same levels of rigidity. The three- window 9 Sport, using very similar bodywork to the earlier 8 Sport model, arrived in April 1952 but only lasted for less than a year, with the 1953 9 Sport receiving new five-window bodywork from Facel.Chauvin, p. 52 Somewhat heavy and expensive, Simca made the fully equipped version into the standard version and renamed it the Coup√© de Ville in the fall of 1954.Chauvin, p. 57 In October 1952 a cabriolet version of the now chassisless Simca Sport was exhibited, but the cabriolet version only entered production more than two years later in the Spring of 1955, presumably reflecting the challenges involved achieving sufficient structural rigidity in a slim and shapely cabriolet body, without incurring an excessive weight penalty. =Simca Sport: More names and other changes for 1957= The \\"Flash Sp√©cial\\" engine in a 1959 Aronde Oc√©ane, with 57 hp A new generation of the Simca Sport was launched at the 1956 Paris Motor Show. There was, as before, a choice between a two seater sports cabriolet and a two seater sports hardtop. The bodies came from Facel. The cost of organising and producing a coachbuilt body was reflected in the price of the Sport, which at the 1957 Motor show was listed as 1,079,000 francs for the fixed roof \\"Plein Ciel\\" version: this compared with a starting price of 595,000 Francs for the Simca Aronde with which the Sport shared its engine and other mechanical elements. Mechanically and visually the new cars were not so different from those they replaced, but they were readily differentiated by their fashionable wrap-around \\"panoramic\\" windscreens. In 1956 the 1290 cc Flash Sp√©cial engine with was introduced; this was upgraded to during 1960. This was further upgraded in 1961 with the Rush Super engine with five main bearings, when the lower-priced \\"S\\" model was also added. This open topped version was badged as the Simca Sport Oc√©ane. In 1957 the two versions of the Simca Sport received extra names, which was in keeping with the manufacturer's marketing strategy at the time. The Cabriolet version, from which on a sunny day the driver could enjoy an unimpeded view of the sky, was now branded as the Simca Sport Oc√©ane while, bizarrely, the fixed roof version was branded as the Simca Sport Plein Ciel (Simca Sport Open Sky). Although precluded by their prices from becoming big sellers, the eye catching sports models served the company well, adding glamour to Simca show rooms and exhibition stands. = The final years of the Simca Sport = When the Aronde received a reworked body in 1958 there was no corresponding update for the Simca Sport which changed very little after 1957. Under the bonnet/hood, however, the Sport benefited from the upgraded version of the 1290 cc \\"Rush\\" engine, shared with the newly announced Simca Aronde P60 Montlh√©ry Sp√©ciale introduced for both models at the Motor show in October 1961. The uprated \\"Rush Super M\\" engine featured a further increase in compression ratio, now set at 8.5:1, and an increase in power to at 5400 rpm. The result was a small gain in performance and a useful improvement in flexibility. At the end of the 1950s prototype replacements for the Simca Sport were developed and four cars were built, but the project did not progress to production. In 1961 the Sport was still priced at nearly twice the level of the entry level Aronde, and in 1962 production of the car ended without replacement.

William V, Duke of the United Duchies of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg had to relinquish his claims to Guelders and Zutphen in favour of the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain, Charles V of Habsburg.  Background  The Guelders Wars broke out in 1502 over an old, unsettled dispute. At the end of the Second War of the Guelderian Succession (1423‚Äì1448), Gerhard VII, Duke of J√ºlich-Berg sold his claims to the Duchy of Guelders to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. In subsequent years, a long-lastig succession dispute broke out within the Guelders-ruling House of Egmont between Arnold, Duke of Guelders (died 1473) and his son Adolf, Duke of Guelders, which Philip's son Charles the Bold exploited to seize Guelders in 1473. After he died in 1477, the War of the Burgundian Succession broke out, during which his daughter Mary married Maximilian of Austria; thus all Burgundian possessions were acquired by the Habsburgs. However, States of Guelders exploited the confusion to declare independence and proclaim Charles II, son of Adolf, as the new Guelderian duke, with his aunt Catherine as regent. This Guelderian War of Independence (1477‚Äì1499) ended in a Habsburg defeat, and Charles II firmly established his reign with the support of Kingdom of France. In 1502, Maximilian's son Philip the Handsome renewed the war with Charles II in order to recover Guelders, but Charles boldly waged war to defend and expand Guelderian power across the eastern and northern Netherlands during the next 36 years. Intermittently seizing control of Oversticht (modern Overijssel and Drenthe) and Nedersticht (modern Utrecht province) of the Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht, the city of Groningen and its Ommelanden and most of Frisia (modern Friesland), and carrying out raids across Holland and Brabant, Charles II came close to establishing an independent kingdom. When Philip's son Charles V became Holy Roman Emperor in 1519, this decidedly shifted the balance of power in Habsburg's favour; he only had to properly manage his personnel, troops, and resources, but that proved to be difficult as he had to manage all of Europe and the Spanish colonies. In 1538, Charles II died without an heir, and the States of Guelders elected William, Duke of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg to succeed him. William V eventually had to sue for peace in 1543, when all of Guelders, Zutphen and J√ºlich were occupied by Habsburg troops and France failed to come to his aid. The Treaty of Venlo forced him to relinquish Guelders and Zutphen to Charles V, and he had to commit himself to suppressing the rise of Protestantism in his remaining lands of J√ºlich, Cleves, Berg, Mark and Ravenstein, keeping his population Catholic.
