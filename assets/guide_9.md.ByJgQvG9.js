It was constructed at the request of Gopala Bhatta Goswami at around 1542 AD. This temple is among the 7 temples of Thakur of Vrindavan including Sri Radhavallabh ji, Shri Govind Dev ji and four others. The temple is exquisitely crafted and one of the most revered temples in Vrindavan, especially by the followers of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. It houses the original shaligram deity of Krishna alongside Radharani.http://www.salagram.net/sstp- RadhaRamanVrindavan.html The history of Sri Radha Raman Temple History Radha Raman means the lover (ramana) of Srimati Radha. The temple was established over 500 years ago by Gopala Bhatta Goswami. At the age of thirty, Gopala Bhatta Gosvami came to Vrindavana. After Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's disappearance Gopala Bhatta Gosvami felt intense separation from the Lord. To relieve his devotee from the pangs of separation, the Lord instructed Gopala Bhatta in a dream \\"If you want my darshana then make a trip to Nepal\\". In Nepal, Gopala Bhatta bathed in the famous Kali-Gandaki River. Upon dipping his waterpot in the river, he was surprised to see several Shaligrama shilas enter his pot. He dropped the shilas back into the river, but the shilas re-entered his pot when he refilled it. Deity at Radha Raman Temple, Vrindavan. Gopala Bhatta Gosvami found twelve Shaligrama shilas. It is believed that once a wealthy man came to Vrindavana and offered Gopala Bhatta a variety of clothes and ornaments for his Shaligramas in charity. However, Gopala Bhatta couldn't use these for his round-shaped Shaligramas. He advised the donor to give the deity decorations to someone else. It is believed that the donor refused to take them back and Gopala Bhatta kept the clothes and ornaments with his shilas. On the Purnima (full moon) day, in the evening after offering naivedhya to his Shaligrama shilas, Gopala Bhatta put them to rest covering them with a wicker basket. Late in the night, Gopala Bhatta took a little rest. in the early morning he went to take bath in the Yamuna river. Returning from his bath, he uncovered the Shaligramas in order to render puja, and saw amongst them a Deity of Krishna playing the flute. There were now only eleven shilas and a Deity. The \\"Damodara shila\\" had manifested as the beautiful three-fold bending form of tri-bhangananda-krishna. In this way Radha Raman emerged in a perfectly shaped deity form from a sacred shaligrama shila. Devotees consider this image to be alive and that he grants a chosen family the privilege of assisting him in his daily schedule. In this way \\"the Lord has granted his wish and the stone was turned into the murti of Sri Krishna\\". As a narrative account of actualized Krishna-bhakti, Radharamana's appearance story highlights the divine-human relationship of love as the ontologically central category of ultimate reality.p.53 The Prasad for Shri Radha Raman Ji is prepared by the male members of the Goswami families in the temple kitchen. The fire in the kitchen lit in early days of the temple still continues today. The Goswami families are allotted a calendar in advance for their personal seva (service) period and they perform seva accordingly. They also invite their disciples during their period and celebrate major family functions and ceremonies. Inside the temple complex, the samadhi of Srila Gopal Bhatta Goswami is also situated. There the rarely available Unag vastra of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is kept. The current acharya of the temple is Shrivatsa Goswami.

The incident is one of the inspirations for the 1952 baseball book The Natural, made into a film in 1984.  Early life  Steinhagen was the daughter of parents who had emigrated from Berlin, Germany in their early 20s. Born Ruth Catherine Steinhagen, she adopted the middle name Ann at some point in her youth.  Prelude to the incident  A 19-year-old typist at the time of the incident, Steinhagen had developed an obsession with Waitkus after seeing him play as first baseman with the Chicago Cubs. According to a 1949 Time magazine article, she had seen him play in 1946, although John Theodore's 2002 biography of Waitkus indicates she later told her doctor she first saw Waitkus on April 27, 1947. While she never actually met him during that time, at home she created a \\"shrine\\" to Waitkus with hundreds of photographs and newspaper clippings, often spreading them out and looking at them for hours, according to her mother. She would even set an empty place across from her at dinner for Waitkus. Since the ballplayer was from the Boston area, she developed a craving for baked beans, and, because Waitkus was of Lithuanian descent, she even studied Lithuanian for a time. She told her doctors, after the incident, \\"I used to go to all the ball games to watch him. We used to wait for them to come out of the clubhouse after the game, and all the time I was watching I was building in my mind that idea of killing him.\\" In 1948, Steinhagen's family sent her to a psychiatrist, but her obsession didn't diminish, even after Waitkus was traded to Philadelphia. After the shooting, police found extensive clippings in her suitcase and even pictures papering the ceiling of her bedroom.  The shooting  On June 14, 1949, the Phillies came to Chicago for a game against the Cubs. After the game, which she attended, Steinhagen sent Waitkus a handwritten note through a bellboy, inviting him to visit her in her 12th floor room in the Edgewater Beach Hotel where they were both registered. Claiming to be \\"Ruth Anne Burns,\\" Waitkus opened her note: After insisting that she was leaving the hotel the next day and pressing the timeliness of the request, she concluded: According to Waitkus' friend and roommate, Russ Meyer, Waitkus received the note, which was affixed to the door of their 9th-floor room, after 11:00 p.m., after having been out to dinner with Meyer's family and fianc√©e. Waitkus called the room but the woman would not discuss the details over the phone. According to Meyer, Waitkus believed the note was from a friend of Ruth Ann Burns, a woman whom he was dating. The Sunday Gazette Mail says Waitkus knew some people named Burns. Waitkus's son later speculated that his father may have \\"thought he had a hot honey on the line.\\" For whatever reason, he went to meet her in the room. There is variance in the details of what happened in the room. According to an Associated Press report released on June 15, 1949, Steinhagen told police that she told Waitkus when he entered, \\"I have a surprise for you,\\" before retrieving a .22 rifle from the closet and shooting him in the chest. Meyer said that Waitkus told him that when he entered the room, the woman he met claimed to be a friend of Ruth Ann's, introducing herself as Mary Brown, and saying that Ruth Ann would be returning to the room immediately. He said that Waitkus claimed Steinhagen's words after retrieving the gun from the closet were \\"If I can't have you, nobody else can.\\" A 2001 Chicago Times story claims that Steinhagen said, \\"You're not going to bother me anymore.\\" Waitkus, who later said he believed the woman was joking, stood and was shot. He said he asked her, as she knelt beside his prone body with her hand on his, \\"Oh, baby, what did you do that for?\\" Steinhagen indicated that she had planned to stab him, and use the gun to shoot herself, but changed her plans when he quickly took a seat. Steinhagen still intended to shoot herself, but evidently could not find another bullet. While Waitkus was lying on the floor bleeding from the chest, Steinhagen called down to the front desk of the hotel and told them \\"I just shot a man ...\\" Thereafter, according to a Miami News report released on the following day, she went to wait for them on the benches near the elevator, although a much later article in The Washington Times indicates she held Waitkus' head on her lap until help arrived. The phone call, which brought quick medical attention as well as police, saved Waitkus' life.  The aftermath  Steinhagen was arrested and then arraigned on June 30, 1949. Questioned about the shooting, she told police she did not know why she had done it, telling an assistant state's attorney that she wanted \\"to do something exciting in my life.\\" Taken to Waitkus' hospital room the day after the shooting, she told him, as well, that she didn't know for sure why she had done it. She told a psychiatrist before she went to court that \\"I didn't want to be nervous all my life\\", and explained to reporters that \\"the tension had been building up within me, and I thought killing someone would relieve it\\"‚Äî a murderous impulse that had been with her for at least two years. She said she had first seen Waitkus three years before, and that he reminded her \\"of everybody, especially my father.\\" Steinhagen's counsel presented a petition to the court saying that their client was \\"unable to cooperate with counsel in the defense of her cause\\" and did not \\"understand the nature of the charge against her.\\" The petition requested a sanity hearing. At the ensuing sanity hearing (which also occurred on June 30, 1949), Dr. William Haines, a court- appointed psychiatrist, testified that Steinhagen was suffering from \\"schizophrenia in an immature individual\\" and was insane. Chief Judge James McDermott of the Criminal Court of Cook County then directed the jury to find her insane, and ordered her committed to Kankakee State Hospital. The judge also struck \\"with leave to reinstate\\" the grand jury's indictment of Steinhagen on a charge of assault with intent to commit murder, meaning that prosecutors could refile the charge if Steinhagen recovered her sanity. Steinhagen was confined and treated at the institution until 1952, when she was declared cured and released. Waitkus did not press charges against Steinhagen after she was released, telling an assistant state's attorney that he wanted to forget the incident. After her release, Steinhagen moved back home to live with her parents and her younger sister in her parents' small apartment on Chicago's North Side. She shunned publicity in the ensuing decades. Little information is publicly available about the remainder of her life, which was quiet and secluded. She steadfastly maintained her privacy, avoided reporters, and refused to comment publicly on her shooting of Waitkus. Waitkus biographer John Theodore said about her, \\"She chose to live in the shadows and she did a good job of it.\\" It is known that, in 1970, Steinhagen and her family purchased a home in a crowded, racially mixed neighborhood on Chicago's Northwest Side, a few miles from the site of the hotel where she shot Waitkus. She lived in the home for the rest of her life. She lived there with her sister after their parents died in the early 1990s. She continued to live there after her sister died in 2007, employing full-time caregivers in her final years. There is no evidence she ever married. Discoverable evidence of employment that she may have had is virtually nonexistent. A neighbor of hers told John Theodore that Steinhagen had said that she worked in an office job for 35 years, but Steinhagen never told the neighbor where she worked and the neighbor never asked her. Court records and other background checks reveal no information about her career. On December 29, 2012, Steinhagen died in a Chicago hospital of a subdural hematoma that she suffered as a result of an accidental fall in her home. Her death was not publicly reported until nearly three months after it occurred; the Chicago Tribune learned of it while searching death records in connection with another story. Steinhagen was 83 years old, and left no immediate survivors.  Influence  As one of the first instances of what later became known as stalker crimes, the incident for several years \\"had a profoundly anti-aphrodisiacal effect on traveling athletes\\", according to The Boston Globe. It prompted a magazine article from sports writer Al Stump entitled \\"Baseball's Biggest Headache‚Äî Dames!\\" It was fictionalized as one of the inspirations for the 1952 baseball book The Natural, which was made into a film in 1984, where actress Barbara Hershey played the role, inspired by Steinhagen. In 1992, Steinhagen's was the oldest incident among 83 incorporated into \\"Preventing Assassination\\", a Secret Service study of celebrity and political assassinations. The bullet that struck Waitkus lodged in a lung, threatening his life and preventing his returning to baseball for the rest of the season. The incident, which required four surgeries, is said to have influenced Waitkus' career and probably his personal life as well, as his numbers after the shooting were never the same and as he developed a great concern that others might not understand why he had visited Steinhagen's room. He also, according to Meyer, developed a drinking problem after the incident.

From 2001 to 2002, he was assistant to the dean at the North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. From 2005 to 2006, he was an associate-rural administrator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Early political career Rouzer with Jesse Helms in 2000 From 1996 to 2001, Rouzer was a legislative aid and Senior Policy Adviser for U.S. Senators Jesse Helms and Elizabeth Dole. In 2000, he ran for North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture and lost the Republican primary. North Carolina Senate =Elections= In 2008, incumbent Republican State Senator Fred Smith decided to retire in order to run for Governor of North Carolina. Rouzer decided to run and defeated Nena Reeves in the Republican primary 68%‚Äì32%. In the general election, he defeated Kay Carroll 52%‚Äì48%. In 2010, he won re-election with 70% of the vote. =Issues= Rouzer receives a majority of his funding from agribusiness, receiving more than $289,000 from this sector in the 2012 congressional elections. He worked on strengthening laws allowing youths to obtain a drivers license. He is also a proponent for the \\"sea-level rise\\" legislation in 2012 that sought to mandate that only historical data be used to predict future trends. He favors repealing the 2010 health care reform law. In the 2012 election he released a TV ad in which his grandmother promises that the candidate would not cut Medicare if elected. Rouzer believes immigrants should be fluent in English before being granted U.S. citizenship. He is pro-life. =Tenure= In his four years, he has sponsored 17 bills that have become signed into law. =Committee assignments= ;Standing/Select Committees * Agriculture/Environment/Natural Resources (Co-Chairman) * Appropriations on Natural and Economic Resources (Co-Chairman) * Finance * Health Care * Insurance * Judiciary I * Program Evaluation * Select Committee on UNC Board of Governors ;Non-Standing Committee * Agriculture and Forestry Awareness Study Commission (Chairman) * Consolidated Environmental Commission Committee * Joint Legislative Task Force on Diabetes Prevention and Awareness * Environmental Review Commission (Chairman) * Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Information Technology * Joint Regulatory Reform Committee (Chairman) * Revenue Laws Study Committee * Joint Select Committee on Tornado Damage Response Rouzer is a member of the Republican Study Committee. U.S. House of Representatives =Elections= 2012 congressional election After Republican-controlled redistricting, he decided to give up his state senate seat to run in the newly redrawn North Carolina's 7th congressional district and challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Mike McIntyre. His home in Johnston County had been drawn into the district; it had previously been in the 2nd District. In the Republican primary, Rouzer defeated both 2010 nominee Ilario Pantano and Randy Crow, but won just four of the district's twelve counties: Johnston (82%), Sampson (49%), Lenoir (43%), and Hoke (38%). However, his margin in Johnston County, the second-largest county in the reconfigured district, was enough for him to win. The redrawn 7th is much more conservative and Republican than its predecessor. Roll Call rates the election as leans Republican. After an official tabulation showed that Rouzer had lost the election to McIntyre by 655 votes, Rouzer asked for a recount on November 21, 2012. After the recount, Rouzer conceded the race to McIntyre on November 28. It was the closest House race in the country. Mitt Romney carried the district with 56 percent of the vote. 2014 congressional election Rouzer ran for the 7th district again in 2014. McIntyre retired rather than face a rematch. Most pundits believed that with McIntyre's retirement, the seat would be an easy GOP pickup. Even before his near-miss in 2012, the 7th had been trending Republican for some time. Rouzer won the general election with almost 60% of the vote. Upon taking office in January 2015, he became only the second Republican to represent a significant portion of eastern North Carolina in the House since Reconstruction. 2016 congressional election After court-ordered redistricting, Rouzer's district was made slightly more compact. It lost most of its share of Johnston County and was pushed slightly to the east, picking up all of Wilmington‚Äìlong the district's largest city‚Äìas well as Goldsboro. Rouzer was unopposed for the Republican nomination and went on to handily defeat Democrat J. Wesley Casteen in the General Election with 60.9% of the vote. 2018 congressional election Rouzer won a third term to Congress with 55.5 percent of the vote over Democratic candidate Kyle Horton and Constitution Party nominee David Fallin, his narrowest margin of victory so far. Ahead of the election, he sold his home in Benson and bought a home in Wilmington, saying it was \\"a reflection of where I spend the vast majority of my time.\\" =Tenure= Rouzer was sworn into office on January 3, 2015 for the 114th Congress. As of May 2019, he had sponsored 24 pieces of legislation during his tenure, of which 2 became public law. He also co-authored (together with U.S. Senator from North Carolina Thom Tillis) a provision to the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act which gave authority to the United States Secretary of the Interior to designate a World War II Heritage city each year. The provision entered into effect when the legislation was signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2019. Wilmington was expected among the first designated Heritage Cities. =Committee assignments= In the 116th Congress Rouzer serves on the following committees: *Committee on Transport and Infrastructure **Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment **Subcommittee on Highways and Transit **Subcommittee on Aviation *Committee on Agriculture **Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture (Vice-Chair) **Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit References External links * Congressman David Rouzer official U.S. House website * David Rouzer for Congress  - Category:1972 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Living people Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina Category:North Carolina Republicans Category:North Carolina state senators Category:North Carolina State University alumni Category:People from Durham, North Carolina Category:People from Johnston County, North Carolina Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Candidates in the 2012 United States elections ","title":"David Rouzer"},{"id":"35779275","text":"In the context of meteorology, a solenoid is a tube-shaped region in the atmosphere where isobaric (constant pressure) and isopycnal (constant density) surfaces intersect, causing vertical circulation.

(sometimes Oh, Jeff) is a 1964 oil and magna on canvas painting by Roy Lichtenstein. Like many of Lichtenstein's works its title comes from the speech balloon in the painting. Although many sources, such as the Encyclopedia of Art, describe Whaam! and Drowning Girl as Lichtenstein's most famous works, artist Vian Shamounki Borchert believes it is this piece, calling it his Mona Lisa. Borchert notes that this painting captures \\"the magic\\" of its \\"anguished and yes beautiful blue eyed, blond hair, full lips\\" female subject while presenting \\"sad eyes that seem to give in to what seems to be a doomed love affair\\". Measuring 121.9 cm √ó 121.9 cm (48 in √ó 48 in), Oh, Jeff...I Love You, Too...But... is among the most famous of his early romance comic derivative works from the period when he was adapting cartoons and advertisements into his style via Ben-Day dots. The work is said to depict the classic romance-comic story line of temporary adversity. Lichtenstein's sketch for this was done in graphite and colored pencils on paper in a 4 3/4 x 4 3/4 inches (12.1 x 12.1 cm) scale. In the early 1960s, Lichtenstein produced several \\"fantasy drama\\" paintings of women in love affairs with domineering men causing women to be miserable, such as Drowning Girl, Hopeless and In the Car. These works served as prelude to 1964 paintings of innocent \\"girls next door\\" in a variety of tenuous emotional states such as in Oh, Jeff...I Love You, Too...But.... Using only a single frame from its source, Oh, Jeff...I Love You, Too...But...s graphics are quite indicative of frustration, but the text in the speech balloon augment the romantic context and the emotional discord. After 1963, Lichtenstein's comics-based women \\"...look hard, crisp, brittle, and uniformly modish in appearance, as if they all came out of the same pot of makeup.\\" This particular example is one of several that is cropped so closely that the hair flows beyond the edges of the canvas. This was painted at the apex of Lichtenstein's use of enlarged dots, cropping and magnification of the original source. The tragic situations of his subjects makes his works a popular draw at museums. The painting was sold for $210,000 (US$ in dollars) on May 15, 1980 at Sotheby's, New York. At the time, the work was part of the Abrams family collection. As of February 3, 1994, the Los Angeles Times reported that it was part of the Stefan Edlis Collection.

Its publisher described the paper as modern and trendy. History and profile Shams was launched as a tabloid paper in December 2005. Turki bin Khalid bin Faisal, a grandson of Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, was the chairman of the board of directors of Shams Information Company for Publishing and Development that published the paper. It was also reported that he partly owned the paper. Al Wataniya group was also the founder of the daily. There is inconsistent information about the daily print of Shams. The media group publishing the paper gave the number of daily print as 120,000. Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), on the other hand, in its 2006 report described Shams as a modest paper with the daily circulation of 40,000 copies. The Group Plus stated the daily circulation as over 70,000 copies. Shams was staffed mainly by Saudi journalists. Shams was being printed in Riyadh, Dammam and Jeddah. The daily was the first paper in Saudi Arabia, addressing specifically at large youth population. Specifically, it targeted male and female Saudi readers between the ages of 18 to 35 who are interested in modern life-style, but also loyal to Saudi Arabia's conventional customs. Shams mostly covered general local Saudi news and other top news from the world. The content of the paper was varied and insightful, ranging from political news and social issues to business news, and various international and local sports news. It also featured the latest Internet and technology updates, fashion, university topics, cars, and various other entertainment topics. It also attempted to cover the opinions and interests of today's younger generation. Controversy See also; Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy The publication of the Shams was suspended on 20 February 2006 after publishing one of the controversial cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad that caused anger across the Muslim world due to their publication in the Danish daily Jyllands-Posten on 30 September 2005. In fact, this cartoon was printed in Shams next to the articles calling for Saudis to take action against Denmark where the cartoons first published. The paper stated that the cartoon was published to initiate a campaign in Saudi Arabia against Danish interests and Denmark. On 21 March 2006, Shams was relaunched. However, its 32-year-old editor Battal Koss was dismissed in late February 2006 and replaced by Khalaf Harby. Closure At the beginning of February 2012, Shams was closed down due to the conditions beyond its management.

Cadart. Marcellin Gilbert Desboutin (C√©rilly 26 August 1823 - 18 February 1902 Nice) was a French painter, printmaker, and writer. Desboutin always signed himself Baron de Rochefort. Biography Desboutin was born in C√©rilly, Allier on 26 August 1823. His parents were Barth√©l√©my Desboutin, a bodyguard of Louis XVIII, and Baroness Anne-Sophie de Rochefort-Dalie Farges.Ren√©e d'Ulm√®s, \\"Marcellin Desboutin\\" in La Plume, 1900, Slatkine Reprints, Gen√®ve, 1968, p. 748-751. He studied at the Coll√®ge Stanislas de Paris and began studying law while writing dramatic works. In 1845, he joined the studio of sculptor Louis-Jules Etex at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, then he studied painting for two years under Thomas Couture. He then traveled in Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy. In 1857, he acquired a large property near Florence, the Ombrellino, where he led a lavish lifestyle and became friends with Edgar Degas. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 interrupted the performances at the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais of Maurice de Saxe, a play he had written in collaboration with Jules Amigues. In 1873 at the age of 50, ruined by speculations, Desboutin moved to Paris, where he and Degas frequently met‚Äîoften joined by √âdouard Manet‚Äîat the Caf√© Guerbois and the caf√© Nouvelle Ath√®nes. At Manet's home he met √âmile Zola. To make his living, he studied engraving and began a series of drypoint sketches while showing his paintings in exhibitions. He participated in the second exhibition of the Impressionists with six paintings, including Street Singer and The Cellist. He made many portraits of his friends including Edgar Degas, Auguste Renoir, Berthe Morisot, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Eug√®ne Labiche, Nina de Villard, Erik Satie, Jos√©phin P√©ladan, Edmond and Jules de Goncourt. In 1880, longing for the sun drove him to move to Nice, where he remained until 1888. With the discovery, in a villa in Grasse, of five compositions by Fragonard, Desboutin made five wonderful interpretive drypoints: Surprise, Rendezvous, Confidence, the Lover Crowned and Abandoned.Jean Alboise, 'Les peintures d√©coratives de Fragonard √† Grasse grav√©es par Marcellin Desboutin', L'Artiste, March 1890, pp.300‚Äì9; L‚ÄôArtiste, March 1889, p.128. Back in Paris, he helped found the Second National Society of Fine Arts and celebrated his appointment in the order of the Legion of Honour on 8 June 1895 with two hundred guests presided over by Puvis de Chavannes, in one of his favorite restaurants of Montmartre, giving the toast, \\"Gentlemen, drink to Manet in painting, in Chabrier music, Villiers and Duranty in literature!\\".\\"Banquet Desboutin\\", in La Plume, no. 148, 15 June 1895, pp. 286-87 He returned to Nice in 1896 and worked there until his death there in 1902.L'Absinthe, Marcellin Desboutin beside actress Ellen Andr√©e, by Edgar Degas (1876)As a writer, Desboutin, besides Maurice of Saxony, is the author of a translation of Byron's Don Juan and of a drama performed in the late 1880s, Madame Roland. Desboutin himself posed for Manet, Renoir and Degas. He is depicted in Degas' famous 1876 painting L'Absinthe. Two of his sons, Andr√© Mycho (1870-1937) and Tchiquine (1878-1951) were also artists.

It is based loosely on Fredric Brown's short story, \\"Naturally\\", which was originally published in Beyond Fantasy Fiction and later reprinted in the short story collection Honeymoon in Hell. Geometria was shot in Guadalajara, Jalisco in Mexico. It is the tenth short film del Toro directed, though all but 1985's Do√±a Lupe remain unreleased. Del Toro was not satisfied with the original cut of the film, and said that he was not able to finish it the way he wanted to at the time. A director's cut of the film, slightly shorter than the 1987 cut, with a new music score composed by Christopher Drake was included on The Criterion Collection's 2010 release of del Toro's 1993 feature film debut, Cronos. Plot A Mexican widow (Guadalupe del Toro) receives a letter from the high school attended by her son (Fernando Garcia Marin). It informs her that the boy is about to fail his geometry exams for the third time. The woman berates her son, then turns on the television, refusing to speak to him. The boy leaves the room, vowing that he will never fail geometry again. The boy resorts to using black magic in order to pass the exam. In a dark room, he reads from a tome of sorcery, which states, \\"As a protection for the invocation of a major demon, place yourself inside a pentagon drawn with your own blood. This pentagon will be your only protection.\\" The boy proceeds to follow these instructions. While the woman sits in the living room, watching a pastiche of The Exorcist, she hears her son screaming from the next room. When she enters, she finds him standing in the middle of the bloody seal. He shouts a warning, telling her that the pentagon is his only protection. A glowing portal opens in the wall, and a demon (Rodrigo Mora) steps through. The boy asks the demon to grant two wishes. The first is that he will not fail geometry again. The second is the return of his father, Francisco, who died in an accident three months ago. The demon complies with the latter, causing Francisco to materialise immediately. However, he is now a mindless zombie. Francisco kills and eats his wife, while their son looks on in horror, unable to step out of the pentagon for fear of losing its magical protection. The demon commands the boy to surrender, but he refuses to give in, saying that he cannot be harmed while he stands within the pentagon. The demon reasons that he has already granted one of the boy's two wishes: his family is together again. He also points out that what the boy has drawn is not a pentagon, but a hexagon, which offers no magical protection whatsoever. The demon muses that the boy's other wish has also been granted: he will never fail geometry again. Francisco approaches his son from behind and takes hold of his head, tilting it backwards. The boy laments the unfairness of his situation. The demon agrees, and reaches out a hand to take hold of his throat. The screen fades to black as ripping sounds are heard.

Œ≤-Hydroxylation of trimethyllysine by an Œ±-ketoglutarate- dependent mitochondrial dioxygenase. J. Biol. Chem. 1978, 253, 1654‚Äì1659. At least four enzymes are involved in the overall biosynthetic pathway. They are NŒµ-trimethyllysine hydroxylase, 3-hydroxy-NŒµ-trimethyllysine aldolase, 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase and Œ≥-butyrobetaine hydroxylase.  NŒµ-Trimethyllysine hydroxylase  The first enzyme of the L-carnitine biosynthetic pathway is NŒµ-trimethyllysine hydroxylase, an iron and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent oxygenase that also requires ascorbate. Vaz, F. M.; Ofman, R.; Westinga, K.; Back, J. W.; Wanders, R. J. A. Molecular and biochemical characterization of rat Œµ-N-trimethyllysine hydroxylase, the first enzyme of carnitine biosynthesis. J.

The current consensus theory about the origin of NŒµ-trimethyllysine in mammals is that mammals utilise lysosomal or proteasomal degradation of proteins containing NŒµ-trimethyllysine residues as starting point for carnitine biosynthesis.Bremer, J. Biosynthesis of carnitine in vivo. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1961, 48, 622‚Äì624.Wolf, G.; Berger, C. R. A. Studies on the biosynthesis and turnover of carnitine. Arch. Biochem.

An alternative theory involving endogenous non-peptidyl biosynthesis was also proposed, based on evidence gathered from a study involving feeding normal and undernourished human subjects with the amino acid lysine.Khan- Siddiqui, L.; Bamji, M. S. Lysine-carnitine conversion in normal and undernourished adult man ‚Äì suggestion of a nonpeptidyl pathway. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1983, 37, 93‚Äì98. Although NŒµ-trimethyllysine biosynthetic pathway involving NŒµ-trimethyllysine methyltransferase has been fully characterised in fungi including Neurospora crassa, such biosynthetic pathway has never been properly characterised in mammals or humans.Rebouche, C. J.; Broquist, H. P. Carnitine biosynthesis in Neurospora crassa: enzymatic conversion of lysine to Œµ-N-trimethyllysine. J. Bacteriol. 1976, 126, 1207‚Äì1214. A third theory about the origin of NŒµ-trimethyllysine in mammals does not involve biosynthesis at all, but involves direct dietary intake from vegetable foods. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis has confirmed that vegetables contains a significant amount of NŒµ-trimethyllysine.Servillo, L.; Giovane, A.; Cautela, D.; Castaldo, D.; Balestrieri, M. L. Where Does NŒµ-Trimethyllysine for the Carnitine Biosynthesis in Mammals Come from? PLoS ONE 2014, 9, e84589.  3-Hydroxy-NŒµ-trimethyllysine aldolase  The second step of L-carnitine biosynthesis requires the 3-hydroxy-NŒµ-trimethyllysine aldolase enzyme. 3-hydroxy-NŒµ-trimethyllysine aldolase is a pyridoxal phosphate dependent aldolase, and it catalyses the cleavage of 3-hydroxy-NŒµ-trimethyllysine into 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde and glycine. The true identity of 3-hydroxy- NŒµ-trimethyllysine aldolase is elusive and the mammalian gene encoding 3-hydroxy-NŒµ-trimethyllysine aldolase has not been identified. 3-hydroxy-NŒµ- trimethyllysine aldolase activity has been demonstrated in both L-threonine aldolase and serine hydroxymethyltransferase,McNeil, J.

Purification and properties of mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferas. J. Biol. Chem. 1980, 255, 7801‚Äì7806. although whether this is the main catalytic activity of these enzymes remains to be established.  4-N-Trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase  The third enzyme of L-carnitine biosynthesis is 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase.Hulse, J. D.; Henderson, L. M. Carnitine biosynthesis. Purification of 4-N‚Äô-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase from beef liver. J. Biol. Chem. 1980, 255, 1146‚Äì1151. 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase is a NAD+ dependent enzyme. 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase catalyses the dehydrogenation of 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde into gamma-butyrobetaine. Unlike 3-hydroxy-NŒµ- trimethyllysine aldolase, 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase has been identified and purified from many sources including ratVaz, F. M.; Fouchier, S.

Administratively, Baran is subordinate to the city of Orsha. As of 2009, its population was 11,662. History Baran was first mentioned in 1470 and chartered in 1598 by Krzysztof Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. At the time, the area belonged to Poland. In 1772, during the First Partition of Poland, Baran was transferred to Russia and became a selo, a center of Baranskaya Volost of Orshansky Province of Mogilev Governorate. In 1777, the provinces were abolished, and Baran became a selo in Orshansky Uyezd. In 1919, Mogilev Governorate was abolished, and Baran was transferred to Gomel Governorate. In 1920, Orshansky Uyezd with Baran was transferred to Vitebsk Governorate, and in 1924, the governorate was abolished. From 1924, Baran was a part of Orsha Raion, which belonged to Vitebsk Okrug of Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1935, Baran became an urban-type settlement. On January 15, 1938 Vitebsk Region was established, and Orsha Raion with Baran was transferred to the oblast. During the World War II Baran was occupied by the German troops, the Jewish population was executed. A witness to a mass shooting of the Jews of Baran stated, \\"The perpetrators were put together in a special unit of 6 persons. They had a black uniform and machine guns. The policemen threw the Jews in front of the grave, they were then shot by families.\\" In 1960, Orsha was made a city of oblast significance, and Baran was transferred from Orshansky District and became subordinate to the city of Orsha. In 1972, Baran obtained a town status. Economy =Industry= In 1873 Mehzhinsky, an estate owner, founded in Baran a mechanical plant, which was producing nails. During the World War II, the plant was evacuated to the east, and after the war it was restored and started production of radio stations. =Transportation= Baran is located on a highway connecting Orsha with Shklo≈≠ and further with Mogilev. The closest railway station, also on the railway connecting Orsha and Mogilev, is Khorobrovo, just outside the town. Culture and recreation Almost no traces of the old town survived. The only two notable pre-1917 buildings are a poorhouse and a mechanical workshop.

The original (and current) line-up consists of Tom Askew (Guitars), Stephen Hurley (Drums), Simon McCarthy (Guitars) and Ben Wright (Bass / Electronics). Having released their debut album A Beauty To Fight For to critical acclaim in 2007, The Shadow Project split a year later. They reformed in 2011 with their comeback release \\"The Nature Boys\\" being described as \\"stunning' by BBC Introducing in the UK. The band remain firm favourites with Huw Stephens and Sigur R√≥s manager John Best (who had previously invited the band on tour) and are set to release a new record later this year. The Shadow Project are known for their active charity work and recently contributed previously unreleased material to the 'Hope for Japan' charity; releasing a post-rock compilation album to raise money for the victims of the recent T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami disaster.  History  The band formed in late 2003 when former Deben High School friends Tom Askew and Stephen Hurley decided to start writing music together. Hurley recommended Simon McCarthy join the pair as he shared a similar guitar playing style to that of Askew. He agreed and was soon accompanied by Ben Wright to augment electronic flavours into the largely instrumental tracks. Despite being scattered at various universities across England, the material grew quickly and the band played their first gig in their hometown of Felixstowe on 23 December that year. They were joined on stage by another friend, Seni Chanapai, on bass guitar. = Early years: 2004‚Äì2006 = In April 2004 The Shadow Project self-financed their first record. The four-track Objects Appear EP was recorded at Sickroom Studios in Norfolk with Owen Turner of Magoo on production duties. The record attracted local radio interest and the band soon found themselves playing gigs up and down the country (including support slots for the likes of Hot Chip and The Longcut as well as gigs alongside their local childhood heroes The Dawn Parade and Miss Black America). The demand for a full-time bass player led to Stewart Page joining the group (Stewart had played bass in Askew's previous band El Spoonio). Having quickly sold out of EPs, the band returned to the studio in December 2004 to record what would become the Voices EP. Released in January 2005, the record attracted a cult following and the title track would go on to become a fan favourite and the centre piece of their live shows (thanks in part to veteran DJ John Peel who played the track several times). The remainder of 2005 saw the band take to larger stages and festival slots across the UK (with a significant fan base growing in Europe and China). By 2006 the band had signed to independent record label NROne Records in Norwich. A new EP (The Tears in Their Eyes Brought Destruction to the Skies) was recorded at Purple Studios in Trowse, Norfolk, though endless production difficulties led the band to eventually (and reluctantly) discard the recordings. = A Beauty To Fight For and splitting up: 2007 = Whilst the band were disappointed with their latest studio session, NROne Records thought differently and suggested The Shadow Project record an album instead. In February 2007 the band relocated to East London for six weeks to record, mix and master the album. The Way Recording Studio London in Hackney was chosen for its intimate working environment and warm analogue vibe while mastering duties were handed to Mandy Parnell at Electric Mastering, whose previous clients included Bj√∂rk, The Crocketts and Mogwai (all of whom had been influences on the group during their teens). The band have referred to this period of time as the best of their lives though bass player Stewart Page felt unsure of his touring future in the group. This led the band to start rehearsing with friend Tim Phillips on bass guitar. On completion of the record, Stewart decided to stick with the band and Phillips switched to vocals and third guitar. The band were now a six-piece. A Beauty To Fight For was released on 4 June 2007. In its first week it outsold all previous releases on the NROne Records label and remains their biggest selling album to date. BBC Radio 1's Huw Stephens described the record as \\"absolutely gorgeous\\" and promoted the band heavily on his show with regular repeats of his favourite track \\"All The Pretty Things\\". Drowned in Sound praised the band for pushing the post-rock boundaries in their review while German promoters Burning Eagle Bookings offered The Shadow Project their first European tour (the record made their top 100 chart in August 2007). Despite everything coming together for the band, the new dynamic as a six-piece was not clicking and personality clashes coupled with differing musical directions led the band to cease in September 2007 before officially announcing their break-up in early 2008. = Post-breakup: 2007‚Äì2010 = Remaining friends, Stephen, Tim and Tom went on to form indie synth band 'Buried in Pompeii' in 2008 with keyboardist Dan Gregory while Simon went on to play guitar in alt-folk rock band 'elephant'. = Reformation: 2011‚Äìpresent = Following a string of drunken encounters at each other's weddings in the winter of 2010, the four founding members of The Shadow Project decided to put the past behind them and start writing new music together. The first rehearsal took place in May 2011, but it was swiftly followed by an offer to play a comeback show at the Norwich Arts Centre in October. Their first gig in four years (a sell-out), the band included four new songs in their set (alongside \\"Voices\\" and \\"Never Come Down\\" ‚Äì both from the Voices EP). The following week they recorded a live session for the BBC and played a packed house at their favourite local ‚Äì The Swan in Ipswich. In April 2012, they released \\"The Nature Boys\\" ‚Äì their first studio recording since A Beauty To Fight For. The track will be followed by a new record which they are mixing. In May 2012, The Shadow Project were approached by Sky Italia, who requested publishing rights to the track \\"Being Here (So Confusing)\\" for use in a new HD TV campaign to be aired in Italy. = Musical style = The Shadow Project fuse elements of indie, electronica, post-rock, dance, and ambient to create beautiful cinematic rock soundscapes. Vocoders, glitching, drum machines, loops, sampling, chiming guitars and heavy effects processing are characteristic of the band's sound. Influenced by the likes of Radiohead, The Cooper Temple Clause, Daft Punk and Brian Eno, their music is far more expansive and intriguing than that of their post rock contemporaries.

Post-season In 1947, Wooden's first basketball team won the Indiana Intercollegiate Conference title and received an invitation to the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball (NAIB) National Tournament in Kansas City. Wooden refused the invitation, citing the NAIB's policy banning African American players; one of Wooden's players was Clarence Walker, an African-American from East Chicago, Indiana.http://www.indstate.edu/news/news.php?newsid=346 In 1948, after winning their 2nd Conference title, Indiana State was again invited to the NAIB tournament; the NAIB had reversed its policy banning African-American players that year, and Wooden coached his team to the NAIB National Tournament final, losing to Louisville. This was the only championship game a Wooden- coached team ever lost. That year, Walker became the first African-American to play in any post-season intercollegiate basketball tournament, as the NIT and NCAA tournaments did not integrate until after 1950.http://www.indstate.edu/news/news.php?newsid=346 In Kansas City they won their first five games to reach the NAIA Finals.

He was an Honoured Artist of the RSFSR. Biography Boris Lukoshkov was born on June 20, 1922 in the village of Nyunega, currently in Shenkursky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast. He dreamed of becoming an artist from childhood. In 1940 he graduated from high school in Shenkursk; in October of the same year he was drafted into the Red Army. He was nineteen when the Great Patriotic War began. On September 13, 1941, while fighting his way out of an encirclement, in street battles in the town of Lokhvitsa, Poltava Oblast in Ukraine, he was critically wounded. He once again joined the army in the fall of 1943. In June 1944, he was wounded again. Severe injuries and their consequences considerably complicated his future activity as an artist. In 1949 Lukoshkov was admitted to the Leningrad Art College (Tavricheskaya Art School). Upon graduation in 1954, he continued his studies at the Ilya Repin Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (formerly the Imperial Academy of Arts), however, he decided to quit the studies after one year since he was still severely handicapped after the war. Subsequently, he returned to Shenkursk. Due to the fact that he got his education in Leningrad, Boris Lukoshkov is considered as a representative of the Leningrad School of Painting. Between 1955 and 1957 Boris Lukoshkov worked in Shenkursk. Subsequently, he moved to Arkhangelsk to work in the workshops of the Art Fund and the North-West publishing company. In 1957 he for the first time participated in an art exhibition in Arkhangelsk. In 1965 he joined the Union of Artists of the RSFSR. In the 1960s, there was growing interest among Soviet artists in linocut. Linocut is characterised by its brevity and dynamism, speed of execution, and decorative effect. G.A. Ryabokon, V.S. Vezhlivtsev and Lukoshkov, all Arkhangelsk artists, began to work in linocut. The subject of the earlier linocuts by Lukoshkov was associated with his hometown, Shenkursk, and neighborhoods. His linocuts are known for their strict elegance and conciseness. In the late 1960s his linocuts were highly praised and were shown at the All-Union (USSR) art exhibition in Moscow in 1967. By the 1970s Lukoshkov preferred to work with a fine lace mesh of light, casual, or a measured rhythm of light lines in his paintings. In 1971 he was elected for the first time as a Chairman of the Arkhangelsk Union of Artists (1971‚Äì1975, 1979‚Äì1983). In 1972 he was a delegate to third Congress of Union of Artists of the RSFSR, and was elected as a member of the Board. In 1973 he was a delegate to the fourth Congress of Artists of the Soviet Union in Moscow. In 1975 he was awarded the honorary title \\"Honoured Artist of the RSFSR\\". In 1976 he was a delegate to the fourth All-Russian Congress of the Union of Artists. In 1981 he was a delegate to the fifth All-Russian Congress of the Union of Artists, Moscow. In 1983 he was a delegate to the sixth All-Russia Union of Artists, Moscow. Along with linocuts Lukoshkov worked in oil painting, in the traditional realistic style. He created landscapes of villages, fields, sights of the Vaga River, and neighborhoods of Shenkursk. He created his own style of painting the northern landscape. He died in 1989 in Arkhangelsk, and was buried in a village of Izhma, Primorsky District. Exhibitions He participated in the following exhibitions: *All-Union(USSR) (1962, 1963, 1967, 1969) *Republican(RSFSR) (1957, 1965, 1967, 1970, 1972, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1980) *Regional (1964, 1967, 1969, 1974, 1979, 1984) *Arkhangelk from 1957 to 1989 Awards Lukoshkov was awarded honorary medals and diplomas of the Ministry of Culture of the RSFSR, the Secretariat of the Union of Artists of the RSFSR, the Komsomol Central Committee, and the Department of Culture Arhoblispolkoma.

History  The division draws its history from the 75th Naval Rifle Brigade formed in the end of 1941. As part of the 3rd Shock Army, Kalinin Front in 1942 the brigade participated in the Demiansk operations - the Moscow counteroffensive. For its fighting performance it became the 3rd Guards Rifle Brigade in March 1942, having spent all its time in reserve, became the 27th Guards Rifle Division in April‚ÄìMay 1942. With a view to the preservation of fighting and revolutionary traditions of earlier formations, the name \\"Omsk\\" which 27th Rifle Division had during the Russian Civil War had earlier was given to the new division. In the late summer of 1942, it was rushed south to help stop the German offensive into the northern Caucasus and Stalingrad. It took part in the destruction of the German 6th Army during the winter of 1942/43. During World War II the division was part of the 4th Tank Army, 1st Guards Army, the 24th Army, the 66th Army, the 65th Army and since February 1943 the 62nd Army. In April 1942 the 62nd Army became the Eighth Guards Army. In July 1942 the division was part of Kalinin Front's 58th Army, alongside 16th Guards Rifle Division and two other rifle divisions.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1 July 1942 The division was back with the 8th Guards Army of the 1st Belorussian Front in May 1945. The division participated in the Battle of Stalingrad, Izyum- Barvenkovo, Donbass, Zaporozhye, Nikopol-Krivoi Rog, Bereznegova-Snigirovka, Odessa, Lublin - Brest, Pozna≈Ñ, K√ºstrin, Warsaw-Poznan and the Berlin offensive operation. For services in battle the division was awarded the honorific \\"Novobug\\" in March 1944, then awarded the Order of the Red Banner and Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky 2nd degrees. Over 10 thousand of its soldiers were awarded awards and medals, and 7 were awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union. Its commanders included Colonel Konstantin Vindushev (1942), and Viktor Glebov (1942‚Äì1945), Glebov was originally a colonel but was made a general- major in November 1942. Since 1945 the division remained as part of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, where it became 21st Guards Mechanised Division, then 21st Guards Motor Rifle Division on 17 May 1957. On 17 November 1964 it was renamed 27th Guards Motor Rifle Division. It remained in Germany until May 1991, when it was withdrawn to Totskoye in the Volga-Ural Military District. It has contributed many personnel for peacekeeping operations. The division was renamed the 21st Guards Motor Rifle Brigade on 1 June 2009, after the beginning of the 2008 Russian military reform.

It was written by Matthew Weiner and directed by Phil Abraham. It originally aired on the AMC channel in the United States on May 6, 2012. The episode is set in October 1966. Megan has second thoughts on her career path after the success with Heinz but finds it difficult to tell Don. Peggy, unwittingly caught between the two when Megan's lie comes to light, finally expresses her frustrations to both Megan and Don. Pete finds that his increasing success at the firm does not fill the emptiness of his life. After a sexual encounter one evening with a neighbor, he becomes obsessed with wanting to repeat the experience. Don returns to creative work full throttle, only to find the cultural changes of the 1960s have left him behind. \\"Lady Lazarus\\" was watched by 2.29 million viewers during its initial broadcast, and drew in 0.7 million viewers in the coveted 18‚Äì49 demographic. It received considerable acclaim from the television critical community. The episode's title is named after a poem of the same name written by Sylvia Plath. The episode is notable for its use of The Beatles master recording of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" from the album Revolver. Creator Matthew Weiner paid for permission and engaged in a creative collaboration in order to use the song. Plot Pete discusses life insurance with Howard, his commuter friend, who reveals that he has a new, attractive mistress and an apartment in the city. In the train station parking lot one evening, Howard's wife, Beth (Alexis Bledel), asks Pete if he knows her husband and tells Pete she has locked her keys in her car. Pete drives her home, during which time Beth discusses her dire relationship with Howard. He comforts her, and she kisses him, leading them to have sex on the floor of her home. After the incident, Beth tells Pete to forget it happened, which doesn't sit well with him. Pete continues to yearn for Beth afterwards, calling her and even orchestrating a situation in which Howard invites him to dinner with Beth at their home. Before Pete creates an excuse to leave, he tells Beth to meet him at the Hotel Pennsylvania. Pete checks into the hotel. When Beth doesn't arrive, Pete smashes a champagne glass against the wall. Megan wants to get back into acting and begins to resent her job in advertising. After Peggy catches her in a lie meant to cover up her going to an audition, Megan confesses as much to Peggy, who scolds her for taking a high-value job in the agency that others would \\"kill to have\\". Late one night, Megan wakes Don up to tell him of her desire to start acting again, and with Don's apparent blessing, she quits her job at the agency the next morning. Don sees her off to the elevator as she leaves the office. Moments after Megan leaves, Don calls up another elevator. After the elevator doors open, Don looks down to find no elevator, just a bare elevator shaft. He peers down into the empty abyss and then steps backward. Don complains to Megan about not knowing what is going on in youth and popular culture, leading Megan to bring him a copy of The Beatles album Revolver. She tells him to start with the song \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". As Megan leaves for acting class, Don plays the song and sits with a glass of whiskey. He listens to most of the song, but then picks up the needle, turns the record off, and walks back to his bedroom in silence. The song immediately resumes during the end credits. Production The episode was written by series creator Matthew Weiner and directed by Phil Abraham. Matthew Weiner expanded on the significance of the empty elevator shaft: > \\"In my mind, that actually happened. The elevator wasn‚Äôt there, which we > know happens all the time. I thought that was an amazing cinematic > representation of his emotional state. He still had one thing left to say to > her, and she‚Äôs gone, into the abyss. She‚Äôs gone off on her own. That‚Äôs all > that that was supposed to be. Is someone going to fall down an elevator > shaft? No. I will actually go on record as saying that.\\" Reception =Ratings= \\"Lady Lazarus\\" was viewed by 2.29 million viewers on the night of its original airing. It drew 0.7 million viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Critical reception= The episode received praise from television critics. The Hollywood Reporter Tim Goodman stated: > \\"There might be better Mad Men episodes to come, but at this point I'd say > Lady Lazarus is the episode Matt Weiner should win an Emmy for writing. He's > truly in command here and he's touching on so many longtime Mad Men truisms > ‚Äì including the main one, existentialism ‚Äì that he makes it look > effortless.\\" Emily VanderWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A grade: > \\"'Lady Lazarus' feels big. It feels like a Rosetta Stone for the season, one > that we don't have all of the pieces to read just yet, but an episode that > will seem even more obviously great in retrospect once we do. At the same > time, though, analyzing it feels ever more like taking hold of one thing and > trying to make it stand in for the episode as a whole.\\" TIME magazine writer Nate Rawlings stated: > \\"If Megan's phone-booth conversation was the beginning of a new and exciting > chapter in her life, Pete Campbell's off-the-record chat was certainly the > low point in a year that has seen his life spiral out of control. > Professionally, things could hardly be going better for Pete.

Background Juedeman was born in the community of Slick in Creek County in east central Oklahoma. From 1953 to 1959, while a wheat farmer in Toole County on the Canada‚ÄìUS border, he served three terms in the Montana House of Representatives, including a stint as the House Majority Leader. He was also the Montana state Republican Party chairman. Political life In 1958, he moved to Odessa in Ector County in West Texas to enter the oil and natural gas business with his brother-in-law, Morris Ford \\"Jake\\" Lawless (1903‚Äì1986). Within the next several years, Juedeman exerted a behind-the-scenes role in the development of the Permian Basin division of the Texas Republican Party and did not always receive proper recognition for his role as the original \\"Mr. Republican\\" of Ector County. In Juedeman's obituary in the Odessa American, the paragraph on politics describes him as a > mainstay of the Texas Republican Party, one instrumental in building an > effective party apparatus in Ector County during the early 1960s, an era > when state and local politics [was] dominated by the Democratic Party. > Relying on his experience ... in Montana politics, Juedeman mentored young > Republican candidates running for office, advised the party faithful on the > creation of an effective vote-getting organization, and campaigned > tirelessly for Texas Republican issues and candidates for over three > decades.

In 1962, Juedeman was credited with exerting a major role in the election of Ed Foreman to Texas's 16th congressional district, the lines of which then stretched from El Paso to the Permian Basin.

On Juedeman's death, Jim Reese, the mayor of Odessa from 1968 to 1974 and two-time candidate for Texas's 19th congressional district seat, told the Odessa American: \\"He was active in Republican Party activities out here when you could fit us all in a phone booth. ...

At its inception, the service garnered considerable media attention for introducing \\"crowdvoting\\" as a way to settle less serious disputes using \\"the wisdom of the crowds\\" as an alternative to litigating in small claims court, by encouraging people on the internet to vote on cases and register their opinions. This, however, was not a legally binding resolution. Since then eQuibbly has discontinued this public form of resolving disputes, as well as mediation.

In a career which lasted from October 2000 until May 2002, he ran ten times and won three races. He recorded his most important success when winning the Classic St. Leger Stakes as a three-year-old in 2001. In the same year also won the Great Voltigeur Stakes and finished second in the Breeders' Cup Turf. He was retired after being injured in his only race as a four-year-old. Background Milan is a bay horse with a large white star and four white feet, who was bred at the Fittocks Stud at Upend, Newmarket in Suffolk. The stud is managed by Sara Cumani, the wife of the trainer Luca Cumani. Milan is one of numerous top- class middle-distance runners sired by the thirteen-time Champion sire Sadler's Wells. His dam Kithanga was a successful racemare who won the St. Simon Stakes and finished third in the Irish St. Leger. As a yearling, Milan was set to the Tattersalls sales at Newmarket, where he was bought for 650,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Dermot \\"Demi\\" O'Byrne on behalf of the Coolmore organisation. Like many of the Coolmore horses he was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. He was registered for racing purposes as being owned by either Michael Tabor, Susan Magnier or a partnership of the two. Racing career =2000: two-year-old season= Milan did not appear until the autumn of his two-year-old season when he began his racing career at the Curragh on 15 October. Contesting the Kildare Maiden Stakes he was ridden by Colm O'Donoghue and started at odds of 9/1 in a field of twenty-two runners. Milan tracked the leaders before moving into the lead a furlong from the finish and quickened clear to win \\"easily\\" by three and a half lengths from his stable companion Leopard Spot. =2001: three-year-old season= Milan began his three-year-old season in the Listed Ballysax Stakes at Leopardstown on 16 April. He started at odds of 7/1 and finished second to the subsequent Epsom Derby winner Galileo, with Vinnie Roe in third. With his stable companion Galileo aimed for the Derby, Milan was sent to contest Group One races in France. He finished a half length third to Chichicastenago in the Prix Lupin at Longchamp in May after which O'Brien called Milan \\"still a big baby\\" In the Prix du Jockey Club at Chantilly in June he was poorly drawn and stumbled exiting the stalls before finishing \\"powerfully\\" to take fifth place behind Anabaa Blue. In these races he was ridden by Mick Kinane who rode Milan in all his subsequent races. Later in June, Milan started favourite for the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot but finished fourth of the twelve runners behind Storming Home. Milan and Storming Home met again in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York in August. On this occasion, Milan started second favourite at 6/1, despite receiving three pounds from his English-trained opponent. Kinane restrained Milan in the early stages before moving him forward in the straight. He took the lead a furlong from the finish and stayed on to beat Storming Home by one and a half lengths. Aidan O'Brien explained that the colt had been given a break since things had happened \\"a bit quick for him\\" in France and at Ascot, and that he had been looking fresh in training. The Racing Post described Milan as looking \\"stylish and progressive\\". At Doncaster on 15 September, Milan started the 13/8 favourite for the St Leger against nine opponents over fourteen and a half furlongs. Milan was held up at the rear of the field before making steady progress but appeared to be boxed in on the rail before being switched to the outside in the straight. He took the lead a furlong from the finish and pulled clear of the field with what the BBC described as an \\"incredible burst of speed\\" to win by five lengths from Demophilos and Mr Combustible. Kinane, winning the race at his first attempt at the age of forty-two, described Milan as \\"the class horse in the race\\". Following his Classic win, Milan was brought back in distance to contest the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp. As part of the Ballydoyle entry, he started 4.8/1 third favourite. He stayed on steadily in the straight, but was never able to reach the leaders and finished fifth behind Sakhee. The final start of Milan's three-year-old season saw him race outside Europe for the only time as he was sent to Belmont Park for the Breeders' Cup Turf. He was towards the rear of the eleven horse field for much of the way before moving into fourth place at the turn into the straight. In the closing stages he stayed on strongly but failed by three quarters of a length to catch the leader Fantastic Light with the two European horses finishing almost six lengths clear of the rest of the runners. =2002: four- year-old season= On his four-year-old debut, Milan was made evens favourite for the Mooresbridge Stakes at the Curragh on 6 May 2002. He had been considered doubtful for the race after sustaining a bruised foot in training, but was cleared to run after an X-ray examination. He raced in third place before sustaining an injury and being pulled-up by Kinane approaching the straight. The injury proved to be fracture of the colt's cannon bone, and Milan was retired to stud. Stud career Milan was retired to stand for his owners' Coolmore Stud organisation and has been primarily marketed as a National Hunt Stallion. He is currently based at the Grange Stud, Fermoy, County Cork, where he stands at a stud fee of ‚Ç¨5,000. His winners include Jezki, Darlan, Raya Star (Scottish Champion Hurdle) and One For Arthur.

Sir Henry de Turberville (died 1239)Also Turbeville, Trubleville, or Trubbeville. Trubleville corresponds to the Norman village Troubleville, Eure, from which the name is derived., was a noted English soldier and Seneschal of Gascony (1227‚Äì1230, 1234‚Äì1237 and 1238). Life He was the son of Robert Turberville. In the latter part of John of England's reign Trubleville had already gained a reputation as a famous soldier. He was loyal to John to the end. In the last year of that king's reign he was employed to pay soldiers at Rochester, and rewarded with forfeited lands, some of which were in Devon. Trubleville continued to be employed under Henry III of England. In 1217 he took a prominent share in helping Hubert de Burgh to win his victory over the French fleet commanded by Eustace the Monk in the Straits of Dover. Grants of land in Wiltshire, Suffolk, Lincolnshire, Bedfordshire, and Devon were now made to him. Before 19 October 1226 Trubleville was appointed seneschal of Gascony, holding the post until 1231. The rule of the young Richard of Cornwall had distracted the country; and Trubleville's correspondence with Henry III shows him contending with want of money, a revolt in Bayonne, a conspiracy in Bordeaux, disputes with the viscount of B√©arn, and unsettled relations with the French king. In June 1228 he was the chief negotiator of a truce with France signed at Nogent. He importuned the king to relieve him of his governorship; but Henry answered that he must retain it until the king himself visited Gascony. However, on 1 July 1231 Trubleville was superseded, and in 1232 he was again in England. In 1233 Trubleville distinguished himself in the Welsh war that resulted from the revolt of Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. Carmarthen was besieged by Rhys Grug and the Welsh forces who had risen in the interests of the Marshals. Trubleville took a force of soldiers on shipboard from Bristol and sailed up the River Towy to the beleaguered castle and town. The bridge over the river, which was immediately below the castle, was held by the Welsh rebels. Trublevillebroke the bridge by the impact of his ship and captured its defenders or immersed them in the river. Trubleville was reappointed seneschal of Gascony on 23 May 1234, and was ordered to be at Portsmouth by Ascensiontide to command a force destined to help Peter, Count of Brittany. He fought actively in this cause, but Peter proved faithless, and Trubleville was soon again in Gascony. He was seneschal, with a short break in 1237, until the end of November 1238. After Easter 1238 Trubleville was sent by Henry III at the head of an English force destined to help his brother-in-law, the Emperor Frederick II, against the rebellious Lombards. He was subsequently joined by William, bishop-elect of Valence, Queen Eleanor of Provence's uncle, who seems to have assumed the command. They fought successfully for the whole summer against the Lombards. A victory over the citizens of Piacenza was won on 23 August. They were recalled before the renewal of Frederick's excommunication. The emperor testified by letter his great obligations to Turberville. Turberville returned to England, and on 12 November 1239 was one of the numerous band of nobles who, headed by Richard of Cornwall, bound themselves by oath to go on crusade. He died, however, on 21 December 1239. Family Turberville had a wife named Hawise, who survived him, and had her dower assigned from his Devon estates. He also left a daughter named Edelina, who married a Saintongeais named Elie de Bl√©nac. Grants of money and kind from the Bordeaux exchequer were bestowed on her after her father's death. She was apparently illegitimate: the Melcombe estates of her father went to the Binghams through Lucy, Henry's sister, who married into that family.

An extensive photographic study of the house, then only a few years old, was taken for the Winter 1967 issue of Harvard Art Review. In his 1989 work, Architecture and Urbanism, Henry Plummer concluded of this house that it contained \\"innumerable locales, of fragmentary rooms loosely interlocked, of zones both intimate and grand, created for an almost endless array of eyes, and heads and bodies and voices, an abundance which no longer bears upon the needs of a single person. Not only does the building form evolve but it is never perceived by two persons in quite the same way.\\" In his 1967 work, World Architecture 4, John Donat described this house as \\"a place that prescribes nothing, an architecture that is intense without imposing itself on you.\\" He goes on to write that this family house is \\"a place of real options and opportunities [that] can be richly interpreted by whoever is living in it.\\" MIT School of Architecture Chair Mark Jarzombek wrote in 2013, \\"Indian Hill House ‚Äì in a more restrained clean modernist aesthetic ‚Äî is different from [Smith's] own house in many respects.

Grach and I.U. Sambu and published in 1971. The culture is named after the site of the Aldy-Bel I kurgan. More than 30 kurgan burial complexes are identified within the Aldy-Bel culture. The culture is a continuation of the nomadic Pazyryk culture in the area of Altai Mountains in South Siberia. The monuments of the Aldy-Bel culture are synchronous and in many respects similar with those of the Mayemir culture in the Altai region and the Tasmola culture of Central Kazakhstan. The geographical spread covers the right bank of the Yenisei south of the Uyuk ridge, the Khemchik River, deep into the Sayan Canyon and the Western Sayan. Typologically, the monuments are adjacent to similar kurgan burials in different areas of Tuva. D.G. Savinov theorizes that, at the end of the 8th or beginning of the 7th century BCE, the Aldy-Bel people were part of the Arzhan tribal union that formed the Aldy-Bel culture and was headed by a ruling dynasty. The Arzhan royal kurgan is located in the area south of the Uyuk ridge and is connected by passages with the main area of the Aldy-Bel culture. The proximity of the Aldy-Bel tribes probably accounted for close ethnic connections of the Arzhan people with the Aldy-Bel people. After the fall of the Arzhan tribal alliance, the Aldy-Bel people retained their independence for a long time, at least throughout 7th and 6th centuries BC, but because of peculiarities of their social organization, there did not arise an elite ruling layer similar to the Arzhan dynasty among them.Savinov D.G., Early nomads, pp. 78‚Äì79, 100‚Äì101 Kurgan burials The Aldy-Bel culture is known through its kurgans. They are rounded or oval mounds of boulders or rock fragments with larger stones at the base, 8 to 12 m across and 1 m height on average, grouped in pairs or occasionally three, located next to each other along a north‚Äìsouth axis. Typically there are several burials in a kurgan, up to seven or more: a central burial in a box of massive stone slabs, with other graves of younger people and children in smaller stone or wooden boxes on the sides except for eastern side. The graves are covered with stone slabs. The kurgans contain mixed types of graves, with logs, stone boxes and dugouts. Burials are mostly solitary. The buried are laid in a crouched position, predominantly on the left side. The main burial is orientated with its head to the west, the others may somewhat deviate depending on their location in the kurgan. A typical feature is the deposition of horse harnesses at the side of the central burial pit, but in contrast with the Arzhan-period monuments there are as a rule no accompanying horse burials.Savinov D.G., Early nomads, pp. 84‚Äì85 So-called \\"moustached kurgans\\" with stone curves, most typical for Early Nomads of Kazakhstan, are also known in Tuva. Stone structures with spherical tops on the ends of the \\"moustaches\\" in Kazakhstan are analogus to Aldy-Bel surface structures in Tuva. Some undisturbed kurgans contain in situ well preserved fencing and deer stones, with an excellent accompanying complex of artifacts similar to other monuments in the Altai, also linking the Aldy-Bel monuments with the Tasmolin culture in central Kazakhstan.Savinov D.G., Early nomads, pp. 94‚Äì95 Art Aldy-Bel art depicts images of animals in tiptoe position and compositions of entwined figures in a form of \\"mysterious picture\\". Aldy- Bel art complex is numerous and varied, most typical for the early Scythian time, reflecting very stable cultural tradition.Savinov D.G., Early nomads, pp. 83‚Äì84 Among such artistic traits are hoof-type markings that ascend to early Scythian time and are found in nomadic cultures in Middle Asia, central Kazakhstan, and Aldy-Bel culture.Savinov D.G., Early nomads, pp. 93‚Äì94 Population The Aldy-Bel population was studied craniologically, odontologically, and genetically, enabling researchers to trace population and its changes in time. In terms of physical anthropology, the substrate population of the Aldy-Bel culture which lived in the mountainous regions of the Altai and Sayan Mountains (central Tuva) belonged to the autochthonous community named Early Nomads, a continuum of early nomadic peoples across Siberia and the Central Eurasian steppe lands from the Tarim Basin to the Black Sea. This substrate ascends to the Southern Eurasian Anthropological Formation, an ancient Eurasian morphological type of the transitional zone of southern Eurasia. It probably formed as a result of an early Old-European (cro-magnoid) migration assimilating an ancient Siberian substratum, and is often associated with the spread of the Uralic languages. This Southern Eurasian Anthropological Formation is described as: In the second half of the 6th century BCE a new Caucasoid component, genetically ascending to the horse pastoralist population of the northern regions of Asia Minor and southern regions of Central Asia, joined the substrate population in the Altai Mountains. At the final stage of the Aldy-Bel culture in the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE a component associated with the milieu of the early Sarmatian population joined to the Aldy-Bel population, and at the end of the 3rd century BCE there is a noted impetus from Northern Chinese populations in the area.Chikisheva T.A., Dynamics of anthropological differentiation, section Conclusions Genetics In 2019, a genetic study of remains from the Aldy-Bel culture was published in Human Genetics. The majority of the samples(9/17) were found to be carriers of haplogroup R1a, including two carriers of haplogroup R1a1a1b2. East Asian admixtures were also detected, as 6 haplogroup Q-L54(including 5 in Sagly culture) samples and 1 haplogroup N-M231 sample were also excavated. Significant patrilineal genetic differences were found between the Aldy-Bel people and the Scythians of the Pontic steppe. The two groups appear to have been of completely different paternal origins, with almost no paternal gene flow between them. Related cultures In addition to kinship with the neighboring Mayemir and Tasmolin cultures, many Aldy-Bel structural and artistic similarities extend further to the west, to the Tagisken and Uygarak complexes of Central-Asia. In the opinion of D.G. Savinov, the broad region from central Kazakhstan to the Yenisei was affected by migrations not detected in archaeological evidence, mainly from west to east. Some portion of that population, most visible in the Tasmolin culture, merged with the emerging Aldy-Bel culture.Savinov D.G., Early nomads, pp. 93‚Äì94 References Literature * Savinov D.G., –†–∞–Ω–Ω–∏–µ –∫–æ—á–µ–≤–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –í–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω–µ–≥–æ –ï–Ω–∏—Å–µ—è. –ê—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã –∏ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–æ–≥–µ–Ω–µ–∑.

Sometimes the bar facilitates consignment bike sales.Interview with the owners. May 2, 2012. History  Mike Wozniak and Josh Gifford met in Norman where they worked at Chili's circa 1994. After both moving to Tulsa, they bartendered together at Empire Bar and the Brook, where they aspired to have their own establishment so that they could have a venue for their own creative endeavors in music and video. Eventually, they started a company called Creative Juices that made wedding videos and art. To finance the bar, they took out personal lines of credit that were secured by Josh's life insurance policy and Mike's house. Doug Dijarne at Bank of Oklahoma handled the financing. Contractor Mickey Payne found the space near Cain's, noting it would be a good spot because the ticket line from Cain's often stretches past the space that was to become the bar. Once money and name were in place, Mike and Josh enlisted the help of Duvall Architects (the firm that also designed Vintage 1740 and the Dust Bowl in Tulsa) and contractor Mickey Payne of Happy Hammer, along with Roger Condray welder who did much of the bar's fixtures and signs. Artist Anne-Marie Foy did the iconic SOUNDPONY moss sign inside the bar. In addition to the short-lived band, the SOUNDPONY race team existed before the bar, though they were incorporated in July, 2005. The Bar opened May 2006 and tends to attract a diverse and varied crowd. As Mike states, ‚ÄúThe bar has changed and evolved over time in a very organic way. Just like we envisioned.‚Äù The Name People often wonder how the bar got its name. One year when Mike was in Vail, he called Josh who was at the moment playing music with a band back in Tulsa. Someone yelled out, ‚ÄúWe are the fabulous SOUNDPONY.‚Äù Eventually, drawing on the myth, the word got tied to the idea of a good horse, riding, racing, and then bikes, any form of alternate transportation. As Josh put it, ‚ÄúLegend has it that Johnny Rotten, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, James Earl Jones, Conan, Bob Newhart, and a horse had an orgy and out blasted the SOUNDPONY.‚Äù  Sponsorships and enthusiasts The SOUNDPONY is known for sponsoring cycling, art, music. Bands that have performed at the Pony include Marbin, Pontiak, Klondike 5, Sweet Baby Jaysus, The Eastern Sea and Oilhouse.

Both the Swedish and Polish army were commanded by their kings ‚Äì Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden and Sigismund III Vasa. The battle ended with a victory for Sweden. However, Polish and Swedish armies had different objectives. Sigismund Vasa wanted to protect Gda≈Ñsk from besieging. Gustav had to protect Gniew, which was important for the prestige for his army. Prelude After the seizure of Livonia on July 6, 1626 Swedish troops landed in the strength of about 13,000 men and 80 guns, in Pi≈Çawa at the port of Duke of Prussia George Wilhelm who was at the vassal of the Polish king but also a brother in law of the king of Sweden. Pi≈Çawa did not offer any resistance which together with the subsequent activity of Prussian soldiers and the attitude of George William, formed the basis of treason accusations leveled at them by the Poles. The Swedes set off a rapid march from Pi≈Çawa in the southwest direction, against the Vistula, taking several small towns along the way, as well as the second largest city of Royal Prussia, ElblƒÖg. Newly landing troops also took Puck, as well as several other towns and the crossing of the Vistula ‚Äî Tczew, Gniew and G≈Çowa Gda≈Ñska. The remaining and most serious obstacle was Gda≈Ñsk. Gda≈Ñsk was a big urban center which at that time had more than 64,000 inhabitants (about four times that of Stockholm, the capital of Sweden). Initially the Swedes tried to negotiate with the city but these were soon broken off due to the unyielding attitude of Gda≈Ñsk's inhabitants. Feeling threatened, the citizens of Gda≈Ñsk begged the Polish king for help. It then became crucial for the main Polish army to make its way to Royal Prussia. The mobilization in Poland, given existing conditions, ran smoothly; despite being low on funds, Sigismund managed to raise an army in a little more than two months. The Polish king and his army (6780 cavalry, 4430 infantry, 20 guns) then rushed to help the city. Battle Gustavus Adolphus, who had 8,150 infantry, 1,700 cavalry and 74 guns, tried to create a base of operations in order to attack Gdansk. For this purpose the Swedes began construction of a bridge over the Vistula leading to Wielkie ≈ªu≈Çawy. Receiving the news of the siege of Gniew by Sigismund III, Gustav moved to rescue the town which was defended by 200 men, and on his way took Walichnowy, on September 11. Sigismund III Vasa, besieging the city, moved his forces to the north, near Ciep≈Çe, and then took positions on a steep bank. Gniew was of great strategic value for the Swedes, who needed the town to cover the flank of Tczew, where great portions of men were being assembled. =22 September= Gustavus Adolphus took the initiative on September 22. With a force consisting of 2,000 infantry and 1,200 cavalry, he started his march from Walichn√≥w in the direction of Gniew under the cover of flood embankments along the bank of the Vistula. In order to scout out Polish entrenchments he led 900 men (30% of his force), and soon the two sides met. The fighting surged back and forth; winged hussars attacked the German reiters under the command of Heinrich von Thurn who fled into the woods, but were later repulsed by the Swedish infantry, and due to the fact that the area was traversed by ditches which made it difficult for the hussars to charge. The Poles then sent infantry and three squadrons of light cavalry to the left wing of the Swedes and forced them out of the flood embankments of which they captured. At the same time two regiments of light cavalry struck the Swedes' flank and scattered them. However, Gustavus rounded up the remainder of his forces and managed to repel the attacking Poles, whom in their rout rode over their own infantry lines. A cease fire took place the next day while both sides buried their dead, although during the skirmish both sides suffered only light casualties. Between 13 and 50 Poles died. Swedish losses were higher. Poles counted 360-500 Swedish killed on the battlefield. =29 September= The fighting on the next day took place on two separate areas, one near the village of Gronowo where the Swedish troops had positioned themselves behind fortifications. Poles tried to provoke the Swedes into leaving their advantageous positions. However, as there were only 200 of them, the Swedish commander, general Muschamp refused. After initial engagements Polish infantry attacked the Swedish positions but were held back by the musketeers. After two hours of fighting the Poles received further infantry reinforcements and the Swedes began to retreat, which encouraged the Poles to send in a cavalry charge, composed of two squadrons of hussars and 400 reiters. The Swedes counterattacked with fresh cavalry units but were beaten back, so was the Polish charge which collapsed after suffering significant casualties by the Swedish infantry and cannon fire, as well as by the difficult terrain they had to get through. The Polish artillery which sequentially had bombarded against the village had been rather ineffective; mainly due to the inaccurate fire which had gone mainly over the Swedish positions. In the meantime, the Poles launched another assault on general Von Thurns regiment who had camped on the previous fighting ground of 22 September, but the Poles were beaten back. During this day, Gustavus had learned that Swedish infantry could beat back the renowned Polish cavalry, if fought during rather protected circumstances. The Poles had suffered no great loss, around 18‚Äì43 were dead. Swedish losses were about equal to those of the Poles. =1 October= On October 1, the last and main event of the battle took place. Previous day passed quietly; both sides only strengthened their defensive positions. Swedes built a fort and entrenchments near the dam, so they could shoot Polish cavalry who tried to go down to the plain under the hills. In this way Gustavus Adolphus could cover his troops, which were planned to enter into the Vistula corridor. On the night of September 30 to October 1, one of the Swedish soldiers in the garrison of Gniew managed to sneak out of the town and inform Gustavus Adolphus about the terrible situation where the besieged crew started to suffer water because it has been cut off. Gustavus Adolphus decided to make an attempt to break through to the city. The Swedish plan was simple; Gustavus intended to distract the Poles from the main direction of impact and break through to Gniew. Main attack was to go down by the corridor along Vistula and binding fight were to take place on the fields between the Gronowo and the Polish hills. Plan was simple but its implementation went much worse. With about 4,000 men, the Swedes launched the attack On 1 October. Barely in the field under Gronowo, the Swedes began to emerge but were attacked by a Polish reiter squadron. A sixfold reiter charge disincentived the Swedes to stay in the field and they retreated back to the entrenchments. The diverted attention of the Poles from the Vistula corridor had failed. But Gustavus Adolphus did not abandon his plans to break through to Gniew. In another attack along the Vistula corridor, the Swedes once again were beaten back during a long violent struggle against some newly built Polish entrenchments, guarding across the corridor and blocking the way to Gniew. However, it was not the end of the battle. Gustavus Adolphus then executed a massive assault and ordered his infantry to approach on the Polish positions on the hills. The Swedes marched through the bushes, in addition, hid behind branches, and later with a fierce assault, entered the hill and killed the Polish soldiers positioned there. They were, however, immediately fired at by another Polish regiment a distance away, whereof they began digging entrenchments to initiate a Polish counter assault. ‚Äî The point of entry was chosen very well, bushes and branches provided an hidden entrance to the hill where the Poles had not dug any entrenchments. After some struggle, the remaining Polish infantry and riders on the hill were beaten back and started to rout. The Poles then carried out a counter assault consisted of hussars, which managed to drive the first line of the Swedes from the hill, but was later repulsed by the second one. The Polish cavalry retreated in disorder and the Swedes re-entered and continued their digging of entrenchments. Polish infantry renewed an attack on the Swedes which lasted for about two hours, hence the Poles had to retreat due to the lack of gunpowder. On the night of October 1, the Poles set fire to the farm Ciep≈Çe. Taking advantage of the darkness, the Poles later left their entrenchments of the corridor, and the siege was then finally lifted. Gustavus then reinforced the castle garrison and boats were sent in with stocks. Neither side moved against each other and the battle ended. The Swedish losses that day were counted to 30 men killed. The Polish casualties were higher, with about 500 dead and three standards lost. Sigismund then marched against Gda≈Ñsk to protect it from returning to the Swedes and the opportunity to obtain the gunpowder. Aftermath Although the Swedish army had lifted the Polish siege of Gniew and Sigismund had withdrawn from the field, he still achieved progress and the upper hand to block the city of Gda≈Ñsk from Swedish troops before their arrival. Therefore, the withdrawal has to be considered somewhat tactical in purpose for the strategical overview. The battle of Mewe marked the first time Swedish infantry had successfully stood their ground against Polish hussars, even though being behind entrenchments it was an achievement for Gustavus Swedish infantry whose accurate and devastating fire had proved to be the decisive factor of the battle. The Age of Wars of Religion, 1000-1650, Cathal J. Nolan, p. 374 Thus, he fell ill in October the great assault on Gda≈Ñsk Gustavus had desired couldn't be executed, and the pursuit of Sigismund couldn't take place.

Swedish forces were led by Gustav Horn and Hans Wrangel. Lithuanian forces were led by Aleksander Gosiewski. The Swedes won the battle. Opposing forces The Swedish army of 1,900 infantry (mainly musketeers) and 1,780 cavalry under the command of Gustav Horn had reached Drobbusch late on December 2, and there decided to establish a camp for the troops to rest. However, as there were not enough houses for the whole army, only the infantry was quartered within the village, and the cavalry instead rested in nearby woods. During this time, unbeknownst to the Swedes, the Polish field marshal Aleksander Gosiewski approached in their direction with his army of 4,000 (according to previously captured Lithuanian prisoners). Gosiewski's aim was to evict the Swedish troops from the village via a surprise attack. At dawn of the next day, November 3, Gosiewski reached the village and executed the attack. Battle of Wenden Gustaf Horn, the Swedish military commander at the battle. The Lithuanians tried to sweep through the entrances of the roads leading to the village, but were repulsed by Swedish sentry detachments long enough for further Swedish support to arrive from the village. Meanwhile, two banners of Cossack (Kozacy) cavalry attempted to cross through the woods in order to outflank the Swedes but were engaged and stopped by a detachment of musketeers. After some fierce fighting in hand-to-hand combat the Lithuanian infantry was repulsed after having suffered several killed and captured. Horn, then took the initiative and with some musketeers, forced the Lithuanian cavalry away from their advantageous position which had been preventing the Swedish cavalry from participate in the battle. Then, being able to deploy, one Swedish squadron of Finnish cavalry managed to charge and rout, according to letters of Swedish generals, five squadrons of Lithuanian hussars who lost four banners. After a short but fierce fighting the remains of the Lithuanian army were defeated. The Swedish casualties of the battle were light. The Lithuanians however, lost 400 men dead, 40 captured and eight banners. Aftermath After the battle the Swedes remained at Drobbusch for two days in order to gather supplies before moving south to push Gosiewski out of Livonia and into Courland. After Gosiewski crossed the D√ºna river at Yxkull De la Gardie and Horn had to halt their pursuit due to the lack of winter clothing which caused a lot of casualties among the troops from sickness and frostbite. Horn assembled a small force of some 300 cavalry and 200 musketeers, with which he intended to clear out the Lithuanian positions west of the river Ewst. On the march there, the Swedish cavalry encountered a force of 3 banners of cossack style cavalry who were escorting the Lithuanian baggage and artillery train which had been left behind at Laudon. A fierce action followed in which the \\"cossacks\\" fought with great bravery, though losing some 70 men they were able to push their way through with the baggage train but had to leave the cannon behind due to the bad roads. Horn continued his operation and was able to take Berson but Laudon proved to strong from him which effectively ended the winter campaign of 1626-1627.

Only one individual has ever been documented. Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a new species in 1975 by David Harrison. The eponym for the species name \\"gallagheri\\" was Major Michael D. Gallagher, who collected the holotype. Its distinct morphology has called into question whether it represents its own genus of bat. Description The interaural membrane in the northern free-tailed bat (dorsal view) Male Chapin's free-tailed bat displaying its interaural crest Its fur is umber in color, with the belly paler than its back. The fur is short, with individual hairs only long. Its flight membranes are grayish- black. It is a small free-tailed bat, with a forearm length of . Its total length is ; its ear length is ; its tail is long; its hind foot is long. Its greatest length of skull is . Its ears are large and conjoined via the interaural membrane. The interaural membrane has a deep, backwards-facing pocket containing an interaural crest with hairs approximately in length. The bat is likely able to evert this pocket to display the crest. It is unique in its family due to the presence of large, paired \\"nasal inflations\\" similar to those found in the mouse-tailed bats. Like other free-tailed bats, its tail extends beyond the margin of the uropatagium. It has a blunt snout. Its wings are long and narrow. Biology and ecology As only one individual--a male-- has been documented, little is known about its biology and ecology. Based on other members of its genus, it is hypothesized that Gallagher's free-tailed bat forages for insects at relatively high altitudes with a fast but not maneuverable flight. Range and habitat The holotype was collected in the Scierie Forest, approximately southwest of Kindu, Democratic Republic of the Congo. It was captured in a mist net that was placed in the evergreen undergrowth of a partly-deciduous forest. The forest where the holotype was collected has been heavily logged. It is nocturnal, possibly roosting in hollow trees, rock crevices, or caves during the day. Conservation It is currently evaluated as data deficient by the IUCN, meaning that not enough information is available to assess its conservation needs. From 1996-2008, it was considered critically endangered, the most dire assessment category. This species is known from only one individual ever documented--the holotype. Threats to this species are unclear, but possibly include habitat destruction.

The Swedes were commanded by Herman Wrangel, and the Poles by Stanis≈Çaw Rewera Potocki. The battle ended with a victory for Sweden, who forced the entrenched Polish army out of their positions and retreat. Prelude During the beginning of the year 1629, the Swedish commander Herman Wrangel started his march against Strasburg an der Drewenz, to reinforce the stronghold which had been sieged by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. During his march he encountered the Polish army by the village of G√≥rzno, and the two forces went into battle formations on each side of the river Brynica (Printzel). The Swedish army started to cross the river on 12 February, without any notable resistance. This was however, mainly due to the Polish commander Stanis≈Çaw Rewera Potocki who wanted the whole Swedish force to get over before commencing attack; in order to handle a devastating defeat on the Swedes. Battle While having crossed the river, the Swedes had to march over another passing of Ruda to reach the Polish established frontlines. Wrangel decided the march to be done in column formation, hence fearing Polish cavalry assaults which could, in that case, inflict heavy casualties to the Swedes. Wrangel then started his march while having discovered the terrain to have been in Polish disadvantage if they intended to charge; the rough ground would make it hard for cavalry to act and a charge would most likely result in a failure. The Polish infantry whom guarded the crossing were after some fighting beaten, and shattered they ran against the remaining Polish lines. The Swedes could then get over with no greater difficulties. Wrangel then established battle formations and ordered Maximilian Teuffel with his force of German reiters and musketeers to capture the village of Zaborowo ‚Äì on the Swedish right respective Polish left flank. On his way there, the village was already set on fire by the Polish cavalry who were in full retreat. However, the dispersed Poles suddenly reversed their rout and charged the Swedish squadrons by the flaming village, and a fierce fighting took place. The fighting surged back and forth, It was set; this was going to be the major achievement for the day of battle. The German reiters on the Polish side soon retreated, but the Polish hussars made a courageous defense. Finally the Poles retreated as well and the left Polish flank was now opened for Swedish cavalry to assault their center. Thus, knowing they had enemies on their flank the Poles started wavering and got in disorder. The Swedes then took the initiative and after repeatedly charges, they managed to completely overrun the Polish center both from rear and frontal assaults. The Polish bulk was then shattered and the battle went into the percucating stage, where the Poles sustained heavy losses. Aftermath The Swedish morale and organization were widely reported, after the depiction of the battle for having forced the Poles out of their advantageous position. This caused setbacks for the Poles in their negotiations for peace in the war. The Poles estimated their numbers of missing soldiers to about 3,000 after the battle, the Swedes reported about 1,500 being killed and another 500 captured.Sveriges historia under Gustaf II Adolphs Regering, Volym 2, Abraham Peter Cronholm. p. 462 The Swedish casualties were lighter with only 30 dead and about 60 wounded. And on 3 February the Swedish commander Wrangel marched into the captured town of Strassburg.

Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given. Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter. Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given. There are commercial solutions such as Pedialyte, and relief agencies such as UNICEF widely distribute packets of salts and sugar. The World Health Organization (WHO) describes a homemade ORS with one liter water with one teaspoon salt (or 3 grams) and six teaspoons sugar (or 18 grams) added (approximately the ‚Äútaste of tears‚Äù).A GUIDE ON SAFE FOOD FOR TRAVELLERS, WELCOME TO SOUTH AFRICA, HOST TO THE 2010 FIFA WORLD CUP (bottom left of page 1). The WHO; however, does not generally recommend homemade solutions as how to make them is easily forgotten. Rehydration Project recommends adding the same amount of sugar but only one-half a teaspoon of salt, stating that this more dilute approach is less risky with very little loss of effectiveness.Rehydration Project, http://rehydrate.org/Homemade Oral Rehydration Solution Recipe. Both agree that drinks with too much sugar or salt can make dehydration worse. Medical uses =Medium dehydration= In what the World Health Organization (WHO) terms \\"some dehydration,\\" the child or adult is restless and irritable, is thirsty, and will drink eagerly. WHO recommends that if there is vomiting, don‚Äôt stop, but do pause for 5‚Äì10 minutes and then restart at a slower pace. (Vomiting seldom prevents successful rehydration since most of the fluid is still absorbed. Plus, vomiting usually stops after the first one to four hours of rehydration.) With the older WHO solution, also give some clean water during rehydration. With the newer reduced-osmolarity, more dilute solution, this is not necessary. Begin to offer food after the initial four-hour rehydration period with children and adults. With infants, continue to breastfeed even during rehydration as long as the infant will breastfeed. Begin zinc supplementation after initial four-hour rehydration to reduce severity and duration of episode. If available, zinc supplementation should be continued for 10 to 14 days. During the initial period of rehydration, the patient should be re- assessed at least every four hours. The family should be provided with at least two days worth of ORS packets. WHO recommends, in addition to infants continued to be breastfed, that children older than six months be given some food before being sent home, which helps to emphasize to parents the importance of continuing to feed the child during diarrhea. =Severe dehydration= In severe dehydration, the person may be lethargic or unconscious, drinks poorly, or may not be able to drink.The Treatment Of Diarrhea, A manual for physicians and other senior health workers, World Health Organization, 2005. See ‚Äú4.2 Treatment Plan A: home therapy to prevent dehydration and malnutrition,‚Äù ‚Äú4.3 Treatment Plan B: oral rehydration therapy for children with some dehydration,‚Äù and ‚Äú4.4 Treatment Plan C: for patients with severe dehydration‚Äù on pages 8 to 16 (12 -20 in PDF). See also ‚Äú8. MANAGEMENT OF DIARRHOEA WITH SEVERE MALNUTRITION‚Äù on pages 22-24 (26-30 in PDF) and ‚ÄúANNEX 2: ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS REHYDRATION SOLUTIONS‚Äù on pages 33-37 (37-41 in PDF). In malnourished persons, rehydration should be performed relatively slowly by drinking or by nasogastric tube unless the person is also suffering from shock in which case it should be performed quicker. Malnourished patients should receive a modified ORS which has less sodium, more potassium, and modestly more sugar. For patients not malnourished, rehydration should be performed relatively rapidly by means of intravenous (IV) solution. For infants under one year of age, WHO recommends giving, within the first hour, 30 milliliters of Ringer‚Äôs Lactate Solution for each kilogram of body weight, and then, within the next five hours, 70 milliliters of Ringer‚Äôs Lactate per kilogram of body weight. For children over one year and for adults, WHO recommends, within the first half hour, 30 milliliters of Ringer‚Äôs Lactate per kilogram of body weight, and then, within the next two- and-a-half hours, 70 milliliters per kilogram. For example, if a child weighs fifteen kilograms (who is obviously over one year of age), he or she should receive 450 ml of Ringer's Lactate Solution within the first half hour, and then 1,050 ml of Ringer's Lactate within the next two-and-a-half hours. Patients who can drink, even poorly, should be given Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) by mouth until the IV drip is running. In addition, all patients should start to receive some ORS when they are able to drink without difficulty, which is usually three to four hours for infants and one to two hours for older persons. ORS provides additional base and potassium which may not be adequately supplied by IV fluid. Ideally, patients should be reassessed every fifteen to thirty minutes until a strong radial pulse is present, and thereafter, assessed at least hourly to confirm that hydration is improving. Hopefully, patients will graduate to the medium dehydration or \\"some\\" dehydration category and receive continued treatment as above. Inadequate replacement of potassium losses during diarrhea can lead to potassium depletion and hypokalaemia (low serum potassium) especially in children with malnutrition. This can potentially cause muscle weakness, impaired kidney function, and cardiac arrhythmia. Hypokalaemia is worsened when base is given to treat acidosis without simultaneously providing potassium, as happens in standard IVs including Ringer's Lactate Solution. ORS can help correct potassium deficit, as can giving foods rich in potassium during diarrhea and after it has stopped. As in above sections, for all patients, supplemental zinc can help to reduce the severity and duration of diarrhea. In addition, supplemental vitamin A is often recommended, particular for children who have diarrhea during or shortly after measles, or in children who are already malnourished, although ideally for all patients. Contraindications Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended as the main source of hydration, or for children under 5 years of age as they may increase diarrhea. Plain water may be used if more specific and effective ORT preparations of hydrational fluids are unavailable or are not palatable. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted. Preparation Appropriate amounts of supplemental zinc and potassium should be added if available. But the availability of these should not delay rehydration. As WHO points out, the most important thing is to begin preventing dehydration as early as possible. In another example of prompt ORS hopefully preventing dehydration, CDC recommends for the treatment of cholera continuing to give Oral Rehydration Solution during travel to medical treatment.Community Health Worker Training Materials for Cholera Prevention and Control , CDC, slides at back are dated 11/17/2010. Page 7 states \\" . . . Continue to breastfeed your baby if the baby has watery diarrhea, even when traveling to get treatment. Adults and older children should continue to eat frequently.\\" The approximate amount of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to be given over four hours can be obtained by multiplying 75 milliliters of solution by the child‚Äôs weight in kilograms. For example, a child who weighs 15 kilograms should be given approximately 1,125 ml of ORS over four hours. Of course, the exact amount depends on how dehydrated the child is. And in general, let the person drink as much as they wish. The person can drink a little faster at first and then relatively slowly. For babies, a dropper or syringe without the needle may be used. Toddlers under two should be offered a teaspoonful every 1‚Äì2 minutes. Older children and adults may take frequent sips. Procedure Vomiting often occurs during the first hour or two of treatment with ORS, especially if a child drinks the solution too quickly, but this seldom prevents successful rehydration since most of the fluid is still absorbed. WHO recommends that if a child vomits, to wait five or ten minutes and then start to give the solution again more slowly. Children WHO recommends a child with diarrhea continue to be fed. Continued feeding speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function. In contrast, children whose food is restricted, have diarrhea of longer duration and recover intestinal function more slowly. A child should also continue to be breastfed. And in the example of the treatment of cholera, CDC also recommends that persons continue to eat and children continue to be breastfed. If IV treatment is not available at the facility, WHO recommends sending the child to a nearby facility if it can be reached within 30 minutes and providing the mother with ORS to administer to the child during the trip. If another facility is not available, ORS can be given by mouth as the child can drink and/or by nasogastric tube. WHO states that knowing the levels of serum electrolytes rarely changes the recommended treatment of children with diarrhea and dehydration, and furthermore, that these values are often misinterpreted. Most electrolyte imbalances are adequately treated by ORS. For example, a child who has been given an excess of sugar or salt like that which is in commercial soft drinks, sugared fruit drinks, or over-concentrated infant formula, may develop hypernatraemic dehydration. This occurs when these over-concentrated solutions sit in the gut and draw water from the rest of the body, and the reduced fluids in the body's tissues then have a higher proportion of salt to fluid. Children with serum sodium greater 150 mmol/liter have thirst out of proportion to other signs of dehydration. There is a danger of convulsions which usually occur when serum sodium concentrations are greater than 165 mmol/liter. Less commonly, convulsions can also occur when serum sodium is less than 130 mmol/liter. Treatment with ORS can usually bring serum sodium concentrations back to normal within twenty-four hours. Children with diarrhea who drink mostly water or overly dilute drinks with too little salt may develop hyponatraemia (serum sodium less than 130 mmol/liter). This is especially common in children with shigellosis and in severely malnourished children with edema. ORS is safe and effective for nearly all children with hyponatraemia, an exception being children with edema for whom ORS provides too much sodium.

The name comes from combining the MX from Mail eXchange and the lo abbreviation for a loopback networking interface, and is an anti-spam technique that is growing in popularity with network administrators who manage a large number of unused legacy domain names. Overview MX records provide a resource for internet hosts to discover the designated SMTP service for a given domain. By pointing MX records for unused domains to localhost/127.0.0.1, any SMTP traffic to these domains is sent back to the originating host. Under normal circumstances, this is undesirable behavior. In the case of unused domains, particularly those that have been actively used and receive large amounts of spam, this practice places the system load on the originating server. This is desirable from multiple perspectives, as it decreases load on the target systems and networks, and motivates internet service providers to minimize the sending of spam through their systems. History MXlo was conceived by a lone network administrator for a large engineering corporation. As the company acquired and subsequently retired domain names, the MX records for these domains were pointed to localhost to minimize system load from unwanted traffic. As admins and other technical people described this practice to each other, it picked up the nickname MXlo. Practical Implications For systems and providers that transmit a large volume of spam, sufficient use of the MXlo practice can cause a self-inflicted DoS (denial of service) attack, motivating the affected provider to prevent the sending of spam through their systems. Implementation DJBDNS (tinydns) > @yourdomain.tld::localhost:10 BIND > yourdomain.tld. IN MX 10 localhost. Others > Refer to your software documentation/manual Seeding A practice that has grown with the MXlo concept is seeding. Once MXlo has been implemented for a given domain, and if there is no intention to use the domain anymore, some administrators seed spam lists by publishing fake e-mail addresses associated with the target domain in public forums‚Äîblogs, wiki sites, etc.‚Äîand entering them in web forms that spammers are known to harvest e-mail addresses from. This technique intentionally creates unnecessary traffic for high volume spam hosts and increases their operating costs‚Äîand, in some cases, assists the aforementioned self-inflicted DoS attacks.

Founded by Leo Skidmore in 1959, the company began as an illustration studio for the automotive industry. Today, Skidmore Studio provides branding and design services to a range of consumer packaged goods companies and cultural institutions. The studio employs approximately 16 employees, including graphic designers, illustrators, copywriters, producers, and strategists.  History  Skidmore Studio was established in 1959 as an automotive illustration studio. The studio built a reputation in the 1950s and 60s for illustration work completed for Ford, General Motors and Chrysler. Until the mid 1970s, the studio worked exclusively on automotive advertising with local and national advertising agencies such as Campbell Ewald, Leo Burnett Worldwide, McCann Worldwide, Team Detroit and Doner. At the time, Skidmore employed many notable illustrators in addition to Leo Skidmore including Ed Fella, Ron Alexander, John Ball, Ann Bauer, Stephen Magsig, Scott Olds and Bryan Stolzenburg. In the early 1990s, Leo Skidmore‚Äôs daughter Mae Skidmore assumed ownership of the studio. With then Vice President Tim Smith, Skidmore expanded the studio‚Äôs offering and client base to include corporate clients such as the Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit Symphony Orchestra and Detroit Medical Center. In 2010, then-president Tim Smith, acquired majority interest of the studio and became CEO. In 2011, the studio relocated from Royal Oak, Michigan to downtown Detroit, furthering the city's resurgence of the creative class. Skidmore Studio now resides as the anchor tenant of the historic Madison Theatre Building, an entrepreneurial hub for creative and tech companies. The studio occupies the entire fourth floor of the Madison, taking up 9,800 square feet. It was purchased in November 2010 by Dan Gilbert, Chairman and Founder of Quicken Loans as part of his Detroit real estate initiatives. Skidmore Studio was the first official tenant of Gilbert‚Äôs real estate development firm, Bedrock. In January 2018, then-owner Tim Smith passed away suddenly. The studio was left to his wife and partner, Colleen Smith. In October 2018, Drew Patrick, previously the company‚Äôs CFO and president, purchased the studio from Smith. = Project history = During the 1950s and 1960s, the studio was respected as one of the country's most talented automotive illustration studios. Notable advertising campaigns from that period included work for: * Ford * Pontiac * Detroit Diesel * Buick * Lincoln * Dodge * Mercury In the 1970s and 1980s, Skidmore continued developing national advertising campaigns for a wider clientele that included: * McDonald's * Portland Cement Association * Reynold's Aluminum * Key Video In the 1990s and 2000s, Skidmore transitioned to a direct-to-client model with a renewed focus on the local market for clients like: * Ski-Doo * Detroit Institute of Arts * Detroit Symphony Orchestra In the 2010s, Skidmore further specialized in branding and identity, with a focus on the food and entertainment industries both locally and nationally.

His last completed work, it was first exhibited at the Salon des Ind√©pendants from 18 March to 1 May 1910, a few months before his death on 2 September 1910. Rousseau's earlier works had received a negative reception, but poet and critic Guillaume Apollinaire remarked on its debut: \\"The picture radiates beauty, that is indisputable. I believe nobody will laugh this year.\\" The Dream is the largest of the jungle paintings, measuring 6' 8¬Ω\\" √ó 9' 9¬Ω\\" (204.5 √ó 298.5 cm). It features an almost surreal portrait of Yadwigha (Jadwiga), Rousseau's Polish mistress from his youth, lying naked on a divan to the left of the painting, gazing over a landscape of lush jungle foliage, including lotus flowers, and animals including birds, monkeys, an elephant, a lion and lioness, and a snake. The stylised forms of the jungle plants are based on Rousseau's observations at the Paris Museum of Natural History and its Jardin des Plantes. The nude's left arm reaches towards the lions and a black snake charmer who faces the viewer playing his flute, barely visible in the gloom of the jungle under the dim light of the full moon. A pink-bellied snake slithers through the undergrowth, its sinuous form reflecting the curves of the woman's hips and leg. Suspecting that some viewers did not understand the painting, Rousseau wrote a poem to accompany it, Inscription pour La R√™ve: One possible interpretation of the painting, offered by Rousseau in a letter to art critic Andr√© Dupont, is that it depicts a woman reclining on a couch in Paris, dreaming she is listening to a flute player in the jungle. The subject of a reclining nude draws from a classical tradition, from Titian‚Äôs 1538 painting Venus of Urbino to Manet's 1863 painting Olympia. Rousseau may have taken some inspiration from √âmile Zola's novel Le R√™ve, which deals with the love between a painter and an embroideress. While he was painting The Dream, Rousseau was romantically involved with a shop assistant, Leonie. French art dealer Ambroise Vollard bought the painting from Rousseau in February 1910. It was sold through Knoedler Galleries in New York to clothing manufacturer and art collector Sidney Janis in January 1934. Janis sold the painting to Nelson A. Rockefeller in 1954, who donated it to the Museum of Modern Art, New York to celebrate the Museum's 25th anniversary. It remains on display at MoMA.

An accountant as a young man, his means were such that he was able to pursue his interests as a naturalist and antiquarian. He was a member of a number of societies, often assuming leadership positions. Hudd is perhaps best known for his roles as author of Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of the Bristol District, editor of the Proceedings of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, supervisor of the excavations undertaken by the Caerwent Exploration Fund, and author of \\"Richard Ameryk and the name America.\\" Background Alfred Edmund Hudd, son of leather merchant Samuel Hudd and his wife Mary Ann, was born in the second quarter of 1846 in Clifton. An accountant, he married Catharine Bowles Edmonds in the first quarter of 1872, their marriage recorded in the registration district of Faringdon, Berkshire. In 1881, Alfred and his wife resided at Clinton House on Pembroke Road in Clifton. Naturalist By 1870, Hudd was a member of the Bristol Naturalists' Society, which had been founded in 1862. He was first appointed to the Council of the society on 6 May 1875, and remained a member of the Council for years, until about 1892. After a hiatus as a Council member for several years, Hudd was reappointed to the Council in 1899, where he remained until at least 1901. He specialised in entomology. His Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of the Bristol District was published in six parts in the Proceedings of the Bristol Naturalists' Society: * Parts I and 2 appeared in Volume 2 of the Proceedings of the Bristol Naturalists' Society, published in 1879. * Parts 3, 4, and 5 appeared in Volume 3 of the Proceedings of the Bristol Naturalists' Society, published in 1882. * Part 6 appeared in Volume 4 of the Proceedings of the Bristol Naturalists' Society, published in 1885. Hudd was also a Fellow of the Entomological Society of London, founded in 1833, and now known as the Royal Entomological Society of London. In 1912, he presented his collection of 1300 coleoptera (beetle) specimens to the Bristol Museum and Library, now the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, to supplement the Stephen Barton (d. 1898) collection. His collection of lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) specimens was added to the George C. Griffiths (1852‚Äì1924) collection at the Bristol Museum. Hudd also contributed a short chapter on \\"The Insects of the Bristol District\\" to the Handbook to Bristol and the neighbourhood. Antiquarian Hudd was elected secretary of the Clifton Antiquarian Club at its first meeting on 23 January 1884 at the Bristol Museum and Library. He retained that position during all twenty-eight years of the original society. Not only a founding member of the club, Alfred Edmund Hudd had the distinction of being the only member of the Clifton Antiquarian Club to remain with the original organisation from its inception in 1884 to its end in 1912. He served as editor of the society's seven volumes of Proceedings, also contributing 21 papers. His service to the organisation was acknowledged on 5 January 1898 when the club presented him with a silver bowl and a set of four silver candlesticks. In 1911, the membership of the club again paid tribute to his efforts, with an inscribed, inlaid grandfather clock. Alfred Hudd was a member of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society, and served on its Council. On 9 August 1904, he was elected to membership of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland at a meeting of that organisation held at Tuam, County Galway. In addition, he was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. Caerwent Exploration Fund Excavations at Caerwent in south Wales Alfred Hudd was closely involved with the Caerwent Exploration Fund. At a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of London in February 1899, Alfred Trice Martin, also a founding member of the Clifton Antiquarian Club and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, suggested that a systematic excavation of Caerwent, a Roman town in south Wales, be undertaken. The Caerwent Exploration Fund was established by the Clifton Antiquarian Club soon thereafter. In September 1899, at Caerwent, Godfrey Morgan, Lord Tredegar, was elected President of the Caerwent Exploration Fund and Alfred Hudd was elected Treasurer. Hudd and Thomas Ashby, Junior, both members of the Executive Committee of the Fund, supervised the excavations at Caerwent. During the period between 1899 and 1913, two-thirds of the Roman town in south Wales was revealed. The archive of Caerwent, which was discovered during the excavations by the Fund, is in the archaeology collection of Newport Museum. The reports on the excavations at Caerwent were published in Archaeologia, the journal of the Society of Antiquaries of London. Much of the success of the Caerwent Exploration Fund has been attributed to Alfred Hudd. The naming of America Johannes Stradanus (1523‚Äì1605). \\"Americus rediscovers America. He called her but once and thenceforth she was always awake.\\" The traditional theory of the naming of America is that it was named in honour of Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian navigator. At the turn of the sixteenth century, Vespucci undertook a series of voyages (the number of which remains unresolved) in search of a western passage to the Indies. After the voyage of 1501‚Äì1502, he proposed that the areas that he and, separately, Christopher Columbus had explored were not part of Asia, but rather a New World. America first received its name in the Cosmographiae Introductio, published by cartographer Martin Waldseem√ºller in 1507. Vespucci's published letters (the authenticity of which is contested) were the inspiration for that work, which was authored by a group of scholars in Saint-Di√©, Lorraine, France. They revised Ptolemy's Geography to include the New World and reasoned that, as the three previously known continents, Europe, Asia, and Africa, had feminine names, so should the New World. Accordingly, the feminised version of the Latin form of the baptismal name of the \\"discoverer\\" of the New World, Vespucci, was utilised. The appendix of the book included Waldseem√ºller's map of the world in which the New World was labelled \\"America.\\" The map, rediscovered in a German castle in 1901, was the first to use the name America and the first to depict a Western Hemisphere. The Library of Congress purchased the 1507 Waldseem√ºller map in 2003. On 30 April 2007, German Chancellor Angela Merkel transferred the map, also known as America's \\"birth certificate,\\" to the people of the United States in a ceremony at the Library of Congress. There are several alternate theories of the naming of America. Alfred Hudd proposed his theory in a paper which was read at 21 May 1908 meeting of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, and which appeared in Volume 7 of the club's Proceedings. In \\"Richard Ameryk and the name America,\\" Hudd discussed the 1497 discovery of North America by John Cabot, an Italian who had sailed on behalf of England. Upon his return to England after his first (1497) and second (1498‚Äì1499) voyages, Cabot received two pension payments from King Henry VII. Of the two customs officials at the Port of Bristol who were responsible for handing over the money to Cabot, the more senior was Richard Ameryk (High Sheriff of Bristol in 1503). Hudd postulated that Cabot named the land that he had discovered after Ameryk, from whom he received the pension conferred by the king. He stated that Cabot had a reputation for being free with gifts to his friends, such that his expression of gratitude to the official would not be unexpected. Further, Hudd quoted a late 15th-century manuscript (a calendar of Bristol events), the original of which had been lost in an 1860 Bristol fire, that indicated the name America was already known in Bristol in 1497. Hudd reasoned that the scholars of the 1507 Cosmographiae Introductio, unfamiliar with Richard Ameryk, assumed that the name America, which he claimed had been in use for ten years, was based on Amerigo Vespucci and, therefore, mistakenly transferred the honour from Ameryk to Vespucci. While Hudd's speculation has found support from more than one 21st century author, there is no hard proof to substantiate his theory that Cabot named America after Richard Ameryk. Later life Hudd's first wife Kate died on 4 April 1889 and was buried in the Old Protestant Cemetery in Naples, Italy. Hudd married Adeline Sophia Tyzack in the fourth quarter of 1891 in the registration district of Kensington, London. In 1901, he resided at 94 Pembroke Road in Clifton with his second wife Adeline and two daughters. Alfred Edmund Hudd of 108 Pembroke Road in Clifton died on 7 October 1920, his death registered in Bristol in the fourth quarter of the year. His estate of almost ¬£16,000 went to probate on 17 December 1920. His wife survived him.

The Long Point Light was built on this point in 1827. The lighthouse once shared this peninsula with a settlement of fishermen that came to be known as Long Point, Massachusetts. This Provincetown village grew and thrived from 1818 until the late 1850s. When the settlers decided to leave Long Point, they took most of their houses with them ‚Äì about 30 structures in all ‚Äì by floating them across the harbor. During the American Civil War, the military established a defensive coastal artillery post and garrison at this location. The Long Point Battery came to be known as \\"Fort Useless\\" and \\"Fort Ridiculous\\" among the local residents. Today, Long Point is a ghost village ‚Äì nothing remains, except for the lighthouse and an earthen mound, the last remnant from the earlier military post. Early history A fisherman named John Atwood built the first house on Long Point in 1818. He was followed by Prince Freeman, and next by Eldridge Smith. Others soon followed in increasing numbers, and in 1822, Prince Freeman, Jr. became the first child born on \\"The Point\\", as it was called by the locals. The initial lure that attracted so many fishermen to this area was its proximity to prime fishing grounds, and the amount of fish that could be caught from the shore. Using sweep seines (that were hand-knit by their wives), fishermen caught an abundance of mackerel, shad and bass from shore. There are reports of up to seventy-five barrels of white shad caught in one haul, fetching $16 per barrel ‚Äì accounting for inflation, that single haul netted roughly $ in today's dollars. By an act of Congress on May 18, 1826, the government earmarked $2,500 (roughly $ today) to acquire four acres at the extreme tip of the point, and to construct a lighthouse, which was completed in 1827. By 1830, the lighthouse became the site of Long Point's first school, starting with only three children. The Long Point community continued to grow, and by 1846, the Town of Provincetown voted to build a schoolhouse on Long Point. By then, the village was home to 38 fishing families, with nearly 200 adults and 60 children. In describing the experience of living on Long Point in the early 1800s, one author wrote: By 1836, Long Point had 34 buildings, plus 9 windmills for several saltworks. Stereoscopic view of a 19th-Century windmill, just one of the dozens that once dotted Provincetown's shoreline The village had its own post office, a bakery, boat landings for 20 cod-fishing vessels, breakwaters, and several saltworks with nine windmills that were used to pump seawater into about of drying pans. With low costs and an endless supply of raw materials, the collection of sea salt was extremely profitable in the first part of the 19th century. Not only was salt shipped out for domestic consumption, but it was also used to supply the fishing industry, which dried and salted the catch to preserve the fish for shipment. The annual output of the saltworks on Long Point reached \\"five to six hundred hogsheads\\", or , \\"of extra quality salt.\\" That represented just under 10% of Provincetown's total annual salt production of . Challenges Production of salt did not retain its lucrative luster for long, however, for downward price pressures had hit that industry from several angles. For one, the completion of the Erie Canal in 1830 meant a sharp increase in competition from companies that were mining massive salt deposits in Syracuse, New York. Local competition had increased as well ‚Äì by 1837, Provincetown had 78 saltworks, and the selling price had fallen from a high of eight dollars per bushel at the turn of the nineteenth century, down to only one dollar. Around that same time, demand for salt-cured fish began to decline, yielding to a growing consumer preference for ice harvesting and storage. John Atwood Jr., the son of Long Point's founder, boasted that \\"In 1848 I brought the first mackerel ever received on ice to Boston. It was August. I took them in the sloop smack American Eagle.\\" He later pioneered the use of a jib topsail to shorten his time-to-market, so as to meet the growing appetite for fresh- caught fish. The East Harbor isolated Provincetown from other towns (top), until the railroad arrived in 1873 Living on Long Point presented its own share of challenges as well. The geography of Provincetown as a whole made for an isolating existence throughout most of its history, as the town was essentially cut off, not just from the mainland, but in many ways, even from neighboring towns on Cape Cod. The town was surrounded by water in every direction: :* Atlantic Ocean, to the north :* Massachusetts Bay to the northwest :* Cape Cod Bay to the west and southwest :* Provincetown Harbor to the south and southeast :* East Harbor and a salt marsh to the east Until late in the 19th century, there was not a single road leading in or out of Provincetown ‚Äì the only way to travel by land to the rest of Cape Cod was to first head north, traversing a series of tall, rolling sand dunes, and to then follow the thin strip of beach along the northern shore line, known as the \\"backshore\\". A wooden bridge was erected over the East Harbor in 1854, only to be destroyed by a winter storm and ice two years later. Although the bridge was replaced the following year, a traveler using it still had to traverse several miles over a sand route, which, together with the backshore route, would occasionally be washed out by storms. Prior to the railroad's arrival in 1873, Provincetown was like an island, in that it relied almost entirely upon the sea for its communication, travel, and commerce needs. All of this was doubly true of Long Point, being isolated from its own nearest neighbor, the rest of the town of Provincetown. To reach the closest edge of town from Long Point by land, one had to make a difficult trek across a beach route past Wood End to Herring Cove, and then another mile () over continuously shifting sand dunes. To complicate matters, portions of that route were underwater twice each day with the high tide. Although salt was plentiful, there was no source of fresh water on Long Point. Plank cisterns were built throughout the village to collect and store rain water for daily use. During periods of drought, barrels of water had to be filled up in Provincetown, and then transported over to the point. Beyond the challenges imposed by the occasional drought, however, the residents of Long Point came to recognize the potential for a much greater natural force ‚Äì one that threatened to impact them with little advance warning. While Long Point provides a natural barrier to protect Provincetown and its harbor from many storm hazards, the point bears the brunt of such a storm when it does so: Plaque that identifies \\"floater houses\\", those that were floated across the harbor Moving Sources differ and remain unclear as to the specific reasons for leaving Long Point; it is also unclear whether there was a triggering event which caused a wholesale departure, or whether there was instead a more orderly migration. Sources all agree, however, that beginning in the 1850s, families began to leave Long Point and return to the main town. Most of the families took their houses with them when they left Long Point ‚Äì the local Deacon's specialty was moving buildings, and the houses, about 30 in all, were placed on rafts and floated across Provincetown Harbor to the town's West End. \\"They say that so gently were these houses eased off that the moving didn't interfere with the housewife cooking her dinner,\\" wrote Mary Heaton Vorse. By the time of the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), only two houses were left on Long Point. A 1942 article in the Cape Cod Standard Times tells the following variation of the story: This house floated from Long Point to the West End in the 1850s; shown here in 1890 moving yet again, to the East End. Many of those historic \\"floater homes\\", as they came to be called, are still standing in Provincetown's West End, and can be identified by a distinctive blue and white plaque that indicates the home's historic journey. The schoolhouse was among the last buildings to leave Long Point; it was moved to Commercial Street in the center of town.  Long Point Battery  During the War of 1812, the British navy had controlled Provincetown Harbor. Seeking to correct the lack of fortifications, the U.S. Army surveyed the harbor from 1833‚Äì1835, and noted that \\"the point had a large civilian population\\". The Army returned to build the planned Long Point Battery during the American Civil War. Army documents state that: Long Point Battery, circa 1865. US Army Corps of Engineers. The batteries were designed by and built under the supervision of Major Charles E. Blunt of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The Army, however, did not actually \\"construct\\" the officer's quarters ‚Äì instead, the company's three officers were headquartered in the last remaining house from the earlier village. On March 5, 1864, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ceded \\"an indefinite area (approximately 150 acres)\\" of Long Point to the United States Government. The new barracks housed a company of 98 enlisted soldiers from the Unattached Companies of Massachusetts Volunteer Militia. The 12th Unattached Company, which had been detached from an existing regiment of the Massachusetts Militia, at first served a 90-day tour of duty at the post from May through August 1864. Most of the men reenlisted for another 100-day tour, this time as the 21st Unattached Company from August through November. In November 1864, they enlisted once again for a full year, but they were mustered out at the end of June 1865, as the war had come to an end. The enlisted barracks was floated across the harbor postwar, and still exists as 473 Commercial Street in Provincetown. The batteries on Long Point remained operational until the post was abandoned in 1872, but they were never used in combat. In the years following the war, the people of Provincetown, aware that they were protected against an enemy that would never materialize, soon labelled the batteries \\"Fort Useless\\" and \\"Fort Ridiculous\\". The earthworks of the batteries remain, eroded down to sand dunes.  Late 19th century to present  Cape Cod Oil Works, 1891. An old ship hull was the fertilizer screening room. Breakwater, built in 1911. Wood End Light on horizon (above man's head); Long Point Light is to the left (not shown) In 1873, a lighthouse inspection revealed that the original wooden light ‚Äì whose unique architectural design came to be known as a \\"Cape Cod style lighthouse\\" ‚Äì had deteriorated to such a poor condition that it might be destroyed by a strong storm. In 1875, that light was replaced with the brick tower that stands today. Even though the Army had moved out, they retained title to the land. Nevertheless, at around the same time that the lighthouse was rebuilt, the Cape Cod Oil Works built a cod fish oil and whale oil factory in the area that had been the barracks. As the land was still a military reservation, the Army tried to have the factory removed a number of times in the ensuing years. Records from this period are scarce, but Army archives indicate that the factory was still operating in the middle of 1883 ‚Äì another source from 1890 states that \\"John Atwood built a wharf on the north side of the point, which is standing to-day, used by the Cape Cod Oil Works, the only buildings now left excepting the lighthouse.\\" The exact date of the factory's closing is unknown, but official Army correspondence in 1917 makes no mention of it. The only known photograph of the factory, taken in 1891 and retrieved from the National Archives and Records Administration is inscribed with the words \\"Condemned ... 1919\\". Long Point, as viewed from downtown, 2012 An oil house was built in 1904, in order to properly store the flammable materials used to illuminate the light. Aside from the lighthouse and the oil house, no other structure has survived to the present day. The mound of earth that formed the foundation of the outer battery appears as none other than a sand dune With photos. ‚Äì no other hint of the early settlement, the military post, nor the oil factory can be found on Long Point today. One cultural artifact that is now visible atop the earthworks of the outer battery is a cross that honors the memory of Staff Sgt. Charles Darby ‚Äì \\"an unsung soldier who loved the dunes\\". Darby was killed in action over the Netherlands in 1944.  Village detail, 1857  The image below shows the layout of the houses, stores and saltworks on Long Point as they existed in 1857.

Shahzada Mirza Jawan Bakht Bahadur (Persian, ) alternative spelling Mirza Javan Bakht, Mirza Jewan Bakht also known as Mirza Jahandar Shah (A.D. 1749 - 31 May 1788 A.D., 25th Shaban 1202 A.H.,) born at the Red Fort, Delhi. He was the eldest son of Emperor Shah Alam II and the grandson of Emperor Alamgir II, Jawan Bakht was a very influential Timurid Prince of the Mughal Empire. Early life Prince Mirza Jawan Bakht grew up during very turbulent times in the Mughal Empire, his grandfather's relations with the Maratha backed Grand Vizier Imad-ul-Mulk had begun to worsen as the imperial Nawabs sought to re-centralize the empire. The Vizier Imad-ul-Mulk was clearly a man of no principles and was commonly criticized for his extreme selfishness. He put all the imperial revenues into his own pocket and starved the Alamgir II's family for three days because Timur Shah Durrani had become the son-in-law of the emperor. Mirza Jawan Bakht often recalled the days he wandered around Delhi begging for food supplies and firewood during those three days. Angered by the disrespect and arrogance exhibited by Imad-ul-Mulk, Ahmad Shah Durrani set out on another invasion and appointed Najib-ud-Daula as the new Grand Vizier of the Mughal Empire in accordance to the wishes of Alamgir II and Shah Waliullah. Ahmad Shah Durrani then returned to Kabul, while the experienced Najib-ud-Daula consolidated the remains of the Mughal Empire by uniting distant Faujdars, Nawab's and Nizams into a common cause against the Marathas. Mirza Jawan Bakht was among the Mughal Princes in the service of Najib-ul-Daula, and received military training from his new mentor Hafiz Rahmat Khan. Fearing the wrath of Ahmad Shah Durrani's new coalition the deposed Imad-ul-Mulk consolidated himself with an old ally the Maratha leader Sadashivrao Bhau and launched a ferocious attack which lasted 15 days and caused the defeat of Najib-ud-Daula and the Mughal Army in the imperial heartlands around Delhi. Najib-ud-Daula conceded defeat and ordered his forces to retreat northwards after being completely overrun. Things got a lot worse when Imad-ul-Mulk persecuted Mirza Jawan Bakht's activist father Prince Ali Gauhar. When Ali Gauhar realized that Imad- ul-Mulk was planning to have him assassinated he fled eastwards and sought refuge with Ahmad Shah Bangash and Shuja-ud-Daula the Nawab of Awadh. Imad-ul- Mulk then feared that the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II would recall Ahmad Shah Durrani, or use his son Prince Ali Gauhar, to dispossess him of his newfound power with the Marathas. Therefore, Imad-ul-Mulk and Sadashivrao Bhau plotted to murder the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II and his family. In November, 1759, the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II was told that a pious man had come to meet him, Alamgir II, ever so eager to meet holy men, set out immediately to meet him at Kotla Fateh Shah, he was stabbed repeatedly by Imad-ul-Mulk's assassins. The Mughal Emperor Alamgir II's death was mourned throughout the Mughal Empire. Shah Jahan III the usurper After the assassination of Alamgir II in 1759, the Peshwa under the sway of Sadashivrao Bhau had reached the peak of its short-lived power particularly when their involvement in the assassination had become eminent when he discussed abolishing the Mughal Empire and placing Vishwasrao on the throne in Delhi by bribing or deposing Imad-ul-Mulk. However, Sadashivrao Bhau then personally chose Shah Jahan III as the new Mughal Emperor and began a campaign of plundering the Jewels and ornaments of the Mughal imperial court, he also defaced mosques, tombs and shrines that the Mughals had built in Agra and Delhi, he then desecrated the imperial Moti Masjid and looted its exquisite jeweled decorations into booty for the ravaging Marathas. Sadashivrao Bhau's domination over the Mughal Empire had a profound impact on the divided and degenerative Muslim aristocracy and hierarchy, many began to look up to Ahmad Shah Durrani as their savior. Mirza Jawan Bakht is known to have witnessed the looting and this event completely changed his opinion regarding the legitimacy and the immoral authoritarianism of the Maratha renegades. Third Battle of Panipat Prince Mirza Jawan Bakht coordinated and commanded various contingents of Mughal troopers, who cut off the supply lines of the Marathas prior to the Third Battle of Panipat and eventually overthrew the usurping Jahan Shah III after the victory of the coalition of Ahmad Shah Durrani and proclaimed Shah Alam II as the rightful ruler of the Mughal Empire Mirza Jawan Bakht regent of the Mughal Empire After the Battle of Buxar, Shah Alam II's absence from Delhi meant that his son Prince Mirza Jawan Bakht and Najib-ul-Daula, were the actual representatives of the emperor for the next 12 years. As the Administrator of Delhi and the imperial heartlands including Agra, Najib-ul-Daula, was unprepared to halt the Jat peasant uprisings led by the deviant Suraj Mal. During one massive assault Jat renegades and their leaders overran the Mughal garrison at Agra they plundered the city and the two great silver doors to the entrance of the famous Taj Mahal were looted and thoughtlessly melted down by Suraj Mal in 1764. Since then many Mughal Faujdars and commanders such as Sayyad Muhammad Khan Baloch vowed to avenge the ruins of the Mughal Empire caused by the tyrannical Jat's and during an ingenious counterattack Suraj Mal was defeated and executed by the Mughal Army. The Jats then sacked Jaipur and invited the Marathas in 1766, Ahmad Shah Abdali tried to reinforce Delhi by organizing another campaign against the Sikhs, who killed Zain Khan Sirhindi, the Sikh renegades were ultimately defeated by the Durrani forces. In the year 1768 the Marathas pillaged Bharatpur, and the Mughal Army began to crumble once again mainly due to the death of Najib-ul-Daula. Mirza Jawan Bakht and Hafiz Rahmat Khan never trusted Najib-ul-Daulas manipulative son Zabita Khan, who was often compared with the unpopular Imad-ul-Mulk. Arrival of Shah Alam II The Mughal Army of Shah Alam II arrives in Delhi. Soon after the emperor's arrival in Delhi, Zabita Khan began to align himself with Jat rebels and in response to this particular alliance Mirza Najaf Khan, Mirza Jawan Bakht and his armies attacked Zabita Khan, who fled from his position and the chief of the Rohillas, but was restored once again after negotiating peace with Shah Alam II. Zabita Khan caused even greater tribulations when he intentionally attacked and provoked the weakened Marathas, who then overran and set ablaze a large portion of Rohilkhand and captured Najafgarh. The Marathas were defeated soon after at Asadpur, when Hafiz Rahmat Khan successfully gained reinforcements by his longtime ally by Shuja-ud-Daula, together their combined forces expelled the Marathas out of Rohilkhand and Delhi also. =Mirza Jawan Bakht, champion of the new Mughal Army= A Mughal infantryman, under the command of Mirza Najaf Khan, well capable of defending the Mughal Empire. One of his first acts was to strengthen and raise a new Mughal Army, under the command of Mirza Najaf Khan capable of defending the Mughal Empire. This new army consisted of infantrymen who successfully utilized both Flintlocks and Talwars in combat formations, they utilized elephants for transportation and were less dependent on artillery and cavalry. Mirza Najaf Khan is also known to have introduced the more-effective Firelock muskets through his collaboration with Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal. The new Mughal Army carried the standard of Mirza Jawan Bakht, and soon controlled a vast territory that stretched from the Satluj Valley in the west to the territories around Allahabad in the east, from Srinagar in the north to Gwalior in the south, however times were troubled and the Mughal Empire was surrounded by enemies on every side. =Coup by Ghulam Qadir= After Prince Mirza Jawan Bakht's fruitless attempts to halt the eunuch Ghulam Qadir and his renegade forces, Ghulam Qadir with his renegade Sikh and Hindu allies entered the imperial palace and forced Shah Alam II to appoint him as the Grand Vizier of the Mughal Empire. Petty, avaricious and insane the eunuch ravaged the palaces in search of the Mughal treasure believed to be worth Rs 250 million. Unable to locate even a fraction of that sum and angered by the Mughal Emperor's attempts to eliminate him and his Sikh allies, Ghulam Qadir had Shah Alam II blinded on August 10, 1788. A drunken ruffian, Ghulam Qadir behaved with gross brutality to the emperor and his family. Three servants and two water-carriers who tried to help the bleeding emperor were beheaded and according to one account, Ghulam Qadir would pull the beard of the elderly Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II. After ten horrible weeks, during which Ghulam Qadir stripped the princesses of the royal family naked and forced them to dance naked before him (after which they jumped into Yamuna river to drown) and the honour of the royal family and prestige of the Mughal Empire reached its lowest ebb, Mahadaji Shinde intervened and killed Ghulam Qadir, taking possession of Delhi on 2 October 1788. Unable to gather any assistance from his cousin Zaman Shah Durrani and isolated by the subjects of Shah Alam II, Mirza Jawan Bakht refused to ally himself with the despised Maratha chieftain Mahadaji Shinde, the Mughal Prince suddenly died mortified in May 1788, while gathering relief forces in Agra.

It has also been called \\"Jianmenguan Pass\\"; however, that form is redundant since guan means \\"pass\\" in Chinese. Location Jianmen Pass is located in Jiange County, Guangyuan City of Sichuan Province. The city of Chengdu, which is the capital of Sichuan Province, is less than 200 kilometers south from there. The natural pass is formed by cliffs on the sides of mountains. The gate of the pass was built on the middle part of the Dajian Mountain as a strategic position. History Detailed view of various mountain ranges and passes between Shaanxi and Sichuan The mountain pass was a part of the Shu Roads. The construction of the gate was related to the Three Kingdoms era strategist, Shu Han chancellor Zhuge Liang. While Zhuge Liang repaired the gallery roads, he found the terrain in Jiange was a naturally perfect place to set up a defensive position for Shu; therefore, he ordered a military gate to be built on the pass. After Zhuge Liang died, his successor Jiang Wei led the army and held the Jianmen Pass against the invasion from Wei. Since then, Jianmen Pass has become a key position and most important pass in three routes into Sichuan. In 1932, because the local government was building a road across the Jianmen Pass, they demolished the structure which was built in the Ming Dynasty. Only the foundation was left. Later, during the Chinese Civil War, Jianmen Pass was taken by the Communists from the Nationalists. Jianmen Pass lost its military value but became a major tourist attraction because of its history. In the 1980s, the Chinese government rebuilt the old gate structure. The building was damaged by fire in 2005. The rebuilt gate was heavily damaged again by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.

Career  Sterler, who appeared in several Hollywood films, was once affiliated with the Burgtheater in Vienna. She debuted in 1918 at the Residenztheater Hannover and later performed in Berlin, where she appeared at the Kleinen Theater (\\"Little Theater\\"). She played a saloon lady and, from 1921, often appeared in German silent film. She flourished as a character actor in roles of young wives and mothers. In 1930 she appeared as Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna in Rasputin, Demon with Women. In 1933, a German government decree was enacted by Joseph Goebbels under the auspices of a newly created agency called Die Reichskulturkammer. The decree stipulated that Jewish actors were, among other things, prohibited from performing on German stage. Sterler, who was a Jew, relocated to Vienna in 1933, where she continued to work in theater and cinema. The Anschluss of Austria ended her artistic career there. Sterler next moved to London. In 1938, she immigrated to the United States from Zurich under her birth name Minna Stern. Film director Wilhelm Dieterle gave Sterler her first role in American cinema. During World War II and after, Sterler played mostly small roles in Hollywood productions portraying German or other European women. In the 1944 anti-Nazi film The Hitler Gang, she played the wife of Ernst Hanfstaengl. On November 10, 1944, Sterler became a United States naturalized citizen in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California at Los Angeles. She gave actress Piper Laurie private acting lessons when Laurie was a child. Hermine Sterler died on 25 May 1982 in Stuttgart.

The robbery was committed by brothers Michael Kent Poland and Patrick Gene Poland. Both brothers were eventually executed for their parts in the crime, becoming one of two sets of brothers executed in Arizona, the others being the LaGrands. The story was featured in episode 6, season 4 of The FBI Files on December 4, 2001.  Description of crime  On May 24, 1977, guards Russell Dempsey and Cecil Newkirk were on duty for Purolator Courier. They were driving along I-17 when a vehicle they believed was a police car pulled them over. After pulling over, they were ordered by the men they believed were police officers to open the truck, after which the Poland brothers took over. The drivers of the security van were bundled into bags and dumped into Lake Mead . The brothers had claimed that one guard had died of a heart attack, so they had to kill the other. They had stolen $228,000 during the robbery. Investigation The investigation first focused on the two missing couriers. Both were ruled out as suspects when their wives reported that they had no financial problems, and their employer reported that each of the couriers had faithfully worked for the company for over 20 years. The truck was eventually found in the remote desert near the town of Bumble Bee. Though the couriers were not there, blood was found in the back of the truck along with several thousand dollars in coins. The truck's doors were left locked until a spare set of keys were brought to unlock them. Upon examination it was discovered that the vehicle's radio was found to be left on but no distress calls were received by the base, also the van's siren had not been tripped and an unfired shotgun was found in the back. US$293,000 worth of paper currency was missing. After the discovery, the FBI had local news agencies make the news public. Several motorists called in reporting that they saw the van stopped on the northbound side of Interstate 17 on the morning of May 24, exactly the same date when the guards were reported missing. One motorist said he saw an Arizona Highway Patrol officer walking towards the van, and other witnesses had similar stories, but in their accounts the make and model of the trooper's car varied, while others claimed to have seen the police cruiser stopped in front of the armored van. After checking with the Arizona Highway Patrol, they learned that none of their officers remembered stopping an armored van on Interstate 17 on May 24, so the assumption was made that whoever that Arizona state trooper was, he was actually masquerading as one. Several motorists underwent hypnosis to provide details of that officer to a sketch artist but there were different results. Mojave County Sheriff's Deputy Dale Lent and FBI agents processed the spot where the armored car was believed to have been stopped. Digs and gouges in the dirt indicated that there had been a struggle near the rear of the van. In addition tire tracks from a second vehicle were found, consistent with the tire tracks found in the remote area near where the armored van had been abandoned however those same tracks were also found in front of where the van had been pulled over. On June 16, 1977, 300 miles northwest of where the armored van had been abandoned, a body in a black canvas bag was discovered in Debbie's Cove in Lake Mead by a pair of anglers. The men contacted the National Park Service who sped to the scene along with investigators and local officers. After recovering the body a wallet was found in the back pocket and the victim was identified as Russell Dempsey, one of the two missing courier guards. Continuing the search found no sign of the second courier, but two sticks of wood connected by a rope which, resembled a makeshift garrote, was found. A subsequent autopsy indicated that the guard found had suffered a heart attack and had been strangled, possibly with a garrote like the makeshift one found near the body, but it was not until a strand of hair found tangled in the device was confirmed to be from the deceased guard answered their suspicions. During the next few weeks, FBI agents canvassed area service stations until one station owner reported his suspicions. He had towed a pickup truck which had inadvertently backed into the lake, from a boat ramp named Bonelli Landing, at Lake Mead the day after the robbery for two men who claimed to be fishing. Though there did not seem to be any fishing equipment in the back, there were drag marks in the bed of the vehicle. The receipt for the towing had the signature of Michael Poland. An exhaustive search of boat rental receipts turned up one which had his name for a rental for a boat to Bonelli Landing, where the pickup had been towed. Agents returned to Lake Mead and after searching between Bonelli Landing and the boat rental shop across the shore, Cecil Newkirk's body was recovered, floating in a black canvas bag just like his partner. An autopsy conducted revealed that he had been severely beaten before being drowned and wounds on his chest were discovered to be consistent with the wounds left by a high- voltage taser gun. His personal effects had been removed including a self- winding watch which stopped working at 10:37 p.m on May 26. An intensified search yielded a 3rd canvas bag similar to the first few bags used to cover the courier guards' corpses, which contained two corroded revolvers, concrete dust caked in the weave of the bag and more crucially, a license plate similar to the ones used on Arizona Highway Patrol cruisers. The service station owner identified Michael Poland in a picture lineup. Investigators eventually located Michael Poland, and they observed that he did not appear gainfully employed, but he had recently purchased a new motorcycle. Investigators identified a man who frequently visited as Michael's younger brother, Patrick. He had just bought a new car. Michael's teenage son told them his father had recently bought two new motorcycles and a lot more. Further investigation revealed that both brothers were in financial trouble but after the robbery their debts had been paid completely and they had purchased new vehicles, spending money beyond their legal means. The Poland brothers' father said both brothers had borrowed the truck on the day of the robbery and that several weeks before the heist, Mr. Poland had mixed concrete in the pickup's flatbed, and examinations revealed it was the same batch of concrete that left the dust stuck in the canvas bag recovered at Lake Mead. However the station owner could not positively identify Patrick Poland, but he did confirm that their father's pickup truck was the one he towed from Bonelli Landing. On July 27, 1977, agents arrived at Michael Poland's house with a search warrant but he claimed that on the day of the heist he was in Las Vegas buying jewels. Several gems and $12,000 in cash were found and Michael claimed that they were for his jewel business. Several receipts were confiscated including a receipt for two taser guns sold one month before the robbery. However, when Patrick Poland was asked regarding the robbery he said they were at Lake Mead fishing but had difficulties answering other questions. His brother Michael later called him to tell him to not to talk to investigators. A search of Patrick's house yielded a stash of weapons and $16,000 in cash. After much investigation it was revealed that neither of the cars the brothers owned before the robbery left the tire tracks found near the crime scene. The clerk of the gun store which sold the tasers to Mark Harris could only remember Mark Harris as a white male in his 20s. 10 months of surveillance on the brothers revealed the brothers closing a deal on a gaming arcade but there was insufficient evidence for an arrest warrant so agents focused on determining where the black canvas bags came from. That paid off when one store owner recognised the bags as coming from his company and the special cord which came from a company in Georgia. The owner gave receipts he had left from years of business and after much searching, a receipt for three custom-sized black canvas bags was found to have been sold to Mark Harris, similar to the taser receipt found during a search of Michael Poland's home months earlier which convinced agents that Mark Harris was an alias for Michael Poland. Arrests On May 18, 1978, after nearly a year of investigation, a Federal Grand Jury returned an indictment against the Poland brothers for robbery, kidnapping and murder. However, FBI agents suspected that both brothers would not surrender quietly so they decided to arrest them away from their homes fearing a shootout. Michael Poland went to a real-estate office while Patrick went to the game arcade. When Patrick Poland reached the arcade the FBI arrest team tried to nab him before he entered. However he surrendered without a fight, and they later found a stash of weapons in his car including a .44 Magnum gun. Eventually, despite the risks, the second arrest team entered the real estate office and arrested Michael Poland uneventfully. However, he refused to answer questions and insisted his brother do the same. No fingerprints linked them to the murdered guards or the armored car. Trials and convictions State and federal prosecutors split the charges and the Poland brothers went on trial for robbery and kidnapping in federal court on February 15, 1979, were found guilty on those charges based on the circumstantial evidence alone, and were sentenced to 100 years in prison. In November 1979, an Arizona state jury returned the guilty verdict for murder and that meant the death penalty for both of them but they appealed their convictions. The Arizona Supreme Court found that the testimony of a hypnotized witness and the taser gun evidence should not have been used. They also found out that the jury had inappropriately discussed the federal trial and that meant their murder convictions were overturned and parole laws at the time meant they would be eligible for parole in less than seven years. In 1982, an Arizona prosecutor declined a retrial for the brothers due to cost and evidence already excluded by the Arizona Supreme Court. U.S Attorney Melvin Macdonald, outraged that the Poland brothers would possibly get away with murder, was deputized as an Arizona State Prosecutor. In spite of evidence difficulties prosecutors decided to try to determine the time the victims had been deposited in Lake Mead and prove that it was the same time the Polands were at the lake. After much pondering a crucial piece of evidence was found, in the form of Cecil Newkirk's self-winding watch, which stopped working at 10:37 p.m on May 26, 1977. That particular watch would stop working if it were not moved for 12 hours, which meant that the watch stopped working 12 hours after the deceased guard's arm came to rest at the bottom of Lake Mead. But to prove it they actually had watch experts from Switzerland examine it to determine that the watch did not stop due to water damage. Forensics experts used this evidence to estimate when the bodies had been dumped into the water. Their estimation exactly matched the time the FBI had established that the Polands were at the lake, getting their pickup towed from Bonelli Landing. The prosecutor explained that the Polands had indeed been there to dump the bodies and that convinced the jury to return the guilty verdict for murder for Michael and Patrick Poland on November 18, 1982. The defendants appealed again but this time, the United States Supreme Court affirmed the death sentences for the Polands. In 1997 the brothers brought separate cases against the State of Arizona, stating that they had not been informed that their conduct could result in the death penalty, which was rejected by the judge. In 1998, Michael Poland's lawyers argued that he could not be executed because had to complete his federal sentence first, which was due to finish in 2045. Attempted escape In 1997 Michael Poland's cell on Death Row was searched and found to include an escape plan, handcuff keys, a suicide drug, several knives and a lock pick. The plan was foiled when he offered $2 million to a prison guard to help him escape. Patrick Poland's confession In 1987, Patrick Poland agreed to tell investigators and the families of the victims exactly what happened. FBI Special Agent Frank Mallory (Rtd.) took his confession. Prior to the robbery, the Polands had spent almost a year tailing the van. They had knowledge of its route on the mornings when it went to Prescott and delivered the money to the banks in Prescott, the route it took plus the stops it made and the times for the stops. For the heist it was decided that both of the brothers' own cars would not be used. They rented one which investigators could not conclusively find. They put on an emergency lighting system, a siren that could be turned on with a simple switch, along with a license plate similar to the one used by the Arizona Highway Patrol and the department's door decals. They readied their tools needed for the heist, including a uniform similar to the one used by the Arizona Highway Patrol to be worn, and went to an ideal spot to wait. Their plan was to stop the van on the pretext of speeding then go to a remote spot to steal the money. A problem with the van's side door latch meant they were delayed for an hour, and the brothers had to wait for that hour. But when they saw it, they put their plan into action. Michael hid under the dash while Patrick drove the car. After pulling the armored car over, Patrick went to the side of the van and approached the guards and asked the driver to step out, but then Michael went to the other side of the armored car and the brothers took the guards captive. Patrick Poland continued to drive the fake police vehicle while the other was to drive the armored truck. However, when Patrick left, his brother did not follow so he reversed the fake cruiser in front of the armored car and then proceeded to see what was going on. By the time he reached the back Michael was already beating the two guards and Patrick told him to stop and Michael went to get a pair of tasers which they used to stun the guards. The brothers drove the vehicles to a remote area near the town of Bumble Bee, where they abandoned the truck. Patrick's decision to reverse the car to a spot in front of the van, left the tire tracks which would later be found by investigators. In the remote area, after seeing that one of the couriers seemed to have died from the beating, Michael Poland made up his mind, retrieved a makeshift garrote from his pocket and strangled the other courier to death, then they took the money, totaling $293,000, and then took the bodies of the couriers to Lake Mead, where using a rented boat, they dumped the bodies. After the crimes, they buried the rest of the money in the desert, the location was known also by a female relative of theirs. But the money had rotted in the years ever since the robbery. For her cooperation that relative was not prosecuted. Executions After his lawyers tried multiple appeals for the death sentence to be commuted to life due to the fact that the time he had spent waiting on death row had made him insane; all of which were denied, the State of Arizona administered a lethal injection to Michael Poland on June 16, 1999. He requested, for his last meal: three fried eggs sunny side up; four slices of bacon, an order of hash browns, two slices of whole wheat toast with two pats of real butter, two individual serving size boxes of Raisin Bran cereal, two cartons of milk, and two cups of Tasters Choice coffee. In the execution chamber, Michael raised his head several times to look at the window into the witness chamber as his death warrant was being read. The last words he mouthed to two of his sons and a daughter-in-law who witnessed the execution were simply \\"I love you,\\". The lethal injection procedure for Michael Poland was carried out at 3:12 p.m. During that time Poland's chest heaved several times as the lethal dose of medications began flowing. He puffed out his cheeks twice before being declared dead at 3:14 p.m. Nine months later, despite multiple appeals for clemency, in part due to Patrick Poland's allocation by among others, Melvin McDonald, whose involvement had led to the brothers' being successfully sentenced to death, all petitions for clemency were denied. Patrick Poland was executed on March 15, 2000. During one of the clemency hearings, the relatives of Cecil Newkirk and Russell Dempsey, the two guards murdered during the robbery, were not forgiving. Newkirk's widow sent a letter to the clemency panel stating that Patrick Poland had to pay with his life. Camilla Strongin, a Department of Corrections spokeswoman, said Poland spent his final hours with a Catholic priest, receiving last rites about 2 1/2 hours before his execution. Among the witnesses to the execution included the widow of one of the murdered guards, Lola Newkirk; relatives of the deceased, Patrick's girlfriend; Sherri Jo Christensen, and also Melvin McDonald, the Arizona state prosecutor who had originally ensured that the brothers would be sentenced to death, but tried to persuade the Arizona Board of Executive Clemency to commute Patrick's death sentence to life in prison yet failed. \\"I hope that his death will bring [the dead men's families] peace\\", said McDonald. He added, however, that \\"Mr. Poland paid for this crime each and every day for 23 years. I think he had genuine remorse. I felt justice was done in the execution of the first brother ... I felt mercy could have been done today by giving Patrick Poland life in prison.\\" Unlike his brother, Patrick asked for no last meal, and used what time he had left to express regret for the suffering he and his brother had caused. His last words were, \\"If I may, once again, to the Newkirk and Dempsey families, please accept my apologies. I'm sincere. I'm sorry for the pain and suffering I have caused. I do thank you for your forgiveness. I ask my family to forgive me for the pain I have caused them. I ask all my friends and people who believed in me to please forgive me, and I ask the woman I love to remember I will always love her.\\" The lethal injection procedure commenced at 3:03 p.m. As the lethal chemicals started flowing into his system, Poland's head jerked four times. His body shook slightly, his head rolled to the side and his eyes shut. He was pronounced dead four minutes later, at 3:07 p.m.  See also  * Capital punishment in Arizona * Crime in Arizona * List of people executed in Arizona  References  Category:1977 murders in the United States Category:Crimes in Arizona Category:Robberies of armored vehicles Arizona armored car robbery Category:Robberies in the United States Arizona armored car robbery Category:May 1977 events in the United States ","title":"1977 Arizona armored car robbery"},{"id":"35781984","text":"Nowghab-e Afzalabad (, also Romanized as NowghƒÅb-e AfzalƒÅbƒÅd; also known as NowghƒÅb, AfzalƒÅbƒÅd, NaughƒÅb, and N≈´ghƒÅb) is a village in Fasharud Rural District, in the Central District of Birjand County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

The Point Valour was originally ordered by the Foundation Maritime company and the original name was the Foundation Valour. There are two other \\"sister\\" boats to the Valour and the original names are Foundation Victor (Ex Jerry Newberry , currently R. J. Ballott ) and the Foundation Vibert (currently Florence M.). The Point Valour is 98' long by 28' wide, but because of the rubber strips and the tires which are chained to the side of the bulwarks to act as bumpers the tug is approximately 104' long by approximately 30' wide and has a reinforcing hull able to break ice up to five feet thick. The propeller on this tug measure approximately 9' straight across. Unlike many other tugs which are \\"modernized\\", there has been very little done to this tug - most of it is all original from 1958. History In 1973 when the Foundation Maritime company sold their tug fleet, they renamed the company Eastern Canada Towing Ltd. and when they sold the tug fleet they renamed the tugs from \\"Foundation\\" to \\"Point\\". In 1992 Thunder Bay Tug Services purchased the Point Valour and has since become one of the main work boats for Thunder Bay Tug Services.

It unified the provision of network infrastructure across the United Kingdom public sector into an interconnected \\"network of networks\\" to increase efficiency and reduce overall public expenditure. Origins The Public Services Network (PSN) was launched officially as part of the Transformational Government Strategy commencing in 2005, under the original name of the Public Sector Network. Prior to this, some parts of local government had already successfully implemented the concept. The Hampshire Public Services Network (HPSN) was the first PSN, launched in 1999, followed closely by Kent County Councils partnerships with the KPSN. The HPSN, encompassing all of the borough, district and unitary councils, with the County Council, as well as the Fire Services, the Isle of Wight Council and 540 schools. National PSN technical and architecture compliance criteria were established from 2007, by GDS working with local government leaders from Socitm (the Society of Information Technology Management) on the National CIO Council and the Local CIO Council. The PSN's aim was to bring public services organisations with a common interest onto a single, coherent and standards-based ‚Äònetwork of networks‚Äô. This would create influence, economies of scale and a commonality of standards for secure and easy inter-connection between public service organisations. The original concept of a network of networks strategy was based upon the work already undertaken in local government and recognition of Communities of Interest (COI) within the Criminal Justice Sector during work by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform (OCJR) between 2005 and 2007 to enable data sharing across business units. In this context a COI was defined as groups of Government departments and external partners who in combination provided services within a specific area of operation and used the same data, with a similar risk profile, shared risk appetite and common governance framework. Historically each group member had implemented their own networks and standards of operation in isolation with little or no consideration as to how services and data may be shared and resulting in increased costs of operation. The Network of Networks strategy proposed within OCJR recommended the creation of specific networks based upon these Communities of Interest which were joined together through data interchange gateways supporting common standards. Under this approach networks would be arranged by data type and business functions such as Criminal Justice, Health and Social Care, Defence and Intelligence or Public Finance rather than solely on established departmental boundaries. Within a COI, trust relationships and data interchange are readily supported, enabling data sharing without a need to cross network boundaries and providing benefits of scale without the challenges and compromises intrinsic to homogeneous cross sector networks. Data is made available without a need to transport it between organisations and control is retained by the data originator. In early 2007 a group of UK Government department CTOs in conjunction with the Office for Government Commerce Buying Solutions (OGC BS) established the vision for a single commonly provided, procured and managed public sector voice and data network infrastructure to replace the multitude of separately procured and managed networks serving various segments of the UK public sector; Education, Health, Central Government, Local Government etc. In 2008 an Industry Working Group was established to document the objectives and requirements more clearly. Their report set out the architectural and commercial principles as well as anticipated security, service management, governance and transition arrangements. Architecture The PSN comprises a core network, the Government Conveyancing Network or GCN provided by GCN Service Providers or GCNSPs. The GCN interconnects multiple operator networks, termed Direct Network Service Providers or DNSPs. Subscriber organisations contract to a connection from a local participating DNSP, connect via that to GCN and hence onwards to other interconnected networks and services. The GCN network is entirely based on IPv4 and MPLS and the GCNSPs are not currently mandated to provide IPv6, though they should have a roadmap to implementing it if and when required. Commercial framework In 2010 Virgin Media Business, BT, Cable & Wireless and Global Crossing signed Deeds of Undertaking (DoU) and subsequently achieved accreditation for providing GCN and IP VPN services. In March 2012, BT, Cable & Wireless, Capita Business Services, Eircom, Fujitsu, Kcom, Level 3, Logicalis, MDNX, Thales, Updata and Virgin Media Business were successful bidders for the initial two-year PSN Connectivity framework. In June 2012, 29 companies were confirmed as suppliers of ICT services to the UK public sector under the Government's PSN Services framework contract. Apart from most of the previous suppliers, additional companies also included 2e2, Airwave Solutions, Azzurri Communications, Cassidian, CSC Computer Sciences, Computacenter, Daisy Communications, Easynet Global Services, Everything Everywhere, Freedom Communications, Icom Holdings, NextiraOne, PageOne Communications, Phoenix IT Group, Siemens Communications, Specialist Computer Centres, Telef√≥nica, telent Technology Services, Uniworld Communications and Vodafone. Governance The PSN is managed within the Cabinet Office where it is part of the Government Digital Service. Early implementations There were already notable initiatives in progress in county council areas, demonstrating public sector network integration in both the Hampshire HPSN2 network and in Kent's community network. Project Pathway was established as a pilot linking these two county-wide networks, with Virgin Media Business and Global Crossing the subscriber and GCN network elements. Staffordshire County Council was the first council in England to establish a PSN that included the county's NHS Health partners. Other county councils have since followed the leads of these councils. Transition Centrally procured public sector networks are expected to migrate across to the PSN framework as they reach the end of their contract terms, either through an interim framework or directly. The Government Secure Intranet (GSi) contracts expired in September 2011, running on to 12 February 2012 and were replaced by the transitional Government Secure Intranet Convergence Framework (GCF). The Managed Telephony Service (MTS) contract expired on 31 December 2011 and was replaced by the Managed Telephony Convergence Framework (MTCF).  Future plan  In a blog post published on 20 January 2017, Government Digital Service announced that the Technology Leaders Network (TLN) had agreed that government was starting a journey away from the PSN. This was because using the Internet was considered suitable for the vast majority of the work that the public sector does. The blog post confirmed that the 'move was not going to happen immediately' and stated that 'there's quite a bit of work to do across the public sector to prepare for the changes'. It also stated that it was too early for a full timeline to be provided, although all PSN-connected organisations would be updated as the process evolved. The blog post confirmed that organisations that need to access services that are only available on the PSN would still need to connect to it for the time being and continue to meet its assurance requirements. In a blog post published on 16 March 2017, Government Digital Service set out its plans for PSN assurance. The blog post confirmed that the PSN compliance process wasn't 'going anywhere, certainly for a while yet'. It explained that the TLN agreed that ‚Äì as one of the only recognised, externally accredited, cross-government common assurance standards ‚Äì it 'needs to live on far beyond the end of the physical PSN network'. Government Digital Service, along with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the Cyber and Government Security Directorate, are now looking at ways to expand and reframe PSN compliance in a new context that, while retaining the assurance principles that are the basis of the existing process, will aim to improve the process.

Viko New Zealand Ltd [1999] (1 NZLR 395) case was the last of numerous New Zealand cases cited regarding whether or not banking (depositing) a cheque received for part payment was legally accord and satisfaction. In this case, it was the only NZ case not subject to a dispute, that the creditor was successful in being able to claim for the balance from the debtor.  Background  Magnum had supplied Viko with imagining equipment and for reasons not stated, Viko did not pay Magnum, resulting in Magnum taking legal action in the High Court. Magnum ultimately obtained judgement against Viko for $275,450.95. Viko unhappy with this ruling, filed an appeal with the court, and soon after wrote the following letter to Magnum's solicitors saying they are confident in winning the appeal, and tendered a cheque for $124,677.18 as a settlement agreement. > \\"Whilst Viko is confident of its chances of success on appeal, it is clear > that both parties face litigation risk.

Magnum's lawyers realised the mistake the following day, and contacted Viko's lawyers to notify them of the error, offering to immediately refund the cheque, and even go as far as suggest they cancel the cheque. > \\"We refer to your letter of 2 December 1997 which was accompanied by a > cheque for $124,677.18.

But childbirth in antiquity remained a life-threatening experience for both the woman and her newborn, with infant mortality as high as 30 or 40 percent.M. Golden, \\"Did the Ancients Care When Their Children Died?\\" Greece & Rome 35 (1988) 152‚Äì163; Keith R. Bradley, \\"Wet-nursing at Rome: A Study in Social Relations,\\" in The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives (Cornell University Press, 1986, 1992), p. 202; Beryl Rawson, Children and Childhood in Roman Italy (Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 104. Rites of passage pertaining to birth and death had several parallel aspects.Anthony Corbeill, \\"Blood, Milk, and Tears: The Gestures of Mourning Women,\\" in Nature Embodied: Gesture in Ancient Rome (Princeton University Press, 2004), pp. 67‚Äì105. Maternal death was common: one of the most famous was Julia, daughter of Julius Caesar and wife of Pompey. Her infant died a few days later, severing the family ties between her father and husband and hastening the Caesar's Civil War, which ended the Roman Republic.Rawson, Children and Childhood in Roman Italy, p. 103. Some ritual practices may be characterized as anxious superstitions, but the religious aura surrounding childbirth reflects the high value Romans placed on family, tradition (mos maiorum), and compatibility of the sexes.Rawson, Children and Childhood in Roman Italy, p. 99. Under the Empire, children were celebrated on coins, as was Juno Lucina, the primary goddess of childbirth, as well as in public art.Rawson, Children and Childhood in Roman Italy, p. 64. Funerary art, such as relief on sarcophagi, sometimes showed scenes from the deceased's life, including birth or the first bath.Rawson, Children and Childhood in Roman Italy, pp. 101‚Äì102. Only those who died after the age of 10 were given full funeral and commemorative rites, which in ancient Rome were observed by families several days during the year (see Parentalia). Infants less than one year of age received no formal rites. The lack of ritual observances pertains to the legal status of the individual in society, not the emotional response of families to the loss.Rawson, Children and Childhood in Roman Italy, p. 104. As Cicero reflected: > Some think that if a small child dies this must be borne with equanimity; if > it is still in its cradle there should not even be a lament. And yet it is > from the latter that nature has more cruelly demanded back the gift she had > given.Cicero, Tusculan Disputations 1.93,as cited by Rawson, Children and > Childhood in Roman Italy, p. 104. Sources The most extensive lists of deities pertaining to the conception- birth-development cycle come from the Church Fathers, especially Augustine of Hippo and Tertullian. Augustine in particular is known to have used the now- fragmentary theological works of Marcus Terentius Varro, the 1st century BC Roman scholar, who in turn referenced the books of the Roman pontiffs. The purpose of the patristic writers was to debunk traditional Roman religion, but they provide useful information despite their mocking tone.Beard et al., Religions of Rome,vol. 2, p. 33. Scattered mentions occur throughout Latin literature. The following list of deities is organized chronologically by the role they play in the process.The order is based on that of Robert Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome (Routledge, 2001; originally published in French 1998), pp. 18‚Äì20, and J√∂rg R√ºpke, Religion in Republican Rome: Rationalization and Ritual Change (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002), pp. 181‚Äì182. Conception and pregnancy The gods of the marriage bed (di coniugales) are also gods of conception.Beard, Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook, vol. 2, pp. 32‚Äì33; R√ºpke, Religion of the Romans, p. 79. Juno, one of the three deities of the Capitoline Triad, presides over union and marriage as well, and some of the minor deities invoked for success in conceiving and delivering a child may have been functional aspects of her powers. * Jugatinus is a conjugal god, from iugare, \\"to join, yoke, marry.\\"Augustine, De Civitate Dei 6.9.Ludwig Preller, R√∂mische Mythologie (Berlin, 1881), vol. 1, p. 211. * Cinxia functions within the belt (cingulum) that the bride wears to symbolize that her husband is \\"belted and bound\\" (cinctus vinctusque) to her.Festus 55 (edition of Lindsay); Karen K. Hersch, The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 101, 110, 211. It was tied with the knot of Hercules, intended to be intricate and difficult to untie.William Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic (London, 1908), p. 142. Augustine calls this goddess Virginiensis (virgo, \\"virgin\\"), indicating that the untying is the symbolic loss of virginity.For an extensive look at the knot of virginity, primarily in early Christian culture, see S. Panayotakis, \\"The Knot and the Hymen: A Reconsideration of Nodus Virginitatis (Hist. Apoll. 1),\\" Mnemosyne 53.5 (2000) 599‚Äì608. Cinxia may have been felt as present during a ritual meant to ease labor. The man who fathered the child removes his own belt (cinctus), binds it (cinxerit) around the laboring woman, then releases it with a prayer that the one who has bound her in labor should likewise release her: \\"he should then leave.\\"Pliny, Natural History 28.42; Anthony Corbeill, Nature Embodied: Gesture in Ancient Rome (Princeton University Press, 2004), pp. 35‚Äì36. Women who had experienced spontaneous abortions were advised to bind their bellies for the full nine months with a belt (cingulum) of wool from a lamb fed upon by a wolf.Attributed to Theodorus Priscianus, Additamenta 10; Corbeill, Nature Embodied, p. 37. See also Marcellus Empiricus, De medicamentis 10.70 and 82. * Subigus is the god (deus) who causes the bride to give in to her husband.Augustine, De Civitate Dei 6.9. The name derives from the verb subigo, subigere, \\"to cause to go under; tame, subdue,\\" used of the active role in sexual intercourse, hence \\"cause to submit sexually\\".J.N. Adams, The Latin Sexual Vocabulary (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982), pp. 155‚Äì156. The verb is used in the satiric verses chanted by the soldiers at the triumph of Julius Caesar, where he is said to have caused the Gauls to submit (see Gallic Wars), and to have submitted himself to Nicomedes. A subigitatrix was a woman who took the active role in fondling (Plautus, Persa 227). * Prema is the insistent sex act, from the verb primo, primere, to press upon. Although the verb usually describes the masculine role, Augustine calls Prema dea Mater, a mother goddess.Adams, Latin Sexual Vocabulary, p. 182; Augustine, De Civitate Dei 6.9. * Inuus (\\"Entry\\"), the phallic god Mutunus Tutunus, and Pertunda enable sexual penetration. Inuus, sometimes identified with Faunus, embodies the mammalian impulse toward mating. The cult of Mutunus was associated with the sacred fascinum.The cult of this god was either misunderstood or deliberately misrepresented by Church Fathers as a ritual deflowering during marriage rites; no Roman source describes such a thing. See Mutunus Tutunus. Both these gods are attested outside conception litany. Pertunda is the female personificationSissa, \\"Maidenhood without Maidenhead,\\" p. 362. of the verb pertundere, \\"to penetrate\\",Augustine of Hippo, De Civitate Dei 6.9.3. and seems to be a name for invoking a divine power specific to this function. * Janus, the forward- and backward-facing god of doorways and passages, \\"opened up access to the generative seed which was provided by Saturn,\\" the god of sowing.Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 18. * Consevius or Deus Consevius, also Consivius, is the god of propagation and insemination,R√ºpke, Religion in Republican Rome, p. 181. from con-serere, \\"to sow.\\" It is a title of Janus as a creator god or god of beginnings.Fowler, Roman Festivals, p. 289. Macrobius, Saturnalia \`1.9, lists Consivius among the titles of Janus from the act of sowing (a conserendo), that is, \\"the propagation of the human race,\\" with Janus as the auctor (\\"increaser,\\" source, author). Macrobius says that the title Consivia also belongs to the goddess Ops. Child's sarcophagus (150-160 AD) depicting the festivities attending the birth of Dionysus; the basin at far left represents the baby's first bath * Liber Pater (\\"Father Liber\\") empowers the man to release his semen,Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 18, citing Augustine, De Civitate Dei 6.9.3. while Libera does the same for the woman, who was regarded as also contributing semina, \\"seed.\\"R√ºpke, Religion in Republican Rome, p. 181. * Mena or Dea Mena with Juno assured menstrual flow,Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 18, citing Augustine, De Civitate Dei IV.11: dea Mena, quam praefecerunt menstruis feminarum :\\"The goddess Mena, who was put in charge of menstruation\\" This may seem illogically placed in the sequence; Roman girls were not married until they were ready for childbearing, so menstruation would mark the bride as old enough to marry, and conception would halt the flow. which is redirected to feed the developing child.R√ºpke, Religion in Republican Rome, p. 181. * Fluonia or Fluvionia, from fluo, fluere, \\"to flow,\\" is a form of Juno who retains the nourishing blood within the womb.Tertullian, Ad nationes 2.11.3; Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 18. Women attended to the cult of Juno Fluonia \\"because she held back the flow of blood (i.e., menstruation) in the act of conception.\\"Excerpts from Paulus in Festus, p. 82 (edition of Lindsay): mulieres colebant, quod eam sanguinis fluorem in conceptu retinere putabant. Medieval mythographers noted this aspect of Juno,Juno \\"is called Fluonia, from the flowing (fluoribus) of seed, because she frees women in childbirth,\\" according to the Third Vatican Mythographer, as translated by Ronald E. Pepin, The Vatican Mythographers (Fordham University Press, 2008), p. 225. Fluoribus might also be translated as \\"emissions, discharge.\\" The Berlin Commentary to the De nuptiis of Martianus Capella (2.92) compares this moisture to the dew that drips from the air and nourishes seeds; Haijo Jan Westra and Tanja Kupke, The Berlin Commentary on Martianus Capella's De Nuptiis Philologie et Mercurii, Book II (Brill, 1998), p. 93. which marked a woman as a mater rather than a virgo.In his commentary on the De nuptiis of Martianus Capella, Remigius of Auxerre \\"explains Fluvonia from the contraceptive use of the discharges of seeds to free women from childbirth\\"; see Jane Chance, Medieval Mythography from Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433‚Äì1177 (University Press of Florida, 1994), p.286. * Alemona feeds the embryoTertullian, De anima 37.1 (Alemonam alendi in utero fetus); Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 18. or generally nourished growth in utero.R√ºpke, Religion in Republican Rome, p. 181. * Vitumnus endows the fetus with vita, \\"life\\" or the vital principle or power of life (see also quickening).R√ºpke, Religion in Republican Rome, p. 181. Augustine calls him the vivificator, \\"creator of life,\\" and links him with Sentinus (following) as two \\"very obscure\\" gods who are examples of the misplaced priorities of the Roman pantheon. These two gods, he suggests, should merit inclusion among the di selecti, \\"select\\" or principal gods, instead of those who preside over physical functions such as Janus, Saturn, Liber and Libera.Augustine, De Civitate Dei 7.2‚Äì3; see also Tertullian, Ad nationes 2.11. Both Vitumnus and Sentinus were most likely names that focalized the functions of Jove.Preller, R√∂mische Mythologie, p. 208. * Sentinus or Sentia gives sentience or the powers of sense perception (sensus).Augustine, De Civitate Dei 7.3.1; R√ºpke, Religion in Republican Rome, p. 181. Augustine calls him the sensificator, \\"creator of sentience.\\"Augustine's point is that a monotheistic concept of deity obviates the need for dispersing these functions and for a divine taxonomy that is based on knowledge rather than faith. One view of the success of Christianity is that it was simple to understand and required a less complex theology; see Preller, R√∂mische Mythologie, p. 208, and Michael Lipka, Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach (Brill, 2009), pp. 84‚Äì88. =The Parcae= The Parcae are the three goddesses of fate (tria fata): Nona, Decima, and Parca (singular of Parcae), also known as Partula in relation to birthing. Nona and Decima determine the right time for birth, assuring the completion of the nine-month term (ten in Roman inclusive counting).Tertullian, De anima 37.1. Parca or Partula oversees partus, birth as the initial separation from the mother's body (as in English '\\"postpartum\\").Varro, as preserved by Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights 3.16.9‚Äì10; R√ºpke, Religion in Republican Rome, p. 181. At the very moment of birth, or immediately after, Parca establishes that the new life will have a limit, and therefore she is also a goddess of death called Morta (English \\"mortal\\").S. Breemer and J. H. Waszink, \\"Fata Scribunda,\\" in Opuscula Selecta (Brill, 1979), p. 247. The profatio Parcae, \\"prophecy of Parca,\\" marked the child as a mortal being, and was not a pronouncement of individual destiny.Breemer and Waszink, \\"Fata Scribunda,\\" p. 248. The first week of the child's life was regarded as an extremely perilous and tentative time, and the child was not recognized as an individual until the dies lustricus. Birthing The primary deity presiding over the delivery was Juno Lucina, who may in fact be a form of Diana. Those invoking her aid let their hair down and loosened their clothing as a form of reverse binding ritual intended to facilitate labor.Corbeill, Nature Embodied, p. 36. Soranus advised women about to give birth to unbind their hair and loosen clothing to promote relaxation, not for any magical effect.Corbeill, Nature Embodied, p. 36. Swaddled infant (Gallo-Roman terracotta votive) * Egeria, the nymph, received sacrifices from pregnant women in order to bring out (egerere) the baby.Festus p. 67 (edition of Lindsay): Egeriae nymphae sacrificabant praegnantes, quod eam putabant facile conceptum alvo egere; Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 18. * Postverta and Prosa avert breech birth.Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 18. * Diespiter (Jupiter) brings the baby toward the daylight.Augustine, De Civitate Dei 4.11; Tertullian, Ad nationes 2.11; R√ºpke, Religion in Republican Rome, p. 181. * Lucina introduces the baby to the light (lux, lucis).Ovid, Fasti 2.451f.; R√ºpke, Religion in Republican Rome, p. 181. * Vagitanus or Vaticanus opens the newborn's mouth for its first cry.Aulus Gellius 16.1.2. * Levana lifts the baby, who was ceremonially placed on the ground after birth in symbolic contact with Mother Earth. (In antiquity, kneeling or squatting was a more common birthing position than it is in modern times; see di nixi.Pierre Grimal, The Dictionary of Classical Mythology (Blackwell, 1986, 1996, originally published 1951 in French), pp. 311‚Äì312; Charles J. Adamec, \\"Genu, genus,\\" Classical Philology 15 (1920), p. 199; J.G. Frazer, Pausanias's Description of Greece (London, 1913), vol. 4, p. 436; Marcel Le Glay, \\"Remarques sur la notion de Salus dans la religion romaine,\\" La soteriologia dei culti orientali nell' imperio romano: √âtudes pr√©liminaires au religions orientales dans l'empire romain, Colloquio internazionale Roma, 1979 (Brill, 1982), p. 442.) The midwife then cut the umbilical cord and presented the newborn to the mother, a scene sometimes depicted on sarcophagi. A grandmother or maternal aunt next cradled the infant in her arms; with a finger covered in lustral saliva, she massaged the baby's forehead and lips, a gesture meant to ward off the evil eye.Persius 2.31‚Äì34; Robert Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome (Routledge, 2001; originally published in French 1998), p. 20. * Statina (also Statilina, Statinus or Statilinus) gives the baby fitness or \\"straightness,\\"Tertullian, De anima 39.2; Augustine, De Civitate Dei 4.21. and the father held it up to acknowledge his responsibility to raise it. Unwanted children might be abandoned at the Temple of Pietas or the Columna Lactaria. Newborns with serious birth defects might be drowned or smothered.Seneca, De ira 1.15.2. =Into the light= Gallo-Roman goddesses (2nd or 3rd century, Bordeaux) Lucina as a title of the birth goddess is usually seen as a metaphor for bringing the newborn into the light (lux, lucis).Ovid provides an alternate derivation as the \\"goddess of the grove\\" (lucus), but in ancient etymology the word lucus itself was thought to derive from luc-, \\"light\\": the lucus as a \\"sacred grove\\" was actually the creation of a clearing (i.e., the letting in of light) within a grove to make a sacred place. The sacred grove of Lucina was located on the Esquiline Hill. Luces, plural (\\"lights\\"), can mean \\"periods of light, daylight hours, days.\\" Diespiter, \\"Father of Day,\\" is thus her masculine counterpart; if his name is taken as a doublet for Jupiter, then Juno Lucina and Diespiter can be understood as a male-female complement.Celia E. Schultz, Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic (University of North Carolina Press, 2006), pp. 79‚Äì81; Michael Lipka, Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach (Brill, 2009), pp. 141‚Äì142 Diespiter, however, is also identified in Latin literature with the ruler of the underworld, Dis pater. The functions of \\"chthonic\\" deities such as Dis (or Pluto) and his consort Proserpina are not confined to death; they are often concerned with agricultural fertility and the giving of nourishment for life, since plants for food grow from seeds hidden in the ground. In the mystery religions, the divine couple preside over the soul's \\"birth\\" or rebirth in the afterlife. The shadowy goddess Mana Genita was likewise concerned with both birth and mortality, particularly of infants, as was Hecate.H.J. Rose, The Roman Questions of Plutarch (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924, 1974), p. 192; David and Noelle Soren, A Roman Villa and a Late Roman Infant Cemetery (¬´L'Erma¬ª di Bretschneider, 1999), p. 520. In contrast to the vast majority of deities, both birth goddesses and underworld deities received sacrifices at night.Lipka, Roman Gods, p. 154, especially note 22. The animal sacrifices offered to most deities are domestic herd animals normally raised for food; the deity honored is given a portion, and the rest of the roasted flesh is shared by humans in a communal meal. Both birth goddesses and chthonic deities, however, typically receive an inedible victim, often puppies or bitches, in the form of a holocaust or burnt offering, with no shared meal. Ancient writers conventionally situate labor and birth at night; it may be that night is thought of as the darkness of the womb, from which the newborn emerges into the (day)light. The cyclical place of the goddess Candelifera, \\"She who bears the candle\\",Tertullian, Ad nationes 2.11: is uncertain. It is sometimes thought that she provides an artificial light for labor that occurs at night. A long labor was considered likely for first-time mothers, so at least a part of the birthing process would occur at night.The passage in Tertullian has a problematic point that may specify first births; Gaston Boissier, √âtude sur la vie et les ouvrages de M.T. Varron (Hachette, 1861), pp. 234‚Äì235. According to Plutarch,Plutarch, Roman Questions 2. light symbolizes birth, but the candle may have been thought of as less a symbol than an actual kindling of life,H.J. Rose, The Roman Questions of Plutarch (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924, 1974), p. 170. or a magic equivalent to the life of the infant.Eli Edward Burriss, Taboo, Magic, Spirits: A Study of Primitive Elements in Roman Religion (1931; Forgotten Books reprint, 2007), p. 34. Candelifera may also be the nursery light kept burning against spirits of darkness that would threaten the infant in the coming week.Rose, The Roman Questions of Plutarch, pp. 79, 170. Even in the Christian era, lamps were lit in nurseries to illuminate sacred images and drive away child-snatching demons such as the Gello.According to Leo Allatios, De Graecorum hodie quorundam opinationibus IV (1645), p. 188 as cited by Karen Hartnup, On the Beliefs of the Greeks: Leo Allatios and Popular Orthodoxy (Brill, 2004), p. 95. Neonatal care Once the child came into the light, a number of rituals were enacted over the course of the following week.R√ºpke, Religion in Republican Rome, p. 181. An offerings table received congratulatory sacrifices from the mother's female friends.Nonius, p. 312, 11‚Äì13, as cited by Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 19. Three deities‚ÄîIntercidona, Pilumnus, and Deverra‚Äîwere invoked to drive away Silvanus, the wild woodland god of trees:Augustine, De Civitate Dei 6.9.2. three men secured the household every night by striking the threshold (limen; see liminality) with an axe and then a pestle, followed by sweeping it. Drawing of a scene on an Etruscan mirror, in which Uni (Juno) suckles the adult Hercle (Hercules) before he ascends to immortality In the atrium of the house, a bed was made up for Juno, and a table set for Hercules.Servius Danielis, note to Eclogue 4.62 and Aeneid 10.76. In the Hellenized mythological tradition, Juno tried to prevent the birth of Hercules, as it resulted from Jupiter's infidelity. Ovid has Lucina crossing her knees and fingers to bind the labor.Ovid, Metamorphoses 9.298‚Äì299; Corbeill, Nature Embodied, pp. 37, 93. Etruscan religion, however, emphasized the role that Juno (as Uni) played in endowing Hercle with his divine nature through the drinking of her breast milk. * Intercidona provides the axe without which trees cannot be cut (intercidere). * Pilumnus or Picumnus grants the pestle necessary for making flour from grain. * Deverra gives the broom with which grain was swept up (verrere) (compare Averruncus). * Juno in her bed represents the nursing mother.Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 19. * Hercules represents the child who requires feeding. * Rumina promotes suckling.Augustine, De Civitate Dei 4.11, 21, 34; 7.11. This goddess received libations of milk, an uncommon liquid offering among the Romans.Plutarch, Life of Romulus 4.1. * Nundina presides over the dies lustricus.Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.16.36. * At some point in time the two CarmentesAugustine, De Civitate Dei 4.11. (Antevorta and Postverta), had something to do with children's fates as well.Tertullian, De anima 39.2. Child development In well-to-do households, children were cared for by nursemaids (nutrices, singular nutrix, which can mean either a wet nurse who might be a slave or a paid professional of free status, or more generally any nursery maid, who would be a household slave). Mothers with a nursery staff were still expected to supervise the quality of care, education, and emotional wellbeing of children. Ideally, fathers would take an interest even in their infant children; Cato liked to be present when his wife bathed and swaddled their child.Plutarch, Life of Cato the Elder 20.2. Nursemaids might make their own bloodless offerings to deities who protected and fostered the growth of children.Varro, Logistorici frg. 9 (Bolisani), as cited by Lora L. Holland, \\"Women and Roman Religion,\\" in A Companion to Women in the Ancient World (Blackwell, 2012), p. 212. Most of the \\"teaching gods\\" are female, perhaps because they themselves were thought of as divine nursemaids. The gods who encourage speech, however, are male.Preller, R√∂mische Mythologie, p. 211. The ability to speak well was a defining characteristic of the elite citizen. Although women were admired for speaking persuasively,For example, according to Roman tradition the speech made by Lucretia in response to her rape sparked the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the Roman Republic. oratory was regarded as a masculine pursuit essential to public life.Joseph Farrell, Latin Language and Latin Culture (Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. 74‚Äì75; Richard A. Bauman, Women and Politics in Ancient Rome (Routledge, 1992, 1994), pp. 51‚Äì52. Head of a child from the alt= * Potina (Potica or Potua) from the noun potio \\"drink\\" (Bibesia in some source editions, cf verb bibo, bibere \\"drink\\") enables the child to drink.Augustine, De Civitate Dei 4.11, 34. * Edusa, from the verb edo, edere, esus, \\"eat,\\" also as Edulia, Edula, Educa, Edesia etc., enables the taking of nourishment.Augustine, De civitate Dei 4.11. The variations of her name may indicate that while her functional focus was narrow, her name had not stabilized; she was mainly a divine force to be invoked ad hoc for a specific purpose.Michael Lipka, Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach (Brill, 2009), pp. 126‚Äì127. * Ossipago builds strong bones;Arnobius, Adversus Nationes 4.7‚Äì8: Ossipago quae durat et solidat infantibus parvis ossa.

Roman boy wrapped in his cloak (1st century AD) * Catius pater, \\"Father Catius,\\" is invoked for sharpening the minds of children as they develop intellectually.Augustine, De Civitate Dei 4.21: Father Catius, \\"who makes [children] clever, that is, sharp-witted\\" (qui catos id est acutos faceret). * Farinus enables speech. * Fabulinus prompts the child's first words. * Locutius enables it to form sentences. * Mens (\\"Mind\\") provides it with intelligence. * Volumnus or Volumna grants the child the will to do good.Augustine, De Civitate Dei 4.21. * Numeria gives the child the ability to count. * Camena enables it to sing.Augustine, De Civitate Dei 4.11. * The Muses give the ability to appreciate the arts, literature, and science.Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 21. Children wore the toga praetexta, with a purple band that marked them as sacred and inviolable, and an amulet (bulla) to ward off malevolence. Later literature James Joyce mentions a few Roman birth deities by name in his works. In the \\"Oxen of the Sun\\" episode of Ulysses, he combines an allusion to Horace (nunc est bibendum) with an invocation of Partula and Pertunda (per deam Partulam et Pertundam) in anticipation of the birth of Purefoy.

The institute seeks to achieve scientific breakthroughs by constructing AI systems with reasoning, learning, and reading capabilities. Oren Etzioni was appointed by Paul Allen in September 2013 to direct the research at the institute. Projects *Aristo: A flagship project of AI2, inspired by a similar project called Project Halo carried out by Seattle-based investment company Vulcan. The goal is to design an artificially intelligent system that can successfully read, learn, and reason from texts and ultimately demonstrate its knowledge by providing explainable question answering. The focus of the project is explained by the guiding philosophy that artificial intelligence is about having a mental model for how things operate and refining that mental model based on new knowledge. *PRIOR: A ground-breaking research project on visual knowledge extraction that capitalizes on the wealth of information available in images. PRIOR aims to create knowledge bases composed entirely of information derived from images, both static and video. The PRIOR team released the game Iconary in February 2018 as a demonstration of an AI that can understand and produce situated scenes from a limited set of icons. *Semantic Scholar: This project is a platform for scientific literature search and discovery, focusing on semantics and textual understanding. This search engine allows users to find key survey papers about a topic or to produce a list of important citations or results in a given paper. Semantic Scholar officially launched on November 2, 2015. In September 2017, Semantic Scholar added biomedical papers to its corpus. *AllenNLP: AllenNLP is an open-source NLP research library built on PyTorch. AllenNLP also includes reference implementations of high-quality models for both core NLP problems (e.g. semantic role labeling) and NLP applications (e.g. textual entailment). *MOSAIC: The Mosaic project is focused on defining and building common sense knowledge and reasoning for AI systems. =Partnerships= In 2018, the institute partnered with the University of Washington to explore deep learning artificial intelligence designed to predict how dogs would respond to stimulus. Researchers used over 20,000 frames of video to train an AI to predict movements and learn other dog behavior. AI2 also partnered with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of Washington to develop an artificial intelligence named the \\"Composition, Retrieval and Fusion Network\\" (CRAFT). After the AI was trained with a database of over 25,000 videos from the U.S. television show The Flintstones, it was able to create novel short video clips from natural language captions that resembled the cartoon. Startup incubator The institute's startup incubator launched in 2015 with the intent to develop technologies in the artificial intelligence field. Media coverage AI2 was the subject of an in-depth article in The Verge. Its launch was covered in Xconomy, and GeekWire. Allen and Etzioni co-authored an article for CNN about artificial intelligence and AI2 in December 2013. AI2 has also been mentioned in other articles discussing the current state of and trends in artificial intelligence research.

He is a Republican member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for District 25 in Rapides Parish. Background Harris attended Louisiana College in his native Pineville and Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana. Harris owns the Leebo's chain of convenience stores. In the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 22, 2011, Harris defeated his only opponent, fellow Republican Barett Byrd, a retired colonel in the United States Marine Corps from Woodworth. Harris succeeded Democratic Representative Chris Roy, Jr., of Alexandria, effective January 2012. Harris defeated Byrd, 7,577 votes (55.5 percent) to 6,088 (44.6 percent) to claim the position. Harris was elected chairman of the Louisiana Republican legislative delegation in December 2012. In 2020, he was succeeded by Rep. Blake Miguez as chairman. At the beginning of his third term in 2020, Harris was named Chairman of the House Retirement Committee and additionally serves on the Appropriations Committee, the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget, and the House Select Leadership Committee. He is a member of the Louisiana Republican Legislative Delegation and the Louisiana Rural Caucus. Legislative record In 2013, Harris endorsed Governor Bobby Jindal's decision to withdraw a plan to increase sales taxes while at the same time repealing the state income tax. Jindal dropped the plan after opposition surfaced in public opinion polls and among legislators. \\"While repeal is off the table for this legislative session, we will continue to work on the issue so that we can craft a responsible way to achieve our objectives in reforming the tax code in the future,\\" Harris said. In 2015, Harris offered House Bill 672 to ease controversy arising from the Common Core State Standards Initiative, first proposed and subsequently opposed by Governor Bobby Jindal. The legislation would end Common Core standards and use temporarily the procedures from 2010 to 2011. \\"We're going back to 2010, where we were seeing increases in student involvement, our scores were going up. We're going to use that for one to one-and-a-half years until we have a system in place\\" with revised standards designed by educators and approved by the public, said Harris in a public forum in Alexandria. Harris's legislative ratings have ranged from 44 to 93 percent from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. In 2012, he was rated 100 percent by the National Federation of Independent Business. In 2013 and 2014, the conservative Louisiana Family Forum scored him 89 and 80 percent, respectively. Louisiana Right to Life scored him 100 percent both years. In 2013 and 2014, the Louisiana Association of Educators rated him 8 percent both years. In 2014, Harris co-sponsored the requirement that abortion providers have hospital admitting privileges near their clinics; the bill was approved by the full House, 88‚Äì5. In 2014, he did not vote on the issue of extending the time for implementation of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. He voted to prohibit the transportation of dogs in the beds of pick-up trucks while traveling on interstate highways; the measure passed the House, 53‚Äì34. He voted against the requirement that companies must give notice when they engage in hydraulic fracking. He voted against the repeal of the anti-sodomy laws. He voted to authorize surrogacy contracts. He voted to reduce the penalties for the possession of marijuana. He voted to establish lifetime concealed carry gun permits and supported concealed-carry privileges in restaurants that sell alcoholic beverages. He voted against making information about permit holders a matter of public record. He voted in 2013 against an increase in judicial pay but supported the removal of the mandatory retirement age for judges. In 2012, Harris voted to ban the use of telephones while driving; the measure passed the House, 68‚Äì29. He voted for tax incentives for attracting a National Basketball Association team to Louisiana and supported state income tax deductions for individuals who contribute to scholarship funds. He voted to reduce the number of hours that polling locations remain open; Louisiana has traditionally had 14-hour polling days. He co-sponsored the requirement for drug testing of certain welfare recipients, which passed the House, 65 to 26. He supported changes in the teacher tenure law. In his 2015 re-election bid, Harris faced opposition from the Democrat Vivian Ebare Brossett (born January 1967) of Boyce, who identified herself as a real estate broker, a former 12-year member of the Boyce Town Council, and a board member of the Louisiana Municipal Association. She formerly resided in Montgomery in Grant Parish. In May 2016, he wrote an amendment to Louisiana's hate crime statue, adding protections for police officers and firefighters who are targeted based on their profession. The amendment was signed into law by Governor John Bel Edwards.

This incident is now regarded by historians as unhistorical.Unmapping the Territory: Blind Hary's Wallace, Felicity Riddy's chapter in Edward Cowan's The Wallace Book (2007, ) No such mass killing of Scots nobles by the English took place around this time, although Edward I of England did become more ruthless very near the end of his life, executing several of Robert the Bruce's supporters.John Prebble The Lion in the North Book 4 of Barbour's epic poem The Bruce, an important near-contemporary source, mentions very briefly that \\"Sir Ranald of Crauford also, and Sir Bryce the Blair, were hanged in a barn at Ayr\\", but the context implies that this took place in 1306, the year after Wallace's execution.Translation into modern English by George Eyre-Todd, p. 54 Whether intentional or not, the purported incident seems to have been a counterfactual reorganization of plagiarized, inflated, roughly contemporary events. Some accounts describe Ronald Crawford as father of Reginald Crawford, a minor but known historical figure in the Wars of Scottish Independence. However, Reginald Crawford was made Sheriff of Ayr in 1296,Michael Penman, Robert the Bruce, King of the Scots which is difficult to reconcile with the traditional story. A version of this incident appears in the film Braveheart, where Wallace is shown as witnessing the mass hanging as a boy. This is even further wide of the mark as Scotland was not under English occupation during Wallace's boyhood.Peter Traquair Freedom's Sword Popular Culture The location features in The Scottish Chiefs.

The complaints were taken to General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) committee and it's 1995 successor; the World Trade Organization (WTO). The case became known as Tuna- Dolphin I, Tuna-Dolphin II and US-Tuna II (Mexico). Complaints concerned the USA embargo on yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna product imports that used purse-seine fishing methods and the labeling there of. Purse-seine fishing has resulted in a high number of dolphin kills.  Background  About 400 tons (360 tonne) of Chilean jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi) are caught by a Chilean purse seiner off of Peru The history of \\"purse-seine\\" net fishing for yellowfin tuna has been the preferred fishing technology of choice for many parts of the world over the last three decades. This type of fishing involves the use of two boats, the primary fishing vessel, and the \\"seine skiff\\" motorboat. Once the school of fish is located, the seine skiff goes out and encircles the school and deploys a net around the perimeter to capture the fish and returns to the main fishing vessel to complete the circle at the end of the net. Once this happens the net is reeled in with cables and the entire contents are gathered into the fishing vessel for processing. The problem with this type of fishing is the indirect catch and killing of many dolphins. This is due to the tendency of these dolphins to swim above schools of yellowfin tuna which occurs in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) Ocean. In fact this tends to be the way that many fishermen will locate schools of tuna, by simply observing the dolphins on the surface. So, the issue becomes that in the ETP many fishermen are intentionally encircling these dolphins in order to get to the tuna below resulting in mass casualties and drowning of dolphins. There are methods however which can reduce this bycatch of dolphins and reduce the mortality rate for these animals. Dolphin casualties in the ETP Ocean have led to the initial ban on tuna imports from Mexico which have been harvested using this controversial purse-seine fishing technique. According to NOAA, since the 1950s there have been approximately 6 million incidental dolphin kills.  Tuna-Dolphin I case  =Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972= The controversy and initial ban by United States on tuna imports from Mexico was based on the \\"taking\\" prohibition in the MMPA (Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972). The MMPA requires a general prohibition on \\"taking\\" and importation into the United States of marine mammals including (harassment, hunting, killing, capture, or any attempts thereof) unless explicitly authorized. The goal of this Act being that reducing incidental kill and injury rates of marine mammals by commercial fishermen. The provisions in the MMPA are applicable to tuna caught in the ETP off the coast of North, Central and South America. Specifically these rules apply to the taking of marine mammals incidental to the harvest of yellowfin tuna as well as the importation of said yellowfin tuna harvested in the ETP. This rule is enforced by the NMFS National Marine Fisheries Service, while the importation is enforced by the United States Custom Service. As clearly stated in Section 101(a)(2) of the MMPA \\"The Secretary of Treasury shall ban the importation of commercial fish or fish products which have been caught with commercial fishing technology which results in the incidental kill or serious injury of ocean mammals in excess of United States standards\\". According to Section 101(a)(2)(B), the importation of yellowtail tuna harvested using purse-seine nets in the ETP is prohibited unless the government of the importing country can show that it has a program comparable to the average rate of taking in United States for reducing marine mammal bycatch. It is on the burden of the country requesting a finding and they must show through documentary evidence that taking rates are comparable. Under Section 101(a)(2)(B) of MMPA there are special prerequisites for determining average incidental taking rates as comparable to those subjected of the United States commercial fleets. The average incidental taking rate (meaning dolphins killed as purse-seine nets are deployed) for any country's tuna fleet may not exceed 1.25 the average taking rate of US vessels in the same period. Furthermore, species of Eastern Spinner Dolphins and coastal spotted dolphins for one year may not exceed 15% and 2% for these species comparable to US fleets. = 1990 US-Mexico tuna embargo = On August 28, 1990 pursuant to court orders, the US government imposes embargo on yellowfin tuna imports harvested with purse-sein netting in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean. This remains in place until the Secretary of commerce can show compliance with MMPA standards. This embargo initially affected Mexico, Venezuela, Vanuatu, Panama and Ecuador. On a revised embargo effective March 26, 1991 yellowfin tuna and other \\"light meat\\" tuna that could potentially contain yellowfin, according to harmonized system tariff headings are prohibited for import unless the importer can provide written evidence that no yellowfin tuna were harvested using purse-seine fishing techniques. This can be tracked by the NOAA Form 370-1 which is required \\"Yellowfin Tuna certificate of origin\\" and it is required to submit by the country of origin. Since Mexico did not want to comply with the new standards of modifying their fishing techniques, no products were accepted from origin of Mexico into the United States. A pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata). Photo courtesy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) = Mexico complaint against MMPA and GATT response = Beginning November 1990, Mexico started to bring the complaint to the US. The complaint then went through GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) dispute resolution system. This became known as the Tuna-Dolphin (I) case. Mexico argued that the US MMPA product ban on tuna imports was inconsistent with the provisions of GATT. Arguing that the ban was inconsistent with Article XI, Article XIII, Article III of GATT. Mexico also claimed that the embargo did not meet the exceptions of Article XX. Article III refers to the National treatment provision and the fact that countries must apply tariffs equally to similar products of all other contracting parties. This also brings to debate the Product vs. process debate. Also known as PPM's (Process and Production Methods), referring to desire of some countries to regulate international trade on like for like goods on the basis of their process technologies or harvesting techniques in this case. Although the intention of the embargo is to bring to light the externalities of dolphin casualties due to the purse- seine harvesting techniques, the issue of PPMs is that the process is irrelevant if the product is the same. Developing countries have historically been wary of including PPM's in the WTO. The fear being that this will create an imposition of environmental, technological and other qualitative standards with high thresholds set by industrialized countries thus creating a technical disadvantage for developing countries. Essentially what Mexico argues is that MMPA is discriminating against like products based on their production methods. Article XI addresses the quantitative restriction provision which involves the dispute over embargoes vs. tariffs. Article XI says that a country is permitted to impose tariffs as a trade restriction but prohibits any type of non-tariff restriction such as quotas or limiting importing/ exporting licenses. Further, Mexico argues the Article XX provision of GATT is inconsistent with that of the MMPA. Specifically Article XX(b) and XX(g) which refer to the allowance of trade restrictions when it is deemed \\"necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health\\" or \\"relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources\\". The issue with Article XX is that even while it may be valid, it cannot be applied outside the jurisdiction of the United States, hence making the argument in the favor of Mexico. The outcome of this challenge fell in the favor of Mexico however these findings were not adopted formally due to the upcoming NAFTA negotiations, however the argument was revisited in the Dolphin Tuna II case in 1992. Tuna-Dolphin II case The GATT Tuna-Dolphin II case was brought against the United States by the European Economic Community (EEC) and the Netherlands in June 1992, who claimed that the U.S. did not have the right to place embargoes on intermediary nations. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) places countries involved in the importation of yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products into the United States, into two separate categories: primary nations and intermediary nations. #Primary nation: a nation that directly exports yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products from its country (i.e. exports to United States) #Intermediary nation: a nation that exports yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products to the United States, and that receives imports, in its country, of yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products that are subject to the primary nation embargo outlined in Section 101(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA. For an intermediary nation, the MMPA requires its government to \\"‚Ä¶certify and provide reasonable proof to the Secretary of Commerce that it has not imported, within the previous six months, any yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products that are subject to a direct ban on importation to the United States.\\" If the intermediary nation cannot provide this proof, then its yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products are banned from importation into the United States. The EEC and the Netherlands argued that this ban violated Articles XI, III, and not supportable by XX of the GATT. =Issues= Article XI and III The EEC and the Netherlands argued that the intermediary nation embargo constituted as a \\"quantitative\\" restriction, and as such, it was in violation of Article XI of the GATT, which clearly forbids the enforcement of any prohibitions or restrictions other than \\"duties, taxes, or charges.\\" With respect to Article III, they claimed that the measures of the intermediary nation embargo could not be considered as \\"the enforcement at the time or point of importation of an internal law, regulation, or requirement which applied equally to the imported product and the like domestic product.\\" The EEC and the Netherlands argued that domestic measure only applied to limiting incidental dolphin mortality, but did not regulate the sale of tuna; whereas, in the case of intermediary nations, the border measure outright banned the importation of tuna if they could not certify that they had not, during the previous six months, imported yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products subject to the primary nation embargo. They based their argument on a note in the GATT report that brought further clarification to the meaning of Article III. It states that, \\"any law, regulation, or requirement‚Ä¶which applies to an imported product and to the like domestic product and is‚Ä¶enforced in the case of the imported product at the time or point of importation, is nevertheless to be regarded as‚Ä¶a law, regulation, or requirement subject to the provisions of Article III. Lastly, the EEC and the Netherlands contended that the note to Article III only pertained to products \\"as such.\\" The ban on tuna being exported from intermediary nations was entirely policy-based, versus product-based. Article XX (g) and (b) The United States argued that regardless of whether its embargo measures violated Articles XI and III, they were covered under Article XX (g) and (b) as measures (1) \\"relating to the conservation of an exhaustible resource,\\" and (2) \\"necessary to protect the life and health of dolphins,\\" respectively. Article XX (g) The EEC and the Netherlands argued that the species needing conservation had to be within the jurisdictional territory of the nation enforcing the measure. In addition, they stated that United States measures were not related to the conservation of an exhaustible natural resource, as they did not consider dolphins as such. Moreover, the EEC and the Netherlands argued that United States measures were not taken in conjunction with \\"domestic restrictions on production or consumption.\\" The United States rebutted by claiming that nowhere in Article XX (g), was there any mention of the resource needing conservation having to be within the jurisdictional territory of the country enforcing the measure. To support its argument, the U.S. cited a previous GATT case \\"U.S.-prohibition of imports of tuna and tuna products from Canada,\\" noting that no such jurisdictional limitation was found, and that the resource being conserved was in fact, outside the jurisdiction of any country. The United States also claimed that its embargo measures were in fact taken in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production and consumption, and that they met the requirement of the preamble to Article XX. Article XX (b) Arguments regarding jurisdictional territory were the same as for Article XX (g). While the EEC and the Netherlands argued that United States measures \\"were not necessary within the meaning of Article XX (b),\\" the United States rebutted, claiming that (1) the measures were necessary to achieve the policy goal of protecting the life and health of dolphins, and (2) they met the requirements of the preamble to Article XX. =Rulings= Articles XI and III For Articles XI and III, the GATT panel ruled in favor of the EEC and the Netherlands. For Article XI, the panel agreed that the United States embargoes on yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna products were in fact \\"prohibitions or restrictions,\\" not \\"duties, taxes, or other charges.\\" For Article III, after reviewing the note to it mentioned above, the panel concluded that this provision could only be applied with respect to a measure which \\"applies to an imported product and to the like domestic product.\\" They also agreed with the EEC and the Netherlands on the fact that Article III's purpose only pertains to the conditions for treatment comparisons between domestic and importing countries' like products, not their policies and practices. Articles XX (g) and (b) For both Articles XX (g) and (b), the panel ruled in favor of the United States with regard to the dispute over jurisdiction. Like the United States, they too, could not find any content with the GATT that alluded to the exhaustible resource needing conservation or protection, having to be within the jurisdictional territory of the country enforcing the measure. Article XX (g) After carefully examining the relationship between United States measures and its goal of dolphin conservation, the panel came to the conclusion that banning the tuna would not in itself conserve the dolphins; only policy changes would, which they felt was not within the original purpose of the GATT. The GATT was only supposed to deal with member states' products, not their processes or policies. Article XX (b) To determine whether United States measures for dolphin protection were \\"necessary,\\" the panel first examined what the meaning of this word meant. The United States argued that necessary meant \\"needed,\\" whereas, the EEC and the Netherland felt it meant \\"indispensable\\" or \\"unavoidable.\\" To support their argument, they referred to a previously adopted panel report which interpreted \\"necessary\\" as meaning \\"no alternative measures\\" exist. The panel also agreed with this interpretation, and felt, once again, that banning yellowfin tuna and tuna products was not a measure that was necessary to protect dolphins; the only way to protect dolphins would be for intermediary nations to change their policies and practices, which was not within the original purpose of the GATT to regulate. Furthermore, the panel felt that banning tuna from primary and intermediary nations, regardless of whether their practices harmed or killed dolphins, but rather based on the fact of whether their practices were comparable to that of the United States, made it seem as if the United States was forcing primary and intermediary nations to adopt its fishing policies; this clearly was never the purpose of the GATT. For these reasons, the panel did not rule in favor of the United States.  Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act  DPCIA, or Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act was an amendment to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 which would support the International Dolphin Conservation Program and management of tuna in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean.Multilateral Agreement Campaign for Eco- Safe Tuna, Retrieved February 21, 2013 Findings by Congress have shown that nations fishing for tuna in the ETP have achieved significant reductions in dolphin mortality by participating countries. This Act lifts the ban on imports from countries that are participating in the IDCP, and reductions have shown to be of great significance from hundreds of thousands of dolphin fatalities, to that of only 5,000 annually.  Dolphin safe labeling  : Under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C 45) it is a violation for any producer, importer, exporter, or seller of any tuna product for sale in the US to include the labeling of \\"dolphin-safe\\" unless it can be clearly shown that this product was harvested under methods not harmful to dolphins. The label does not restrict methods harmful to non-dolphin marine life.U.S. Dolphin-Safe Campaign for Eco-Safe Tuna, Retrieved February 21, 2013 Oversight under this agreement is additionally restricted to vessels using purse-seine nets, which must meet certain requirements in order to be considered \\"dolphin-safe\\": # Vessels cannot harvest tuna in the ETP without an observer on board from the DPCIA certifying that the practices were sound in reducing dolphin mortality # There can be no harvesting on the open seas engaging in driftnet fishing where dolphins are purposely encircled. International Dolphin Conservation Program Act The International Dolphin Conservation Program Act (IDCPA) which was passed August 15, 1997, amended the Dolphin Consumer Information Act of 1990, by changing both the labeling standards and meaning of \\"dolphin safe.\\" It codified the Declaration of Panama, an international agreement signed by Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, France, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Spain, the United States, Vanuatu, and Venezuela. The Declaration established the International Dolphin Conservation Program for purposes of reducing dolphin mortality, while at the same time creating a viable yellowfin tuna harvesting program. The IDCPA allows tuna caught by purse-seine nets, into the United States if there were no observed dolphin mortalities. Lastly, the term \\"dolphin-safe\\" has been modified to mean no dolphin mortalities occurred, instead of banning tuna caught through the use of purse-seine nets. Earth Island vs. Hogarth One of the requirements of the IDCPA was that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) carry out three studies to determine whether dolphins were being harmed by the tuna fisheries. The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) was then required to make an Initial Finding on these fisheries methods by March 31, 1999, and a Final Finding by December 31, 2002. As required, the Secretary released his Initial Findings in 1999, in which he determined that the fishery was not having any adverse effects on dolphin populations. Upset with the lack of scientific evidence in the report to support this claim, several environmental organizations sued NMFS. The district court granted summary judgment and vacated the Initial Finding. When NMFS appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit, the court affirmed the district court's decision, maintaining that the requirement for the agency was to \\"reach a definitive answer, not a \\"default finding\\" based on the lack of evidence. In 2002, NMFS released its Final Finding, once again, concluding that the fishery was not having any impacts on dolphin populations. In response, Earth Island and a number of other environmental organizations sued the agency once again. The district court ruled in favor of Earth Island, stating in the end that Final Finding was \\"arbitrary and capricious,\\" based on the fact that (1) NMFS did not carry out the studies required by the MMPA, (2) considering the best available evidence, the agency's \\"no adverse impact\\" finding was implausible, and (3) the court found there to be evidence of \\"political meddling.\\" Upon NMFS's appeal to the Ninth Circuit, after reviewing the legal grounds on which the district court based their decision, the court found that NMFS had inadequately conducted two of the three studies. Because of this, the court vacated the Secretary's Final Finding. US- Tuna II (Mexico) Starting 2008, Mexico raised complaints with the World Trade Organization's (WTO) about United States import restrictions and use of dolphin safe labeling on Tuna products. It was taken to the body's dispute settle system and the case was given the short title US-Tuna II (Mexico) and case number DS381. Mexico argued, that US conditions for \\"dolphin-safe\\" labeling were \\"discriminatory and unnecessary,\\" and that they violated Articles 2.1, 2.2, and 2.4 of the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). For Article 2.1, the panel rejected Mexico's claims that U.S. dolphin-safe labeling measures discriminated against Mexican tuna products. For Article 2.4, ruled in favor of the U.S., concluding that its dolphin-safe labeling was not in violation of Article 2.4, which requires \\"technical regulations to be based on relevant international standards where possible.\\" For Article 2.4, however, the panel did agree with Mexico that the United States dolphin-safe labeling measures were more trade restrictive than necessary to achieve their objectives. The United States and Mexico both appealed. Two reports were issued on the discriminatory aspects of the US legislation regarding dolphin-safe labels. The WTO Panel Report was published on 15 September 2011 and the WTO's Appellate Body Report was published on 16 May 2012. The US government has strongly opposed these decisions and continues to improve the Dolphin Safe implementation procedures to expand provisions in keeping with the WTO concerns without weakening the Dolphin Safe label standards. On November 20, 2015, the WTO Appellate Body ruled against the United States. The US strongly opposes the claims by the WTO, noting that US Dolphin Safe standards provide more protection to dolphins than other weaker standards promoted by the government of Mexico and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (mainly concerned with promoting tuna fishing) and that the US has strengthened review of Dolphin Safe tuna in other areas of the world. Hundreds of environmental organizations condemned the WTO for putting support for free trade over environmental considerations, such as protection of dolphins. In January 2019, the WTO ruled in favor of the US that the labelling was compliant and consistent with WTO rules.

Early life and career James Talboys Wheeler was born in Oxford 22 or 23 December 1824. His parents were James Luft Wheeler, who was a bookseller, and Anne Ophelia, whose father was the publisher and translator David Alphonso Talboys and himself the son of a bookseller. James was privately educated and then attempted an unsuccessful career as a publisher and bookseller before venturing into authorship of student handbooks. He worked for Henry George Bohn as a sub-editor, between 1845 and 1847, and spent some time working as a clerk in the War Office during the Crimean War. Career abroad In 1858, he determined to develop his literary talents by becoming editor of the Madras Spectator in India. Later in that year he was appointed professor of moral and mental philosophy at Madras Presidency College, and during his four years in that position his interest in Hindu customs was piqued as a consequence of his contact with Indian students. He believed that the Europeans in India were largely ignorant of the Hindu perspective on family life. Wheeler developed his interests to become, in the words of S. C. Mittal, a \\"bureaucrat-historian\\", of whom William Wilson Hunter and Alfred Comyn Lyall are other examples. In 1860, while still holding his chair at the College, he was employed by the Raj government in Madras, from which came his Madras in the Olden Time, a history based on government records that was published in 1861, and was based at least in part on columns previously published by the Indian Statesman. In the following year he moved to Calcutta as an Assistant Secretary in the Foreign Department, and in 1867 he was appointed Secretary to the Records Commission as an official appreciation of his works. While holding these two offices, he produced various summary reports relating to the history and politics of countries that bordered on British India for the government, and also some memoranda on topics such as vernacular literature and the amirs of Sindh that were well received. He also engaged himself, in his leisure time, with the compilation of his four-volume History of India, which was published between 1867 and 1881. This is sometimes described as a five-volume work: the last volume of the series was published in two parts. In 1870 he moved to Rangoon in Burma, where he held office as Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of British Burma. According to Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB), in an article originally written in 1899 by Stephen Wheeler and later revised by David Washbrook in 2004, he had a three-year furlough in England between 1873 and 1876 and then returned to Calcutta, where he produced further reports based on records held by government departments and also an official history of the Imperial Assemblage (the Delhi Durbar) that took place in 1877. He was given permission to publish these later works, which had not been the case with his earlier official reports, he was \\"one of the first historians of British India to rely primarily on documentary sources. Although his perspectives were unequivocally imperialist, his work continues to be consulted for its empirical strengths.\\" Mittal agrees with the ODNB, saying that Wheeler was However, Mittal's description of his career post-1870 differs considerably, claiming that Wheeler was occupied in Burma until 1879. There he failed to win the approval that he had enjoyed in India, possibly because he lacked basic administrative experience and possibly because of failing health due to \\"intemperance\\". He was pensioned off early, in 1879, and his subsequent proposals to produce summaries of official records were disregarded. The government also denied his request in 1888 for financial recognition, in the form of a grant or pension, for his efforts in producing the History of India series. Death In contradiction to Mittal, the ODNB says that Wheeler retired in 1891. He died in Ramsgate on 13 January 1897. He had married Emily Roe on 15 January 1852, in Cambridge, and the couple had several children.

In addition to the mainland grizzly (Ursus arctos horribilis), other morphological forms of brown bear in North America are sometimes identified as grizzly bears. These include two living populations ‚Äî the Kodiak bear (U. a. middendorffi) and the peninsular grizzly (U. a. gyas) ‚Äî as well as the extinct California grizzly (U. a. californicus‚Ä†), Mexican grizzly (U. a. nelsoni‚Ä†), and Ungava-Labrador grizzly (U. a. ungavaesis‚Ä†). On average, grizzly bears near the coast tend to be larger while inland grizzlies tend to be smaller. The Ussuri brown bear (U. a. lasiotus), inhabiting Russia, Northern China, Japan, and Korea, is sometimes referred to as the \\"black grizzly\\", although it is no more closely related to North American brown bears than other subspecies of brown bear around the world. Classification =Meaning of \\"grizzly\\"= Meriwether Lewis and William Clark first described it as grisley, which could be interpreted as either \\"grizzly\\" (i.e., \\"grizzled\\"‚Äîthat is, with grey-tipped hair) or \\"grisly\\" (\\"fear-inspiring\\", now usually \\"gruesome\\"). The modern spelling supposes the former meaning; even so, naturalist George Ord formally classified it in 1815 as U. horribilis, not for its hair, but for its character. =Evolution and genetics= Phylogenetics Classification has been revised along genetic lines. There are two morphological forms of Ursus arctos: the grizzly and the coastal brown bears, but these morphological forms do not have distinct mtDNA lineages. Ursus arctos Brown bears originated in Eurasia and traveled to North America approximately 50,000 years ago, spreading into the contiguous United States about 13,000 years ago. The genome of the grizzly bear was sequenced in 2018 and found to be 2,328.64Mb (mega- basepairs) in length, and contain 30,387 genes. In the 19th century, the grizzly was classified as 86 distinct species. However, by 1928 only seven grizzly species remained, and by 1953 only one species remained globally. However, modern genetic testing reveals the grizzly to be a subspecies of the brown bear (Ursus arctos). Rausch found that North America has but one species of grizzly. Therefore, everywhere it is the \\"brown bear\\"; in North America, it is the \\"grizzly\\", but these are all the same species, Ursus arctos. Subspecies in North America In 1963 Rausch reduced the number of North American subspecies to one, Ursus arctos middendorffi. Further testing of Y-chromosomes is required to yield an accurate new taxonomy with different subspecies. Coastal grizzlies, often referred to by the popular but geographically redundant synonym of \\"brown bear\\" or \\"Alaskan brown bear\\" are larger and darker than inland grizzlies, which is why they, too, were considered a different species from grizzlies. Kodiak grizzly bears were also at one time considered distinct. Therefore, at one time there were five different \\"species\\" of brown bear, including three in North America.Grizz: Of Men and the Great Bear. National Geographic Article, February 1986. Douglas H.

Range and population Alaskan grizzly in Katmai National Park with partially eaten salmon ‚Äì the heads, skin and subcutaneous tissue are eaten to obtain the most fat Brown bears are found in Asia, Europe, and North America, giving them the widest ranges of bear species. They also inhabited North Africa and the Middle East. In North America, grizzly bears previously ranged from Alaska down to Mexico and as far east as the western shores of Hudson Bay; the species is now found in Alaska, south through much of western Canada, and into portions of the northwestern United States (including Washington, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming), extending as far south as Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. In Canada, there are approximately 25,000 grizzly bears occupying British Columbia, Alberta, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and the northern part of Manitoba. An article published in 1954 suggested they may be present in the tundra areas of the Ungava Peninsula and the northern tip of Labrador-Quebec. In British Columbia, grizzly bears inhabit approximately 90% of their original territory. There were approximately 25,000 grizzly bears in British Columbia when the European settlers arrived. However, population size has since significantly decreased due to hunting and habitat loss. In 2003, researchers from the University of Alberta spotted a grizzly on Melville Island in the high Arctic, which is the most northerly sighting ever documented. In 2008, it was estimated there were 16,014 grizzly bears. Population estimates for British Columbia are based on hair-snagging, DNA- based inventories, mark-and-recapture, and a refined multiple regression model. A revised Grizzly bear count in 2012 for British Columbia was 15,075. The Alaskan population of 30,000 individuals is the highest population of any province / state in North America. Populations in Alaska are densest along the coast, where food supplies such as salmon are more abundant. The Admiralty Island National Monument protects the densest population: 1,600 bears on a 1,600 square-mile island. =North America= Glacier National Park, Montana, United States There are currently about 55,000 wild grizzly bears located throughout North America, 30,000 of which are found in Alaska. Only around 1,500 grizzlies remain in the lower 48 United States. Of these, around 800 are found in Montana. About 600 more live in Wyoming, in the Yellowstone-Teton area. There are an estimated 70‚Äì100 grizzly bears living in northern and eastern Idaho. Its original range included much of the Great Plains and the southwestern states, but it has been extirpated in most of those areas. Combining Canada and the United States, grizzly bears inhabit approximately half the area of their historical range. Although the once-abundant California grizzly bear appears prominently on the state flag of California and was the symbol of the Bear Flag Republic before California's admission to the Union in 1850, they are no longer naturally found there. The last known grizzlies in California were killed in the Sierra foothills east of Fresno in the early 1920s. Aldo Leopold's Sand County Almanac includes a discussion of the killing of the last grizzly bear in Arizona (in 1936 https://themtsarecalling.com/escudilla/) at Escudilla Mountain. In September 2007, a hunter produced evidence of one bear in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness ecosystem, by killing a male grizzly bear there. In the North Cascades ecosystem of northern Washington, grizzly bear populations are estimated to be fewer than 20 bears. One sighting of a grizzly bear in 2010 has been recorded. There has been no confirmed sighting of a grizzly in Colorado since 1979. Other provinces and the United States may use a combination of methods for population estimates. Therefore, it is difficult to say precisely what methods were used to produce total population estimates for Canada and North America, as they were likely developed from a variety of studies. The grizzly bear currently has legal protection in Mexico, European countries, some areas of Canada, and in all of the United States. However, it is expected that repopulating its former range will be a slow process, due to a variety of reasons including the bear's slow reproductive habits and the effects of reintroducing such a large animal to areas prized for agriculture and livestock. Competition with other predators and predation on cubs are other possible limiting factors for grizzly bear recovery, though grizzly bears also benefit from scavenged carcasses from predators as an easy food source when other food sources decline. Biology =Hibernation= Grizzly bears hibernate for 5‚Äì7 months each year except where the climate is warm, as the California grizzly did not hibernate. During this time, female grizzly bears give birth to their offspring, who then consume milk from their mother and gain strength for the remainder of the hibernation period. To prepare for hibernation, grizzlies must prepare a den, and consume an immense amount of food as they do not eat during hibernation. Grizzly bears do not defecate or urinate throughout the entire hibernation period. The male grizzly bear's hibernation ends in early to mid-March, while females emerge in April or early May. In preparation for winter, bears can gain approximately , during a period of hyperphagia, before going into hibernation. The bear often waits for a substantial snowstorm before it enters its den: such behavior lessens the chances predators will find the den. The dens are typically at elevations above on north-facing slopes. There is some debate amongst professionals as to whether grizzly bears technically hibernate: much of this debate revolves around body temperature and the ability of the bears to move around during hibernation on occasion. Grizzly bears can \\"partially\\" recycle their body wastes during this period. Although inland or Rocky Mountain grizzlies spend nearly half of their life in dens, coastal grizzlies with better access to food sources spend less time in dens. In some areas where food is very plentiful year round, grizzly bears skip hibernation altogether. =Reproduction= Sow with two cubs in Kananaskis Country Except for females with cubs,Grizzly Bears, Grizzly Bear Pictures, Grizzly Bear Facts ‚Äì National Geographic. Animals.nationalgeographic.com. Retrieved 17 August 2012. grizzlies are normally solitary, active animals, but in coastal areas, grizzlies gather around streams, lakes, rivers, and ponds during the salmon spawn. Females (sows) produce one to four young (usually two) that are small and weigh only about at birth. A sow is protective of her offspring and will attack if she thinks she or her cubs are threatened. Grizzly bears have one of the lowest reproductive rates of all terrestrial mammals in North America. This is due to numerous ecological factors. Grizzly bears do not reach sexual maturity until they are at least five years old. Once mated with a male in the summer, the female delays embryo implantation until hibernation, during which miscarriage can occur if the female does not receive the proper nutrients and caloric intake. On average, females produce two cubs in a litter and the mother cares for the cubs for up to two years, during which the mother will not mate. Mother grizzly with a cub Once the young leave or are killed, females may not produce another litter for three or more years, depending on environmental conditions. Male grizzly bears have large territories, up to , making finding a female scent difficult in such low population densities. Population fragmentation of grizzlies may destabilize the population from inbreeding depression. The gestation period for grizzly bears is approximately 180‚Äì250 days. Litter size is between one and four cubs, averaging twins or triplets. Cubs are always born in the mother's winter den while she is in hibernation. Female grizzlies are fiercely protective of their cubs, being able to fend off predators as large as male bears bigger than they are in defence of the cubs. Cubs feed entirely on their mother's milk until summer comes, after which they still drink milk but begin to eat solid foods. Cubs gain weight rapidly during their time with the mother‚Äîtheir weight will have increased from in the two years spent with the mother. Mothers may see their cubs in later years but both avoid each other. =Longevity= The average lifespan for a male is estimated at 22 years, with that of a female being slightly longer at 26. Females live longer than males due to their less dangerous life; they do not engage in seasonal breeding fights as males do. The oldest wild inland grizzly was 34 years old in Alaska; the oldest coastal bear was 39,Brown, Gary. The Great Bear Almanac. Guilford, CT, 1993, pg. 91. but most grizzlies die in their first few years of life from predation or hunting. Captive grizzlies have lived as long as 44 years. Ecology =Diet= Although grizzlies are of the order Carnivora and have the digestive system of carnivores, they are normally omnivores: their diets consist of both plants and animals. They have been known to prey on large mammals, when available, such as moose, elk, caribou, white-tailed deer, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bison, and even black bears; though they are more likely to take calves and injured individuals rather than healthy adults. Grizzly bears feed on fish such as salmon, trout, and bass, and those with access to a more protein-enriched diet in coastal areas potentially grow larger than inland individuals. Grizzly bears also readily scavenge food or carrion left behind by other animals. Grizzly bears will also eat birds and their eggs, and gather in large numbers at fishing sites to feed on spawning salmon. They frequently prey on baby deer left in the grass, and occasionally they raid the nests of raptors such as bald eagles. Canadian or Alaskan grizzlies are larger than those that reside in the American Rocky Mountains. This is due, in part, to the richness of their diets. In Yellowstone National Park in the United States, the grizzly bear's diet consists mostly of whitebark pine nuts, tubers, grasses, various rodents, army cutworm moths, and scavenged carcasses. None of these, however, match the fat content of the salmon available in Alaska and British Columbia. With the high fat content of salmon, it is not uncommon to encounter grizzlies in Alaska weighing . Grizzlies in Alaska supplement their diet of salmon and clams with sedge grass and berries. In areas where salmon are forced to leap waterfalls, grizzlies gather at the base of the falls to feed on and catch the fish. Salmon are at a disadvantage when they leap waterfalls because they cluster together at their bases and are therefore easier targets for the grizzlies. Grizzly bears are well-documented catching leaping salmon in their mouths at Brooks Falls in Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska. They are also very experienced in chasing the fish around and pinning them with their claws. At such sites such as Brooks Falls and McNeil Falls in Alaska, big male grizzlies fight regularly for the best fishing spots. Grizzly bears along the coast also forage for razor clams, and frequently dig into the sand to seek them. During the spring and fall, directly before and after the salmon runs, berries and grass make up the mainstay of the diets of coastal grizzlies. Grizzly fishing for salmon at Brooks Falls, Alaska Inland grizzlies may eat fish too, most notably in Yellowstone grizzlies eating Yellowstone cutthroat trout. The relationship with cutthroat trout and grizzlies is unique because it is the only example where Rocky Mountain grizzlies feed on spawning salmonid fish. However, grizzly bears themselves and invasive lake trout threaten the survival of the trout population and there is a slight chance that the trout will be eliminated. Meat, as already described, is an important part of a grizzly's diet. Grizzly bears occasionally prey on small mammals, such as marmots, ground squirrels, lemmings, and voles. The most famous example of such predation is in Denali National Park and Preserve, where grizzlies chase, pounce on, and dig up Arctic ground squirrels to eat. In some areas, grizzly bears prey on hoary marmots, overturning rocks to reach them, and in some cases preying on them when they are in hibernation.Whitaker, John O. (1980) The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mammals. Chanticleer Press, New York, p. 388. . Larger prey includes bison and moose, which are sometimes taken by bears in Yellowstone National Park. Because bison and moose are dangerous prey, grizzlies usually use cover to stalk them and/or pick off weak individuals or calves. Grizzlies in Alaska also regularly prey on moose calves, which in Denali National Park may be their main source of meat. In fact, grizzly bears are such important predators of moose and elk calves in Alaska and in Yellowstone, that they may kill as many as 51 percent of elk or moose calves born that year. Grizzly bears have also been blamed in the decline of elk in Yellowstone National Park when the actual predators were thought to be gray wolves. In northern Alaska, grizzlies are a significant predator of caribou, mostly taking sick or old individuals or calves. Several studies show that grizzly bears may follow the caribou herds year-round in order to maintain their food supply. In northern Alaska, grizzly bears often encounter muskox. Despite the fact that muskox do not usually occur in grizzly habitat and that they are bigger and more powerful than caribou, predation on muskox by grizzlies has been recorded. Grizzlies along the Alaskan coast also scavenge on dead or washed up whales. Usually such incidents involve only one or two grizzlies at a carcass, but up to ten large males have been seen at a time eating a dead humpback whale. Dead seals and sea lions are also consumed. Although the diets of grizzly bears vary extensively based on seasonal and regional changes, plants make up a large portion of them, with some estimates as high as 80‚Äì90%. Various berries constitute an important food source when they are available. These can include blueberries, blackberries (Rubus fruticosus), salmon berries (Rubus spectabilis), cranberries (Vaccinium oxycoccos), buffalo berries (Shepherdia argentea), soapberries (Shepherdia canadensis), and huckleberries (Vaccinium parvifolium), depending on the environment. Insects such as ladybugs, ants, and bees are eaten if they are available in large quantities. In Yellowstone National Park, grizzly bears may obtain half of their yearly caloric needs by feeding on miller moths that congregate on mountain slopes. When food is abundant, grizzly bears will feed in groups. For example, many grizzly bears will visit meadows right after an avalanche or glacier slide. This is due to an influx of legumes, such as Hedysarum, which the grizzlies consume in massive amounts. When food sources become scarcer, however, they separate once again. White-grey cub in Western Canada =Interspecific competition= The relationship between grizzly bears and other predators is mostly one-sided; grizzly bears will approach feeding predators to steal their kill. In general, the other species will leave the carcasses for the bear to avoid competition or predation. Any parts of the carcass left uneaten are scavenged by smaller animals. Grizzlies and wolves With the reintroduction of gray wolves to Yellowstone, many visitors have witnessed a once common struggle between a keystone species, the grizzly bear, and its historic rival, the gray wolf. The interactions of grizzly bears with the wolves of Yellowstone have been under considerable study. Typically, the conflict will be in the defence of young or over a carcass, which is commonly an elk killed by wolves. The grizzly bear uses its keen sense of smell to locate the kill. As the wolves and grizzly compete for the kill, one wolf may try to distract the bear while the others feed. The bear then may retaliate by chasing the wolves. If the wolves become aggressive with the bear, it is normally in the form of quick nips at its hind legs. Thus, the bear will sit down and use its ability to protect itself in a full circle. Rarely do interactions such as these end in death or serious injury to either animal. One carcass simply is not usually worth the risk to the wolves (if the bear has the upper hand due to strength and size) or to the bear (if the wolves are too numerous or persistent). While wolves usually dominate grizzly bears during interactions at wolf dens, both grizzly and black bears have been reported killing wolves and their cubs at wolf dens even when the wolves were acting in defence. Grizzlies and big cats Cougars generally give the bears a wide berth. Grizzlies have less competition with cougars than with other predators, such as coyotes, wolves, and other bears. When a grizzly descends on a cougar feeding on its kill, the cougar usually gives way to the bear. When a cougar does stand its ground, it will use its superior agility and its claws to harass the bear, yet stay out of its reach until one of them gives up. Grizzly bears occasionally kill cougars in disputes over kills. There have been several anecdotes, primarily from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, of cougars and grizzly bears killing each other in fights to the death. The other big cat present in the United States which might pose as a threat to bears, is the jaguar; however, both species have been extirpated in the regions of the Southwest where their former habitats overlapped, and grizzlies remain far absent from the regions along the U.S.-Mexico border, where jaguars appear to be returning. Grizzlies and black bears black bear hybrid in Yukon Territory, Canada Black bears generally stay out of grizzly territory, but grizzlies may occasionally enter black bear terrain to obtain food sources both bears enjoy, such as pine nuts, acorns, mushrooms, and berries. When a black bear sees a grizzly coming, it either turns tail and runs or climbs a tree. Black bears are not strong competition for prey because they have a more herbivorous diet. Confrontations are rare because of the differences in size, habitats, and diets of the bear species. When this happens, it is usually with the grizzly being the aggressor. The black bear will only fight when it is a smaller grizzly such as a yearling or when the black bear has no other choice but to defend itself. There is at least one confirmed observation of a grizzly bear digging out, killing, and eating a black bear when the latter was in hibernation. The segregation of black bear and grizzly bear populations is possibly due to competitive exclusion. In certain areas, grizzly bears outcompete black bears for the same resources. For example, many Pacific coastal islands off British Columbia and Alaska support either the black bear or the grizzly, but rarely both. In regions where both species coexist, they are divided by landscape gradients such as age of forest, elevation and openness of land. Grizzly bears tend to favor old forests with high productivity, higher elevations and more open habitats compared with black bears. However, a bear shot in autumn 1986 in Michigan was thought by some to be a grizzly√óblack bear hybrid, due to its unusually large size and its proportionately larger braincase and skull, but DNA testing was unable to determine whether it was a large American black bear or a grizzly bear. Grizzlies and various small predators Coyotes, foxes, and wolverines are generally regarded merely as pests to grizzlies rather than competition, though they may compete for smaller prey, such as ground squirrels and rabbits. All three will try to scavenge whatever they can from the bears. Wolverines are aggressive enough to occasionally persist until the bear finishes eating, leaving more scraps than normal for the smaller animal. Packs of coyotes have also displaced grizzly bears in disputes over kills. The removal of wolves and grizzlies in California may have greatly reduced the abundance of the endangered San Joaquin Kit Fox. =Ecological role= The grizzly bear has several relationships with its ecosystem. One such relationship is a mutualistic relationship with fleshy-fruit bearing plants. After the grizzly consumes the fruit, the seeds are excreted and thereby dispersed in a germinable condition. Some studies have shown germination success is indeed increased as a result of seeds being deposited along with nutrients in feces. This makes grizzly bears important seed distributors in their habitats. While foraging for tree roots, plant bulbs, or ground squirrels, bears stir up the soil. This process not only helps grizzlies access their food, but also increases species richness in alpine ecosystems. An area that contains both bear digs and undisturbed land has greater plant diversity than an area that contains just undisturbed land. Along with increasing species richness, soil disturbance causes nitrogen to be dug up from lower soil layers, and makes nitrogen more readily available in the environment. An area that has been dug by the grizzly bear has significantly more nitrogen than an undisturbed area. Nitrogen cycling is not only facilitated by grizzlies digging for food, it is also accomplished via their habit of carrying salmon carcasses into surrounding forests. It has been found that spruce tree (Picea glauca) foliage within of the stream where the salmon have been obtained contains nitrogen originating from salmon on which the bears preyed. These nitrogen influxes to the forest are directly related to the presence of grizzly bears and salmon. Grizzlies directly regulate prey populations and also help prevent overgrazing in forests by controlling the populations of other species in the food chain. An experiment in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in the United States showed removal of wolves and grizzly bears caused populations of their herbivorous prey to increase. This, in turn, changed the structure and density of plants in the area, which decreased the population sizes of migratory birds. This provides evidence grizzly bears represent a keystone predator, having a major influence on the entire ecosystem they inhabit. When grizzly bears fish for salmon along the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia, they often only eat the skin, brain and roe of the fish. In doing so, they provide a food source for gulls, ravens, and foxes, all of which eat salmon as well; this benefits both the bear and the smaller predators. Interaction with humans =Relationship with Native Americans= Gorgonia, a Native American (Mescalero Apache) man. He holds a bear pelt and wears moccasin boots, a breechcloth, kilt, and vest Native American tribes sympatric with brown bears often view them with a mixture of awe and fear. North American brown bears have at times been so feared by the Natives that they were rarely hunted by them, especially when alone. At traditional grizzly hunts in some western tribes such as the Gwich‚Äôin, the expedition was conducted with the same preparation and ceremoniality as intertribal warfare and was never done except with a company of four to 10 warriors. The tribe members who dealt the killing blow were highly esteemed among their compatriots. Californian Natives actively avoided prime bear habitat and would not allow their young men to hunt alone for fear of bear attacks. During the Spanish colonial period, some tribes, instead of hunting grizzlies themselves, would seek aid from European colonists to deal with problem bears. Many authors in the American West wrote of Natives or voyageurs with lacerated faces and missing noses or eyes, due to attacks from grizzlies. Many Native American tribes both respect and fear the brown bear. In Kwakiutl mythology, American black and brown bears became enemies when Grizzly Bear Woman killed Black Bear Woman for being lazy. Black Bear Woman's children, in turn, killed Grizzly Bear Woman's own cubs. Sleeping Bear Dunes is named after an Ojibwe legend, where a female bear and her cubs swam across Lake Michigan. According to the legend, the two cubs drowned and became the Manitou islands. The mother bear eventually got to shore and slept, waiting patiently for her cubs to arrive. Over the years, the sand covered the mother bear up, creating a huge sand dune. =Conflicts with humans= Grizzlies are considered more aggressive compared to black bears when defending themselves and their offspring. Unlike the smaller black bears, adult grizzlies do not climb trees well, and respond to danger by standing their ground and warding off their attackers. Mothers defending cubs are the most prone to attacking, and are responsible for 70% of humans killed by grizzlies.How Dangerous are Black Bears . Bear.org. Retrieved 17 August 2012. Grizzly bears normally avoid contact with people. In spite of their obvious physical advantage they rarely actively hunt humans.Ministry of Environment. 2002. Grizzly Bears in British Columbia . Retrieved 12 October 2009. Most grizzly bear attacks result from a bear that has been surprised at very close range, especially if it has a supply of food to protect, or female grizzlies protecting their offspring. A bear killing a human in a national park may be killed to prevent its attacking again. Hugh Glass being attacked by a grizzly bear, from an early newspaper illustration of unknown origin Exacerbating this is the fact that intensive human use of grizzly habitat coincides with the seasonal movement of grizzly bears. Increased human‚Äìbear interaction has created \\"problem bears\\": bears adapted to human activities or habitat.Austin, M. A., Wrenshall, C. (2004).

Aversive conditioning using rubber bullets, foul-tasting chemicals, or acoustic deterrent devices attempt to condition bears to associate humans with unpleasantness, but is ineffectual when bears have already learned to positively associate humans with food. Such bears are translocated or killed because they pose a threat to humans. The B.C. government kills approximately 50 problem bears each year and overall spends more than one million dollars annually to address bear complaints, relocate bears or kill them. Bear awareness programs have been developed by numerous towns in British Columbia, Canada, to help prevent conflicts with both black and grizzly bears. The main premise of these programs is to teach humans to manage foods that attract bears. Keeping garbage securely stored, harvesting fruit when ripe, securing livestock behind electric fences, and storing pet food indoors are all measures promoted by bear awareness programs. The fact that grizzly bears are less numerous and even protected in some areas, means that preventing conflict with grizzlies is especially important. Revelstoke, British Columbia is a community that demonstrates the success of this approach. In the ten years preceding the development of a community education program in Revelstoke, 16 grizzlies were destroyed and a further 107 were relocated away from the town. An education program run by Revelstoke Bear Aware was put in place in 1996. Since the program began just four grizzlies have been eliminated and five have been relocated.\\"Revelstoke Bear Aware Annual Report ‚Äì 2015\\" ‚Äì Sue Davies, Community Coordinator url=http://revelstokebearaware.org/about-us/documents/ For back-country campers, hanging food between trees at a height unreachable to bears is a common procedure, although some grizzlies can climb and reach hanging food in other ways. An alternative to hanging food is to use a bear canister. Traveling in groups of six or more can significantly reduce the chance of bear-related injuries while hiking in bear country. Grizzly bears are especially dangerous because of the force of their bite, which has been measured at over 8 megapascals (1160 psi). It has been estimated that a bite from a grizzly could even crush a bowling ball.Facts: Casey & Brutus: Grizzly Encounters ‚Äì National Geographic Channel ‚Äì UK. Natgeotv.com (2010-04-20). Retrieved 29 August 2013. =Protection= A grizzly in Denali National Park The grizzly bear is listed as threatened in the contiguous United States and endangered in parts of Canada. In May 2002, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the Prairie population (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba range) of grizzly bears as extirpated in Canada. As of 2002, grizzly bears were listed as special concern under the COSEWIC registry and considered threatened under the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Within the United States, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concentrates its effort to restore grizzly bears in six recovery areas. These are Northern Continental Divide (Montana), Yellowstone (Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho), Cabinet-Yaak (Montana and Idaho), Selway- Bitterroot (Montana and Idaho), Selkirk (Idaho and Washington), and North Cascades (Washington). The grizzly population in these areas is estimated at 750 in the Northern Continental Divide, 550 in Yellowstone, 40 in the Yaak portion of the Cabinet-Yaak, and 15 in the Cabinet portion (in northwestern Montana), 105 in Selkirk region of Idaho, 10‚Äì20 in the North Cascades, and none currently in Selway-Bitterroots, although there have been sightings.Knibb, David (2008) Grizzly Wars: The Public Fight Over the Great Bear, Eastern Washington University Press, pp. 164‚Äì213, . These are estimates because bears move in and out of these areas, and it is therefore impossible to conduct a precise count. In the recovery areas that adjoin Canada, bears also move back and forth across the international boundary. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service claims the Cabinet-Yaak and Selkirk areas are linked through British Columbia, a claim that is disputed.Knibb, David (2008) Grizzly Wars: The Public Fight Over the Great Bear, Eastern Washington University Press, pp. 202‚Äì204, . U.S. and Canadian national parks, such as Banff National Park, Yellowstone and Grand Teton, and Theodore Roosevelt National Park are subject to laws and regulations designed to protect the bears. BC Park warns campers to hang food, garbage, and toiletries out of reach of bears, or to use a secure bear cache On 9 January 2006, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to remove Yellowstone grizzlies from the list of threatened and protected species. In March 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \\"de- listed\\" the population, effectively removing Endangered Species Act protections for grizzlies in the Yellowstone National Park area. Several environmental organizations, including the NRDC, brought a lawsuit against the federal government to relist the grizzly bear. On 22 September 2009, U.S. District Judge Donald W. Molloy reinstated protection due to the decline of whitebark pine tree, whose nuts are an important source of food for the bears. The bears were again removed from protection by the Trump administration in 2017. It was argued that the population had sufficiently recovered from the threat of extinction, however numerous conservation and tribal organizations argued that the grizzly population remained genetically vulnerable. They successfully sued the administration (Crow Tribe et al v. Zinke) and on July 30, 2019, the Yellowstone grizzly was officially returned to federal protection. Farther north, in Alberta, Canada, intense DNA hair-snagging studies in 2000 showed the grizzly population to be increasing faster than what it was formerly believed to be, and Alberta Sustainable Resource Development calculated a population of 841 bears. In 2002, the Endangered Species Conservation Committee recommended that the Alberta grizzly bear population be designated as threatened due to recent estimates of grizzly bear mortality rates that indicated the population was in decline. A recovery plan released by the provincial government in March 2008 indicated the grizzly population is lower than previously believed. In 2010, the provincial government formally listed its population of about 700 grizzlies as \\"Threatened\\".Alberta designates grizzly bears a threatened species. Alberta.ca (2010-06-03). Retrieved 5 August 2013. Environment Canada consider the grizzly bear to a \\"special concern\\" species, as it is particularly sensitive to human activities and natural threats. In Alberta and British Columbia, the species is considered to be at risk. In 2008, it was estimated there were 16,014 grizzly bears in the British Columbia population, which was lower than previously estimated due to refinements in the population model. The Mexican grizzly bear (Ursus arctos nelsoni) is extinct. =Conservation efforts= Drum or barrel trap, used to safely relocate bears, adjacent to a building in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, United States Taxidermied specimens at the American Museum of Natural History Conservation efforts have become an increasingly vital investment over recent decades, as population numbers have dramatically declined. Establishment of parks and protected areas are one of the main focuses currently being tackled to help reestablish the low grizzly bear population in British Columbia. One example of these efforts is the Khutzeymateen Grizzly Bear Sanctuary located along the north coast of British Columbia; at in size, it is composed of key habitat for this threatened species. Regulations such as limited public access, as well as a strict no hunting policy, have enabled this location to be a safe haven for local grizzlies in the area. When choosing the location of a park focused on grizzly bear conservation, factors such as habitat quality and connectivity to other habitat patches are considered. The Refuge for Endangered Wildlife located on Grouse Mountain in Vancouver is an example of a different type of conservation effort for the diminishing grizzly bear population. The refuge is a five-acre terrain which has functioned as a home for two orphaned grizzly bears since 2001. The purpose of this refuge is to provide awareness and education to the public about grizzly bears, as well as providing an area for research and observation of this secluded species. Another factor currently being taken into consideration when designing conservation plans for future generations are anthropogenic barriers in the form of urban development and roads. These elements are acting as obstacles, causing fragmentation of the remaining grizzly bear population habitat and prevention of gene flow between subpopulations (for example, Banff National Park). This, in turn, is creating a decline in genetic diversity, and therefore the overall fitness of the general population is lowered. In light of these issues, conservation plans often include migration corridors by way of long strips of \\"park forest\\" to connect less developed areas, or by way of tunnels and overpasses over busy roads. Using GPS collar tracking, scientists can study whether or not these efforts are actually making a positive contribution towards resolving the problem. To date, most corridors are found to be infrequently used, and thus genetic isolation is currently occurring, which can result in inbreeding and therefore an increased frequency of deleterious genes through genetic drift. Current data suggest female grizzly bears are disproportionately less likely than males to use these corridors, which can prevent mate access and decrease the number of offspring. In the United States, national efforts have been made since 1982 for the recovery plan of grizzly bears. A lot of the efforts made have been through different organizations efforts to educate the public on grizzly bear safety, habits of grizzly bears and different ways to reduce human-bear conflict. The Interagency Grizzly Bear Recovery Committee is one of many organizations committed to the recovery of grizzly bears in the lower 48 states. There are five recovery zones for grizzly bears in the lower 48 states including the North Cascades ecosystem in Washington state. The National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife initiated the process of an environmental impact statement that started in the fall of 2014 to begin the recovery process of grizzly bears to the North Cascades region. A final plan and environmental impact statement was released in the spring of 2017 with a record of decision to follow. In early March 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to withdraw Endangered Species Act protections from grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park. The population has risen from 136 bears in 1975 to an estimated 700 in 2017, and was \\"delisted\\" in June 2017. =Bear-watching= Bear catches a salmon at Brooks Falls In the past 20 years in Alaska, ecotourism has boomed. While many people come to Alaska to bear-hunt, the majority come to watch the bears and observe their habits. Some of the best bear viewing in the world occurs on coastal areas of the Alaska Peninsula, including in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Katmai National Park and Preserve, and the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary and Refuge. Here bears gather in large numbers to feast on concentrated food sources, including sedges in the salt marshes, clams in the nearby tidal flats, salmon in the estuary streams, and berries on the neighboring hillsides. Katmai National Park and Preserve is one of the best spots to view brown bears. The bear population in Katmai is estimated at a healthy 2,100. The park is located on the Alaskan Peninsula about southwest of the city of Anchorage. At Brooks Camp, a famous site exists where grizzlies can be seen catching salmon from atop a platform‚Äîit can be even viewed online from a cam. In coastal areas of the park, such as Hallo Bay, Geographic Harbor, Swikshak Lagoon, American Creek, Big River, Kamishak River, Savonoski River, Moraine Creek, Funnel Creek, Battle Creek, Nantuk Creek, Kukak Bay, and Kaflia Bay bears can be seen fishing alongside wolves, eagles, and river otters. Coastal areas host the highest population densities year round because there is a larger variety of food sources available, but Brooks Camp hosts the highest population (100 bears). The McNeil River State Game Sanctuary and Refuge, on the McNeil River, is home to the greatest concentration of brown bears in the world. An estimated 144 individual bears have been identified at the falls in a single summer with as many as 74 at one time; 60 or more bears at the falls is a frequent sight, and it is not uncommon to see 100 bears at the falls throughout a single day. The McNeil River State Game Refuge, containing Chenik Lake and a smaller number of grizzly bears, has been closed to grizzly hunting since 1995. All of the Katmai-McNeil area is closed to hunting except for Katmai National Preserve, where regulated legal hunting takes place. In all, the Katmai-McNeil area has an estimated 2,500 grizzly bears. Admiralty Island, in southeast Alaska, was known to early natives as Xootsnoow√∫, meaning \\"fortress of bears,\\" and is home to the densest grizzly population in North America. An estimated 1600 grizzlies live on the island, which itself is only long. One place to view grizzly bears in the island is probably Pack Creek, in the Stan Price State Wildlife Sanctuary. 20 to 30 grizzlies can be observed at the creek at one time and like Brooks Camp, visitors can watch bears from an above platform. Kodiak Island, hence its name, is another place to view bears. An estimated 3,500 Kodiak grizzly bears inhabit the island, 2,300 of these in the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. The O'Malley River is considered the best place on Kodiak Island to view grizzly bears.

Moncrief earned his doctorate in 1972 at the University of Maryland College Park under the supervision of Charles William Misner and worked subsequently at the University of California Berkeley and at the University of Utah. He grew up in Oklahoma City. A key result (obtained jointly with Arthur Fischer of the University of California at Santa Cruz) was to relate the reduced Hamiltonian for Einstein's equations to a topological invariant known as the Yamabe invariant (or sigma constant) for the spatial manifold and to show that the reduced Hamiltonian is monotonically decreasing along all solutions of the field equations (in the direction of cosmological expansion) and therefore evidently seeking to attain its infimum which in turn is expressible in terms of the sigma constant. A discussion of this and related work (with Lars Andersson of the University of Miami and Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat of the Universit√© Paris VI) may be found in Moncrief's and Choquet-Bruhat's lectures at the Cargese summer school on 50 years of the Cauchy Problem in General Relativity. Moncrief's own research is mainly concerned with the global existence and asymptotic properties of cosmological solutions of Einstein's equations and especially the question of how these properties depend upon the topology of spacetime. He is also interested in how a study of the \\"Einstein flow\\" on various manifolds might shed light on open questions in 3-manifold topology itself. Most of this research involves the treatment of sufficiently small but nevertheless fully non-linear perturbations of certain special backgrounds and includes an analysis of higher as well as lower-dimensional spacetimes in addition to physical (3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime.

Feminist activism During the early 1970s, Tanaka was a leading activist for feminism in her native Japan, where the women's liberation movement was called uuman ribu. She helped establish a group of activists known as the Garuppu Tatakau Onnatachi (Fighting Women Group), who staged many public protests that gained a great deal of media attention in Japan. The most extensive and thorough analysis of Tanaka and her role in the liberation movement, elaborated in Scream from the Shadows, by Setsu Shigematsu argues that Group of Fighting Women were akin to (but in some ways differed from) radical feminist groups in the US.Setsu Shigematsu, Scream from the Shadows: The Women's Liberation Movement in Japan (Minnesota: University of Minnesota Press, 2012) http://www.upress.umn.edu/book- division/books/scream-from-the-shadows. They forwarded a comprehensive critique of the political, economic, social and cultural systems of modern Japan due to their patriarchal and capitalist nature. A core element of their critique of Japan's male dominated society focused on the need for the liberation of sex (sei no kaih≈ç), with an emphasis on the need for women's liberation (onna no kaih≈ç) from the Japanese male-centered family system. The group engaged in a variety of feminist campaigns and direct actions. One of the group's largest campaigns was to protect women's access to abortion procedures in Japan. Tanaka's views on abortion became well publicized and controversial: Other Japanese feminists protested in favour of legalization of the birth control pill during the same era. However, the birth control pill was not legalized in Japan until 1999, and women still frequently rely upon abortion as the alternative in Japan today.http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ats/Feb25/feb25_02.html Tanaka led a women's liberation rally (ribu taikai) in 1971, and another in 1972. These protests drew hundreds of women supporters. She worked together with many of feminist activists (such as Tomoko Yonezu, Sachi Sayama, Setsuko Mori) to establish the first women's centre and women's shelter in Japan, the Ribu SentƒÅ, in Shinjuku, Tokyo, in 1972 (it closed in 1977). Yet despite Tanaka's efforts, and the publicity her protests received in Japanese media, the male-dominated media did not take her seriously. As was the case in the United States, some media helped disseminate the message of the movement, but the majority of the male-dominated media mocked the movements transgressive actions. Some may argue that Japan's feminist movement lacked the prominent leaders that the feminist movement in the United States had in the media (such as Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Susan Sontag, and so on), but the most significant difference of the women's liberation movement in Japan, compared with that of liberal feminism (in the U.S. and Japan), is that it did not seek equality with men as their goal. They regarded men as also oppressed by the system, and argued that they also need to be liberated. Feminist activism in Japan remains on the margins of society today, but was more strongly marginalized during the years of Tanaka's activism. Writing Tanaka's first well-known publication was a pamphlet distributed at a rally in 1970, titled Liberation from Eros (Erosu Kaih≈ç Sengen). In this pamphlet, Tanaka called for a break from the Japanese feminist tradition of working for equal economic rights from within conventional social systems: Tanaka's Fighting Women Group published a newsletter in addition to organizing protests. Tanaka was a prolific writer during the early 1970s, producing many pamphlets and essays for the movement. In 1970, she wrote a pamphlet that addressed women's need to change the way they regarded their role in sexual relationships and procreation. It was called Why 'Sex Liberation' - Raising the Problem of Women's Liberation. Tanaka then published a feminist manifesto called Benjo Kara no Kaiho (Liberation from the Toilet) in 1970 that is arguably the most famous manifesto of the movement. This accused leftist men in social justice movements of regarding women as little more than repositories of men's bodily fluids. Tanaka published her best-selling autobiography, Inochi no Onna- tachie: Torimidashi uman ribu ron (For My Spiritual Sisters: A Disorderly Theory of Women's Liberation) in 1972, an account of her personal experiences with misogynist exploitation, including rape and discrimination in employment. This book also includes her critique of the Japanese New Left for its masculinist politics and she reflects on the violence of the United Red Army internal purge.Setsu Shigematsu, \\"The Women's Liberation Movement and the United Red Army: A Radical Feminist Response to Political Violence\\" in Feminist Media Studies Volume 2: Issue 12 (2012). http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14680777.2011.597098#.UYPEmcrHYs0 Departure from public activism Tanaka left public activism after 1975. Today she works as an acupuncturist, considering her \\"liberation activism\\" to be personal in nature now, rather than public. She has stated that she prefers to \\"stand by\\" people rather than leading. She has also expressed the view that earlier feminism attracted followers because it enabled them to express themselves, but because feminists of her generation were not taken seriously by men, they turned to dealing with men on men's terms, adopting a masculine \\"academic\\" approach and using \\"jargon\\", which drove many women away from the movement.

The Army was significantly based on the Polish Legions; it numbered about 30,000 and was expanded during wartime to almost 100,000. It was composed of infantry with a strong cavalry force supported by artillery. The Napoleonic customs and traditions resulted in some social tensions, but are generally credited with helpful modernization and useful reforms. Size The cadre of the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw was formed by the legionnaires of the Polish Legions. In addition, it was filled by older soldiers from the Army of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, who responded to the call to arms of J√≥zef Poniatowski, and patriotic youth. In 1808, after the first emergency period was over, and the Duchy felt more secure, those who wished to leave the army were given leave. The army was expanded with large waves of new recruits on the eve of new wars in 1809 and 1812, when the Duchy fought other partitioners, which resulted in an influx of recruits from those territories, hoping to see their home liberated. The final recruitment phase was that in the fall and winter of 1813, when the Duchy was trying to rally to its own defense in the aftermath of Napoleon's defeat in Russia. Polish Light Horse of the Imperial Guard at Battle of Somosierra, 1808, by January Suchodolski Upon its creation, the Army numbered 30,000 (out of the Duchy's population of 2.6m). The size of the army was a considerable economic burden to the small state. The army was expanded several times; it was doubled in 1809. Several regiments were sponsored by the French. For the war of 1812, almost 100,000 men were fielded ‚Äì more than the Army of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth ever numbered. In the fall of 1813, the Army, reconstructed after the defeat in Russia, numbered about 20,000 or 40,000 (sources vary). It is estimated that about 180,000 to 200,000 men served in the Army throughout its brief existence. Seal of the Minister of War of the Duchy of WarsawIn addition to the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw, Poles also served in other formations allied to France; most notably, the Vistula Legion. In addition to the standing army, a national guard could be called into action, as happened in 1809 and 1811. Notable Polish commanders of the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw included Prince J√≥zef Poniatowski (who was the army chief commander throughout most of its history) and Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski. Composition Vistula Legion The Army of the Duchy of Warsaw was composed of the following formations: * one regiment of cuirassiers (14th) * ten regiments of uhlan lancers (2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 11th, 12th, 15th, 16th); five more were formed in Lithuania in 1812 * two regiments of hussars (10th and 13th) * three regiments of chasseurs (1st, 4th and 5th) * seventeen regiments of infantry (numbered one through seventeen; five more were formed in Lithuania in 1812) * one regiment of horse artillery (composed of four companies) * twenty five companies of regular artillery In 1813 several units of light cavalry, the Krakusi (Cracus, or Polish cossacks), were planned; in the end, one regiment was formed. Culture, training and time of service left The Army was the site of a cultural clash of new, democratic French traditions and old Polish customs, with clashes on the role of nobility in the military ‚Äì with some conservatives attempting to restrict the officer rank to the nobles. The French revolutionary and civic traditions, passed through veteran legionnaires, resulted in more motivation of the peasant recruits, compared to the army of the old Commonwealth. The educational role of the army is seen as one of its major if unintended successes. The army was also improved due to the modernization and adoption of modern French military rules and tactics. Overall, the era of the Duchy of Warsaw marked a period of modernization of the Polish Army, with a new military doctrine and science that was codified by Polish military scholar of that era, Ignacy PrƒÖdzy≈Ñski. The obligatory time of service was set at 6 years, with any citizens aged 21 to 28 having a chance to be randomly chosen for conscription. The Army was supported by the new schools, with the 3-year Elementary School and a 1-year Applicant School for Artillery and Engineering. Overall, the Polish units were reckoned by the French to be highly motivated and of high quality. Operational history Polish uhlans of the Duchy of Warsaw The army was formed at the time of the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807. The army participated in numerous wars on the side of Napoleonic France, including in the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806‚Äì1807), Peninsular War, the War of the Fifth Coalition (primarily in the Polish‚ÄìAustrian War) of 1809, and in the War of the Sixth Coalition (in particular, in the French invasion of Russia) of 1812‚Äì1813. In the Russian campaign of 1812, the Polish units formed an entire corps (the V Corps) of the Grande Arm√©e. The army sustained over 70% losses. The Army suffered further heavy casualties in the battle of Leipzig in 1813, where Prince Poniatowski died. Modern-day reenactment (4th Infantry Regiment of the Duchy of Warsaw)After Napoleonic defeats in 1813, the Duchy was occupied by Napoleon's enemies. As several garrisons in fortresses held out, much of the Army followed Napoleon back to France that year.

Building 3 was one of a pair of identical hangars built to house Pan American's flying boats at the south end of the island. Building 1 was to be the airline's terminal building, and Buildings 2 and 3 would house the aircraft. For the exposition, these buildings were converted to exhibition halls, surrounded by a complex of temporary structures. At the end of the exposition all structures but Buildings 1, 2 and 3 were to be torn down to make way for the development of the reclaimed land as an airport for San Francisco. Original structure Buildings 1, 2 and 3 were designed by San Francisco architects George W. Kelham and William Peyton Day. They were designed in the Art Moderne style considered appropriate for an aviation terminal. Initial construction of the buildings as airplane hangars was complete by July 1938. Building 3 was a reinforced concrete structure about long and wide, and tall on a concrete pile foundation. The roof is a three-hinge riveted steel arch. A one-story section, intended to be retained for the hangar, is wide the length of the southeast side. Exhibition hall For use as the Palace of Fine and Decorative Arts a one-story addition wraps around the other three sides of Building 3. The addition is constructed of reinforced concrete sprayed with stucco. Four concrete towers each almost tall are on the corners. A formal entrance faces northwest in a concave indentation with scallops or broad flutes in the surface of the marquee over the door. From the other elevations the structure's heritage as a hangar is visible, with the taller hangar section looming over the additions. The interior was fitted out for the exposition with curving temporary plaster walls to house a $20 million collection of artwork, designed by Dorothy Wright Liebes and Shepard Vogelsang. The space was extensively subdivided into small galleries. The 1939 season of the exposition was a failure, with half the visitation expected at only 10 million patrons. The exposition closed two months early, four million dollars in debt. It reopened in 1940. For the 1940 season Diego Rivera painted the Pan Am Unity fresco. The fair closed on September 29, 1940, still in debt. Navy use Front elevation of the Palace of Fine and Decorative Arts (Building 3) Following the fair's closure the U.S. Navy, which already had a station on adjacent Yerba Buena Island, took over Treasure Island as the Naval Training and Distribution Center, Treasure Island. The station trained security forces for merchant ships after the United States' entry into World War II. The Palace of Fine and Decorative Arts became an equipment repair center. The Hall of Transportation (Building 2) reverted to use as a hangar. The Administration Building (Building 1) continued to serve as an administration center. At the end of the war the station became a major separation facility for returning servicemen being mustered out of the armed services. The station was finally closed in 1997. Building 3 has since been used as a film production location. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 26, 2008.

A distinctive type of Ottoman tower houses (singular: ; , kuli; , all meaning \\"towers\\", from Arabic ŸÇŸéŸÑŸíÿπŸéÿ©‚Äé (qal øa, ‚Äúfort, fortress‚Äù) via Persian qulla,Fishta-Elsie-Mathie-Heck 2006, p. 435 meaning \\"mountain\\" or \\"top\\" and Turkish kule) developed and were built in the BalkansGreville Pounds 1994, p. 335: \\"In southeastern Europe, where the extended family was exemplified as nowhere else in the western world, the home itself was often protected, giving rise to the kula or tower- house.\\" (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Kosovo, Macedonia and Serbia), as well as in Romania, after the Ottoman conquest in the Middle Ages by both Christian and Muslim communities. The practice began during the decline of Ottoman power in the 17th centuryGrube-Mitchell 1978, p. 204: \\"a distinctive form of defensive tower-dwelling, the kula, developed among both the Christian and the Muslim communities during the insecure period of the decline of the Ottoman authority in the 17th century ...\\" and flourished until the early 20th century. The tower houses were typically made out of stone, rose three or four storeys, and were square or rectangular in shape. They served both military (defence, watchtower) and civilian (residential) purposes in order to protect the extended family. In Albania Tower house in Tropoje, northern Albania Types of towerhouses in Albanian architecture existed before the Ottoman invasion of the Balkans, especially in Gjirokast√´r. Albanian kull√´ are predominantly found in the north of the country, with notable instances in the south being Berat, Gjirokast√´r,Stubbs- Maka≈° 2011, p. 392 Himara, and K√´lcyr√´.Epirus, 4000 years of Greek history and civilization. p. 334 Kullas are heavily fortified buildings with small windows and shooting holes, because their main purpose was to offer security in a fighting situation. The first kullas that were built are from the 17th century, a time when there was continuous fighting in the Dukagjini region, although most of the ones that still remain are from the 18th or 19th century. They are almost always built within a complex of buildings with various functions, but kullas in towns exist mostly as standalone structures. They are also positioned within the complex of buildings that they exist in a way that makes it possible for the inhabitants to survey the surrounding area. Kullas in towns are usually built as standalone structures, while in villages they are more commonly found as a part of a larger ensemble of kullas and stone houses, usually grouped based on the family clan they belonged to. Certain kull√´ were used as places of isolation and safe havens, or \\"locked towers\\" (), intended for the use of persons targeted by blood feuds (gjakmarrja). An example can be found in Theth, northern Albania. There are also instances of fortified tower-houses in Gjirokast√´r built in the 13th century, pre-dating Ottoman conquest.Internationale Tourismusattraktionen in Mittel- und S√ºdosteuropa. √ñsterreichisches Ost- und S√ºdosteuropa-Institut, 1999, p. 2. In Bulgaria Kurtpashov Tower in Vratsa, Bulgaria Examples of fortified residential towers in Bulgarian lands include the 16th-century Tower of the Meshchii (converted into a clock tower in the 19th century) and the 17th- century Kurtpashov Tower in Vratsa in Bulgaria's northwest. The Pirgova (Pirkova) Tower, similar in purpose but different in design, was built in the southwestern town of Kyustendil in the 14th or 15th century. The tower in Teshovo in south Pirin, noted for its relatively sophisticated water conduit and sewage system, is also thought to date to the early Ottoman rule of Bulgaria and may well have been the residence of a local bey. Hrelyo's Tower, built in 1334‚Äì5 by pr≈çtosebastos Hrelja in the courtyard of the Rila Monastery, is a pre-Ottoman example of an autonomous tower that served residential as well as defensive purposes. Besides featuring habitable floors, the Hrelyo's Tower also includes an Orthodox chapel on its top floor. In Greece Tower houses in Vatheia, Mani peninsula The tradition of towerhouses in Greek architecture existed since Byzantine and Frankish times. Although the Ottoman-period architecture has almost completely disappeared from Greek urban centres, there are scattered examples of tower houses built in Ottoman Greece and during the chifliks.Sigalos 2004, p. 53 Alongside the fortified houses of Mani (called xemonia), there are also residential towers (koule) of Ottoman origin. Greek architects have claimed that the Albanian tower houses developed under Greek influence.Sigalos 2004, p. 48: \\"The Albanian kula, or tower house, for example, was regarded to have developed under Greek influence (Megas 1951, 1967).\\" In Kosovo Kulla in Kosovo In Kosovo the traditional two- or three- storey kullas were built mainly between the 18th century and the early part of the 20th century.Rassam 2001, p. 2 They are constructed entirely of locally excavated stone, though some incorporate decorative wooden elements in the upper floors. Historically the kullas have been inhabited solely by men, with women and children housed in a connected annexe. The exterior walls are a meter thick at ground level but become thinner towards the roof. The small openings that play the role of windows are called fr√´ngji,Rassam 2001, p. 3 and their tiny size is due to the kulla's historical use as a fortification and as a means of protection against attacks. Aspects of kulla life are strongly influenced by Muslim culture, especially the segregation between men and women in social spaces and entrances.Rassam 2001, p. 6 The kullas' characteristic double sets of entrances and staircases (main and side) reflect this division, since only the side entrance and staircase lead to the private family quarters. Kullas are also well-suited to the Kosovan climate as their construction allows them to remain cool in the summer and warm during winter. Examples include Jashar Pasha's Tower, Haxhi Zeka's Tower, Xhafer Syla's Tower, Mazrekaj Tower, Janjevo Tower, Tomiƒá's Tower. Nenadoviƒá's Tower, in Valjevo, Serbia In Serbia Nenadoviƒá's Tower () was built by Jakov Nenadoviƒá in springtime 1813 in Valjevo, ≈†umadija.

It was released September 1, 2011 for iOS devices, and serves as the sequel to DrawRace. It is played by drawing an ideal racing line on the game's screen with a finger. The car then follows this line during a race. The game was well received by critics, and holds a four stars rating and an average score of 88/100 at review aggregator Metacritic. Gameplay In DrawRace 2 the player creates a driving path for their vehicle (shown in red) with their finger prior to each race. Their car then follows that path during the race. DrawRace 2 is a racing game in which the player predetermines their vehicle's route around a given track by drawing an ideal racing line. The entire course is seen from a top down perspective, similar to the 1986 arcade game Super Sprint. The game includes 30 tracks, 16 cars and 180 challenges for players to complete. Leaderboards and leagues are also included. Multiplayer can be played with 2-4 players. It differs from most top-down racers in that players use their finger to draw the route their car will take for all given laps. Players can draw faster or slower to have the car accelerate and brake once the race begins. Once all laps are drawn by the player the race begins, and the player's vehicle will follow the drawn path, taking into account the speed at which the player drew the route. During the actual race players can control a turbo boost button to give their car an increase in speed. This boost recharges over time. Development and marketing DrawRace 2 was released September 1, 2011 for iOS devices. On November 8, 2011 a free version entitled DrawRace 2 Free Multiplayer was released. The version includes 2-4 player gameplay, three tracks and three cars. Reception DrawRace 2 received mostly positive reviews from critics. The game holds a score of 88/100 at Metacritic. The site also reports five media outlets gave the game perfect scores: AppSpy, Slide to Play, AppSmile, TouchGen, and Vandal Online. The lowest score came from PocketGamer France's reviewer, who gave the game a 68% approval rating. The game was the top seller the week of its release in several European countries, and placed in the top ten in more than 45 countries. VideoGamer.com listed it in their Top Racing Games of 2011, and Game Informer listed it in their \\"20 Mobile Games You Should Be Playing\\" feature. GameZone Andrew Hayward said \\"DrawRace 2 melds racing and strategy in a unique and iPad-centric sort of way\\". He further stated that while the control scheme probably would not \\"evolve the racing genre\\", it worked well for touchscreen devices. In Metro's review of the game critic Roger Hargreaves called it \\"the most addictive and enjoyably infuriating turn-based game of the year.\\" Hargreaves cited the large amount of content, multiplayer features, and presentation as high points of the game. Toby Moses of The Guardian also praised the game. He stated that it was an improvement over the original DrawRace, and felt that it \\"could well be the must-have app of the year.\\" Slide to Play's Andrew Webster felt the game was a major improvement over its predecessor. He called it \\"a more fleshed out and expansive experience\\". Eurogamer's Kristan Reed thoroughly enjoyed the game -- so much so that it prompted a change the site's mobile review format. Previously all reviewed games were covered under a blanket feature known as Mobile Games Roundup. Reed stated that in the new format highly rated games would not be limited to a small review, but in the future \\"games as brilliant as DrawRace 2 [will now] on will get the extra depth they deserve.\\" He further noted that the price-to- value ratio was extremely high, and even jokingly stated that players should send RedLynx additional money past the purchase to make up for the value.

However, four days later, someone claiming to be a spokesman for the group denied that the organization was responsible for the attack, saying the video that was previously provided is a fake, and that any information regarding their operations would be announced through jihadi forums. On 18 May, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon stated that he believed al-Qaeda was behind the attack by saying: \\"Very alarmingly and surprisingly, a few days ago, there was a huge serious massive terrorist attack. I believe that there must be Al-Qaeda behind it. This has created again very serious problems\\".\\"Ban Ki-moon says Al-Qaeda behind Damascus bombings\\" BBC News.

One of them is quoted as saying \\"Three days before the bomb the Alawite officers started disappearing and so too did all of the important prisoners ...

The documents allegedly indicate the purpose of the attack was to discredit the opposition and convince the international community that terrorists were active in the country. According to the Al Arabiya, Maj. Gen. Dhu al-Himma Shalish, head of presidential security, ordered Colonel Suhail Hassan of the Air Force Intelligence Directorate to carry out the bombing citing direct orders from the president.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rapid City and serves Oglala Lakota Native American children on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Background The school was founded in 1888 as Holy Rosary Mission. The Jesuits and Sisters of St. Francis of Penance and Christian Charity founded the institution at the request of Chief Red Cloud. Once the school had been approved, the construction of the main mission building began. All of the bricks for the building were made from local clay and lime on the grounds of what is today Red Cloud Indian School's Pine Ridge campus. It was the only two-story building in the area. The four-school, K-12 school system was renamed Red Cloud in 1969. The student population quickly grew to more than 100 students. Students were divided into three classes: one for all younger students and separate classes for older girls and older boys. The older students spent half their day learning reading, writing, and arithmetic and the other half performing domestic duties to keep the mission running. The young women often worked in the kitchen and laundry rooms, while the young men spent their time in the wood and metal shops, or farming the land. Red Cloud High School opened in 1937. Five students graduated from the school in 1942, with Oryal Cuny as the salutatorian and Lyle Clifford as the valedictorian. Classes became integrated and the boarding parts of the school were closed. The farms associated with the school were converted to various uses like football fields, field houses, and parking lots. As enrollment grew, a second kindergarten through eighth grade campus, Our Lady of Lourdes, was opened in Porcupine, about 30 minutes from the Pine Ridge campus. In 1969, Holy Rosary Mission was officially renamed Red Cloud Indian School, both as a token of respect for the man whose work had made the school possible and as part of a program of re-identification to emphasize its native-American roots over cultural imperialism, and the lasting bond between groups from two separate cultures who wanted to enhance the best parts of both worlds to serve the people of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Present day \\\\- Red Cloud High School boasts 72 Bill and Melinda Gates Millennium Scholarship recipients, the highest per capita in the country. \\\\- Seniors have been awarded full tuition with room and board at Dartmouth College, Stanford University, Duke University, Marquette University, and Creighton University, among many others. \\\\- All graduates have plans to further their education and training, attending more than 25 colleges today, like Princeton, Arizona State, New Mexico, and Black Hills State. \\\\- Students intern at nationally recognized organizations including the Institute of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health. \\\\- All of high school students volunteer on the reservation. Some travel as far as Washington DC to give back to other communities. \\\\- The Heritage Center is home to 10,000 pieces of the Native American contemporary and historical Lakota art, which has all been digitally cataloged. \\\\- The Red Cloud Indian Art Show welcomes nearly 200 artists, both seasoned professionals and emerging young artists, to showcase their work each year. \\\\- Outreach programs confront addictions like alcohol and drugs head-on, and offer health and wellness initiatives to families who may not have access to these programs otherwise. \\\\- More than 800 families are served through pastoral ministry programs in the various church communities.

Negotiations began between Pratt, Gevinson, and Say Media, the internet publisher behind Pratt's women's lifestyle site xoJane. This American Life host Ira Glass acted as a consultant to Gevinson and her manager and father, Steve, during the negotiations.

The project consists of multi-instrumentalists and producers Melati Malay and Isaac Emmanuel. The group is known for their percussive musical style, often incorporating field recordings made by band members. The duo have released mixtapes in collaboration with London-based visual artist Leif Podhajsky, who is also responsible for the band's album cover artwork. They have collaborated with American composer Kelsey Lu, UK trip hop pioneer Tricky, and have been sampled by Purity Ring and Playboi Carti. History =Formation= Original members Melati Malay, Isaac Emmanuel and Michael Italia met in New York City during 2010. Malay was born in Jakarta, Indonesia, Emmanuel and Italia in Australia. After separately traveling abroad and recording material, the group rented a space above a speakeasy in Brooklyn during 2011 and began collaborating. Their debut 7\\" single, \\"Sparkly/You With Air\\", was released on February 8, 2011 by Carpark Records, followed by \\"Night in the Ocean/Slip Time\\". =Melt= Young Magic's debut studio album, Melt, was released by Carpark on February 14, 2012. The LP was recorded in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, United States, Spain, Germany, Iceland, Australia and the UK. The New York Times described the music on Melt as \\"Lush and immersive, on Young Magic's debut the reverb ripples, synthesizers swoop, quasi-tribal percussion crunches and plinks and voices ooh and ah in washes of harmony.\\" The BBC described the debut as \\"music that waxes and wanes, and explodes; and a great spirit which, rather than confine itself to basements and bedsits, aims its sights on the heavens\\". The band released the limited-edition Maps mixtape later that year, consisting of recorded material which did not fit on Melt. In 2012 Purity Ring sampled the lead vocal from Young Magic's You With Air on their song \\"Grandloves\\" from the album Shrines (4AD).

The album was inspired by Malay's travels in her birthplace of Java, Indonesia. In Interview magazine, the singer explained, \\"Still Life can be one version of yourself, still like a painting, but on the other hand constantly recreating that version of yourself according to environmental, social, political influences in this world...a world where people constantly tell you who to pray to, what to buy into, and who your enemies should be.

Biography Born near Mehoopany, Wyoming County, Pennsylvania, Harris was the son of Emer Harris and Deborah Lott. He was a nephew of Martin Harris, one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon, and a descendant of Thomas Harris, companion in exile of Roger Williams, and one of the founders of Providence, Rhode Island. Harris was baptized a member of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in September 1842, by Milton Stow, near Nauvoo, Illinois. Harris served as a guard in Nauvoo to protect Joseph Smith against mob violence. He also served in the Nauvoo Legion and witnessed the laying of the cornerstone of the Nauvoo Temple. After being driven with other Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo in 1846, he resided temporarily in St. Louis, Missouri until 1850, when he went to Kanesville, Iowa and then to Utah.Martin Henderson Harris, A Utah Pioneer: His Life, Labors, and Posterity (Martin Henderson Harris Family Organization) 1952 In 1851 Harris commenced farming at what is now Harrisville, where he built a house and fenced some land, his being the first house west of Four Mile Creek, and the only house which remained standing in that neighborhood during the \\"Move South,\\" in consequence of which the ward, when organized some years afterwards, was named after him. Harris served as president of the first Latter-day Saint co-operative store in Ogden. He also served as road commissioner of Weber County for 11 years and assisted in locating most of the highways of that county. Harris was ordained a Seventy September 5, 1853 by Luman A. Shurtliff, and was secretary for many years of the 38th Quorum of Seventies. Harris was the first missionary called from the district to the Salmon River Mission, and during \\"The Move\\" in 1858 he went South. He was also fifer in the first military band of Weber County. In the summer of 1863, Harris was appointed presiding Elder of the Eighth ecclesiastical district (later Harrisville). When the so-called Eighth District was organized with a president November 15, 1863, he was set apart as first counselor to Luman A. Shurtliff. He taught the first school in the Harrisville district in his own house without pay, and acted as the first superintendent of the district Sunday school that was organized in May 1865, a position he held until September 13, 1868. He acted as district or Ward clerk for many years and culled data from private records and other sources in compiling the Harrisville Ward history for 25 years, beginning with 1850.Jenson, Andrew. \\"Martin Henderson Harris.\\" LDS Biographical Encyclopedia (1914) Harris became known as an experimental horticulturist and planted many trees from other parts of the United States which were thought at the time to be inhospitable to Utah's climate. Some hardwood trees which Harris planted in 1876 in honor of America's Centennial remain standing. In 1976, the nation's bicentennial year, the city of Harrisville bought property originally owned by Harris for the Martin Henderson Harris Memorial Park. In 1877 Harris was called to serve a one-year mission to the Eastern States. On account of sickness he returned, and never fully recovered. Harris died February 14, 1889 of palsy at Harrisville, and was buried in the Ogden City Cemetery. A monument in Harris's honor was erected by descendants and Harrisville citizens on September 27, 1955, on the 105th anniversary of his arrival in Weber County. Family Harris married Georgiana Maria Aldous January 18, 1855; she died October 30, 1858, leaving a son Emer, born August 6, 1856.

This authorized him to engage in offensive action against the French, not just defensive, should the opportunity arise. Captain Moore sailed Fortune from England on 28 January 1806. She was part of a convoy under the escort of that included the merchant transports (Lady Madeleine) , Elizabeth, Justina, and the fellow convict transport . The vessels passed Madeira on 25 February and were reported all well on 5 March. Fortune arrived at Rio de Janeiro on 11 April and left on 30 April. She arrived at Port Jackson on 27 July. Fortune had embarked some 245 male convicts, three of whom died on the voyage. The 8th Royal Veteran Battalion provided the guard, and one member of the guard also died on the voyage. Fortune left Port Jackson on 19 August bound for China. =2nd convict voyage (1812-13)= Captain Thomas Walker received letter of marque against America ‚Ññ106.

Kennedy was born in Manchester, England, around 1855 (obituaries stated his age as either 39 or 45, the latter putting his birth year around 1849), and was a talented ventriloquist as a child. After working briefly as a teacher and seaman, by 1871 he had made it to Montreal and began performing as a ventriloquist. He debuted in New York City in 1874 and traveled with various minstrel groups. In 1890, he opened \\"Harry Kennedy's Theatre\\" in New York, but sold out and moved after one season to a smaller venue, the Alhambra, on Coney Island. He also managed a bar on Fulton Street in Brooklyn.

It opened on December 15, 2012. It is located at 11 East 26th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues, across from Madison Square Park in the NoMad neighborhood. It is the only museum dedicated to mathematics in North America, and features over thirty interactive exhibits. The mission of the museum is to \\"enhance public understanding and perception of mathematics\\". The museum is known for a special tricycle with square wheels, which operates smoothly on a catenary surface. History In 2006 the Goudreau Museum on Long Island, at the time the only museum in the United States dedicated to mathematics, closed its doors. In response, a group led by founder and former CEO Glen Whitney met to explore the opening of a new museum. They received a charter from the New York State Department of Education in 2009, and raised over 22 million dollars in under four years. With this funding, a space was leased in the Goddard Building at 11-13 East 26th Street, located in the Madison Square North Historic District. Despite some opposition to the architectural plans within the local community, permission for construction was granted by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and the Department of Buildings. Programs * Math Midway is a traveling exhibition of math-based interactive displays. The exhibits include a square-wheeled tricycle that travels smoothly over an undulating cycloidal track; the Ring of Fire, which uses lasers to intersect three-dimensional objects with a two-dimensional plane to uncover interesting shapes; and an \\"organ function grinder\\" which allows users to create their own mathematical functions and see the results. After making its debut at the World Science Festival in 2009, Math Midway traveled the country, reaching more than a half million visitors. The Midway's schedule included stops in New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, California, New Jersey, Ohio, Maryland, Florida, Indiana, and Oregon. In 2016, the Math Midway exhibit was sold to the Science Centre Singapore. * Math Midway 2 Go (MM2GO) is a spinoff of Math Midway. MM2GO includes six of the most popular Math Midway Exhibits. MM2GO began traveling to science festivals, schools, community centers, and libraries in the autumn of 2012. * Math Encounters is a monthly speaker series presented by the Museum of Math and the Simons Foundation. The lectures initially took place at Baruch College in Manhattan on the first Wednesday of each month, but moved to MoMath's visitor center at 11 East 26th Street in March, 2013. Every month a different mathematician is invited to deliver a lecture. Lecturers have included Google's Director of Research Peter Norvig, journalist Paul Hoffman, and computer scientist Craig Kaplan. Examples of topics are \\"The Geometry of Origami\\", \\"The Patterns of Juggling\\", and \\"Mathematical Morsels from The Simpsons and Futurama\\". The lectures are meant to be accessible and engaging for high school students and adults. The first lecture occurred on March 3, 2011. Twenty unique lectures had been delivered . * Family Fridays began in April 2014 and occur once a month. MoMath and Time Warner Cable launched the initiative to provide free mathematical opportunities to low- income families in the form of an event series with new activities and presentations each month. In 2017, the sponsorship was taken over by Two Sigma. Exhibits Square wheeled tricycles at MoMath In October 2016, the exhibit The Insides of Things: The Art of Miguel Berrocal was opened, displaying a collection of puzzle sculptures by Spanish artist Miguel Ortiz Berrocal (1933-2006), donated by the late Samuel Sensiper. Each sculpture can be disassembled into small interlocking pieces, eventually revealing a small piece of jewelry or other surprise.

It was in existence by the 15th century, and appears as Whit crose on the 1610 map of the town by cartographer John Speed. It runs in an east-west direction, between Church Street and St James Square. It has been suggested that the street takes its name from a plague cross. Whitecross Street is lined with numerous listed buildings. History and location Like several other streets in Monmouth, Whitecross Street is believed to have been laid out and named by the middle of the 15th century. It is located inside the medieval walls of the town, built around 1300. Most of the street's buildings were originally based on narrow burgage plots, with gable ends facing the street. St James House in Whitecross Street, though later rebuilt, is regarded as a particularly good example of the style.Keith Kissack, Monmouth and its Buildings, Logaston Press, 2003, , p.29 On the map of Monmouth (pictured) engraved by John Speed in 1610, Whitecross Street (L on the map) is referred to as Whit crose. As discussed in a 2009 watching brief by the firm of Monmouth Archaeology, it has been assumed that the street was named after a white cross. Historically, such a cross was customarily a plague cross (link to example below). It is speculated that the cross in question might be the one drawn by Speed in the churchyard of St Mary's Priory Church on his 1610 map. However, according to local publisher and antiquary Charles Heath, writing in 1804, the stone cross after which the street was named was located on the site of a later public weighing machine, and its remains \\"were in existence in the memory of the present inhabitants.\\" Charles Heath, Historical and descriptive accounts of the ancient and present state of the town of Monmouth..., 1804 Whitecross Street is the eastward extension of the now- pedestrianised Church Street. As it extends eastward and slightly to the north, the road intersects with Monk Street. Beyond the intersection, Whitecross Street continues to the east, dipping slightly to the south. It terminates at the roundabout encircling the triangular St James Square. The square is remarkable for an Indian Bean Tree (Catalpa), a native of the southeastern United States. St James Square also features the Monmouth War Memorial, designed by W. Clarke of Llandaff and installed in front of the Catalpa in 1921. On some modern-day maps, the eastern leg of Whitecross Street, from the intersection with Monk Street to its termination at the roundabout encircling St James Square, is also referred to as St James Square, such that some buildings in Whitecross Street have two addresses. Buildings The Griffin (pictured below) at 1 Whitecross Street, is an 18th- century building which was grade II listed on 8 October 2005. Also referred to as The Griffin Inn, the public house is located at the corner of Whitecross Street and St Mary's Street, across from the gates of St Mary's Church. Originally The Old Griffin, it was rebuilt in the 1830s. A plaque with an image of a legendary creature, the griffin, is displayed on the facade of the building above the entrance (pictured). In addition, at the base of the pub, there is a rare hollowed sandstone gutter. St Mary's Priory Church (pictured below) on Whitecross Street is a Grade II* listed building. It is one of 24 blue plaque buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail. The main surviving medieval component of the building is the 14th-century tower. The church was rebuilt in the 18th and 19th centuries. 5 Whitecross Street is a mid-19th- century house which is not included on the 1835 map of Monmouth by John Wood. The small, two-storey listed building has a painted exterior and a slate roof. Architectural details suggest that it was formerly a small shop. Merrick House at 6 Whitecross Street is an 18th-century listed building. The three-storey house has five windows across and a slate roof. Whitecross Street, recorded as numbers 3-11, is a listed dwelling, its record with the collection of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales. 13 Whitecross Street is a 19th-century listed building. The two-storey building has two windows across and a stucco on brick exterior. The Priory House (pictured below) at 15 Whitecross Street is an 18th-century grade II listed building. The three-storey building has a red tile roof. It currently serves as a private political club. Whitecross House (link to photograph below) at 17 Whitecross Street is a mid-18th-century, three-storey house with five bays. The bed and breakfast is painted white with black trim and has a view of Monk Street. Whitecross House is a listed building. The Hollies on Whitecross Street is an 18th-century, well-preserved Georgian house which was grade II listed in 1974. Also referred to as the Holly House, the three-storey, red brick building has a slate roof. Architectural details include a moulded cornice and parapet. The interior is remarkable for its staircase. The building was listed for its architectural interest, and is located immediately behind 17 Whitecross Street. The Rolls Hall (pictured below) on Whitecross Street is a 19th-century Grade II listed building. It is one of 24 blue plaque buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail. Now the Public Library, it was built in 1887-8 of Old Red Sandstone and grey Forest of Dean ashlar. The building was a gift to the town of Monmouth by John Allan Rolls, the future Lord Llangattock. 23 and 25 Whitecross Street is a pair of 19th-century listed houses. Together, there are seven bays. It is a two-storey complex, although No 23 is three-storey in part. The Judges' Lodgings at 27 Whitecross Street, just north of St James Square, is a grade II listed building. It is located opposite the public library, also known as Rolls Hall, and is one of 24 blue plaque buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail. The Judges' Lodgings has its origins in two adjacent 16th-century houses, which underwent extensive alterations in the 17th through 19th centuries. It was known previously as the Labour in Vain public house and Somerset House. It is also referred to as St James Garage and Mews. The three-storey, five-window section to the left has a red brick exterior. The two-storey, two window section to the right has a painted exterior. St James House (pictured below) on Whitecross Street (the address also recorded at St James Square) is an 18th-century, three-storey listed building. There are five bays and the front, red brick facade is remarkable for a tall, arched window above the entrance. The building was part of Monmouth School and was used as a boarding house. 33 Whitecross Street (pictured below) at St James Square is a grade II listed building, most probably of the 18th century. While the front elevation is three storeys, the rear has a two-storey elevation. It was listed initially in 1974, and by Cadw in 2008, and was included due to its special architectural interest and its location amid other historic buildings.

The parcel tax in its typical form as a flat tax is regressive: While most parcel taxes are a fixed amount per parcel, some are based on the size of the parcel or its improvements.  Origin  Parcel taxes originated in response to California's Proposition 13 (1978), a state initiative constitutional amendment approved by California voters in June 1978. Proposition 13 limited the property tax rate based on the assessed value of real estate to 1% per year. However, a parcel tax circumvents the property tax rate limits of Proposition 13 because it does not vary according to the assessed value of the property. As a result, a parcel tax does not violate the ad valorem property tax rate limits of Proposition 13.Heckendorn v. City of San Marino (1986) 42 Cal.3d 481.  Operation  = Voter approval = Simple majority vote parcel taxes were found unconstitutional under the uniformity of property taxation provision of the California Constitution.Cal. Const., art. XIII, ¬ß 1; City of Oakland v. Digre (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 99. To the extent parcel taxes are legally authorized and allowed by law, Proposition 218 (1996) (\\"Right to Vote on Taxes Act\\") requires every parcel tax be levied as a special tax (a tax legally dedicated for specific purposes) subject to two- thirds voter approval.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 3, subd. (a), par. (2). The two-thirds voter approval requirement has also been applied to a local parcel tax initiative measure proposed by the electorate exercising the local initiative power.Altadena Library District v. Bloodgood, 192 Cal. App. 3d 585 (June 1987). = Uniformity requirement and other statutory limitations = The legal authority to levy a parcel tax comes from California state statutes which usually include additional restrictions and limitations on the ability of a local government to levy a parcel tax. The requirement that many parcel taxes apply uniformly to all taxpayers or all real property within a local government is a direct result of statutory restrictions imposed by the California Legislature and not as a result of any requirements under the California Constitution, including Proposition 13. There has been significant political opposition to easing the statutory uniformity requirement for parcel taxes, especially from the business community which would incur a significant increased (but generally more equitable) property tax burden if the uniformity requirement were eased by the California Legislature.  Fairness  Due to the statutory uniformity requirement for most local government parcel taxes, major tax fairness issues arise. Flat parcel taxes are very regressive because they require owners of smaller or lower valued property to pay the same total amount as owners of larger or higher valued property, which many homeowners believe to be unfair. To be less regressive, parcel taxes should not be flat but instead be based on parcel size. When the Alameda Unified School District attempted to mitigate this inequity by imposing a parcel tax that would require large commercial properties to pay a larger tax amount than residential homeowners, a California appeals court declared the tax invalid.Borikas v. Alameda Unified School Dist., 214 Cal. App. 4th 135, 154 Cal. Rptr. 3d 186 (Ct. App. 2013). In response, the California State Senate passed a bill by Governance and Finance Chair Lois Wolk to authorize school districts to levy a higher parcel tax on commercial property,SB-1021 http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/sen/sb_1001-1050/sb_1021_cfa_20140403_133301_sen_comm.htmlCalifornia State Senate Floor Session Item: SB-1021 School districts: parcel taxes. Wolk (May 5, 2014) http://calchannel.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=&clip;_id=2094&meta;_id=20175 but the bill then subsequently failed to pass in an Assembly committee. = Proportion of single-family residential parcels = Since in most California communities the vast majority of taxable parcels are single-family residential, the statutory uniformity requirement results in most of the tax burden for a parcel tax falling on single-family residential property owners. For example, in Los Angeles County about 79% of the taxable parcels are single-family residential parcels (including condominiums).Los Angeles County Assessor, 2015 Assessor‚Äôs Annual Report, p. 7. As another example, in Santa Clara County about 88% of the taxable parcels are single-family residential parcels (including condominiums).Santa Clara County Assessor, 2015-16 Assessor‚Äôs Annual Report, p. 12. It is for this reason local business communities are often supportive of parcel taxes because the tax burden on commercial parcels, especially large commercial parcels, is very low. Business interest groups in California such as the Bay Area Council, the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, and the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce frequently support parcel taxes that disproportionately burden single-family residential parcels. = Burden on property owners over other potential revenue sources = Significant fairness issues associated with parcel taxes also arise concerning the appropriateness of singling out property owners to bear the additional tax burden for financing some public services and programs, especially those services and programs that provide general benefits to the community at large (other than property owners) or benefits to nonresidents of a community who may pay little or no taxes to the local government. However, a study shows that the percentage of renters in a school district has no impact on the likelihood of getting a parcel tax measure approved in school districts. = Burden versus benefits = Parcel taxes also don‚Äôt legally require any relationship between the tax amount paid (or the ability to pay) and the benefits received. As a result, it is up to local voters in a parcel tax election to carefully weigh and evaluate the merits of any parcel tax proposal. In some instances, other types of taxes may be more equitable. In other instances, other financing mechanisms may be more appropriate to finance all or part of the public services or improvements under consideration. For example, special assessments on real property are appropriately used to finance public services and improvements that specially benefit property above and beyond benefits received by the community at large. This is particularly appropriate where a small number of parcels, such as large commercial (business) parcels, receive special benefits not shared by the rest of the community.  Cumulative tax burden  Local voters must also consider the cumulative tax burden associated with a specific parcel tax proposal. Some parcel tax proposals may be relatively modest in amount but when added to the other parcel levies that already appear on the property tax bill would add to a cumulative tax burden that may already be unacceptable to many property taxpayers (especially homeowners). Furthermore, passage of a parcel tax establishes political precedent that can lead to additional and often more expensive parcel tax measures in the future by the same or other local governments in the area.  Effects on K-12 school funding  Research has shown that California school districts able to pass parcel tax measures tend to be more prosperous and to have lower percentages of minority students than those where parcel tax measures failed, or were never proposed. For example, in Oakland, California, where 68.5% of the students qualify for free lunch programs, property owners pay a $195 annual parcel tax while in its enclave Piedmont, where 0.3% of students qualify for free lunch programs, owners pay at minimum a $1,200 annual parcel tax. Over 80% of school districts with voter-approved parcel taxes are in the relatively wealthy San Francisco Bay Area. In addition, in the case of school parcel taxes, a study shows that school districts where home values are more or less similar have a greater likelihood of raising parcel tax revenues, compared to school districts where home values are greatly different. The preceding also raises significant school funding equity issues under the California Supreme Court Serrano decisions.Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584; Serrano v. Priest (1976) 18 Cal.3d 728. The Serrano cases did not specifically address the legality of K-12 public education parcel taxes because such taxes did not exist at that time.  Reduction-or-repeal process  Proposition 218 (1996) (\\"Right to Vote on Taxes Act\\") constitutionally reserves to local voters the right to use the initiative power to reduce or repeal any local tax, assessment, fee or charge, including provision for a significantly reduced petition signature requirement to qualify a measure on the ballot.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 3. A local initiative under Proposition 218 can target for reduction or repeal local government parcel taxes, especially in situations where major tax fairness issues are present in a particular community. A local initiative under Proposition 218 could also be pursued as a tie-in initiative that would tie the continued imposition of a parcel tax to satisfaction of specified conditions. For example, a local initiative could attach an annual matching contribution condition whereby a parcel tax would be reduced or repealed if the specified annual matching contribution condition is not satisfied. A matching contribution condition is intended to leverage additional financial support as well as to demonstrate a strong financial commitment to the purposes for which the parcel tax is imposed, especially from those interests who promoted the parcel tax. Matching contributions typically come from the private sector in the form of voluntary payments such as from the local business community. This approach is particularly appropriate in places like Los Angeles County and the Silicon Valley where the local business community tends to be big supporters of tax increases that disproportionately burden ordinary taxpayers, such as parcel taxes, but generally opposes tax increases on the business community for the same public purposes.

At first, troops under Arthur Wellesley, Marquess Wellington surrounded the city, but they were soon replaced by Spanish units. In late July 1813, Marshal Nicolas Soult attempted to relieve the city but his operation failed in the Battle of the Pyrenees. Cassan capitulated to the Spanish after the French troops in the city were reduced to starvation. The surrender negotiations were marred by French bluffs to blow up the fortifications and Spanish threats to massacre the garrison, neither of which occurred. Pamplona is located on the Arga River in the province of Navarre in northern Spain. The siege occurred during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Background Marquess Wellington drove the French from northern Spain by his decisive victory at the Battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813. During the afternoon of 24 June, the defeated army of Joseph Bonaparte and Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan streamed past Pamplona. The soldiers were not allowed to enter the fortress for fear that they would plunder the garrison's food supplies. The following day, Victor Alten's British cavalry brigade appeared before Pamplona, followed by the infantry of the Anglo-Portuguese Light Division. One authority stated that the blockade around Pamplona was set up on 25 June. A second source asserted that 26 June was the date that Pamplona was invested. On 26 June, Wellington intended to close off Pamplona on the south side with the Light and 4th Divisions and on the north side by the 3rd and 7th Divisions. However, the British army commander found that he had a chance to cut off Bertrand Clausel's divisions, so he sent the Light and 4th Divisions marching after the French. The 3rd and 7th Divisions were ordered to follow the other two divisions when Rowland Hill's corps arrived to relieve them. There was a brief opportunity for Wellington to launch an all-out pursuit of Joseph and Jourdan's broken army by invading southern France. There were several reasons why Wellington did not try this, though some of his officers expected it. The paramount reason was that the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia had signed the Truce of Pl√§switz with Napoleon on 4 June. If Russia and Prussia made a permanent peace with the French Empire, then Wellington would have to give up any possible territorial gains that he made in France. As it happened, the Truce ended on 11 August and the Austrian Empire joined the Allies, though Wellington did not know this until 7 September. Other reasons were that the British and Portuguese had not fully established their new supply line via the port of Santander, the army was experiencing serious straggling and there was political trouble with the Cortes of C√°diz. Wellington's offensive that ended at Vitoria began in late May. While his army was preparing to lunge forward, four French divisions under Clausel were far away in the Pyrenees trying to hunt down Francisco Espoz y Mina and his Spanish guerillas. On 12‚Äì13 May, Clausel attacked Mina's base at Roncal but the guerilla leader escaped its destruction and the subsequent French pursuit. Meanwhile, Clausel's troops were not available to help the main French army opposing Wellington. Joseph sent Clausel a note asking for the return of three borrowed divisions on 27 May, but Clausel's column only appeared in the neighborhood of Vitoria a day after the decisive battle. Belatedly realizing the situation, the French general immediately began to retreat. On 26 June, intelligence was received that Clausel's column was within reach, prompting Wellington to order a pursuit. Siege =June‚ÄìJuly= After a few days of hard marching, Wellington gave up the futile chase of Clausel's column on 29 June and turned his four divisions back toward Pamplona. The Portuguese and 2nd Divisions under Hill left Pamplona on 2 July and headed north. The 7th and Light Divisions followed Hill's corps on 3 and 4 July respectively. This left the 3rd, 4th and 6th Divisions under the command of George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie to carry on the blockade. Since O'Donnell's 11,000 men of the Army of Reserve of Andalusia had recently forced the surrender of the Pancorbo forts, on 2 July Wellington ordered the Spaniard to bring his troops to blockade Pamplona. The old Pamplona walls are still preserved. Before his operations against Mina in May, Clausel had deposited 54 field guns in the fortress at Pamplona. On 15 June a convoy arrived from France with food for 2,500 men for 77 days. After wrecking Mina's base, Clausel returned to Pamplona on 18 June, leaving Cassan and a garrison that included the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 52nd Line Infantry Regiment, the 4th Battalion of the 117th Line and 800 men from the 3rd Legion of Gendarmerie. When his beaten army passed Pamplona, Joseph and Jourdan sent their unfit and sick soldiers into the fortress, as well as 40 men captured from the 71st Foot at Vitoria. These were soon joined by several hundred stragglers which Cassan organized into a \\"battalion of detachments\\". At the start of the siege he commanded a garrison of 3,800 soldiers and 80 heavy guns mounted on the walls. Battle of the Pyrenees - 25 July 1813 with Pamplona at lower center While the Anglo- Portuguese divisions blockaded the town, military engineers constructed nine redoubts at a distance of 1,200 to 1,500 yards from the fortress, each redoubt being garrisoned by 200‚Äì300 men and equipped with field guns captured at Vitoria. O'Donnell's troops arrived at Pamplona on 12 July, releasing Dalhousie's three Anglo-Portuguese divisions for field operations. O'Donnell's 14,183 soldiers were organized into two divisions of infantry under Generals Creagh and Echevarri and a brigade of cavalry led by General Barcena. Creagh had 6,454 men in seven battalions, Echevarri commanded 6,617 soldiers in seven battalions, Barcena led 828 troopers in two regiments, and there were 284 artillerists. The fortress of Pamplona sat on the south bank of the Arga River, surrounded by walls. A powerful citadel was located on the south side of the fortress. Two outlying forts were abandoned and demolished by Cassan because they required over-large garrisons. Wellington insisted that no formal siege be undertaken and refused to send any of his heavy artillery pieces to reinforce O'Donnell's 12 field pieces. The Allied siege guns were reserved for the Siege of San Sebasti√°n. The Spanish blockade was maintained by setting up an inner cordon of pickets around the city. The outer cordon incorporated fortified villages and the nine redoubts constructed by the engineers, each armed with two cannons. So effective was the blockade that not one communication passed between the garrison and Marshal Soult. On 26 July, Cassan's garrison heard the distant sounds of battle to the northeast in the direction of Roncevaux Pass. The noise came from a skirmish fought between Clausel's corps and Lowry Cole's 4th Division at Lizo√°in. The next day, Thomas Picton's 3rd Division and Pablo Morillo's Spanish division began occupying positions near the city, indicating that French forces might be nearby. O'Donnell's Spanish division on the south side of Pamplona marched away to join the other Allies in the afternoon. There was a brief opportunity for Cassan to march his garrison through the gap and escape to the east. However, he wanted to be in control of the city when Soult's relief army broke through, so the chance passed. On 27 June Cassan mounted a sortie toward Villava on the north side of the fortress, but it failed to press back the Allied defenders. That night the campfires of Maximilien Sebastien Foy's French division were visible away. The Battle of Sorauren began on 28 July but no French troops appeared and Foy's troops were blocked by Picton's. That day, Carlos de Espa√±a's Spanish division arrived to plug the gap on the south side of Pamplona. The next day was quiet, but on 30 July there were noises of another battle. As the day wore on, the sounds receded to the northwest and it was clear that Soult's relief army was retreating. =August‚ÄìOctober= Carlos de Espa√±a Despite the great disappointment of witnessing the failed relief of the city, Cassan managed to hold his soldiers to their duty for three more months. The Spanish sent emissaries to the garrison to announce Allied victories at the Battle of San Marcial on 31 August and the Battle of the Bidassoa on 7 October in order to convince the French that their position was hopeless. However, Cassan was determined to hold out until his food was gone. The countryside close to the walls of Pamplona was fertile land with many wheat fields and gardens. From July through September, the lands near the city were the focus of many foraging parties sent by Cassan to bring in food. Typically, the French commander would send out a sudden sortie of 500 soldiers that broke through the inner cordon of pickets. The troops would harvest wheat or dig up potatoes until a superior force of Spanish soldiers appeared on the scene. Then the French would withdraw within Pamplona with the food that they gleaned. On 9 September, de Espa√±a was wounded in the thigh in a skirmish with a French foraging party. After there were no more crops to be gathered, Cassan launched sorties to gather firewood and horse-fodder. The French commander put his garrison on half-rations at the end of September. Cassan tried to send the civilian population out of Pamplona, but de Espa√±a ordered them to be fired upon and they fled back into the city. The French eventually killed and ate all the horses of the mounted gendarmes. In desperation, the starving soldiers killed dogs, cats and rats and then dug up roots, some of which turned out to be poison hemlock. In October, there were 1,000 men in hospital, many of them ill with scurvy. At this time, a stream of deserters began tricking out of the city; these were mostly Germans, Italians, Belgians and Spaniards who had joined the pro-French forces. Cassan sent out an officer to negotiate a surrender on 24 October. Cassan proposed to de Espa√±a that he and his garrison be allowed to march out with six cannons and their baggage and be allowed to join Soult. In reply, de Espa√±a insisted on unconditional surrender. Cassan then threatened to blow up the Pamplona fortifications and fight his way to the French frontier. Later, he admitted in his report to the French government that this was pure bluff, since his starving soldiers could hardly march three miles. De Espa√±a countered by pointing out that there were 25,000 Allied soldiers between Pamplona and the frontier. The Spanish general promised that if the French blew up the fortress, he would order his men to take no prisoners and that the peasants would probably kill anyone who escaped. Wellington wrote a letter to de Espa√±a that the French officers should be shot and the common soldiers decimated if they damaged the city. Cassan then proposed that his soldiers be exchanged on the promise to not fight against the Allies for a year and one day. De Espa√±a refused, pointing out that France was infamous for not honoring its pledges. Finally, Cassan had to accept terms which allowed his soldiers to march out with the honors of war, but lay down their arms from the gates and be sent to prison camps in England. Sick soldiers were also considered to be prisoners, though they were available for exchange. French civil servants might be exchanged for Spanish nationals held in France and French women, children and men over 60 years old could go free. However, Spanish and British deserters, as well as pro-French Spanish subjects (men and women) were to be turned over to their captors. Some of this group were executed by the Spanish. Supposedly a number of Spaniards escaped exemplary punishment by donning French uniforms or pretending to be French women. Result Historian Digby Smith gave French losses as 500 killed, 800 wounded, and 2,150 captured while estimating that the 10,000-strong Spanish besiegers sustained 2,000 casualties during the siege. Charles Oman stated that, at the end of September, de Espa√±a's division numbered 3,200 men and O'Donnell's remaining division counted 5,000 soldiers, while there were 700 cavalry and 300 gunners. In round numbers there were about 9,500 men. At this time O'Donnell's division was replaced by 5,000 troops led by the Prince of Anglona. Oman noted that it was fortunate that the negotiations ended in a peaceful surrender, because de Espa√±a's behavior during the First Carlist War showed that he was cruel enough to resort to massacre. Wellington believed that the Spanish besiegers were lax in allowing the French to successfully forage for food. The British commander thought that if the wheat fields had been burned and the gardens ruined that Pamplona would have fallen three weeks earlier. In fact, Cassan's ability to hold out into the autumn forced Wellington to keep Hill's corps at the Roncevaux Pass where it endured constant rain and snow that put many soldiers in the hospital. More significantly, Wellington refused to order his army to move into France until Pamplona had fallen. By this measure, Cassan performed a good service to his emperor.

She made two voyages to New South Wales, during the first of which she transported convicts, and during the second of which she went whale and seal hunting. Her crew's interaction with the MƒÅori at New Zealand sparked the Sealers' War, a long-running violent feud between sealers and whalers on the one hand, and the MƒÅori on the other. She was last listed in 1823.

This information repeats for 1807, with the addition of armament.Lloyd's Register (1807), Seq.‚ÑñS881. Plummer (of Plummer, Barham and Company) was only the nominal owner of Sydney Cove. The true owners were Lord, Cable and Underwood. Under the command of William Edwards, she sailed from Falmouth, England on 11 January 1807, and arrived at Port Jackson on 18 June. She carried four male and 113 female convicts, of whom three female convicts died on the voyage. Sydney Cove left Port Jackson on 26 October bound for England. She was carrying cargo (including skins), and passengers from Commerce. At St Helena Daniel Cooper, who had been sailing on her, took over command for the remainder of the journey home.Entwisle (2010), Chap. 2. skins that she brought home with her sold in London in 1809 (after Plummer's expenses), for ¬£ 6636 6s 6d. Plummer had kept them off a glutted market and when he sold them he received only 4s per skin, net, having earlier turned down a better offer. Under Captain M'Larin Sydney Cove arrived at Port Jackson again on 14 April 1808. She had gathered both whale oil and seal skins. When she left on 18 July 1809, her destination was given as \\"Fishery\\". In 1810 she was at Otago Harbour while her crew were working at Cape Saunders on the Otago Peninsula. The theft, by a MƒÅori chief, of a red shirt, a knife, and several other items from her led sailors on Sydney Cove to attack the chief, wounding him fatally. This is believed to have led to more than a decade of conflict throughout southern New Zealand. Sydney Cove and her boats moved to the Molyneux ‚Äì the modern Clutha River Mouth ‚Äì where they attacked and killed another chief.

Sydney Cove then paused at Stewart Island before continuing her voyage. Sydney Cove returned to London on 18 August 1810 with either 8 or 18 crew members, having ignited an ongoing blood feud between sealers and MƒÅori. Sydney Cove left London on 8 October 1810 with a crew of 24 men.Enwisle (2010), fn. 106. She returned to London in 1811.with sperm oil and seal skins.

Print. The debates over the legitimacy of Chinese philosophy primarily concern the indigenous philosophy of China. They range in their central focus: whether the discipline of ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù existed in traditional Chinese thought; whether the subjects and issues involved in the discipline existed in Chinese thought; and whether the now established discipline of Chinese philosophy can be truly be considered Chinese. These contentions have led to larger questions about the nature of philosophy and its discipline. Academic Discipline of Chinese Philosophy The discipline of philosophy did not enter China until the 19th century. Nishi Amane, a Japanese scholar, first translated the term ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù into Chinese as zhexue (wisdom learning) in 1873. Though he originally coined this term solely to refer to the concept of Western Philosophy, he argued that the nature of the discipline of philosophy was in a constant flux, thus creating an opening for the realm of Chinese philosophy. After the Western infusion at the turn of the 20th century, an emulation of the Western educational system and its way of categorization spread through China.p.69, Gan, Chunsong. \\"Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the ‚ÄúLegitimacy of Chinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005).

The Chinese philosophy of the past included classical learning (jinxue), the learning of the ancient masters (zhuzixue) speculative learning (xuanxue), Buddhist learning, and learning of principle (lixue). While all these branches share common elements with Western philosophy, it was definitively decided that these were not philosophy in their original state. Hence, there was the subsequent distillation by later scholars using Western notions to form a history of Chinese philosophy.p.35, Yu, Xuanmeng. \\"On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006).

Chinese philosophy developed under the paradigm of Western philosophy, rather than the other way around, because of the prevalent view in the early twentieth century of the superiority of Western culture. With advanced military, technology, and a wider dissemination of culture, Western systems of knowledge attained a ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù quality that relegated Chinese paradigms as ‚Äúlocal particularities.‚Äùp.82, Gan, Chunsong. \\"Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the ‚ÄúLegitimacy of Chinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005).

Yet because any global contact will most likely stimulate change, the transformation of traditional Chinese academics can be seen as both an imposition by the West, as well as a conscious choice by the Chinese to move towards a seemingly inevitable direction. Arguments Against the Legitimacy of Chinese Philosophy =Misinterpretation of Chinese Thought= The lack of a formal system in traditional Chinese philosophy motivates the creation of a ‚Äúsystemic overcoat.‚Äù There is no historical narrative in Chinese philosophy similar to the one that exists in Western philosophy.p.15, Zheng, Jiadong. \\"The Issue of the ‚ÄúLegitimacy‚Äù of Chinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005).

Yet, they also conceded that at that point in time, the Western mode of thought was the only method to convey Chinese philosophy.p.46, Ge, Zhaoguang. \\"Why Is It the ‚ÄúHistory of Thought‚Äù?: Reflections on the ‚ÄúChinese Philosophy‚Äù Issue.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005).

Along the same vein, a few decades prior to Fu Sinian and Hu Shih's studies there were similar ideas forming in Japan, particularly among the intellectual society known as the Meiji Six Society, as they attempted to introduce Western philosophy to Japan in order to bridge the intellectual gap between the East and the West. Now, modern philosophical scholars when referencing these ancient texts in their own work, reconstruct these studies and create a logical system that do not retain the spirit of these works. There is a dispute over whether the retention of the traditional Chinese spirit is necessary for the label of Chinese philosophy.p.5, Defoort, Carine, and Ge Zhaoguang. \\"Editors' Introduction.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005).

Print. The modern logical reasoning system of Western philosophy renders it closer to the sciences, while Chinese philosophy stems from history and can be considered a religion. Scholars whose studies involve an examination of Western philosophy have concluded that the presence of ontology is what makes Western philosophy distinct. However, ontology is not present in traditional Chinese philosophy, which again brings up the issue of whether to the term ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù is appropriate.p.35, Yu, Xuanmeng. \\"On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006).

Arguments For the Legitimacy of Chinese Philosophy =Ambiguous definition of ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù= There has never been a complete consensus of the definition of ‚Äúphilosophy.‚Äù If there is to be an argument for a solely Western connotation of philosophy, then the concept of philosophy should be widened to include Chinese thought.

Similarly, Chinese philosophy centers on self-cultivation and thus developed towards ren [benevolence] in self-conduct.p.38, Yu, Xuanmeng. \\"On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006).

Print. The works of the ancient masters resemble premodern/ancient Western philosophy more so than post- Kantian thought, which could be considered a link to philosophy. =Universal topics discussed in Chinese philosophy= The topics discussed in ancient Chinese thought are universal in philosophy, the term used generally. The term ‚Äúphilosophy,‚Äù itself, may not have existed, but the same subject matters were discussed. These include topics such as humanity, human nature, and principle. Deep reflections of life manifest in a multitude of cultures. Mou Zongsan used the concept of the particular and universal in explaining the compatibility of Chinese and Western philosophy: each views the world through their own narrow aperture, but through this aperture, each can attain the truth.p.18, Zheng, Jiadong. ‚ÄúThe Issue of the ‚ÄúLegitimacy‚Äù of Chinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005).

Rather than a form of academic thought, philosophy meant a path towards truth and wisdom. Despite the differences in methodology, both the ancient Greeks and ancient Chinese discussed the same topics.p.66, Hu, Jun. \\"The Legitimacy of the Discussions on the ‚ÄúLegitimacy‚Äù of ‚ÄúChinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006).

Print. Moreover, in order to assert the legitimacy of Chinese philosophy, many Chinese scholars have argued that it is more than just an ethics-based philosophy. They claim that it contains a metaphysical nature and is both transcendental and immanent. However, the religious nature of this argument has caused sharp criticism from Western sinologists.p.39, Yu, Xuanmeng. \\"On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print. The Crisis Over the Legitimacy of Chinese Philosophy The recent flare up of the debates over the legitimacy of Chinese philosophy has been brought upon by a variety of issues. First, there is the lack of recognition from Western colleagues of the legitimacy of this field. Moreover, there is disagreement over appropriate uses of methodology and terminology. The main concern is how scholars can narrate the history of Chinese philosophy in a manner that allows for comprehensive understanding of the topics touched upon. For at the moment, the Western systematic overcoat creates a Chinese history of philosophy that seems incomplete due to the lack of total overlap between China and the West.p.85, Gan, Chunsong. \\"Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the ‚ÄúLegitimacy of Chinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print. In addition, there is disagreement over the quality of contemporary research on ancient Chinese thought. Yu Wujin noted especially a lack of knowledge of both philosophy and classical Chinese texts, lack of perspective, weak abstract thinking, in addition to copying and plagiarizing.p.86, Gan, Chunsong. \\"Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the ‚ÄúLegitimacy of Chinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print. It is important to note that most do not see these debates over the value of Chinese philosophy, but rather its future. Legitimacy of the ‚ÄúLegitimacy‚Äù of ‚ÄúChinese Philosophy‚Äù To interpret Chinese thought as philosophy requires a complete understanding of both fields of Eastern and Western thought. Those who have undertaken this interpretation have been trained in a (Western) philosophical discourse that underlies any study of Chinese thought and directs these studies in a corresponding philosophical manner. Their conclusion has been that philosophical models are not compatible with Chinese models of thought. However, since these scholars themselves have been immersed in the philosophical model, objective evaluation between the two fields becomes impossible.p.63, Hu, Jun. \\"The Legitimacy of the Discussions on the ‚ÄúLegitimacy‚Äù of ‚ÄúChinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print. There can be no impartial evaluation because these discussions must stand outside the realm of both philosophy and Chinese thought.p.63, Hu, Jun. \\"The Legitimacy of the Discussions on the ‚ÄúLegitimacy‚Äù of ‚ÄúChinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print. The focus on the methodologies of interpretation rather than the actual text blocks the more significant matter of whether the original material itself can be considered philosophy. A rejection of the concept of ‚ÄúChinese philosophy‚Äù does not answer this question.p.5, Defoort, Carine, and Ge Zhaoguang. \\"Editors' Introduction.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print. However, it does help shape the direction for the future of Chinese thought. The acceptance of Chinese thought as a philosophy will only occur if this new field can deepen understanding of fundamental philosophical problems outside of its cultural context.p.20, Zheng, Jiadong. \\"The Issue of the ‚ÄúLegitimacy‚Äù of Chinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print. Final Analysis and Possible Solutions As a result of this debate, it has been suggested that the legitimacy of Western philosophy must also be considered anew. It is only logical that if there is an examination of Chinese thought by the standards of Western philosophy, there must be a reciprocal examination as well.p.21, Zheng, Jiadong. \\"The Issue of the ‚ÄúLegitimacy‚Äù of Chinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005).

However, just as the argument goes that Chinese thought cannot be made to fit to the standards of Western philosophy, the reverse is as true.p.71, Qiao, Qingju. \\"Western Discourse and Shadows in the Legitimacy Crisis of Chinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print. Another solution proposed is the introduction of more methodologies in order to have more philosophical interpretations to replace the uniform approaches of the 20th century. Since Chinese and Western philosophies are different forms of philosophy, it follows that the two should have distinct forms of expression.p.86, Gan, Chunsong. \\"Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the ‚ÄúLegitimacy of Chinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print. However, China has not had one solitary mode of expression through its history of philosophy. There has been a range in the subjects discussed and the means of discussion. Therein lies a primary difference of Chinese philosophy: its value does not lie in the organization of its thinking, but rather whether it can answer significantly the issues of the times.p.87, Gan, Chunsong. \\"Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the ‚ÄúLegitimacy of Chinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print. A history of Chinese philosophy may as well coexist alongside a history of Chinese thought. While Chinese philosophy would remain the particular Chinese ideas that coincide with Western philosophies, Chinese thought would retain the wider spectrum of general knowledge, thoughts, and beliefs that are more applicable in a societal setting and which are included in classical Chinese texts.p.47, Ge, Zhaoguang. \\"Why Is It the ‚ÄúHistory of Thought‚Äù?: Reflections on the ‚ÄúChinese Philosophy‚Äù Issue.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005).

A return to the traditional form of Chinese learning seems implausible at this time, as Chinese universities have divided their disciplines in the same manner as the West; as a result, philosophic thinking will most likely follow in the Western direction.p.35, Yu, Xuanmeng. \\"On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print. In addition, a complete rejection of the term ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù concerning Chinese thought would isolate this field from Western contemporaries making it irrelevant. Instead, much emphasis has been placed on the special nature of Chinese philosophy in an attempt to highlight the inherent differences.p.84, Gan, Chunsong. \\"Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the ‚ÄúLegitimacy of Chinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print. Another solution is to consider all research done thus far on the history of Chinese philosophy as comparative research. Such studies are beneficial in that they allow new perspectives and reveal the unique characteristics of each type of philosophy.p.72, Qiao, Qingju. \\"Western Discourse and Shadows in the Legitimacy Crisis of Chinese Philosophy.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print. Yu Xuanmeng advocates a new structure for comparative study between Western and Chinese philosophy that grants them both the presence of transcendence, though through different means. The Western definition of transcendental means a property-transcending-experience. He reasons that the extension of life in time ‚Äì that is, the conscious choices made by man of how to involve himself with the world after he examines himself ‚Äì is also a type of transcendence.p.39, Yu, Xuanmeng. \\"On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types.\\" Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006).

Duke of Portland sailed on 13 December 1806, or 19 February 1807 under the command of Captain John Spence, and in company with Lively and Ranger. The ships sailed with the India Fleet under the escort of . The convoy parted when Duke of Portland made for Rio de Janeiro. She arrived at Sydney on 27 July 1807. Duke of Portland embarked 189 convicts, and disembarked 189, having lost none; other reports state that three convicts died on the voyage and that two died later. Duke of Portland left Port Jackson on 7 or 10 November bound for England. She was carrying a cargo of oil, sealskins, and lumber. She returned to Britain on 19 April 1808. On 14 July 1808, or 3 August 1808, Duke of Portland, Spence, master, sailed again from England, and arrived at Port Jackson again on 24 January 1809. This time she was carrying stores, not prisoners. She left for England in May. Apparently, she first visited Guadalupe Island, off the California coast and took on a cargo of seal oil and skins. She next put into at Honolulu in February 1810. Duke of Portland left on 4 March, having spent several weeks there. Before her departure, King Kamehameha I entrusted Spence with a letter to King George III and several gifts, which Spence delivered on his return to England. Duke of Portland sought cargoes and whales, but without success and she returned to England. She arrived there on 17 August 1810. Duke of Portland is last listed in Lloyd's Register in 1808, still with Daniel Bennett as owner. There exist records that indicate that she made two more whaling voyages, both to the Island of Desolation. She left in September 1810 with John Matley as master. He died of natural causes on 12 December and his grave is on Matley Island, a small tidal island in Baie Norv√©gienne, in the Kerguelen Islands. She then sailed again in 1811 with Spence as master. Spence brought with him a gravestone, which Matley's widow had had made, and placed it on Matley's grave. Duke of Portland is last listed in the Register of Shipping in 1811 with J.

Jeans's theorem is most often discussed in the context of potentials characterized by three, global integrals. In such potentials, all of the orbits are regular, i.e. non-chaotic; the Kepler potential is one example. In generic potentials, some orbits respect only one or two integrals and the corresponding motion is chaotic. Jeans's theorem can be generalized to such potentials as follows: > The phase-space density of a stationary stellar system is constant within > every well-connected region. A well-connected region is one that cannot be decomposed into two finite regions such that all trajectories lie, for all time, in either one or the other. Invariant tori of regular orbits are such regions, but so are the more complex parts of phase space associated with chaotic trajectories. Integrability of the motion is therefore not required for a steady state.

Route description  Delmar Boulevard starts at North 14th Street in Downtown St. Louis, as a westward extension of Convention Plaza. It passes through the neighborhoods of Downtown West and Midtown on its easternmost portions. Just west of Jefferson Avenue, at number 2658, is the Scott Joplin House State Historic Site. Delmar is interrupted at Spring Avenue by Cardinal Ritter College Prep High School; the street picks up again at Vandeventer Avenue, two blocks to the west. At Taylor Avenue, Delmar (which has been traveling west- northwest up to this point) assumes a more due westerly course. Between here and Skinker Boulevard, the boulevard passes through the neighborhoods of Vandeventer, Lewis Place, Fountain Park, Academy, Visitation Park, West End, and Skinker/DeBaliviere, passing many disused and derelict buildings. West of the MetroLink tracks at Rosedale Avenue, Delmar's character changes as the street enters the Delmar Loop, a neighborhood popular with students of nearby Washington University in St. Louis and known for many eclectic shops and restaurants. The Delmar Loop is home to several area landmarks, such as the Tivoli Theater and Blueberry Hill. On the Loop, just west of Skinker, Delmar leaves the City of St. Louis and enters the St. Louis County suburb of University City. West of Trinity Avenue, Delmar climbs a hill out of the Loop. Beyond this point, Delmar changes to a largely residential character, which it assumes for the rest of its route. After about two miles, Delmar crosses Interstate 170, where it has an interchange (Exit 2), before coming to an end at Price Road shortly thereafter. Delmar is often considered to represent a major socioeconomic divide in the city, having come to demarcate the poorer, largely African American neighborhoods located to the north from the more affluent (and largely white) ones to the south; this phenomenon is called the \\"Delmar Divide\\".  Transportation  A Loop Trolley car on Delmar Blvd. in University City Delmar Boulevard is served by the Loop Trolley line, which opened in November 2018, and by Delmar station on MetroLink, St. Louis' light- rail line connecting the airport with downtown. The Hodiamont streetcar ran a few blocks north of Delmar, connecting Hodiamont Avenue with Enright Avenue west of Vandeventer. The old right-of-way still exists as an alley, and is marked as \\"Hodiamont Streetcar R-O-W\\" or \\"Suburban Track\\" on many maps of the area.  History  Delmar was originally known as Morgan Street until 1933. According to Norbury L. Wayman in his circa 1980 series History of St. Louis Neighborhoods,Norbury L. Wayman: History of St. Louis neighborhoods, St. Louis, Mo., circa 1980 series, St. Louis Community Development Agency. the name Delmar was coined when two early landowners living on opposite sides of the road, one from Delaware and one from Maryland, combined the names of their home states. The town of Delmar, Delaware, on the border between the two states, derived its name in similar fashion. In 2009, the portion of Delmar within the city of St. Louis was given the honorary name of Barack Obama Boulevard to honor the newly elected president.

Role and powers in mythology Sharur plays a prominent role in an incident in which Ninurta is described as using it to defeat Asag, a monstrous demon; Sharur has the power to fly across vast distances without impediment and communicate with its wielder. This myth receives its most complete treatment in the epic Lugal-e, which in English is rendered as \\"The Exploits of Ninurta (O Warrior King)\\". (alternate copy) According to this text, Sharur's role in the battle is not only as a weapon. It provides crucial intelligence to the hero, acting as an emissary between the god Enlil and Ninurta and relating to him the former's will, including a command to slay the architect Kur, a primeval serpent god venerated in Babylon, as well as a strategy to defeat Asag. Kur is associated with mountains and the primordial elements.

Biography  Anderson was born in New Jersey as one of ten children of William Anderson (1814 ‚Äì 1887), a civil engineer turned Dutch Reformed Church Reverend, and Sarah Louise Ryerson (1818‚Äì1907). After an initial career as a businessman, on June 15, 1876 Anderson married Elizabeth Milbank, the reform-minded daughter of the investor Jeremiah Milbank and an heiress to his considerable fortune. Beginning in the mid-1870s, Anderson studied art in Paris, first with L√©on Bonnat, then under Alexandre Cabanel, Fernand Cormon, Auguste Rodin, and Rapha√´l Collin.Ackerman, Gerald M. American Orientalists. p. 270.New York Times obituary, April 28, 1940 Anderson developed a reputation for his portraits. His 1889 portrait of Thomas Alva Edison is in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C. In 1890, Anderson organized the American Art Association in Paris, a beneficial mutual-aid society for American art students. He was its president until 1912; it lasted until 1932. Portrait of Thomas Edison (1890), National Portrait Gallery Bryant Park Studios, NYC In 1900, Anderson commissioned the 10-story Bryant Park Studios building from the New York society architect Charles A. Rich. Situated on the south side of Bryant Park, its generous windows and high-ceilings were designed specifically for artists. Anderson maintained his own suite on the top floor until the end of his life. Bryant Park Studios (popularly known as The Beaux Arts Building after the Caf√© des Beaux Arts\\"Drinks Chosen for Color, Not Taste, at Women's Bar\\", New York Times, October 12, 1913, page X2. on the ground floor) became immediately popular, and tenants included Edward Steichen, Fernand L√©ger, Robert Henri, Katherine Sophie Dreier, J.

Returning to the United States in the summers, Anderson bought land in northwestern Wyoming and developed it into the Palette Ranch. He personally designed William \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody's guest ranch Pahaska Tepee, and his own home, Anderson Lodge. That lodge became the first administrative headquarters for the Yellowstone Forest Reserve in 1902, as President Theodore Roosevelt named Anderson as the first Special Superintendent of Forest Reserves. Anderson played a significant role in the preservation and development of the Yellowstone region.NRHP Registration Form for Anderson Lodge, His autobiography, Experiences and Impressions, was published in 1933.

The brand has experienced some Since its relaunching in 2010, Signia has been the official uniform provider of the Argentine Olympic Committee. History =First years: TyC= The brand made its debut in 1999 as \\"TyC Signia\\". TyC was the acronym of Torneos y Competencias, an Argentine company created by Carlos Avila which had signed an agreement with the Argentine Football Association to be the exclusive broadcaster of all the Primera Divisi√≥n football matches. The company expanded its business, creating a sportswear division due to its partnership with Gatic S.A., the Argentine textile manufacturing company which had the exclusive license of international brands such as Adidas (since 1970), Le Coq Sportif, New Balance, Arena, and Umbro amongst others to produce and sell their products in the region.Lo que hicieron con Gatic no tiene nombre by Tom√°s Labrit (interview to Eduardo Bakchellian), 2 Aug 2018 on Peri√≥dico El Barrio However, the incomes of the company had strongly decreased during the last years, due to the Argentine economic crisis. TyC and Gatic signed an agreement with the objective of creating, developing and commercialising the \\"TyC Signia\\" brand, which was officially released in April 2009. Signia was conceived as an exclusive brand focused on high-performance products, in order to compete with other premium sports brands.TyC lanza una l√≠nea de indumentaria, La Naci√≥n, 23 April 1999 Despite being supported with massive advertisement campaigns, the sales of the TyC Signia products were poor, as well its repercussion as a new brand. This caused the first restructuring of the company just one year later, when it was renamed simply as \\"Signia\\". Soon after, Signia signed its first agreements with some Primera Divisi√≥n football teams, such as San Lorenzo de Almagro and Los Andes, which played its third run on Primera Divisi√≥n wearing Signia equipment. Signia designed some uniforms for San Lorenzo that were controversial, such as the black model (inspired by both, the nicknamed of the club, cuervo ‚Äìraven‚Äì and the colour of father Lorenzo Massa's cassock), with a yellow sleeve to supposedly represented a raven peak.La otra camiseta negra on Mundo Azulgrana, 4 Dec 2018 The model debuted in a match vs. River Plate, which would be the only time it was worn so the club recalled the jersey despite sales were good. Another model made by Signia for San Lorenzo was a silver kit, a rare jersey at the time, worn in the 2000 Copa Mercosur.San Lorenzo es el arte de la elegancia, Clar√≠n, 3 August 2000 Although Gatic had the exclusive license to manufacture the Adidas products in Argentina, the German company had settled in the country during the 1990s, becoming Gatic's main rival. In 2002, Adidas decided to end its partnership with Gatic, after the Argentine company called to a creditor's meeting. The 2001 Argentine economic collapse and the high price of the dollar stopped the entry of imported products (which had relegated the sporting goods manufactured in Argentina during the decade of the 1990s due to their lower costs) to the country. That situation encouraged Eduardo Bakchellian (the old owner of Gatic) to take Gatic over again in 2002. The company would be not a licensor but a manufacturer and provider of products for other brands such as Adidas (its former licensor) or Nike, which had arrived to Argentina a few years before. =Relaunching= Once the agreement with TyC concluded, Bakchellian searched for a new partner to relaunch Signia. The company finally signed an agreement with TV businessman Marcelo Tinelli, who had created a volleyball team in Bolivar, Buenos Aires Province (his home town). Therefore, the team was renamed \\"Bol√≠var Signia\\" with the company as its main sponsor and uniform manufacturer. During its second era, Signia continued sponsoring San Lorenzo but also incorporated Arsenal de Sarand√≠, Hurac√°n and Comisi√≥n de Actividades Infantiles to its list of endorsements. The most successful rugby union team of Argentina, Club Atl√©tico San Isidro (mostly known as CASI) also signed with Signia. In 2003, Signia signed a deal with the Argentine Football Association becoming the exclusive ball provider for all the Primera Divisi√≥n matches. This agreement ended in 2004.\\"Cuesti√≥n de pelotas\\" by Gustavo Veiga, P√°gina/12, 2003-01-20 In September 2004, Gatic was finally declared bankruptcy and went into liquidation. The factory located in San Mart√≠n Partido was taken over by its former employees, being assisted by an international NGO. The other Gatic factories (the textile in Las Flores and the shoes manufacturer of Coronel Su√°rez) were rented by a recently created company, Indular Manufacturas S.A. =Third period= Taekwondo athlete Sebasti√°n Crismanich wearing Signia official equipment, August 2012 Indular Manufacturas kept the Signia brand, while the rest of former Gatic brands were dismissed or acquired by other companies. Signia had ceased sponsoring teams during the period of bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the company signed deals with more teams in 2006: Argentinos Juniors and Gimnasia y Esgrima de Jujuy. One year later Signia added Belgrano de C√≥rdoba and Lan√∫s to its list of teams sponsored. In July 2007 Indular Manufacturas was acquired by Brazilian company Vulcabras, owner of Olympikus and part of the Grendene Group. Soon after arriving to Argentina, Vulcabras (through its brand Olympikus) began its business in the region, taking over the teams sponsored by Signia at the time: Lan√∫s (in 2009) and Argentinos Juniors (in 2010).\\"Racing de estreno: nuevo sponsor y camiseta\\", Racing Club website, 2009-12-29 As a result, Signia disappeared from the sports business for a while. =Fourth run: 2010‚Äìpresent= In August 2010, Signia made a new appearance in the Argentine sports market, signing a deal with All Boys, which had promoted to Primera Divisi√≥n that same year. The brand was relaunched by a new company called GGM S.A., which also obtained the license to manufacture and commercialize the Pony products in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. Signia also signed an agreement with the Argentine Olympic Committee to provide equipment to its athletes during the Summer Olympics and Pan American Games, ending in 2016.

His grandfather Fred Keays represented both Fitzroy and Collingwood in the Victorian Football League. Keays was just 16 years of age when he began playing senior VFL football in 1987, the youngest Collingwood footballer to debut since Rene Kink and Stephen Clifford in 1973. A utility, he played 10 games in his debut season and also represented Victoria in the Teal Cup that year.The Age,\\"Victoria trounces SA in Teal Cup\\", 9 July 1987, p. 37 Keays added just four games to his tally over the next two seasons, then made six appearances in 1990, a premiership year, the last of which was in round 20. Keays was traded to Richmond for the fourth pick in the 1990 AFL Draft, which Collingwood used to secure Jason McCartney. Keays missed just one game in the first 14 rounds of the 1991 AFL season, which was in between a five-goal haul in a win over Fitzroy and a seven-goal effort against Footscray at Western Oval. By the end of the season he had amassed 27 goals, placing him third in the Richmond goal-kicking behind Jeff Hogg (68) and Chris Naish (38). In 1993 he played with the Frankston Football Club and although he was picked up again by Collingwood in the Mid-Season Draft, he didn't play another league game for the club.

The battle was initiated by Muzaffar Jung and supported by Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix and led by Chanda Sahib, who sought to overthrow Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan, the Nawab of the Carnatic, for supporting Nasir Jung's claim to be Nizam of Hyderabad. French forces were decisive in giving the allies victory; Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan was killed in the battle and Chanda Sahib seized control of the Carnatic.  Background  Since the beginning of the Second Carnatic War Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan, the Nawab of the Carnatic, had warned the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah of an irreversible power struggle in the Carnatic and how he wanted his interests to be legitimized by Nizam-ul-Mulk, the Nizam of Hyderabad who had nominated him in the first place. Nizam-ul-Mulk died in 1748 and was succeeded as Nizam by his grandson Muzaffar Jung. This decision was confirmed by the Mughal Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur but rejected by Nasir Jung, Nizam-ul-Mulk's son, who captured the city of Hyderabad after a coup. Muzaffar Jung fled Hyderabad and tried to gain new allies. He received the support of the French Governor- General Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix, who helped release Chanda Sahib the son-in- law of Dost Ali Khan, who was imprisoned after being overrun by the Marathas and after his father-in-law was killed in the fray. Chanda Sahib sought the investiture of the Mughal Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur by declaring himself Nawab of Tinnevelly and gathered his own army of 3500 men and even received 400 French infantry from Dupleix. Because Muzaffar Jung was the chosen successor of Nizam-ul-Mulk his loyalists exceed 30,000. Together they marched towards Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic and sought to eliminate Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan, who supported Nasir Jung's claim to the Hyderabadi throne. Instead of entrenching himself in Arcot, Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan decided to advance towards the allied forces with his own 20,000 battle-strong army.  Battle  On 3 August 1749, the allied forces of Dupleix, Chanda Sahib and Muzaffar Jung met those of Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan at Ambur. Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan's forces managed to create a formidable stance by gathering around their howdahs despite being outnumbered 3 to 1, but it was the disciplined French infantry forces led by De Bussy that completely reversed the course of the battle against Khan. Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan was shot and killed in a fierce confrontation while commanding his forces from a howdah. The next day Muzaffar Jang and Chanda Sahib victoriously entered Arcot and Chanda Sahib became the next Nawab of the Carnatic. Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan's son, Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah, fled south to Trichinopoly, where he hid and sought the assistance of the British.  Aftermath  French East India Company influence 1741‚Äì1754. The Battle of Ambur convincingly demonstrated the superiority of European arms and methods of discipline and infantry warfare.

Distributed by Universal-International and produced by Howard Christie, it was shot in Technicolor and was released on September 16. The story is set in the early 19th century and tells of Commander David Porter and his men going undercover as pirates to fight piracy. Plot In 1823, brash naval officer David Farragut (Scott Brady) boards the Essex and informs its commander, David Porter (Jeff Chandler), that the Navy is commandeering the ship for a top-secret mission. Although the crew is overdue for shore leave, Porter, a cold, efficient leader, lies to them in order to coerce them to volunteer for the dangerous assignment. Farragut soon reunites with his old shipmate, Chief Petty Officer Link (George Mathews), who tries to convince him that Porter, who years earlier trained Farragut harshly in an attempt to teach him patience and discipline, is not as heartless as he appears. This starts to show itself when Porter later reconciles with Farragut about their past and agree to be civil with one another. Once the ship is at sea, Porter and Farragut open their orders and are dismayed to discover their mission: to disguise themselves as pirates, with no ties to or protection from the United States, in order to track down pirates raiding the West Indies. One night soon after, Farragut is in charge of the ship when a storm hits. Link becomes trapped beneath a keg of rum from which he has tried to sneak a drink and Farragut is forced to break the ship's rudder to rescue him. Porter discovers the damage, but even when he threatens to court-martial Farragut, the officer refuses to inform on Link. Within days, the supplies begin to run out, one of the crew contracts scurvy, and Porter steers the rudderless Essex to the West Indies for repairs and supplies. Farragut grows frustrated with the slow drift and, although Porter forbids anyone to enter the shark-infested waters, he tries to repair the rudder himself. When a shark attacks and Farragut's rope catches on a barnacle, he is barely rescued in time, and Porter chastises him again. Six days later, the men finally reach land and Porter orders Farragut and Link to gather supplies. Link is drunk and reported missing from his duty, and when Farragut searches the island's jungle for him, he is captured by natives. They bring Farragut to Portuguese countess Margarita La Raguna (Suzan Ball), who is in hiding. She insists at gunpoint that he take her back to the ship, but once there, she hides the pistol, causing Porter to scoff at Farragut's claim that he was forced to bring her. Margarita reveals that she and her countrymen now live in Rio de Janeiro and wish to use their gold to establish a trade route between Brazil and England. However, the newly reinstated Portuguese king has demanded that his subjects and their riches return to Portugal and abducted her ship while it was en route to England. Her father was killed and the sailing instructions for the Brazilian fleet were stolen, and she needs passage to Brazil to warn the fleet. Porter, as captivated by Margarita's beauty as is Farragut, agrees to take her on board, and as the days pass, the two men vie for her attention. One day, a Portuguese ship appears. Porter waits until the last possible moment to fly the pirate flag but is shocked when the Portuguese captain, Poulini, responds in a friendly manner. However, Margarita is furious to learn they are pirates because the Caribbean pirates, led by Scarjack, are working together with the Portuguese and the corrupt island governor, Count Domingo Del Prado, to steal her people's gold. Porter decides to return Margarita to the islands for her protection, and when she begs Farragut to try to change the captain's mind, Farragut agrees and gives her his medallion as a good luck piece. As they near the island, Margarita overhears Porter and Farragut discussing their camouflage strategy and, assuming they are in league with Del Prado, jumps off the ship and swims ashore. She is immediately captured, as is Farragut when he takes a crew to the island for more supplies. Brought before Del Prado, Margarita denounces Farragut as a pirate and throws down his medallion. Immediately recognizing it as American, Del Prado imprisons them all and tortures Farragut to reveal the ship's plans. Back on the ship, Link urges Porter to rescue Farragut, and although he risks being court-martialed for defying his orders, Porter finally agrees. The whole crew infiltrates the island and, disguised as Del Prado's soldiers, attack the dungeon. After freeing Farragut and Margarita, Porter overpowers Del Prado in a sword fight and brings him back to the ship. They make him walk the plank until he returns the Brazilian sailing instructions to Margarita. Porter then sets course for America and agrees with Link that Farragut, who is wrapped in an embrace with Margarita, has finally become a man.

Eventually the lead role was assigned to Jeff Chandler after he had impressed Universal Studios with his performance in Sword of the Desert, and his successful loanout to 20th Century Fox for Broken Arrow. \\"I don't know why I got it\\", Chandler said of the role, joking that \\"maybe it's because I'm saving them money.\\" Chandler had to secure a three-week leave of absence from Our Miss Brooks on radio to make the film. Much of the film was shot in Italy on location in Naples, Siena and Tuscany over five weeks in late 1949. Only two actors were imported from America, Chandler and M√§rta Tor√©n, with the rest coming from either Italy or France. Filming began early in 1950. Chandler's second daughter was born during the making of the film. Writer-producer Robert Buckner praised filming on location in Italy. He said Universal had set aside $300,000 in frozen currency to make the film, but he ended up using only $117,000. He said that if Chandler had not been required to return to the US to fulfil a radio commitment, requiring three weeks filming in a studio in Hollywood, another $100,000 could have been saved. The movie is said to be based on a famous Italian gangster, Lucky Luciano. Chandler denied this, saying the character he played was a small-time gangster, \\"and what happens after he lands is quite different from what happened to Luciano.

Starring the misanthropic Wilson, the book is structured as 70 one-page gag strips, with days or even years passing between the strips. Clowes says, \\"The story is really what you interpret happens in between each strip.\\" Wilson is condescending and supercilious, and insists on communicating his alienating dissatisfactions with all those he meets, even with strangers, and most often unsolicited. The middle-aged, divorced Wilson, who lives in Oakland, California, finds himself lonely, smug, and obsessed with his past. Overview The style of artwork changes from strip to strip, sometimes in Clowes' familiar tight drawing style, sometimes more exaggeratedly cartoony. The story is told in one-page segments that can be read individually, while creating a larger whole. It was printed with extremely thick and heavy cover boards. Wilson was the first book Clowes had published without first serializing it the way Ghost World and David Boring had first appeared in his comic book Eightball. Wilson was inspired by a combination of spending time with his father, who was in the hospital with a terminal condition, while also reading a biography of Charles Schulz. Clowes says his father and Schulz were alike in many ways, in physical and personality terms. Clowes brought his sketchbook with him to the hospital, and there came up with the concept of Wilson and sketches of some of the strips that would end up in the final book. Clowes later described the character as \\"a guy I could put into any situation, and I would hear his voice and he would tell me what to write.\\" The book was optioned by director Alexander Payne in a deal that would have Clowes writing the screenplay. However, Payne stated in a Parade interview dated February 24, 2014 that he was no longer involved with the project. The project was taken over by Fox Searchlight, and Wilson was filmed in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota in the summer of 2015, with Craig Johnson directing and Payne remaining on board as a producer. Woody Harrelson starred in the title role, and the film was released in 2017.

The film stars Jeff Chandler, Jack Palance, Ludmilla Tch√©rina, and Rita Gam.Sign of the Pagan at TCMDB Plot During the fifth century, the Roman Empire is divided into two parts: the West, with its capital in Rome, run by Emperor Valentinian III, and the East, with its capital in Constantinople, run by Emperor Theodosius. The Empire is under attack by the Huns under Attila. Roman soldier Marcian is carrying a message from Valentinian warning Theodosius against the Huns, when he is captured by Attila. Attila is impressed by Marcian's honesty and courage. He carves out the arrow that has been shot into his leg, causing Marcian to pass out. Over the next few days, Attila keeps Marcian hostage in the hopes of learning more about the Romans' plans. The Huns capture a local king's family and Attila orders them killed, except for the daughter, Ilduco, whom he takes as his wife. Later, when Attila's daughter, Kubra, shows off her father's prize stallion, Marcian steals it and flees to Constantinople. In Constantinople, Marcian is befriended by General Paulinus, who confides that Theodosius is planning to join forces with the Huns against Valentinian. This is confirmed when Marcian brings his emperor's message to Theodosius, who throws him out. Theodosius' sister, Princess Pulcheria, calls Marcian to her chambers. She admits that she loves Rome, but is kept prisoner within the palace walls. She names Marcian the captain of her guard, asking him to protect her from Theodosius' mutiny. That night, Theodosius holds a feast to welcome the Hun leaders. Although Attila has not been invited, he arrives to command the allegiance of all other Barbarians, and easily defeats the strongest man in Constantinople. Frightened, Theodosius offers him furs and jewels, but Attila demands only that Marcian teach the Huns how to use Roman weapons. Although Kubra is the first to practice with the weapons, Marcian deposits her in the harem bathing pool. Later, Pulcheria sends for Attila. She asks him to release Marcian from his duties, but Attila kisses her roughly and then leaves to meet Theodosius, who agrees to pay each month in return for Attila's promise not to attack. Later, Marcian also approaches the Hun, warning him that because Rome is Christian, it will never fall. Attila merely laughs at him, but when Kubra visits the church the next day, she is awed by the portrait of Mary and longs for the peace she feels there. She tries to refuse to leave, but Attila forces her to accompany the Huns out of the city. The next night, Attila gathers the Barbarian leaders and announces that they will attack Rome immediately. As soon as his soothsayer announces that the signs are positive, a bolt of lightning strikes a tree that falls on him. Although this concerns the Huns, Attila names it a good omen. Soon after, his men bring two captured monks to him, and Attila, who does not dare anger the Christian God, orders the soldiers killed. The monks then beg him not to kill the soldiers, baffling Attila. As the Huns gather outside Rome, Marcian, finding no help for Valentinian with Theodosius, prepares to flee the palace, but is captured upon stopping to bid Pulcheria goodbye. While Attila's new seer, whom he calls Persian, relates a vision of Marcian as emperor, Paulinus releases Marcian from the dungeon and the two sneak into Pulcheria's. Together, they decide to gather the army against Theodosius and install Pulcheria to the throne. After Theodosius is forced to abdicate, Pulcheria names Marcian her top general and announces her plans to travel to Rome with him and their army to help guard its walls. Meanwhile, Persian is plagued by visions of God and martyrs in the clouds calling for Attila's death, and Attila remembers an image his childhood nurse saw in which he died under the shadow of a cross. Though fearful, he continues to disregard the signs. When Marcian reaches Rome, he finds Valentinian leaving, but retains two battalions to add to his own to protect the city. That night, Attila orders the attack, but stops when Pope Leo I arrives to name Rome the temple of God and foresee Attila's downfall, as portended by the lightning strike. Afterward, Attila realizes that Kubra must have told the Pope about the lightning, and, though he is heartbroken, kills her for betraying him. In his sleep that night, he sees a vision of the martyrs marching against him and, crazed, orders the Huns to retreat. Marcian hears and immediately plans to ambush Attila when he reaches the nearest city. The surprise attack demolishes the Huns, who soon fall. Marcian finds Attila and duels with him, but it is Ildico, who has spent the last months overflowing with rage, who drives the fatal dagger into his chest. As prophesied, Attila dies with the sword's handle forming the shadow of a cross on the ground. Days later, Pulcheria reunites the halves of the empire and names Marcian emperor, to the delight of the Roman people.

Ludmilla Tch√©rina was to make her dramatic debut in the film. She was a ballerina who had been signed to a long-term contract to Universal after a series of screen tests, including some with Jeff Chandler. Chandler was assigned the male lead and Douglas Sirk given the job of directing. The movie was going to be Universal's first using Cinemascope. Jack Palance, then coming off a second Oscar nomination, soon signed to play Attila the Hun. Chandler told Hedda Hopper that the role was the best he had ever had and that the movie would be Universal's most expensive of that year. Jeff Morrow had a two-film-a-year deal with Universal and appeared in Sign of the Pagan as the second film. Allison Hayes was a model who was spotted by the wife of Earl Warren at a party in Washington. Mrs Warren suggested she try her luck in Hollywood and she succeeded in getting a contract with Universal. She played Attila's young wife; Jack Palance injured her during their love scenes. Football star Frank Gifford worked as a stuntman in some of the action scenes. Release Another film about Attila the Hun came out around the same time, Attila, starring Anthony Quinn in the title role. A novelisation of the script by Roger Fuller was published in 1955 in time for the film's release. Proposed sequel Universal bought a script by Harold Lamb, Hannibal of Carthage as a possible sequel, to also star Jack Palance. However, it was never made.

After 12 days on a raft, Donald dies, but Pike is rescued. Christina (June Allyson), the dead officer's widow, waits for a full explanation of the circumstances of her husband's death, as do his wealthy Georgia parents and sister.

Pike begins to develop feelings for Christina. He cannot bring himself to tell her that Donald was actually a poor officer and under investigation. During the ocean flight, his navigational mistake led to the crash. While on the raft, Donald proved to be a coward. Donald revealed near the end that he never loved his wife and hated his mother.

It is located at in elevation. Mining It was a coal mining town, named for Colorado Springs banker and broker John H. Pape, was inhabited by Southern European immigrants, many Italian, who came to Colorado directly after arriving in the United States at the turn of the 20th century. The town was inhabited by individuals who had mined at nearby Curtis, another mining town 1/2 a mile to the north, and moved to the town due to miner's labor issues after they were forcibly removed from their homes by strikebreakers. The 150 men, women and children were led by John Pape. The Curtis mine, established by W.W. Curtis in 1899, was a Cragmor area mine. The plat for the town was filed on May 13, 1901 in which Pape divided up the land for the town into 180 lots. The town‚Äîbounded by the present El Paso Street, Templeton Gap Road, and Fillmore Street‚Äîhad a steel company, power plant, farms, and a large greenhouse. Its street names were after states, like Virginia and Pennsylvania. Plans for a new two-room schoolhouse were made in 1908. A social program was implemented about 1919 by Professor A. P. R. Drucker and his students from Colorado College for immigrants to teach English, civics, history, and math. Wrestling and boxing classes were also taught as part of the program. Nick Venetucci worked on the family farm in Papeton, where his Italian-born father was a coal-miner. Nick's brother died in an explosion on the farm. In 1942, 200 people lived in the town. Templeton Gap Flood On May 27, 1922, a cloudburst flood, the most severe since 1880, occurred along Templeton Gap, a semi-circular basin surrounded by hills, and through Papeton. Papeton's streets were covered by up to of water. Barns, fences, and streets were washed out. Subsequently, there were water development construction projects by the federal government to protect Colorado Springs and Papeton from floods. Airstrip An airstrip was built on 320 acres owned by the Colorado Springs Company west of Papeton by Winfield E. Bowersox, who learned to fly and attained his pilot's license in 1913 from the Wright Aviation School. The airstrip was about four blocks from the end of the street car line. Papeton was adjacent to the Nichols Field in the 1950s. Venetian Village In 1954, the Venetian Village subdivision was established between Templeton Gap, Columbine and Hancock Roads with streets named for flowers, like Primrose and Larkspur. It was designed with two churches and a shopping center. The land was purchased from the Ventucci family, who had operated a farm for 33 years and had a house in Papeton. Property values increased 20.85% between 2016 and 2017, increasing from a median value of $130,645 to $158,730.

Companies that use fair trade certified cocoa to create products can advertise that they are contributing to social, economic, and environmental sustainability in agriculture.  Background  In the 1990s, exactly 1 percent of the world's cocoa was produced on small, family managed farms, primarily in West Africa and Latin America. Local collectors and intermediaries purchase and transport the cocoa to exporters and processors. Many farmers are unaware of the final destination and value of their cocoa. Low prices and increasing need for fertilizer often created labor shortage, leading to slave labor in many West African countries with cocoa production. Fair trade cocoa certification was created to overcome these problems. The first fair trade certification of a cocoa product was arranged by the Max Havelaar Foundation of the Netherlands in 1994. The product was Green & Black's Maya Gold Chocolate, which was made with cocoa from Belize. The Max Havelaar Foundation was also the first Fairtrade Certification Mark. The Dutch foundation has now incorporated itself into Fairtrade International (FLO), a nonprofit organization with 25 member countries that use fair trade certification labels. In 2002, Fair Trade USA, which at that time had been incorporated into Fair Trade International (FLO), started certifying fair trade cocoa products sold in the United States.Fair Trade USA In September 2011, Fair Trade USA split from Fair Trade International (FLO). In 2001, the issue of forced labour in cocoa production was brought to the public's attention by a series of articles published in the United States by Sudarsan Raghavan, Sumana Chaterjee, and the Knight Ridder news agency. They included interviews with victims of child trafficking for cocoa production. Noting that the United States has laws against importing goods produced using slave labor, Congressman Eliot Engel and Senator Tom Harkin proposed to enact a ‚Äúslave- free‚Äù label for chocolate. The United States cocoa industry lobbied against this, and the mandatory labeling proposal was reduced to a voluntary system. Under this system, known as the Harkin‚ÄìEngel Protocol, chocolate producers pledged that by July 1, 2005, they would use ‚Äústandards‚Ä¶consistent with applicable federal law, that ensure cocoa beans and their derivative products have been produced without the worst forms of child labor.‚Äù A major study of the issue in 2016, published in Fortune magazine in the U.S., concluded that approximately 2.1 million children in West Africa \\"still do the dangerous and physically taxing work of harvesting cocoa\\". The report was doubtful as to whether the situation can be improved. \\"According to the 2015 edition of the Cocoa Barometer, a biennial report examining the economics of cocoa that‚Äôs published by a consortium of nonprofits, the average farmer in Ghana in the 2013‚Äì14 growing season made just 84¬¢ per day, and farmers in Ivory Coast a mere 50¬¢. That puts them well below the World Bank‚Äôs new $1.90 per day standard for extreme poverty, even if you factor in the 13% rise in the price of cocoa last year. And in that context the challenge of eradicating child labor feels immense, and the chocolate companies‚Äô newfound commitment to expanding the investments in cocoa communities not quite sufficient. ... 'Best-case scenario, we‚Äôre only doing 10% of what's needed.' Getting that other 90% won't be easy. 'It's such a colossal issue,' says Sona Ebai, who grew up farming cocoa in Cameroon and is the former secretary general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries. 'I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it's the proverbial all-hands-on- deck: government, civil society, the private sector.'He pauses, taking in his own thought for a moment. 'And there, you really need leadership.'\\"  Fair Trade Cocoa Criteria  Although the criteria for fair trade cocoa certification vary amongst different organizations, the following criteria are standard: 1) Fair Trade standards assist farmers to organize as cooperatives and associations so they can earn fair prices for their products. 2) Fair Trade certification organizations regularly inspect cocoa producers to ensure that they meet child labor standards. Fair Trade acts immediately when infractions are found to protect the children involved and secure their safety. 3) Fair Trade standards promote environmental sustainability in producing cocoa crops. They prohibit the use of dangerous agro-chemicals and GMOs. 4) The Fair Trade price guarantees that farmers are paid a sustainable price for their product. In cocoa cooperatives, buyers also contribute money to community development, allowing cocoa farmers to increase product quality, build infrastructure, train workers, bring safe drinking water to their communities and establish local health clinics and schools.  Fair Trade Cocoa Products in the United States  As of 2010, there were 62 cocoa-growing cooperatives in the US fair trade system. The producers supplying the U.S. fair trade cocoa are located in Bolivia, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Ghana, Panama and Peru. In 2010, the amount of fair trade certified cocoa and chocolate products in the United States increased drastically, with a 67 percent increase from 2009. However, this is a small percentage of the total market for cocoa products. Also, in the USA products which have as little as 11% fair trade-produced cocoa can be labelled as Fair Trade Chocolate. In some cases, if other ingredients besides cocoa are fair trade, the amount of fair trade cocoa may be less. In January 2010, Kit Kat converted its Kit Kat bar to use fair trade certified cocoa.  Economic Impact  = Additional Income for Farmers = Typically, the farmers who grow the cocoa beans only receive 3.2% of the price of the final cocoa bar.https://www.confectionerynews.com/Article/2014/07/10/Price-of-Chocolate- Breaking-poverty-cycle-in-cocoa- farming#:~:text=Cocoa%20farmers%20receive%20just%203,chocolate%20bar%2C%20according%20to%20Oxfam. In Ghana and the Ivory Coast, the two largest contributors of chocolate in the world, farmers will make as little $0.50 per day and the majority of their income is dependent on cocoa farming. In the past thirty years, cocoa prices have been as low as $714 per ton in 2000 to as high as $3,775 per ton in spring of 2011. Although the market price of cocoa fluctuates, fair trade certification has created a minimum price for which the cocoa farmers must be paid per ton. The farmers receive either the market price or the fair trade minimum, whichever is higher. In January 2011, Fairtrade International (FLO) created an international standard for the minimum price fair trade cocoa farmers receive per ton of cocoa. It was increased from $1600 to $2000 per metric ton of cocoa. The minimum price set by Fair Trade ensures a consistent minimum wage for farmers. This gives farmers financial stability and the ability to plan for future events. This consumption smoothing yields to a better quality of life for the farmers and their families. Additionally, the cocoa farmers average age is increasing, currently sitting at about 50 years old. Few young people want to stay in the industry as the wages are so poor they are looking elsewhere for work. By increasing their wages through Fair Trade practices, younger generations are encouraged to stay and the industry can continue to produce. Without increasing income, the chocolate supply will fall as the aging population is unable to produce at current levels. World Price of Cocoa in USD/kilogram from Feb 2013 to March 2017 Since 1998, Fair Trade USA has helped US-based companies using fair trade cocoa to generate more than $220 million in additional income for their cocoa cooperative farming communities. = Community Development = Since 2002, $1.25 million has been paid by Fair Trade USA certified cocoa companies directly to fair trade cocoa cooperatives for community development projects. These additional funds allow cocoa farming communities to attain programs that create better access to health care and education, support women, and protect the environment. Fair Trade USA's cocoa cooperatives are largely in West Africa and Latin America. = Increasing Equality for Women = While men are paid little while working on a cocoa farm, women are often paid less if at all. In the Ivory Coast, women constitute nearly 70% of the farm labor producing cocoa yet receive just over 20% of the income.https://reliefweb.int/report/world/economic-empowerment-african-women- through-equitable-participation-agricultural-value Women constitute only 25% of the landowners producing cacao in the Ivory Coast.https://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/follow-the-food/the-invisible-women- farmers-of-ivory-coast.html As a result, women are unable to get loans or a line of credit to increase the quality of their crops and the productivity of their trees through investments in equipment. Fair Trade cocoa ensures that all are paid equally regardless of gender. As a result, women are able to invest in their farms. This increases agricultural productivity and product quality. Women are also shown to have greater marginal returns than men when given higher income. Improving their income also has the effect of improving the lives of their children as well.  Political Impact  In C√¥te d'Ivoire, where much of the country's wealth and employment is based on cocoa production,Global Witness. 2007 Hot Chocolate: How cocoa fueled the conflict in Cote D‚ÄôIvoire. the government and the rebel group Forces Nouvelles (FN) are competing for fair trade cocoa producing land; revenues from the cocoa trade have contributed to funding armed conflict. After the 2010 presidential election, incumbent Laurent Gbagbo alleged corruption in the voting process and refused to cede power to Alassane Ouattara, the internationally recognized winner. Ouattara called for a ban on cocoa exports in order to cut off Gbagbo's main funding source. The European Union (EU) endorsed the ban and forbade ships from the EU to dock in C√¥te d'Ivoire. Cocoa farmers continued to harvest their cocoa beans, but the majority of beans were stored in warehouses and not exported. Some cocoa was smuggled through neighboring countries.  Environmental Impact  A life cycle analysis study of the environmental impact of cocoa production in Ghana, the world's second largest producer of cocoa, shows that the majority of cocoa production in Ghana is not environmentally sustainable,Ntiamoah, Augustine, with George Afrane. 2007 Environmental impacts of cocoa production and processing in Ghana: life cycle assessment approach. causing a variety of problems ranging from ozone layer depletion, water and soil contamination by pesticides. to atmospheric acidification and abiotic depletion. In order to obtain fair trade certification, cocoa producer companies are required to follow to fair trade environmental standards. On a case by case basis, they must assess the environmental impacts of a cocoa farmer's operations, develop plans designed to mitigate those impacts and monitor the implementation of those plans. Although the environmental standards for fair trade certification vary by organization, they all include sustainable irrigation practices, crop rotation, reducing carbon emissions, improving biodiversity, prohibiting GMO crops, safe use of only legal pesticides and proper hazardous waste disposal. In addition to the environmental impacts cocoa farming has on the earth, the pesticides used by conventional cocoa farming are some of the most harmful pesticides used in agriculture. Lindane is one of the primary pesticides used on cocoa farms. The Environmental Protection Agency has released a study on lindane stating the acute effects caused by inhalation cause irritation to the respiratory track as well as seizures and vomiting. As the workers live in poverty, often pesticide and herbicide treatment on the cocoa plants are done without proper or any protective gear. Without proper gear, the farmers have prolonged, direct exposure to the chemicals leading to long term health issues for the farmers. By increasing income, farmers can buy and use proper protective gear in order to mitigate these symptoms. Many Fair Trade certifiers also encourage environmental sustainability and transition to organic farming while demanding safe working conditions for farmers.  Company Responses to the Fair Trade Cocoa Movement  The global chocolate industry was worth about $98 billion by the end of 2016. In 2015, the United States alone had a market size of $22 billion and 81% of Americans were consuming chocolate. This adds up to America producing about 1/5 of the world's demand for chocolate and the potential to have a major impact on the lives of cocoa farmers around the world. Founded in 2006, Theo Chocolate was the first bean-to-bar, Fair Trade and organic certified company in the United States. Since then, Dandelion Chocolate, Askinose Chocolate, Chuao Chocolatier, Droga Chocolates, and many more. = Hershey = Advocates of Fair Trade Cocoa had been urging Hershey, a large chocolate manufacturer with more than 40% of the United States market, to shift into fair trade cocoa productionNewman, Tim, with Elizabeth O‚ÄôConnel. 2010 Time to Raise the Bar: The Real Corporate Social Responsibility for the Hershey Company. by creating fair trade cooperatives with their cocoa producers in West Africa. As of 2012, these efforts have met with little success. = Ben & Jerry's = American ice cream manufacturer Ben & Jerry's committed to use fair trade certified cocoa in all its ice creams by 2013. = Endangered Species Chocolate = Endangered Species Chocolate, a chocolate manufacturer in Indiana, had been fair trade certified up until 2006.Knowmore.org However, in February 2006, Endangered Species Chocolate removed its fair trade certification and instead guaranteed it would dedicate the money previously used for the fair trade certification to directly support the farmers in the Conacado Co-op, where the company continues to source its cocoa. Endangered Species Chocolate continues to guarantee that its cocoa farmers in the Conacado Co-op are receiving a fair wage. One caveat to this approach is the accountability to Fair Trade practices. Companies pay money to certifying organizations to receive certification, and this money is not going to the cocoa farmers. On the other hand, a company that says that it is following fair trade practices but lacks a fair trade certification may not actually be following fair trade practices. This could lead to a moral hazard of saying the company is implementing Fair Trade practices, charging premium prices, but in actuality, not paying higher wages to farmers. = Cadbury = Cadbury announced that it would make Cadbury Dairy Milk fair trade in the UK in 2009. This was then rolled-out across Cadbury‚Äôs international operations in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Canada, India and South Africa. Cadbury also adopted the Fairtrade certification mark across its chocolate bar branding. In 2017, Cadbury withdrew from its fairtrade scheme under the Fairtrade mark and instead, with its parent company Mondelez, launched its own Cocoa Life programme. Cocoa Life is a USD$400 million programme, which plans to reach 200,000 fair trade cocoa farmers by 2022. The abandonment of the fairtrade foundation certification by Cadbury was initially panned by critics, who thought the change could confuse customers. However, it was clarified by both Cadbury and the Fairtrade Foundation that their relationship was still ongoing.  Child Labor  Due to low wages in conventional chocolate growing, many farmers are unable to hire additional labor to maintain the cacao trees and instead use child labor to fill the gap. In 2009, there were over 109,000 children in the Ivory Coast engaged in child labor. This contributes to children not attending school. UNICEF found that from 2008-2012 there was an average of 67% enrollment for male and 55% enrollment for females in primary school. With Fair Trade practices, child labor is prohibited and farmers are paid a fair wage for their work. This allows more children to attend school and gain an education. Gaining an education is a step towards breaking the cycle of poverty. Carol Off, author of Bitter Chocolate: Investigating The Dark Side of the World‚Äôs Most Seductive Sweet, argues that the only solution to the issue of abusive child labor practices in cocoa production is to pay farmers a price at which they can employ adult workers.Off, Carol. The Dark Side of Chocolate. Off asserts that in order to receive this price, farmers must organize themselves with the help of local government departments, and be given access to accurate information about the world cocoa market price, through the Internet, so that they can bargain efficiently by themselves. Global Exchange, an international human rights organization, agrees that fair trade cocoa is a means of ending the use of child labor in cocoa production.Global Exchange. 2005 The News on Chocolate is Bittersweet: No Progress on Child Labor, but Fair Trade Chocolate is on the Rise. In 2001, the US cocoa industry set a goal to end abusive and forced child labor on cocoa farms by 2005 and outlined the basic steps the industry would have to take to achieve this goal. By 2012, the goal had not been met. Global Exchange has concluded that the industry will adopt fair trade certification when consumers demonstrate preference for fair trade cocoa through their chocolate purchasing choices. = 2015-2018 update = A study of the child labor (in cocoa fields) issue, published in Fortune magazine in the U.S. in March 2016, concluded that approximately 2.1 million children in West Africa \\"still do the dangerous and physically taxing work of harvesting cocoa\\".

He was born at Mulen in Naustdal as a son of farmers, but moved to Bergen and took shoemaker's training from 1898 to 1901. He joined the trade union in 1903. He worked as a shoemaker until 1918, then as a secretary in the local trade union information office. From 1920 to his death he was an office clerk in the people's register of Bergen. He chaired Bergen Labour Party from 1911 to 1913. He was a member of Bergen city council from 1910 to 1919, 1922 to 1925 and 1928 to 1937. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from the constituency Kalfaret in 1912 and Nygaard in 1915. In 1921 he joined the new Social Democratic Labour Party, and headed their ballot in Bergen in the 1921 and 1924 election. He was not elected. In 1927, however, he rejoined the Labour Party as the two parties merged, and was elected to Parliament in 1927, 1930, 1933 and 1936. He was a member of the Luxury Tax Commission of 1917, Labourer Commission of 1918 and the Wage Commission of 1919. He was a board member of Bergens Lysverker from 1919 to 1932, supervisory council of Bergens Privatbank from 1932 and a deputy auditor in the Office of the Auditor General of Norway.

It was founded in London in 1979 by Neal Jackson and Arthur Khoubesserian. Jackson chose the name 'Pink Triangle' after the symbol used to identify homosexuals in Nazi concentration camps (both Jackson and Khoubesserian are gay). Initial manufacturing took place on an industrial estate in Maidstone Road, Sidcup, Kent, and later at Lomond Grove, Camberwell, London. The company closed in 2003. History =Phonograph turntables= Very few of the company's first product, referred to as the Pink Triangle Original turntable, were produced. This product and some of the later models included some then very innovative design features. It had an 'aerolam' (a very light and stiff aluminium honeycomb structure developed for and first used by the aircraft industry) sub-chassis that rigidly coupled the platter/bearing assembly with the tone-arm while being low in mass, for low storage of vibrational energy. The wooden plinth was topped with a 3 part mirror glass plate that covered an aluminium frame providing mounting points for the suspension and DC motor. The suspension was unusual in that the subchassis hung from three extension springs rather than sitting on compression springs; a more stable arrangement. A mains socket mounted transformer/rectifier provided 9V DC to the speed controller board, which used tachometer feedback from the DC motor to regulate its speed. A small brass pulley drove the platter assembly using a flat rubber belt wrapped around a recessed face machined into the underside of the one-piece acrylic platter, another unconventional material chosen for its vibration dissipation qualities. The thrust element of the bearing was formed by a tungsten carbide sphere mounted in the bearing spindle pressing against a synthetic ruby cup in top of the aluminium support sleeve for the platter. The bearing was positioned close to the centre of gravity of the platter with side load being carried by a lower PTFE sleeve against the bearing spindle. The next product, referred to as the PT1, is often mistakenly assumed to be their first product. The PT1 was an easier to manufacture version of the 'Original' having the glass top plate replaced by a black painted steel plate. Later versions of the PT1 moved the motor from its original 'one o'clock' position to 'seven o'clock', on the opposite side of the spindle to the tonearm to mounted it on the top plate. This turntable was in production from 1979 until 1985. The PT1 was superseded by the PT TOO, which was also available as a manufacturer upgrade to the PT1, and featured a synchronous AC motor with an external power supply. Their next product was denoted as the Little Pink Thing (LPT), and was designed as their entry-level turntable, based on design principles taken from the PT TOO. Another lower-cost version of the PT-TOO, called the Export, also with the power supply moved into the plinth was released in the late 1980s. The PT TOO was replaced by the PT Anniversary, with much higher build quality, and returned to a glass top plate and a DC motor mounted on a new composite subchassis, along with a new external power supply, some of which featured a rechargeable battery power source topped-up from the mains supply. A mains- powered Pink Triangle Anniversary turntable, finished in black ash, with a Helius Orion Mk.1 tonearm and Audio Technica AT32EII moving coil cartridge. The last Pink Triangle turntable produced was the Tarantella. A complete stylistic departure from the earlier models, its chassis was a triangle of clear acrylic, with three metal spikes supporting it. DC motor and tonearm were mounted on metal outriggers, and the belt drove the periphery of the acrylic platter. Pink Triangle turntables were highly praised by the audio press and sold in significant quantities. However, they were never as commercially successful as the similarly priced Linn Sondek LP12 they competed with. =Other products= In later years the company also manufactured amplifiers, digital-analogue converters, and Compact Disc transports, however they did not sell in sufficient numbers to offset their manufacturing and research expenses. Successors One of Pink Triangle's founders, Arthur Khoubesserian, founded The Funk Firm in 2005.The Funk Firm website It produces a range of turntables based on the Pink Triangle philosophy of lightweight, rigid structures with DC motors. A notable innovation common to most of the range is the symmetrical arrangement of motor pulley and two idler pulleys around the subplatter, which eliminates the unbalanced side-load of the belt tension on the platter. The Funk Firm modifications, ironically, became best known for their improvements to the Linn Sondek LP12, Pink Triangle's largest competitor.

During this period, Umberto Valenti had run afoul of his boss, Salvatore D'Aquila, and was one of twelve men (including Giuseppe Morello, Ignazio Lupo, Ciro Terranova and others) marked for death. Valenti fled to Sicily for a time. Upon his return to America in January 1922, Valenti attempted to make amends with D'Aquila by eliminating his chief rival, Vincenzo Terranova.David Critchley, The Origin of Organized Crime in America: The New York City Mafia, 1891-1931, New York: Routledge, 2008. pgs. 100, 155-57 Valenti vs. Masseria On May 7, 1922, the boss of the Morello/Terranova crime family, Terranova, was killed in a drive-by shooting near his E. 116th Street home. Valenti was believed to have been personally responsible. Mere hours later, Terranova's underboss Silva Tagliagamba was fatally wounded in Lower Manhattan by Valenti and gunmen working for him. The next day, Valenti and some of his men attacked the new boss of the rival Terranova family, Joe Masseria. Valenti found Masseria and his bodyguards on Grand Street \\"within a block of Police Headquarters\\". The New York Herald reported that \\"When the fight was ended, the gunmen had shot four men and two women, but had not harmed each other.\\" Masseria tossed his pistol away and was arrested while fleeing the scene.Critchley, pgs. 155-56 On August 9, 1922, Masseria walked out of his apartment at 80 2nd Avenue, and was rushed by two armed men who opened fire on him. Masseria ducked into a store at 82 2nd Avenue with the gunmen in pursuit. They shot out the front window and shot up the inside of the store. The gunmen fled across 2nd Avenue to a getaway car idling just around the corner on E. 5th Street. The car was a Hudson Cruiser. The gunmen jumped on the running boards as the car sped west on E. 5th Street towards the Bowery, guns blazing. The gunmen then plowed through a crowd and shot randomly at the blockade, wounding six men. Masseria survived the incident and was found by police in his upstairs bedroom shell-shocked. He was sitting on his bed dazed, with two bullet holes through his straw hat, which he was still wearing on his head. The incident gained Masseria new respect among gangsters as \\"the man who can dodge bullets\\" and his reputation began to rise as D'Aquila's began to wane. Murder Forty-eight hours later, on August 11, Umberto Valenti attended a meeting in a cafe at the corner of Second Avenue and E. 12th Street. Accounts differ as to who was there. Masseria's key ally Giuseppe Morello is often said to have been present. Apparently realizing his life was in danger, Valenti burst outside as the bullets began flying. An eight-year-old girl standing nearby was wounded. Valenti managed to make it on the running board of a passing taxi before collapsing mortally wounded. The Herald stated, \\"Valenti, said to be strong in his hatred of Masseria, was killed coldly and with as little compunction as one would swat a fly.\\" Gangland lore had long held that his killer was none other than Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano. Just after this incident, Giuseppe Masseria began being referred to as \\"Joe the Boss.\\"Critchley, pg. 156 References Further reading *David Critchley, The Origin of Organized Crime in America: The New York City Mafia, 1891-1931, New York: Routledge, 2008. .

Biography Alexander Turgenev was born in Simbirsk in 1784. His father, Ivan Petrovich Turgenev (1752-1807) was one of the most enlightened men of his time. Alexander was educated at Moscow University, where he met the poet Vasily Zhukovsky; they formed a friendship that lasted until the death of Turgenev. From 1802-1804 he studied history and political science at the University of G√∂ttingen, and then traveled with his friend Andrey Kaisarov. He served in the Ministry of Justice, took part in the work of the Commission to formulate laws, and accompanied the Tsar, Alexander I abroad in 1810. Afterwards he was appointed Director of the Department of the General Directorate of Religious Affairs of Foreign Faiths; at the same time he was made an assistant secretary of the State Council and a senior member of the committee drafting the law. When the Ministry of Religious Affairs and National Education was formed in 1817, Turgenev headed the Department of Religious Affairs. In 1824 Prince A. N. Golitsyn was dismissed from the post of Minister of Religious Affairs and National Education and the Ministry itself was transformed. The Department of Religious Affairs was made completely different, Turgenev was dismissed from his management position, and replaced by a member of the Commission to formulate laws. After this, he was often abroad, where he examined archives and libraries, collecting information on the ancient and modern history of Russia. The materials thus collected were made available to the Archaeological Commission by order of Tsar Nicholas I, and published in 1841 and 1842 under the Latin title . The first volume was an extract from the Vatican archives of the 11th century, while the second volume included statements of the Pope and the reports of papal representatives of Russia from 1584 to 1718, historical facts regarding Russia extracted from archives and libraries in England and France from 1557 to 1671, and facts collected by –ê. B. Albertrandi for the Polish historian A. S. Narushevich. In addition, Turgenev made extracts, mostly from the Paris archives, concerning the era of Peter the Great. Turgenev was close to many representatives of science and literature, both Russian and foreign, and Ivan Dmitriev, and Prince Pyotr Vyazemsky were his friends. Turgenev played a part in the works and the lives of Konstantin Batyushkov, Alexander Pushkin, Ivan Kozlov, and Yevgeny Baratynsky. It was Turgenev that took the body of Pushkin from Saint Petersburg to the family vault at the Svyatogorsk Monastery. All his life he never stopped learning, and his letters were, according to I. N. Sreznevsky, \\"one of the treasures of our literature, with the diversity and richness of the historical information, vivid and true, and all the thoughts and feelings expressed in them.\\" References Sources * Category:1784 births Category:1845 deaths Category:Russian historians Category:Russian politicians Category:Russian people of Tatar descent Category:People from Ulyanovsk ","title":"Alexander Turgenev"},{"id":"35785723","text":"Ngando is a Bantu languages of the Central African Republic.

He later became a notable silversmith designing jewellery and lamps.J√∏rn Otto Hansen, \\"Mogens Ballin\\", Kunstindeks Danmark og Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon. Retrieved 10 May 2012. Biography Ballin came from a well-to-do Jewish family in Copenhagen. Of particular importance to his future were the French lessons he had with Paul Gauguin's wife, Mette, in Frederiksberg. Thanks to the works of Gauguin he saw in her apartment, he was able to follow the most important trends in French Impessionist art. In 1889, he went to Paris where he met Gauguin and his friends who together made up the Nabis group of artists. Landscape (c. 1892) At a celebration for Gauguin in March 1891, he met the Dutch painter Jan Verkade who had a marked influence on the development of his career. The two young artists decided to go to Brittany together, staying at the Pension Gloanec in Pont-Aven. Later they joined Paul S√©rusier in Huelgoat where they came into contact with Georges Rasetti (1889-1957). They also went to Le Pouldu where they completed a number of Synthetist landscapes under S√©rusier's leadership. Together with Maxime Maufra and Charles Filiger, they hoped to embark on a new form of art. Though they were never able to achieve it, it was apparently an early attempt at abstract painting. In May 1892, Ballin went to Saint-Nolff with Verkade, producing a number of small landscapes and many drawings. Later that year, he travelled to Italy where became a Roman Catholic, being baptised in Fiesole near Florence in January 1893. He then returned to Copenhagen where he supported religious ideals, contributing to the periodical \\"Taarnet\\". Together with Verkade, he helped Johannes J√∏rgensen to achieve his breakthrough. In 1899, he opened a workshop for metalwork together with Siegfried Wagner, finding inspiration from Willumsen and contributing to the Danish version of Jugentstil, in particular working with tin and silver and producing lamps and jewellery. His efforts provided inspiration for Georg Jensen and Just Andersen (1884-1943).\\"Mogens Ballin\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 11 May 2012. Style of painting Although Ballin did not produce many paintings, his work clearly played a role in developing the trends of the Nabi artists with his use of pure colour, blue background tones, false perspective, and the high horizons in his landscapes. His portraits, influenced by Charles Filiger show his religious aspirations and latent mysticism. They have the appearance of modern Byzantine icons. In Paul S√©rusier's words, \\"Ballin has an approach which is strange and serious, rich and fanciful.\\"Claude Jeancolas, La Peinture des Nabis, Paris, FVW Edition, 2002.

At the age of ten he moved from Kyoto to Edo (Tokyo) to study massage and other therapeutic techniques under Ryomei Irie, one of the most famous medical practitioners of the era. His apprenticeship was short; Irie quickly dismissing him as \\"dull\\". On his way back to Kyoto, Sugiyama fasted and prayed for 100 days at the shrine of the goddess Benzaiten at Enoshima Cave, where he reputedly discovered the secret of the shinkan (\\"insertion tube\\") after pricking himself on a needle wrapped in a leaf. His development of the shinkan, combined with his use of extremely fine gold and silver needles, allowed for comparatively painless acupuncture, and resulted in considerable expansion of the art; for this reason he is often referred to as the \\"father of Japanese acupuncture\\". He started around forty-five schools teaching massage and acupuncture to other blind people, resulting in the prevalent association in Japan between blindness and physical therapy. After Sugiyama effected a cure for a neurotic disease afflicting sh≈çgun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi his work received official state endorsement, which greatly increased the popularity of his schools.

Early life Carlos de Anda Dominguez was born in 1908, during the Mexican Revolution. His family struggled as they were robbed by the government through corruption and dirty politics, but during a turbulent childhood and with the support of his mother, he found physical and mental refuge in sports. He became an accomplished platform diver by high school and became a member of the Mexico National team. He became a runner shortly thereafter, a sport that became his passion. Athletics career Carlos de Anda Dominguez participated in the Central American and Caribbean Games competitions in Havana, Cuba,Athletics at the 1930 Central American and Caribbean Games and San Salvador in 1935, where he set a record that lasted 28 years.Athletics at the 1935 Central American and Caribbean Games#Men's events Carlos de Anda Dominguez also set a Mexican national record of 48.1 seconds in the 400 dash in 1931, a record that remained unbroken for 32 years. He participated in the 1932 Summer Olympics, and qualified for the 1936 Summer Olympics, even though he retired from track and field in order to focus on work and family. As a Mexican representative, at the 10th Central American and Caribbean Games held in June 1966 in the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Carlos de Anda Dominguez discussed the need to form a Central American and Caribbean Athletic Confederation and proposed organizing the first Central American and Caribbean Championships. The first Championships were held on the 5th and 6 May 1967, in Jalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. During the celebration of the V Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Canada, a tentative constitution was approved, a permanent committee elected, and the site of the second Central American and Caribbean Championships was awarded to Cali, Colombia, for August 1969, with Havanna, Cuba, as the alternate site. The Constitution was finally adopted on the occasion of the second Championships in August 1969. It has been revised and amended at General Assemblies in Guadalajara, Mexico, June 16, 1979; San Juan, Puerto Rico, July 5, 1979; Nassau, Bahamas, August 22, 1980; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, July 11, 1981; Maracaibo, Venezuela, August 18, 1998; Bridgetown, Barbados, June 27, 1999, San Juan, Puerto Rico, July 16, 2000, Bridgetown, Barbados, July 7, 2002 and San Salvador, El Salvador, December 4, 2002, Habana, Cuba, July 5, 2009, Santo Domingo 2010, Mayaguez 2010.

Carlos de Anda Dominguez was elected head of the Mexican delegation during the 1967 Panamerican Games in Winnipeg, Canada, as well as the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. Carlos de Anda Dominguez was a member of the Mexican Olympic Committee from 1964 until his death in 1995. He was recognized by the Mexican Federation of Athletics in 1982, when his name was entered into the Hall of Fame of CODEME (Mexican Sports Confederation). This recognition and award is given to select athletes whose sporting excellence is example of perseverance, dedication and discipline. Professional life Beyond his accomplishments in athletics, Carlos de Anda Dominguez had an admirable work career. At a young age he took an interest in mathematics and studied accounting. Wanting to have a university degree in math (a degree that didn‚Äôt exist in Mexico at that time), he formed the Mexican Mathematics Foundation and became one of the first seven people in the country to earn a degree in Mathematics. Still in love with numbers, later in life he became General Director of La Nacional Compa√±√≠a de Seguros, S.A, and in 1951 he started his own insurance company, Seguros La Colonial in the city of Chihuahua, which in 1959 by the President of Mexico, Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos became La Aseguradora Hidalgo, S.A., one of the largest insurance companies in the country, and the only government owned insurance company in M√©xico. When he retired, he dedicated his time to write about his great grandmother, Josefa Ortiz de Dom√≠nguez, an influential woman in Mexico's history who was married to a powerful governor of the state of Quer√©taro. She, along with most of the leaders of the Mexican Revolution collaborated in the planning and execution of the Mexican Independence movement, which resulted in Mexico‚Äôs independence from Spain on September 16, 1810. Her name is in the books as one of the most influential female politicians in the history of the country.

The story features the Battle of the Little Big Horn. It was filmed in Technicolor and released by Warner Bros.. Plot A rivalry between U.S. cavalry captains results in Kern Shafter being demoted and disgraced for striking Edward Garnett with a saber. Kern claimed to be defending the honor of his fianc√©e. Kern drifts for a while and is attracted to Josephine Russell, a woman he meets as they are both waiting to board a stagecoach to Fargo. When they reach Bismarck in the Dakota territory, Kern heads to Fort Abraham Lincoln and enlists in the 7th Cavalry. He is assigned to a company headed by an old friend and former sergeant major, Capt. Myles Moylan, and assigned the rank of sergeant. He is pleased until he learns that Capt. Garnett is there at Fort Lincoln as well; he is the commander of a different company, but is referred to as \\"top dog\\" by Moylan. Kern makes a friend named Donovan, a private. Donovan was formerly a sergeant until he punched a sergeant major. The two of them are assigned to investigate the murder of local miners by Sioux tribesmen, leading to a dangerous encounter. When these risky missions continue, Capt. Moylan begins to realize that Garnett is deliberately putting Kern at risk. Moylan puts into motion an effort to clear Shafter. The feud escalates when Shafter discovers that Garnett also has romantic designs on Josephine. Unaware of the history between the two men, or of Garnett's true character, she feels that Kern should be dealing with issues more reasonably; she is angered when Kern strikes Garnett. The soldiers leave with General George Armstrong Custer to engage the Sioux. Garnett deliberately puts Kern, Donovan, and another soldier in danger by sending the three on a scouting mission, claiming there are no Sioux warriors in the vicinity. The three see their company fall back as they discover a large Sioux war party in their scouting area. After his friend Donovan is fatally wounded, Kern is able to get back to his command, only to witness Custer and his own command killed in battle. Garnett pursues Kern during a different skirmish with the Sioux, and the two scuffle until Kern is knocked out by Garnett. When Garnett is about to drop a large rock on Kern, a Sioux warrior fatally shoots Garnett. Capt. Moylan arrives and kills the warrior, and informs Kern he saw the end of the fight with Garnett. The two then regroup with their command to fight the Sioux. Kern is shot during this battle. Kern and Moylan survive. Thanks to Moylan, Kern's reputation and rank of captain are restored and Josephine now sees Kern as the man she wants. Cast *Ray Milland ... Kern Shafter *Helena Carter ...

Smith Production =Development= The film was based on a novel by Ernest Haycox which was published in 1944 and was serialised in The Saturday Evening Post. The New York Times called it \\"competent\\". In May 1944 William Cagney purchased the screen rights intending to make it a vehicle for his brother James Cagney. It would be the first of six films William Cagney would make for United Artists. The others would be Blood on the Sun, Only the Valiant, Port Royal, The Stray Lamb and an untitled mystery romance. In August 1944 Ring Lardner Jnr was assigned to write the script, which. was intended to star James Cagney. The movie was meant to follow Blood on the Sun but was put back when Cagney elected to make The Time of Your Life instead. By March 1949 the Cagney deal with United Artists had ended and William Cagney signed a three-picture deal with Warner Bros; the films were to be Only the Valiant, A Lion in the Streets and Bugles in the Afternoon. In September 1950 William Cagney announced Harry Brown was writing the script. In February 1951 Warners announced that Harry Brown and Geoffrey Home had written the script and that filming would start in May. They hoped for Errol Flynn to play the lead. In April Roy Rowland, who had signed a long-term deal with Cagney Productions, was going to direct; he left for Utah to scout locations and Cagney were still hopeful Flynn would star. In April William Cagney announced he had signed Ray Milland to star and that Helena Carter, David Brian and Robert Preston would co star. (Carter had previously made Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye with Cagney.) Ward Bond was also mentioned. Then by May Brian ‚Äì who had refused to make the film and was put on suspension ‚Äì was replaced by Hugh Marlowe borrowed from 20th Century Fox and Bond ‚Äì who had to go make The Quiet Man was replaced by James Millican. By June Forrest Tucker joined the cast, presumably in the role intended for Preston. =Filming= Filming took place in June 1951. Parts of the film were shot in Johnson Canyon, Long Canyon, Asay Creek, Kanab Canyon, Aspen Mirror Lake, and Strawberry Valley in Utah. In late June, the unit returned from Utah.

B. A Thesis (University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria). 2011http://www.thenationlineng.net/2011/index The holy (sacred) day is known as Edigbe, meaning the day of joy.Studies in Urhobo Culture By Peter Palmer Ekeh pp.346-7 It is a religion based on dance, as its medium of worship to God. It began as a Urhobo-Kokori traditional sect, and in the 20th century was influenced by an influx of Christian evangelism.Success Akpojotor, pp.44-5 Originating in Kokori, it gradually spread in Urhobo nation and austral Nigeria at large.Success Akpojotor, pp.46-7 Beliefs The adherents of the Igbe religion are monotheists who believe in an omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent God called Oghene and that he rewards the good and evil alike, according to their deeds.Success Akpojotor, p.44 Dance is a core element of the Igbe. The adherents believe that by dancing, they draw on themselves the very hand of the one and only monotheistic God. Worship As dancing is a core element of the Igbe, there is no worship session without dancing. They sing native Urhobo songs in place of hymns. At worship services, the Igbe priest(s), always dressed in a white dress and white headgears, administer(s) native chalk on the worshippers for their protection.Sunday Odje, Kokori People, Ancient and Modern, Benin: Assembly Printers, 1995. Fellow Igbe worshippers dress in white attires too, with their neck powered in white and them carrying basins and small stools. When the native drums beat, they sway left and right in a dance, as though possessed by a deity. The Igbe religion celebrates an annual feast, Ore Isi, for twelve days. It takes place every May, with thousands are in attendance.S. Odje, p115http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index History Igbe was founded in 1858, in Kokori Nigeria. Ubiecha Etarakpo allegedly saw an apparition of two divine beings who \\"anointed\\" him to preach against immorality and witchcraft. After the alleged apparition, Ubiecha became eccentric and acted insanely as no day passed without him dancing. This scared the people from coming close. It was also alleged that after the alleged apparition, Ubiecha performed amazing miracles, accurately predicted the future, healed the sick and miraculously identified witches. He built a worship house called 'ogua' in his compound and, from there, ministered to the people with native white chalk; and, allegedly prophesied with stunning accuracy. This brought people from across the Urhobo country to Kokori.Success Akpojotor, pp. 44-5Sunday Odje, pp.113-14http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index Ubiecha died in 1920, after gaining fame and wealthSunday Odje, p.115http://www.nationonlineng.net/2011/index Divisions After Ubiecha's death and burial. His children became divided over succession. By tradition, his eldest son, Ibodje Ubiecha succeeded his father as chief priest and head prophet; but his half brother, Akpokovo Ubiecha, established his own branch in Kokori. One of Ibodje's daughters, Mary Ibodje, a priestess, also broke away to establish her own branch before Ibodje death in 1986. Jackson Ibodje, his eldest son, succeeded him.Sunday Odje, p.115 Syncretism With the influx of Christianity into Kokori in the 20th century, the Igbe was influenced by the presence and works of the Christian Church's evangelism. Another Igbe organisation was founded by Chief Ogbevire Ogogo. This Igbe sect was infused with some elements of Christianity. They observed Christmas and New Year holidays coupled with the Igbe core festival. It gained recognition and spread in Delta, Edo, Ondo, Rivers and Lagos states of Nigeria.Sunday Odje, p.117 Demographics Though the Igbe extends beyond Urhobo land, the bulk of adherents remain Urhobo people and the principal medium of communication is largely the Urhobo language.http://www.thenationlineng.net/2011/index Criticism Igbe has been criticized for rejecting conventional medical treatment. Igbe adherents believe and administer the native chalk for treatment of ailments. This has been viewed as dangerous.http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index There have been objections to the principal utilization of Urhobo language at worship sessions,http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index and it has been criticized as a religion of idol worship.http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index References Category:Traditional African religions ","title":"Igbe religion"},{"id":"35786423","text":"Silvino Vidal (Albergaria-a-Velha, Portugal, March 21, 1850-Pelotas, Brazil, August 9, 1937) was a Portuguese-Brazilian writer.

He is considered a true representative of poets of his generation having certain creative traits in an age when his nation and countries in the neighbourhood witnessed dramatic transitions particularly in the arena of politics. He won Bangla Academy Literary Award (2013). Early life, education and career On completion of his schooling and college studies at his hometown in northern Netrokona, Hafiz got himself enrolled at the University of Dhaka, at a time when it appeared as main centre of the brewing nationalist movement which eventually saw the 1971 emergence of independent Bangladesh. He is considered a true representative of the poets of his generation. He studied at Netrokona Datta High School, Netrokona College and University of Dhaka. Hafiz earned the repute of being an established poet of verve, vigour and emptiness long ahead of the publication of his first collection of poems: Je Jale Agun Jwale (The water where fire is ignited) in 1986. It earned the best sellers status in Ekushey Book Fair of the year, discarding novels by popular writers who traditionally occupy the position in Bangladesh's biggest annual book fair. \\"Nishiddha Sampadakiya\\" (The Banned Editorial), one of his most quoted poems inspired at least two generations since the pre-independence nationalist upsurge of 1969 and pro-democracy campaigns in post independence periods. Poetry Hafiz never associated himself directly with any political activity but his famous verses ‚ÄúEkhon joubon jar juddhe jabar tar shreshtha samoy‚Äù (It's the best time for one to go to war who is in his youth) was seen in wall writings, posters, leaflets and chanted in processions at university campuses and street side walls to inspire the youths to get prepared for the Liberation War against Pakistan. It returned as a popular slogan of student activists and left-leaning organisations during popular movements against military or autocratic rules in independent Bangladesh. But Hafiz, who appeared to be a sensitive man on questions of quality, visibly preferred a self-exile from the literary arena for years after the publication of the Je Jale Agun Jwale. He explained his silence as the outcome of a sense of fright of losing popularity after the tremendous success that reached him to the peak of fame. Hafiz, however, gradually resumed his literary activities recently coming up with his Kabita Ekattur (Poems Seventy One) recently to make visible again his formidable presence in the literary arena while his third book is set to hit the bookstalls in few months. A journalist by profession Hafiz eventually found the literature section of newspapers as his professional abode while he served as a literary editor of a number of newspapers over the past four decades. But the instability in the newspaper industry also threw him out of the job several times, exposing him to extreme difficulties. His luck in gambling earned him the repute of being a great gambler in close circle and in one of his newspaper interviews Hafiz bluntly said during his state of joblessness, gambling appeared to be his major income source for a period. A dichotomy of love of land and devotion to the lover is clearly visible in his poems but Hafiz finds a way toward a compromise projecting himself as a tender lover and rebel patriot as he wrote ‚ÄúRather today let us like the songs of Jahidur/Summon boshekh from the heart, bring in both lives /Do you know, Helen.

Discovering a sick woman with a baby, Roxy volunteers to spend the night. She comes up with an idea after the mother dies, stealing her identity and heading to San Francisco to find the woman's wealthy relatives, hoping to bring the baby back and receive an award.

Roxy plays a pair of suitors against each other until Frank suddenly returns to complicate her ambitions and to demand the money she stole.

Yvonne de Carlo agreed to make it under a new contract she had signed with Universal to make one film a year. Rock Hudson was cast opposite her and received his first star billing for the role. Filming began in November 1951. Reception The New York Times said \\"as a fetching Technicolor showcase for a lady who decidedly rates framing\\" the film \\"has its points. For some time Yvonne De Carlo has been flouncing through a series of routine costume adventures as a tough but good-natured minx from across the tracks who wades into society and inevitably backtracks with a bloke of her own caliber.

Werker and starring George Murphy, Finlay Currie, and Virginia Gilmore. It was released by Columbia Pictures. The screenplay was inspired by a May 1951 Reader's Digest article by J. Edgar Hoover entitled \\"The Crime of the Century: The Case of the A-Bomb Spies.\\" The article covers the meeting of German physicist and atomic spy Klaus Fuchs and American chemist Harry Gold as well as details of the Soviet espionage network in the United States. Gold's testimony would later lead to the case against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for treason. The film substitutes real atomic spying with vague top secret scientific programs. Extensive location shooting was done in New England, around Washington Union Station and in FBI laboratories. Plot summary Federal agent Belden (George Murphy) is assigned to locate the communist mastermind behind the leak, and to trace all avenues of informational access utilized by the Communists. Professor Albert Kafer (Finlay Currie) is the space-weapons scientist who is being blackmailed by the Reds into cooperating with them, while Alexi Laschenkov (Karel Stepanek) is the top Eastern-Bloc spy.http://www.allmovie.com/movie/walk-east-on-beacon-v115843 Using state of the art technology, such as an early miniature video camera, and ingenious methods like a roomful of foreign language lip readers, the G-men crack the case and with the help of the US Coast Guard rescue the professor before he can be spirited away by submarine.

Gameplay The game plays like any standard 2-d platform game in which the player can move the main character, Foxy McBox, through the level with the arrow keys and jump, but unlike in most games of its genre, the character cannot be controlled once in mid-air and will need forward momentum in order to jump in any direction, making it very difficult to make it through even some of the earliest stages. Besides, instead of following an argumental path, the players have the choice of taking on the levels in any order they want, something that can be used to the player's advantage by, for example, avoiding too difficult levels.The first complaints arrive! Deal with it. Development The developer decided to start creating the game after complaining across several game developer forums about the \\"extreme hand-holding of the player\\" in current generation games and as such he set out to create a game that would be brutally unfair to the player.Thread about easy games in Danish game developer forum Spiludvikling. By collecting some feedback on the Unreal Tournament 3 forums (on which he was an active participant as a modder) Jensen gathered what made players angry about a game and used it to create levels in HOW that abuse all of those things, but making sure that the player also sees it as a fault in his lack of skill rather than the game being impossible.Unreal Tournament 3 mods forum page In the official blog for HOW as well as on its Facebook page, Jensen claims that he wants to see players feel the frustration that was common in older games, First blog post on HOW's official website. and commented on his dislike of children thinking themselves to be tough for having beaten games that he considers too easy. Originally the characters had a very detailed look to them. Jensen posted on the Facebook page of the game several early sketches of the game's characters and game logo (originally \\"Tophatten\\", or Top Hat in English).Early sketches of the game. HOW's official Facebook page However, according to Jensen's Twitter account he gave up on the complex character design due to his lack of animation skills, sticking instead to an extremely blocky version of Foxy McBox, something that ended up adding to the difficulty of the game. Jensen finally released the game on April 29, 2012, with an update with several bug fixes and a few more levels coming two weeks later.Official blog post on the first update to the game. Reception Many players have reflected their frustration at the punishing difficulty of the game. One of the most repeated complaints is the fact that when the player dies he loses all progress in the game, no matter how many levels he has cleared. To this, Michael Jensen replied back in his blog that the game allows players to tackle each level in whatever order they want, and that players should use that to their advantage, finishing first those levels they are most likely to die in.\\"The first complaints arrive. Deal with it.\\", post on HOW's official blog Politiken journalist Thomas Vigild said that Jensen ‚Äúreally succeeds in conveying his message that games these days are too easy and he does it with aggression‚Äù.Journalist Thomas Vigild's blog post about HOW Several videos of users playing the game and showing their anger at it have been uploaded to YouTube since the game's release. Swedish indie developer Nicklas Nygren gave a speech during Nordic Game Indie Night in May 2012 where he called the game \\"the one he hates the most\\". His speech caused a surge of interest in the game but also started an enmity with Jensen.Michael Jensen tweets about his enmity with Nicklas Nygren Furthermore, when working as a game development teacher at Vallekilde Folk High School, Nicklas frequently uses HOW as an example of how not to design a video game.

Saran who earlier made her debut in Kannada cinema through Arasu opposite Puneeth Rajkumar in a cameo role immediately accepted the offer after reading the script.

The film was shot on location around Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, Arizona, and at the Montezuma Castle National Monument near Sedona. The local Yavapai Indians, who were employed as extras on the production, refused to enter the cliff dwellings because they represented the \\"dwelling place of the dead.\\" Consequently, production was delayed while a band of Navajos was brought in from a reservation 137 miles away to replace them.http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie;=53471 Plot A mysterious outlaw, known only as the Sidewinder (Victor Jory), is terrorizing Arizona settlers. A rancher whose property was raided, Tex McCloud (Hayden), and a U.S. Cavalry officer named Blaine (Forrest Tucker) both decide to seek justice. They even make a friendly wager over which one will get to the Sidewinder first. A wealthy saloon entertainer, Carolina (Arleen Whelan), tries to persuade Tex to also go after Lucky Lee, a mine owner who owes her $20,000. She also tries to seduce Tex, but he is not interested. After he changes hotel rooms with Lucky's longtime sweetheart, Nora Logan (Barbara Rush), an ambush is attempted by gambler Showdown Calhoun (Richard Arlen) and his partner, who come to the wrong room. Nora is the one they are after, and she becomes a kidnap victim on the stagecoach. For the second time, though, Tex rides to her rescue. Nora explains that she is involved with Lucky only out of gratitude for one saving her from a similar assault. Lucky offers a theory that Tombstone Jack is the notorious Sidewinder, but after Carolina sneaks up on Tombstone and kills him, Tex and Blaine begin to suspect that Lucky is the man they are after. Turquoise (Carol Thurston), a Ute woman who loves Lucky, knows for a fact he is the outlaw. Now the marshal for the territory, Tex and a posse go after Lucky, who has snatched Nora and ridden off to a hideout. Lucky conspires with a band of Utes to attack the posse. Carolina and Showdown are killed. Tex and Blaine get to the hideout, but the jealous Turquoise has already killed Lucky, beating them to the punch. The men call off their wager.

Plot The film is set at an undetermined date but presumably is intended to be in the later 19th century. Costumes vary from 18th century to 1950s. The ship is typical of the early 18th century but with a typical late 19th century name. The frequent discussion of \\"blackbirding\\" (apparently an old term for transporting slaves) would place the timeframe pre-1845. Captain Raikes of the ship \\"The Southern Cross\\" arrives on an island in the South Pacific Ocean to capture slaves. He rows ashore with his first mate Brown and other crew members, unaware the island is inhabited by three white adventurers who have been stranded there: Hurricane Smith, Dan O'Hara and Brundage. Smith, O'Hara and Brundage sneak on board \\"The Southern Cross\\", overwhelm the remaining crew, and takes over the boat. He sails it to Australia. On the way Smith explains he has buried half a million dollars in Dakaru before being unfairly arrested for piracy. He persuades O'Hara and Brundage to become his partners in retrieving it. In Australia, the three men rename their ship \\"The Lady Betty\\" try to raise money to track down the treasure. They are approached by Eric Gorvahlsen, a scientist who wants to hire a ship. Raikes and Brown arrive in Australia so Hurricane, Dan and Brundage take them prisoner on \\"The Lady Betty\\". Gorvahlsen goes on board the ship with his companions, Dr. Whitmore and Whitmore's half- Polynesian daughter Luana, who is also Gorvahlsen's lover. Gorvahlsen is actually planning to capture Hurricane's treasure on Dakaru. He has never seen Hurricane Smith and suspects that Dan O'Hara is he (the real Hurricane pretends to be \\"Jim Tyler\\"). Gorvahlsen tells Luana to find out information about Dan/O'Hara from Hurricane/Tyler. Luana and the real Hurricane fall in love with each other and she admits to having doubts about the scheme. Raikes and Brown have been released from the brig. They start a knife fight with Brundage and another sailor Clobb, which results in Raikes being sent back to the brig. Luana falls in the water and Hurricane rescues her from a shark. During this, Brundage accidentally calls Hurricane by his real name and Gorvahlsen notices. He orders Luana to drug Hurricane with gin but she warns him instead. Hurricane swims to the island of Dakaru to prepare the natives for the attack. Gorvahlsen orders Dan to anchor the ship off Dakaru. Brown then persuades Gorvahlsen to join forces with him and order Dan to release Raikes. Dan then leaves for the island to warn Hurricane. Hurricane sneaks back on board the boat by which time Brown has caused the crew to be unsettled. Hurricane is thrown in the brig and Clobb kills a sailor. Gorvahlsen takes over the ship, and Clobb encourages the rest of the crew to arm themselves. Gorvahlsen tells the crew about the gold and convinces them to help him claim it. In Dakaru, Hurricane is forced to lead Gorvahlsen, Brown and Raikes to where the gold has been buried. They dig up the treasure but then Dan leads the natives to attack. Dr. Whitmore spears Gorvahlsen to death and Brundage kills Clobb in a knife fight. Hurricane and Luana are united.

D.R. Fisher, 2009. On 9 November 1838 Phillips was elected Mayor of Newport, and became a figure of the Newport Rising. On 4 November 1839, he was in charge of the town when John Frost, at the head of 7,000 Chartists, entered it with the intention of releasing Henry Vincent from gaol. A 30-strong company of the 45th Regiment of Foot was placed at his disposal, and took up station in the Westgate Inn. When the hotel was attacked, Phillips was wounded with bullets in the arm and groin. The soldiers then fired on the crowd, which was completely routed, 22 being killed and about 50 wounded. Latterly Phillips was present at the arrest of John Frost and gave evidence at his subsequent trial in Monmouth. On 9 December Phillips was knighted to mark his \\"individual exertions in maintaining her majesty's authority\\". On 26 February 1840 he was voted the Freedom of the City of London, and admitted on 7 April. Phillips continued to warn about Chartist activity in south Wales in 1842.\\"Chartism and Industrial Unrest in South Wales in 1842\\", Walter T Morgan, National Library of Wales Journal, Vol X/1 (Summer 1957). Phillips was called to the bar at the Inner Temple on 10 June 1842. Shortly afterwards he set off on a tour of parts of Europe and the Middle East. He wanted to take a draughtsman, and on the recommendation of David Roberts employed Richard Dadd; Roberts knew Dadd's father.William Powell Frith, My Autobiography and Reminiscences vol. 2 (1888), p. 131; archive.org. The journey, via Venice, Greece and Egypt, saw Dadd suffer a breakdown, and he returned to England, leaving Phillips in Paris, in May 1843. Suffering from mental illness, Dadd subsequently stabbed his father to death, and was confined to Bethlem Hospital as insane. Phillips was named a Queen's Counsel on 17 February, and a bencher of his inn on 5 May 1865. His principal practice lay in parliamentary committees, and many lawsuits were referred to him for arbitration. In Monmouthshire he acquired coal-mines, and became a large landed proprietor in Wales. Phillips played a major part in the success of Brecon College. He was an active member of the governing bodies of King's College London, and the Church Institution, and president of the council of the Society of Arts. In 1848 he became a member of the National Society, and devoted time and labour to the work of national education. While living simply, he gave large sums to charities. At Court-y-bella, near Newport, he built and maintained schools for the education of the colliers. Death After addressing a committee of the House of Commons in 1867, Phillips was struck with paralysis and died five days later, on 26 May, at his London home, 77 Gloucester Place, Portman Square. He was buried in the churchyard of St Helen's church at Llanellen, Monmouthshire. He was unmarried, and his fortune was inherited by his sister's son, Thomas Phillips Price, who later became MP for North Monmouthshire between 1885 and 1895. Works Phillips was known also as a writer on Welsh education and Welsh language, and a champion of the Welsh church, particularly in Wales, the Language, Social Condition, Moral Character, and Religious Opinions of the People, considered in their relation to Education, with some account of the provision made for education in other parts of the kingdom (1849). This work defended the Welsh people and language against the 1847 \\"Blue Books\\" - official reports of a government commission's enquiry into the state of education in Wales. Authors Lingen, Symons and Johnson said the Welsh were dirty, lazy, ignorant, superstitious, deceitful, promiscuous and immoral, and advocated eradication of the Welsh language and the encouragement of the English language. Fluent in Welsh, Phillips exposed the lies of the \\"Blue Books\\", defended the Welsh people and their language, and proposed way to improve education in Wales; a biographer described his work: :\\"for lucidity of treatment, for fulness of information, for calm, judicial statement, for tender yet discriminating sympathy with his poor and neglected countrymen, no less than for the suggestion of remedies applicable to their case, very few publications of the kind can be compared to this one.\\" He was also the author of The Life of James Davies, a Village Schoolmaster (1850; 2nd edit. 1852), a biography of James Davies (1765‚Äì1849) of Devauden.

In the early 21st century coltan mining was associated with human rights violations such as child labour, systematic exploitation of the population by governments or militant groups, exposure to toxic chemicals and other hazards as a result of lax environmental protection, and general safety laws and regulations. A piece of Coltan Overview The coltan industry is worth tens of millions of dollars a year. The price for coltan ranged between $50 and $200 per pound in 2012Molinski 2012 and has spiked much higher in the past when supplies were scarce. In 2006, Australia, Brazil, and Canada produced 80% of the world's coltan.Melcher et. al 2008, p.1 As of 2018, coltan's main producers are Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nigeria, Brazil and China. Australia, Canada and Mozambique are also important players.USGS 2012, p. 163 Thus, the task of supplying world coltan needs has fallen largely on conflict regions and underdeveloped countries. The coltan market is characterized by opacity, as supply and trade is based on contracts that do not publish public price references. The products are sold in private, unregulated markets,Diaz-Struck and Poliszuk 2012 unlike commodity metals like gold, copper, zinc, and tin. No standards are set or enforced for mining operations and devising safety procedures is the responsibility of mine operators which may not prioritize worker well-being. The United Nations has taken an active role in assessing the state of the world's coltan industry and in 2003 has cited specifically the DRC as an example of a country where natural resource exploitation, \\"The flow of arms, exploitation and the continuation of the conflict are inextricably linked.\\" Ethical issues  =Human rights= Some notable similarities link mining practices in countries where they have come under fire: *systematic exploitation of workers. *while coltan miners are often well paid compared to others in their communities, they generally still do not earn a living wage by Western standards. *dangerous working conditions. The UN also considers developed countries that support conflict minerals violators of human rights for allowing the violations to continue rather than fulfilling and promoting the human rights set forth in the 1948 Declaration.Rauxloh 2007, p. 305  Working conditions  The UN has declared a right to choose one's employment and has also called safe working conditions a basic human right.UN 1948 However, the violence in the regions that produce conflict coltan gives the population little choice about whether to mine coltan. In Central Africa, for example, gold mines are typically connected to militias.  Forced and child labour  According to some activists, coltan mines in national reserves often forcibly use indigenous people for their operations. In Colombia - a very minor coltan producing country - the Puinawai natives call the coltan mines ‚Äúguns, pointed at the earth beneath [the] sacred mountain.\\"G√≥mez 2012 A report by the Commission of the European Union in 2011 raised issues of child labour in coltan mining in DRC, and in the recycling industry in Ghana and China. Twenty years ago it was reported that children as young as twelve were working in some mines.Nest 2001, p. 41 Amnesty International, in a joint investigation with African NGO African Resources Watch, in 2016 published a report that found that children even as young as seven years old are working in cobalt (not coltan) mines in the DRC. The report says that children were beaten and forced to pay \\"fines\\" to state officials as bribes for money extortion and intimidation. Furthermore, a lack of protective gear, and long working hours were lamented. Cobalt (element Co) mining is a totally different supply chain to coltan mining (elements Ta and Nb) and there is no geological overlap of resources or mines. =Mining and economic development= Many of the burgeoning coltan producers are resource-rich developing countries with economies that are currently largely dependent on mining non-renewable resources. This indicates a danger attached to even clean coltan operations in developing countries. Groups that study developing nations such as Oxfam caution against a developing country putting much of its capital into mining operations, especially single mineral developments. While countries like the United States, Canada, and Australia were able to turn their mining operations into profitable industries, these experiences are not practical models that would support today's developing countries‚Äô reliance on mining operations for further economic development.Power 2002, p. 28 These countries‚Äô dependence on mining creates tension due to the relatively small size of the developing countries and their exploitation of nonrenewable resources at the expense of their other natural resources.Willis and Murray 2011, p. 1 This land tension typically leads to poor economic performance and political instability, which in turn creates the conflicts that make coltan an ethically-charged commodity.Willis and Murray 2011, p. 2 =Environmental concerns= In addition to the human rights issues attached to the coltan industry, the mining process itself can be environmentally hazardous. Since it is usually pan-mined, the mining process and slurry from this process can contaminate water and may be harmful to ecosystems, although since no chemicals are added to process the minerals it is relatively benign. However, while the exact effects of prolonged coltan exposure through dust around particularly artisinal mines have not yet been studied in detail, more DNA damage was found in children living in mining areas than in those from control groups. Preliminary results of an ongoing study also hint that babies born to miners suffer \\"an increased risk of birth defects.\\" Other risks include acidic drainage and the presence of toxic metals such as nickel and substances like arsenic and cyanide. Air pollution is also a concern. Some people question the sustainability of artisinal mining, but miners often are very poor and have few other options to earn a living. Illegal mining in national parks and land reserves can be especially damaging, such as the Kahuzi-Bi√©ga National Park in the DRC and the Puinawai National Reserve in Colombia, due to the deep forest cover these places provide. Coltan is mined using techniques developed for gold mining in the 1800s.UN 2001 The work is difficult and dangerous, with workers panning for coltan in large craters in stream beds, with the average worker producing less than one kilogram of coltan a day. Coltan mines operate under boom-bust economics and not only strip the mineral from the land, but also cause environmental degradation. In mining towns that depend on coltan for their wealth, fewer people cultivate the land. Numerous instances of famine related to the mining operations contribute to increasingly unsustainable types for land use. Besides the harm it does to food security in the eastern Congo, coltan mining is inimical to land uses such as ecotourism, game ranches, and medical research which could possibly provide better incomes and profit from the wildlife and forest land. Mining threatens the national parks across the Congo.Montague, D. (2002). Stolen goods: coltan and conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. SAIS Review, 22(1), 103-118. Developing nations often go through with mining operations because they need the capital these operations bring without thinking of the environmental impacts. Given that mining is an expensive venture to undertake, the returns are sometimes low. Civil societies who study developing nations, such as Oxfam, have stated that the cost of mining on the environment can cause nearly permanent environmental damage,Power 2002, p. 33 which can leave a developing nation permanently poorer, and that support for mining should only be offered in countries that have a clearly defined plan for using the revenue gained from mining for the promotion of public health and infrastructure investments that will eventually allow them to become less resource-dependent.Power 2002, p. 34 The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the UN advocate for extractive activity to stop in UNESCO World Heritage sites and in proposed protected areas within conservation sites, in areas with last remaining examples of unique ecosystems, and in places where mining threatens the well-being of local communities and indigenous peoples. = Criminal activity =  Smuggling  Rwandan coltan comes mostly from mines in the DRC, usually in the conflict areas adjacent to the Rwandan border. Only four of the ten largest Rwandan mining companies have taken any measures to verify whether their product is conflict-sourced.Lublinski et al. 2010 Rwanda has been implicated multiple times in smuggling Congolese coltan by UN investigators, as have Burundi and Uganda.UN 2004 Uganda and Burundi however do not export coltan, so the UN has found it difficult to verify that the smuggling is still taking place. About half of exported Rwandan coltan comes from conflict regions in the DRC.Nest 2011, p. 26 Many countries export their raw coltan to China for further processing. The UN reports that many tons of coltan from the DRC are processed through China and are often mixed with samples from conflict-free regions to produce tainted coltan that is more difficult to source. This practice undermines the efforts made by countries with legislation restricting conflict materials, such as the United States and Canada.  Cartels  In Colombia, the coltan mining industry is involved in numerous internal conflicts and is currently illegal. This has not stopped guerilla forces and militia groups from mining the ore and selling it on the black market or shipping it to China. The Colombian government has made little attempt to regulate the industry. In 2010, plans were announced to auction off the rights to mine coltan in certain areas, but those plans were never completed and were dropped by the current administration. Most of the coltan activity takes place in the deep jungle areas along the Southeastern borders of Venezuela or Brazil, causing severe environmental repercussions. Colombia's coltan mines are often located in national parks and on indigenous territory, which forces the native population into the mining industry. Colombian coltan is tied to violence at every step of the process. The mines are typically owned by paramilitary groups or drug cartels such as the Sinaloa cartel and the Cifuentes Villa family, who use the same smugglers to move both drugs and coltan. Colombian authorities have little control over the coltan mining region due to its size and density, and coltan is easily moved along the same routes as cocaine and emeralds, two of Colombia's most heavily trafficked illegal goods.Nest 2011, p. 68 In Venezuela, the government has sent military patrols into the jungle to root out illegal mining activities and the Colombian cartel leaders who fund these operations. As in Colombia, indigenous Venezuelans in the Parguaza region have suffered from the mining industry, and people have suffered violence from the coltan mine's military supervisors.Parguaza range, green at top of image  Proposed solutions  =Ensuring clean coltan= It is difficult for manufacturers to ensure that the coltan they use in their products is not from a conflict zone or otherwise unethically produced. Currently there is one process for verifying the origin of a coltan sample. This process, developed in Germany, involves creating an elemental ‚Äòfingerprint‚Äô via WD X-ray fluorescence analysis and X-ray diffraction analysis to determine the composition and amounts of trace elements present in the sample.Melcher, et al. 2008, p. 8 These results are then compared to the results of samples of known provenance, much like the Kimberly process for diamonds. This technique works for samples of mixed sources as well as pure coltan; however, it requires having sample fingerprints for all original coltan sources on file. Using this technique, it is possible to identify the source of most coltan samples. As of 2010, almost 75% of the world's coltan mines have samples on file. However, the process is expensive and lengthy and while it has worked in Rwanda, adapting these fingerprinting techniques to the DRC mining industry and convincing countries such as China to adopt these methods has been difficult. Both the United States and Canada have passed legislation that provides incentives for using certified coltan and making conflict materials extralegal, but because most coltan is processed in China and China does not use the certification processes, avoiding conflict coltan has been very difficult. Roughly 60% of the coltan mines in Africa, including in the DRC, have some percentage of Canadian backing but are not subject to Canada's laws about environmental hazards and human rights violations.Missakabo 2008 Both Canada and the United States have passed acts that attempt to curtail the purchase of conflict- sourced materials.Marlow and El Akkad 2010b, p. 1 Most of this change has been consumer-driven. Back in 2004, the TIC had little interest in regulating conflict materials, but since then has become one of the leading voices promoting conflict-free minerals. Awareness campaigns in Western countries have been pushed manufacturers such as Apple and Intel to rely on more than just the word of their suppliers that the coltan used in their products is conflict-free.Marlow and El Akkad 2010a, p. 3 This consumer interest pushed the TIC to create a working group in 2009 to promote better standards for coltan mining and over the next decade it successfully removed conflict minerals from the coltan supply chain. The group works with the OECD, European Commission, civil society, the tin association, UN and with other NGOs to monitor risks associated with conflict affected and high risk (CAHRA) areas and to promote transparency in the supply chain.TIC 2012 The TIC has created a process to deliver conflict-free coltan from Africa to refinery sites, called ITSCI, by using independent third-party companies to assess the mining sites and determine whether or not they violate of human rights and through working with RMI to audit them smelters and refiners that purchase material.TIC 2011, p. 8 See also References Further reading *Diaz-Struck, Emilia and Joseph Poliszuk (2012) Venezuela emerges as new source of ‚Äòconflict minerals.‚Äô iWatch News (the Center for Public Integrity) 4 March 2012.

Founded in 1958, the school has a roll of 1479 students, including international students as of July 2018, making it the largest school in Whanganui. The school spelled its name Wanganui High School until May 2016, when it changed to \\"Whanganui\\".  History  In February 1958 a group of 148 Third Formers gathered for the first Assembly in the present D1. There was a staff of nine. By 1969 the roll had risen to 1100. The first Principal, Mr A.T. Gibson, emphasised 'manners, character, scholarship and human relations'. He stressed that the School was not an 'it' ‚Äì the 'family' life of the school was vital. These emphases have remained. The school developed a tradition of 'self-help' and through much fundraising has built up some very good facilities for the use of the students and staff. Facilities such as the Swimming Pool (1962), the Gymnasium (1968), the Centre Court, the extensions to the Cafeteria and Theatrette (1980's), the Shelters (1990's), The Department/Ministry of Education has added the Library (1970), The Music Block (1972), Te Atawhai (1996), Music and Drama renovations (1999), Staffroom ‚Äì Te Arahi (1999), Science Block and Deans' House ‚Äì Te Whare KaiƒÅrahi (2002), and new Gymnasium facilities (2006). In 2008 the school celebrated its 50th reunion.  School motto and life values  The school‚Äôs motto is 'That we might have life' and comes from the Book of John, in the New Testament (Chapter 10, Verse 10) ‚ÄúI am come that they might have life, and they might have it more abundantly\\". The school interprets this to mean that through academic, cultural, sporting and socialisation opportunities the school provides, each individual will have the opportunity to live life to the full. Stemming from this motto is Whanganui High School‚Äôs LIFE values. These are; Learning, Integrity, Fellowship, Excellence. These values form the bases of daily teaching and learning at Whanganui High School  Academics  Whanganui High School follows the New Zealand Curriculum (NZC). In Years 11 to 13, students work towards the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) the main secondary school qualification in New Zealand , and international qualifications such as Cambridge Assessment International Education in Mathematics.

Whanganui High School historically had a house system but it lapsed in 1972; eight Houses were introduced in 1982 just for swimming and athletics but this lapsed in 1989. During 2017 the community was consulted about possible House names and identities. The four House names chosen were Awa, Maunga, Moana and Whenua. Those names were gifted to the school, along with the iwi story of the origin of the Whanganui River at the Houses Opening Day. The houses of Whanganui High School are: * AWA * MOANA * WHENUA * MAUNGA The houses originate from a well-known whakataukƒ´ proverb E rere kau mai te awa nui, Mai i te kƒÅhui maunga ki Tangaroa, Ko au te awa, Ko te awa ko au. The river flows from the mountain to the sea. I am the river, the river is me. Demographics Fifty-three percent of students were male and forty-seven percent were female. Sixty-five percent of students identified as New Zealand European or PƒÅkehƒÅ. Twenty-seven percent as MƒÅori and eight percent as another ethnicity. Confucius Classroom In 2013 Whanganui High School was approved by the International Confucius Institute in Beijing to set up a Confucius Classroom ‚Äì one of only four secondary schools in New Zealand and only 400 worldwide. Confucius Institutes are non-profit public institutions aligned with China that aim to promote Chinese language and culture, support local Chinese teaching internationally and organise student cultural exchanges.

Mossman (April 30, 1867 ‚Äì September 5, 1956) was an American lawman and cattleman in the final years of the Old West. He is most remembered for his capture of the notorious border bandit Augustine Chacon in 1902, though he was also a successful businessman that owned the large Diamond A Ranch in New Mexico. Biography Burton C. Mossman was born on April 30, 1867, at farmhouse near Aurora, Illinois. In 1873, he and his family moved to Missouri and in 1882 they moved again, this time to New Mexico. Sometime after 1884, Mossman became a cowboy employed by the Hashknife Outfit, a large cattle company in northern Arizona Territory. Mossman was somewhat popular and respected. By the age of twenty he was the ranch foreman and in 1897 he was promoted to superintendent. During this time, Mossman was occupied with fighting cattle rustlers or pursuing private business ventures. Aside from ranching, Mossman and a partner operated a stagecoach line and in 1898 he was elected sheriff of Navajo County. That same year, Mossman and three of his associates built a brick opera house in Winslow, but he soon sold his share and built a store in Douglas, which was later sold as well, for $13,000. Mossman is said to have joined Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders in 1898 and fought in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, however, author Bill O'Neal makes no mention of this in his Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters and it seems Mossman was already very busy managing the Hashknife Outfit, serving as sheriff, and pursuing personal business interests. By 1901, banditry was widespread in Arizona so the territorial governor, Oakes Murphy, authorized the re-establishment of the Arizona Rangers. Because of his popularity, as well as past exploits, Mossman was appointed to be the first captain of the new unit. =Shootings= Mossman was involved in at least five shootings during his time as a rancher or a lawman. The first recorded in Bill O'Neal's Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters occurred in the summer of 1896. By this time, the Aztec Land & Cattle Company was in trouble so Mossman drove a herd of cattle south to Mazatlan, in Sinaloa, Mexico, to sell it. While in a Mazatlan cantina, Mossman quarrelled with a Mexican Army captain, who challenged him to a pistol duel. Mossman accepted and on the following morning the two men met, loaded their weapons with a single bullet, and then took fifteen steps away from each other. The captain was armed with a German Luger and Mossman had a short-barrelled Colt .45. When the two men turned around, both fired their weapons at the same time. The captain's shot missed, but Mossman managed to strike his opponent's shoulders. Mossman spent the next month in a Mexican jail, until he made his escape with the help of a friend. On March 17, 1898, after becoming sheriff of Navajo County, Mossman was out searching for a gang of cattle rustlers with Deputy Sheriff Joe Bargeman and a treacherous Mexican guide. In Walter Canyon, the posse found a cabin and a slaughtered cow, at which time the guide tried to make a run for it with his horse. Mossman chased the man down and knocked him off his horse with his Winchester rifle. Then, as he dismounted to help the guide to his feet, three other Mexican men opened fire on Mossman from 100 yards away. One bullet grazed Mossman's nose, one knocked off his saddle horn, and a final bullet cut his reins. Deputy Bareman had opened up by this time and, with covering fire, Mossman was able to take the guide prisoner and bring him to the cabin. The outlaws briefly laid siege to the cabin, but they soon retreated and the policemen made it to Holbrook, sixty miles away. Mossman was involved in another shooting that year. One fall night, Mossman was undressing in the second-floor room of a hotel in Springer, New Mexico when a bullet came up through the floor near his chair. Then, as he began rolling up his mattress for protection, a second shot came in. Angrily, Mossman armed himself with his rifle and began firing through the floor and into the bar below. According to O'Neal, the bar was vacated immediately and nobody was harmed. A bullet did, however, put a hole through the brim of a man's hat and a second one smashed a glass out of another man's hand. Mossman fought in two more skirmishes in 1901, after becoming the captain of the Arizona Rangers. The first occurred in Paradise Valley. Mossman was pursuing an outlaw named Salivaras and the trail led him to a water hole somewhere in the valley. As Mossman approached, Salivaras lay in ambush and grazed the captain in his right leg. Mossman immediately identified where the shot had come from so he then quickly pulled up his rifle, fired a single shot, and jumped off his horse. Sometime later, after working his way up to Salivaras' position, Mossman discovered that his bullet had taken off the top of the outlaw's head. Later that year, Mossman received information that six suspected train robbers were held up twenty miles south of the international border, along the Colorado River in Sonora. According to Bill O'Neal, Mossman and three of his men found the outlaws in an adobe house and then proceeded to destroy it with dynamite. After exploding four sticks, the outlaws attempted to shoot their way out, but the rangers shot five of them down with rifle fire. A sixth man escaped on horseback and none of the rangers were hurt. =Augustine Chacon= In 1902, Mossman turned his attention to apprehending the border bandit Augustine Chacon. To do this, Mossman came up with an idea that involved posing as an outlaw and recruiting the train robber Burt Alvord, who was a friend of Chacon, to use him as a stool pigeon. However, to recruit Alvord, Mossman had to find his hideout in Sonora, where he would be totally helpless against both the bandits and Mexican authorities. Mossman had previously attempted to capture Alvord and his gang, but they got away. This time, Mossman hoped that Alvord would be willing to help him with Chacon and then surrender in exchange for a lighter sentence and the reward money offered for Chacon's head. On April 22, 1902, after traveling for several days by wagon and on horseback, Mossman discovered Alvord's hideout, a small hut located some distance away from San Jose de Pima. The captain approached the hut unarmed and by chance he found Alvord standing alone outside while the rest of the gang were playing cards inside. Mossman was first to introduce himself and though Alvord was immediately alarmed about the presence of a police officer at his hideout, he agreed to feed Mossman and listen to what he had to say. When it was obvious that Mossman was not trying to fool Alvord, the two men agreed to cooperate and that Billy Stiles would act as their messenger for it would take a while for Alvord to find Chacon and convince him to cross the Arizona border and somebody had to warn the captain of when the bandits arrived. When he did finally catch up with Chacon, over three months later, Alvord first had to go with him to the Yaqui River, to sell some stolen horses, before going all the way back to the border. As the bandits were nearing the rendezvous, Alvord sent Stiles ahead to tell Mossman to meet them just south of the border, at the Socorro Mountain Springs, in Sonora. Mossman and Stiles failed to meet Alvord and Chacon in the Socorro Mountains, but, on the following night, they found the bandits at the home of Alvord's wife. There, after exchanging names, Mossman and the others agreed to cross the border back into Arizona on the next day, so they could steal some horses from Greene's Ranch that night. However, it was decided that it was too dark for stealing horses that night and the party went back to their camp, which was located less than seven miles north of the border. According to Raine, just before daybreak, on September 4, 1902, Alvord was preparing to leave when he \\"tiptoed\\" over to Mossman and said: \\"I brought Chacon to you, but you dont seem able to take him. Ive done my share and I dont want him to suspect me. Remember that if you take him you have promised that the reward shall go to me, and that youll stand by me at my trial if I surrender. You sure want to be mighty careful, or hell kill you. So long.\\" When Chacon awoke later that morning, his suspicions were aroused when he found that Alvord was no longer in camp. After breakfast, Stiles suggested that they go steal the horses in daylight, but Chacon was uninterested and said he was going back to Sonora. Mossman knew his time to act was now. Chacon and Stiles were sitting on the ground next to each other when Mossman stood up. First he asked for and received a cigarette from Chacon, then, as he dropped the twig he used to light his cigarette, Mossman pulled out his revolver and aimed it at Chacon. According to author William McLeod Raine, Mossman said: \\"Hands up, Chacon,\\" to which the bandit said: \\"Is this a joke?\\" Mossman replied: \\"No. Throw your hands up or youre a dead man.\\" Chacon then said: \\"I dont see as it makes any difference after he is dead whether a mans hands are up or down. Youre going to kill me anyway, why dont you shoot?\\" Mossman had Stiles disarm Chacon and then put him on a horse for the journey to the railroad, where they boarded a train to Benson. Of note is that several times Chacon attempted to escape by throwing himself off his horse, presumably at a place where Mossman could not easily follow, such as a steep hillside or something similar. The capture of Chacon was anticlimactic but Mossman's plan worked exactly as he hoped. Chacon was eventually hanged in Solomonville on November 21, 1902. =Later life and death= After the capture of Augustine Chacon, Mossman resigned from his position in July 1902 to focus on a peaceful life as a businessman in Bisbee, although rumors circulated that he was uninterested in working for the new governor, L. C. Hughes. Mossman later returned to the cattle business and purchased the Diamond A Ranch, near Roswell, New Mexico, where he died of old age on September 5, 1956. Mossman was buried at the Mount Washington Cemetery in Independence, Missouri and the Diamond A Ranch is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. According to historian David Leighton, of the Arizona Daily Star newspaper, Mossman Road in Tucson, Arizona, is named in honor of Burton C. Mossman.David Leighton, \\"Street Smarts: Slight but tough rancher helped tame wild, wooly Arizona,\\" Arizona Daily Star May 14, 2013 The actor Rory Calhoun played Mossman in the title role of the 1963 episode \\"The Measure of a Man\\" of the syndicated western television series, Death Valley Days, narrated by Stanley Andrews. In the story line, Mossman convinces a reluctant Burt Alvord (Bing Russell) to set a trap to catch the elusive bandit Augustine Chacon (Michael Pate). Mossman has Chacon handcuffed and orders the key to be tossed away. Chacon is hanged thereafter. In 1960, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.

(The film was re-released in 1958.) The film stars Wendell Corey, Vera Ralston, Forrest Tucker and Phil Harris. Wild Blue Yonder deals with the Boeing B-29 Superfortress air raids on Japan during World War II. Plot In 1943, Capt. Harold \\"Cal\\" Calvert (Wendell Corey) is sent on a course at Smoky Hill, Kansas, to learn to fly a new bomber, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. His instructor is his cousin, Major Tom West (Forrest Tucker), an officer who the other pilots think has shirked his duties by claiming engine trouble on the raid over the Ploesti oil fields. Cal stands up for Tom when a crewman taunts his cousin in front of Helen (Vera Ralston), a nurse that Tom has been seeing. Cal and the other students learn that the pressurized B-29 can fly higher, faster and farther than any other bomber. On a test flight, when an overconfident Cal pushes a B-29 higher than instructed, a sudden decompression nearly ends in tragedy. One of the crew is sucked out of the aircraft, but is able to use his parachute. Tom is furious and reprimands Cal for endangering the test program, which the Air Force brass is monitoring closely. Maj. Gen. Wolfe (Walter Brennan) finally declares that the pilots and the B-29s are ready for combat. He leads them to bases in China where they will launch attacks on Japan. Cal's first missions are harrowing, although the B-29s prove to be extremely effective. When the group is transferred to Guam, Tom is reunited with Helen, who is also assigned there. Cal is flying continually on high altitude missions, but Gen. Curtis E. LeMay (William Witney), the new commanding officer, changes tactics to more accurate low altitude raids that will produce more damage. Helen is slowly falling for the more heroic Cal, and when he and Tom are on a mission together in a mass raid on Tokyo, their B-29 is hit by anti-aircraft fire. With Cal wounded and Tom at the controls, the stricken aircraft barely makes it back to the base. Tom goes back into the fiery wreckage to save a trapped crewman, but is killed when the aircraft explodes. Several weeks later, as the war ends when B-29s drop the most devastating weapon of all, the atom bomb, on cities in Japan, Cal and Helen remain together. Cast * Wendell Corey as Capt.

In May 2011, aged 22, he became the youngest Briton to climb the Seven Summits - the highest mountain on each of the seven continents. In October 2019, he completed a 22,500 mile solo cycle around the world.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/geordie-stewart-cycles-the- globe-j6sc0cvjn Seven Summits Aged 18 he became one of the youngest Britons ever to summit Aconcagua, the highest mountain in South America. He then attempted a solo climb of Mount Kilimanjaro in May 2008 and reached the summit on his 19th birthday. His last expedition before starting at the University of St Andrews, was to Russia, where he reached the highest point in Europe, by summiting Mount Elbrus. In July 2009, he climbed the highest mountain in North America, Denali, before attempting Mount Everest the following year. Geordie got to within 150 m of the summit before turning around. He was heavily delayed on the ascent after helping a Sherpa and two teammates who were all suffering from severe altitude sickness. Over Christmas 2010, he climbed Vinson Massif in Antarctica, before completing the 6th mountain in his Seven Summits attempt, Carstensz Pyramid, Indonesia in March. Geordie returned to Everest in spring 2011 and became the youngest Briton to climb the Seven Summits. Geordie climbed in aid of Help for Heroes and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. His first four climbs were self-funded; the remaining three were sponsored. During the finale of his Seven Summits attempt, Geordie filmed a one-off documentary, The Ultimate Climb, for Discovery Channel, which aired in May 2012. In Search of Sisu In July 2018, Geordie published his first book In Search of Sisu: A Path to Contentment via the Highest Point on Every Continent which covers his Seven Summits journey on and off the mountains. Bear Grylls described it as ‚ÄòA raw and honest account. In Search of Sisu touches on key elements of human psychology, overcoming adversity and difficult decision making on an intensely personal journey.‚Äô Sir Ranulph Fiennes said the book was, 'Powerfully written and compelling. A must-read for anyone with an interest in adventure.‚Äô  Around the World Cycle  In August 2018, Geordie departed the UK to begin a long-distance cycle tour. He rode solo across four continents for 430 days and covered 22,500 miles. Geordie returned home to London in October 2018 having successfully completed his attempt to cycle around the world.

In case of free group these simpler elements are reduced words and in the case of free product of groups these are reduced sequences. The precise definitions of these are given below. As it turns out, for a free group and for the free product of groups, there exists a unique normal form i.e each element is representable by a simpler element and this representation is unique. This is the Normal Form Theorem for the free groups and for the free product of groups. The proof here of the Normal Form Theorem follows the idea of Artin and van der Waerden. Normal Form for Free Groups Let G be a free group with generating set S. Each element in G is represented by a word w=a_1\\\\cdots a_n, where a_j\\\\in S^{\\\\pm}, 1\\\\leqslant j\\\\leqslant n. Definition. A word is called reduced if it contains no string of the form aa^{-1}, a\\\\in S^{\\\\pm}. Definition. A normal form for a free group G with generating set S is a choice of a reduced word in S for each element of G. :Normal Form Theorem for Free Groups. A free group has a unique normal form i.e. each element in G is represented by a unique reduced word. Proof. An elementary transformation of a word w\\\\in G consists of inserting or deleting a part of the form aa^{-1} with a\\\\in S^{\\\\pm}. Two words w_1 and w_2 are equivalent, w_1\\\\equiv w_2, if there is a chain of elementary transformations leading from w_1 to w_2. This is obviously an equivalence relation on G. Let G_0 be the set of reduced words. We shall show that each equivalence class of words contains exactly one reduced word. It is clear that each equivalence class contains a reduced word, since successive deletion of parts aa^{-1} from any word w must lead to a reduced word. It will suffice then to show that distinct reduced words u and v are not equivalent. For each x\\\\in S define a permutation x\\\\Delta of G_0 by setting w(x\\\\Delta)=wx if wx is reduced and w(x\\\\Delta)=u if w=ux^{-1}. Let P be the group of permutations of G_0 generated by the x\\\\Delta, x\\\\in S. Let \\\\Delta^* be the multiplicative extension of \\\\Delta to a map \\\\Delta^*:W\\\\mapsto P. If u_1\\\\equiv u_2, then u_1\\\\Delta^*=u_2\\\\Delta^*; moreover 1(u\\\\Delta^*) =u_0 is reduced with u_0\\\\equiv u. It follows that if u_1\\\\equiv u_2 with u_1, u_2 reduced, then u_1=u_2. Normal Form for Free Products Let G = A* B be the free product of groups A and B. Every element w\\\\in G is represented by w = g_1 \\\\cdots g_n where g_j\\\\in A \\\\text{ or } B for 1\\\\leqslant j\\\\leqslant n. Definition. A reduced sequence is a sequence g_1, \\\\cdots, g_n such that for 1\\\\leqslant j\\\\leqslant n we have g_j \\\\in A \\\\text{ or } B, g_j eq e and g_j, g_{j+1} are not in the same factor A or B. The identity element is represented by the empty set. Definition. A normal form for a free product of groups is a representation or choice of a reduced sequence for each element in the free product. :Normal Form Theorem for Free Product of Groups. Consider the free product A*B of two groups A and B. Then the following two equivalent statements hold. ::(1) If w=g_1\\\\cdots g_n, n>0, where g_1,\\\\cdots, g_n is a reduced sequence, then w eq 1 in A*B. ::(2) Each element of A*B can be written uniquely as w=g_1\\\\cdots g_n where g_1,\\\\cdots ,g_n is a reduced sequence. =Proof= Equivalence The fact that the second statement implies the first is easy. Now suppose the first statement holds and let: :g_1 \\\\cdots g_m = w = h_1 \\\\cdots h_n. This implies :h_n^{-1}\\\\cdots h_1^{-1}g_1 \\\\cdots g_m = 1. Hence by first statement left hand side cannot be reduced. This can happen only if h_1^{-1}g_1 =1, i.e. g_1=h_1. Proceeding inductively we have m = n and g_i = h_i for all 1\\\\leqslant i\\\\leqslant n. This shows both statements are equivalent. Proof of (2) Let be the set of all reduced sequences in and be its group of permutations. Define as follows: : \\\\varphi(a)(g_1,g_2,\\\\cdots ,g_m) = \\\\begin{cases} (g_1, g_2, \\\\cdots, g_m) & \\\\text{if } a = 1  (a,g_1,g_2,\\\\cdots ,g_m) & \\\\text{if } g_1\\\\in B  (ag_1,g_2,\\\\cdots ,g_m) & \\\\text{if } g_1\\\\in A \\\\text{ and }ag_1 eq 1  (g_2,g_3,\\\\cdots ,g_m) & \\\\text{if } g_1\\\\in A \\\\text{ and } ag_1=1. \\\\end{cases} Similarly we define . It is easy to check that and are homomorphisms. Therefore by universal property of free product we will get a unique map such that Now suppose w=g_1\\\\cdots g_n, n>0, where (g_1, \\\\cdots, g_n) is a reduced sequence, then \\\\phi *\\\\psi (w)(1)=(g_1,\\\\cdots, g_n).

Revolution at Sea. The Hour, August 20, 1999, p B2. Storyline The Revolution at Sea saga focuses on Isaac Biddlecomb and Ezra Rumstick, former smugglers for Isaac's surrogate father (and later father in law) William Stanton. Over the course of the series, Biddlecomb and Rumstick become increasingly involved with the naval aspect of the American Revolution, which brings them into contact with historical figures such as Benjamin Franklin and George Washington. Installments The following titles represent the five novels in the Revolution at Sea Saga: # By Force of Arms (1997) # The Maddest Idea (1997) # The Continental Risque (1998) # Lords of the Ocean (1999) # All the Brave Fellows (2001) The following title is not part of the Revolution at Sea Saga, but uses several of the same characters: * The French Prize (2015) Characters (see Minor characters in the Revolution at Sea Saga) The following is a list of the major characters in the Revolution at Sea Saga. =Isaac Biddlecomb= The protagonist of the series, a merchant turned naval captain. Biddlecomb becomes increasingly successful in his naval endeavors over the course of the series, leading him to increased fame within the American Navy and the Revolution itself. In Lords of the Ocean, Biddlecomb marries childhood friend Virginia Stanton. They have a son together, Jack Biddlecomb, who would later be the protagonist of The French Prize, a sequel to the Revolution at Sea Saga. =Ezra Rumstick= An old friend and shipmate of Biddlecomb's, Rumstick is a fierce revolutionary who becomes increasingly embroiled in the war, often while sailing alongside Biddlecomb. =Virginia Biddlecomb (n√©e Stanton)= The rebellious daughter of William Stanton, Biddlecomb's employer and surrogate father, Virginia comes to love Biddlecomb and the two are married, eventually having a son together. =William Stanton= An American merchant who employed first Biddlecomb's father, then Biddlecomb himself. Stanton was responsible for introducing Biddlecomb to Rumstick, and caring for Biddlecomb when his father was killed. Stanton later became Biddlecomb's father-in-law, and Jack Biddlecomb's grandfather. =Elisha Faircloth= Commander of the marines aboard Biddlecomb's ship, the USS Charlemagne. =Edward Fitzgerald= Major Edward Fitzgerald is advisor to George Washington in The Maddest Idea. Although his personality and character traits were created by the author, it is a historic fact that Washington had a right-hand man by the same name. In The Maddest Idea, he is assigned with the job of flushing out the traitor who turned Biddlecomb over to the British; Fitzgerald appears again in Lords of the Ocean.

It advocated the use of mercury to make the body immortal. This school was based on the texts RasƒÅr·πáava, Rasah·πõidaya and Rase≈õvarasiddhƒÅnta, composed by Govinda Bhagavat and Sarvaj√±a RƒÅme≈õvara. Overview Rase≈õvaras, like many other schools of Indian philosophy, believed that liberation was identity of self with Supreme lord Shiva and freedom from transmigration. However, unlike other schools, Rase≈õvaras thought that liberation could only be achieved by using mercury to acquire an imperishable body.Dash, p .38-39 Hence, they called mercury pƒÅrada or the means of conveyance beyond transmigratory existence.Cowell and Gough. p. 137 Extrication of soul to Rase≈õvaras was a cognizable act and therefore, for liberation it was necessary to maintain an imperishable bodily life. They used scriptural evidence from the Purusha Sukta and Puranas to support this point of view.Cowell and Gough, p. 141-142. Usage of mercury Mercury was sacred to the Rase≈õvaras, so much so that they considered disparaging mercury blasphemy.Cowell and Gough, p. 143. Rasah·πõidaya mentions mercury to be a creation by Shiva and Gauri whereas, RasƒÅr·πáava holds the worship of mercury to be more beatific than the worship of all symbols of supreme lord Shiva. Rase≈õvaras described eighteen methods of treating mercury‚Äîsweating, rubbing, swooning, fixing, dropping, coercion, restraining, kindling, going, falling into globules, pulverising, covering, internal flux, external flux, burning, colouring, pouring, and eating it by parting and piercing it. Mercury could applied to both blood and body.Cowell and Gough, p. 140 Rase≈õvarasiddhƒÅnta described three modes in which mercury could be used together with air‚Äîswooning, dead and bound. Swooning mercury and air were thought to carry diseases, dead they were thought to restore life and bound they were thought to give the power of levitation. Mercury was described as swooning when it was of various colours and free from excessive volatility. It was dead when it showed wetness, thickness, brightness, heaviness and mobility. And it was bound when it was continuous, fluent, luminous, pure, heavy, and if it parted under friction.Cowell and Gough, p.139 However, it is now known that exposure to mercury and its compounds causes hydrargyria or mercury poisoning.
