It was made up of members of a coalition between the Liberal Party and the Country Party, led by Doug Anthony as Deputy Prime Minister. The McMahon Government lasted from March 1971 to December 1972, being defeated at the 1972 federal election. Writing for the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Julian Leeser describes McMahon's prime ministership as \\"a blend of cautious innovation and fundamental orthodoxy\\". Background Then-Prime Minister John Gorton with William McMahon shortly after the unsuccessful leadership challenge in 1969. John Gorton became Prime Minister of Australia on 10 January 1968. He was chosen to lead the Liberal Party in place of Harold Holt, who had drowned in rough surf off the Victorian coast. William McMahon was then serving as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, but Country Party leader John McEwen ruled out maintaining the Coalition if McMahon became Prime Minister. McMahon as Treasurer had resisted McEwen's support for high levels of protection for manufacturing.Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978 Defence and Australia's commitment to the Vietnam War was a prominent issue during the term of the Gorton Government; funding for the arts was expanded, rates of pay were standardised between the men and women and the mining industry grew during the period. A policy of economic centralisation led to friction with State leaders and difficulties within the coalition. Gorton departed the office of Prime Minister on 10 March 1971 after a tied Liberal party room vote of confidence in his leadership.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/in- office.aspx The Liberal-Country Party Coalition had been in office continually since 1949. In April 1967, Gough Whitlam replaced Arthur Calwell as leader of the Labor Party and Leader of the Opposition. Labor reduced the Gorton Government's majority and came within four seats of government at the 1969 election; McMahon unsuccessfully challenged Gorton for the leadership in the aftermath. The government also performed poorly in the 1970 half-Senate election, adding to pressures on Gorton's leadership. Defence minister Malcolm Fraser developed an uneasy relationship with Gorton and in early 1971, Fraser accused Gorton of being disloyal to him in a conflict with Army officials over progress in South Vietnam.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/fraser/before- office.aspx On 8 March 1971, Fraser resigned and announced in parliament the following day that Gorton was \\"not fit to hold the great office of Prime Minister\\". On 10 March, the Liberal party room moved to debate and vote on a motion of confidence in Gorton as party leader, resulting in a 33‚Äì33 tie. In response Gorton said ‚Äòthat is not a vote of confidence‚Äô and resigned as leader. By this time John McEwen had dropped his veto of McMahon. McMahon replaced Gorton as Prime Minister. Gorton was elected deputy leader. His relations with Fraser did not recover.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/mcmahon/in-office.aspx William McMahon had joined the Parliament in 1949 and by 1951 had been promoted to Minister for the Navy and for the Air. He had served as a major during the Second World War, and worked on home defence. He served as Minister for Primary Industry (1956‚Äì58) and Minister for Labour and National Service (1958‚Äì66) in the Menzies Government, then as Treasurer (1966‚Äì69) in the Holt Government and Gorton Government, and finally as Minister for External Affairs (1969‚Äì71) in the Gorton government. He was married to Sonia McMahon, who maintained a high public profile. Term in office Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Country Party, Doug Anthony. William \\"Bill\\" McMahon became Prime Minister of Australia on 10 March 1971, at the age of 63. The McMahon Ministry was sworn in by Governor-General Paul Hasluck with Country Party leader Doug Anthony as Deputy Prime Minister. McMahon moved Gorton's Treasurer, Leslie Bury to the Ministry for External Affairs and installed Billy Snedden as Treasurer. After taking office, McMahon told the press in March 1971: United States President Richard Nixon with Prime Minister McMahon at the White House in 1971. Disunity continued to affect the Government, following the replacement of Gorton. Gorton had taken the senior Cabinet position of Minister for Defence but was forced to resign from Cabinet in August 1971, after McMahon accused him of breaching Cabinet solidarity. =Defence Policy= McMahon maintained Australia's diminishing commitment to Vietnam and criticised Opposition leader, Gough Whitlam, for visiting Communist China in 1972 ‚Äì only to have the US President Richard Nixon announce a planned visit soon after. Anticipating a US withdrawal, the McMahon Government announced an 'accelerated withdrawal' of Australian troops in Vietnam in July 1971. =Indigenous Affairs= Bill Wentworth occupied the new post of Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. During McMahon's period in office, Neville Bonner joined the Senate and became the first Indigenous Australian in the Australian Parliament.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/timeline/results.aspx Bonner was chosen by the Liberal Party to fill a Senate vacancy in 1971 and celebrated his maiden parliamentary speech with a boomerang throwing display on the lawns of Parliament. Bonner went on to win election at the 1972 election and served as a Liberal Senator for 12 years. He worked on Indigenous and social welfare issues and proved an independent minded Senator, often crossing the floor on Parliamentary votes. Land Rights were a topical issue during the term of the McMahon Government and in 1972, Aboriginal protestors set up a Tent Embassy on the lawns in front of Parliament House. The government accepted the recommendations of the Gibb committee on Aboriginal employment, which included the lease of land at Wattie Creek to the Gurindji people, who had been staging a strike on a section of the Vestey company lease since 1966. =Economy= As the 1972 election approached, inflation and unemployment were increasing and the world economy was entering the 1970s decline. In 1971, the Government delivered a deflationary budget in response to economic conditions- but in 1972, faced with the challenge of Gough Whitlam's vast program of expenditure, Treasurer Snedden delivered a more election-friendly high spending budget. =1972 Election= The McMahon Government ended when Gough Whitlam led the Australian Labor Party out of its 23-year period in Opposition at 2 December 1972 election. The charismatic Whitlam led an effective campaign that resulted in Labor securing 67 seats to the Coalition's 58, leaving McMahon as the first non-Labor leader to suffer an election defeat since 1946. Aftermath McMahon did not recontest the leadership of the Liberal Party and became a backbencher. Several candidates ran for the party leadership, including John Gorton, but the party settled on Billy Snedden with Phillip Lynch as Deputy. McMahon remained in the parliament as a backbencher for 10 years after losing office as Prime Minister. He retired in 1982.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/mcmahon/after-office.aspx Snedden led the Coalition to the 1974 Election. Malcolm Fraser became leader of the Liberals and led the Coalition to a landslide victory against Gough Whitlam's Labor Party, following the 1975 Dismissal of the Whitlam Government.

The elections, held November 30, 2002 and January 4, 2003, were officially nonpartisan and each held as general elections without primaries to pick a successor for the remainder of her term in the 107th Congress and for the next term in the 108th Congress, to which Mink was posthumously re-elected. Both elections were won by Democrat Ed Case. Background On August 30, 2002, Mink was hospitalized in Honolulu's Straub Clinic and Hospital with complications from chickenpox. Her condition steadily worsened, and on September 28, 2002, Mink died in Honolulu of viral pneumonia. The week prior to her untimely death, she had won renomination. By this point, it was too late to remove her name from the general election ballot. On November 5, 2002, Mink was posthumously re-elected over state Representative Bob McDermott (R). As a result, this triggered two separate special elections: the first to fill the vacancy during the end of the 107th Congress and the second for the new term beginning on January 3, 2003. In accordance with Hawaiian law the elections were single nonpartisan races without primaries.  Election to the 107th Congress (November 30, 2002)  The two most notable candidates to compete in the first election were then- state representative and former state House Majority Leader Ed Case and John Mink, the former husband of the late Congresswoman. Despite the latter's connections to the district's prior representative, Case would win the election with fifty-one percent of the vote.  Election to the 108th Congress (January 4, 2003)  The now-freshman incumbent Case immediately ran for reelection in the early January 2003 race for the second district seat in the 108th Congress, going up against more than three dozen other candidates. Other Democrats included state Senators Matt Matsunaga and Colleen Hanabusa. Republicans included state Representatives Barbara Marumoto and Bob C. McDermott, and former Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi. Case won this election with 43 percent of the vote.

The company operates its primary retail store at The Royal Exchange in London, with the company‚Äôs administrative HQ in Stoke-on- Trent, Staffordshire, England, and its enamel production facility situated at its Strawberry site in the West Midlands, England. Products can be purchased at the store, online at www.halcyondays.co.uk, and at other fine retailers worldwide including Harrods, Fortnum & Mason, Selfridges, Neiman Marcus and Scully & Scully of New York, to name a few. It is one of a very small number of companies to have held all four Royal Warrants, including that of the late Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and still today is one of only 14 companies to hold all three Royal Warrants, as Suppliers of Objets d'Art to the households of the British Royal Family. The warrants held are those of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and HRH Charles, Prince of Wales.  History  Founded by Susan Benjamin in 1950, Halcyon Days was initially a small antiques shop based on Avery Row in London which specialised in dealing with English antiques, in particular small enamel boxes. By 1959 the company had outgrown its original premises and moved to its home on Brook Street, where it remained for some 50 years. It now operates a shop in the Royal Exchange in the City of London and from its offices and showroom in Knightsbridge, London Whilst the English craft of enameling onto copper flourished during the 18th century, by the 1830s it had almost disappeared; consequently the pieces which Halcyon Days specialised in were extremely rare. In 1970 Susan Benjamin established a collaboration with enamel manufacturer Bilston and Battersea Enamels. In 1978 Halcyon Days was granted the Royal Warrant of Queen Elizabeth II, followed in 1987 by the Royal Warrants of the Duke of Edinburgh and The Prince of Wales, as the first ever ‚ÄòSuppliers of Objets d‚ÄôArt‚Äô. By the 1980s the company began to produce new products in bone china and porcelain, and these now form a major part of the company's luxury goods portfolio, alongside the enamel jewellery and accessories collections launched in 2011. In 2016, the enamel jewellery line is joined by a new fashion watch collection. In 2008 the company opened a new workshop at Tipton. Today all enamel pieces are still hand-produced at the Strawberry production facility, and its fine bone china is made at its owned facility in Stoke-on-Trent. = Products = Halcyon Days‚Äô enamel products include boxes, musical boxes, cufflinks, and bangles. A number of the enamel ranges are produced as limited editions - and commemorative products are key. The company also produces items in English fine bone china, manufactured in Stoke-on-Trent by a team of artisans ranging from dinnerware to teaware, and gifts. Enamel bangles launched in 2011 are now sought after, and the jewellery range includes pendants and earrings, along with a fashion watch collection. Silk scarves, throws in cashmere, and leather gifts complete the assortment. Cufflinks in sterling silver & enamel make fine gifts for men.  Commissions and collaborations  One of the first commissions received was in 1970 soon after the launch of Halcyon Days Enamels, by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother for a box depicting Clarence House. In 1976, the New York Times reported that, on an official visit to the USA in the year of the Bicentennial celebrations, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh presented U.S. President Gerald Ford with a special Halcyon Days box. By coincidence, the President gave the Queen another special Halcyon Days box, commissioned through Cartier, New York, to celebrate the occasion. Over the years, the business has collaborated with The Wallace Collection, The National Gallery, Blenheim Palace, Smithsonian Institution, The Frick, Fortnum & Mason, British Museum, Tate Gallery, and the National Gallery.

He was also the first ever Governor of Mizoram among the Garos in 1989. Captain Williamson A. Sangma was a statesman, tribal leader, and a pioneer in leading the struggle for the creation of Meghalaya state, the homeland of three ancient hill communities -- Garos, Jaintias, and Khasis - The Khasis and the Jaintas are believed to be the remnants of the first Mongolian migration into India, while the Garos migrated from originally inhabited province Torus, Tibet. Biography Capt. W.A. Sangma was born in Baghmara, South Garo Hills district. He always represented Baghmara assembly constituency, even after merging his political outfit in Congress(I) party. He along with Salseng C. Marak are the only Meghalaya Chief Minister's to complete full term of five years in office. A biography of Capt. Williamson A. Sangma was written by Mihir N. Sangma. =Hill state movement= With prior military service, he entered political field in 1952, and subsequently was elected as the Chief executive member of the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council(GHADC). On 16 June 1954, the members of the executive committees of the Autonomous District Council of the Garo Hills(GHADC), the Khasi(Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council), Jaintia Hills(Jaintia Hills Autonomous District Council), the Lushai Hills(Mizo Hills), and the North Cachar Hills District Council held a meeting at Shillong, and pleaded for the establishment of a separate Hill state on the ground that there was no adequate safeguard for the preservation of the identity of the hill people in Sixth Schedule of Constitution of India. The meeting demanded for the constitution of a separate state for all the hill areas of Assam, called \\"Eastern Hill State.\\" Accordingly, they, including W.A. Sangma as a Chief sent a set of suggestions for amendment of the Sixth Schedule to the Members of Indian parliament. Though Wilson Reade, chairman of the Khasi National Durba, was the first one to demand a separate hill state, it was W.A. Sangma who accelerated the movement successfully. He led the sustained struggle by the Garos, Jaintas, and the Khasis, for the hill state from the 1950s. He being the first Chief executive member of Garo Hills Autonomous District Council(GHADC), called a conference of the people of the autonomous hill districts of then-Assam at Tura on 6‚Äì8 October 1954, to consider the demand of a hill state. An appeal was sent to the leaders of all the tribal organisations and parties of the autonomous districts to sign the memorandum. Under his leadership, the conference passed the resolution to submit a memorandum to the States Reorganisation Commission(SRC) for the formation of a separate \\"Eastern Hills State.\\" The memorandum emphasising the following points was submitted to SRC: # The people of the hills and the plains differed from each other. # The attempt of the Assamese people to impose their language and culture on the hill tribes. # The Assamese dominance in the legislature and the services, and # The autonomy granted under the Sixth Schedule was not adequate. The issue of separate state had become an election issue in 1957 general elections in Assam. The EITU, United Mizo Freedom Organization(UMFO), the Mizo Union, and the Garo National Union captured majority of seats giving the impetus and popular mandate for the Hills movement, while the Congress lost‚Äîall five seats in the United Khasi-Jaintia Hills, three seats in Garo Hills, and one seat in Mikir Hills and North Cachar Hills. Bimala Prasad Chaliha with confidence from hills people, became the Chief Minister of Assam. In 1957, Sangma was elected to Assam Legislative Assembly. In the following year, he joined the cabinet of Assam to look after the departments of tribal regions, information, publicity, and transport. After the Indian independence, when the Nagas declared war against India, the tribes inhabiting the Khasi-Jhantia-Garo Hills extended co- operation to Government of Assam; as a result, Williamson Sangma was taken in the cabinet of Chaliha, Chief Minister of Assam, as a Cabinet minister in charge of the \\"Tribal Areas Department.\\" When the Assamese language bill was passed in spite of opposition from tribal people later, he resigned from the cabinet to fight for the cause of separate statehood. Imposition of Assamese state language impact In 1960, the Assam Provincial Congress Committee(APCC) met on 22 April 1960, and directed the Chief Minister Chaliha to declare the Assamese as the State language. This further infuriated the tribal people, but accelerated the movement for Hills state, and subsequently in a \\"All Assam Hills leaders conference\\" held at Tura, Garo Hills, on 28 April 1960, they vehemently opposed the imposition of Assamese language and demanded the immediate amendment of the Sixth Schedule. With outbreak of violence between the Assamese speaking and Bengali speaking communities in the Assam plains, it further united the Hill parties and Hill state movement gained its momentum once again. In June 1960, W.A. Sangma called for a conference of all leaders of all the political parties in the hill areas. The conference unanimously resolved to oppose the \\"Official Language Bill\\". It also resolved to form the \\"All Party Hill Leaders Conference\\"(APHLC), with W.A. Sangma as its first chairman. In September 1960, the APHLC's Council of Action issued an ultimatum to the Assam CM; consequently, W.A. Sangma resigned his cabinet post from the government in protest against the official Assamese language policy adopted by the Assam government. Assam assembly adopted the Assamese as State language on the night of 24 October 1960. Following which, the third APHLC met at Haflong in North Cachar and demanded for the immediate creation of a separate Hill state. New government proposals Under the leadership of Sangma, APHLC met Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India(PM), in November 1960, and raised the apprehensions of Assamese language on Tribals. Nehru, however, opposed the proposal for a separate state. When the delegation met Nehru again in December 1960, Nehru offered a Scottish plan‚Äîfull authority for tribals in internal matters and complete control over expenditures and freedom in regard to the language - it also has a constitution of the committee in the Legislative Assembly of Assam comprising all the MLA's from the hills to examine the legislative proposals for the hill areas. The APHLC in its fourth session at Shillong in April 1961, rejected the proposal, and resolved to boycott the 1962 general elections. While APHLC rejected the Scottish plan, District Congress Committee accepted it and decided to contest the elections in 1961. APHLC's Council of Action, with an intention to prevent a split, decided to contest the elections, and consequently APHLC won 11 out of 15 seats contested. In 1963, the Mizo Union revolted its stand against APHLC as they felt their individuality would be lost by joining the Khasis and the Garos. When Sangma and it's APHLC delegation met Nehru on 10 June 1963, a new plan was proposed with name Nehru plan‚Äîthat contemplated that the hill areas of Assam must remain within the state of Assam, enjoying the ninety percent autonomy of a state - there should be a Cabinet minister as in-charge of administration of the hill areas - Hill minister would have to act according to the norms of Cabinet government. Nehru plan, however, was opposed by Government of Assam, Chief Minister of Assam, and the Congress party itself in Assam. After the death of Nehru, Indira Gandhi had chaired as Prime Minister of India in 1966. APHLC, having decided to boycott 1967 general elections. submitted another memorandum to Indira Gandhi demanding a separate Hill state when she visited Shillong in December 1966. Indira instead, proposed for Reorganization plan, with an official statement from Government of India on 13 January 1967 to reorganise the state of Assam on the basis of a Federal structure conferring upon the hill areas equal status with the rest of the state of Assam. Communist Party of India, stepped-in differing from APHLC and Congress on Federal structure in name of reorganisation and called for a National integration of tribal people with mainstream of Indian life, rather than merely looking from the development angle of tribal people with the statement: Sangma and APHLC delegation, having welcomed the Federal structure proposal decided to participate in a committee composed of representatives from APHLC, Government of India, and the Government of Assam to work out the details of the proposed Federal scheme, subject to the conditions that in the Federal structure, the hill state unit should have equal voice and status with the units comprising the remaining state of Assam. With bitter opposition from APCC faction opposed to Chief Minister Chaliha, the committee was not constituted to work out the details of the Federal scheme. Instead, a joint discussion in Delhi on 7 July 1967, with representatives from various political parties of the Plains and the APHLC was called, to make an effort to reach an agreed solution for the reorganisation of Assam. APHLC boycotted the commission as it not only opposed the Federal idea, but also resigned all the seats it held in Khasi, and the Garo hills on 25 May 1968. APHLC started a non-violent Satyagraha on 10 September 1968 for the statehood. =Autonomous state= With Satyagraha protest, Government of India precipitated and consequently on 11 September 1968, produced the Autonomous State Plan for the Garo Hills and the United Khasi-Jaintia Hills districts. The Mikir and the North Cachar Hills districts were given the option to join the Autonomous state‚Äîthey decided to stay within the Assam state. On 24 December 1969, Parliament of India passed the \\"Assam Reorganization(Meghalaya) Bill\\", to create an Autonomous state‚Äîto be known as Meghalaya, within the state of Assam comprising the United Khasi-Jaintia Hills district and the Garo hills district as defined in the Sixth Schedule. =Meghalaya state= The faction that opposed Autonomous state left the APHLC led by W.A. Sangma and formed a separate party with name Hill State People's Democratic Party (HSPDP). To counter the influence gained by HSPDP in certain areas, APHLC requested PM on 3 September 1970, to declare Meghalaya as a full-fledged state. On 10 November 1970, the Government informed the Lok Sabha that the government had decided to accept in principle the Meghalaya demand for statehood. Finally, on 21 January 1972, Meghalaya state has become a full-fledged state. The peace in then autonomous districts of Assam was disturbed when the state administration decided to impose Assamese language as the state language using The Official Languages Bill on 18 October 1960 threatening the tribes, who were apprehensive of losing their culture and identity; consequently, he feared that the Assam government's linguistic policy would militate against the ethnic identity of the hill people and hence, he led the agitations that resulted them an autonomous status under the \\"Assam reorganisation(Meghalaya) Act 1969,\\" until it became a full-fledged state on 21 January 1972. Prior to becoming full-fledged Meghalaya state of the Indian Union, the present areas of Meghalaya enjoyed internal autonomy under the provisions of Sixth Schedule of Constitution of India‚Äîit also had District Councils in the Garo Hills and the United Khasi and Jaintia Hills Districts. According to B.B. Lyngdoh, former Chief Minister of Meghalaya, who shared the Chief Minister's office with Capt.Williamson Sangma, is said to have told that the imposition of Assamese language in 1960 was the sole reason for the fight of separate statehood, for Garo, Jhantia, and Khasis areas to be carved out as Meghalaya state: ALL STORY, =Post-Meghalaya state formation= In Meghalaya legislative assembly elections held in March 1972, after the new state was established, regional parties secured majority, while Congress secured nine seats out of total 60 seats in assembly. W.A. Sangma of APHLC sworn in as its first Chief Minister with majority. However, with politics of defections and coalitions later, a faction of the APHLC led by W.A. Sangma merged with the Congress after the APHLC's Mendipather conference in 1976. This new merger provided the Congress strong footing in the new state, Meghalaya, particularly in the Garo Hills and east Khasi Hills. With realisation of Meghalaya as a state, it ultimately united the areas of the Khasi, Jainta, and the Garo Hills under the leadership of Williamson Sangma. He being one of the major leaders of the hill statehood movement, he always craved for a better deal for the Garos, who were economically worse off than their Khasi-Jainta brethren. He also made sure the Meghalaya Board of School Education (MBOSE), which he considered to be of prime importance, was in Garo Hills. In his honour After his death in 1999, succeeding Government of Meghalaya honoured him by naming several of public properties, including educational institutes on his name. * The State Museum of Meghalaya, founded in 1975, was named Williamson Sangma Museum. * the headquarters complex of the East Garo Hills district of Meghalaya, was christened after him as Williamnagar. * Baljek airport in West Garo Hills is named after him. * Captain Williamson Sangma Technical University in Tura, Meghalaya. * Capt Williamson Memorial College, at Baghmara, in 1994. * An award on his name Capt.

Background Tarnavsky was born into a family of priests in a village in the Lviv region. He attended a village grade school and a German gymnasium in Brody, western Ukraine.

Her non-fiction book Sex and Power: Defining History, Shaping Societies was published in 2008. She is the founder of the 50 Million Missing online campaign to raise awareness of female gendercide in India.  Early career  Banerji started her career as an environmentalist specializing in Conservation Biology. In 1995 she received the Amy Lutz award in Plant Biology from the Association for Women in Science (AWIS) for her PhD work on the effects of acid rain on maize. Other awards and recognitions she has received include: Morgan Adams Award in Biology for PhD Research; Sigma Xi Scientific Research Society, Associate member; Botanical Society of America‚Äôs Young Botanist Recognition Award; Charles A. Dana Fellowship for Research in Ecology; Howard Hughes Grant for research in genetics. She was also listed in Who's Who Among Students in American Universities and Colleges. Many of Banerji's projects had a gender perspective. She worked with the Chipko women's grassroots movement in India under the tutelage of eco-feminist Vandana Shiva and for the Institute for Policy Studies and World Resources Institute.  Transition to Writing and Gender Activism  At the age of 30 Banerji returned to India and began to write on issues of gender equality and women's rights in India. Her writings and photos have been published in a range of journals and magazines in different countries. In 2009 she received the Apex Award of Excellence for Magazine and Journal Writing.  Sex and Power  Banerji's non-fiction book Sex and Power:Defining History, Shaping Societies was first published in India in 2008. The book was the result of a five-year social and historical study of sex and sexuality in India. In the book Banerji examines why current day India is squeamish about sex, despite a historical openness about the subject shown by worship of lingam and yoni, erotic art in temples, and literature on the art and science of love-making such as the Kama Sutra. She concludes that a society's sexual mores vary over time and are linked to the social groups in power.  The 50 Million Missing Campaign  In December 2006 Banerji started 50 Million Missing, an online advocacy campaign to raise awareness of female gendercide in India. The campaign was launched on Flickr, collecting thousands of photos of Indian girls and women from over 2400 photographers. Since its launch the campaign has grown and spread to other social networking sites and also runs information blogs. It is a zero-fund campaign and runs on community effort and participation. The campaign was a consequence of Banerji's book Sex and Power. She says, ‚ÄúThe data on the systemic and mass-scale violence on Indian women and girls I was gathering for my book was playing out in its stark grotesqueness in my everyday reality. A baby girl is abandoned on the streets in my city, and as residents wait for the police to respond, street dogs kill her and start eating her‚Ä¶I saw the connection and for the first time felt uneasy, ashamed and outraged.\\" Banerji contends that the three worst disasters that India faces in the 21st century, are population explosion, an AIDS epidemic, and the female gendercide. These she concludes are a result of India's deeply patriarchal and conservative approach to women and sexual morality, and the \\"socialized dichotomy\\" of men from women, and sex from the sacred. In an interview with The Big Issue in the North Banerji says the underlying problem with all three issues is a \\"virulent patriarchy that is self-indulgent...through [its practice of] multiple partners and irresponsible sex, and it essentially views women as sexual commodities to be used and discarded at will. A woman's only worth is in her production of sons for the continuation of the patriarchy. So daughters are routinely discarded before or soon after birth.\\"  Views on India‚Äôs female gendercide  Banerji has argued against the view that education and economic development are the solution to India's female gendercide. She states that an analysis of census data indicates that the gender ratio is most imbalanced in the top 20% of the population of India by wealth and education and that the ratio is closest to the natural norm in the bottom 20% of the same scale. She asserts that increased access to education, health care, jobs and higher earnings lead to more abortions of unborn female children, drawing a direct correlation between the number of educational degrees a woman has and the likelihood that she will eliminate unborn daughters. Banerji also claims that high-income professional women are also victims of dowry violence and murder in India. Their education and wealth is no protection, because they are unable to fight off the family and cultural pressures on them to remain in the marriage, regardless of the violence they are subjected to. Banerji contends that it is not economics or education, but rather a cultural misogyny that is the prime factor in India's female gendercide. She says this is most evident in how culture specific crimes like dowry murders and ‚Äòhonour' killings hound expatriate Indian women too, and sex-selected abortion is so prevalent, that the Indian communities in certain western countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Norway too have sex ratios that are abnormally skewed against females. Banerji asserts that gendercide needs to be recognised as a gender based hate crime against women, what Diana Russell has termed as ‚ÄòFemicide,‚Äô and be dealt with in the same manner as other hate crimes based on race, religion or ethnicity. . She explains that this lethal hatred of females is rooted in India‚Äôs history, religions and traditions, which over the centuries have created a socially permissive environment for extreme and deadly violence against females. She calls this ‚Äúthe acculturation of female homicide.\\" She says,‚Äúterms [like] sati, bride-burning, dowry death, doodh-peeti, kuri-mar, and jauhar‚Ä¶[are each] a method of female homicide that was [or still is] widely practised, widely accepted, and culturally-specific to India... When a practice acquires a name in a society, it becomes acceptable at the subconscious level of that community's collective thinking. Its premise becomes sacrosanct, and the lines between crime and culture, and what is permissible and reprehensible, become blurred. It is this deep, historically- rooted acculturation of female homicide that is sustaining female genocide in India. ‚Äù  A Call for a Feminist Revolution in India  According to Banerji, India has not experienced a sexual revolution in the same way as that seen in Europe and North America, which established each woman's independent and individual rights and choices over her own body and sexuality. She believes it is very important for the women's movement in India to have such a revolution particularly in context of putting the gendercide in perspective for Indian society. As she points out, this is because, ‚ÄúIt is about the recognition of women as individuals with certain fundamental rights, including that of safety and personal choices, which no one, not even the family, can violate‚Ä¶ A girl or woman, within the Indian cultural context, is regarded as a family‚Äôs property. She does not have the ownership of her own body‚Ä¶ And so it is the parents, the husbands, and in-laws who have the prerogative to decide and make the choices regarding a girl or a woman‚Äôs being. Whether or not she is allowed to live [before or] after birth‚Ä¶Who she can or cannot marry‚Ä¶ Her husband is entitled to sex whether she wants it or not. He decides when and how many children he wants and what sex they should be. He and his family can torture her to extort more dowry wealth, or subjugate her to repeated pregnancies and excruciating abortions to rid female progeny as always is the case with female feticides‚Ä¶[There is] yet another constrictive, dictatorial authority that asserts its power over an individual woman‚Äôs being in India ‚Äì that of culture and society. It decides what constitutes the prototype of a \\"good Indian woman\\" ‚Äì and directs everything from her demeanor and costume, to what her roles and goals in society ought to be.. \\"  Interviews  Women on Women's Rights: With Rita Banerji Women's Web, 26 September 2012 Alam Bains.

Mains electricity was installed in 1976, the light was automated in 1988 and is now operated remotely by the Northern Lighthouse Board from Edinburgh. The former keepers' cottages and outbuildings are owned by the Ardnamurchan Lighthouse Trust and operated as a visitor centre, with a museum called the 'Kingdom of Light' - Rioghachd na Sorcha. Exhibits detail the history and operations of the lighthouse, including access to the restored engine room and workshop with the original fog horn. Other displays include the geology and natural history of the area, and local social history and culture. A part-time light keeper is retained by the Northern Lighthouse Board who is based at Ardnamurchan and who also looks after Rubha nan Gall and Corran Point lighthouses.

Its intended use is as a foundation on which local, state and federal emergency management stakeholders can build a comprehensive disaster logistics program. The Universal Logistics Standard was developed by the Regional Logistics Program under the oversight of the NY-NJ-CT-PA Regional Catastrophic Planning Team, which is funded as part of the US Department of Homeland Security's Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant Program to support all-hazard planning and coordination of response for catastrophic events. Universal Logistics Standard Diagram  Background  In 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast and posed serious logistical challenges to the governmental agencies, volunteer organizations, private sector partners and individual citizens that were active in the response and recovery operations. While the magnitude of the Hurricane Katrina disaster is widely considered a key factor for the logistics failures that ensued in its aftermath, evaluations and research on the logistical response by all levels of government identified the following key shortcomings: * Near total failure in regional communications created problems with agency coordination and response logistics. * Government agencies were not adequately staffed with personnel who had experience or skills in complex logistics operations. * Near non-existent integration between state and federal logistics systems encouraged state and local response officials to abandon the established plans and procedures for requesting and managing critical supplies and resources. * Critical supplies, resources and assets were not effectively prepositioned to support the required response. * Planning for the handling and distribution of donations was insufficient. * Procurement delays, due to bureaucratic requirements at all levels of government and the lack of purchasing agreements with suppliers. * Asset visibility was almost totally obstructed throughout all points in emergency supply chains. To address these shortcomings, in 2008 the NY-NJ-CT-PA Regional Catastrophic Planning Team received funding for the creation of the Regional Logistics Program as a competitive, high-value project awarded through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant Program. The investment justification submitted to the department highlighted the need to address the failures of the Hurricane Katrina response, noting the unprecedented and massive scale of operations that would be required by the nation (United States) if a catastrophe similar to Katrina were to befall the NY-NJ-CT-PA project site, which includes a population of over 22,000,000, or 1 out of 14 residents in the United States. The project described the development of a set of operational components, plans and tools to represent \\"the future of emergency logistics planning in the U.S.\\"  Strategies, Components and Tools  As the project has evolved and the Regional Logistics Program has made its work available for widespread use, these operational components, plans and tools have been assembled into a Universal Logistics Standard that can be specifically implemented within the NY-NJ-CT-PA project site and promoted through the United States as a standardized approach for managing emergency logistics that can be adopted by emergency management agencies at all levels of government. It consists of plans and guides on strategies, components and tactical tools that enable disaster logisticians to plan and execute operations with common tactics. Specifically, its components and tactical tools revolve around three primary strategies: * Resource Management * Movement Control * Distribution Management To date, four components are available to emergency management agencies to support these strategies: * Logistics Centers, which supplement emergency management agencies with an operation to receive resource requests and conduct resource management or movement control strategies specifically needed for an incident response. * Area Logistics Emergency Response Teams, which provide emergency management agencies with trained logisticians to support complex logistics operations needed for an incident response. * Receiving and Distribution Centers, which are just-in-time operations that function to manage incoming shipments of critical commodities, supplies and resources as they arrive into an impacted area and are assigned to meet specific operational needs during a response. * Commodity Point of Distributions, which are independent operations to distribute food, water and critical supplies to the general public. A number of tactical tools have been designed to assist with implementation of the Universal Logistics Standard in areas such as volunteer and donation management, credentialing, pre-scripted mission requests, logistics information management and database systems, field movement visibility and private sector integration.

Society has operated as a mutual company since 1915 and has experienced significant growth in the last 10 years, increasing the policyholders' surplus from roughly $50 million in 2002 to $93 million in 2011. The company‚Äôs more than 250 employees and network of more than 350 independent agencies currently serves customers in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Wisconsin. In 2011, direct written premiums hit $141.5 million and total assets rose to nearly $303 million, both company records.  Summary  Society Insurance specializes in workers compensation, commercial property and casualty, and commercial auto insurance. The company serves businesses ranging from taverns and restaurants to supermarkets, contractors, automobile repair shops, hotels, and medical clinics. Society is known for its close relationships with industry trade associations such as the Wisconsin Restaurant Association, the Tavern League of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Grocers Association, the Wisconsin Medical Society, the Iowa Restaurant Association, the Iowa Lodging Association, the Indiana Restaurant Association, and the Indiana Hotel & Lodging Association. The company offers special benefits such as extended coverages and dividends to members of each of these associations. Rating agency A.M. Best assigned Society Insurance an A- rating for 2012 and also placed the company in Category VII for financial size ($50‚Äì$100 million). Despite not officially doing business in these states, the company is also currently licensed in Michigan, Minnesota and Missouri.  History  In 1911, the Wisconsin legislature passed the state‚Äôs first workers compensation law. Like all other industries, farmers‚Äô threshing crews were required to carry the coverage. However, insurance carriers were not willing to provide the coverage at a reasonable rate. In response to that difficulty in purchasing workers compensation insurance for themselves, a collection of farm threshing crews formed what is now Society Insurance as Wisconsin Brotherhood of Threshermen Insurance Company, Limited Mutual, on June 8, 1915, in Madison, Wisconsin. The company moved to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, in 1918 and also declared its first policy surplus of $301.69 that year. In 1930, the company purchased Threshermen‚Äôs National Insurance Company, a Madison-area competitor. Over the next 50 years, Threshermen‚Äôs moved beyond threshing crews and continued to grow as a multi-purpose workers compensation company. In the early 1980s, what was still Threshermen‚Äôs began offering property and casualty insurance to businesses. The company became a servicing carrier for the Wisconsin Workers Compensation Insurance Pool in 1987, a role it continues in to this day. The company changed its name from Threshermen‚Äôs to Society Insurance in 1995 and expanded into Illinois, Indiana and Iowa in 1996 and 1997. Jim Thomas became president and chief executive officer in January 2004, succeeding Michael Wagner. The company's surplus grew to $65.6 million in 2005, up from $52.3 million in 2004. In 2008, the company saw written premiums grow to $126.2 million, an increase of 6.7 percent over the prior year. The company's surplus hit $86.7 million at year-end. Since becoming Society Insurance, the company has placed an even greater focus on its niche insurance capabilities to the hospitality industry and is widely known for its \\"Uncommon Insurance\\" and \\"Uncommon Value\\" marketing monikers.

Formed by members of the Venus Band, Walias backed up many prominent singers with a hard polyrhythmic funk sound influenced by western artists like King Curtis, Junior Walker and Maceo Parker. In 1977 they recorded one of the few albums of Ethiopian instrumental music in collaboration with vibraphonist Mulatu Astatke, whose role as a bandleader and composer was also a major influence on Ethiopian popular music. History Walias formed in the early 1970s in Addis Ababa where they were the house band for the upscale Hilton Hotel. A civilian curfew made it dangerous for clientele visiting the hotel lounge to leave after 11:00 PM, and Walias would end up playing two or three sets until 6:00 AM the next day. In 1981 Walias became the first modern Ethiopian band to travel to the United States, playing on a tour with singer Mahmoud Ahmed primarily to audiences of Ethiopian refugees. Rather than returning to Ethiopia under its dictatorship, four members of Walias‚ÄîGirma B√®y√®n√®, Mog√®s Habt√©, M√®lak√® G√®br√® and Hailu Mergia‚Äîstayed in the U.S. and formed a new group called Zula Band. Mergia took work in Washington DC driving a taxi cab, often practicing in his cab while waiting for fares at the airport, and released solo cassette tapes of traditional Ethiopian music played on analog synthesizer, electric piano and accordion. Meanwhile the members of Walias who returned to Ethiopia‚ÄîYohannes T√®kola and T√®mar√® Har√®gou‚Äîcontinued to play together under the Derg dictatorship for another decade. In the late 1990s Walias Band found a wider audience in the west when the French label Buda Records reissued much of the group's music on the Ethiopiques series of compact discs. Their instrumental, \\"Musicawi Silt\\", became a popular dance number and has been covered by a number of artists. Not much else of Walias' music was known until African music cassette collector Brian Shimkovitz found a Walias Band tape while traveling in Ethiopia. After hearing it, Shimkovitz found keyboardist Hailu Mergia's phone number on the Internet, called him up, and arranged an official re-release of Walias Band's music. Name The Walias Band's name derives from the walia ibex, an endangered species of the Capra genus native to the mountains of Ethiopia. They share no members with the similarly named Ibex Band who also backed up Mahmoud Ahmed during the same epoch.

In 2009 the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science designated Introdans part of the basic national infrastructure. History The company was founded in 1971 by Ton Wiggers, a former dancer, with a few friends who met in his living room in Arnhem. At first the small company produced classical ballet pieces choreographed by Wiggers. The company gradually became known, first touring in the Netherlands and then in 1993 making its international debut. Since then Introdans has traveled widely. For example, it was the first company to perform on the new stage of the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Russia. In 2001 and 2005 it appeared on Broadway, New York, in 2006 at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2008 at the National Opera in Tallinn, Estonia and in 2011 at the Shanghai Centre Theater in Shanghai, China. Princess Margriet of the Netherlands became the Company‚Äôs patroness. The company was the subject of a documentary \\"Recognition at Last\\" that was aired on Dutch TV in 2011. Education Adriaan Luteijn is the artistic manager of Introdans Education, which runs a program called \\"Introdans Interactive\\". This involves interactive workshops that teach young people to participate creatively in dance, classes and performances of integrated and disability dance, and youth performances. In 2008 he was guest speaker at the Ukukhua Komdanso Youth Dance Festival in Durban, South Africa, and this led to a relationship with the Flatfoot Dance Company in which Introdans and Flatfoot visited each other, shared classes and workshops and put on a joint performance in Arnhem in 2010. Recent tours Introdans returned to the United States to appear on 1 May 2012 at the Joyce Theater in New York City with a show named Heavenly. The show consisted of three very different works: the energetic Messiah with choreography by Ed Wubbe and music by George Frideric Handel; the lyrical F√ºnf Gedichte (five songs) by Nils Christe with music by Richard Wagner; and the chaotic but organized hip-hop Paradise? choreographed by Gisela Rocha of Brazil. The show got lukewarm reviews. One critic said of the show: \\"This is choreography made to slide in and out of the mind. Even never having seen it, you know all too well where it is going\\". Another said \\"The dancers are attractive and highly skilled, if also generic, and the same goes for the choreography\\".

Life  Henry II was born posthumously, as the only son of Henry XVI of Reuss-Gera (1530-1572), the founder of the Younger Line, and his wife, Countess Dorothea of Solms-Sonnewalde (1547-1595). Henry successfully promoted education and the economy of his country. In 1608, he founded the Rutheneum Gymnasium in Gera (now the Goethe-Gymnasium/Rutheneum). Against the advice of his theological councillor, he granted asylum to Calvinist refugees from Flanders and housed them in his capital city Gera. This led to an upsurge in wool production and an economic boom. During his reign, Gera also developed into the cultural centre of the Reuss areas. He had a particular fondness for \\"ring riding\\", and was a frequent guest at the courts in Vienna and Dresden. Henry II died on 23 December 1635 and was buried in the Salvator Church in Gera. The composer Heinrich Sch√ºtz wrote his Musikalische Exequien for this occasion. His elaborately decorated copper outer coffin, with biblical proverbs and evangelical chorals, was transferred from the Salvator Church to the St. John church in 1995. In 2011, it was displayed in an exhibition about funeral practices in the early modern age in the city museum of Gera. It has also been on display in the Museum for Sepulchral Culture in Kassel.

It is known as the \\"Navy Restaurant Komatsu\\" and was a preferred eating location for Japanese naval officers prior to, and following, the Second World War; American Navy personnel and those related to the Japanese navy have also patronized the establishment in significant numbers. On May 16, 2016, Komatsu restaurant caught fire. The smoke spewing from the inferno engulfed nearby buildings downwind of Komatsu, plunging them into darkness and forcing the residents of the nearby buildings to be evacuated. History A waiting room in Komatsu. Komatsu was started by Komatsu Yamamoto on 8 August 1885, which was the eighth month and eighth day of the year of Meiji 18, a date that accorded with the Japanese preference for the lucky numbers \\"8, 8, 8\\".Asada [1996:108‚Äì109] The building site is in a convenient location where people during the late- nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries could easily eat a Japanese dinner after swimming in the sea. During that era, Japan was expanding its Navy. Under the direction of the Navy Minister, the Naval headquarters, Chinjufu, was occupied with planning and practice for its fleet, recruiting of sailors, overall management, and supervision of the Navy. In line with the expanding Imperial Navy, Komatsu continued to develop, and it was called \\"Pine\\" (Matsu is \\"pine\\" in English).Toyama [1983:1] Gradually, the restaurant lost its locational advantage due to a land reclamation process in 1913, and it was no longer a place of white sand and green pine trees. Additionally, due to World War I and strikes for the improvement of female work conditions, Komatsu was forced to close between 1918 and 1919.Yokosuka City [2009:287‚Äì288] In 1923, the Restaurant Komatsu was built again in a location that overlooked the sea in Yonegahama,Yokosuka City [2009:288] and, at the request of Shigeyoshi Inoue, a South Pacific location of Pine was opened on one of the Chuuk islands between 1942 and 1944.Asada [1996:66‚Äì71] Following the defeat of Japan, the restaurant became an office for the settlement of remaining affairs of the Navy and a hotel for interpreters, and in October 1945, it was designated as a restaurant for American military personnel.Toyama [1983:286‚Äì288] Since Japan's independence in 1952, Restaurant Komatsu has been widely used, not only by American Navy personnel, but also by Japanese men related to the Navy in some manner. It is the only Japanese restaurant that was operational during both World Wars. , the restaurant is housed in a typical Japanese building from the Sh≈çwa period, and has retained various historical documents, such as the calligraphies of T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç, Isoroku Yamamoto, and Mitsumasa Yonai, famous Japanese Naval admirals.Yokosuka City [2009:288] Komatsu Yamamoto and the origin of Komatsu Prince Komatsu Akihito, who gave his name to the mistress of the Japanese restaurant The mistress of the restaurant was Komatsu Yamamoto, whose former name was Etsu Yamamoto. She was born in 1849 at Koishigawa Sekiguchi Suid≈çcho as the fourth daughter of a grocer in Edo. Yamamoto began working at a small inn‚Äìrestaurant called Yoshikawaya in Uraga, a small harbor town that was also a Navy town.Toyama [1983:13‚Äì16] Whilst working in Uraga, she became friends with admirals and naval officers.Toyama [1983:24‚Äì26] In 1875, Prince Komatsu Akihito, Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa, Prince Fushimi Sadanaru and Prince Yamashina Akira visited Uraga for the inspection of the shooting of torpedoes. They were followed by General Akiyoshi Yamada, Yamagata Aritomo and Saigo Tsugumichi. The princes hoped that the naval officers would stay at Yoshikawaya due to the view that it offered, but the officers had been allocated other accommodation beforehand.Asada [1996:126] During the first night in Uraga, the princes competed in a thumb wrestling match with the mistress, the latter winning overwhelmingly. Prince Komatsu divulged to Yamamoto that he envied her body and strength, in addition to an assertion that he would endow her with a name. On the following day, the princes ordered a formal change of Etsu's name to Komatsu; this is the origin of the name, Yamamoto Komatsu (in kana).Asada [1996:126‚Äì129] Yamamoto made a decision to be an independent woman following the advice of people connected to the Navy and her restaurant was opened on 8 August 1885, along the Tado seashore,Asada [1996:108‚Äì109] later relocating near the Shotokuji-Sakashita bus stop. Taisho Era In 1913, the seashore of Tado was changed into land (land reclamation) and there was no privileged scenery.Yokosuka City [2009:287] The crisis after World War I decreased the number of customers, and Restaurant Komatsu had to be closed in 1918 and 1919. Komatsu Yamamoto concentrated her work as the mistress of Yamatoya, a geisha house in Yokosuka.Asada [1996:153] Since many navy officers deplored the closure of Komatsu, she bought 400 tsubos of land in Yonegahama and started the reconstruction of Komatsu in 1923. Fortunately, the effects of the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake were slight and it was completed in November. The total area of the reconstructed Komatsu was 175 tsubos; there were seven rooms on the first floor and three rooms on the second floor.Asada [1996:153] Naoe Yamamoto, the second mistress New building since 1934. In 1924, Komatsu Yamamoto, who had remained single during her life, adopted her grandniece Naoe Goto, who was 15 years old, and changed her name to Naoe Yamamoto. In 1927, at age 18, she was wed to Koji Kirigatani, a son of a timber trader,Asada [1996:151‚Äì156] and assumed management of the restaurant; she became its second mistress and supported it well into the Heisei age. Admiral's Room Admiral's Room From 1933 to 1934, a new wing of the house was constructed on the previous site of the garden: a Western reception room and seven Japanese- style rooms. One of the users of the reception room was Isoroku Yamamoto. , this room is a museum with historic materials related to the Japanese navy.Yokosuka City [2009:288] Seven Japanese-style rooms are composed of various woods such as Paulownia tomentosa, rosewood, Chamaecyparis obtusa, maple and pseudocydonia. The Momiji (Japanese maple) and the Koyo Autumn leaf color Rooms are top-grade (chokan), and were used by various admirals such as Isoroku Yamamoto.Toyama [1983:188‚Äì190] In the second floor of the new wing is a large room as large as 160 mats. Komatsu Yamamoto, the first mistress, used to appear in Japanese-style parties until she was 88 in 1935. She was given a gala 88th year birthday party. Then, she retired and died at age 94 in 1943.Mogami [1960:3‚Äì4] References  Bibliography  *Asada Tsuyoshi, Story of Navy Restaurant Komatsu 1996, Kanashin Shuppan, *Mogami Akinori, A Life Story of Komatsu Yamamoto 1960 *Toyama Saburo, Ikari to Pain (Anchor (Navy) and Restaurant Komatsu) 1983, Seizansha *Yokosuka City, New History of Yokosuka City, Suffix; Cultural Heritage 2009, Yokosuka City Category:Yokosuka Category:Restaurants in Japan Category:Imperial Japanese Navy Category:Naval history of Japan ","title":"Komatsu (Japanese restaurant)"},{"id":"35717756","text":"Pogonistes is a genus of beetles in the family Carabidae, containing the following species: * Pogonistes angustus (Gebler, 1829) * Pogonistes chinensis Habu, 1986 * Pogonistes convexicollis Chaudoir, 1871 * Pogonistes gracilis Dejean, 1828 * Pogonistes grinevi Lutshnik, 1935 * Pogonistes liliputanus Apfelbeck, 1904 * Pogonistes rufoaeneus Dejean, 1828 * Pogonistes testaceus Dejean, 1828 References Category:Trechinae ","title":"Pogonistes"},{"id":"35717760","text":"Pogonopsis pallida is a species of beetle in the family Carabidae, the only species in the genus Pogonopsis.

The mountain also has a rich bird life, with many birds of prey such as the common kestrel, the Eurasian sparrowhawk and the long-eared owl. Besides more common mammals, Hoverberget is also home to Eurasian lynx. The tourist attraction called the Hoverberg Cave (Hoverbergsgrottan) is deep, and is the largest rock cave in Scandinavia.

Mermall's studies focused primarily on modern Spanish literature and thought, primarily the developments after the Spanish Civil War, including analyses and commentaries on the works of Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, Unamuno, Pedro La√≠n Entralgo, Juan Rof Carballo and Francisco Ayala, as well as comments on the importance of the essay in Spanish literature. Biography Thomas MermallBased in large part on Thomas Mermall‚Äôs autobiographical article \\"La otra cara del destino\\", FronteraD Revista Digital and the obituary published in El Pa√≠s, (September 25, 2011), ‚ÄúThomas Mermall, un hispanista en el exilio‚Äù . was a Hispanist born to a Jewish family in the town of Uzhhorod in the Carpathian Ruthenia of Eastern Europe, a town that is today the administrative enter of Zakarpattia Oblast in the Ukraine. At the time of his birth the town was part of Czechoslovakia, although it was transferred to Hungary the following year.See Twentieth century history of Uzhhorod in wikipedia. His family spoke Hungarian at home and Ruthenian with the neighbors, some of whom also spoke Yiddish. Mermall would study Czech and Russian at school before leaving Europe and eventually adding Spanish, English and a bit of Hebrew to his linguistic experience. When the Nazis reached Uzhhorod in the spring of 1944, Mermall‚Äôs father, Gabriel,Gabor Mermelstain changed his name to Gabriel Mermall in the US. See Mu√±oz Molina, Antonio, \\"Pasados interactivos\\" . El Pa√≠s, October 10, 2009. hoping to save his wife and child, returned from the Russian front where he had been part of a Hungarian motorized army unit. Mermall‚Äôs mother was too sick to travel, but he and his father fled into the forest where they were helped by a series of local residents until settling into a hayloft which housed a detachment of cavalry from the collaborationist Hungarian government, something which created a constant danger for them. Mermall‚Äôs mother was deported to Auschwitz where she died a few days after her family‚Äôs flight from the city. However, by what Mermall referred to as ‚Äúthe flip side of destiny‚Äù given the odds against his survival, he and his father were freed in November 1944 by the arrival of the Red Army. Thomas Mermall, it turned out, had been the only Jewish child in the entire region to have survived. During their time in hiding Mermall‚Äôs father kept a diary, a diary he would later turn into an account of that experience and publish as ‚ÄúSeeds of Grace‚Äù in the book By the Grace of Strangers: Two Boys‚Äô Rescue During the Holocaust.Mermall, Gabriel and Norbert Yasharoff. By the Grace of Strangers: Two Boys‚Äô Rescue During the Holocaust. Holocaust Survivors Memoirs Project, 2006. Steven Spielberg purchased the film rights to the story, although the project was never carried out. In 1947 Thomas Mermall and his father managed to leave Europe and settle in Chile for three years before moving to the United States where his father‚Äôs brother lived. Mermall completed his studies in the US and became a naturalized citizen. He went on to become a full professor of Spanish Literature at Brooklyn College and formed part of the doctoral program of the City University of New York. Mermall‚Äôs published works have included studies of Unamuno, Octavio Paz, Pedro La√≠n Entralgo, Juan Rof Carballo and Francisco Ayala. Mermall also produced a critical edition of Ortega y Gasset‚Äôs The revolt of the masses and published his own memoirs, also entitled Seeds of Grace [Semillas de la Gracia].

He is best known for his appearances in Tahrir Square in Cairo during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Ramy is one of the few singers in Middle East to sing hard rock. In 2011, Ramy was considered the voice of the Egyptian revolution. During the height of the uprising, Ramy performed in front of millions of people in the Tahrir Square. His song Irhal, in which then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak was urged to resign, gained popularity among the demonstrators. It became internationally known through YouTube, and is referred to as the anthem of the revolution. In 2011, it was selected by Time Out as the third- most world-changing song of all time. His 2018 song Balaha led to six individuals being arrested in Egypt that were, either correctly or incorrectly, assumed to be connected to Ramy and the song. Among them were the writer of the song, but also a former band member that had not worked on the record. According to Weka Soliman also a former band member and current guitarist for Canadian rock band Special Ops, he had escaped Egypt after the release of the song in fear of detention. On May 2020 Shady Habash one of the detainees died After being incarcerated for more than two years in pretrial detention. Egypt‚Äôs public prosecutor has said he mistakenly drunk hand sanitiser in his cell, thinking it was water. Ramy's songs were banned in Egypt and he was unable to perform public shows.

Her initial religious profession was made on 7 May 1920. In 1923 she decided to found a convent in Getafe at the Cerro de los Angeles near the monument erected in the geographical center of Spain. The Bishop of Madrid was enthusiastic about the idea and on 19 May 1924 she and three nuns of El Escorial settled for a brief period of time in a house at Getafe while awaiting the building of a convent. On 30 May 1924 she made her solemn profession there at El Escorial and in June 1926 was appointed as the prioress of the convent of El Cerro in Madrid which opened on 31 October 1926. On 15 September 1932 the Indian Bishop of Vijayapuram asked her to found a Carmelite convent and on 11 September 1933 eight nuns went there to establish it. She herself would have gone but her superiors did not allow for her to leave. The religious persecution that started in 1931 saw her spend countless hours each night in reflection and both requested and obtained permission from Pope Pius XI for them to leave their group in order to give up their lives if the time came to defend the sacred image should it be violated. On 1 May 1936 an armed band tried to attack the convent by scaling the walls and the Communist mayor warned her (she received him in the parlor) that she and the others should flee lest something terrible happen to them. On 22 July 1936 the nuns were expelled from their convent and were welcomed by the Ursulines in Getafe where the Carmelites were monitored under house arrest. She then fled to an apartment on Calle Claudio Coello in Madrid where she spent fourteen months. In September 1937 she was able to leave Madrid with her group and - going through to Lourdes in France (arriving there on 16 September 1937) - later re- entered Spain to settle in Las Batuecas in Salamanca on 28 September 1937 which had been purchased before the war. There - at the request of the Bishop of Coria-C√°ceres - she founded a new convent. In March 1939 she returned to the Cerro de los Angeles to restore the convent there and would go on to found houses at Toledo in 1960 and at M√°laga in 1964. The nun founded several convents which included one at Mancera de Abajo in Salamanca in 1944 and in Duruelo at √Åvila in 1947 as well as at Arenas de San Pedro in Avila in 1954 and at San Calixto in the Cordoba mountains in 1956. One was also founded at Aravaca in Madrid in 1958 and at La Aldehuela in Madrid in 1961 where she was elected as the prioress and lived there until her death. She also founded a convent in Kottayam in India in 1933. In 1972 she founded the \\"Association of Saint Teresa\\". She was confined to her bed for rest after suffering from a bout of pneumonia on Good Friday in 1967. Mother Maravillas died on 11 December 1974 at her convent and her remains are interred at La Aldehuela. Her final words were: \\"What happiness to die a Carmelite!\\" She had suffered a heart attack on 7 November 1962 and suffered another on 27 October 1972 which left her in a weakened condition until her death and she had received the Anointing of the Sick and her last Communion on 8 December 1974. Sainthood The beatification process opened on 19 June 1980 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause and titled her as a Servant of God while the cognitional process in Madrid spanned from 1981 until 1983 before the C.C.S. validated this process in Rome on 5 October 1984. The postulation - a decade later in 1994 - then sent the Positio dossier to Rome for assessment. The theologians assessed and approved the cause on 24 May 1996 as did the C.C.S. on 1 October 1996 while this allowed for Pope John Paul II to confirm that she led a life of heroic virtue in a move that saw him name her as Venerable on 17 December 1996. The process for a miracle needed for her beatification opened in Spain and lasted in the diocese of its origin from 15 February 1984 until its closure on 13 April 1984; the C.C.S. later validated this process on 5 October 1984. The medical board issued their assent to this miracle on 24 April 1997 while theologians also approved it later on 30 September 1997; the C.C.S. did likewise on 16 December 1997. John Paul II approved the healing to be a legitimate miracle on 18 December 1997 and beatified Mother Maravillas on 10 May 1998 in Saint Peter's Square. The process for the second miracle - the one for full sainthood - opened and closed in Argentina and received validation on 21 January 2000 before receiving the approval of the medical board on 10 May 2001; theologians also approved it on 27 November 2001 as did the C.C.S. on 5 February 2002. John Paul II approved this miracle on 23 April 2002 and canonized Maravillas on his apostolic visit to Spain in Columbus Plaza in Madrid on 4 May 2003.

The method was first proposed in the 1950s by Louis Landweber, and it can be now viewed as a special case of many other more general methods.  Basic algorithm  The original Landweber algorithm attempts to recover a signal x from (noisy) measurements y. The linear version assumes that y = Ax for a linear operator A. When the problem is in finite dimensions, A is just a matrix. When A is nonsingular, then an explicit solution is x = A^{-1} y. However, if A is ill-conditioned, the explicit solution is a poor choice since it is sensitive to any noise in the data y. If A is singular, this explicit solution doesn't even exist. The Landweber algorithm is an attempt to regularize the problem, and is one of the alternatives to Tikhonov regularization. We may view the Landweber algorithm as solving: : \\\\min_x \\\\Ax-y\\\\_2^2/2 using an iterative method. The algorithm is given by the update : x_{k+1} = x_{k} - \\\\omega A^*(Ax_k - y). where the relaxation factor \\\\omega satisfies 0 < \\\\omega < 2/\\\\sigma_1^2. Here \\\\sigma_1 is the largest singular value of A. If we write f(x) = \\\\Ax-y\\\\_2^2 /2, then the update can be written in terms of the gradient : x_{k+1} = x_k - \\\\omega abla f(x_k) and hence the algorithm is a special case of gradient descent. For ill-posed problems, the iterative method needs to be stopped at a suitable iteration index, because it semi-converges. This means that the iterates approach a regularized solution during the first iterations, but become unstable in further iterations. The reciprocal of the iteration index 1/k acts as a regularization parameter. A suitable parameter is found, when the mismatch \\\\Ax_k-y\\\\_2^2 approaches the noise level. Using the Landweber iteration as a regularization algorithm has been discussed in the literature.Louis, A.K. (1989): Inverse und schlecht gestellte Probleme. Stuttgart, TeubnerVainikko, G.M., Veretennikov, A.Y. (1986): Iteration Procedures in Ill-Posed Problems. Moscow, Nauka (in Russian)  Nonlinear extension  In general, the updates generated by x_{k+1} = x_{k} - \\\\tau abla f(x_k) will generate a sequence f(x_k) that converges to a minimizer of f whenever f is convex and the stepsize \\\\tau is chosen such that 0 < \\\\tau < 2/( \\\\ abla f\\\\^2 ) where \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\ is the spectral norm. Since this is special type of gradient descent, there currently is not much benefit to analyzing it on its own as the nonlinear Landweber, but such analysis was performed historically by many communities not aware of unifying frameworks. The nonlinear Landweber problem has been studied in many papers in many communities; see, for example,.A convergence analysis of the Landweber iteration for nonlinear ill-posed problems Martin Hanke, Andreas Neubauer and Otmar Scherzer. NUMERISCHE MATHEMATIK Volume 72, Number 1 (1995), 21-37,  Extension to constrained problems  If f is a convex function and C is a convex set, then the problem : \\\\min_{x \\\\in C} f(x) can be solved by the constrained, nonlinear Landweber iteration, given by: : x_{k+1} = \\\\mathcal{P}_C( x_{k} - \\\\tau abla f(x_k) ) where \\\\mathcal{P} is the projection onto the set C. Convergence is guaranteed when 0 < \\\\tau < 2/( \\\\A\\\\^2 ) .Eicke, B.: Iteration methods for convexly constrained ill-posed problems in Hilbert space. Numer. Funct. Anal. Optim. 13, 413‚Äì429 (1992) This is again a special case of projected gradient descent (which is a special case of the forward‚Äìbackward algorithm) as discussed in.  Applications  Since the method has been around since the 1950s, it has been adopted and rediscovered by many scientific communities, especially those studying ill- posed problems. In X-ray computed tomography it is called SIRT - simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique. It has also been used in the computer vision community Johansson, B., Elfving, T., Kozlovc, V., Censor, Y., Forssen, P.E., Granlund, G.; \\"The application of an oblique-projected Landweber method to a model of supervised learning\\", Math. Comput. Modelling, vol 43, pp 892‚Äì909 (2006) and the signal restoration community.Trussell, H.J., Civanlar, M.R.: The Landweber iteration and projection onto convex sets. IEEE Trans. Acoust., Speech, Signal Process. 33, 1632‚Äì1634 (1985) It is also used in image processing, since many image problems, such as deconvolution, are ill-posed. Variants of this method have been used also in sparse approximation problems and compressed sensing settings.  References  Landweber, L.

In the mid-1730s, the family moved to √Öbo in present-day Finland, as the father received a position as secretary at the appeals court (hovr√§tt) there. Martin was enrolled at Royal Academy of √Öbo in 1745, where he spent time as musician and a music teacher, while at the same time doing botanical excursions and discovering several plants previously unknown in Finland. He worked as a tutor in Stockholm 1753-1756. After coming into contact with Pehr Wargentin, the permanent secretary of Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and presenting some papers to the academy, he was enrolled as an apprentice student at the academy in 1756. He also enrolled at Uppsala University 1756, and received a bachelor's degree in medicine in Uppsala 1761. In Uppsala, Carl Linnaeus was teaching, and he was sufficiently impressed with Martin to select him to travel with a whaling ship to collect specimen from the Arctic region and become a pioneering Arctic researcher. In April 1758, Martin left Gothenburg on a whaling ship belonging to the Swedish Greenland Company. The three-month trip went as far north as the 80th parallel, encountered difficult weather conditions, and Martin was only ashore for a few hours, on some small islands to the west of Spitsbergen. The trip did however produce valuable weather observations, and collections of sea- living animals and birds. In 1760, he did a trip to Norway's west coast, and did collections of sea-living animals using Bergen as a base. He also studied causes of leper and migrations of herring. In 1761, after his degree in medicine, he moved to Stockholm intending to finish his education and at the same time practice as a physician. In the autumn he became ill, and after months of pain he was forced have his right leg amputated after it had been attacked by gangrene. He thereafter abandoned his plans for a higher degree, and in 1763 went to Finland, where he lived on small means in different cities but from 1770 in √Öbo, receiving some financial support from friends. He continued to make scientific observations and experiments, in particular relating to physiology.

He was a professor or theology at Erlangen, where he had studied, and then in 1893 a Professor of dogmatic theology at Friedrich Wilhelm University (founded as the University of Berlin in 1810). A staunch German nationalist, Seeberg affirmed the divinely appointed role of Germany in the salvation of the world, and did not support the Weimar Republic in Germany. Seeberg was part of the movement for the modern revival of Luther and Reformation studies, including the repositioning of Martin Bucer as a mediating theologian between Lutheran and Reformed thought.Lugioyo, Brian. \\"Martin Bucer's Doctrine of Justification: Reformation Theology and Early Modern Irenicism.\\" Oxford University Press, Jul 9, 2010, pp. 7-9, 44. His son, , became a significant theologian in his own right at the University of Berlin. His brother, , was also a theologian. Scholarship and influence Seeberg authored over two dozen books and many articles, covering a range of issues in historical theology, including early Christianity, Luther, the essence of Christianity, and Duns Scotus. His most famous text was the widely published and translated Textbook of the History of Doctrines.Seeberg, Reinhold, \\"Lehrbuch des Dogmengeschicte, Erlangen\\"; A. Deichert (G. B√∂hme), 1895-1898. English translation \\"Textbook of the History of Doctrines,\\" trans. Charles E. Hay, Philadelphia: Lutheran Publication Society, 1905. in five volumes. The latter work offered an encyclopedic understanding of the development of Christian doctrine, from the New Testament period into the 17th century, according to modern historical-critical methods. In it, Seeberg offers a more traditional assessment of the essentials of Christian teachings, in contrast to his colleague Adolph von Harnack, the elder historian of dogma at Berlin. Seeberg also emphasized the social nature of the Church, a teaching which became important to his students.Mattes, Mark. \\"Twentieth Century Lutheran Theologians,\\" Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2013, pp. 57, 97, 125, 156. Seeberg had several important students, including Werner Elert in church history and dogma, Hermann Sasse in Lutheran studies, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer in theology and ethics. Bonhoeffer adopted Seeberg's emphasis on the social nature of the Church, the epistemological and ethical dimensions of doctrines, and an anti-metaphysical emphasis in his own thought.Bethge, Eberhard. \\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer: A Biography\\". New York: Harper and Row, 1970, pp. 56-68. Even when Bonhoeffer turned to a stronger Barthian view of revelation over religion, Bonhoeffer maintained a social emphasis in theology and ethics, which marked Seeberg's lasting influence.

One of the first adopters of Charles Darwin in Russia, he is most notable for his early work on the evolution of the Hippomorpha family. Brother of Alexander Kovalevsky. He married Sofia Kovalevskaya, and had a daughter named Sofia, nicknamed 'Fufa'. After spending some years together as a couple, Vladimir, financially ruined, a victim of depression and unable to support his wife and daughter, committed suicide.  Early life  Vladimir Kovalevsky was born in Vitebsk providence, outside of Palibino, the youngest of two children. His father, Onufry Osipovich Kovalevsky, was a Russianized Polish landowner and his mother, Polina Petrovna, was Russian. He spent his entire childhood at the estate, and was tutored until the age of 16. He had a grounding in foreign languages, and during his last year at Imperial School of Jurisprudence he earned money by translating books. After graduating in 1861, he gained employment at the Department of Heraldry but asked to travel abroad for his health. After traveling to Heidelberg, T√ºbingen, Paris, and Nice, he settled in London where he taught the daughter of exiled radical Alexander Herzen. This attracted the attention of the agents of the tzar. When he returned home, he published many scientific texts and, in 1866, Herzen's \\"Who is to Blame\\" of which the entire printing was burned by order of the censors. After his engagement to a young radical woman was broken, he met Sofia Kovalevskaya (n√©e Korvin-Krukovskaya) and the two were \\"fictitiously\\" married 27 September 1868.  Importance of work  Kovalevsky edited many scientific books, and on 27 February 1867 he wrote to Charles Darwin about translating his latest book, The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication. His translation work was so fast that the Russian copy of Variation was published several months before the \\"original\\" English version. He also translated The Descent of Man, which he and Sofia had to carry through Prussian lines into besieged Paris during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. In his lifetime, his only original work was his thesis, On the Osteology of the Hyopotamidae, in which he \\"documented the most famous evolutionary story of all\\", the transformation of a small ancestor with many toes into the large, single-toed modern horse. He also identified the primary basis for this transformation, which was a shift in their environment from eating leaves in the woodlands and marshes to grazing grass on the open plains.  Return to Russia and suicide  Kovalevsky returned with his wife to Russia by 1878, with the hopes of becoming a professor of paleontology, which he was unable to attain in Europe. In October, they had a child by the name of Sofya, who they called \\"Foufie\\". However, the teaching job did not come through. Kovalevsky subsequently entered a bad business situation which led to his disgrace. Humiliated, Kovalevsky committed suicide on 15 April 1883.

From 1898 until 1912 he lectured at the University of Zurich and other Swiss institutions, later lecturing at the University of Vienna and from 1914 at the University of Munich. =Opposition to German Militarism and persecution by the Nazis= Foerster was strongly opposed to the German foreign policy in the era of the First World War, particularly the militaristic attitudes of the ruling elite in Germany. These views made him an exception to the prevailing nationalist tendencies in the German Empire, and due to this and his ethical views he was regularly attacked from nationalist circles. His criticism of the political legacy of Otto von Bismarck during the war caused a great scandal at his university, and he was dismissed from his post for two semesters. During this time, he returned to Switzerland, where he focused his efforts on the question of to what extent Germany was responsible for the First World War. Foerster became convinced that Germany had blocked the success of the Hague Conventions in 1907, and had thereby isolated itself internationally and drawn a course for war. When Foerster returned from Switzerland in 1917, he remained convinced that responsibility for the World War lay with the ruling elite in Germany, and particularly with the leaders of the military.Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster (1869-1966) : Ein Inspirator der katholischen Friedensbewegung in Deutschland by Bruno Hipler, in Stimmen der Zeit, 1990 edition 2, p. 120 His views made him highly unpopular with the conservative factions of German society and he became seen as a key enemy by the newly created national socialist movement. In 1920 he published his book, Mein Kampf gegen das militaristische und nationalistische Deutschland (My struggle against the militaristic and nationalistic Germany). Following this, he received numerous death threats from right-wing radicals. After Matthias Erzberger and later Walther Rathenau were murdered, Foerster was warned to seek refuge. In 1922 he resigned from his teaching position and fled to Switzerland, later settling in France in 1926. As Foerster continued from a distance to warn against growing German nationalism and the rise of national socialism, he became seen by the Nazis as a major intellectual enemy. After the Nazis seized power in 1933, Foersters works were among those publicly burnt in ritualised book burnings held across Germany. At the book burning in Berlin on May 10, 1933, the prescribed \\"fire speech\\" consigned Foerster's writings to the flames with the words Gegen Gesinnungslumperei und politischen Verrat (Against immoral opportunism and political betrayal). Foerster was on the first list of those whose German citizenship was to be revoked, signed on 23. August 1933 by the Reichminister for the interior. Foerster was well-respected in France and received French citizenship. However, after the occupation of France by the Wehrmacht in 1940, Foerster was immediately wanted by the Gestapo. Foerster, who had been living close to the Swiss border in case of this occurrence, fled to Switzerland. The Swiss authorities however refused him asylum, even doubting the legitimacy of his French citizenship and explaining that they considered him to remain a German national. He managed to then flee to Portugal and onwards to the United States. =Post-war= Shortly after the end of the Second World War, Foerster wrote an article in the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung in which he warned of a \\"Prussianisation\\" of the entire world, if the Germans didn't come to \\"recognition of their horrible guilt\\" for the crimes committed during the Nazi era and make amends by contributing to the rebuilding of \\"the noble values of humanity\\". His memoirs appeared in 1953 under the title Erlebte Weltgeschichte, 1869-1953 (Experienced World History, 1869-1953). He lived until 1963 in New York City, before returning to Switzerland to spend the last few years of his life in Kilchberg near Zurich.

Early life He was born in Paris, and abandoned by his mother soon after birth. His father, Firmin L√©autaud, who begrudgingly brought him up, was a prompter at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, and because of him Paul first became familiar with the world of the theater. As others viewed him According to Nancy Mitford in The Letters of Nancy Mitford and Evelyn Waugh (p. 251), Leautaud was an eccentric literary critic and diarist who said he loved cats and dogs more than people, lived on nothing but potatoes and cheese for eight years, and never travelled further than Calais. Mavis Gallant described him in her Paris Notebooks (Toronto: Stoddart, 1988):All of these quotes come from the March 28, 2012 entry on the blog Andrew Rickard: Quotations, Translations, and Timonism. :He was mean, slanderous, and cruel; he could also display generosity and great delicacy in his judgments. Even at his most caustic there was a simplicity, an absence of vanity, rare in a writer. He talked about death and love, authors and actors, Paris and poetry, without rambling, without moralizing, without a trace of bitterness for having fallen on hard times. He was sustained, without knowing it, by the French refusal to accept poverty as a sign of failure in an artist. L√©autaud, at rock bottom, still had his credentials. His monumental diary \\"Journal Litt√©raire\\", which he kept for over 50 years, can without exaggeration be described as the greatest study of character ever written. (p. 143) :He would not stand for any form of grandiloquence where writing was concerned, and words such as \\"inspiration\\" were shot down rapidly: \\"When I see my father dying and write about his death I am not inspired, I am describing.\\" Asked why he had been at his dreadful father's deathbed at all, he said, \\"It was only curiosity. Cu-ri-o-si-t√©.\\" (p. 145) :He hated the pompous Com√©die Fran√ßaise delivery and thought nothing of bawling objections in the middle of a classical tirade. If no notice was taken of his protest, he simply went to sleep. When he admired a play he put off writing about it because he wanted to take time and thought. As a result the best productions were never mentioned. Often he wrote about something else entirely (his most quoted non-review is about the death of a dog called Span) with one dismissive sentence for play and author. (p. 146-7) :He had been with Mercure de France for most of his adult life. Only once had he ever thought of going, and that was in 1936, when Georges Duhamel became director and committed several sacrilegious acts: he got rid of the gas lamps and had the offices wired for electric light; he installed one telephone, ordered one typewriter and hired one female secretary. L√©autaud, who preferred candlelight to any other, was bothered by the reforms: \\"Why change something that suits me?\\" (p. 147-8) :During a radio interview he remarked that he had always wanted a pair of checked trousers. A young boy immediately wrote that his father, a tailor, would be glad to make them for nothing. L√©autaud took it as an insult and snapped, on the air, \\"Do these people imagine I go around bare-arsed?\\" (p. 148) :He wanted to say before he died, \\"I regret everything,\\" words, he said, \\"that will sum up my life.\\" The last thing he did say before dying in his sleep was, \\"Foutez-moi la paix,\\" [\\"Leave me the hell alone.\\"] which was more typical. (p. 151) Works The novel Le Petit Ami, published in 1903 by Mercure de France, was the first work of L√©autaud's to appear under his own name. * 1900 : Po√®tes d'Aujourd'hui [1880-1900], morceaux choisis accompagn√©s de notices biographiques et d'un essai de bibliographie,This anthology, originally in only one volume, was reissued in a two-volume revised edition in 1908 and in a three-volume revised edition in 1929. with Adolphe van Bever, Mercure de France : ** Original edition (1900): ::Henri Barbusse - Henri Bataille - Tristan Corbi√®re - Andr√© Fontainas - Paul Fort - Ren√© Ghil - Fernand Gregh - Charles Gu√©rin - Andr√©- Ferdinand H√©rold - Francis Jammes - Gustave Kahn - Jules Laforgue - Raymond de la Tailh√®de - Pierre Lou√øs - Maurice Maeterlinck - Maurice Magre - St√©phane Mallarm√© - Camille Mauclair - Stuart Merrill - Robert de Montesquiou - Jean Mor√©as - Pierre Quillard - Henri de R√©gnier - Adolphe Rett√© - Jean-Arthur RimbaudGraphie du pr√©nom telle qu'imprim√©e dans 2 premi√®res √©ditions. \\\\- Georges Rodenbach - Albert Samain - Emmanuel Signoret - Laurent Tailhade - Paul Val√©ry - √âmile Verhaeren - Paul Verlaine - Francis Viel√©-Griffin ** Poets in the second edition (1908) ::Volume I : Henri Barbusse, Henri Bataille, Tristan Corbi√®re, Lucie Delarue-Mardrus, √âmile Despax, Max Elskamp, Andr√© Fontainas, Paul Fort, Ren√© Ghil, Remy de Gourmont, Fernand Gregh, Charles Gu√©rin, A.-F.

Legum and President Ronald Reagan Jeffrey A. Legum and President Barack Obama - 2012 Minute Honoring Jeffrey A. Legum from The Park School Jeffrey A. Legum and Speaker of House Nancy Pelosi - 2019 Jeffrey Alfred Legum, a philanthropist, investor, and former automobile dealer, was born in Baltimore in 1941. His father, Leslie Legum, was a developer of large industrial parks, and his mother, Naomi Legum, was the daughter of ice cream manufacturer, L. M. Hendler. Proclamation - Jeffrey Alfred Legum Day Legum has been successful as an auto dealer (he owned the largest car and truck dealership in Maryland), and as an investor. His investment advice helped build the endowments of both the Park School and the Baltimore Museum of Art. Early business accomplishments Legum started working in high school at age 16 as a door-to-door salesman for a headache remedy. The company offered him a share of the business, but Legum refused the offer, choosing to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he majored in economics. As a senior at Penn, in an advertising course, he created an ad campaign for Avis car rentals. Avis used his work in one of their campaigns. Park Circle Motor Company Upon graduation from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business with a B.S. degree in economics in 1963, Legum joined Park Circle Motor Company, which was founded in 1921 by Legum's grandfather. In 1967, at the age of 25, he became the youngest Chevrolet dealer in the United States. In 1964, Legum attended the National Automobile Dealers Association convention in Las Vegas, where he met British advertising executive David Ogilvy. He and Ogilvy became friendly, and Ogilvy said \\"You're a clean cut looking young man who should personally go on television and do the advertising for your dealership.\\" Legum followed the advice and was probably the first dealer in Baltimore to do his own advertising. Legum was 22 years old at the time. In 1970, at the age of 28, Legum was elected to the board of directors of United Consolidated Industries (a public company). In 1971, Park Circle Motor Company celebrated 50 years of selling Chevrolets. In 1973, Legum purchased Westminster Chevrolet Cadillac in Westminster, Maryland. It became the largest volume Cadillac dealer in the Baltimore area. In 1977, Park Circle purchased Charlie Irish Chevrolet on Eastern Avenue in the Eastpoint area of Baltimore and closed their original location. The dealership was renamed Legum Chevrolet, with Legum as the CEO. He was elected to membership in the Young Presidents' Organization the same year. In 1980, Legum won an award from General Motors for ‚ÄúService Supremacy‚Äù at Legum Chevrolet. The dealership was evaluated in 23 categories and was found to be outstanding in each category. Legum's dealership was the first Maryland dealership to receive this award from General Motors. In 1981, Legum gained coast-to-coast attention when he was recognized on national television for lending Cadillacs to president-elect Ronald Reagan for his inaugural parade in Washington, D.C. During that same year, Legum purchased H&H; Datsun Dealership and relocated the franchise to Legum's Chevrolet facility, with Chevrolets and Nissans placed on the same showroom floor. Because of this decision, national attention was once again directed at Legum. In 1984, Legum hired actor John Goodman to do what became an award-winning television commercial for Legum Chevrolet Nissan. The commercial aired nationally on the television show \\"Before They Were Stars\\" on CBS. In 1986, Automotive News did a ranking of ‚ÄúSales Giants‚Äù and Legum Chevrolet Nissan placed third largest in the country. In 1989, Legum sold his Chevrolet-Nissan dealership to Bob Bell, a Ford dealership owner in Glen Burnie, Maryland. In 1992, Legum received an award from Bob Starr, general manager of Chevrolet for the completion of 25 years as a Chevrolet dealer. In 1997, Legum sold Westminster Motors, Chevrolet, Oldsmobile and Cadillac to Len Stoler, which ended his family's 76 years in the automobile business. Investment management and The Park Circle Company Legum owns and is CEO of The Park Circle Company, DBA Park Circle Investments, a private investment company with interest in Baltimore-related corporations. In 1962, Park Circle Motor Company sold its wholly owned subsidiary, Truck Rental Company of Baltimore, to Avis in return for cash and 10% interest in Avis. In 1966, Park Circle and Lazard Freres sold Avis to ITT Corporation for stock in ITT. This cash and stock became the basis for Park Circle's original stock portfolio, which was managed by Legum. Legum manages The Park Circle Company hedge fund. From 1972 through 1978, Legum studied investing under the tutelage of F. Palmer Weber, a former University of Virginia professor and professional investor.http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424052748704551504578481233550922310.html#articleTabs_article%3D2 In 1983, Legum started to accumulate stock in Legg Mason which was headed by his friend, Raymond Mason. By 1985, Legum then owned over 5% of the Legg Mason Company and had to report it to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 2009, Legum added an additional company to his portfolio by buying shares in Adams Express Company, a Baltimore company listed on the NYSE. According to the company, Legum is the second-largest shareholder. In 2012, Legum completed the purchase of 5.3% of Cherokee Group, Inc.,http://www.cherokeegroup.com/ a national clothing company, whose products are available in Target and TJ Maxx. In 2015, Legum became the owner of 5.1% of RF Industries, a publicly owned company. Personal life and philanthropy In 1968, Legum married the former Harriet Cohn. In 1989, Legum was active in Park Schools‚Äô 75th Anniversary Capital Campaign. In 1995, Legum was asked by The Park School Board to MC the retirement ceremony for their headmaster, Parvin Sharpless. This event was televised on the local CBS News and WJZ-TV, and was covered by The Baltimore Sun.Letter dated September 7, 1995 from F. Parvin Sharpless - \\"Dear Jeff, Thanks for sending us the video tape of the WJZ-TV program of our retirement \\"evening.\\" Seeing it reminded us of how wonderful it was, and particularly how skillfully you managed the ceremonies, and the generosity and good spirit that you and Harriet contributed. We have many happy feelings about all the end of year events, and we are pleased to have a record of them to keep these memories fresh.\\"WJZ-TV, 11:00 p.m. News, June 11, 1995 In 1997, Legum and his wife co-hosted a Grand Affair at the Baltimore Museum of Art, celebrating the display of art from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The event was attended by members of the British Royal Family. In 2001, Legum and his wife co-chaired a gala celebrating the reinstallation of the Cone Collection at the Baltimore Museum of Art. In 2001, Jeffrey and Harriet Legum donated $1.5 million to Johns Hopkins School of Medicine to create a professorship in acute neurological medicine. In 2003, Legum and his wife donated $3 million to Johns Hopkins to help fund construction of a building which would house both clinical and basic research. In 2013, Jeffrey and Harriet Legum created a $1 million endowment to help fund marketing costs for the Baltimore Museum of Art. In 2014, the Legums gave $2.5 million to Johns Hopkins, in memory of their friend, Jack Griffin, former head of Hopkins Neurology. Through The Legum Foundation, Legum and his wife philanthropically support a wide array of community efforts, such as Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins University, where they endowed The Jeffrey and Harriet Legum Professorship in Acute Neurological Medicine and The John W.

Two were built by the Hunslet Engine Company in 1899, and the third by Kerr, Stuart and Company in 1922. Central London Railway The Central London Railway obtained two small steam locomotives from the Hunslet Engine Company in 1899, to assist with the task of equipping the tunnels once the civil engineering work of building them had been completed. They were numbered 1 and 2, and were of 0-6-0 wheel arrangement, but only the outer wheels had flanges, which enabled them to negotiate curves of radius. They appeared to have very large side tanks, but of the of water carried, only one fifth was used for feeding the boiler, and the rest for condensing the steam. Boiler pressure was , which gave them a tractive effort of . Although the cabs were wide, headroom was extremely limited, and consequently they were oil-fired, so that they could be operated by one man rather than two. Fuel tanks holding of oil were fitted into the bunker, which could also hold 0.75 tons of coal, since the grate was designed so that either fuel could be used. Oil was always used in the tunnels, but coal was often used above ground. Once the railway opened to passengers in July 1900, the locomotives were seldom used in the tunnels, but did occasionally go into them. They were mainly used for shunting in depots and for moving coal wagons at Wood Lane power station, which operated until March 1928. However the two locomotives were scrapped in 1923. City & South London Railway The City & South London Railway was built with tunnels of only diameter, but they were enlarged between 1923 and 1925, when the line amalgamated with the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway. At the same time, the line was extended southwards to Morden, and the railway bought an 0-4-2 saddle tank from Kerr, Stuart and Company in 1922, to assist with the equipping of the extension. The machine weighed 14 tons, the saddle tank held of water, and 0.75 tons of coal could be carried. The driving wheels were in diameter, and it was considerably less powerful than the Central London machines, generating a tractive effort of . The boiler pressure was , and it was known as the 'Brazil'. Kerr, Stuart built a number of Brazil class locomotives, of which four -gauge examples survive in preservation, three on the Sittingbourne and Kemsley Light Railway and one on the Great Whipsnade Railway. The locomotive became L34 in 1930, and worked on the extension of the Piccadilly line to Cockfosters. During this work it was stabled at either Cockfosters or Arnos Grove. It then moved to Drapers Field, Leyton, to work on the Central line eastern extension. This work was completed in 1949, and the locomotive was then scrapped.

He had a variety of business activities, including as a 10% shareholder in Miles Tropical Energy, which had various petroleum concessions off the coast near Dangriga. He was a controversial figure both in life and in death. Charged with manslaughter after killing a man in September 2005, he absented himself from Belize at a time when the charges were upgraded to murder, returned when the charges were downgraded to manslaughter, and then walked free in 2007 when witnesses against him refused to testify. Late the following year he was found dead in his hotel room of a gunshot wound, in what may have been a suicide. Death of Shawn Copious =Shooting and charges= On 17 September 2005 at roughly 3:30 AM, Abou-Nehra returned to his home in King's Park, Belize City to find 23-year-old Shawn Copious in his yard. Abou-Nehra claims Copious advanced on him in a threatening manner. Abou-Nehra had a licensed 9mm pistol on his person, which he drew and fired at Copious six times, killing him. Police found a large meat cleaver on Copious' person. Copious had previously had numerous run-ins with the law, with a conviction for theft and at the time of his death also standing trial for charges of handling stolen goods. Abou-Nehra had earlier that year been accused of shooting a man at BTL Park, but no charges were filed in that incident. Copious' stepfather Lawrence Mejia spoke with Abou- Nehra after Copious' death, and described him as \\"a really good man\\" who showed remorse for the killing and offered what help he could to the family, but expressed confusion that his stepson's injuries were not just limited to a gunshot wound but also consisted of broken teeth, hands, and nose. Abou-Nehra offered BZ$3,000 to Copious' mother Caroline Copious to pay the burial expenses. Police held Abou-Nehra for 48 hours, but at the time regarded the killing as a justifiable use of force and did not file charges. However, in July 2006 police charged him with manslaughter; he was represented by attorneys Kareem Musa and Ellis Arnold in his first court appearance, at which his bail was set at BZ$10,000 and he was given a September court date. As more detail about the circumstances of Copious' death came to light, specifically the fact that he had been shot in the back from five feet away, then-Senior Crown Counsel Cheryl-Lynn Branker-Taitt wrote to Criminal Investigations Bureau chief Chester Williams to recommend that Abou-Nehra be charged with murder. In December 2006, Director of Public Prosecutions Kirk Anderson instructed Commissioner of Polize Gerald Westby to charge Abou-Nehra with murder. However, at that time Abou-Nehra had already departed Belize, according to his attorney Dickie Bradley for purposes of receiving medical care. He then failed to show up for his arraignment hearing in January 2007, at which the complaint of murder was supposed to have been read. A note purporting to be from a doctor in Fort Lauderdale, Florida stated that Abou- Nehra was medically incapable of travelling. In May 2007, he was finally indicted on charges of manslaughter rather than murder. He came before Judge Troadio Gonzalez, who ordered that the case be traversed to the following month's court session due to the large backlog of defendants with charges even older than Abou-Nehra's. His bail was set at BZ$10,000. =Walks free due to police refusal to testify= After Anderson stepped down, the new DPP Lutchman Sooknandan reduced Abou-Nehra's charges back to manslaughter. In July, Sooknandan had to issue a declaration of nolle prosequi because the crown counsel assigned to the case, Cecil Ramirez, had been suspended from practicing law in 2002 and 2003, leading to a question of whether he could legally work for the Office of the DPP. However, Sooknandan said that Abou- Nehra could be re-arrested on the charges. Abou-Nehra came to trial on manslaughter charges again in October. However, three police officers called as witnesses claimed they could not identify him, and the signed record of the caution statement given to Abou-Nehra went missing. Justice Adolph Lucas had no choice but to direct the jury to find Abou-Nehra not guilty of manslaughter. He berated the witnesses as \\"worthless and wicked\\", while Sooknandan described the police's conduct as creating \\"the most shameful miscarriage of justice\\" he had ever seen. Belizean law prohibits double jeopardy, meaning that there was no possibility of a further trial. In October 2007, two of the witnesses Darius Ramos and Anthony Poloni, both constables, were charged with perjury and contradicting previous evidence; they pleaded not guilty. The DPP declined to charge the third witness, former Inspector Clement Cacho, who by then had been demoted to sergeant. An internal police tribunal later found that Ramos, Polonio, and Cacho had committed an \\"Act to the Prejudice of Good Order and Discipline against the Department\\". Cacho was reduced in rank and given half-pay, but later filed suit in the Supreme Court against the police department and in 2010 was awarded reinstatement and back pay. Death In 2008, Abou-Nehra was on holiday up country in Cayo District with his fianc√©e, 22-year-old Evita Bedran, the granddaughter of late hotel magnate Escander Bedran. They went to a disco in Benque Viejo del Carmen a few miles away, where he got into an altercation. His shirt stained with blood, he then returned with Bedran to San Ignacio town and went to their hotel, the San Ignacio Resort Hotel owned by Bedran's family, in order to get a new set of clothes. After changing, he got into another altercation, this time with a security guard at the hotel. Another security guard attempted to calm the two, and got himself pistol-whipped by Abou-Nehra for his trouble, receiving a laceration to the head requiring four stitches. The two security guards filed a police report against Abou-Nehra, while Abou-Nehra himself returned to his room. By the time police arrived at the hotel, Abou-Nehra was laid out on the floor of his hotel room with a gunshot wound. Abou-Nehra was taken first to San Ignacio's Loma Luz Hospital, and then Belize City's Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital, where he was declared dead at 7 AM the following morning. His family expressed suspicion that he would have committed suicide, and requested to have their own forensic pathologist observe the autopsy at KNMH. Pathologist Mario Estradaban declined comment. He was survived by a daughter Madison, as well as his mother Maria and sister Rachelle.

Michael James Robert Dillon was born on 2 October 1798, nearly four months after his father, also called Michael Dillon, had died. Michael Dillon senior had been a captain in the Dublin Militia and he was killed at the Battle of New Ross, opposing the Irish Rebellion against British rule. The young Michael Dillon's mother was Mary Dillon, n√©e Griffith. The eleventh Earl of Roscommon, Patrick Dillon, had been the subject of two prolonged investigations by the Irish House of Lords during the 1790s to ascertain his legitimacy as son of the tenth Earl, against the rival claim by Robert Dillon, a descendant of the seventh son of the first Earl and the next male heir in line. The Earldom of Roscommon became dormant on the death of Patrick Dillon in 1816. Robert Dillon having since died, his claim passed to Michael Dillon, whose grandfather James 'Surgeon' Dillon had been Robert's first cousin. Michael spent 10 years working to prove his claim to the titlehttp://www.roscommonhistory.ie/People/EarlRos/EarlRos.htm until 1828 when the United Kingdom House of Lords decided that he was the rightful heir to the Earldom and he became the twelfth Earl.

It is Bateman's first young adult novel. Plot The story surrounds a twelve-year-old named Eddie and his affiliation with a local gang, known as the \\"Reservoir Pups\\". Eddie's father leaves his mother to run away with her boss, a doctor. His mother finds herself a new nursing job at the Royal Victoria Maternity Hospital, however it's located in a run-down section of Belfast; the pair move there regardless. A short time after they arrive, Scuttles, the chief of hospital security, accuses Eddie of scamming the locals and of being part of a neighbourhood gang, the \\"Reservoir Pups\\", for which his mum scolds him also. Given that all the people in his life believe he is already part of the gang, Eddie decides to join. He is tasked with stealing the security codes from Scuttles' computer and while attempting to do so, hears of a plot to kidnap twelve babies from the hospital nursery, abandoning his mission. Returning to the gang, Eddie is ostracised for his failure to complete his task and he is told to \\"watch his back\\". Eddie then sets out to foil the kidnapping himself. Characters * Eddie Malone; twelve-year-old boy, protagonist of the story. * Bernard Scuttles; chief of hospital security and boyfriend of Eddies mum. * Captain Black; paraplegic boy and leader of the gang. * Alison Beech; owner of the cosmetics company that is attempting to kidnap the babies. Reception The novel was well received, with reviewers praising the pace of the novel and the complex themes discussed throughout. Publishers Weekly called the novel a \\"rippingly paced\\", \\"zany caper cloaked in the droll, dark comedy that marks [Bateman's] adult fiction\\", praising the \\"cleverly convoluted plot\\"; and concluding that \\"how all the strands come together in this innovative, far-fetched tale makes for great entertainment, and Bateman's appealing young hero is entirely credible\\". Candice Cooper, writing for Kaboose, called the novel a \\"fun, witty, tale of a 12 year-old boy with a gigantic amount of integrity and ambition\\", commenting that \\"it's important for him to do the right thing and he works very hard to accomplish it\\". She does go on to comment, however, that the \\"gang aspect of the book is a bit disturbing at times\\", finding that to perhaps be inappropriate for a book aimed at this audience. Cooper awarded the novel a score of four out of five. Kirkus Reviews found that the \\"fast-paced plot gradually moves the reader from recognizable reality into a neverland of impossible characters and larger-than-life evildoers\\", concluding that \\"for the lovers of nonstop action and understated British humor, this will be a satisfying page-turner. Unpretentiously unpredictable\\". Children's book reviewer, Inis Magazine, found that \\"in this mixture between 'problem novel' ... and Dahlesque novel of the grotesque, with a humanised version of 101 Dalmatians thrown in for good measure, Bateman creates a strange juxtaposition of pathos, comedy and shocking grotesquerie\\". Reviewer Amanda Piesse also commented on the \\"swift pace\\" and \\"hyperbolic tone\\" throughout; in conclusion finding it to be \\"highly thought-provoking in terms of both form and content, this book had me re- reading it the moment I'd finished it\\". BookPage reviewer Alice Cary commented on the negative connection people may make with the subject matter for this novel, stating \\"between the witty word-smithing of Irish novelist Colin Bateman and the engaging voice of his protagonist, Eddie, readers are in good hands\\". Cary continues to state that while many elements of the novels plot could be considered unrealistic, \\"Eddie's narration makes it riveting and funny, and the story always rings true\\". =Controversy= The descriptions of \\"Mo\\", a young albino girl, caused controversy for Bateman at a school in Ballymena, Northern Ireland.

Melik sau sim»õul practic la Junimea\\", in Convorbiri Literare, December 2006 August 9, 1840 ‚Äì January 29, 1889), was a Wallachian, later Romanian mathematician, educator and political figure, one of the early members of Junimea literary society. Known for his work in private education, and for his tenure at the University of Ia»ôi, he was the author of several early introductions to science‚Äîdealing with arithmetic and geometry, but also with topography and surveying. He was perceived as a bland figure at Junimea meetings, and had little to do with its literary agenda, but took care of administrative chores and, for a while, of its publishing venture. Taking his cue from the Junimist leadership, Melik followed the literary club as it transformed itself into a liberal conservative party. He represented Ia»ôi city in the Assembly of Deputies in the 1884 legislature, and then, under a Junimist government, helped enforce Titu Maiorescu's policies in the educational field. Melik is also remembered as an engineer and entrepreneur, who contributed to the modern history of Coste»ôtii Boto»ôanilor village, his personal estate. Biography =Early years= The future scientist was born in Bucharest, the Wallachian capital, on August 9, 1840 (although traditionally believed to have been born on August 15 or August 21, Mihai Dim. Sturdza, \\"Junimea, societate secretƒÉ\\", in Convorbiri Literare, June 2004 and wrongly credited in some documents as a \\"Ia»ôi native\\"). Liviu Papuc, \\"Masoneria junimistƒÉ\\", in Revista Sud-Est, Nr. 4/2006 He was of Armenian origins: the Meliks traced their origin to Ohan, a Gregorian Armenian clergyman. I. M. Melik's parents were Ohan's son, Arakel \\"Popovici\\" Melik, and his wife Maria Gedik; they had two other children: Gavril, a boy, and Anika, a girl. Ohan's other son, Iacob Melic, was a successful architect. The Ottoman statesman Mustafa Reshid Pasha recommended his work to the Wallachian government, but Iacob left the country and settled in Paris.Iorga, p. 92 From his new home, Iacob Melik corresponded with the exiled leaders of the 1848 Revolution, in particular the moderate and pro-Ottoman faction of Ion Ghica, Alexandru G. Golescu and Nicolae Ple»ôoianu.Iorga, pp. 92‚Äì95 According to his own testimony, Ioan first attended the Armenian School in Bucharest's Yellow District, and then regular school in that same neighborhood. From 1854 to 1856, he completed secondary school at the Saint Sava College and was, in his own account, an award-winning student. From 1856, Iacob Melik took over the boy's education, taking him to Imperial France. Young Melik was tutored at a private boarding house (1857), before enlisting at the University of Paris Medical School, but changed his mind and applied for the √âcole des Mines de Paris (1860). He finished school in 1864, and worked for a short while at salt mines in France and Belgium. Melik's work took him to Moldavia, which, in 1859, had federated with Wallachia into the United Principalities. The regime of Domnitor Alexander John Cuza assigned him to inspect the Moldavian salt mines, at SlƒÉnic and T√¢rgu Ocna. Known to his Ia»ôi colleagues and friends as Mirmilic,CƒÉlinescu, p. 440 he began attending the Junimea club in 1865, being one of the outside sympathizers of the cause, and manifestly lacking literary ambitions. Iacob Negruzzi, the Junimea co-founder and biographer of its members, asserted: \\"[Melik was] once a passionate Junimist, but always kept silent.\\" Constantin Coroiu, \\"Farmecul discret al documentului (II)\\", in Convorbiri Literare, September 2008 Negruzzi jokingly added that the standard estimate, according to which the maths teacher had uttered some 23 words at club meetings held between 1865 and 1880, was probably exaggerated in Melik's favor. Literary historian George CƒÉlinescu suggests that Melik, like astronomer Niculae Culianu or schoolteacher Pavel Paicu, only came to Junimea \\"out of devotion or for the sake of entertainment\\".CƒÉlinescu, pp. 439‚Äì440 The mathematician was notorious for not having published a single line in the Junimist tribune, Convorbiri Literare.A. D. Xenopol, I. E. Torou»õiu, Istoria ideilor mele (Wikisource version of the 1933 print) =Junimist projects= With his Junimist credentials, Melik was made substitute Professor of Mathematics at Ia»ôi University (February 23, 1865). He acquired tenure in April 1866, shortly after Cuza's regime had been replaced by a Princely Lieutenancy. Soon after receiving this honor, Melik became a conservative ally of the Junimist Rector, Titu Maiorescu, helping him do battle with the University's well connected liberal club. As noted CƒÉlinescu, the University's Junimist circle was formed around Professors Melik, Culianu, I. Neguzzi, Ioan Caragiani and Nicolae Mandrea, with Junimea itself being \\"a political get- together with some cultural aspects.\\"CƒÉlinescu, pp. 399‚Äì400 Although still recognized as a secondary and inactive participant, Melik was involved on several early Junimist projects, and referred to by Maiorescu as the group's \\"banker\\". In addition to promoting Junimist goals at University, he participated in founding (and financing) the club's own private school, or \\"Academic Institute\\". He himself described the event as follows: \\"In summer 1866, I have founded the Academic Institute, in partnership with several colleagues, from both University and High School [that is, the National High School Ia»ôi].\\" Melik took personal care about furnishing the Institute, purchasing its books from prestigious companies such as Hachette, and keeping score of the more reliable publishing houses in Moldavia and Wallachia. The institution itself left a mark on Romanian educational history, being seen as a model school in the field of private enterprise.Vianu, pp. 32‚Äì33 It remains primarily noted for its contribution in Humanities, which were assigned to Maiorescu. Constantin Meissner, the dedicated student and future Junimist pedagogue, recalled: \\"we [students] found ourselves speaking, gesticulating, moving our heads just like our precious model [Maiorescu].\\"Vianu, p. 33 Another former student, and later teacher at the Institute, was scholar A. D. Xenopol. He describes his alma mater as \\"an eminent private school\\", and Melik as one of the \\"leading professorial forces\\" in Moldavia; he also credits Melik's \\"complete and measured exactitude\\" as influential for his own work ethic. According to Xenopol, Melik's refusal to tolerate staff truancy earned him a reputation as a strict colleague. Referencing an Armenian stereotype, the other Junimists began calling Melik a mindirigiu (\\"quilter\\") of their absences. Melik was, with Vasile Pogor and Al. Farra, a manager of the literary club's own publishing company‚Äîa bankrupt project, since Pogor would only purchase books from his own area of interest.Ornea (I), p. 28 Before going down, this commercial branch of Junimea put out a number of general education works, including Melik's textbook Elemente de aritmeticƒÉ (\\"Elements of Arithmetic\\"). Richard Constantinescu, \\"Doctorul Anastasie FƒÉtu despre Societatea Junimea\\", in Revista Rom√¢nƒÉ (ASTRA), Nr. 1/2009, p. 32; Gheorghe Manolache, \\"Sub patronajul Junimii din Ia»ôi (1863‚Äì1874). Literaritate »ôi literalitate sau arta de a traduce pe Schiller\\" , in Transilvania, Nr. 10-11/2005, p. 24; Vianu, p. 8 Melik was also a cashier during Junimea anniversaries. Witnessing the decline of Junimist capital, he even proposed, unsuccessfully, that the club fortunes be invested in a salt mine. Melik was not dissuaded by the opposition, and continued to draft plans about investing Junimist money, forming a credit union, and opening up the Humpel girls' institute. His record of Junimea gains and expenses is seen by philologist Constantin Coroiu as evidence of Melik's \\"computer-like rigor\\". According to Negruzzi, Melik was an outstandingly passionate defender of Maiorescu's reputation. When the Junimist leader was framed a statutory rape scandal and taken to court, Melik provoked the judge to a duel, over not being allowed to enter the courthouse. On February 18, 1867, the Junimist mathematician was also admitted into the conservative wing of Romanian Freemasonry, or \\"Star of Romania\\" Lodge. This branch of the Oriental Rite of Memphis and the Grand Orient de France, wherein Pogor himself had reached the 90th Degree, had for its Iorgu Sutzu as its Venerable Master, and came to include most of the Junimist notabilities. On October 21 of the same year, Melik was granted the Fellow Craft Rank in Masonic orders. Noting the role of Junimist Masons in combating the liberals' stated xenophobia, researcher Mihai Dim. Sturdza suggests that the \\"Star of Romania\\" was in fact \\"a place of refuge, [...] where the foreign-born intellectuals [...] created a bloc with the conservative boyars and the Jewish merchants\\". Their main liberal detractors included senior academic Simion BƒÉrnu»õiu and other outspoken antisemites. =Institutele-Unite and Assembly mandate= Melik's 1867 arithmetic course was highly popular, going through ten reprints. He followed up with other textbooks and introductory courses: Despre moneta rom√¢nƒÉ (\\"On the Romanian Currency\\", 1868); Elemente de Geometrie (\\"Elements of Geometry\\", 1869, ten reprints); Elemente de Topografie (\\"Elements of Topography\\", 1879, four reprints). From 1883 to 1888, Melik, Culianu and Constantin Climescu put out the magazine Recrea»õii »òtiin»õifice (\\"Scientific Recreations\\"), considered a direct precursor of the more prestigious Gazeta MatematicƒÉ. Vasile Oproiu, \\"Centenarul Seminarului Matematic A. Myller\\", in Recrea»õii Matematice, Nr. 1/2010, p. 1 The author continued his work at the Institute before and after 1875, when it merged with the \\"New High School\\" into the private-run Institutele-Unite (\\"Unified Institutes\\"). That year, he also formalized his adoption by Ia»ôi city, by beginning construction work on a townhouse (completed 1882). The new Domnitor, Carol I, recognized Melik's educational merits by granting him the Benemerenti medal 1st class. \\"Sciri din Rom√¢n√≠a\\", in Familia, Nr. 92/1880, p. 576 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Shortly after the establishment of the Romanian Kingdom, Melik also made his way into the Junimist political party. Maiorescu, who led Junimea members in and out of the opposition Conservative Party, assigned him a place on the independent list for Ia»ôi in the election of 1884. In practice, Melik, Pogor, Negruzzi and others were in a cartel with the ruling National Liberals, and were elected deputies on a united pro-government list.Ornea (I), pp. 298‚Äì299 A while after, with Premier Ion BrƒÉtianu ignoring repeated Junimist requests for cabinet positions, the entire faction moved back into the opposition.Ornea (I), pp. 299‚Äì302 Carol I, the newly crowned King of Romania, again rewarded Melik's services: in February 1884, Monitorul Oficial published news that the mathematician had been made Officer of the Order of the Star of Romania; when later errata informed Melik that he was merely a Knight of that company, he refused to accept the award altogether. Melik was still an active popularizer on scientific topics, publishing, in 1885, a surveying and ballistics tract: Equerulu grafometru sau quadrantulu de campania al D-lui Colonel de Artilerie A. Costiescu (\\"The Graphometer or Campaign Quadrant of the Artillery Colonel A. Costiescu\\"). In 1888, he issued three new textbooks: Arithmetic for 3rd- and 4th-graders, Geometry for the primary course, and a Curs practic de Geometrie elementarƒÉ (\\"Practical Course in Elementary Geometry\\"). By then, I. M. Melik had invested his money into a large-scale agricultural venture, on the Moldavian estate of Coste»ôtii Boto»ôanilor. The purchase took place in March 1885. As he himself noted, 507 f√°lce of land (some 726 hectares) were exchanged for his 210,000 lei, cash. This was a third of the estate, as defined by tradition, and a half of the actual village. Elena Florica »òuster, \\"O monografie meritorie\\", in the Armenian-Romanian community magazine Ararat, Nr. 2/2005, p. 6 =Final appointments, illness and death= In March 1888, after prolonged political infighting, Carol I turned his back on both the Conservatives and the National Liberals. The Junimists experienced a moment of triumph, with Theodor Rosetti as Premier and Maiorescu as Education Minister. For a while, Melik himself was Secretary General of the Education Ministry, his position at the University filled in by I. D. Rallet. The Junimist loyalist was assigned by Maiorescu to inspect the Moldavian schools. Their common goal was to purge from the schooling system a new political threat: socialist activists. Melik was ordered to work only with the known anti-socialists, and to sack all those suspected of having affiliated with the socialist clubs.Ornea (II), pp. 314‚Äì315 In one such letter, the Minister instructs his subordinate to inquire about whether the known Marxist Ioan NƒÉdejde still had relatives working on a state salary. In early 1889, still active as General Inspector of the Schools and Principal of Institutele-Unite, \\"Ce e nou? Necrol√≥ge\\", in Familia, Nr. 7/1889, p. 84 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Melik was struck down with a quickly progressing illness. His death, on January 29, was perceived as a tragedy by his fellow Junimists. Poet Anton Naum wrote, shortly after the events, \\"We have lost poor Melik in the space of 7 days, however good and healthy he had been. It left me with a hallowed heart, seeing that we were very close.\\" Melik's brief obituary in Familia magazine informed readers that the inspector's schoolbooks had \\"genuine value\\". Later, the post-Junimist historiographer I. E. Torou»õiu presented Melik as a highly moral man of action: \\"He was one of the society's devoted members, without ever asking it for perks [or] advancements, even though he was in a position to demand them, under the governments of his political friends.\\" Melik was survived by his widow and their four children (four others had died in infancy). His son, Eugen I. Melik, who took over his papers, was known professionally as a Law Professor at the University of Ia»ôi. \\"Citim √Æn ziarul nostru de acum 100 de ani. Evenimentul 1909\\", in Evenimentul, January 16, 2010 Melik Jr also built the towering landmark of Coste»ôtii Boto»ôanilor, a castle-shaped vacation home. One half of the village is commonly known as Coste»ôti-Melic.

On 1 July 1914, while filming on location in Canon City, Colorado, cast member Grace McHugh was filming a scene where her character was crossing the Arkansas River in a boat. When the boat capsized, camera operator Owen Carter immediately jumped into the river to save her. He dragged her onto a sandbar that was reported to be quicksand. The rest of the film crew watched helplessly as they were sucked into the sandbar and drowned. *The Birth of a Nation (1915). Future film director Erich von Stroheim fell off a roof and broke two ribs in one scene as an extra. *The Girl of the Golden West (1915). Actor House Peters Sr. suffered serious burns to his face and hands when a prop pistol exploded upon being fired.Katchmer, George A. Eighty Silent Film Stars: Biographies and Filmographies of the Obscure to the Well Known. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 1991. p-785. *The Captive (1915). During filming of a scene where soldiers were required to break down a locked door, the extras fired at the door using live ammunition to give the scene more realism. The director then ordered the extras to reload with blanks in order to film the next shot in which the door is broken down. But one of the extras inadvertently left a live round in his rifle which discharged, shooting another extra, Charles Chandler, in the head, killing him instantly.DeMille, Cecil B., and Donald Hayne, ed. The Autobiography of Cecil B. DeMille. London: W.H. Allen, 1960. p-116-117. *The Woman God Forgot (1917). In one scene, extras were required to be thrown over the side of an Aztec pyramid. The 'pyramid' was built of wood and covered in paper on which sand had been glued to create the appearance of stone. The extras were 'sand-papered' as they slid down the side of the structure. Having expected such injuries, a crew member was waiting at the bottom with a bucket of iodine.Fountain, Leatrice G., and John R. Maxim 1985: Dark Star. London: Sidgwick & Jackson. p-189. *The Valley of the Giants (1919). Silent-era star Wallace Reid was badly injured in a train crash during filming in Oregon. His injuries caused him severe pain and the studio supplied him with increasing quantities of morphine so he could keep working. Addicted to morphine and also suffering from alcoholism, Reid died in 1923 at the age of 31. *Unidentified Henry Lehrman comedy (1919): Comedian Billie Ritchie, while working on a short comedy film, was kicked in the stomach by an ostrich and sustained internal injuries.Steve Massa- Lame Brains and Lunatics pp. 66-67 1920s *Haunted Spooks (1920). On the set of a publicity shoot that took place while filming, actor and comedian Harold Lloyd picked up what he thought was a prop bomb with the fuse lit but realized too late the bomb was real. It detonated, blowing off the thumb and first finger of his right hand and also temporarily blinding him. For the rest of his career, Lloyd concealed his missing fingers with a prosthetic glove. *The Skywayman (1920). Pilots Milton Elliott and Ormer Locklear were killed on 2 August 1920, during filming. Their plane crashed at the DeMille Airfield, along Wilshire Blvd. in Los Angeles, while filming night scenes. *Manslaughter (1922).

Stunt pilot Dick Kerwood suffered a severe concussion during filming. He was to parachute from a Standard-J biplane which was loaded with explosives set to go off after he baled out of the aircraft. However the timer was faulty, causing the explosives to detonate when Kerwood was still on board. He was thrown clear and, although dazed, managed to open his parachute in time.Carlson, Mark. Flying on Film: A Century of Aviation in the Movies 1912-2012. Bearmanor Media, 2012 p35. *Souls for Sale (1923). Actress Barbara La Marr injured her ankle during filming and doctors prescribed not only morphine but also cocaine to control the pain and enable her to continue filming. Working on the production left La Marr addicted to drugs, a factor that contributed to her premature death three years later. *Sherlock Jr. (1924). While hanging from a water tower, Buster Keaton pulled a rope that released water from the tower, knocking him to the ground. In the scene, he stood and ran into the distance. During a routine physical examination 11 years later, an X-ray revealed that Keaton's neck had been fractured. *The Warrens of Virginia (1924). On 29 November 1923, while working on location in San Antonio, Texas, Martha Mansfield was severely burned when a match, tossed by a cast member, ignited her Civil War costume of hoopskirts and flimsy ruffles. Mansfield was playing the role of Agatha Warren and had just finished her scenes and retired to a car when her clothing burst into flames. Her neck and face were saved when leading man Wilfred Lytell threw his heavy overcoat over her. The hands of the chauffeur of Mansfield's car were badly burned while he tried to remove the actress' burning clothing. The fire was put out, but she sustained substantial burns to her body and died the following day.New York Times, \\"Martha Mansfield, Film Star, Dies of Burns Caused by Costume Fired by Smoker's Match\\", 1 December 1923, Page 1. *Ben-Hur (1925). An early filming attempt of the chariot race was done on location at the Circus Maximus in Rome. It brought about the death of one stuntman when a wheel of his chariot broke. quoted in * The General (1926). During filming of the epic comedy in Oregon, there were a number of incidents. Several National Guardsmen, employed as extras for the Civil War battle scenes, were injured by mishaps caused by misfired muskets or explosions. Director and star Buster Keaton was knocked unconscious when he stood too close to a cannon firing. Assistant director Harry Barnes was accidentally hit in the face by a blank charge. Train brakeman Fred Lowry sued the production for US$2,900 after his foot was crushed when it was run over by a locomotive wheel during filming of one of the railway scenes. *Wings (1927). During filming of the World War I aerial combat scenes, stunt pilot Dick Grace was required to deliberately crash-land a Fokker D-VII, specially modified to \\"crumple\\" on impact. When the Fokker struck the ground, the landing gear failed to crumple, making the impact a heavier one than planned. This caused Grace's safety straps to break, sending his head through the instrument panel, leaving him with four crushed vertebrae and a broken neck. Amazingly, Grace spent only six weeks in the hospital and was again performing stunt work within a year. *Noah's Ark (1928). Three people died, one man lost a leg and a number were injured in a scene where several hundred extras were caught in the \\"Great Flood.\\" The deaths were instrumental in the introduction of film safety regulations the following year. * The Aviator (1929). During aerial scouting for locations, an aircraft crashed, killing cameraman Alvin Knechtel and actor and stunt pilot William Hauber. *The Godless Girl (1929). The filming of one scene required cast members Lina Basquette and George Duryea to be trapped in a burning building and both actors had their clothing, hair and exposed skin covered with an asbestos coating. During filming, Duryea, concerned that the pyrotechnic flames were getting too hot and too close, retreated from the set but Basquette, eager to impress director Cecil B DeMille, insisted on remaining until the scene was completed despite the intense heat. The actress suffered serious burns and blistering to her forearms and her eyebrows and lashes were singed.Basquette, Lina. Lina: DeMille's Godless Girl. Fairfax, VA: Denlinger's Publishers, 1990. p-116-117. * Unknown film (1929). Strongheart, a German Shepherd film star, was accidentally burned after coming into contact with a hot studio light. The burn became tumorous, leading to his death later that year. 1930s *Hell's Angels (1930). Three pilots were killed during the filming. The sole Sikorsky S-29-A, owned by Roscoe Turner, which portrayed a German Gotha bomber, crashed during filming on 22 March 1929 when stunt pilot Al Wilson put it in a spin for its final scene and was unable to recover. He was ready to bail out and called back to his mechanic Phil Jones (who was in the rear of the plane dumping lampblack to simulate smoke) to jump, but Jones didn't hear him and went down with the plane. Only one brief shot of the spinning Sikorsky was used in the film. Two other stunt pilots, Al Johnson and Clement Phillips, were killed in separate accidents.

This scene was shot on her first day on set after having undergone an emergency appendectomy and Colbert and the director disregarded concerns raised by the on-set nurse. Filming in the unsanitary conditions while not yet fully recovered led to Colbert being hospitalized with a severe fever two days later.Quirk, Lawrence J. Claudette Colbert: An Illustrated Biography. New York: Crown, 1985.p-62. * The Lost Patrol (1934). During filming in high temperatures in Buttercup Valley near Yuma, Arizona, Director John Ford insisted his cast and crew only work in the early mornings and late afternoons to avoid the most intense heat of each day.

Ford refused, believing that many of the crew would be at risk of heatstroke in the 120-degree F conditions. Reid tried to prove his point by walking around in the open in the midday heat and soon collapsed with heat exhaustion, requiring hospital treatment.Nollen, Scott Allen.

The girl only suffered minor burns thanks to the quick thinking of make-up artist Frank Westmore who raced over and tore off her burning costume. During the filming of the same scene, several Egyptian extras were stung by scorpions, or bitten by cobras, both of which had been blown out of their burrows in the sand by the artificially generated storm.Westmore, Frank, and Muriel Davidson.

The episode originally aired on NBC on May 10, 2012. \\"Free Family Portrait Studio\\" was written and directed by B. J. Novak, who also wrote and directed the season premiere \\"The List\\". The episode guest stars Andy Buckley, Jack Coleman, Sendhil Ramamurthy, Jerry Minor, and Michael Schur. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, David Wallace (Andy Buckley) helps Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) go undercover and stage a coup, and a new opportunity arises for Robert California (James Spader). \\"Free Family Portrait Studio\\" received mixed reviews from critics, with many noting that the episode did not feel like a proper season finale. It was viewed by 4.49 million viewers and received a 2.3 rating/6% share among adults between the age of 18 and 49. The episode ranked third in its timeslot and was also the highest-rated NBC series of the night.  Synopsis  Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) offers free family portraits in the office, and many members of the office take advantage of the opportunity, including Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) with his very elderly parents, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) with his teenaged daughter Sasha, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with her teenaged son, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) with Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a desperate Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) holding up various signs to try to win back Kelly's affection yet again, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with a reluctant Jim (John Krasinski) and their children Cecelia and Philip. Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) later comes by with his and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) son Philip to also get a family portrait. Jim suspects that Dwight's motive for giving away family portraits was to get revenge on Jim for a prank involving a fake Velcro suit, but Dwight's real motive was to try to get some of Philip Lipton's DNA to run a test to determine who Philip's actual father is. Angela is very much against this idea and tries to ensure that Dwight does not get the opportunity. After taking the pictures, Robert notices that Philip's diaper is full, so he goes to change him. After doing so Dwight goes into the bathroom to retrieve the diaper, but Angela chases after him as he makes a break for the hospital to run the DNA test. Dwight and Angela then take part in a high-speed car chase until Dwight calls his cousin Mose (Michael Schur) to take her off his trail with a duplicate Trans Am. Angela later finds him in the hospital waiting area, where he confirms he is going to be there for the entire 72-hour waiting period for the DNA results. After she sits down, holding his hand, Dwight begins kissing her and Angela briefly demurs before passionately kissing him in return. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) comes into the office, wearing shabby clothing, and walks straight into manager Nellie Bertram's (Catherine Tate) office and pleads for a job. She eventually caves and makes him janitor for the day. Later, Andy admits in a talking head interview that he has actually convinced former CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) to buy Dunder Mifflin from Sabre and then make him the regional manager yet again; Andy is wearing the shabby clothing and making himself smell of alcohol in order to make everyone believe that he is doing poorly, and does embarrassing things such as spilling soup on himself throughout the day, wanting a \\"delicious moment\\" when he goes from janitor to regional manager. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), secretly aware of the plan, becomes concerned, unsure if Andy will be able to recover from this image even after he becomes manager. Andy becomes very dependent on David arriving at the office until David calls him to say that he cannot make it until the next Friday. Andy then announces the plan and upon hearing this everyone, even Erin, assumes that Andy's conversations with David are hallucinations because none of them have seen Andy talking with David. However, David surprisingly shows up to the office and assures everyone that he is indeed buying Dunder Mifflin from Sabre with the $20 million that he got from selling a toy-vacuum invention called \\"Suck-it\\" to the United States Military. Andy goes through with his \\"delicious moment\\" plan, but no one seems to take much care, as they are more interested in the news of ownership, ruining Andy's moment. David also reveals that Jo Bennett is planning on liquidating the rest of Sabre. Upon hearing this news, Sabre CEO Robert California (James Spader) approaches David in an oddly excitable tone, introducing himself as \\"Bob Kazamakis\\" and takes him to the conference room to negotiate. When Andy is reinstated as manager, he relishes the \\"delicious moment\\" he can have when he fires Nellie, but she begs him by reciting Shakespeare's quality of mercy quote from The Merchant of Venice. Frustrated that he cannot have his moment, but taking pity on her, Andy gives Nellie a new job as special projects manager. Robert later tells the office that he will be leaving for the next three years and going to \\"help\\" undereducated high school gymnasts, mostly Eastern European, with matching funds of one million dollars, which he convinces David to donate, disgusting the rest of the office. He then exits the office once and for all by giving Andy a kiss, possibly as a symbol of his power being regained, puts his arm around Andy and says to the office, \\"It's been a great year.\\" Former warehouse workers and lottery winners Calvin (Calvin Tenner) and Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) approach Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) asking for their jobs back as they made a bad investment in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals (which Robert is later seen drinking, and complains about the \\"coconut\\" flavor in the \\"coconut penis\\"). Darryl accepts them back and shows them around the warehouse and introduces them to new foreman Val (Ameenah Kaplan). Val's boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), is also there with her and notices the blatant compliments that Darryl gives to Val. Brandon then tells Darryl off which he responds to by just simply walking away. Later, Darryl and his daughter, Jada, are taking pictures at the family portrait studio; Val joins them and holds Darryl's hand. At the end of the episode, Robert Lipton walks out of the building with Philip and he notices Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez). Robert asks why Oscar did not call after the fundraiser and heavily hints at his attraction to Oscar, which Oscar has repeatedly suggested to be the case. Oscar appears taken aback, but flattered and tempted. Production \\"Free Family Portrait Studio\\" was written and directed by executive producer B. J. Novak, who also portrays Ryan Howard in the series, marking the last of his 15 writing and five directing credits for the series as Novak ended his day-to-day involvement with the series before Season 9 to work on \\"The Mindy Project\\". The episode features the third consecutive appearance of the character David Wallace (Andy Buckley), former CFO of Dunder Mifflin, the seventh appearance of Jack Coleman as Angela's husband, State Senator Robert Lipton, the second appearance of Sendhil Ramamurthy as Kelly's boyfriend Ravi, having previously appeared in the episode \\"Angry Andy\\", and the second appearance of former Saturday Night Live cast member Jerry Minor as Val's boyfriend Brandon, having previously appeared in the episode \\"After Hours\\". Former Office writer/producer Michael Schur appears as Dwight's cousin Mose for the 10th time, and the first since the episode \\"Garden Party\\" earlier in the season. James Spader, who portrayed Robert California, made his final appearance for the eighth season. The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Robert complimenting Jim and Pam's marriage and admitting his desire to share in their love, which the two take as a metaphorical compliment, Jim receiving a text from Robert asking him if Pam and he are free at 10 the following Friday which causes the two to think that California literally wants to be a part of their relationship, Pam trying to reassure Jim that Robert's odd behavior is a figment of their imagination, and Robert calling off the get-together due to this resignation as CEO of Sabre. Jim, out of curiosity, asks him what he was planning, to which he replies \\"a three-way\\".

Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club wrote that \\"Free Family Portrait Studio\\" proved to be \\"a disheartening conclusion to the show‚Äôs worst season, offering little optimism to sustain our already dwindling enthusiasm over the summer months.\\" He continued to say that the season made him have little interest in \\"seeing anything further from Andy Bernard\\". Despite this, he complimented the Dwight subplot due to its slight connection to real human emotions. He ultimately gave the episode a C+. HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote that he hoped the new showrunner, following Paul Lieberstein, would undo the developments made in the finale, criticizing the season's run of Andy Bernard as manager and Nellie Bertram's character. He also wrote that he would only view the first handful of episodes, due to the new showrunner and the hope that the season would improve. Cindy White of IGN wrote that the episode \\"hit all the marks\\" as a season finale, and said she was happy that Sabre was finally gone from the series. She complimented the good writing and character moments, but criticized the possible return of Nellie and the handling of the Angela-Dwight storyline over the season. She ultimately gave the episode an 8.0/10, calling it \\"great\\". Additionally, multiple critics criticized Andy's over-dramatization while trying to make a comeback to Dunder Mifflin.

From PID to active disturbance rejection control[J]. IEEE transactions on Industrial Electronics, 2009, 56(3): 900-906. (or ADRC) inherits from proportional‚Äìintegral‚Äìderivative (PID). It embraces the power of nonlinear feedback and puts it to full use. It is a robust control method that is based on extension of the system model with an additional and fictitious state variable, representing everything that the user does not include in the mathematical description of the plant. This virtual state (sum of internal and external disturbances, usually denoted as a \\"total disturbance\\") is estimated online with a state observer and used in the control signal in order to decouple the system from the actual perturbation acting on the plant. This disturbance rejection feature allows user to treat the considered system with a simpler model, since the negative effects of modeling uncertainty are compensated in real time. As a result, the operator does not need a precise analytical description of the system, as one can assume the unknown parts of dynamics as the internal disturbance in the plant. Robustness and the adaptive ability of this method makes it an interesting solution in scenarios where the full knowledge of the system is not available.

It can also estimate unknown model's perturbation. Hence, ADRC isn't dependent on mathematic model. =Nonlinear PID= The success of PID control is error feedback. ADRC uses nonlinear state error feedback, so Han call it Nonlinear PID. In linearization system, people can also use weighted state errors as feedback.

It was created on 26 September 1991 as a successor to the KGB and its republican affiliate in the Uzbek SSR. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, it has retained the same responsibilities and a similar range of functional units, including paramilitary police and special forces. It was renamed from the National Security Service on 14 March 2018. The SNB was a rival of the Interior Ministry until 2005, when it was brought under its control. In recent years, the SNB has been sidelined in favor of the Uzbekistan National Guard, which was largely seen as being loyal to former president Islam Karimov. The SNB is described by Amnesty International and the Institute for War and Peace Reporting as a secret police force.Secrets and Lies: Forced Confessions Under Torture in Uzbekistan, Amnesty International (April 15, 2015).Uzbek Secret Police Roam Russian Prisons, News Briefing Central Asia (Institute for War and Peace Reporting) (January 9, 2013).

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on \\"Tashkent clan\\" A reorganisation of the security and counter-terrorism agencies in the aftermath of the Andijan massacre significantly increased the power and resources of the SNB. In February 2019, the SNB head Ikhtiyor Abdullayev was fired after he was accused to have conducted surveillance on President Shavkat Mirziyoyev's personal phone. Some analysts maintain that the SNB is under the control of the Tashkent clan, a powerful faction within the Uzbek elite.Changes in Uzbekistan's Military Policy after the Andijan Events Central Asia-Institute Silk Road Studies Program The following people served as chairmen of the Uzbek KGB: * Alexei Byzov (20 April 1954 ‚Äì 11 February 1960) * Georgy Naymushin (26 February 1960 ‚Äì 14 December 1963) * Sergey Kiselev (14 December 1963 ‚Äì 25 October 1969) * Alexey Beschastnovr (25 October 1969 ‚Äì 25 October 1974) * Eduard Nordman (25 October 1974 ‚Äì 2 March 1978) * Levon Melkumov (2 March 1978 ‚Äì 24 August 1983) * Vladimir Golovin (24 August 1983 ‚Äì 27 January 1989) * Anatoly Morgasov (23 February 1989 ‚Äì 12 June 1991) * Gulam Aliyev (12 June 1991 ‚Äì 26 September 1991) Activities and human rights abuses The SNB has been closely associated with the authoritarian administration of President Islam Karimov, and has been accused of involvement in human rights abuses and in sponsoring acts of terrorism to provide a pretext for repressive policing. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has reported claims that the 1999 Tashkent bombings were carried out by the SNB, then led by Rustam Inoyatov of the Tashkent clan, and that the SNB may also have been responsible for a series of bombings in 2004 in Tashkent and Bukhara. Radio Free Europe feature on bombings Fear of the SNB is so widespread in Uzbekistan that it is considered dangerous to say its name in public. =Torture= The U.S. Department of State's 2004 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Uzbekistan stated that SNB officials \\"tortured, beat, and harassed\\" citizens.2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Uzbekistan, United States Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (February 28, 2005). =Andijan massacre= On 13 May 2005 SNB troops, along with military and Interior Ministry forces, killed a large number of protesters in Andijan, in an event that became known as the Andijan massacre.Preliminary findings on the events in Andijan Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (June 2005).Documenting Andijan, Council for Foreign Relations (26 June 2006).

The OpenNet Initiative reports that the SNB: :\\"monitors the Uzbek sector of the Internet and 'stimulates' ISPs and Internet caf√©s to practice self-censorship. Soviet-style censorship structures were replaced by 'monitoring sections' that work under SNB‚Äôs guidance. There is no mandatory government prepublication review, but ISPs risk having their licenses revoked if they post 'inappropriate' information. Occasionally, the SNB orders ISPs to block access to opposition or religious Web sites. A survey of internet filtering practices among Uzbek ISPs was conducted by ONI in January 2007. Respondents confirmed that they use filtering applications including SquidGuard and FortiGuard. The SNB's censorship is selective and often targets articles on government corruption, violations of human rights, and organized crime. Usually, it affects URL-specific pages instead of top-level domain names. Uzbek ISPs block entire Web sites or individual pages upon SNB's unofficial requests. Accessing a blocked page redirects the user to a search engine or to an error message such as 'You are not authorized to view this page.' The retransmission of blocked channels is also prohibited.Profile: Uzbekistan, OpenNet Initiative (December 21, 2010). Organization The SNB is known to have special purpose units \\"Alfa\\", \\"Cobra\\", and \\"Scorpion\\" under its direct command. The Border Service and Customs Service of Uzbekistan answer to the SNB since being placed under its control in 2005. With corruption in the Country being the highest, the organization fully separated itself from the Nation but stays under mafia control. Its duties were recently laid out in a decree by President Mirziyoyev in January 2018.

It is equipped with the following hardware: *EPS: power module *ANTS: antenna management system *COM: communication compartment *PLD: elastic solar cells management sub-system *OBC: main computer *Access port *Elastic solar cells (part of primary mission) *Atmospheric drag device (part of primary mission) *AX.25 transceiver *CW beacon transmitting on 145.901 MHz for tracking by radio amateurs  PW-Sat1 =Mission= PW-Sat1 was launched on 13 February 2012, 10:00 UTC from ELA-1 at Guiana Space Centre (Kourou, French Guiana) aboard the maiden flight of the Vega rocket, together with LARES and ALMASat-1 satellites and 6 other CubeSats built by various European universities.http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/pw-sat-1.htm It was deployed 1 hour 10 minutes into the flight from the P-POD-2 container, along with the ROBUSTA and MaSat-1 CubeSats.http://www.pw-sat.pl/ First signals from satellite were received around 12:10 UTC by radio amateurs. The first Polish reception of PW-Sat1's signals came at 12:15 UTC by CAMK in Warsaw. PW-Sat1 was planned stay in orbit until 2013, when it was planned to perform a destructive atmospheric reentry. The satellite used a large amount of the batteries' stored energy while performing tasks early in the mission. This battery depletion, combined with orbital maneuvers designed so the satellite would fly over Poland, delayed deployment of the tail. Commands of tail deployment were sent from Earth on April and May 2012, but PW-Sat did not respond to the commands. Due to a hardware issue with the communication module (that was discovered on a few other cube sats using the same model) communication with the satellite was problematic and the tail couldn't be extended. PW-Sat1 reentered the atmosphere on 28 October 2014. Development of a successor, PW-Sat2, begun in September 2013 with launch planned for 2017.

The Swedish forces were led by Carl Gustaf Creutz who defeated a larger Russian‚ÄìCossack force under the command of Semjon Nepljujev and Danylo Apostol. Many of the Russian and Cossack regiments participating in the battle were wiped out and ceased to exist as fighting units.The Battle of Kletzk against Swedish Forces. A Journal by S. P. Neplynyev, April 19, 1706. Battle of Kletsk  Prelude  Towards the end of the 17th century Russia, Denmark‚ÄìNorway and Saxony formed a coalition against the Swedish Empire in order to regain territory lost in earlier wars. The Swedish king, Charles XII, then invaded the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in his 1701‚Äì1706 campaign. He forced Augustus the Strong from the Polish throne in 1704, replacing him with pro-Swedish Stanislaw Leszczynski.Tucker, S.C., 2010, A Global Chronology of Conflict, Vol. Two, Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, LLC, page 701 In January 1706 a large force of Russians were cut off and trapped during the battle of Grodno by Charles XII and his similarly sized army. This caused the Russian Czar, Peter the Great, to assemble an army to go to their assistance. He also ordered the Cossack Hetman, Ivan Mazepa ‚Äì who at the time was an ally to Russia ‚Äì to gather an army of 14,000 men to harass and disrupt the Swedish troops blockading Grodno. However, the Swedes launched counter- attacks against the raiding Cossacks which inflicted many casualties. Carl Gustaf Creutz One of these counter-attacks was commanded by Carl Gustaf Creutz. He trapped a substantial number of Cossacks and Poles in the city of Lyakhavichy with his force of 2,000 men and besieged them. In response Mazepa then sent an relief-party of 4,700 soldiers. Initially they had been despatched to help those trapped in Grodno, but they were diverted to Lyakhavichy. After several days march they arrived at the city of Kletsk, some east of Lyakhavichy, where they set up camp. Creutz gained knowledge of this and set off against Kletsk with 1,500 cavalry, leaving 500 dragoons to continue the siege. They marched overnight and arrived at Klatsk the next morning. The battle Immediately on their arrival the Swedes charged a group of Cossacks guarding the bridge crossing the marshes to Kletsk under the command of Danylo Apostol. The Cossacks were quickly overwhelmed and fled in disorder towards the bridge, but were trapped because of wagons blocking their escape route. The Swedes easily finished them off, and hunted down and killed those Cossacks who attempted to escape into the marshes. Danylo Apostol had his horse shot dead during the fighting, but continued to flee on another one before eventually being taken prisoner. Meanwhile, the Russian commander Semjon Nepljujev gathered the troops and artillery in the city and advanced to the assistance of the Cossacks. When he realised that the bridge had been captured he chose to retreat. Four artillery guns were abandoned and captured by the Swedes, who immediately turned them against the retreating Russians. The majority of this retreating force retreated into Kletsk and fortified themselves inside the city. This is where the hardest fighting took place and a Swedish account records: \\"All the walls were scratched by their shots and bullets\\". The Swedes stormed into the city before the disorganised Russians could organise a proper defence. Soon the surviving Russian and Cossack troops were beaten and in full retreat. They ran south and east towards the forest. However, the majority of these were cut down in the fields, while others were drowned in the swamps. The official Swedish record claims the fleeing soldiers had: \\"thrown away most of their clothing and equipment and in barely a shirt tried to save themselves\\".  Aftermath  Letter to Czar Peter from Nepljujev The German mayor of Kletsk, Johan Heinrich Cibinski, later announced that he had counted and buried 2,025 dead Russian or Cossack soldiers lying inside the city of Kletsk, but that there should be at least as many bodies again lying around the outskirts, and in the fields, forests and swamps. The Swedish casualties were 15 killed and 16 wounded. The Russians, however, had lost at least 4,000 men dead and 71 captured, including a Colonel, Petro Pryma. In addition, four cannons, 16 standards and 2,000 horses were lost to the Swedes. On 17 May the Swedish king Charles XII visited the battlefield and noted that the victory was larger than he had initially thought. A bullet wounded Semjon Nepljujev in his arm during the fighting. He later sent a message to the Czar Peter I, in which he claimed the Swedish forces had outnumbered his own, and blamed Ivan Mazepa for having incorrectly calculated the numbers of the Swedes at Lyakhavichy, which he had said did not exceed 800 men. The battle also had a morale effect on the 1,300 soldiers still besieged in Lyakhavichy, who surrendered just days after the return of Creutz and his men with prisoners and captured equipment. The Lyakhavichy fortress was then destroyed. Not long after, Creutz was promoted from colonel to general for his actions. He was later captured in the surrender at Perevolochna, and became a prisoner of war in Russia until 1722; returning home after 13 years in captivity. He then took command of the newly raised Life Regiment of Horse. During that time the Swedish king had died in Norway and the war had ended the year before in 1721. The defences of Kletsk were destroyed by the Swedes and were never rebuilt. The battle of Kletsk was not decisive to the campaign, but it was a significant setback for Czar Peter I and for his soldiers trapped in Grodno. After the Battle of Fraustadt, and now this, the force in Grodno gave up hope of relief and broke out, losing up to 17,000 soldiers dead in the process.Peter Ullgren, Det stora nordiska kriget 1700‚Äì1721 (2008) Stockholm, Prisma. p. 142 References Bibliography *Dictionary of Swedish National Biography, Carl Gustaf Creutz *Slaget vid Kletsk, Arkivcentrum, December 2009, pp. 6‚Äì12 *Oglolbin, N.

It was founded with the intention to publish a diverse set of perspectives on the region, bridging the gap of information available to both those in the Middle East and those elsewhere with a desire to better understand a rapidly changing region. In 2018, Al-Monitor partnered with North Base Media which was founded by Marcus Brauchli and Sasa Vucinic in managing Al-Monitor in order \\"to provide top-level operational and financial decision- making, and work with the company to explore possible content and commercial avenues.\\" thumb At its founding, the site also translated content from countries in the Middle East; however, the site now only provides original content and does not translate from partners.

Spain's reaction to the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence is one of non-recognition, mainly due to concerns about the implications for its own territory. Although it has given indications that its stance may change, increasing political tensions in Catalonia under the current Government of Quim Torra will make it unlikely that Spain will soften its current position. History On 18 February 2008, Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel √Ångel Moratinos said that Spain would not recognise Kosovo because the declaration of independence did not respect international law. He also said that the independence of Kosovo would only be legal if it was the result of agreement by all sides involved or if there had been a UNSC resolution.Spain will not officially recognise Kosovo, News from Spain, 2008-02-18 Spain will not take part in the EULEX mission until legal questions over how it will replace the UN administration are answered. Moratinos told a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Slovenia that Spain will not send its contingent to the EULEX mission until there has been a formal transfer of powers from the UN.Spain Holds Staff From EU Kosovo Mission, Balkan Insight, 2008-03-31 In February 2009, Ambassador of Spain to Serbia √ç√±igo de Palacio Espa√±a said that Spain's position not to recognise Kosovo independence \\"would not change even after the adoption of the resolution by the European Parliament\\" and that \\"Most UN members do not recognize Kosovo's independence. Just 54 of 194 have recognized. The EP resolution is not mandatory and was adopted by a narrow majority, which indicated that there was a division within the institution on the issue of Kosovo's independence\\".Spain, Slovakia reject EP resolution, B92, 2009-02-07 In May 2009 Jos√© Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil, Spanish member of the EU parliament, said that Spain does not recognise Kosovo because of principles related to Spain's Galicia, Basque, and Catalonia autonomous communities. However he also stressed that these Spanish autonomous communities are not comparable with Kosovo which is fundamentally different. Garc√≠a-Margallo said that despite Spain's non-recognition of Kosovo it will continue to support Kosovo and its development.Spanish position visa vi Kosovo, The Kosovo Times, 2009-05-13 On 14 May 2009, Juan Fernando L√≥pez Aguilar, head of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) list for the European Parliament Elections (and former minister of justice), hinted that Spain might recognise Kosovo in the very long run, referring to the development of relations between Spain and Israel.L√≥pez Aguilar no cierra la puerta a un reconocimiento de Kosovo por Espa√±a, ABC ES, 2009-05-14 At the press conference during the 64th Session of the UNGA, the Prime Minister of Spain Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero said that Spain has a consistent position on the question of recognition of the creation of independent States that required the respect of international law and that from Spain's point of view, it was not correct to recognise Kosovo. He stated that Spain will not change its position despite more than 60 countries that recognised and that \\"the question could be the reverse: why are there more than 100 countries that have not recognized Kosovo and why do those 60 not see what the other 100 see?\\".Press Conference by Spain's Prime Minister Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, United Nations, 2009-09-23Spain Will Not Change Position Against Kosovo Independence, Latin American Herald Tribune In March 2012, during a fierce debate between Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Catalan MP and Convergence and Union spokesman Josep Antoni Duran i Lleida, Rajoy stated that he is opposed to the recognition of Kosovo as this is what suits the interests of Spain.Rajoy se opone a reconocer Kosovo porque \\"es lo que conviene al inter√©s general de los espa√±oles\\", La Vanguardia, 2012-03-14 (in Spanish) However, after the arrival of the socialist Pedro Sanchez to the government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that \\"they are working in finding new solutions\\", especially if an agreement between Serbia and Kosovo is reached.

Santa Maria dei Sette Dolori is a Baroque church in Rome built attached to a convent in the rione of Trastevere, located on Via Garibaldi, near the intersection with Via dei Panieri. Construction of the church was begun in 1643 with plans by Francesco Borromini, annexed to an Augustinian nunnery that was founded by Camilla-Virginia Savelli Farnese, Duchess of Latera. However, when the fortunes of the House of Farnese declined, so did the funding for the church, and by 1655 the work was stopped. The convent underwent a number of tribulations during the nineteenth century, however, it was not deconsecrated in 1873, as were many other monasteries. Since then, the nunnery has slowly ebbed and most of the convent is now the Hotel Donna Camilla Savelli. The Diocese presently lists the church as being in the care of the few remaining nuns of the order of Suore Oblate del Santo Bambino Ges√π. The monastery also served as a place to hide Jews from the fascist authorities active in the Holocaust during World War II. The facade of the church remains in brick, deprived of decoration. It has concave front and some odd-shaped windows that underscore Borromini's Baroque idiosyncrasies. The interior still contains some of the marble sculptural decorations plus a St Augustine and the Mystery of the Trinity by Carlo Maratta and a canvas by Marco Benefial.

They have been found as artifacts in archaeological sites in the American Midwest and Southeast. The plates, found as far afield as Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, were instrumental in the development of the archaeological concept known as the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. Some of the more notable examples are representations of raptorial birds and avian-themed dancing warriors. Copper in the Eastern Woodlands Diorama of Anishinaabe people mining copper near Lake Superior Copper trade routes throughout the Eastern Woodlands were established during the Archaic period (3000 - 1000 BCE)Brose et al. (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 28-9 and continued into historic times.Brose et al. (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 149 Copper was usually imported from the Great Lakes region; however other sources of copper have been found elsewhere including in the Appalachian Mountains near the Etowah Site in Alabama.Welch (1991), Moundville's Economy : 184 For generations the Indigenous peoples of North America pursued copper sources and transmitted the skill of copper's manipulation and preparation as a special material for use in elite goods on to their descendants. Elites at major political and religious centers during the Mississippian period used copper ornamentation as a sign of their status by crafting the sacred material into representations connected with the Chiefly Warrior cult of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. These elites used a trade network that spanned most of North America to acquire exotic trade items from far away, trading their own locally manufactured elite goods and materials. After the collapse of the Mississippian way of life in the 1500s with the advent of European colonization, copper still retained a place in Native American religious life as a special material. Copper was traditionally regarded as sacred by many historic period Eastern tribes. Copper nuggets are included in medicine bundles among Great Lakes tribes. Among 19th century Muscogee (Creek), a group of copper plates carried along the Trail of Tears are regarded as some of the tribe's most sacred items. Methods of manufacture Unworked copper nugget The native copper, as well as the technique of cold working it, is believed to have come from the Great Lakes area, hundreds of miles to the north of the Cahokia polity and most other Mississippian culture sites, although the copper workshops discovered near Mound 34 at Cahokia are so far the only copper workshops found at a Mississippian culture archaeological site. Researchers at Northwestern's School of Engineering and Applied Science used an electron microscope to analyze pieces of the flat copper sheets found during excavations at the Mound 34 site at Cahokia. The researchers found that the metal had been repeatedly heated and cooled and while it was softened by the heat, had been hammered, a process known as annealing, similar to how blacksmiths work iron. They were also able to determine that the Cahokian coppersmiths had heated the copper in a wood fire to produce sufficient heat for this process. This process of heating and hammering was repeated over and over until a sheet of the desired thickness was obtained and was sufficient a method to allow the craftsman to work the copper into very thin sheets. Researchers have also tried different techniques to duplicate how larger pieces were manufactured. They determined that the larger pieces had not been laminated together but had most likely been riveted together with small copper knobs. Researchers were also able to determine that the artisans cut the copper into the desired shapes by bending the sheet metal back and forth until it broke in the desired location. Working the prepared copper plate After the flat sheets of copper were produced, designs were then embossed into the surfaces probably with stone, bone or wooden tools. Frank Hamilton Cushing, an anthropologist working in the early 20th century, worked out a method for flattening and embossing the plates. He hammered raw nuggets of copper smooth and removed imperfections by scouring the surface with a piece of sandstone. He was then able to duplicate the avian designs by resting the sheet of copper on a rawhide pad and pressing into the surface using a piece of pointed deer antler and pressing with his chest. This produced a sharp thin line that when the plate was reversed resembled the embossed lines of the aboriginal artifacts. This process is considered to be roughly similar to how Mississippian coppersmiths probably worked. Distribution of avian themed copper plates Iconography =Avian themed plates= Avian themed plates are thought to depict aspects of the Birdman, a major figure in Mississippian iconography closely associated with warfare, ritual dancing, and the game of chunkey. Numerous examples of similar avian themed plates have been found in locations across the Midwest and Southeast, from the large cache found in Malden near the bootheel region in Dunklin County, Missouri to others from Mangum in Mississippi, Spiro in Oklahoma, Etowah in Georgia, Lake Jackson Mounds in Florida and other sites in Missouri, Illinois, and Alabama. Cahokia and the Birdman Birdman burial from Cahokia Years of study by archaeologists, ethnologists and historians of artifacts of different materials found at many sites throughout the midwestern and southeastern United States has led many of these researchers to conclude that the cosmology associated with the avian imagery of this artwork originated at Cahokia (the largest Mississippian culture site, in western Illinois near St Louis, Missouri) between 1100 - 1300 CE. This cosmology was expressed as the \\"Braden style\\", a label applied to ceramics, shell pieces, stone statuary and copper artifacts all bearing the hallmarks and elements of the same sophisticated style. These pieces were exported to other centers where they were emulated by regional craftsman and became the basis of local styles, such as the \\"Craig style\\" of Spiro Mounds, the \\"Hightower style\\" of Etowah Mounds and the \\"Hemphill style\\" of Moundville. Avian imagery occupied a central place in Cahokian iconography, with examples including an incised sandstone tablet with a birdman excavated from Monks Mound and an elaborate elite personage burial in Mound 72 with thousands of shell beads arranged in the shape of a bird. Although no copper plates other than some small fragments have ever been found at Cahokia, it is the only Mississippian culture site to date where a copper workshop has been located by archaeologists. Excavations of the copper workshops at Mound 34, (a small mound located on the Ramey Plaza east of Monks Mound) indicate copper was worked there. The area contains the remains of three tree stumps thought to have been used to hold anvil stones used for beating out the flattened sheets of copper. However, despite the lack of copper plates, one copper artifact has been found at the site. A copper- covered wooden mace by thought to have been part of a headdress was found during surface collections at Cahokia. Several other copper ornaments have been found in nearby locations. =Other themes= Bi-lobed arrow plates from Etowah Many of the hundreds of plates found have not been specifically avian themed and come in a variety of other shapes. These include embossed geometric designs, weeping eye motifs, bi-lobed arrow motif headdresses, head shapes with headresses, and plain sheets. The unique \\"Upper Bluff Lake Dancing Birdmen\\" plate was found in the same burial in Union County, Illinois as a Malden style avian plate.Brose et al. (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 160-1, 213 Several related examples of bi-lobed arrow headdresses have been found at the Etowah Site and the Moundville Site. A variety of non-avian themed plates were found at the Spiro site. These finds include copper feather and flame-like shapes believed to have been part of headdresses, a human head cutout wearing similar \\"feathers\\", square sheets with Forked Eye motifs and concentric circle designs, and several copper covered wooden plaques also with Forked Eye motifs and circles. Known locations =Arkansas plates= Toul Creek plate from northern Arkansas A number of plates have been found in various sites in eastern Arkansas. At least three of the Arkansas examples (Rose Mound, Scott Place, and Clay Hill) and two others (a found in a Dallas Phase burial at the Henry Farm Site (40 LO 53) in Loudon County, Tennessee in 1975 and a specimen unexamined by archaeologists thought to come either from the Neeley's Ferry (3 CS 24) or Rose Mound sites in Cross County) have stylistic similarities that indicate they may have all been made by the same artist. Four of the five were found in the St. Francis River Valley area of Arkansas. Researchers think the five plates may represent a composite creature that is part snake and part hawk as the shape of the tail feathers resemble a rattlesnakes' rattle or that the design may represent a hawk in the act of swallowing a snake. A copper plate found at the Clay Hill Site (3 LE 11) in Lee County, Arkansas has the same chest region design and long narrow shape and distinctive tail feathers as the Scott Site and Rose Mound examples. Although fragmented it is approximately in length. It was recorded to be in a private collection in 1978 but has not been seen since. The plate was found in an Armorel Phase burial that also contained a Clarksdale bell, an item of European manufacture that is a hallmark of the 1541 Hernando de Soto excursion through the southeast. This does not date the era for the production of the plate though as such items were often kept as heirlooms for long periods, even many generations, before they ended up becoming grave goods. In 1910 Clarence Bloomfield Moore found a stylized hawk or eagle plate while excavating graves at the Rose Mound Site (3 CS 27) in Cross County, Arkansas. The plate was and remarkably well preserved, missing only the tip of one wing. The plate is not embossed but merely a shape cut from a flat copper sheet. In the 1970s a copper bird in length was found by looters at the Scott Site (3 MS 24), also known as Big Lake Bridge, in Mississippi County, Arkansas. The specimen was located at the back of the head of an extended adult burial, and may have been bent over the top of the head. Eight plain pottery vessels grave good vessels were found with it. A possible partial avian style plate was found at the Magness Site (3 IN 8) in Independence County, Arkansas along with several engraved shell cups. The plate is a typical head portion with the forked eye, earspool, and elaborate headdress and hairdo known from other examples. As the lower portion of the plate is missing it is impossible to tell if the figure is a dancer or a human headed bird like the Wulfing A plate. A avian themed plate very similar to the Wulfing Plates copper plate was discovered at the Toul Creek Site in Baxter County, Arkansas by several local farmers. The plate was located in the chest area of an extended adult who was also wearing the two limestone ear spools. Other grave goods found in the burial included a marine shell dipper and a chert knife. Its whereabouts are currently unknown. =Etowah and the Rogan plates= Rogan plate, A91117 The Rogan plates were discovered in a stone box grave within Mound C at the Etowah Site by John P. Rogan in the 1880s. Several are very similar to plates later found at Lake Jackson Mounds, and it is believed that the Lake Jackson plates came from Etowah. The designs of the plates are in the Classic Braden style from the Cahokian area, and it is generally thought that some of the plates were manufactured at Cahokia before ending up at sites in the Southeast. The two Rogan plates were interred as a pair and are very similar to one another. The first is approximately and the second . Holes in the plates suggest they were once hung as a decoration. Other plates were found by Warren K. Moorehead at the Etowah site in excavations during the mid-1920s. The other plates are in a slightly different style and indicate that local artisans had begun production of their own copper plates in emulation of the Braden style. These plates, along with artifacts from Spiro and Moundville Archaeological Site were instrumental in the development of the archaeological concept of the S.E.C.C. =Florida plates= Copper Solar Ogee Deity plate found at Lake Jackson Mounds, Florida Although at the periphery of the Mississippian world, Florida has been the site of the discovery many S.E.C.C. associated copper artworks. Archaeologists believe that this is because of the busycon shell trade, the shells being a valuable ritual and high status trade good to Mississippian elites. It has even been proposed that the Fort Walton culture founders of the Lake Jackson Mounds Site moved east and founded the settlement in approximately 1100 CE to strategically position themselves in this trade network. Lake Jackson trade for copper pieces seems to have taken place almost exclusively with the Etowah polity of north central Georgia. When Mound 3 at the site was excavated it yielded fourteen copper plates, deposited in the burial mound sometime between 1300‚Äî1500 CE. The so-called \\"Copper Solar Ogee Deity,\\" a high repouss√© copper plate, depicts the profile of a dancing winged figure, wielding a ceremonial mace in its right hand and a severed head in the left. The extended, curling nose resembles a proboscis and resembles another S.E.C.C. motif, the long- nosed god maskette. The figures elaborate headdress includes a bi-lobed arrow motif and, at the top of the plate, an ogee motif surrounded by a chambered circle. Some art historians have argued that this plate and one of the Rogan plates may represent a female or \\"Birdwoman\\" because the breast on the figure protrudes slightly more than it does on other examples, while others have argued that the plate may represent a third gender or \\"two-spirit\\" tradition.Power (2004), Early Art of the Southeastern Indians : 103 After the collapse of the Etowah polity in approximately 1375 trade continued for the Lake Jackson peoples, albeit now with peoples located in the northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee area. No longer able to get the elaborate copper plates from Etowah, a local style developed, producing a new style of such as that depicted on the \\"Elder Birdman\\" plate, thought to represent the merger of the Birdman corpus with a local solar deity. Further east and south into Florida were non-Mississippian culture peoples who were involved in long-distance trade of local high status items such as busycon shells for gorgets and yaupon holly for the black drink. The Mill Cove Complex is a St. Johns culture site in Duval County, Florida with two sand burial mounds, one platform mound shaped and associated village habitation areas. Clarence Bloomfield Moore excavated the mounds in 1894 and found numerous copper grave goods, including two copper long-nosed god maskettes and 11 copper plates. The one plate found in the Shields Mound was plain, but several of the other 10 found in the Grant Mound were decorated with an oval central boss and ringed with an oval embossed or beaded line. They measured - to -. They had perforated holes for hanging. Archaeologists speculate they were used either for gorgets or headdress ornaments. Analysis of the metal in the plaques has connected them to locations in the Great Lakes region, Wisconsin and the Appalachian Mountains. Timucua wearing embossed metal gorgets ca. 1562 A little further down the Atlantic coast was the Mount Royal Mound (8 PU 35), a site occupied on and off since 4000 BCE, and during the historic period a Timucua settlement. Construction of the mound at Mount Royal, began in approximately 1050 CE. In 1893 and 1894, Clarence B. Moore excavated the mound. Among the copper ornaments he disinterred, Moore discovered a copper breast-place with a \\"forked eye and blade image\\", and another plate with concentric circles and lines. The first plate was almost square and the second plate was square. Located in central Florida, the Old Okahumpka Site (8 LA 57) is a now destroyed burial mound in Lake County, Florida near the modern town of Okahumpka. The site was excavated by Clarence B. Moore in the 1890s. During his excavation he found a burial associated plate measuring wide by in length and depicting the lower portion of a dancing figure wearing a sash, kilt, cuffed moccasins, and holding a knife. The design is almost identical to two examples known from Spiro and a site in Jackson County, Alabama, although of the three it is the only one to show a figure wielding a knife. Archaeologists estimate the plate was deposited in the mound sometime between 1100 and 1300 CE. The plate is now part of the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian. From an unknown location on the west coast of central Florida comes the Wilcox plate, a partial avian themed copper plate showing the middle section details of scalloped wings, tail feathers and a raptors leg and claw in the Malden style very similar to the Wulfing plates. It was discovered somewhere near Waldo, Florida in Levy County in the 1880s, where it was purchased from a local doctor by Joseph Wilcox for the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. It has been part of the collection of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology since the mid-1930s. =Illinois plates= Upper Bluff Lake Dancing Birdmen plate Outside of Cahokia, Illinois has seen the discovery of many Mississippian culture copper items including copper maces, ear spools, several avian plates, a wooden copper covered mask (known as the Emmons mask), and headdress pieces. Three copper plates have been found, one of them been identified as being from the same workshop as the Wulfing plates and others as having stylistic similarities with the Wulfing, Spiro and Etowah plates. The Edwards falcon plate is a by copper avian plate found at the Material Service Quarry Site in La Salle County, Illinois. Before it was deposited as a grave good it had its head riveted on in the reverse position. It is one of several plates found in Illinois believed to have been made by the same workshop as the Malden plates. The Peoria Falcon is a unique avian plate found in 1856 on the shore of Peoria Lake. It is a by copper plate depicting a naturalistic peregrine falcon. It is part of the collection of the National Museum of Natural History, but it is on long-term loan to the Lakeview Museum of Arts and Sciences in Peoria, Illinois where it is on display. The Upper Bluff Lake plates are two plates found at the Saddle Site (11U284) in Union County, Illinois in the 1880s, in the same stone box grave. One of the plates is avian themed and the other a unique double birdman design, but still within the corpus of the S.E.C.C. The Upper Bluff Lake falcon plate is a by avian themed Wulfing style plate. It has a mostly intact tail, which the Malden plates do not, and has helped archaeologists understand what the tails of the other pieces would have looked like. The Dancing Figures plate is a rectangular by plate depicting two Birdman figures holding ceremonial chipped flint maces, possibly dancing, and shielding themselves from a possible liquid or ropelike motif falling from the top center of the plate. Stylistically the Dancers plate has been linked to the Classic Braden style associated with Cahokia and it bears stylistic similarities to Craig A style shell objects found at the Spiro site. Both the plates date from 1100 to 1300 CE. Both of the Upper Bluff Lake plates are now in the collection of the National Museum of Natural History. =Malden plates or the Wulfing cache= Human headed avian Malden Plate A The plates of the Wulfing cache, named after an early owner, were discovered by a farmer named Ray Groomes while plowing a field south of Malden in Dunklin County, Missouri in 1906.Brose et al. (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 213 The eight plates, made in the Late Braden style associated with Cahokia, are thought to date to the late 13th or early 14th century. The Wulfing plates depict raptors and one bird-human hybrids, ranging human heads to raptor's heads to double-headed raptors on stylized bird's bodies, with naturalistic bird's claws.Brose et al. (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 164-6 The plates were found buried in a field with no known local mounds or village sites. They had been considerably used prior to their burial, as each plates shows multiple episodes of aboriginal repair work including patch repairs and riveted cracks. The eight plates are designated Plates A-H. Plate A, the only anthropomorphic human headed avian in the Wulfing cache, measures in length by in width and weighs . Many similar plates found in other states are now believed to have come from the same workshop, if not the same artist, as the Wulfing cache. The sites of the discovery of these other plates span the United States from central Florida to northern Illinois to Oklahoma, and include the Upper Bluff Lake falcon plate, the Toul Creek plate, the Reed Mound plate, the Edwards plate, and the Wilcox plate, as well as showing stylistic links to plates found in burials at Etowah and Spiro. =Spiro plates= Anthropomorphic human headed avian plate from Spiro Spiro Mounds is a Caddoan Mississippian culture archaeological site located in present-day LeFlore County, Oklahoma. In the 1930s the only burial mound at the site, the Craig Mound, was looted by locals who used dynamite on the mound to gain access to its interior. Once inside the high and wide cavity the looters discovered almost perfectly preserved fragile artifacts made of wood, conch shell, fabric of vegetal and animal fibers, lace, fur, feathers and copper. The Great Mortuary, as the hollow interior has since become known to archaeologists, was a burial structure for Spiro's rulers. It was created as a circle of sacred cedar posts sunk in the ground and angled together at the top like a tipi. The cone-shaped chamber was covered with layers of earth to create the mound, and it never collapsed. Minerals percolating through the mound hardened the chamber's log walls, making them resistant to decay and shielding the perishable artifacts inside from direct contact with the earth. No other Mississippian mound has been found with such a hollow space inside it or with such large and distinctive collection of preserved artifacts. Among the grave goods were numerous copper pieces, including ear-spools, , copper sheathed wooden knives and 265 repouss√© plates. One of the more famous of these copper plates depicts a man's head, possibly severed, in profile, with a Forked Eye motif, an ear-spool, and hair styled into an occipital hair knot from which a single feather projects.Brose et al. (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 142-3 The plate measures by .Brose et al. (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 211 Another of the plates is the avian themed \\"naturalistic hawk cutout\\", which measures in width. The plate shows stylistic similarities with the Wulfing plates. Some of the other repouss√© copper pieces found include eight examples of copper \\"feathers\\" that were worn as hair ornaments. Many of the plates found at Spiro are in the \\"Braden Style\\" and are thought by archaeologists to have been imported from Cahokia. =Other locations= Reconstruction of the plate found at Mangum Besides the Spiro site, four other plates have been found during excavations at Caddoan Mississippian sites. The Reed Mound in Oklahoma produced a fragmentary Malden style plate thought to be from the same workshop as the Wulfing set. Three other plates were found at the Gahagan Mounds Site in Red River Parish, Louisiana in the early 20th century, along with numerous other copper objects including copper covered ear spools and a matched set of large copper long-nosed god maskettes. The plates were large rectangular plaques embossed with concentric circles or squaresFundaburk, Sun Circles and Human Hands : 107-108 and are similar to the Mount Royal plates from Florida. A matching pair of large thin sheet copper cutout human hands were also found at Gahagan. Two plates were found in a Plaquemine culture site in Mississippi. Three fragments of a repouss√© plate with an avian design were found in a burial in the Mangum Mound Site in Claiborne County, Mississippi in 1936 by a farmer who owned the site. When pieced together the plate was about in width and weighed a total of . The plate had been reinforced and riveted in several places to protect weak spots in the metal. A second plate was found during archaeological excavations at the site in 1963. The Mangum plates stylistically resemble the Rogan plates from Etowah. Other copper items Copper earspools from Spiro Besides the repouss√© copper plates, Mississippian people also created copper axes, knives, gorgets, beads, and fishhooks, as well as wooden beads and ear spools covered in copper.Welch (1991), Moundville's Economy : 69, 168 Long-nosed god maskettes, a special kind of ear ornamentation, are sometimes found made of copper. Copper examples have been found at the Gahagan Mounds Site in Louisiana and at the Grant Mound in Florida, each of which produced two of the earpieces. Several copper covered cedar knives were found in the Great Mortuary mound at Spiro. Several matching pairs were found, although of slightly differing lengths, ranging up to long. One set had Weeping eye motifs repouss√©d into the copper sheathing. A variety of copper and copper covered items have been found at the Moundville Archaeological Site in Alabama, although no copper plates have been found there. Moundville copper artifacts generally consist of copper covered ear spools and tear drop shaped pendants thought to represent trophy scalps. A unique copper piece was discovered at the Emmons Cemetery Site in Fulton County, Illinois. It is a wooden by by copper covered object shaped like a human face with a crenelated crown-like decoration on its forehead. It resembles the small human face that makes up part of the headdress of Malden plate A (including the distinctive crenelated crown-like structure) and archaeologists believe it was in fact part of a real headdress.

Background  The Spectrum Task Force was put in place to increase the efficiency of the use of the radio spectrum. In the beginning Federal Communications Commission was in complete control of the radio spectrum. It was the central authority that decided who gets what block of the spectrum with no charge and what use it would be put to. While this approach was effective, it was limited in a way that its exclusive nature was meant for technology that is dated now. Federal Communications Commission also approached alternative spectrum governance regimes for spectrum management like common spectrums and spectrum property rights model which have their own limitations and drawbacks. Spectrum Task Force was put in place to overlook all these regimes and use a method that encourage the highest and best use of spectrum domestically and internationally in order to provide the growth and rapid deployment of innovative and efficient communications technologies and services. Former FCC Chairman Michael Powell said, \\"The government has an almost impossible task trying to keep pace with the ever increasing demand for spectrum and continuing advances in wireless technology and applications. In this fast-moving world, the Commission cannot rely on outmoded procedures and policies. We must establish new ways to support innovation and the efficient, flexible use of spectrum. While the Spectrum Policy Task Force has a difficult task ahead of it, I am pleased that it is making significant progress and that it is moving forward with a work plan.\\" Principal SPTF Recommendations The core focus of the Spectrum Policy Task Force is to ensure the efficient and effective use of the radio spectrum. The radio spectrum currently being used plays a vital role in a vast amount of government and commercial services. These services include radio and television broadcasts, satellite communications, wireless networks, public safety communications, weather forecasting, etc. The radio spectrum is the section of the electromagnetic spectrum that spans from about 3 kilohertz to 300 gigahertz. Television broadcasts, radios, mobile phones, and military and government communication systems are best operated in the 100 MHZ to 3GHz radio spectrum. The current use of the spectrum is mostly focused on the lower 1% of these frequencies. With the gradual increases in technological innovation and wireless communication, the usable part of the radio spectrum has also been greatly expanded. From here on, there will only be gradual increases in the technology and devices that depend on the radio spectrum for their functionality. The National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA) deals with radio spectrum policies on the international level as well as federal government use of the radio spectrum. The allocation of the radio spectrum differs around the globe, but since electromagnetic waves travel the same way through the air, spectrum management decisions are generally coordinated internationally. The Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) primary focus is on all the nonfederal, state, and local governments' use of the spectrum. To manage the spectrum, both the NTIA and FCC used the \\"command-and-control\\" approach; they dictated how each segment of the radio spectrum is used and who is eligible to use it. The command-and-control approach worked in the initial days of wireless communication, but in order to meet the needs of new technology innovations and modern mobile devices using wireless communication, a policy was required that was more consumer-oriented. The FCC formed a task force‚Äîthe Spectrum Policy Task Force‚Äîwhose primary role was to evaluate changes in the spectrum policy, ensure the efficient and effective use of the spectrum, and derive public benefit from the use of the spectrum. =Command- and-Control and Market-oriented Rights Models= The command-and-control approach dictates how the radio spectrum will be segmented and which consumers will be eligible to use it. In the United States, the FCC is the centralized authority that regulates spectrum allocation and use. So far, the command-and- control approach has been the most commonly used method for spectrum management. Over the past decade, there has been a substantial increase in the technological innovations, mobile devices, and wireless services that use the radio spectrum. The command-and-control approach was useful for addressing the issues related to older wireless communication devices and services. With the new technologies and their increased demand for the radio spectrum, the command-and-control approach was simply at a disadvantage for spectrum management. In October 2001, Chairman Michael Powell, the FCC Chairman at that time, shared the difficulties that the government officials were experiencing when it came to the allocation and alignment of the radio spectrum to address the new emerging spectrum needs and services. In June 2002, the FCC Chairman established the Spectrum Policy Task Force to assist the FCC in evaluating changes in the spectrum, reevaluating the command-and-control approach, and helping to migrate it to a more consumer-oriented model. The command-and- control approach comprises the duties of allocating and segmenting the spectrum for specific types of services, e.g. radio, and ensuring that the services that use these bands adopt the service rules and technical standards. command-and-control also requires that the equipment from the major federal systems that use the spectrum be certified by the NTIA in order to evaluate the impact of the system on the spectrum. The certification includes properly researching the system, selecting the frequency bands used by the system, and then filing for review by the NTIA for federal systems. (The FCC reviews non- federal systems.) After the certification process is complete and the technical standards have been authorized, a portion of the radio spectrum is allocated to the individual entity or service provider and its use is allowed within a certain geographical area. Lastly, the command-and-control approach requires the NTIA and FCC to have proper measures in place to monitor the allocated spectrum, address any interference issues, keep the technical standards in check, and audit the geographic spectrum assignments. The goal from here onward was to create a more consumer-oriented model that would encourage the optimum use of the spectrum, lead growth in technological innovations, and provide effective and efficient communication technologies and services. Spectrum Policy Objectives The core objectives of the task force are to ensure the efficient and effective use of the radio spectrum, encourage the best use of the spectrum domestically and internationally, encourage the growth of innovative and efficient communication technologies and services, and promote the deployment of spectrum technologies and services domestically and internationally. =Implement flexible market-oriented spectrum allocation= The Spectrum Policy Task Force will encourage the most effective and efficient use of the radio spectrum, increase the opportunities for new technological innovations, and ensure that there is ample spectrum available and allocated for public safety, commercial, and other communication services. The Spectrum Policy Task Force will evaluate and identify changes in spectrum policy and provide recommendations that will maximize public benefits gained from the use of the radio spectrum. The Task Force will also advise the FCC on the evaluation and refinement of spectrum assignment policies, which are not limited to the auction process. Spectrum auction is an auction process set up by the government to sell the rights to spectrum bands. Since radio spectrum is a scarce resource, the government uses the auction method to promote market-oriented spectrum management. =Efficient and effective use of the spectrum= The Spectrum Policy Task Force will ensure that the radio spectrum is being used efficiently and effectively. It will provide the FCC with recommendations to promote the efficient use of the spectrum by establishing the shared use of the spectrum between applicable users and service providers, building new license models that minimize the entry barriers for consumers to own spectrum bands, lessening the interference in spectrum bands, and encouraging new technological innovations like Internet- based protocols and cognitive radios. The following is the FCC's summary of its Secondary Markets Initiative: Markets Initiative \\"The FCC is taking significant steps to remove regulatory barriers and facilitate the development of secondary markets in spectrum usage rights among the Wireless Radio Services. In 2003, the FCC adopted its first Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, in which it established new policies and procedures to facilitate broader access to valuable spectrum resources through the use of spectrum leasing arrangements. It also streamlined procedures for approving license assignments and transfers of control. In 2004, the FCC adopted the Second Report and Order, Order on Reconsideration, and Second Further Notice, in which it provided for immediate processing of certain qualifying spectrum leasing and license assignment and transfer transactions. It also established the new regulatory concept, termed the 'private commons,' to provide additional access to spectrum in licensed bands. Finally, the FCC is seeking comment on additional steps it should take to further the development of advanced technologies that enable more efficient secondary markets in spectrum usage rights\\". . =Maximizing Spectrum Flexibility= The Spectrum Policy Task Force will advise ways to maximize the flexibility of the spectrum. \\"Flexibility\\" means granting both licensed and unlicensed users maximum freedom to access the spectrum when they can ensure that they are generating the highest value from their spectrum use. The flexibility of the spectrum offers autonomy only when the various spectrum users ensure that their use of the spectrum will not cause spectrum interference. Flexibility will give spectrum users the power to determine how best they will use their spectrum. From the FCC SPTF report of 2002: By leaving these choices to the spectrum user, this approach tends to lead to efficient and highly valued spectrum uses. In most instances, a flexible use approach is preferable to the Commission's traditional \\"command-and-control\\" approach to spectrum regulation, in which allowable spectrum uses are limited based on regulatory judgments. The Spectrum Policy Task Force will also recommend approaches to the FCC that allow licensed and unlicensed users flexibility of the spectrum and ensure that they comply with the technical rules regarding the use of different technical devices, power limits, interference rules, etc. Spectrum Policy Task Force Findings and Recommendations The function of the task force is to gather preliminary data and, based on the data, provide the FCC with recommendations. Some of major findings identified by the Spectrum Policy Task Force include: =Radio spectrum interference tolerance= It is important to enable changes in the spectrum policy that will create potential for new radio systems that will use the spectrum more efficiently and are more tolerant to spectrum interference. =Quantify spectrum use= Preliminary data gathered by Spectrum Policy Task Force shows that a majority of the radio spectrum is not in use for a significant period of time. The use of the white spaces between the spectrums can be increased significantly. White spaces are the spectrum bands that exist between the used channels to minimize interference. Compared to the old analog signals, multiple digital signals can be packed into the spectrum band, allowing more transmissions. By allowing the use of new technologies and radio systems, this white space can be used more efficiently. =Regulatory models for both licensed and unlicensed users= The Spectrum Policy Task Force recommends flexibility of the spectrum for licensed and unlicensed users. Along with giving users the autonomy to make good use of the spectrum, the FCC should have clear regulations in place so that users can understand and comply with these rules, e.g. power limits and interference protection. =No single regulatory model should be applied to all spectrums= With Spectrum Task Force recommendations, the FCC should pursue a regulatory model that provides a balanced spectrum policy. The policy should include granting spectrum usage rights based on market-oriented model, which will promote more open access while using command and control regulations in limited circumstances. \\"The Task Force recommended that FCC pursue a spectrum management policy that includes both exclusive spectrum usage rights granted through market-based mechanisms and creates open access to spectrum 'commons,' with command-and- control regulation used in limited circumstances.\\"  Reference List  Category:Federal Communications Commission ","title":"Spectrum Task Force"},{"id":"35719172","text":"Chaetotrechiama procerus is a species of beetle in the family Carabidae, the only species in the genus Chaetotrechiama.

Catalogue of lifeGlobal Species Etymology The species name schoenherri honours the Swedish entomologist Carl Johan Sch√∂nherr. Distribution This species can be found in New Guinea Description Eupholus (schoenherri) petiti is usually metallic bright blue- green, with four transverse unequally spaced black shining bands on elytra. The last band is strongly arched. Antennae are club-shaped, it has a longitudinal groove on the vertex and the extremity of thighs is blue.

Beck was born at Freiburg im Breisgau, and entered the army of the Austrian Empire in 1848. He distinguished himself as chief-of-staff of an infantry division at the Battle of Magenta, and in 1863 was made personal aide-de-camp to the Emperor. He held this position, with that of adjutant-general and chief of the imperial military chancery until 1881, winning the Emperor's confidence and exercising the greatest influence on all military questions. In 1866 he acted as the Emperor's confidential agent at the headquarters of Feldzeugmeister Ludwig von Benedek, before and after the Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz, and his advice was of great importance, though it was not always followed. In 1878 he was entrusted with a similar mission to the commander-in-chief of the troops operating in Bosnia. In 1881 he was made chief of the general staff of the Imperial and Royal army, a position which he occupied until 1906. Not only was his advice listened to in military affairs, but he frequently exercised great influence on important political and personal questions, gaining a great reputation throughout the monarchy as one of its most influential men. His clear judgment and practical common-sense enabled him to see and judge men and things from a purely objective standpoint. He retired at the age of 77, and was appointed commander of the Imperial Guard. Notes References * Further reading *Scott W. Lackey.

Grimm's father was Wilhelm Grimm (1786-1859), and his uncle Jakob Grimm (1785-1863), the philologist compilers of indigenous folk tales (\\"Brothers Grimm\\"). His other uncle was the painter engraver Ludwig Emil Grimm (1790-1863). Herman Grimm is believed to have had only one (known) child at a young age, Martin Grimm. From 1841 Herman attended the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium in Berlin. He belonged to a clique associated with Bettina von Arnim (1785-1859), wife of the late poet Achim von Arnim (1781-1831), and started publishing drama and novels. He began legal and philological studies at the universities of Berlin and Bonn. In 1857 he visited Rome where the artistic circle of Peter von Cornelius brought his interests to art. In 1859, he married Gisela von Arnim (1827-1889), the Arnim's daughter, and published his treatise, Die Akademie der K√ºnste und das Verh√§ltni√ü der K√ºnstler zum Staate. His short-lived periodical, √ºber K√ºnstler und Kunstwerke (1864-1867), published many important essays. It also contained some of the first photographic illustrations of art in a magazine. The first volume of his biography of Michelangelo, Das Leben Michelangelos, began appearing in 1868. He wrote his dissertation in 1868 from Leipzig and his habilitation (1870) in Berlin. In 1871 he weighed in on the Hans Holbein \\"Meyer Madonna\\" debate concluding against the sound reasoning of the \\"Holbein convention\\" of eminent scholars, that the Dresden version was the autograph one. He accepted the chair in the newly created discipline of history of art (Lehrstuhl f√ºr Kunstgeschichte) in Berlin in 1872 and remained there the rest of his life. Grimm published the first (though incomplete) edition of his Das Leben Raphaels in 1872. Grimm's art history writing is characteristic of the period consolidation of standards following unification of Germany, known as the Gr√ºnderzeit. When Friedrich Waagen, for example, criticized in the early issues of the Zeitschrift f√ºr bildende Kunst, Goethe's aesthetic taste of some fifty years before, Grimm, the spokesman for the Gr√ºnderzeit, took it personally, refuting Waagen effectively point by point. Grimm's Beitr√§ge zur deutschen Culturgeschichte, essays about important cultural personalities, appeared in 1897. Throughout his life his biographies passed through numerous editions. At his death he was succeeded by Heinrich W√∂lfflin. His students included Alfred Lichtwark; Julius Meier-Graefe studied under him but did not receive a degree. Grimm's reputation is that of the arch-Romantic, Gr√ºnderzeit art historian. He viewed himself as the intellectual successor of Goethe. His approach to art history was through the \\"Great Masters\\", and arranging significance of art through a biographical account of art history. His tastes both typified and led German and continental bourgeois taste. Homer, Dante and Shakespeare were the great writers of their age; in art, only Raphael and Michelangelo could compare. The nineteenth century's adoration of Raphael is in large part Grimm's doing. W√∂lfflin wrote that Grimm showed indifference to all but the very great. This approach to art history is shared by other historians of his time, including Carl Justi, but was personally savaged in the lectures of Anton Springer. Grimm was one of the first to carefully study reception theory, though this aspect of his work is seldom considered. In the 3rd edition of his life of Raphael (1896) he added a section on Rezeptionsgeschichte. Perhaps because formal analysis and the sanctity of viewing the original work of art mattered so little to him, he was among the first to use lantern slides (reproductive images) in his lectures. Grimm's writings were gradually supplanted by superior scholarship in the twentieth century. His emotional approach to art-historical debate, as evidenced by the Holbein Madonna incident, proved his allegiances were usually closer to nationalism than art history. In Germany, his concept of the [German] hero as a mover of history was embraced by the Nazis, who saw to it that new and repackaged versions of his writings, such as Vom Geist der Deutschen (1943), appeared up until the war's end.

Despite the worldwide fame of her Pippi illustrations, Vang Nyman did not receive as much recognition from the publication as author Astrid Lindgren, and remains fairly unknown.  Biography  Ingrid Vang Nyman (born Ingrid Vang Lauridsen) was born in Vejen in southern Jylland, Denmark. Born to a family of intellectuals, Vang Nyman was encouraged to learn and study independently. Following preparatory study at seventeen, she studied for a couple of years at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen from the age of nineteen. However, she did not enjoy her time there and ended her studies early. While at the Academy, she met the painter, cartoonist, and lyricist Arne Nyman, whom she married in 1940 and had a son with named Peder. They moved to Stockholm in 1942, and her marriage to Arne Nyman dissolved within a few years. Vang Nyman produced many of her most significant illustrations between 1945 and 1952. This includes her illustrations from Pippi Longstocking, published in 1945 by Rab√©n and Sj√∂gren. Vang Nyman settled in Copenhagen in 1954. She struggled with many illnesses, both physical and psychological, and committed suicide in 1959.  Style  Although Vang Nyman was a children‚Äôs book illustrator, she believed that illustrations for children should be of high artistic quality just as illustrations for adults. She was well versed in various printing methods and her illustrations feature fields of bright colour separated by bold contour lines. While some of her illustrations did have shading, Vang Nyman never drew shadows.  Career  While known primarily just for her Pippi Longstocking illustrations, her debut as a children‚Äôs book illustrator came the year before her collaboration with Astrid Lindgren. She illustrated a few textbooks for Lindgren as well as some books by other authors including Pearl S. Buck. Vang Nyman did not travel much in her life, but she held a fascination for other cultures, and particularly with children from China, Africa, India, and beyond. She created a series of lithographs intended for use either in a children‚Äôs geography book or along with editorial pieces about the cultures depicted in them. In 1948, they were published in a set of prints titled Children in East and West. The lithographs showed a great attention to detail and knowledge of the cultures Vang Nyman was representing. It is possible that Vang Nyman‚Äôs fascination with these cultures also influenced her style in other illustrations, as the flatness of her compositions and the bright blocks of colour could be said to resemble Japanese woodblock prints. Due to Vang Nyman‚Äôs awareness of her skill as an artist and that she felt undervalued for the work she did, she demanded high and sometimes unrealistic payment in an attempt to gain acknowledgement. This sometimes caused problems between Vang Nyman and the publisher. However, it would seem that there were no issues between Vang Nyman and Astrid Lindgren, as Lindgren said of Vang Nyman; \\"Every author who has been fortunate enough to find a congenial illustrator for their book, would be eternally grateful to that artist\\".

Early life  Giuseppe Archinto was born in Milan on 17 April 1651 (or on 7 May according to other sources). He studied under the Jesuits in the College of Brera in Milan. In 1665 he entered in the Pontifical Roman Seminary in Rome. Later he studied for two years in University of Ingolstadt in Germany. He lived also one year in Vienna and took the opportunity to visit also Hungary, Denmark, France, England and Spain. Returned in Italy, he earned a doctorate in utroque iure at the University of Pavia on 14 September 1675 and became a lawyer. In this period he moved to Rome where he entered in the administration of the Papal States: in 1679 he became protonotary apostolic, and in 1683 he became referendary of the Tribunals of the Apostolic Signature. From 1679 to 1683 he served as Vice- legate of Bologna. During this service in one occasion he escaped from Bologna alarmed by the heavy expenses he had to bear: however pope Innocent XI not only forgave him, but appointed him titular archbishop of Thessalonica on 18 March 1686. His episcopal consecration was conferred in Rome on 31 March 1686 by Cardinal Flavio Chigi. Following his appointment as titular bishop, in April 1686 he was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany where he served up December 1689. Then he was moved to the nunciature to the Republic of Venice where he remained up to January 1696. From Venice he was sent as Nuncio to the Kingdom of Spain where he remained until August 1700. In Spain he suggested to Charles II of Spain to appoint as successor Philip, Duke of Anjou of the French House of Bourbon. Archbishop of Milan On 18 May 1699 Giuseppe Archinto was appointed Archbishop of Milan, however he entered in Milan only on 24 July 1700 due to his ongoing diplomatic services. On 14 November 1699 he was appointed Cardinal Priest of Santa Prisca. He participated to the 1700 papal conclave. The his episcopate overlapped with the War of the Spanish Succession, and even if Archinto was himself a supporter of the Spanish rule over the Duchy of Milan, he had in 1706 to welcome Prince Eugene of Savoy who conquered the North-East Italy for the Holy Roman Empire coalition, thus starting the transition from the Spanish to the Habsburg government of Milan. Archinto in 1708 and again in 1711 imposed an extraordinary taxation on the diocese in order to financially support the Holy Roman Empire coalition. As archbishop he focused on the instruction of the clergy, he required (1703) a further examination in front of himself to all candidates to the holy orders, he ordered a census of the wills in favor of the clergy and imposed to the parish priests the teaching of the catechism every Sunday. He died in Milan on 9 April 1712. His remains were buried in the Archinto Chapel in the North transept of the Cathedral of Milan, near the sepulcher of his predecessor Filippo Archinto.

De Vialar was born 3 years after the Reign of Terror, in the same year as Pope Pius VI was taken prisoner by French troops. She was the oldest of 3 children and was baptized in secret. At a young age, de Vialar was taught by her mother how to read. At the age of thirteen she went to the Parisian college of the Abbaye- au-Bois Ladies, for young ladies of quality, accompanied by her mother, who became ill on the long journey. Despite the best efforts of de Vialar's father, on 17 September 1810 her mother died at the age of 35. At the age of fifteen, De Vialar returned to Gaillac to live with her father and two younger brothers. She found that her father, overwhelmed with grief had relinquished management of the household to Toinon, a devoted but autocratic servant.Agasso, Domenico. \\"Sant 'Emilia de Vialar\\", Famiglia Cristiana In her attempts to help the poor, the old and the destitute, de Vialar invited them to the house, causing considerable tension in the household. Other young women joined her efforts. In 1832 her maternal grandfather left her an inheritance, with which she bought a house for herself and her companions. Inspired by Matthew 1:20, where an angel appeared to Joseph to reassure him: \\"Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary, your bride, because what is generated in her comes from the Holy Spirit,\\" and with the help of the bishop of Albi, Fran√ßois-Marie de Gauly, on Christmas, de Vialar and three other women established the congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Apparition. Her brother Agostino lived in French Algeria and proposed to open a hospital in Boufarik, near Algiers. De Vialar and her first companions arrived at a time of an outbreak of cholera. She used the money her grandfather left her to open hospitals and schools. De Vialar and 17 other sisters received a formal approval for the rule of congregation in 1835. However, in 1843 the bishop of Algiers had all the nuns return to France. De Vialar left France to establish schools and hospitals in Cyprus, Tripoli, and Beirut. In 1845, de Vialar was on her way from Tunisia to Algeria when the ship on which she was traveling was caught in a terrible storm for nine days. De Vialar vowed ‚Äúthat wherever they landed safe and sound, she would open a house and dedicate it to St Paul‚Äù. The ship came to rest at Malta, where St. Paul had also been shipwrecked.

In 1995 he was sentenced by a Glasgow court to ten years' imprisonment for his role in the gun-running. Initially serving his sentence in Scotland, where he had been tried, Robb was eventually transferred to HMP Maghaberry where he left the UVF and declared his allegiance to the breakaway Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) which had been founded by Wright after he and his Portadown unit had been stood down by the UVF Brigade Staff on 2 August 1996. He changed in his physical appearance from being conservative and clean-cut to \\"someone who looked like a shaven-headed, muscle-bound thug\\". According to the Daily Record during his spells in HMP Perth and HMP Barlinnie Robb established himself as one of the main drug dealers in both prisons. Robb's conviction was used by Colin Duffy's lawyer Rosemary Nelson to get her client's life sentence overturned, with the evidence provided by Robb ruled to be unreliable. Nelson argued that Robb had been dishonest and therefore unreliable as he had consistently denied any knowledge of the UVF and yet had been under surveillance by the security forces for some time for his work on behalf of that organisation in Scotland where he had settled after the Duffy trial.The Rosemary Nelson Inquiry Report, The Stationery Office, 2011, p. 39 Post-release Under the terms of the Belfast Agreement he was released from prison early in 1999. Robb was the first LVF-aligned prisoner to be released under the terms of the Agreement. Returning to Scotland following his release, Robb married barmaid Margaret McClean in Gretna Green and settled in the country. He moved with his family to Airdrie and worked as a gardener. Robb had briefly worked on a building site but had been fired after Catholic co-workers complained about his loyalist tattoos, whilst he also saw himself banned from Ibrox Park, the home of Rangers F.C., after spitting at a rival fan and shouting sectarian abuse at Celtic F.C. striker Pierre van Hooijdonk. In 2000 he applied for a place in Stirling University although he was refused entry when his paramilitary past came to light.\\"Our neighbours show hatreds alive and well\\" Belfast Telegraph 23 April 2011 Retrieved 4 May 2012 In 2000 Robb gave an interview to the Sunday Herald in which he claimed the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) had colluded with loyalists to ensure the imprisonment of Duffy. He claimed that the RUC had approached the UVF in Lurgan asking them to provide a fake witness who would testify that Duffy had been at the scene of Lyness's murder. He added that he had been paid ¬£2000 by the RUC for providing the testimony as well as a weapon for personal protection.Terrorist claims ignite probe into paramilitary collusion Robb's claims were endorsed by senior figures within the UVF, who confirmed that they were keen to get rid of Duffy and felt that the deal implied that the police would \\"go easy\\" on the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade. As well as this work for Special Branch, Robb was also said to have been an agent for MI5 with the codename \\"Applejuice\\", and was alleged to have been sympathetic towards neo-Nazism. The judge at his trial, Lord Sutherland had described Robb as the \\"spider at centre of a web of intrigue\\". Death Robb died at the end of 2005 after being stabbed in what was described as a \\"frenzied attack\\" in the east end of Glasgow.Former gun-runner dies in attack Robb had been waiting in his Ford Fiesta car on Gartloch Road in the Ruchazie area outside an off-licence when he was subjected to what Strathclyde Police investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Alan Buchanan described as a \\"vicious\\" attack. The assault was witnessed by many people in the area at the time including children. Robb had tried to run away, screaming out \\"Help me, help me, I'm dying\\" as he vainly attempted to ward off the knife-wielding attacker who tripped him up, and then stabbed him 22 times as he lay on the ground. His body was found dumped around half a mile away from where the attack initially occurred. The killing took place at 5:30 pm on 31 December 2005. Robb was rumoured to have been carrying a substantial sum of money at the time he was killed. According to a local resident, it had been a robbery gone wrong, with Robb \\"known for flashing his cash\\". Glasgow native Brian Tollett appeared in court the following January charged with killing Robb.Man accused of ex-loyalist murder Tollett, a 29-year-old former soldier with the Royal Fusiliers who had served in the Balkans and who claimed to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result, was found guilty of culpable homicide and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. The court determined that Tollett had killed Robb after the two fought over a ¬£140 drug debt and that Robb had been stabbed as part of a physical struggle between the two men.Seven years for loyalist killing References Category:1967 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Progressive Unionist Party politicians Category:Ulster Volunteer Force members Category:Loyalist Volunteer Force members Category:Loyalists imprisoned during the Northern Ireland conflict Category:People murdered in Scotland Category:People from Lurgan ","title":"Lindsay Robb"},{"id":"35719546","text":"Kastav Film Festival is an international film festival founded in 2009.

He is recognisably one of the premier architects in Portuguese history (where he developed most of his work), responsible for several World Heritage buildings. He was a Spanish-Portuguese master builder and architect originally from Cantabria (former Kingdom of Castile; present-day Spain), who developed his mature career in Portugal, where he settled in c.1508. He is considered the greatest Portuguese architect of the 16th century and one of the greatest in Renaissance Europe. Trained in the gothic style, his activity made its mark during the Manueline period, after which he played a decisive role in affirming the Renaissance style in Portugal. Jo√£o de Castilho was one of the major protagonists of a decise shift towards classicism. His career also highlights the gradual promotion of the position of master mason (medieval) to that of architect ‚Äì in the modern sense of the word ‚Äì, with the corresponding recognition and rise in social status. Author of a vast and notable body of built work, Jo√£o de Castilho is linked to the building of five historic monuments classified by UNESCO as World Heritage, two great highlights being the Jer√≥nimos Monastery and the Convent of Christ. Among many other works for which he was responsible, he also contributed to the Alcoba√ßa Monastery, the Batalha Monastery and the Mazag√£o Fortress (El Jadida), also classified as World Heritage. Career Castilho began working on the Cathedral in Bruges, before advancing to the Cathedral of Seville in his early career. From Seville he was summoned by the Archbishop of Braga, D. Diogo de Sousa, in 1509, to work on the chapel of the S√© Cathedral Following this period, he worked on the parochial Church of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista in Vila do Conde, where he lived for a while - the city was thriving economically at the time due to imports-exports activity through its port. From Vila do Conde, Jo√£o de Castilho began working in the Convent of Christ in Tomar. There he executed the celebrated gate and portico to the Church, responding to the beautiful Manueline window produced by Diogo de Arruda. His efforts were rewarded, when he was given the task of managing the public works at the Convent, which he maintained until his death. In 1517, he succeeded Diogo Boitaca as director of public works at the Monastery of the Jeronimos, where he designed the extraordinary southern portico (along with Gil Vicente, author of the Bel√©m Monstrance). He worked on five World Heritage Sites: * Convent of Christ (Tomar) * Jer√≥nimos Monastery * El Jadida * Batalha Monastery * Alcoba√ßa Monastery.

Members of the organization have continuously asserted that they are only a group of motorcycle enthusiasts who have joined to ride motorcycles together, to organize social events such as group road trips, fundraisers, parties, and motorcycle rallies, and that any crimes are the responsibility of the individuals who carried them out and not the club as a whole. Members of the club have been accused of crimes and/or convicted in many host nations. Australia The Hells Angels expanded to Australia in 1975, initially establishing chapters in Melbourne and Sydney, and now have approximately two- hundred-and-fifty members and fourteen chapters in the country. They are one of around thirty-five outlaw motorcycle clubs in Australia, which have an estimated 3,500 members in total. The club's activities in Australia have traditionally included drug trafficking, prostitution, armed robbery, arms trafficking, fencing stolen goods and murder-for-hire, but they have more recently moved into legitimate businesses such as gyms, tattoo parlours, haulage companies, and the security industry. Police allege the Hells Angels use mainstream industries to launder existing funds and to exploit new income streams, using the strategies they developed during a series of gang wars to intimidate business competitors. The Australian Hells Angels have aligned themselves with the Coffin Cheaters, Immortals, Red Devils, Satans Soldiers, Vikings and the Prisoners of War, a prison gang operating inside HMP Barwon, while they have been involved in conflicts with the Bandidos, Comancheros, Diablos, Finks, Nomads and Notorious. =New South Wales= Members of the rival motorcycle gang, the Comancheros, and members of the Hells Angels were believed to be involved in a clash at Sydney Airport on Sunday, March 22, 2009. The clash resulted in one man, Hells Angels associate Anthony Zervas, being beaten to death. Police estimated as many as 15 men were involved in the violence. Documents released by NSW Police detail the brawl as a result of a Comanchero gang member and a Hells Angel being on the same flight from Melbourne. Four suspects were arrested as a result of the altercation. As a result of heightening violence, New South Wales Premier Nathan Rees announced the state police anti-gang squad would be boosted to 125 members from 50. On the night of March 29, 2009, Hells Angels member Peter Zervas, the brother of the man killed during the Sydney Airport Brawl a week earlier, was shot and injured in retaliation as he left his car outside his home. On July 20, 2011, a NSW judge dismissed a bid by the state's police commissioner to have the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club declared a criminal organization, under laws introduced to NSW parliament in 2009 allowing the court to declare criminal organizations as declared organizations. =Queensland= Bruno and Nuno Da Silva, two Portuguese immigrant twin brothers and former Brisbane Hells Angels members, were arrested following a police surveillance operation and pleaded guilty to trafficking methylamphetamine from June 2012 to October 2013. The brothers operated from an East Brisbane locksmith business and passed a percentage of their drug earnings to the Hells Angels at weekly meetings, although they had left the club at the time of their arrest. In December 2015, Bruno was sentenced to nine years imprisonment, while Nuno was sentenced to seven years. In 2012, Peter Sidirourgos and Zeljko \\"Steve\\" Mitrovic, both senior Hells Angels members in Sydney, were granted Nomad status and spearheaded a push into the Gold Coast, founding a chapter in the suburb of Burleigh Heads. Police stated in 2015 that the Hells Angels were now the most active club on the Gold Coast after anti-bikie laws weakened the rival Bandidos and Finks (a club later patched over to the Mongols), who had previously been more prominent in the area. The Hells Angels were one of 26 motorcycle clubs designated as criminal organizations in the state of Queensland under the Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment (VLAD) Act, which was passed on October 16, 2013 and went into effect immediately. =South Australia= Similar to the case in Queensland, the Hells Angels were also declared a criminal organization in the state of South Australia along with nine other motorcycle clubs under legislation that came into force in August 2015. Under the laws, it is an offence for members of these organizations to gather in groups of three or more in public or wear gang colours and logos. Five alleged Hells Angels members and prospects became the first to be charged under the laws after they were arrested in a series of raids across Adelaide on December 31, 2015. =Victoria= In 1980, Melbourne chapter founding members Peter Hill and Raymond Hamment flew to California to visit Oakland chapter president Kenny Walton in prison. Walton taught them how to manufacture amphetamines, paving the way for the drug's introduction into Australia, and in return, the Australians supplied the Oakland chapter with 300 litres of the chemical phenylacetone, enough to produce $50 million worth of amphetamines. Hill posted the phenylacetone in three-litre pineapple juice tins to his closest US contact, James Patton \\"Sleepy Jim\\" Brandes. The Hells Angels rented a farmhouse in Melbourne's northeast, near Hurstbridge, where they produced amphetamines in 50 pound (22.7 kilogram) batches worth $600,000. The drug lab was raided by the Special Operations Group on March 10, 1982, and Hill and three other Hells Angels were arrested. Eventually, investigators arrested 19 people and seized three kilograms of amphetamines, as well as cash, explosives, handguns and a machine-gun. This sparked an internal feud over the gang's operations that led to around 40 violent incidents. Hill and another member, Roger Biddlestone, cut their ties with the Hells Angels and cooperated with police, prompting the club to put a contract on their lives. Nine Hells Angels were charged with conspiring to murder Hill and Biddlestone, but Biddlestone refused to testify and the charges against his former club mates were dropped; he was subsequently convicted of contempt of court. Hill was convicted on drugs charges in 1987 and jailed alongside a number of others. During the investigation, codenamed Omega Two, the police tracked club members' movements ferociously, prompting Jim Brandes, the Melbourne Hells Angels' American contact, to try to assassinate Bob Armstrong, a detective on the case. Brandes, who had previously been acquitted of the 1978 attempted murder two police officers in the US, flew to Melbourne but was immediately deported. Anton Kenny, a former president of the Hells Angels' Australian Nomads chapter who was kicked out of the club in 1983 for cooperating with police, was killed after being shot five times with a .32 caliber pistol following an afternoon of drinking at the home of Melbourne drug dealer Dennis Allen on November 7, 1985. His body was disposed of by having its legs cut off with a chainsaw and stuffed inside a 44-gallon drum with concrete and lime, and was discovered in the Yarra River nearly four months later. According to a witness, Kenny was murdered by Allen because he called him a \\"rat\\". Allen died of heart failure less than two years later, having never been charged with the murder. Terrence Raymond \\"Terry\\" Tognolini, the president and enforcer in the Hells Angels Nomads, was involved in an apparent road rage incident with motorist Mustafa Yildirim in Campbellfield, Melbourne on December 22, 1995. Tognolini followed Yildirim to his workplace and the men traded blows until they were separated before Tognolini retrieved a gun from his car and fired several shots at Yildirim, all of which missed. Police raided Tognolini's home and found five cannabis plants in the backyard. He was charged with unlawful assault, assault with a weapon, making threats to kill, possessing cannabis and cultivating a narcotic plant. The case against him collapsed, however, when Yildirim refused to testify after being repeatedly harassed. Terrence Tognolini was later implicated in the murder of Vicki Joy Jacobs, a 37-year- old woman who was shot six times as she slept next to her six-year-old son in her apartment in Long Gully, Bendigo on June 12, 1999. The previous year, Jacobs had given evidence that helped convict her ex-husband Gerald David Preston for the August 1996 murders of drug dealer and mechanic Les Knowles and his employee Tim Richards in Adelaide, and her testimony implicated the Hells Angels in hiring Preston for the killings. The prosecution heard that Tognolini had contracted Preston to murder Knowles who was trying to expand into the Hells Angels' drug territory, and also sold him the Luger pistol that was used in the murders. Victoria Police bulldozed their way into the fortified Thomastown headquarters of the Nomads chapter in July 1999 as part of the investigation, seizing a sawn-off shotgun, bulletproof vest, bags of documents and three motorcycles. Tognolini was overseas and Preston imprisoned at the time of Jacobs' murder and no one has been charged with the crime; however, a coronial inquest in 2004 declared that police believe she was killed on the orders of the Hells Angels as a payment for Preston remaining silent over the club's involvement in the Adelaide murders. Hells Angels members Raymond Joseph \\"Ray\\" Hamment, Jr. and Paul Peterson, and club associate Andrew Hinton, each pleaded guilty to charges of conduct endangering life, intentionally causing serious injury, false imprisonment and rioting after abducting Brendan Schievella from outside a bar and holding him captive for five hours in Ivanhoe, Melbourne on June 25, 2005. Schievella was found with a toe amputated but told police he could not recall how it happened and no motive has been established for the incident. In January 2007, Terrence Tognolini was expelled from the Hells Angels, had his tattoos removed, was savagely beaten and dumped on the street outside the Thomastown clubhouse after his fellow members learned that he was the subject of child sex allegations. Police arrested him on blackmail and arson charges and for a series of sex offences six months later. He was found guilty of 18 counts of supplying a drug of dependence to a child, one count of an indecent act with a child under 16, and one count of attempting to pervert the course of justice and imprisoned for six-and-a-half years in 2009, and was further convicted of nine counts of blackmail, three of arson, two of intentionally causing injury and stalking and had 18 months added to his sentence in 2010. Many of Toglioni's crimes were part of an extortion racket he ran, using his former Hells Angels connections as well as threats and assaults to intimidate his victims. On June 18, 2007, Hells Angels member Christopher Wayne Hudson opened fire on two men and a woman during an argument in the Central Business District of Melbourne; after assaulting his girlfriend Kara Douglas, two male bystanders, Brendan Keilar and Paul de Waard attempted to assist Douglas. Hudson pulled a gun and shot all three, killing Keilar, on the corner of William Street and Flinders Lane. Hudson fled from the scene and went into hiding for two days, before turning himself in to police on June 20, 2007 in Wallan, north of Melbourne. In May 2008, Hudson pleaded guilty to the murder of Brendan Keilar and was sentenced that September to life imprisonment with a minimum of 35 years before becoming eligible for parole. Hells Angels member Glyn David Dickman was found guilty of intentionally causing serious injury and threatening to kill, and acquitted of theft, while club hang-around Ali Chaouk was found guilty of recklessly causing serious injury, threat to kill and false imprisonment in October 2014 after the pair beat 18-year-old German tourist Faisal Aakbari with a baseball bat at the Hells Angels clubhouse in Thomastown in September 2009 when he falsely claimed to be a club member. Aakbari's injuries included bleeding between the skull and lining of the brain, a broken leg and lacerations to his scalp and face. Peter John \\"Skitzo\\" Hewat, sergeant-at-arms of the Hells Angels' East County chapter in Campbellfield, Melbourne, was arrested in March 2013 after striking a 64-year- old woman during a dispute over his dog, and was again arrested that October as part of a statewide raid targeting the Hells Angels in which thirteen people were arrested and weapons and drugs were seized. Hewat was sentenced to 10 months in jail in January 2014 after he pleaded guilty to assault, weapons offences, handling stolen goods and operating a tow truck without the proper licence. The Bandidos reportedly declared war on the Hells Angels after an ambush on several Bandidos members outside the affiliated Diablos' clubhouse in Melton, Melbourne on March 1, 2013 in which over 30 shots were fired and two men, including Bandidos national sergeant-at-arms Toby Mitchell, were wounded. The Hells Angels Nomads chapter were blamed for the attack and brothers Daniel and Ben Pegoraro, both members of Hells Angels puppet club the Red Devils, were questioned by police. Within a week of the shooting, a clubhouse in Bendigo linked to the Hells Angels was burned down and the Pegoraro brothers' home in Epping, Melbourne was attacked in a drive-by shooting. Although prolonged violence was expected, the feud seemingly ended after senior members of the two clubs held peace talks. Ray Hamment, Jr., the president of the Hells Angels Nomads, pleaded guilty to a charge of recklessly causing serious injury and was jailed three months after attacking a man who approached him in a McDonald's restaurant in Thomastown on June 7, 2013. The Hells Angels carried out drive-by shootings (using either AK-47s or M1 carbines) and attempted bombings on two properties, a tattoo parlour in Dandenong and a gym in Hallam, owned by Comancheros state president Michael \\"Mick\\" Murray in the early hours of September 30, 2013 after several Hells Angels were assaulted while trying to recover stolen motorcycles from the rival club. Within hours of the attacks, the clubhouse of the Hells Angels' Darkside chapter in Seaford, Melbourne was shot at in an apparent retaliation. On October 13, 2013, Victoria police raided every Hells Angels property in the state in an attempt to curb bikie-related violence, seizing guns, ammunition, drugs and cash, and arresting 13 people, but failed to retrieve the assault rifles used in the shootings. Dennis Basic, a prospective member of the Darkside chapter, was arrested for the attempted bombings of the properties and pleaded guilty to thirteen charges which also included firearm and drug possession; having been held in custody since his arrest until the time of his sentencing in December 2015, the judge ruled that the time he had served in jail was sufficient penalty but ordered he serve a 12-month community corrections order. The president of the Hells Angels' Darkside chapter, Mohammed \\"Sam\\" Khodr, was jailed for seven-and-a-half years for selling more than $220,000 worth of amphetamines to undercover police officers in January 2015. He had been targeted during an investigation code-named Operation Statin, part of a major crackdown on motorcycle gangs by Victoria Police, and sold 910 grams of the drug to officers in 11 separate transactions between October 2013 and February 2014. He also sold a Browning semi-automatic pistol with ammunition to the officers for $10,500. Belgium Belgium became home to its first Hells Angels chapter in the summer of 1997, at which time a major Belgian police inquiry into the club immediately began. In May 1999, Belgium became the first country in the world to declare the Hells Angels an illegal organization with Vincent hallez. A court in Ghent ruled that the motorcycle club amounts to a private militia ‚Äì membership of which is banned under Belgian law. On October 4, 2009 several Hells Angels and allied Red Devils performed a raid on an Outlaws clubhouse in Kortrijk. Shots were fired and three Outlaws were wounded before the Hells Angels and their Red Devils comrades fled the scene. The incident occurred after members of the Outlaws supposedly pushed over a motorcycle belonging to Red Devils president Johan F. in Moeskroen. The raid is also thought to be a part of a territorial dispute between the Hells Angels and the Red Devils on one side and the Outlaws on the other. Several months before the raid, on July 24, 2009, members of the Red Devils and Hells Angels already retaliated by setting fire to motorcycles outside an Outlaws clubhouse. Eventually six Hells Angels and two Red Devils were convicted for attempted murder and given sentences from five to twenty years in prison. Hells Angels member Ali Ipekci shot dead Outlaws member Freddy Put, hangaround Jef Banken and supporter Michael Gerekens in an industrial zone in Maasmechelen where the Outlaws were holding an opening reception for a new tire centre on May 20, 2011. He was convicted of triple murder and sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment on February 6, 2015. In October 2014, 47-year-old British man Conrad Toland was arrested by Spanish police in Madrid and brought before the National Court in Madrid to face extradition proceedings to Belgium where he was wanted to complete a 10-year sentence for smuggling 155 kilograms of cocaine into the country from Ecuador in July 2011 inside a tuna shipment. He then supplied the drugs to the Hells Angels chapter in Bruges. He also faced charges in Belgium of membership in an armed gang and money laundering. Canada The Criminal Intelligence Service Canada (CISC) has designated the Hells Angels an outlaw motorcycle gang.2004 Annual Report - Criminal Intelligence Service Canada, cisc.gc.ca In 2002, Crown Prosecutor Graeme Williams sought to have the club formally declared a \\"criminal organization\\" by applying the anti-gang legislation (Bill C-24) to a criminal prosecution involving the Hells Angels and two of its members, Stephen \\"Tiger\\" Lindsay and Raymond \\"Razor\\" Bonner. The prosecution team launched a three-year investigation with the aim of collecting evidence for the trial. The Canadian Hells Angels have partnered the Rizzuto crime family, the Sinaloa CartelEl Chapo‚Äôs Sinaloa cartel made nearly $3M a day in Canada, former DEA agent claims Andrew Russell, Global News (9 January 2019) and the West End Gang in criminal operations. Additionally, the club has also formed alliances with various street gangs, including the Indian Posse,Indian Posse gang profile infotracer.com Independent Soldiers, Red Scorpions, United Nations and White Boy Posse, and smaller motorcycle gangs, such as Bacchus and the Red Devils. According to CBC News, the Hells Angels have thirty-four chapters operating in Canada with 1,260 full-fledged (patched) members. According to this article, the Hells Angels had at that time fifteen chapters in Ontario, eight in British Columbia, five in Quebec, three in Alberta, two in Saskatchewan and one in Manitoba. In a speech to the House of Commons, Bloc Qu√©b√©cois MP R√©al M√©nard (Hochelaga) stated that there were thirty-eight HAMC chapters across Canada in the mid-1990s. The Vancouver Sun newspaper reports that Canada has more Hells Angels members per capita than any other country, including the U.S., where there are chapters in about twenty states.The Vancouver Sun (June 10, 2005), B.C.'s Hells Angels: Rich and Powerful The Hells Angels established their first Canadian chapters in the province of Quebec during the seventies. On 5 December 1977, the first Canadian chapter was founded in Montreal when a club called the Popeyes led by Yves Buteau were \\"patched over\\". In September 1979, new Angels chapters were established in Laval and Sherbrooke. In Western Canada, in 1983 a Vancouver club known as Satan's Angels were patched over to form the first BC chapter. In December 1984, the 13th Tribe biker club in Halifax, Nova Scotia led by David \\"Wolf\\" Carroll \\"patched over\\" to become the first Hells Angels chapter in Atlantic Canada. The Outlaws and several affiliated independent clubs such as Satan's Choice and Para-Dice Riders were able to keep the Angels from assuming a dominant position in Ontario, Canada's most populous province until 2000. On the Prairies, the Grim Reapers of Alberta, Los Bravos in Manitoba, and several other independent clubs across the Prairies formed a loose alliance that kept the Hells Angels from assuming dominance in the Prairie provinces until the late nineties. In 1997 the Grim Reapers club of Calgary, Alberta were patched over and in 1998, the Rebels of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan joined. By the end of 2000, under the leadership of Walter \\"Nurget\\" Stadnick, and after the largest patchover in Canadian history occurred in Montreal with the bulk of the Ontario biker clubs \\"patching over\\" on 29 December 2000, the Hells Angels had become the dominant club not just in BC and Quebec, but all across Canada, with chapters in at least seven of ten provinces and affiliates in at least two of the three territories. On 12 January 2002, a Hells Angels convention in Toronto was gate-clashed by the mayor of Toronto, Mel Lastman, who was photographed shaking hands with an Angel, Tony Biancaflora, and told the media the Angels were \\"fantastic\\" for bringing so much \\"business\\" to Toronto, saying: \\"You know, they just a nice bunch of guys\\". Jos√©e-Anne Desrochers, the mother of the 11-year-old Daniel Desrochers killed by an Angel bombing in 1995, stated: \\"I find it degrading. Is the government with us or is it the bikers who are with the government?\\". In 2006, the Bandidos, the only possible rivals to the Hells Angels in Canada, self-destructed with the Shedden massacre, leaving the Angels as the only national outlaw biker club in Canada. An officer with the Ontario Provincial Police stated that after the Shedden massacre that: \\"The Hells Angels were on easy street. They had a monopoly across Canada.\\" =British Columbia= Investigations In late 2004 to 2005, the culmination of investigations into the actions of the motorcycle club led to charges against 18 people, including members of the Hells Angels and other associates of the gang. ;Background In July 2003, a man offered to give police information and became the police agent around whom much of the E-Pandora investigation ensued. Charges arose from project E-Pandora, an extensive police investigation, into the alleged criminal activities of the East End Charter of the Hells Angels (the \\"EEHA\\"). The evidence in this case included intercepted private communications including telephone and audio recordings, physical surveillance, and expert evidence. The case would eventually be dubbed the trial of R. v. Giles, and would see three charged individuals appear before the Supreme Court of British Columbia (SCBC). 72 appearances would span from May 14, 2007 until February 20, 2008 and, by order of Madam Justice Anne MacKenzie, include a publication ban on related trials.The Canadian Legal Information Institute (CanLII). \\"R. v. Giles, 2008 BCSC 367 (CanLII)\\". March 27, 2008. CanLII ‚Äì Canadian Legal Institute & Lexum ;Ruling On March 27, 2008, the SCBC Justice MacKenzie ruled against prosecutors who had attempted to convict a Hells Angels member of possession for the benefit of a criminal organization. Although two associates of the Hells Angels, David Roger Revell, 43, and Richard Andrew Rempel, 24, were convicted of possession for the purpose of trafficking, Justice MacKenzie concluded that with the acquittal of the only Hells Angel member being tried, David Francis Giles, on a charge of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, a second charge against him (count two) of possessing it for the benefit of a criminal organization had to fail as well.The Canadian Legal Information Institute (CanLII). \\"R. v. Giles, 2008 BCSC 367 (CanLII)\\". March 27, 2008. CanLII ‚Äì Canadian Legal Institute & Lexum, at paragraphs 237-38. In summary, Revell and Rempel were found guilty but Giles was found not guilty on either count. Also, Revell and Rempel were found not guilty on the charge of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. In her acquittal of Giles, Justice MacKenzie said she found the evidence against him was \\"weak\\" and intercepted communications were \\"unreliable\\" because they were difficult to hear. She further stated that the Crown prosecutors had failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt the group was working to the \\"benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal organization, to wit: the East End charter of the Hells Angels\\". Project Halo, a three-year investigation by the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Team of the RCMP, into alleged criminal activity with the Nanaimo chapter. The investigation culminated in the search warrant being executed on December 12, 2003. On November 9, 2007 a seizure order was executed, under section 467.12(1) of the Criminal Code, on the clubhouse by dozens of heavily armed RCMP officers.[80] =Manitoba= The Hells Angels' expansion into Manitoba began with a relationship with Los Bravos, a local motorcycle club. In 2000 Los Bravos were \\"patched over,\\" becoming a full- fledged Hells Angels chapter. The following investigations over the last two years have been executed with the following charges. On February 15, 2006 the Manitoba Integrated Organized Crime Task Force, along with over 150 police officers from the RCMP, Winnipeg Police Service and Brandon Police Service, made numerous arrests and conducted searches as part of the investigation of Project Defense. Thirteen people were indicted on a variety of charges, including drug trafficking, extortion, proceeds of crime, and organized crime related offenses. Project Defense was initiated in November 2004 and focused on high level members of drug trafficking cells in the province of Manitoba, including members of the Manitoba Hells Angels. During the investigation police made numerous seizures that totaled in excess of seven kilograms of cocaine and three kilograms of methamphetamine from drug traffickers within the Manitoba Hells Angels organization and other drug trafficking cells. Arrest warrants were issued for thirteen individuals and 12 search warrants were authorized for locations in Winnipeg and area. This long-term covert investigation was initiated by the Manitoba Integrated Organized Crime Task Force, which was established in the spring of 2004 when an Agreement was signed between the Winnipeg Police Service, the RCMP, the Brandon Police Service and the Province of Manitoba. The mandate of the task force was to disrupt and dismantle organized crime in the province of Manitoba. On December 12, 2007 Project Drill came to an end, with Winnipeg Police raiding the Hells Angels clubhouse on Scotia Street. Project Drill started the previous evening with arrests in Thompson and continued throughout the night and early morning in Winnipeg and St. Pierre-Jolys. During the course of Project Drill, police seized vehicles, approximately $70,000 cash, firearms, marijuana, Hells Angel related documents/property and other offense related property. As of December 12, 14 people were in custody and four were still being sought. Police said it was the second time the chapter president was the target in a police sting since the gang set up shop in the city in 2001. Hells Angels prospect member Al LeBras was also arrested at his Barber Street home in Wednesday's raids. The recently amended Criminal Property Forfeiture Act gives the province the power to seize the proceeds of crime. Police have exercised similar authority against Hells Angels members in other Canadian cities. On December 2, 2009 Project Divide culminated with 26 arrests, and 8 arrest warrants still outstanding after the year-long investigation. The investigation and arrests targeted alleged drug-trafficking and related activities of the Zig Zag Crew ‚Äì a puppet club of the Hells Angels Winnipeg chapter. Other joint investigations include: * Project Develop,'Project Develop', 'Project Develop' 40 HA locations raided a joint 18-month investigation with Ontario, New Brunswick, and British Columbia * In January 2006, Project Husky, a two-year investigation involving police forces in Ontario, Quebec and Alberta, resulted in the arrest of twenty-seven suspects including five full-patch Angels from across Eastern and Central Canada * Project Koker, 23-month investigation in Edmonton and Calgary * Project Halo, a three-year investigation by the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Team of the RCMP, into alleged criminal activity with the Nanaimo chapter. The investigation culminated in the search warrant being executed on December 12, 2003. On November 9, 2007 a seizure order was executed, under section 467.12(1) of the Criminal Code, on the clubhouse by dozens of heavily armed RCMP officers. =Ontario= In September 2006, after an 18-month investigation conducted by numerous law enforcement agencies and dubbed \\"Project Tandem,\\" 500 officers and 21 tactical teams raided property connected to the Hells Angels chapters in Ontario. At least 27 members were arrested of which 15 were members of the Hells Angels. Property seized was worth more than 1 million dollars and included $470,000 in cash, $300,000 in vehicles and $140,000 in motorcycles. During the raids, drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy were seized; the total street value of drugs seized was more than 3 million dollars. In April 2007, after another 18-month investigation, this one dubbed \\"Project Develop,\\" 32 Club Houses were raided in Ontario, New Brunswick and British Columbia. The Hells Angels Clubhouse on 498 Eastern Avenue in Toronto was raided by the Biker Enforcement Unit of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and members of the Toronto Police Service on April 4, 2007, at least 15 members of the Hells Angels were detained and charged with drug and weapons offenses at the Eastern Avenue Clubhouse raid. According to police, Project Develop seized some 500 litres of GHB worth an estimated $996,000, nine kilograms of cocaine, two kilograms of hashish and oxycodone and Viagra pills. Police also seized $21,000 in cash. Project Develop also seized 67 rifles, five handguns, three pairs of brass knuckles and a police baton. On May 21, 2011, five of the accused arrested as part of Project Develop were convicted by a jury of various drug offenses including trafficking in cocaine and oxycodone, participating in a conspiracy to traffic GHB and possession of GHB for the purpose of trafficking. One of the accused was convicted of possessing a restricted firearm without a license. However, one accused, represented by defence lawyer Lenny Hochberg, was acquitted of two counts of trafficking handguns and possession of brass knuckles and another accused, Larry Pooler the Toronto chapter vice-president who represented himself, was acquitted of two counts of possessing unrestricted firearms without a license, two counts of trafficking oxycodone and one count of participating in a conspiracy to traffic GHB. Furthermore, all accused were acquitted of all charges of acting in association with, or for the benefit of, a criminal organization. =Quebec= The emergence of biker gangs in Quebec happened contemporaneously with the United States. Quebec's economic crisis of the 1920s saw many of Quebec's urban population heading for the rural communities in order to cultivate lands to provide for themselves and their families. The settlers' children, like many youth of this era, were rebellious and rejected their parents' values. While the American gangs were created by World War II veterans, in Quebec the formation of motorcycle clubs which was seen as an expression of this rebellion. The period from 1936 to 1960 is remembered by Qu√©b√©cois as the Grande Noirceur (\\"Great Darkness\\") when Quebec was for the most part ruled by the ultra-conservative Union Nationale party who imposed traditional Catholic values in a way now considered to be oppressive. With the 1960 provincial election that resulted in the Union Nationale being defeated by the Quebec Liberals, which is considered to be the beginning of the Quiet Revolution that saw Quebec go during the course of a decade from being a very conservative to being a very liberal society. As part of the reaction against the \\"medieval\\" Catholic values of the Grande Noirceur saw the emergence of a hedonist culture in Quebec with la belle province having, for example, a significantly higher rate of drug use and illegitimate births than English Canada. As part of the same backlash against the \\"suffocating\\" conformism of the Grande Noirceur, outlaw biker clubs became extremely popular in Quebec in the 1960s as many young French-Canadian men saw the outlaw biker culture as a way of expressing rebelliousness and machismo, and by 1968 Quebec had 350 outlaw biker clubs. By the 1960s, Quebec outlaw motorcycle clubs incorporated many of the same characteristics as American biker clubs, although they mainly operated in rural communities instead of in major cities. One result of having so many outlaw biker clubs in the same province was an especially brutal competition for the control of organized crime rackets in Quebec. The crime journalist James Dubro stated about the distinctive outlaw biker sub-culture of Quebec: \\"There's always has been more violence in Quebec. In the biker world it's known as the Red Zone. I remember an Outlaws hit man telling me he was scared going to Montreal.\\" The expansion of these groups flourished during the 1970s, as a few popular gangs, notably the Hells Angels and the Outlaws, grew almost 45% due to Quebec's biker groups affiliating themselves with their American counterparts. On 17 February 1978, Yves \\"Apache\\" Trudeau, the Hells Angels leading assassin, killed an Outlaw outside of a Montreal bar. In the ensuring biker war between the two gangs, Trudeau confirmed his reputation as a \\"psychopathic killer\\" as he killed 18 out of the 23 Outlaws slain during the conflict. The conflict ended in 1984 with the Hells Angels as the leading biker gang in Quebec and the Outlaws as the leading gang in Ontario. In 1985, in the Lennoxville massacre, the Angels liquidated their chapter in Laval, which caused much them disorganization with many of their leaders being imprisoned and the national president of Hells Angels Canada, Michel \\"Sky\\" Langois, fleeing to Morocco to escape an arrest warrant for first degree murder. The Quebec branch of the Hells Angels at its prime included various clubhouses across Quebec which housed many of the gang's puppet groups, who would often carry out the gang's criminal activity. Every Quebec region had its own puppet club: the Rockers in Montreal, the Rowdy Ones in Sorel, the Evil Ones in Drummondville, the Satan's Guard in the Saguenay region, and the Jokers in St-Jean, which includes Maurice Boucher's son, Francis, as a full-fledged member. The Quebec Biker war between the Hells Angels and the Rock Machine began in 1994 and continued until late 2002 and claimed more than 162 lives, including innocent bystanders. Maurice (aka Mom) Boucher was the leader of the Quebec chapters and second-in-command of the Canadian Nomad chapter, a chapter with no fixed geographic base. On 13 September 2000, Michel Auger, the crime correspondent of Le Journal de Montr√©al was shot five times in the back while opening the trunk of his car in the parking lot of Le Journal de Montr√©al, and was almost killed. In the aftermath of the attempting assassination of Auger, journalists demonstrated in Montreal demanding that the Canadian government pass an RICO type act that would see the Hells Angels declared a criminal organization. In October 2000, a bar owner in the town of Terrebonne named Francis Laforest refused to permit the Rowdy Ones, a puppet club of the Hells Angels, to sell drugs in his bar. As Laforest was walking his dog, he was attacked on the streets in the daylight by three masked men who beat him to death with baseball bats. Led by Auger, a protest took place in Montreal to honor Laforest with Auger saying of Quebec's murderous outlaw bikers: \\"They believed that they are on the top of the world. The criminals had built up a system so sophisticated that they are above the law...We are the only country in the world where the gangs have a free ride\\". In May 2002, Boucher received a life sentence, with no possibility of parole for at least 25 years, after being convicted of two counts of first- degree murder for the killings of two Canadian prison guards, ambushed on their way home. On April 15, 2009, operation SharQc was conducted by the S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec. The first specialized organized crime law enforcement task force in the province was composed of the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), the S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec and the Montr√©al Police. Their goal was to investigate the Nomad chapter of the Hells Angels in the Montreal and Quebec City regions until it was dismantled two years later to make way for a bigger, province-wide Task force. The Hells Angels threat in Quebec and Canada resulted in the first anti-gang law in Canadian legislation, as the Canadian government wished to build on the success of the American anti-racketeering legislation known as RICO. Furthermore, during the period the Canadian anti- gang legislation was created, many Montrealers were experiencing a high volume of violent acts which threatened civilians. The tough shell of secrecy that protected the Hells Angels for years finally cracked during an investigation that has resulted in the arrests of almost every member of the gang in Quebec. On April 15, 2009, operation SharQc was conducted by the S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec. According to police, at the time it was the biggest strike at the HAMC in Canada's history and probably in all of HAMC's history. In all, 177 strikes were conducted by the police, 123 members were arrested, charged with for first-degree murder, attempted murder, gangsterism, or drug trafficking. The police seized $5 million in cash, dozens of kilograms of cocaine, marijuana and hashish, and thousands of pills. The operation was expected to lead to the closing of 22 unsolved murders. Operation SharQc involved a full-patch member of the gang turning informant, a very rare occurrence in Quebec. In October 2015, Quebec Superior Court Judge James Brunton ruled that delay between the arrests in 2009 as part of Operation SharQc and 2015 violated the right to a speedy trial guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and dismissed all of the charges against the Hell's Angels arrested as part of Operation SharQc. Denmark Hells Angels in Sundby√∏ster, Copenhagen (2011). Conflicts between youth gangs from the Copenhagen districts of Amager Vest, Amager √òst and N√∏rrebro started to occur in the early 1970s and by the late 1970s, the Galloping Goose, Nomads, Iron Sculls and Dirty Angels motorcycle clubs united as Unionen MC before applying for membership of the Hells Angels. The former Unionen officially became the first Scandinavian Hells Angels chapter on December 30, 1980, setting up chapters in Copenhagen's Titangade and N√∏rrebro districts. Shortly thereafter, the Filthy Few, an Amager-based club, merged with the N√∏ragersmindebanden to form Bullshit MC, settling in Freetown Christiania where they benefited from the trade in cannabis products and challenged the Hells Angels for control of Copenhagen's biker scene. The two clubs would wage war against each other between September 1983 and December 1985. The Copenhagen biker war began on September 24, 1983 when three Bullshit members and a woman entered the S√∏promenaden restaurant, a known Hells Angels hangout, at Dag Hammerskjolds Alle 37. Two of the three Bullshit members, S√∏ren Grabow Grander (November 25, 1962 ‚Äì September 24, 1983) and Flemming Hald Jensen (April 4, 1962 ‚Äì September 24, 1983) were killed in a bottle and knife attack. Hells Angels member Bent \\"Blondie\\" Svane Nielsen was convicted for the murders. In November 1983, Bullshit president Henning Norbert \\"Makrellen\\" Knudsen (January 15, 1960 ‚Äì May 25, 1984) was interviewed on the live television show Mellem Mennesker (\\"Between Humans\\"), which aired on DR TV, and stated that he would not allow an American motorcycle club such as the Hells Angels to gain control in Denmark.apart from the TV-show \\"Mellem Mennesker\\" in November 1983, parts of this TV-show were broadcast in an episode of the newer TV-series \\"24 timer vi aldrig glemmer\\" (\\"24 hours we never forget\\"). The episode's name is \\"Mordet p√• Makrellen\\" (The assassination of \\"Makrellen\\") Original date of broadcast December 20, 2009. Rebroadcast in DR2 several times in August 2012. Knudsen was shot and killed with a submachine gun in front of his wife Pia outside their home on May 25, 1984. At the time of his death, Knudsen and other Bullshit members were the prime suspects for the double murder of two young men (aged 16 and 20) in Amager six days before. A Yugoslavian immigrant would later be convicted of those murders, however. Three Hells Angels were convicted for their part in Knudsen's killing; Jens-Peter Kristensen was sentenced to twelve years in prison, and Christian Middelboe was sentenced to seven years, both for aiding J√∏rn \\"J√∏nke\\" Nielsen who carried out the shooting. Nielsen fled to Canada but was apprehended and extradited back to Denmark in 1989 where he served sixteen years in prison for the murder. The following two Bullshit presidents after Knudsen were also assassinated. Palle \\"Lillebror\\" Bl√•bjerg (July 26, 1959 ‚Äì April 26, 1985) was shot dead at work; while delivering beers to an off- licence store in Valby Langgade on April 26, 1985, Carsten Bresl√∏v (born June 9, 1958), a member of the Morticians who were a club affiliated with the Hells Angels at the time, entered the store wearing a mask and shot Bl√•bjerg. In court, Bresl√∏v claimed to have no regrets whatsoever, apart from not having killed Bl√•bjerg's working colleague as well. Anker Walther \\"H√∏vding\\" Marcus (January 17, 1947 ‚Äì December 21, 1985) was then murdered by Ole Bonnesen Nielsen and Rene N√∏ddeskov Ludvigsen, two members of the Black Sheep (another Hells Angels prospect club), following a Christmas party at Nemoland Caf√© in Christiania on December 21, 1985. Lars Michael Larsen (October 16, 1965 ‚Äì December 21, 1985), an innocent bystander, was also killed in this attack after being shot in the mouth. Nielsen and Ludvigsen claimed that they had shot in self-defence after Marcus had drawn a handgun first. Bullshit MC left Christiania following Marcus' death and formally disbanded in 1988. By the end of the Copenhagen biker war, eight Bullshit members had been killed compared to one Hells Angel, in addition to one \\"civilian\\" which brought the total death toll to ten during the 2-year-four-month-long conflict. The Black Sheep later \\"patched-over\\" to (were absorbed by) the Hells Angels, while the Morticians were declined membership. The Morticians, who were founded in 1984, became a rival club of the Hells Angels by 1992 before changing their name to Undertakers MC and later aligning themselves with the Bandidos, whose only European chapter was based in Marseille, France at that point. In 1993, the Undertakers merged with the Bandidos to become Bandidos MC Denmark. In 1994, the Hells Angels tried to prevent another club, Morbids MC, from growing into an established biker gang and potential rival in Sweden. The Morbids then also joined an alliance with the Bandidos, who backed-up their prospect club. Outlaws MC also joined with the Bandidos in Norway. This eventually led to the Great Nordic Biker War, a conflict over control of the drug trade between the two most powerful outlaw biker gangs in Scandinavia, the Hells Angels and the Bandidos. After gang violence had already erupted in Finland, Norway and Sweden, the war reached Denmark on December 25, 1995 when two Hells Angels members were beaten up by Bandidos at a nightclub in Copenhagen, signaling the beginning of a number of violent incidents between the clubs in the country. Bandidos members who were returning from a weekend in Helsinki were shot, three wounded and one, Uffe Larsen, was killed at Copenhagen Airport on March 10, 1996. Six Hells Angels members and associates were convicted and sentenced to a total of 53 years in prison, and one was given a life sentence, for the attack. In April and May 1996, the clubhouse of a Hells Angels prospect club, Avengers MC, was attacked in Aalborg. On October 6, 1996, an anti-tank rocket was fired at a Hells Angels clubhouse in Copenhagen during a party. Hells Angels member Louis Linde Nielsen and guest Janne Krohn were both killed. Bandidos prospect Niels Poulsen was convicted of carrying out the attacks and sentenced to life in prison. Towards the end of 1996, there were shootings of Bandidos members in Horsens and Aalborg. At the beginning of 1997, Hells Angels member Kim Thrys√∂e Svendsen was murdered in Aalborg. Outlaws president Thore \\"Henki\\" Holm and a French Outlaws member were subsequently shot and wounded by a member of the Untouchables MC, a Hells Angels ally. Bandidos foot-soldiers were also shot in Amager and K√∏ge. The Bandidos responded by ordering shootings on Hells Angels members and allies in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen. Bj√∂rn Gudmandsen was then killed and three other Bandidos were wounded after a shooting in Liseleje on June 7, 1997. Hells Angels member Vagn Smith was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The last incident happened on August 11, 1997 when the Bandidos clubhouse in Dalby was bombed. The war ended on September 25, 1997 as \\"Big\\" Jim Tinndahn, the president of the Bandidos' European chapters, and Hells Angels Europe president Bent \\"Blondie\\" Svane Nielsen announced that they had signed a peace agreement and shook hands in front of Danish TV news cameras. By the end of the war, 11 murders and 74 attempted murders had been committed and 96 people were wounded across Scandinavia. A law was passed in Denmark that banned motorcycle clubs from owning or renting property for their club activities. The law has subsequently been repealed on constitutional grounds. Bandidos associate Flemming Jensen was beaten and stabbed to death by Hells Angels members in a tavern in Aalborg on August 12, 2001. Hells Angels prospect Jesper √òstenk√¶r Kristoffersen confessed to stabbing Jensen eight times and was sentenced to six years in prison for manslaughter on February 7, 2002, while J√∏rn \\"J√∏nke\\" Nielsen was sentenced to four years on September 18, 2002 for aggravated assault resulting in death as witnesses claimed that he had kicked and stomped on Jensen. In 2007, a Hells Angels-associated gang named Altid Klar-81 (\\"Altid Klar\\" is Danish for \\"Always Ready\\" and 81 is synonymous with the letters HA) was formed in Denmark to combat immigrant street gangs in a feud over the lucrative illegal hash market. AK81 has been recruiting much quicker than the mainstream Hells Angels as members are not required to own a motorcycle or wear a patch, and racial tensions are running high in parts of Denmark. On August 14, 2008, Osman Nuri Dogan, a 19-year-old Turk, was shot and killed by an AK81 member in Tingbjerg. Later that year, on October 8, there was a shoot-out between AK81 members and a group of immigrants in N√∏rrebro, Copenhagen, during which one man was injured. Germany The first German charter of the Hells Angels was founded in the 1970 in Hamburg and was active in the red-light districts of St. Pauli and Sternschanze. In 1980, Hells Angels members murdered a nightclub manager on the island of Sylt. On August 11, 1983, 500 police officers stormed the clubhouse \\"Angels Place\\" in the red-light district Sternschanze and arrested the leaders of the Hells Angels of Hamburg. In 1986, thirteen members were sentenced between 6 months to 7 years in prison and the Hamburg charter and its symbols were banned. Despite the ban, today there is again a Hells Angels charter in Hamburg under the name of \\"Harbor City\\", because the association is not prohibited as such, but only wearing its symbols. The other Hells Angels members and 250 of 497 members of the motorcycle club \\"Bones\\" in Hannover under its President Frank Hanebuth, who is a colorful character in the red-light scene of Hannover, took over the power in the Hamburg Kiez and controlled numerous brothels, including the \\"Laufhaus\\" and the \\"Pascha\\", on the Reeperbahn. Some women were forced into prostitution with brutal violence. At the height of its power in the middle of 2000, the monthly brothel sales amounted to ‚Ç¨150,000 (DM300,000). After a leading member of the Hells Angels, Norbert \\"Butcher\\" S., 34, had beaten up a 42-year-old woman, waitress, prostitute, cocaine addict and drug courier, who tried to burn herself to death, she pointed him out to the police and disappeared. Meanwhile, Butcher fled to Brazil because the Hells Angels had set a bounty on him. German investigators tracked him to South America and persuaded him to give evidence. On November 1, 2000, 400 police officers moved to a major raid and arrested the new leadership of the association. In Germany, Sweden and Poland 17 suspects were arrested and more than 50 kilograms of narcotics were seized. The witnesses are now living under police protection because they fear for their lives. Karlsruhe club house in Wagh√§usel Helmut \\"Miko\\" M., a leading figure of the Karlsruhe Hells Angels, a 42-year-old brothel owner and notorious red-light figure in Karlsruhe, was shot dead in January 2004 in a coffee shop downtown in broad daylight. Previously, in December 2003, a bomb attack perpetrated on him failed due to an intermittent contact in the explosive device. The background to the crime was disputes over open money claims in the red-light district. In March 2006, a group of Hells Angels raided a Bandidos clubhouse in Stuhr where they assaulted and robbed five Bandidos members. Three were given jail sentences and another eleven were handed down suspended sentences at the trial which took place in Hannover on December 16, 2008. On May 27, 2007, five Hells Angels members attacked, robbed and injured one Bandidos member in Hohensch√∂nhausen, Berlin. Nineteen police vehicles were in use and shots were fired. A witness filmed the scene. All people involved including the Hells Angels, Bandidos and the witness were silent in court. Sources say there are two high ranking Hells Angels members involved in the conflict. One is the former President of the \\"Hells Angels of Berlin\\" and the other was a high ranking \\"Road Captain\\" who is now the \\"Treasurer\\" of the \\"Hells Angels of Berlin.\\" On June 11, 2008, Heino B., 48 and Thomas K., 36, two Bandidos members were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of the Hells Angels member Robert K. in Ibbenb√ºren. Reports say they drove to his Harley-Davidson shop and shot him there on May 23, 2007. After the first day of a related lawsuit on December 17, 2007, riots between the two gangs and the police were reported. Robert K. was 47-years old and \\"Road Captain\\" of the Bremen Hells Angels but lived in the area of Osnabr√ºck, where their rivals Bandidos claim supremacy. Also in June 2008, eight Hells Angels members of the \\"Hells Angels West Side\\" and one unidentified biker, who is not a Hells Angels member, were arrested on the A27 near Walsrode. Five private apartments and the clubhouse \\"Angels Place\\" in Bremen were searched. Police reports say the LKA-Bremen seized firearms, baseball bats, knives and illegal drugs. Later on the day the BKA (Bundeskriminalamt) arrested another Hells Angels member. Police reports also say five Hells Angels members are on the run. On July 17, 2008, 34 persons of a group of 50 were arrested in Oranienburg street in Berlin Mitte. Sources say the persons are supporters of the Hells Angels and bouncers and hooligans in the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern scene. Other sources say the persons are members of the \\"Brigade 81\\", a murderous group of the Hells Angels. One of the hooligans (now ex-hooligan and vice-president of the Potsdam Hells Angels) was a famous and dangerous fighter, who had beaten the French police officer Daniel Nivel into a coma in 1998. The police seized white masks, knuckle dusters, telescopic batons, quartz-sand-gloves and illegal drugs. The background of the incident was that a group of Bandidos appeared in the \\"Gold Club\\" and wanted to play power games. \\"It's about the staking of areas and the protection of illegal sources of income\\", a police statement said. Later in 2008, Bandidos members attacked a Hells Angels member in Berlin and shots were fired at a Hells Angels member in Cottbus. In Kiel, a mass brawl occurred between members of the Hells Angels and alleged right-wing extremists. During the brutal conflict a Hells Angels member and tattooist from Neum√ºnster was seriously injured with a knife. On December 6, 2008, the front man of the Hells Angels \\"Nomads\\", was brutally beaten in the nightclub \\"Omega\\" in Eberswalde. The perpetrators were members of the Chicanos, a support group of the Bandidos motorcycle gang. In February 2009, the Hells Angels published a statement about the mass brawl in Kiel, distancing itself from contacts to the right-wing scene. \\"The Hells Angels MC was, is and remains a non-politically motivated club\\" and \\"new members have to leave the right-wing scene\\", Frank Hanebuth, president of the Hannover Hells Angels, said in the statement. The attempt to draw the club into the right-wing haze is a personal insult for every member, the Hells Angels indicate. \\"We have eight different nations in our club. One comes from Israel, one from Palestine, one even from Surinam. And we are xenophobic?\\", he asked. On June 5, 2009, the clubhouse of the Chicanos was completely destroyed from inside. Several members of the Chicanos suffered skull fractures and elbow fractures. The attackers belong to the notorious \\"Brigade 81\\". On July 17, 2009, a passer-by discovered a glittering silver object under a black BMW in Eberswalde. Reports say the object was a homemade bomb and the car belonged to the president of the local Chicanos. In August 2009, a leading member of the Berlin Bandidos was stabbed and shot to death in Hohensch√∂nhausen, Berlin. A news channel claimed, the 33-year-old Michael B., was a well known outlaw motorcyclist in the district of Lichtenberg, Berlin, the President of the Berlin chapter of the Bandidos MC, and former member of the Hells Angels. Police reports say there is a continuing war over territorial claims between the Bandidos and the Hells Angels. In October 2009, at the opening ceremony of a new Hells Angels pub in Potsdam, 70 police officers controlled 159 persons, 39 vehicles and arrested one member, who was a fugitive belonging to the Hells Angels group \\"Nomads.\\" The man was wanted for violation of the Arms Act. Two baseball bats and a banned one-handed knife were also found. Since December 22, 2009, two members of the Hells Angels stood trial in Kaiserslautern. They were accused, along with another Hells Angels member, who was previously a fugitive, of having allegedly murdered the 45-year-old President of the Donnersberg Outlaws MC in June 2009. Also in December 2009, a 38-year-old member of the Hells Angels was stabbed and critically injured in Erfurt. Shortly after the attack, the police arrested four suspects in Weimar, including two members of the Jena Bandidos. In January 2010, the President of the Flensburg Hells Angels was arrested, accused of attempted homicide and hit-and-run driving, by having hit a Bandidos member with his car on the A7, reports say. On the same day, police raided the homes of two other Hells Angels members. Investigators searched for additional evidence in connection with the discovery of a weapons depot in a car repair shop in Flensburg. In November 2009, police had discovered explosives, five machine guns, ten shotguns and pump guns, revolvers and pistols and lots of ammunition. In February 2010 in Potsdam, about 70 supporters of the Berlin chapter of the Bandidos MC, who usually are hostile to the Hells Angels, moved to the Berlin chapter of the Hells Angels. Police reports say the background of this step is unknown. Specialists say it could have something to do with a fight on June 21, 2009 in Finowfurt where one motorcyclist's leg was badly injured with an axe and the President of the \\"Brigade 81\\", Andr√© S., was stabbed in the back. Other sources say it could have something to do with the immigrant background of the Berlin chapter of the Bandidos. German Bandidos probably have a problem with members of foreign origin. In general, it was claimed that the outlaw motorcyclists were nationalistic and felt they were \\"real German men\\", therefore members with Turkish roots were not welcome. A leading Hells Angels member confirmed the defection and said the new members will be part of \\"Hells Angels Turkey.\\" On March 15, 2010, a 21-year-old supporter of the Bandidos was stabbed and badly injured in Kiel. In the same night, police raided meeting points of the Hells Angels. A few days earlier, shots were fired at the house of the local Hells Angels leader. On March 17, 2010, a Bonn Hells Angels member shot dead a 42-year-old police officer of the SEK (Spezialeinsatzkommando) during a house search. He was subsequently acquitted of murder charges by the German Supreme court, stating that he acted in self- defense after murder threats by Bandido members. Since March 2010, a Hells Angels member has been standing trial in Duisburg for having murdered an Oberhausen Bandidos member in Hochfeld, Duisburg on October 8, 2009 who was executed with a headshot in its red-light district. In April 2010, a member of the Flensburg Hells Angels, who is a witness in a double murder case and a businessman are accused having extorted ‚Ç¨380,000 from another businessman who, after a dispute with his wife, stabbed her and his 7-year-old daughter to death then set his house on fire in February 2009. The background to the crimes were caused by economic difficulties. In May 2010, the warring gangs declared an armistice, but investigators doubt whether hostilities will cease. On May 3, 2012, the Cologne chapter of the Hells Angels MC was forcefully disbanded and all property of the chapter was confiscated by the North Rhine- Westphalia ministry of home affairs. On the same morning the North Rhine- Westphalian Police raided and searched 32 homes of its members. No arrests were made, however the public display of chapter symbols and the wearing of its regalia were banned. the support club Red Devils MC Cologne was also banned. The North Rhine-Westphalian interior minister justified these actions by saying \\"The Hells Angels intentionally ignore the basic values of our society. They close themselves off from society, set up their own rules and practice vigilante justice\\". The previous week similar action was taken against the nearby Aachen chapter of the Bandidos M.C.. On May 29, 2012, the Berlin City Chapter of Hells Angels MC was disbanded and a raid was started. Allegations of an information leak inside the Berlin ministry of home affairs about the upcoming measures were made. Eight members of the Hells Angels' Berlin charter, including the chapter president Kadir Padir, were sentenced to life in prison by a Berlin court in 2019 for the murder of Tahrir √ñzbek, a rival gangster with whom Padir was in a long-running conflict.Hells Angels sentenced for murder in Berlin On 10 January 2014, a group of thirteen Hells Angels stormed a Berlin bookmaker's shop, with one of them shooting √ñzbek six times. One other Hells Angels member was handed a shortened prison sentence of twelve years after he cooperated with investigators.Berlin: Eight Hells Angels sentenced to life imprisonment In early October 2016, Giessen Chapter boss Aygun Mucuk was shot dead at the chapter clubhouse, reportedly the result of a rivalry between the Giessen Hells Angels, whose membership is largely of Turkish origin, and the long-established Hells Angels chapter in nearby Frankfurt. Hundreds of Hells Angels members gathered to ride in honor at his funeral. Netherlands The Hells Angels control much of the drug trade in the Netherlands, and are also involved in prostitution. The Dutch police have stated that the Hells Angels smuggle cocaine into the country through terrorist organizations and drug cartels in Cura√ßao and Colombia, and also deal in ecstasy and illegal firearms. Hells Angels member Louis Hagemann, who had over a hundred previous convictions including armed robbery, rape and attempted murder, was convicted of the 1984 murder of a mother and her two daughters in February 2003. After strangling Corina Bolhaar, he stabbed nine- year-old Donna and six-year-old Sharon. Hagemann was cleared of murdering Northern Irish woman Joanne Wilson in Amsterdam in 1985 due to insufficient evidence.CLEARED & JAILED; Judges say Hell's Angel didn't kill Jo but he murdered family. In October 2005, the Dutch police raided Hells Angels' clubhouses in Amsterdam, Haarlem, IJmuiden, Harlingen, Kampen and Rotterdam as well as a number of houses. Belgian police also raided two locations over the border. Police seized a grenade launcher, a flame thrower, hand grenades, 20 hand guns, a machine pistol and ‚Ç¨70,000 (US$103,285) in cash. A number of Hells Angels members were later imprisoned on charges of international trafficking of cocaine and ecstasy, the production and distribution of marijuana, money laundering and murder, after an investigation that lasted over a year.45 Hell's Angels members arrested on suspicion of weapons and drugs trafficking In 2006 two Dutch newspapers reported that the Amsterdam brothel Yab Yum had long been controlled by the Dutch Hells Angels, who had taken over after a campaign of threats and blackmailing.Yab Yum: exclusief √©n crimineel, BN DeStem, May 3, 2006; 'Ook sekshuis Yab Yum werd afgeperst'. Eindhovens Dagblad, May 3, 2006. The city council of Amsterdam revoked the license of Yab Yum in December 2007. During a subsequent trial the city's attorney repeated these allegations and the brothel's attorney denied them.'Hells Angels own Yab Yum brothel', DutchNews.nl, January 3, 2008 The brothel was closed in January 2008.Amsterdam court says Yab Yum brothel must close, Reuters, January 4, 2008 Twenty-three bikers were arrested following a fight between Hells Angels and Mongols, in which several gunshots were fired and one person wounded, at the Van der Valk hotel in Rotterdam on April 7, 2016. On May 29, 2019 the Hells Angels were banned in the Netherlands. This is the first country in the world to outlaw the entire club.

Norway Due to the extent of the criminal activities of HAMC in Norway, Kripos, the criminal investigation unit of the Norwegian police, considers the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club to be a criminal organisation. In 2011 the presumed leader of HAMC Norway Leif Ivar Kristiansen was convicted of threats, robbery and severe drug crimes, and sentenced to four years and nine months in prison. In another case he was found guilty of fencing and tax evasion, and a number of smaller charges. According to numbers from Kripos in 2012, 120 Hells Angels-members have been convicted 400 times for about 1000 violations of the Norwegian penal code. The convictions include violence, rape, severe drug criminality and threats. In 2010, 2011 and 2013 the police conducted raids on the HAMC headquarters in Oslo and confiscated a number of illegal weapons in all the raids. The police demanded in October 2013 that the headquarters be seized as they believe the house is being used as a staging ground for organized criminal activities. Portugal In 2018 Portuguese authorities publicly declared that they found strong evidence of potential gang violence events against Bandidos, a rival motorcycle club, specifically against M√°rio Machado, once the leader of the Portuguese Hammerskins, who is suspected to be a member of the latter. Around 80 search warrants and dozens of arrest arrests were issued. In July 2019, Portuguese prosecutors charged 89 members of Hells Angels with involvement in organized crime, attempted murder, robbery, drug trafficking, qualified extortion and possession of illegal weapons and ammunition.Portugal charges 89 Hells Angels bikers after Lisbon attack South Africa The first Hells Angels chapter in South Africa was founded in Johannesburg on 14 August 1993.Les Gangs de Motards Criminalis√©s: Une expansion internationale Xavier Raufer, Institut de Criminologie de Paris An international drug smuggling ring involving Hells Angels in South Africa and the United States was allegedly established in November 1999 and uncovered by police in Arizona in 2001. The amphetamine \\"South African Brown\\", hidden in stuffed toys, was speed mailed from South Africa to Flagstaff, Arizona, from where it was distributed to other US states. South Africans Peter Conway, vice-president of the Hells Angels Nomad chapter, and Michael \\"Jethro\\" Hall, former president, and a number of American members were charged with the smuggling. American Hells Angel Greg Surdukan pleaded guilty to charges and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison by a Phoenix judge in June 2002. The US authorities had less success prosecuting the South Africans; Hall was shot dead during a burglary at his Johannesburg home in May 2002,US cops hunt SA Hell's Angel and Conway emigrated to the United Kingdom before he could face charges where he died in November 2018, aged fifty-two.Peter Conway ‚Äì Hells Angel, spy, mercenary, drug smuggler Hells Angels member Alexander Bely, a former Soviet citizen who immigrated to South Africa in the late 1980s, was arrested in 2006 before being extradited to Russia in February 2013, alleged to have organized the delivery of 224 kilograms of ephedrine to the country between 2003 and 2005 and laundering over ‚ÇΩ34.5 million (around $1.2 million). Bely, along with Andrei Bykov and Bykov's spouse, cousin, adopted daughter and her husband, allegedly obtained the drug from the Hells Angels in South Africa and delivered it to St. Petersburg, passing it off as bath salts. In May 2005, Bykov's wife fled to South Africa, seeking to avoid criminal prosecution. The group then began delivering ephedrine under the guise of detergent. In 2008, three accomplices of Bykov and Bely were found guilty and sentenced to prison terms. Andrei Bykov and his wife Yevgenia were extradited in 2009 and received 14- and 18-year sentences, respectively. Spain Spanish police carried out a number of raids against the club on April 21, 2009, arresting 22 members in Barcelona, Valencia, M√°laga, Madrid and Las Palmas. Two of them were members of the club's Italian chapters. The Hells Angels arrested were charged with drugs and weapons trafficking, and extortion. Law enforcement seized military- style weapons and ammunition, bulletproof vests, a kilo of cocaine, neo-Nazi literature and ‚Ç¨200,000 in cash during the searches of 30 properties. One suspect also attempted to use a firearm against police officers as he was being arrested. It was part of an investigation into the club, known as Valkiria, which began in October 2007 and also led to eight arrests in December 2007. Prior to this, the only operation against the club in Spain took place in March 1996. On October 12, 2011, a club owned by the Hells Angels in Barcelona, The other place, was attacked by anti-fascists while a Nazi concert organized by the far-right party Democracia Nacional was held there. Members of the Spanish Charter were involved in a killing and tried.http://www.abc.es/local-alicante/20140114/abci-condenados-nueve- motoristas-angeles-201401141805.html Sweden Sweden is home to twelve Hells Angels chapters with 170 members and 230 official supporters. In 2012, the Swedish television network TV4 compiled a report which alleged that the Hells Angels had been convicted of 2,800 crimes in the country, including 420 violent crimes. The Hells Angels also featured in the ITV documentary Police Camera Action! on the 1996 episode International Patrol where footage from the Rigspolitiet was shown of an individual carrying a knife, who was later arrested. Thailand Since 2012, Thailand has hosted Hells Angels nomads ‚Äì members not affiliated with any particular regional chapter. A Pattaya chapter was founded in April 2016. It was reported in 2017 that the club has fourteen fully patched members in the country ‚Äì five Australians, four Germans, a Canadian and four Thais.Hells Angels: Founding member of Thai chapter bashed as Australian bikies take over 'dark business' Australian Hells Angels member Luke Joshua Cook and his Thai wife Kanyarat Wedphitak were sentenced to death in November 2018 after being found guilty of attempting to smuggle half a ton of methamphetamine from China into Thailand on board a yacht in June 2015.Australian ‚ÄòHells Angels‚Äô member, Thai wife sentenced to death for drug smuggling Thai authorities have stated that Cook, a member of the Pattaya chapter with links to Hells Angels in Sydney, was paid $10 million (‡∏ø320 million) by the club to smuggle the drugs for later shipment to Australia.Australian man and Thai wife sentenced to death over $300m drug bust Wayne Schneider, a high-ranking Australian member of the Hells Angels in Thailand, was abducted at gunpoint outside his villa in Pattaya on November 30, 2015 and taken to a flat where he was tied to a chair and beaten to death by five other Hells Angels.

Bagnato also fled the country after the 2014 murder of Sydney man Bradley Dillon for which he is a suspect. Turkey On July 30, 2010, the European police agency Europol issued a warning on an increase of Hells Angels and Bandidos activities in Southeast Europe and Turkey. The newly founded Hells Angels Turkey denied the warning's content, calling the relevant report \\"utter nonsense\\" and alleging Europol officials are after more European Union funds. On July 2, 2011, around 20 Hells Angels Turkey members in Kadƒ±k√∂y, Istanbul attacked people in a bar and injured seven of them (two severely) pleading that these people were drinking alcohol on the street and disturbing the neighbourhood. It had been earlier reported that Turkish defectors from Bandidos Germany chapter have joined the ranks of Hells Angels Turkey. United Kingdom The first two Hells Angels charters in the United Kingdom were issued in London in July 1969. It was reported in 1995 that the group has 12 chapters and an estimated 250 members in the country. The National Criminal Intelligence Service stated that the Hells Angels in the UK have been involved in the cannabis and amphetamine trade, as well as prostitution, theft and extortion, and also accused a small group of them of being responsible for more assaults and murders than any other organized group in the country. Investigators have alleged the British Hells Angels have links to drug cartels in South America and Mexico, as well as Northern Ireland paramilitary groups, the IRA and the UDA. =England= In November 1972, three Hells Angels were sentenced to prison for their part in the rape of a 14-year-old girl who was seized from the street and sexually assaulted in front of laughing teenagers in a local caf√© in Winchester. Ian \\"Moose\\" Everest was convicted of raping the girl and sentenced to seven years, while Stephen \\"Boots\\" Ripley and Anthony \\"Chas\\" Mann were each given four years for aiding and abetting Everest. A group of up to 30 Hells Angels ambushed 15 members of an unsanctioned Windsor \\"Hells Angels\\" chapter who were sleeping in a car park near Brockenhurst in April 1979. Richard Sharman, the leader of the Windsor chapter, survived being shot three times in the head and another man received a shotgun wound to the buttocks. 24 Hells Angels were jailed or given suspended sentences for the attack in 1980. The Windsor chapter officially became Hells Angels in 1985. Members of the Hells Angels' Lea Valley chapter were involved in a mass brawl with a group from the Luton Town MIGs hooligan firm at the Blockers Arms public house in Luton in May 1990. The MIGs gained the upper hand, forcing the Hells Angels from the pub. With further violence seeming inevitable, undercover police officers were assigned to observe key figures on both sides. However, the MIGs decided to pay the Hells Angels ¬£2,000 in compensation rather than face the continued threat of retaliation. The Hells Angels became involved in a dispute between a Dutch drug trafficker and a Liverpool crime family in late 1992. The Liverpudlian gang had made a significant down payment on a large shipment of cannabis from Amsterdam which was seized by British customs officials during a routine check of a Dutch- registered ship docking at Manchester. Under the terms of the agreement, the drugs were no longer the responsibility of the Dutchman once they had left Dutch waters but the Liverpool family refused to pay the ¬£140,000 owed and so the trafficker, a former Hells Angel, contracted the club to collect the debt owed to him. Three Hells Angels, Michael \\"Long Mick\\" Rowledge (vice-president of the Hells Angels' Wolverhampton chapter), Andrew Trevis (also from Wolverhampton) and Stephen Pollock (from the Windsor chapter) travelled to Aintree on 7 October 1992 and agreed to meet the Liverpudlians outside a supermarket in the Old Roan area. While the Hells Angels waited in their car, a gunman approached and shot Rowledge four times in the chest, killing him, before escaping in a waiting vehicle. In 1993, Delroy Davies was acquitted after a trial at Liverpool Crown Court and Thomas Dures was jailed for 13 years for conspiracy to murder. Pierre Rodrigue and David Rouleau, two Canadian Hells Angels from the Sherbrooke chapter, were arrested by British police London at the request of the RCMP in February 1995 before being extradited to Canada and sentenced to 14 years imprisonment for conspiring to smuggle 558 kilograms of cocaine into the UK in a scheme also involving the Rizzuto crime family and Colombian cartels. The Hells Angels waged a two-year turf war with the Outcasts, who are centred in London and East Anglia, during the late 1990s. The dispute between the two clubs is believed to have begun when the Outcasts tried to absorb a small Hertfordshire club, The Lost Tribe, in June 1997. Concerned that such a move would make the Outcasts their equal in numbers, the Hells Angels made The Lost Tribe honorary members. That November, two members of the Outcasts were arrested in possession of loaded shotguns, allegedly on their way to confront the Hells Angels. On 31 January 1998, Outcasts members David Armstrong and Malcolm St Clair were killed in a clash with up to twenty Hells Angels at a concert in Battersea, London. Armstrong was dragged from his motorcycle and hacked to death with axes and knives; St Clair raced to his aid but was stabbed eight times. Ronald \\"Gut\\" Wait, president of the Hells Angels' Essex chapter, was convicted of conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm and sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment in relation to the incident. The 18st (114 kg) Wait died in prison of a heart attack in 2001. In March 1999, a fertilizer and petrol bomb was found at the clubhouse of the Hells Angels' Lea Valley chapter and there was an attempted arson attack on a motorcycle shop owned by the Angels. Two Outcasts were then shot close to their east London clubhouse. Both survived but refused to co-operate with police. The Outlaws, who have around 150 British members across 14 chapters mainly based in the West Midlands, have since become the Hells Angels' main rivals in the UK since opening chapters in the country in 2000. Hells Angels member Gerry Tobin was shot dead as he rode his motorcycle home to London, where he worked as a Harley-Davidson service manager, from the Bulldog Bash in Warwickshire on 12 August 2007. Two bullets were fired from a Rover car which drove up alongside him as he sped down the M40 motorway, one hitting him in the head. Seven members of the Outlaws, the entire South Warwickshire chapter, were convicted over his murder and sentenced to a total of 191 years in prison. It is believed that Tobin was killed due to the fact that the Hells Angels-run Bulldog Bash is held in Outlaws territory, and that the killing may have been sanctioned by Outlaws leadership in the United States. A brawl between up to thirty Hells Angels and Outlaws members took place at Birmingham International Airport on 20 January 2008 after the two groups had found themselves together on a flight from Alicante, Spain, with police recovering various weapons including knuckledusters, hammers, a machete and a meat cleaver. Three Hells Angels and four Outlaws were convicted as a result. Hells Angels member Dennis Taskin was jailed for six years and nine months after admitting illegally possessing ammunition and five guns as well as cocaine, amphetamines and morphine. Police had found an Uzi, three revolvers and an antique pistol as well as dum-dum bullets and drugs when they raided a flat rented by Taskin in Hove on 26 December 2009. Stuart Manners, a member of the Hells Angels' Cadishead chapter, was jailed for twelve years after being convicted of selling a Smith & Wesson 9mm handgun and 21 bullets to Liverpool criminal Darren Alcock and his associate Paul Estridge in Stockport in August 2012. Alcock and Estridge were both sentenced to 14 years. In January 2019, Matthew Barnes, president of the Sussex chapter of the Hells Angels, was formally cleared of allegedly assaulting Christopher \\"Swaggers\\" Harrison. Harrison alleged that he had been assaulted by Barnes and other Hells Angels members after refusing to join the club when he was found unconscious and with his eyes ruptured outside a pub in Hastings in February 2016.Sussex Hells Angel President cleared over Hastings attack that partially blinded man Barnes' co-defendant Oliver Wilkinson was also acquitted following a trial in August 2018.Hells Angels biker cleared of Hastings assault Hells Angels member David Wyeth, along with an accomplice, carried out an assault and attempted to steal the colours of a member of the Vikings Motorcycle Club in Maidstone, Kent on 7 May 2018.

The conflict between the groups allegedly began when the Hells Angels sought to open a chapter in Surrey and tried to entice the Wargs into switching their allegiance from the Vikings to the Hells Angels. When it became clear that the Vikings would resist any attempt to persuade the Wargs to leave them, the Hells Angels decided to launch an attack.Hells Angels prospects convicted over Blindley Heath attack that put six rival bikers in hospital A Hells Angels member allegedly assaulted a toilet attendant after being caught using cocaine in a pub in Maidstone on 18 May 2019.

The Hells Angels' West Wales chapter clubhouse in Haverfordwest was raided by police in September 2007, with the police finding a handgun fitted with a silencer loaded with a full magazine of bullets. Gary Young, a probationary club member, was charged with possessing the weapon; he denied the charge and was found not guilty. He was later granted a conditional discharge for two years after admitting possessing a firearm without a certificate, possessing an offensive weapon and possessing three amounts of cannabis, charges which stemmed from several further police raids on his home during the initial investigation. Young was expelled from the Hells Angels due to the club taking exception to him \\"naming names\\" about who was whom within the West Wales chapter. Neil Lake needed three metal plates inserted in his face after being attacked by a Hells Angel at a petrol station in Cardiff in October 2007. Lake took down the registration of his attacker's Harley- Davidson motorcycle which led police to Sean Timmins, the vice-president of the Wolverhampton chapter. Timmins denied inflicting grievous bodily harm on Lake and claimed that a fellow club member had been riding around with the same number plates as him; he told a judge he knew the identity of the actual attacker but explained that it would be against club rules for him to name him. Timmins was cleared of the charge in September 2008 after providing an alibi who said that he was working in his hometown on the day of the attack. He would later be one of the three Hells Angels jailed for six years after the brawl with the Outlaws at Birmingham Airport. Hells Angels members Stephen Jones and Raymond Scaddan were cleared of violent behavior, while former member Andrew McCann was also found not guilty of violent disorder but convicted of using threatening, abusive, insulting words or behavior at Newport Crown Court on 1 November 2015. Jones and Scaddan maintained that they went to McCann's home in Newport on 24 January 2015 to collect money for a ¬£2,000 gold necklace that had been given to him and that they had acted in self-defence after an alleged attack by McCann and his son. McCann, who left the club in 2014 after a dispute, claimed the two Hells Angels had come to extort ¬£5,000 from him. United States A National Drug Intelligence Center report on the Hells Angels. The Hells Angels are designated an outlaw motorcycle gang by the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

The Grateful Dead were also scheduled to perform but cancelled at the last minute owing to the ensuing circumstances at the venue. The Angels had been hired by The Rolling Stones as crowd security for a fee which was said to include $500 worth of beer.Sol Stern, Ramparts Magazine March 1970 The Angels parked their motorcycles in front of the stage in order to create a buffer between the stage and the hundreds of thousands of concertgoers. Crowd management proved to be difficult, resulting in both spectator injury and death. Over the course of the day, the Hells Angels became increasingly agitated as the crowd turned more aggressive. At a later murder trial of Hells Angel Alan Passaro, a security guard testified he heard the Hells Angels being summoned over the loudspeakers when the helicopter bearing The Rolling Stones landed. Debate after the event was over whether the Hells Angels were to manage security for the entire concert or just for The Rolling Stones. Sam Cutler, the Stones' agent who had arranged to pay the Hells Angels said their role was as bodyguards to the Rolling Stones. This was denied by the Hells Angels as well as others connected to the event. During the opening act of Santana, the Hells Angels surged into the crowd numerous times to keep persons off stage.The Capital, April 20, 1970 By the time The Rolling Stones took stage, numerous incidents of violence had occurred both between the Hells Angels and internally within the crowd, not the least of which featured a circus performer weighing over 350 pounds stripping naked and running amok amid the concertgoers. Audience members attempted to detain him. Eventually, the irate man was subdued after Angels intervened with fists and makeshift weapons, while a crowd of 4,000‚Äì5,000 looked on from the edge of the stage. The aggression did not subside there. After an Angel's motorcycle was toppled, club members' tempers continued to escalate, their ire spread wide between the audience and performers alike. At one point, Marty Balin of Jefferson Airplane was knocked unconscious following an altercation with an Angel, an event later depicted in Gimme Shelter. The Grateful Dead refused to play following the Balin incident, and left the venue. A shoving match erupted near the stage during a rendition of the song \\"Under My Thumb\\". As the song began, a man in the audience, Meredith Hunter, was allegedly harassed, then violently pushed back by the Hells Angels. He returned, producing a handgun. Hunter was stabbed to death. A Hells Angel member, Alan Passaro, was later acquitted of murder on grounds of self-defense. After the concert and critical media attention given to the HAMC, Sonny Barger went on a local California radio station to justify the actions of the Hells Angels and to present their side of the story. He claimed that violence only started once the crowd began vandalizing the Hells Angels' motorcycles. Barger would later claim that Hunter fired a shot which struck a Hells Angels member with what he described as \\"just a flesh wound.\\"Barger, Sonny; Zimmerman, Keith; and Zimmerman, Kent Hell's Angels: The Life and Times of Sonny Barger and the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club.

Bonner, infiltrated the club for twenty-six months and made drug transactions with numerous chapters as part of the investigation, which resulted in the indictments of a total of 133 Hells Angels members and associates in eleven states on narcotics trafficking and racketeering charges. The raids, involving approximately a thousand law enforcement personnel, also led to the seizure of cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine, hashish, PCP and LSD valued at $2 million, as well as weapons including submachine guns and anti-tank weaponry. Fifteen Hells Angels members and associates were arrested in the Omaha area on October 17, 1990 after being indicted on charges including interstate and foreign travel in support of racketeering enterprises, money laundering, manufacturing and distribution of a controlled substance, and felony possession of a firearm.

As a result, Mongol Anthony Barrera, 43, was stabbed to death, and two Hells Angels, Jeramie Bell, 27, and Robert Tumelty, 50, were shot to death. On February 23, 2007 Hells Angels members James Hannigan and Rodney Cox were sentenced to two years in prison. Cox and Hannigan were captured on videotape confronting Mongols members inside the casino. A Hells Angel member can be clearly seen on the casino security videotape performing a front kick on a Mongol biker member, causing the ensuing melee. However, prior to this altercation, several incidents of harassment and provocation were noted in the Clark County, Nevada Grand Jury hearings as having been perpetrated upon The Hells Angels. Members of the Mongols accosted a vendor's table selling Hells Angels trademarked items, had surrounded a Hells Angel and demanded he remove club clothing. In addition, nine witnesses claimed the fight began when a Mongol kicked a member of the Hells Angels. Regardless of which minor physical incident can be said to have \\"caused the melee\\", it is clear that The Hells Angels had come to confront the Mongols concerning their actions. Attorneys for the Hells Angels claimed that the Hells Angels were defending themselves from an attack initiated by the Mongols. Charges were dismissed against 36 other Hells Angels originally named in the indictment. =New Hampshire= Eleven members of the Hells Angels' Lowell, Massachusetts chapter were arrested on narcotics-related charges during a raid by twenty-six federal, state and local law enforcement officers on a dwelling in Nashua on September 9, 1969.

In September 1994, near Buffalo at the Lancaster Speedway drag races, there was a clash between the Hells Angels and a rival biker gang resulting in two deaths, and multiple injuries. On January 28, 2007 a woman named Roberta Shalaby was found badly beaten on the sidewalk outside the Hells Angels' clubhouse at 77 East Third Street in the East Village, Manhattan. The resulting investigation by the NYPD has been criticized by the group for its intensity. The police were refused access to the Hells Angels clubhouse and responded by closing off the area, setting up sniper positions, and sending in an armored personnel carrier. After obtaining a warrant, the police searched the clubhouse and arrested one Hells Angel who was later released. The group claims to have no connection with the beating of Shalaby. Five security cameras cover the entrance to the New York chapter's East 3rd Street club house, but the NY HAMC maintains nobody knows how Shalaby was beaten nearly to death at their front door.

At the time, Finazzo was considered by police to be among the ten most powerful members of the club.

Investigators believe that the Hells Angels themselves destroyed the property before their departure.Bikers‚Äô Clubhouse Vacated, Destroyed Wilson Times (August 15, 1985) =Ohio= The United States Department of Justice has stated that the Hells Angels have been involved in contract killings and drug trafficking with the Cleveland crime family. The New York chapter of the Hells Angels was involved in a large-scale brawl with the Breed, in which knives, chains and clubs were brandished, at a motorcycle trade show in Cleveland on March 6, 1971.The Nation: Hell's Angels 4, Breed 1 Time (March 22, 1971) The violence led to the deaths of five bikers; Breed members Bruce Emerick, Andrew Demeter, Amelio Gardull and Thomas A.

The deposit bag contained about $4000 in cash and was not taken. Three members of Hells Angels motorcycle gang; Steven Wayne Yee, Mark Verdi, and John Ray Bonds were carrying out a hit. Cleveland Hells Angels were planning to retaliate against a Sandusky Outlaw gang member for the Joliet, IL shooting of an Hells Angels member the previous year, at which Bonds had been present. The Outlaw member drove a van almost identical to Hartlaub's. The trio mistook Hartalub's van for their enemy's and shot and killed him by mistake. Both the gun and the van's carpet were spattered with blood, allowing police to use DNA evidence, and discovered that John Ray Bonds was the shooter who had hid inside Hartlaub's van and was waiting to kill him. He shot him with a MAC-11 9-mm semi-automatic pistol fitted with a homemade silencer. Bond's DNA profile analyzed by the FBI matched the bloodstains found in Yee's car and based on this they were able to use it as key evidence. This was one of the first cases of DNA being used for criminal conviction. The trial and legal wrangling lasted nearly two years and ended in long prison terms for all three Hells Angels members, who may remain in prison on sentences up to life. =Oregon= Police have stated that the Hells Angels have avoided Oregon since 1967, when the state was ceded to the Gypsy Jokers to quell a San Francisco-area drug war between the clubs.

Odis \\"Buck\\" Garrett, the Hells Angels Vallejo (California) chapter president, ordered the killings of Compton and her daughters in retaliation for her testimony against several Hells Angels in a 1976 San Francisco prostitution trial. Garrett, a one-time millionaire methamphetamine dealer already serving a life term in California on a narcotics conviction, was found guilty on four counts of murder and sentenced to four consecutive life sentences in prison in July 1995.When Jailbirds Sing / It was the pure savagery of the four killings, which included the cold-blooded execution of 6-year-old twins, that led dozens of California's most notorious criminals to testify in a murder that had gone unsolved for 18 years Garrett died in prison aged seventy-four on February 12, 2017.Federal inmate registry =Pennsylvania= An alliance between the Pagans and the Philadelphia crime family has historically prevented the Hells Angels from establishing a presence in the Philadelphia area.

On October 31, 2005, Pagans members allegedly stole a sign standing in front of the Hells Angels' clubhouse, resulting in an exchange of gunfire. The Philadelphia Hells Angels chapter, consisting of twelve members and approximately five prospects, was disbanded during a meeting in New York on November 18, 2005.

Authorities then obtained warrants to search a storage unit in nearby Rock Hill, where they uncovered a booby-trapped stockpile of weapons consisting of C-4 explosive, grenades, ammunition and two fully-automatic submachine guns equipped with silencers. The ATF was called in to investigate the seizure, and an Army explosive ordnance disposal unit from Fort Jackson was required to disarm the trap. On January 6, 1983, Scarnechia and Campbell were sentenced to five years in prison for assaulting Landrum. Sixteen members and associates of the Hells Angels' South Carolina Nomads chapter, which operated from clubhouses in Lexington and Rock Hill, were convicted of crimes related to the RICO Act following a two-year cooperative investigation by the FBI, ATF, South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) and four local police departments. The investigation revealed that the group engaged in drug dealing, money laundering, firearms trafficking, violent crimes, attempted armed robbery, arson, and other offenses.

A friend of the poets Anna Akhmatova and Osip Mandelstam, her physical and intellectual charms were celebrated in their poetry and inspired other writers such as Grigol Robakidze and Ilia Zdanevich, as well as the artists Boris Grigoriev, Alexandre Jacovleff and Zinaida Serebriakova.Smith, G. S. & Stone, G. C. (1998), Oxford Slavonic Papers: New Series. Volume XXX, p. 90. Oxford University Press, . In exile she lived in Georgia (1917-1919), France (1919-1940), the United States of America (1940-1947) and Britain (1947-1982). Family Salomea Ivanovna Andronikova was born in Tiflis (now Tbilisi, Georgia) in October 1888 into the family of the Georgian prince Ivane Andronikashvili (1863‚Äì1944) and his Russian wife Lidiya Pleshcheyeva-Muratova (1861‚Äì1953), a relative of the poet Aleksey Pleshcheyev. Salomea's real patronymic was \\"Ivanovna\\", but she thought that somewhat vulgar and adopted \\"Nikolayevna\\" instead. The Andronikashvili family claimed descent from a natural son of the Eastern Roman Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos.Kelsey Jackson Williams (2006), A Genealogy of the Grand Komnenoi of Trebizond. Foundations - the Journal of the Foundation for Medieval Genealogy ‚Äì Vol. 2, No. 3. Salomea also had a sister, Maria (1891‚Äì1976), and a brother, Jesse (1893‚Äì1937), who became a White Russian officer and was killed in 1937 during Joseph Stalin's rule. St. Petersburg and emigration Princess Salomea Andronikova, by Boris Grigoriev In 1906, at the age of 18, Salomea moved from Tiflis to St. Petersburg. There she married the tea businessman Pavel Andreyev, and gave birth to a daughter Irina. Her salon hosted, among others, the poets Anna Akhmatova and Osip Mandelstam. After divorcing Andreyev, Salomea had a 7-year affair with the Russian poet Sergey Rafalovich. After the revolutionary turmoil in Petrograd in 1917 Salomea and Rafalovich fled to her native Georgia. She settled in Tiflis, and co-edited the Russian-language literary monthly Orion. Here she began a love affair with Zinovy Peshkov, a French diplomat of Russian background. In 1919 she fled with Peshkov to Paris. She helped the Russian artist Zinaida Serebriakova escape from Soviet Russia, and supported the poet Marina Tsvetaeva during her forced exile in Europe.Feiler, Lily (1994), Marina Tsvetaeva: The Double Beat of Heaven and Hell, p. 178. Duke University Press, But when her brother's wife and their son Constantin fled to France in 1920, her brother was imprisoned in Russia by the Bolsheviks, and he later died in captivity. In 1925 Salomea married the Menshevik lawyer Alexander Galpern, a Russian √©migr√© to London and a close friend of Alexander Kerensky; but the couple lived separately. She worked for the fashion magazines of Lucien Vogel. During World War II she remained in Paris until 1940, when she moved to the United States of America, where Galpern served at the British embassy. She took her grandson with her, but her daughter Irina, baroness Nolde, a member of the French Resistance, remained in Nazi German captivity. After the War, Salomea moved back to Europe, and in 1947 settled in London. There she remained until her death on 8 May 1982, at the age of 94 - in a house which had been purchased for her by the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin. –õ–æ–±–∞–Ω–æ–≤- –†–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –ù. –î–º. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è: –ü–æ—Ä—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç –°–∞–ª–æ–º–µ–∏ –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤–æ–π —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—ã –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–∞ –Ø–∫–æ–≤–ª–µ–≤–∞ . –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –ì–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞. 03.31.2005, ‚Ññ12(83).

He was imprisoned due to opposing the Communist government policies and was killed while imprisoned and had been noted during his episcopate for his attentiveness to vocations and to the defense of the faith from those forces that sought to disrupt it such as communism. His beatification took place in 2011. Life J√°nos Scheffler was born on 29 October 1887 in K√°lm√°nd in the Austro-Hungarian empire as the second of ten children but became a Romanian citizen after the Trianon accords in 1920. His brother was Franz Scheffler (3 October 1894 - 29 October 1956). In 1897 he began to feel called to become a priest though did not begin an active pursuit of this dream until 1906 since he began his high school studies in 1898 with the Jesuits. In 1906 he began his theological studies at the college in Budapest where he achieved excellent grandes. Scheffler was later ordained to the priesthood in 1910. He was first assigned to Ciume»ôti while that October saw him sent to Rome to the Pontifical Gregorian University to learn canon law where he soon became a doctor of law on 19 June 1912 upon his graduation. In July 1914 - as World War I was beginning - he became a professor of theological studies and the dean of students at Satu Mare. In November 1915 he received his scientific degree. In 1922 with the Satu Mare and Oradea Mare dioceses being merged he set up a single college becoming its first dean as well as professor of canon law and historical studies. In 1923 he became a parish priest at Moftinu Mare. In 1925 he started teaching seminarians for the priesthood and attended the Eucharistic Congress in Chicago from 20‚Äì24 June 1926. In 1939 he became a spiritual director. In 1942 he was elected to be the Bishop of Satu Mare but In November 1945 was transferred as the Bishop of Gy≈ër though was not installed because he preferred to remain in his previous diocese; but he was transferred for the last time in 1948 to another diocese. Vocations became his principal concern and so he founded the \\"Opus Vocationum Ecclesiasticum\\" for the care and cultivation of vocations while also establishing several minor seminaries. After World War II he began to express opposition to government policies objecting to the deportation of Germans to the Soviet Union. He appealed for the release of Alexandru Rusu who was the Greek-Catholic Bishop of Maramure≈ü that the new communist regime had arrested. At the time 1950 began all bishops in Romania had been arrested and Scheffler himself was among the last being placed under house arrest on 23 May 1950. He refused an offer to become a bishop in a national church subjected to the regime and so was imprisoned as a result of this on 19 March 1952. He died at the Jilava prison in the morning of 6 December 1952 and was tortured after having boiling water poured onto him. News of his death reached Satu Mare in 1953 and his remains were buried in the Satu Mare Cathedral in 1965; an Orthodox priest had noted the location and had the remains moved since the late bishop had been placed in an unmarked grave. His remains were exhumed on 17 June 2011 and interred in another location in the Satu Mare Cathedal. Beatification The beatification process started on 12 December 1991 under Pope John Paul II after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" and titled Scheffler as a Servant of God. The diocesan process opened on 8 December 1994 and concluded a short time later on 5 December 1996 while the C.C.S. validated the process in Rome on 13 May 1998. The C.C.S. also received the Positio in 2002 for assessment which theologians approved on 1 July 2009 as did the C.C.S. on 20 April 2010. Pope Benedict XVI confirmed - on 1 July 2010 - that Scheffler was killed \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith) and thus approved his beatification which Cardinal Angelo Amato celebrated for the pope on 3 July 2011 in the bishop's old diocese. He was beatified in before 8000 people. Cardinal P√©ter Erd≈ë was also in attendance. Also attending were the nuncio Francisco-Javier Lozano Sebasti√°n and the Archbishop of Bucharest Ioan Robu as well as Cardinal Lucian Mure≈üan and both the Eger archbishop Csaba Terny√°k and the Alba Iulia archbishop Gy√∂rgy Jakubinyi.

They are freshwater fish that prefer clear to slightly turbid water. They are most often seen washed up on beaches and are rarely seen alive or correctly identified. They are found in rivers and lakes throughout North America.Bosanko, Dave (2007), \\"Fish of Minnesota ‚Äì Field Guide\\", pp. 162‚Äì163, Adventure Publication, Cambridge, MN. Its name comes from the Greek root words perc, meaning perch and opsi meaning appearance. The species name omiscomaycus is thought to be derived from a Native American word meaning trout. The trout-perch possess characteristics similar to both the trout and the perch.Bramblett, Robert, \\"Montana Cooperative Fishery Research Unit\\", Department of Ecology, Montana State University- Bozeman.http://www.fisheriessociety.org/AFSmontana/SSCpages/Trout-perch.htm They are an important source of food for many predator fish such as walleye, northern pike, and lake trout. They are a generally small fish found in deep waters by day, but which migrate to shallower waters at night. They are not a major human fishery, but are occasionally used as a bait fish. Description thumb The trout-perch has been found at sizes of total length and the average total length is . There are no distinguishing characteristics between males and females. They are overall silvery or nearly transparent in appearance with rows of dark spots on along the sides of their bodies both along their lateral line and above it. Their fins are almost entirely transparent. These fish have thick bodies with a long head, long snout, and a small mouth. They have a single dorsal fin containing 1‚Äì3 spines and 10‚Äì11 soft rays. They also have an adipose fin, similar to trout, which helps to distinguishes them from their look-alike species, the yellow perch and the walleye. Their tail or caudal fin is forked. Like most bony fishes, the trout-perch has thin, flexible plates of bone or leptoid scales. Their particular leptoid scales are ctenoid scales that are similar to the perch's. Distribution and habitat The trout-perch is found throughout North America, from Canada and Alaska to the Potomac river basin in Virginia. They are found in the Great lakes making them present in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. They are also found in the Mississippi River Basin which extends its range to include: Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. They have also been spotted in North Dakota, Montana and West Virginia. Trout-perch prefer clear to slightly turbid water with sandy and gravely bottoms. They avoid shallow soft-bottomed areas. They participate in a daily migration, traveling from deep water during the day to shallow waters at night. This behavior is not only very important to their predators; the walleye, the northern pike, and the lake trout, but also in transporting nutrients in thermally stratified lakes. The nocturnal migration allows for foraging under the cover of night. The trout-perch feeds on a variety of small invertebrates including insect larvae and crustaceans. Juveniles feed on zooplankton. Larger adults will eat small fish such as the johnny darter. Breeding The trout-perch becomes sexually mature at 1‚Äì3 years of age. The spawning season is May through August. The spawning site consists of sandbars and rocks in lakes or on gravel or sand in tributary streams. Three to four males will surround a single female and release their sperm as the female is releasing her eggs. The eggs will be fertilized and sink to the bottom of the lake. A single female can lay 200‚Äì700 eggs, which receive no parental care. The eggs will hatch in six days when the water temperature is . The life span of the trout-perch is around 4 years. Ecological Role Although the trout-perch are abundant fish, their ecological role have not been well studied and are still not well understood, yet it is believed the trout-perch plays an important role at maintaining the equilibrium of its habitat. A study was conducted in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron to learn about the ecological role of the trout-perch. Some results were collected, but there is still more to learn about this species. An important finding referred to the energy content of the trout-perch, which was higher than other similar species. The energy content of the trout-perch was 4795 joules, whereas yellow perch and round goby energy content were lower; 4662 joules and 3740 joules respectively. These findings are the main reason, scientists believe the trout-perch is an important source of food for other species in their habitat. Another finding showed that trout-perch prefer to feed from Chironomidae larvae (lake flies larvae), but during some months and trout-perch sizes, there was a slight difference in the feeding source. Bigger fish of this species preferred to feed on Amphipoda, whereas smaller fish feed on Zooplankton. Lake flies, lake flies larvae, and Amphipoda, seem to be the most important diet items for trout-perch in Saginaw Bay. The diet seemed to be the same for trout- perch in other systems besides Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Therefore, Trout-perch showed to be numerically important for the area since it seem to help to maintain the proper amount of species in its environment by serving as a food source and by preying on species, which are increasing and their increased can affect the ecosystem equilibrium. Parasites Trout- perch fish have been found infected by a variant of Myxobolus, which names is Myxobolus intramusculi and is a protist that acts as a muscular parasite. A study found that this strain of protist produces smaller (13-14.5 micrometres long vs 15-17 micrometres long), yet identical shape (narrow pyriform) spores than the original strain of protozoa and affects primarily within red and white muscle fibers and only rarely among the subdermal connective tissue in the trout-perch. The parasite grows until it replaces the entire content of the trout-perch cell and appears its developments stops abruptly before rupturing the outer cell membrane of the host cell which means it does not damage the cell significantly and does not have a lethal effect on the host. All the infected trout-perch seemed to have normal health and not any muscle deterioration. The only obvious effect of the parasite was a localized cyst on the area with infected cells. The parasites do not have lethal effects on trout-perch and these parasites cannot be transmitted from fish to humans.

It won the 2012 Man Booker Prize and the 2012 Costa Book of the Year. The final novel in the trilogy, The Mirror and the Light, was published in March 2020. Plot Bring Up the Bodies picks up from Wolf Hall. The King and Cromwell‚Äînow Master Secretary to the Privy Council‚Äîare guests of the Seymours at Wolf Hall. The King brushes with Jane Seymour and begins to fall in love; his marriage to the new queen, Anne Boleyn, is sometimes loving but often full of angry quarrels. 'I cannot live as I have,' Henry tells Cromwell in private. He tires of Anne who brings him neither peace nor heirs and wants his marriage ended; Cromwell vows to make this happen. Ever the dealmaker, Cromwell tries to negotiate an end through Anne's father, Wiltshire, and her brother, Rochford. Wiltshire is willing to negotiate; Rochford is not. Cromwell asks around among those close to Anne; he hears she's been unfaithful to the King. The musician, Mark Smeaton, and Anne's sister-in-law, Lady Rochford, pass rumours. Cromwell begins to build his case. With proof enough to have her held and tried for treason, the King would see Anne destroyed to serve his ends. Mindful that many of those closest to Anne helped ruin his mentor, Cardinal Wolsey, Cromwell relishes the opportunity to bring them down. In the end, Anne and several of her circle, including her brother, are tried and put to death. Cromwell is sure not all the proof was lawful. The King moves to wed Jane Seymour and rewards Cromwell with a barony; his position as Henry's chief adviser seems sound. Publication Bring Up the Bodies was published in May 2012, by Harper Collins in the United Kingdom and by Henry Holt and Co. in the United States, to critical acclaim. Reception Janet Maslin reviewed the novel positively in The New York Times: Adaptations In January 2013, the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) announced it would stage adaptations by Mike Poulton of Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies in its winter season.

This case introduced the principle of fair treatment as an organizing principle in Canadian corporate law. Facts BCE Inc. was the subject of multiple offers involving a leveraged buyout, for which an auction process was held and offers were submitted by three groups. All three offers contemplated the addition of a substantial amount of new debt for which Bell Canada, a whollyowned subsidiary of BCE, would be liable. One of the offers, which involved a consortium of three investors, was determined by BCE's directors to be in the best interests of BCE and BCE's shareholders. That was to be implemented by a plan of arrangement under s. 192 of the Canada Business Corporations Act,CBCA, s. 192 which was approved by 97.93% of BCE's shareholders but opposed by a group of financial and other institutions that held debentures issued by Bell Canada and sought relief under the oppression remedy under s. 241 of the CBCA.CBCA, s. 241 They also alleged that the arrangement was not \\"fair and reasonable\\" and opposed s. 192 approval by the court. Their main complaint was that, upon the completion of the arrangement, the short‚Äëterm trading value of the debentures would decline by an average of 20 percent and could lose investment grade status. Judgment =Superior Court of Quebec= Silcoff J. of the Superior Court of Quebec approved the arrangement as fair and dismissed the claim for oppression. On appeal, the Quebec Court of Appeal held: :* the arrangement had not been shown to be fair and held that it should not have been approved, :* the directors had not only the duty to ensure that the debentureholders' contractual rights would be respected, but also to consider their reasonable expectations, and :* since the requirements of s. 192 of the CBCA were not met, the court found it unnecessary to consider the oppression claim. BCE and Bell Canada appealed the overturning of the trial judge's approval of the plan of arrangement, and the debentureholders cross‚Äëappealed the dismissal of the claims for oppression. =Supreme Court= In a unanimous decision, the SCC ruled that the appeals should be allowed and the cross‚Äëappeals dismissed. In summary, it held that the s. 241 oppression action and the s. 192 requirement for court approval of a change to the corporate structure are different types of proceedings, engaging different inquiries. The Court of Appeal's decision rested on an approach that erroneously combined the substance of the s. 241 oppression remedy with the onus of the s. 192 arrangement approval process, resulting in a conclusion that could not have been sustained under either provision, read on its own terms. ;Remedies under the CBCA The SCC reviewed the various remedies available to shareholders that have developed under the common law, and that have subsequently been expanded upon in the CBCA:BCE Inc., par. 41-46 :* a derivative action under s. 239CBCA, s. 239 :* a civil action against the directors for breach of duty of care :* an oppression action under s. 241 :* contesting a plan of arrangement under s. 192 In the present case, only ss. 192 and 241 were being raised. ;Nature of the oppression remedy In assessing a claim of oppression, a court must answer two questions:BCE Inc., par. 68 :* Does the evidence support the reasonable expectation asserted by the claimant? and :* Does the evidence establish that the reasonable expectation was violated by conduct falling within the terms \\"oppression\\", \\"unfair prejudice\\" or \\"unfair disregard\\" of a relevant interest? Where conflicting interests arise, it falls to the directors of the corporation to resolve them in accordance with their fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the corporation, \\"viewed as a good corporate citizen\\".BCE Inc., par. 66, 81 ;Approval process for a plan of arrangement In seeking court approval of an arrangement, the onus is on the corporation to establish that :* the statutory procedures have been met; :* the application has been put forth in good faith; and :* the arrangement is \\"fair and reasonable\\".BCE Inc., par. 137 To approve a plan of arrangement as fair and reasonable, courts must be satisfied that :(a) the arrangement has a valid business purpose, and :(b) the objections of those whose legal rights are being arranged are being resolved in a fair and balanced way.BCE Inc., par. 138 Courts on a s. 192 application should refrain from substituting their views of the \\"best\\" arrangement, but should not surrender their duty to scrutinize the arrangement. Under s. 192, only security holders whose legal rights stand to be affected by the proposal are envisioned. It is a fact that the corporation is permitted to alter individual rights that places the matter beyond the power of the directors and creates the need for shareholder and court approval. However, in some circumstances, interests that are not strictly legal could be considered. The fact that a group whose legal rights are left intact faces a reduction in the trading value of its securities generally does not, without more, constitute a circumstance where non‚Äëlegal interests should be considered on a s. 192 application.BCE Inc., par. 149-155 In this case, the debentureholders did not constitute an affected class under s. 192, and the trial judge was correct in concluding that they should not be permitted to veto almost 98 percent of the shareholders simply because the trading value of their securities would be affected. It was clear to the judge that the continuance of the corporation required acceptance of an arrangement that would entail increased debt and debt guarantees by Bell Canada. No superior arrangement had been put forward and BCE had been assisted throughout by expert legal and financial advisors. Recognizing that there is no such thing as a perfect arrangement, the trial judge correctly concluded that the arrangement had been shown to be fair and reasonable.BCE Inc., par. 161-164 Significance The judgment expanded on the SCC's previous ruling in Peoples Department Stores Inc. (Trustee of) v. Wise concerning the latitude of discretion accorded to corporate directors, providing they follow certain procedural steps. There has been discussion as to whether these two judgments provide a coherent or complete summary of the law in that area. There has also been extensive debate about the Court's obiter comment on the duties of directors: In addition, BCE Inc. effectively mandates the use of fairness hearings by courts in consideration of plans of arrangements, as was notably practiced during the litigation that took place on the 2010 share buyout by Magna International. =The Principle of Fair Treatment= Canadian corporate law contains an organizing principle of fair treatment within the Supreme Court's notion that directors are to act in the business interests of the corporation, \\"viewed as a good corporate citizen\\". A connection exists between corporate law's principle of fair treatment and contract law's principle of good faith established in Bhasin v. Hrynew ‚Äì the Court's concern for standards of conduct that are both ethical and commercially reasonable. The much higher fiduciary duty has strong conceptual differences from the principle of good faith, yet shares this common underlying policy governing corporate and commercial relationships. =Relationship with the Fiduciary Duty= Where conflicting interests arise, it falls to the directors of the corporation to resolve them in accordance with their fiduciary duty. This is defined as a \\"tripartite fiduciary duty\\", composed of: #an overarching duty to the corporation, which contains #a duty to protect shareholder interests from harm, and #a procedural duty of \\"fair treatment\\" for relevant stakeholder interests. This tripartite structure encapsulates the duty of directors to act in the \\"best interests of the corporation, viewed as a good corporate citizen\\". Following BCE, the Court of Appeal of British Columbia noted that \\"breach of fiduciary duty ... 'may assist in characterizing particular conduct as tending as well to be 'oppressive', 'unfair', or 'prejudicial'\\". More recently, scholarly literature has clarified the connection between the oppression remedy and the fiduciary duty: References Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:Canadian corporate case law Category:2008 in Canadian case law ","title":"BCE Inc v 1976 Debentureholders"},{"id":"35719993","text":"Ice skating is popular in North India in places like Ladakh, Kashmir and Shimla where cold weather occurs and it is possible to skate outdoors.

Directed by Jeffrey Hornaday, Teen Beach Movie was filmed in Puerto Rico. It was the only Disney Channel Original Movie to premiere in 2013. A sequel titled Teen Beach 2 premiered on June 26, 2015. Plot Brady and McKenzie (Mack) are surfing near her grandfather's beach hut. Mack then walks in on her grandfather and Brady watching their favorite film, a 1960s musical titled Wet Side Story, where surfers and motorcycle bikers battle for the privilege to hang out at Big Momma's beachside restaurant. Brady learns that Mack promised her aunt after her mother died that she would attend a private school, and she is leaving the next day. Mack asserts that although going is her choice, she feels it is what she has to do, since it is what her mother would want. She tells Brady they will have to break up. Before Mack leaves, she decides to surf a 40-foot wave that is about to hit the beach. Alarmed, Brady gets on a jet ski and goes after Mack. They get swept away and end up on another beach. They soon realize they have been swept inside the Wet Side Story film. Seizing the moment, Brady joins the original cast in singing, to Mack's dismay. Brady relents and informs Mack that there will be a storm and giant wave that should bring them back home at the end of the film. They go into Big Momma's, and introduce themselves to the surfers just before \\"The Rodents Social Club\\" bikers appear and start the surf and turf war. After, Mack and Brady are invited by surfers to come to a party at Big Momma's later that night. Suddenly, their clothing is changed to fit the film and Mack's surfboard appears nearby. That evening during a dance, Mack and Brady are arguing while the film's female lead, Lela (one of the biker girls), is singing on stage. Tanner, the male lead (one of the surfer boys), falls in love with Mack after she bumps into him, and Brady catches Lela when she falls off the stage. This interferes with the film's plot, in which Lela falls into Tanner's arms, not Brady's. They decide to make Tanner and Lela fall in love to fix things. Brady also tells Mack about the villains of the film, Les Camembert and Dr. Fusion, who are going to use a machine to affect the weather to make the surfers and bikers leave so they can control Big Momma's and turn it into a beach resort. Lela and Tanner express their love for Brady and Mack, who subtly suggest to them that there may be someone else they are really meant to be with. That night Mack joins Lela and the other biker girls for a sleepover, while Brady hangs out with Tanner and the surfer boys at Big Momma's. While talking about love, their modern relationship views conflict with the 1960s views. Mack and Brady do not make any progress with Lela and Tanner. The next night, Lela tells Mack that she would like to surf. Mack and Brady realize that they are morphing into the film when Mack falls into water and her hair does not get wet. They then begin singing and are unable to stop. After the song Mack and Brady are captured by Les Camembert and Dr. Fusion and taken to the villains' lighthouse lair. Lela and Tanner fall in love with each other and soon realize that their friends have been kidnapped. They convince the bikers and surfers to team up and save Mack and Brady. Meanwhile, Mack admits that she is glad that she ended up in the film and does not have to attend private school. When Mack says she thinks Lela is braver than her, Brady denies that, saying that Mack is the bravest girl he knows. The surfers and bikers free Mack and Brady, and destroy the villains' machine. The film's plot returns to normal, and Mack and Brady realize they are able to return home. After saying goodbye to everyone, Mack and Brady get on the surfboard and ride a wave, which sends them back to the real world, where no time has passed since they left. The 40-foot wave is still approaching. Mack finally surfs the giant wave successfully. Mack's aunt is upset about her delaying their flight but accepts her decision to spend the rest of the year with Brady. Mack and Brady celebrate by singing a song on the beach. In a post-credits scene, Lela, Tanner, Butchy, Seacat, Giggles and Struts wash up into the real world. A modern day surfer thinks they are lost and allows them to use his cell phone, which they marvel at as they attempt to use it.

Pre-production of the film began in January 2012. Teen Beach Movie was the third Disney Channel Original Movie filmed in Puerto Rico, the first two being Princess Protection Program and Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie. On March 28, 2012, local Puerto Rican press covered part of the filming, which took place on the island. Most beach scenes took place in Fajardo on the east coast of the island, while indoor scenes, such as McKenzie's bedroom, a restaurant, and a kitchen, were filmed inside an undisclosed warehouse in Bayam√≥n. At the time, the film was titled Teen Beach Musical. Mariella P√©rez Serrano, the then-executive director of the Puerto Rico Film Corporation and Carlos An√≠bal V√°zquez, Unit Production Manager, were the main responsible for the local production of this film. \\"The film industry relies heavily on trust and recommendations for the work they do. It is also important to know the professionals working in the field to personally promote Puerto Rico as a destination for filming\\", said P√©rez Serrano. She also said that Disney spent about eight million dollars in Puerto Rico to film this production. \\"We filmed the outdoor scenes in Fajardo\\", revealed V√°zquez. One of Puerto Rico's lead newspapers, Primera Hora, knew, moreover, that the cast of the musical filmed in the beach house of the then-Governor of Puerto Rico, Luis Fortu√±o. The film's soundtrack features ten original songs composed in rhythms of surf rock, Motown R&B;, rockabilly and pop.

It is based on the notion that social media platforms have monopoly power and broad social influence. Background =Definitions = Social media is defined as \\"a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of User Generated Content.\\" Furthermore, the New Zealand Government of Internal Affairs describes it as \\"a set of online technologies, sites, and practices which are used to share opinions, experiences and perspectives. Fundamentally it is about the conversation. In contrast with traditional media, the nature of social media is to be highly interactive.\\" Moreover, the term social media is described as online tools that let people interact and communicate with each other. This has become a standard word for online cultural exchange and a dominant way for individuals to engage on the internet. By using social media individuals become more closely and strongly connected than ever before. The traditional definition of the term public utility is \\"an infrastructural necessity for the general public where the supply conditions are such that the public may not be provided with a reasonable service at reasonable prices because of monopoly in the area.\\" Conventional public utilities include water, natural gas, and electricity. In order to secure the interests of the public, utilities are regulated. Public utilities can also be seen as natural monopolies implying that the highest degree of efficiency is accomplished under one operator in the marketplace. Public utility regulation for social media has been largely criticized because people believe it would produce undesirable and indirect effects. However, others say that truly effective government regulation would produce valuable results. Social media as a public utility is a crucial debate because utilities get regulated, so marking social media websites as utilities would require government regulation of various social media websites and platforms such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter. Applying the term public utility to social media implies that social media websites are public necessities, and, consequently, should be regulated by the government. While social media are not as essential for survival as traditional public utilities such as electricity, water, and natural gas, many people believe it has become vital for living in an interconnected world and without it, living a successful life would be difficult. Therefore, many people believe that social media has reached utility status and should be treated as a public utility. However, others believe that this is not true because social media are constantly revolutionizing and giving such platforms \\"utility status\\" would result in government regulation, which would consequently hinder innovation. Over the past decade many have debated and questioned whether or not \\"Internet service providers should be considered essential facilities or natural monopolies and regulated as public utilities.\\" =Monopoly= A monopoly is defined as \\"a firm that is the only seller of a product or service having no close substitutes.\\" A natural monopoly is when the entire demand within a relevant market can be satisfied at lowest cost by one firm rather than by two or more, and if such a market contains more than one firm then the firms will \\"quickly shake down to one through mergers or failures, or production will continue to consume more resources than necessary.\\" In a monopoly competition is said to be short-lived, and in a natural monopoly it is said to produce inefficient results.\\" Public utility companies can be regulated to prevent them from gaining monopolistic control. In November 2011 AT&T;'s proposal for merging with T-Mobile was rejected because it would have \\"diminished competition,\\" and have led to the company having monopolistic power within the telephone industry. Such regulation is permitted because the telephone industry is a public utility. Similarly, Microsoft has also been prevented from taking various business actions that could result in the company gaining monopolistic power. If social media were a public utility then regulation of Google and Facebook would similarly dictate what they could and could not do. The possibility was raised in 2018 by U.S. Representative Steve King during a House Judiciary hearing on social media filtering practices. Arguments Advocates of this theory believe that social media websites already act like public utilities, and therefore regulation is needed. Additionally, advocates say that in the 21st century, using such websites are as necessary for communication as using traditional public utilities such as telephone, water, electricity, and natural gas are for other everyday uses. Specifically, advocates note that Google search should be treated as a public utility and needs to be regulated because it dominates the search engine market and no website can afford to ignore it. There is the position that a social media website such as Google \\"is a common carrier and should be regulated as such (Newman 2011).\\" These are reinforced by a perception that social media companies fail to properly maintain fair platforms for discourse. =Individual level= On the individual level, advocates of regulating social media as a public utility believe that Internet presence using social media websites is imperative in order to adequately take part in the 21st century as an individual, and consequently, these sites are public utilities and need to be regulated to ensure that constitutional rights of the users are protected. For example, regulation may be needed to protect freedom of speech against risks such as Internet censorship and deplatforming. Social media affects people's behavior. For instance, it plays an important role in shaping its users' decisions and actions pertaining to health. This is demonstrated in a Pew Research Center research, which showed that 72 percent of American adults turned to social media for health information in 2011. Around 70 percent of people with chronic illnesses also use the platform to find cure, diagnoses, and other health answers. This development becomes a public issue as social media are likely to provide wrong medical information. Additionally, social media sites can also facilitate deleterious health behavior such as smoking, drug use, and harmful sexual behavior. =Business level= Advocates of social media as a public utility maintain that social media services dominate the Internet and are mainly owned by three or four companies that have unparalleled power to shape user interaction, and because of this power such businesses need to be regulated as public utilities. Zeynep Tufekci, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, claims that services on the Internet such as Google, eBay, Facebook, Amazon.com, are all natural monopolies. She has stated that these services \\"benefit greatly from network externalities[,] which means that the more people on the service, the more useful it is for everyone,\\" and thus it is difficult to replace the market leader. =Government level= Advocates of social media as a public utility believe that the government should impose restrictions on social media websites, such as Google, that are designed to benefit its rivals. Due to the recent substantial growth of social media websites such as Google, advocates claim that such a website \\"might need search neutrality regulation modeled after net neutrality regulation and that a Federal Search Commission might be needed to enforce such a regime.\\" Danah Boyd expresses a future issue which the government may have to deal with in her research: Facebook is becoming an international social media website, specifically prevalent in Canada and Europe which are \\"two regions that love to regulate their utilities.\\" Furthermore, recent books by New America Foundation Senior Fellow Rebecca MacKinnon and law professor Lori Andrews advise society to start considering Facebook and Google as nation-states or the \\"sovereigns of cyberspace.\\" Overall, advocates of social media as a public utility believe that due to the immense popularity and necessity of social media websites, it is imperative that the Government imposes regulations in the same manner they do for electricity, water, and natural gas. Counterarguments Opponents of this theory say that social media websites should not be treated as public utilities. because these platforms are changing every year, and because they are not essential services for survival as common public utilities are, such as water, natural gas, and electricity. Furthermore, opponents fear that imposing \\"utility\\" status on a social network site, and forcing regulation might lock such a site in as a real monopoly, which consequently, will stop innovation, and counteract competition. Opponents point out that because social media are constantly evolving, innovation and competition are necessary for its growth. =Individual level= On an individual level, opponents state that treating social media websites as regulated public utilities \\"would harm consumer welfare because public utility regulation has traditionally been the archenemy of innovation and competition.\\" The Director of the Public Utility Research Center at University of Florida, Mark Jamison, points out that \\"our economies effectively shut down without traditional public utilities such as electricity, water, and natural gas because utilities occupy unique positions and provide public services (Glaeser 1927)\\" Opponents to social media as a public utility claim that our economy would not shut down without social media websites. Additionally, Mark Jamison brings up a situation in 2009 which illustrates how consumers can easily find alternatives to social media sites such as Google search. \\"For about an hour on the morning of January 31, 2009, Google search results contained a noticeable error. During that period of time a large number of customers switched their search activity to Yahoo! and probably to other search engines (Google 2009; Vascellaro 2009).\\" Such an incident shows that while social media sites are extremely popular, they are \\"not essential to our social and economic functions in the way that electricity and water are.\\" Additionally, opponents maintain that social media websites are relatively new, and that new ones continue to displace the old ones. Individuals are rapidly discovering new alternatives for social media websites. For example, opponents point out that MySpace was the market leader long before Facebook became active, and was expected to have continued success. However, once the platform Facebook was created, users jumped to this new social media website, and within a short period of time MySpace lost the majority of its users, was forced to cut costs, and therefore may disappear in the near future. Opponents say that due to such discoveries, social media are not public utilities because a utility is considered an \\"essential facility\\" that has no good alternatives. =Business level= On a business level, opponents fear that if social media websites become public utilities then providers of these sites will be treated as vital facilities and such a situation \\"threatens to convert predictions of \\"natural monopoly\\" into a self- fulfilling prophecy.\\" Additionally, opponents to social media as a public utility believe that those who advocate regulation of social media websites such as Google \\"fail to give adequate weight to the changes that constantly occur in the search business, the ways that rivals benefit from Google‚Äôs investments, the negative impacts of forcing Google to reveal its search algorithms, and regulation‚Äôs stifling effect on innovation.\\" Additionally, these opponents claim that because such websites and markets are constantly evolving, regulation would consequently be expensive. Specifically, Mark Jamison points out that the regulation of Google would be costly both in terms of the administrative costs and in terms of the delays in innovation that regulation would cause. Opponents to this theory also say that economic regulation of social media sites could decrease investment, and consequently harm customers and rivals. For example, if a social media site such as Google search were regulated, it could \\"result in at least partial public disclosure of Google‚Äôs search algorithms, which would allow other businesses to behave strategically to improve their search rankings without benefitting consumers.\\" Furthermore, social media services are constantly evolving, and consequently, despite the massive user base that sites such as Facebook and Google have, opponents believe that the disappearance of these businesses are \\"only a masterpiece of software away.\\" Traditional businesses classified as public utilities, such as water and electric companies have a monopoly over their services, making these business irreplaceable, and opponents maintain that such is not the case with social media websites. =Government level= Opponents to this theory believe that imposing utility status on social media websites would consequently cause government regulation, which could result in an unfair change for both businesses and individuals. For example suggested by such opponents is the fear that these websites would start to charge a fee in adjustment to the new rules imposed by the government. Mark Jamison points out in his research that government-imposed standards for presenting Google search results would halt innovation, \\"as happened in telecommunications, government oversight was imposed with the intention of protecting telephone companies‚Äô rivals; instead, it delayed technological progress and decreased innovation (Prieger 2002).\\" According to Adam Thierer, George Mason University, \\"social media sites are fundamentally tied up with the production and dissemination of speech and expression, First Amendment values are at stake, warranting heightened constitutional scrutiny of proposals for regulation.\\" Thierer and other opponents to social media as a public utility believe that the providers of social media websites should have the right to decide how their own platforms are configured along with what content is allowed to appear on them, and that the government should not force such restrictions caused by regulation .

Ross Baughman, is an American photojournalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for his portfolio showing the brutal treatment of prisoners by Rhodesian Security Forces in the fall of 1977. Early life and photographic career Baughman was born in Dearborn, Michigan to Charles T. Baughman, an executive for the Ford Motor Company and Patricia Baughman. He attended Marion L. Steele High School in Amherst, Ohio, where he worked on the school newspaper staff and was the salutatorian of his graduating class in 1971. After graduating from Kent State University in 1975, where in his junior year he became editor of the school yearbook, The Chestnut Burr, Baughman started work as a photojournalist for The Lorain Journal of Lorain, Ohio, about 30 miles west of Cleveland (now The Morning Journal). In 1976, while at The Journal, he infiltrated a branch of the American Nazi Party in Cleveland called the United White People's Party, and spent seven months recording both its activities and those of an affiliated group in Chicago called the National Socialist Party of America, headed by Frank Collin. The resulting investigative series \\"Nazis in America\\" was initiated June 4, 1977, with a front page story on the murder of Chicago-area businessman Sydney Cohen by Raymond Lee Schultz, who had ties to the American Nazi Party in the 1960s and then became affiliated with the National States' Rights Party.Koziol, Ronald (June 4, 1977). \\"Cyanide Killer Harassed Jews, Anti-defamation unit charges\\".

The Lorain Journal. February 2, 1978. \\"The Journal has been invited to enter the Pulitzer Prizes competition, the highest award in journalism, by Professor Richard T. Baker of Columbia University, New York, secretary of the Pulitzer Prizes Advisory Board. The Journal is responding to the invitation by entering its widely published series on the \\"Nazis in America\\". The series won a first place award for investigative reporting in the Ohio division of the Associated Press Managing Editors competition. \\"Two years later, he won the first-place award for investigative reporting in the Ohio division of the Associated Press Managing Editors competition.\\" Upon leaving The Journal in 1977, Baughman moved to London and accepted a contract with the Associated Press (AP). From there he was sent to Salisbury, Rhodesia to cover the Rhodesian Bush War.Osborne, Richard (December 23, 1977). \\"J. Ross Baughman: A Unique Journalist\\". The Lorain Journal. \\"After the Nazi series was published ... Ross went to London and was hired by the Associated Press.\\" While in Rhodesia, he obtained permission to accompany the Grey's Scouts, a Rhodesian Security Forces mounted infantry unit established in 1975 to combat nationalist guerrilla forces. During the two weeks he spent with the Scouts he captured photographs of troops brutalizing their prisoners. Much of his film was confiscated by Rhodesian government officials but he successfully hid several rolls and smuggled them out of the country.AP (December 3, 1977). \\"American Photographer Says He Saw Black Civilian Beaten by Rhodesian Soldiers\\". The New York Times. \\"When more senior Rhodesian authorities found out who Mr. Baughman was, he was ordered to return to Salisbury where some of his film was confiscated, although he was able to get some out of the country.\\" Three of the photographs were submitted by AP for the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography, which Baughman won‚Äîat age 23, the youngest professional to win a journalism Pulitzer. \\"At age 23, he became the youngest professional ever to win journalism's most prestigious prize.\\" One of J. Ross Baughman's Pulitzer Prize winning photos. Rhodesian photo debate The release of the photographs on December 2, 1977 created a furore among both Rhodesian government officials and Baughman's fellow journalists, with the government claiming inaccuracies in the written report that accompanied the photos and journalists questioning both the means by which the photos were acquired and their authenticity.Kaufman, Michael T. (December 4, 1977). \\"Rhodesians Question Report of Brutality\\". The New York Times. In order to accompany the Scouts, Baughman had to prove he could ride a horse and was required to carry a weapon and wear an Army uniform, thus making himself indistinguishable from the troops. In addition, he presented himself as sympathetic to the aims of the Rhodesian government and military.Burns, John F. (April 22, 1978). \\"In Rhodesia, Connections and Attitudes are Keys to Covering the War\\". The New York Times. While the AP stood behind the authenticity of the photographs, and Rhodesian government officials never questioned them, AP General Manager Keith Fuller expressed doubts about Baughman's methods of acquiring them. Enough speculation was raised that the photographs were withdrawn from consideration for the Robert Capa Gold Medal Award of the Overseas Press Club after the Club's Annual Awards Committee meeting in February 1978.Carmody, Deirdre (April 22, 1978). \\"Pulitzer Photos from Rhodesia Are Now Subject of Controversy\\". The New York Times. When the same photos won the Pulitzer only weeks later several members of the Overseas Press Club jury apologized for their decision, stating that lack of information about the circumstances under which the photos were taken led them to their conclusion.Chapnick, Howard (June 1979). \\"Behind the Pulitzer Prize Controversy\\". Popular Photography. \\"In retrospect, says John Morris, \\"I feel that Ross Baughmann [sic] was unfairly treated by the Overseas Press Club jury. We simply did not have all the facts, but I'm not sure that excuses us.\\" In September 2010 Baughman donated his Pulitzer Prize certificate, one of the cameras he used in Rhodesia and a number of prints made from the film he shot there to the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History, along with other photos and artifacts collected from his career. Career after the Pulitzer While the debate over the Rhodesian photographs took place in the United States, Baughman continued to work for AP overseas, where he was subsequently sent to the Cairo, Egypt bureau and spent two days in March 1978 photographing a raid on Israeli forces in southern Lebanon conducted by the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist guerilla group.Baughman, J. (March 26, 1978). \\"Behind Lebanon Lines with Palestinians\\". The Ypsilanti Press. Visions photo agency front lobby. Baughman worked for AP until the end of May 1978. In June he and two partners, Mark Greenberg and Stephen Schneider, founded the Visions photo agency as part of Independent Visions International in New York City. Visions specialized in investigative photo features which were mainly published by premier news magazines. While working for Visions, Baughman completed a number of assignments for Newsweek, Life magazine, and other major magazines. He remained with the agency as a senior partner until 1996. \\"In June 1978, he founded Visions, a news agency specializing in investigative photo essays by international photographers whose work was published by TIME, Newsweek and other leading newsmagazines.\\" =Injury in El Salvador= On March 3, 1982, while Baughman and photojournalist James Nachtwey were on assignment in El Salvador covering the Salvadoran Civil War for Newsweek, he tripped a land mine while trying locate guerrilla forces.Klein, Julie (March 6, 1982). \\"Ross Baughman risks his life for a picture\\". The Lorain Journal. The accident resulted in severe injuries to Baughman's left leg and minor injuries to Nachtwey.\\"Covering El Salvador\\". Newsweek. March 15, 1984. \\"Two days later photographers J. Ross Baughman and James Nachtwey, both on assignment for Newsweek, tripped a land mine about half a mile from the town of Cinquera. Baughman's left leg was badly broken by the blast, while Nachtwey suffered significantly less serious wounds.\\" Baughman would later call for changes in the way journalists were assigned to cover such wars, after the death of another photojournalist, John Hoagland. He suggested that editors assign journalists to cover only one side of the conflict at a time, thus eliminating the risks of traveling between enemy lines.Baughman, J. Ross (May/June 1984). \\"John Hoagland and the deadly commute\\". Columbia Journalism Review. \\"To minimize the chances of another journalist getting killed the way Hoagland did, editors will have to invest in specialists who cover only one side at a time.\\" =Leaving the press pool in Grenada= On October 28, 1983, while on assignment for Newsweek during the invasion of Grenada, Baughman left the press pool that had been formed by the U.S. Government as a means of protesting the tight restrictions that had been placed on journalists covering the invasion. He called leaving the pool a \\"matter of civil disobedience\\" and spent three days on the island.Beach, Nancy (July 1984) . \\"Jumping pool: Baughman stays behind on Grenada\\". News Photographer Magazine . On October 29, a spokesman for the Joint Information Bureau announced that Newsweek would no longer be included in the press pool. Editor Maynard Parker, while stating that he felt the press restrictions were \\"totally outrageous and unnecessary\\", also said that Newsweek would curtail further dealings with Baughman on the assignment.\\"Newsweek is Dropped from Grenada Visits\\". The New York Times. October 23, 1983. Nevertheless Baughman's photo of a visit to the island by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John William Vessey Jr. did appear in Newsweek.\\"Reagan's Kind of Hero\\". Photo accompanying article captioned \\"A four-star who knows his foxholes\\". Newsweek. November 14, 1983. =Work for Life magazine= J. Ross Baughman shows the clothing he wore while working on a variety of investigative reports. From 1980 to 1996 while with Visions, Baughman was assigned a number of investigative photo essay projects for Life magazine, including the following: * \\"No Haven for the Last of Cuba's Outcasts\\" (November 1980, with reporter Steve Robinson), which examined the issues surrounding the Marielito boat refugees from Cuba being detained at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. * \\"Saturday Night in El Barrio\\" (May 1982, with reporter David Friend), which focused on the lives of members of the 18th Street Gang in Los Angeles. * \\"The Double Closet\\" (May 1983, with writer Anne Fadiman), about two gay fathers raising their four children in a combined household. * \\"A Haven for AIDS Outcasts\\" (January 1984, self-reported with later writing by Dianna Waggoner), covering the first hospice for terminally ill AIDS patients in San Francisco. * \\"Hunting Parole Violators\\" (July 1984 with reporter Ed Barnes), following undercover detectives in New York City hunt for parole violators in an environment made more dangerous by the 'three strikes' laws. * \\"Disarmers of Terror: The World's Busiest Bomb Squad\\" (December 1984 with reporter David Friend), describing the work of Israeli Defense Forces in Jerusalem in disabling terrorist bombs. =The Washington Times= In 1999, Baughman accepted the position of photo editor at The Washington Times, being promoted to deputy director of photography in June 2000, director of photography in March 2003 and finally senior editor, overseeing television, radio and new media development. Baughman also contributed regularly to the print and online editions as a columnist and literary critic, before leaving in December 2009. During this time, The Washington Times photography staff was a finalist for the Breaking News Photography Pulitzer in 2003 for its coverage of the Washington D.C. Beltway sniper story\\"Also nominated as finalists in this category were ... The Washington Times Photography Staff for its vivid capturing of the events and emotions stirred by the sniper killings in the Washington, D.C., region.\\" and Mary F. Calvert was a Feature Photography finalist in 2007 for her depiction of sub-Saharan African women afflicted with fistula after childbirth. Journalistic ethics work Baughman has lectured extensively on the subject of journalistic ethics and methods, including programs at the Smithsonian Institution, the International Center of Photography, and the Rhode Island School of Design, along with other major American universities such as Columbia University, Dartmouth College, and Rutgers University. In lectures and interviews, he has expressed the belief that it is a journalist's duty to record events with as little disruption or interference in those events as possible, even in circumstances where there is danger to the subject. In 2003 while at The Washington Times, he assisted in revising the National Press Photographers Association Code of Ethics, which was officially adopted by the NPPA Board in July 2004. Teaching Baughman was on the faculty of the photo department at the New School for Social Research and Parson's School of Design in New York City from 1979 to 1997. He was an adjunct professor for the University of Missouri Graduate Program in Journalism in New York City from 1984 to 1986, and also taught at New York University from 1980 to 1982. In addition he was a co-founder and program director for the Focus Photography Symposiums in New York City from 1981 to 1988.Who's Who in America, Marquis Who's Who, 2004.

Other interests From 1989 to 2005, Baughman wrote five non-fiction history books on topics ranging from folk art to the Protestant Reformation and the American colonial era. Until April 2009, he also served as curator of colonial history collections at the Bachmann Publick House, a museum in Easton, Pennsylvania. This same collection of family artifacts is now exhibited at the Woodstock Museum of Shenandoah County, Virginia. In addition, he was one of the earliest proponents and administrators of Y-chromosome genetic testing for genealogical purposes. Books by J. Ross Baughman *Graven Images: a Thematic Portfolio, 1976.

Created between 1886 and 1890The Paintings, Watercolors and Drawings of Paul Cezanne: An Online Catalogue Raisonn√©, it is currently part of the permanent collection in the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Description With muted tones and soft colors, C√©zanne painted a home, accented by the gray-blue mountains in the background, the soft greens of the rolling hills, and the brown tones of the fields. C√©zanne's dynamic style is best observed closely in this painting; the brushstrokes intersect in dynamic way, creating a patchwork. The brushstrokes create lively movement within the hard lines that he creates to border the house and the mountain. Historical information House in Provence comes out of C√©zanne's 'mature style', where he lived in Provence with his family, where C√©zanne lived as a youth. This landscape is set on the South side of Mont Sainte-Victoire, which was a favorite subject of the artist. C√©zanne did not share the same interests with the rest of the impressionists, instead focusing his work on the basic structure of his subjects. Provenance House in Provence was probably bought by the artist Ambroise Vollard. In 1910, it was sold to Henri Bernstein. It was likely sold to Gottlieb Reber in 1918. It was sold to Marie Harriman by 1936. In 1945, the piece was purchased by Caroline Marmon Fesler for the John Herron Art Institute, now the Indianapolis Museum of Art, in memory of her parents, Daniel W. and Elizabeth C. Marmon.

(Anatolia is the Asiatic part of Turkey)  Background  Germiyan Beylik, centered in K√ºtahya, was an important principality formed in Anatolia after the disintegration of Seljuks of Turkey. Initially it controlled most of West Anatolia. But after local governors of Germiyan formed their own beyliks (like Aydƒ±n and Saruhan) Germiyan power was declined. Germiyan beys accepted the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire in order to check the attacks of the Karaman beylik, another beylik to the southeast of Germiyan.  First reign  His father was S√ºleyman of Germiyan. Following his father's death, Yakup was enthroned as the 4th bey of the Germiyan beylik in 1388. The next year however, after learning the death of Ottoman sultan Murat I in the battle of Kosova, Yakup captured some of the former possession of the beylik, given to Ottomans as a marriage portion. However Beyazƒ±t I the new sultan and Yakup's brother in law quickly returned to Anatolia and jailed Yakup in the castle of ƒ∞psala, a castle in the European part of the Ottoman Empire. Years in prison Yakup spent about 10 years in ƒ∞psala castle. In 1399 he escaped to Damascus in Syria, where he met Timur. In the battle of Ankara in 1402, Yakup fought on the side of Timur. The Ottomans were defeated and Timur gave him the former possessions of the beylik.Prof. Ya≈üar Y√ºce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye tarihi Cilt I, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991 pp. 226 Second reign Yakup's second reign coincides with the Ottoman Interregnum, and beginning by 1410, Yakup allied himself with Mehmet √áelebi (future Mehmet I) . At the end of the interregnum in 1413, he restored the suzerainty of the Ottomans. Except for a brief duration following the death of Mehmet I, Ottoman suzerainty continued to the end of Yakup's reign. Yakup had no son, and in 1427 Yakup visited Edirne, the Ottoman capital, to bequeathe the beylik to the Ottoman Empire.

Both show profile views of women in half length, holding a tablet. The c. 1648 date is given based on its stylistic resemblances to the artist's Rokeby Venus. Both works share the evocative, loose and fluid brush strokes generally accepted as influenced by Vel√°zquez's exposure to Titian during his 1629‚Äì30 and 1649‚Äì51 visits to Italy.Di Nepi, 218 Female Figure is noted for its \\"restrained elegance, muted color harmonies, and the evocative poetry of the figure's parted lips and \\"lost\\" profile.\\"\\"Female Figure (Sibyl with Tabula Rasa) \\". Meadows Museum, Dallas. Retrieved 4 May 2012. In medieval Christian tradition, sibyls became prophetesses warning the pagan Romans of the coming of Christ. Sibyls were often, as here, portrayed with tablets (or with open books), although they were usually depicted in late Renaissance and Baroque art in sumptuous robes and head-dress. In contrast, this woman has disheveled hair, with loose strands spilling on her neck and exposed upper back, and is dressed in relatively plain clothing. Against this, it has been argued that she is portrayed in an unusually spontaneous manner for the time, captured as if in the fleeting moment in which she gives her prophecy. Her skin is rendered in pearly white tones,Mayer, August L. \\"An Unpublished Velazquez\\". The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Vol. 49, No. 280, JulY 1926. 32 her lips are parted as if about to speak while her finger rests on the seemingly blank tablet (tabula rasa). Art historian Simona Di Nepi, among others, has noted Vel√°zquez's habit for employing unexceptional looking models to sit for classical subject matter and for rendering their features in a realistic, unidealised manner. A number of art historians have raised doubts as to her identification as a sibyl and instead see the woman as a personification of painting, noting the resemblance to Vel√°zquez's Fable of Arachne. It has been suggested that Vel√°zquez used the same model for both works, although this claim is doubted by others on the basis that Arachne's position means her face is hidden from the viewer. Other arguments against the personification of painting include the omission of either a easel or brush. Other suggestions include Clio, the muse of history, or the painter Flaminia Triunfi, whom Vel√°zquez is known to have met in Italy.Palomino, 209 Gallery File:Sibyl (Portrait of Juana Pacheco).jpgJuana Pacheco, Wife of the Artist, as a Sibyl (?), c. 1631. A more rigid representation of a similar portrait pose. This work was heavily over-painted in the 19th century, when elements such as jewellery were added.

His life is not distinguished for spectacular works but rather for the humble and simple life in which he led his life as well as for his kindness - in particular towards the most deprived persons. He spent most of his life in Granada where its people still remember and celebrate him as a model example of Christian life and virtue. The cause for his canonization commenced in 1982 when he was made a Servant of God and he was later named as Venerable on 15 March 2008. Archbishop Angelo Amato presided over his beatification on 12 September 2010 on the behalf of Pope Benedict XVI. Biography =Early life= Francisco Tom√°s de San Juan Bautista M√°rquez y S√°nchez was born on 24 June 1864, in Alpandeire, Spain, a small village in the province of M√°laga (southern Spain), and was baptized on the following 29 June 1864. His parents, Diego M√°rquez y Ayala and Jer√≥nima S√°nchez y Jim√©nez, were industrious peasants. He was the eldest son out of four children from that marriage (two other boys and one sister). His brothers were called Diego and Juan Miguel, and his sister, Mar√≠a Teresa. M√°rquez decided to embrace religious life in 1894, at the age of 35. His decision came after he witnessed a Capuchin friar preaching in the city of Ronda. He later declared that the secluded way of life of those men had made a good impression on him . He felt attracted by the idea of serving God by becoming similar to them. =Religious life= He decided to devote himself to religious life after hearing two Capuchin friars preach in the city of Ronda, on the occasion of the beatification of the friar, Didacus Joseph of Cadiz, in 1894. Even though he communicated his religious intention to the Capuchin friars in Ronda, it was not until five years later that he became part of the Capuchin Order. After several attempts were unsuccessful, he joined in 1899 as a postulant in the friary of the Capuchin Order in Seville. In 1900 he entered the novitiate and received the religious name of Leopold. After successive assignments to Antequera, Granada and Seville again, on 21 February 1914 Leopold was moved permanently to the friary in Granada, where he lived for the next 42 years. Most of the time Leopold served as the quaestor (seeker) of the community, which had him walk around the city and into many homes requesting donations. Gradually he became a familiar sight in the city, so many people sought his advice or intercession, beginning to know him as \\"the humble beggar of the three Hail Marys,\\" because that was the prayer dedicated to those who sought his blessing. Leopold died in Granada on 9 February 1956, and is buried in a crypt of the friary church dedicated to his honor.Vicepostulador de Fray Leopoldo References External links * Vicepostulaci√≥n de Fray Leopoldo (Catholic Association in charge of the promotion of the Blessed Leopoldo canonization process) * Order of Capuchin Friars Minor Category:1864 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Capuchins Category:Beatified Roman Catholic religious brothers Category:Spanish beatified people Category:Franciscan beatified people Category:People from the Province of M√°laga Category:Beatifications by Pope Benedict XVI Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope Benedict XVI ","title":"Leopold of Alpandeire"},{"id":"35720413","text":"Calamovilfa gigantea is a species of grass known by the common name giant sandreed.

The party supports greater individual freedom in economic and social spheres. History On 22 April 2012, the governing coalition of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) and TOP 09 dissolved their coalition with VV due to corruption accusations against the party leadership (especially V√≠t B√°rta), raising the possibility that early elections would be held in June 2012. However, shortly afterwards VV Deputy Karol√≠na Peake led a breakaway faction of herself and seven other VV deputies who replaced VV in the coalition with ODS and TOP 09. The revised coalition controlled 100 seats (ODS=51, TOP09=41, LIDEM=8), and won a subsequent vote of confidence on 27 April 2012 by 105 to 93 votes, with additional support from some independent MPs. The new party was launched as LIDEM on 3 May 2012. In September 2012, the party applied for membership of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR), and was accepted on 9 November 2012.http://www.eldr.eu/en/news/eldr-family-grows-council-welcomes- new-member-parties In December 2012, the Czech Prime Minister Petr Neƒças sacked Karol√≠na Peake as Defence Minister after only eight days in the post. He stated that he had lost confidence in her after she had begun her ministerial appointment by sacking one of the most senior officials in the Defence Ministry. This situation created a coalition crisis, as Peake announced that all LIDEM ministers consequently would withdraw on 10 January 2013, unless a solution could be found. On 8 January, LIDEM's republican council guaranteed no ministers would withdraw and the party would still support the government, as long as they could renegotiate a new improved coalition agreement with TOP 09 and ODS. On 7 August 2013, party leader Peake left the Chamber of Deputies building during a vote of confidence for the Ji≈ô√≠ Rusnok government. The remainder of the LIDEM deputies remained in the building and voted against government. The next day, 8 August 2013, Karol√≠na Peake announced her resignation as LIDEM leader.http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/309972-mam-uz-vseho-po-krk-rika- rezignovane-peake.html LIDEM was renamed to VIZE2014 in March 2014.

The six MPs who were both members of the LIDEM parliamentary group and LIDEM party included: * Lenka Andr√Ωsov√° * Dagmar Navr√°tilov√° * Viktor Paggio * Karol√≠na Peake * Ji≈ô√≠ Rusnok * Jana Such√° At the end of April 2013, Jana Such√° did not renew her membership fees for the following year, but the party announced on 4 August 2013 that despite this, she would stay in the party's parliamentary group in the Chamber of Deputies until the next election. On 4 August 2013, it was also reported that the LIDEM parliamentary group still counted all original eight members, as the three independents (non-party members) committed themselves to vote along with the LIDEM party group in the Chamber of Deputies.

Sheridan, 863 F. Supp. 2d 462 (D. Md. 2012), reversed sub. nom., Woollard v Gallagher, 712 F.3d 865 (4th Cir. 2013), was a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of Raymond Woollard, a resident of the State of Maryland, by the Second Amendment Foundation against Terrence Sheridan, Secretary of the Maryland State Police, and members of the Maryland Handgun Permit Review Board. Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants' refusal to grant a concealed carry permit renewal to Mr. Woollard on the basis that he \\"...ha[d] not demonstrated a good and substantial reason to wear, carry or transport a handgun as a reasonable precaution against apprehended danger in the State of Maryland\\" was a violation of Mr. Woollard's rights under the Second and Fourteenth Amendments, and therefore unconstitutional.Woollard v. Sheridan, The trial court found in favor of Mr. Woollard,CBS 13 Baltimore - Md. Gun Law Found Unconstitutional However, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review that decision. The case is notable as being the first direct challenge to a \\"may-issue\\" concealed carry firearms law in the United States, and also for being uncommon among challenges to U.S. firearms law in that the plaintiffs were successful in federal District Court, rather than requiring appeal to a Circuit Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court before a decision was handed down in the plaintiffs' favor. Background The State of Maryland currently prohibits the carry of firearms, be it concealed or open, without a permit issued to the person by the State. These permits are currently issued on a discretionary basis, beyond the federal prohibitions on for example former mental patients and domestic abusers owning lethal guns, (so-called \\"may-issue\\" licensing), based upon, in part, a finding that the applicant \\"has good and substantial reason to wear, carry, or transport a handgun, such as a finding that the permit is necessary as a reasonable precaution against apprehended danger.\\" In 2002, Raymond Woollard was the victim of a home invasion in Baltimore County by his son-in-law, Kris Lee Abbot. Subsequent to this crime, he applied for and was granted a concealed carry permit in 2003, and a renewal was granted in 2006 after Abbot, having violated his probation from the home invasion, was released from prison. However, in 2009, a second renewal application by Woollard was denied on the grounds that Woollard had failed to provide evidence of a continuing threat to his safety. Woollard appealed to the Maryland Handgun Permit Review Board, and was again denied; the Board stating that Woollard \\"...ha[d] not submitted any documentation to verify threats occurring beyond his residence, where he can already legally carry a handgun.\\" The suit was filed on June 29, 2010 in United States District Court for the District of Maryland, contesting that \\"Maryland's handgun permitting scheme is facially violative of both the Second Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\" The Plaintiffs sought relief in the form of the removal of the \\"good and substantial reason\\" requirement of Maryland's firearm laws. As the facts of the case were not in dispute, both parties petitioned the Court for summary judgment on their behalf. Alan Gura, who successfully argued District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago before the U.S. Supreme Court, argued the case pro hac vice for the plaintiffs. District Court Decision In an opinion dated March 2, 2012, District Judge Benson Legg granted summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs. The Court declined to consider Plaintiffs' arguments based on the Equal Protection Clause, instead deciding based on the arguments of the Second Amendment violations. The decision refers to District of Columbia v. Heller, and to relevant post-Heller lower court decisions such as U.S. v. Chester (628 F.3d 673, 4th Cir. 2010) and U.S. v Masciandaro (638 F.3d 459, 4th Cir. 2010) and found that application of intermediate scrutiny is called for; \\"In order to prevail, the State must demonstrate that the challenged regulation is reasonably adapted to a substantial governmental interest.\\" The Court found that, under this standard, the Maryland law requiring \\"good and substantial reason\\" was overly broad; it did not specifically prohibit persons such as convicted criminals or the mentally ill, or even individuals \\"whose conduct indicates that he or she is potentially a danger to the public if entrusted with a handgun\\", as is found in the laws of other \\"may-issue\\" states. The law is instead, as the Defendants admitted to in oral arguments, a rationing system intended solely to reduce the number of firearms carried, by restricting the \\"privilege\\" based on a demonstrated need beyond a general desire for self-defense. The Court found that while the Defendants articulated many compelling reasons why limiting firearms is in the interest of public safety, the \\"good reason\\" requirement did little to combat any of the situations offered; an applicant who has \\"good reason\\" to carry a firearm may still have it forcibly removed or stolen from their person, may still cause a negligent discharge or other accidental injury, and may still use the gun in a criminal manner. In fact, Maryland's law, the decision states, \\"places firearms in the hands of those most likely to use them in a violent situation by limiting the issuance of permits to 'groups of individuals who are at greater risk than others of being the victims of crime.'\\" Summary judgment was entered in favor of the Plaintiffs; however, a temporary stay was granted by the trial court, and Judge Legg heard oral arguments on May 23 to determine if that stay will be continued while the State appeals the decision to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. On July 23, 2012 Judge Legg issued an order dissolving the temporary stay on his previous injunction, effective 14 days after the issuance of said order. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals The appeal was filed by the defendants in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on April 6, 2012, as Woollard v Gallagher (12-1437). Denis Gallagher is a member of the Maryland Handgun Permit Review Board and was a co-defendant at the District level. Terrence Sheridan remains a co-defendant/appellant. On August 2, 2012 the Fourth Circuit granted Maryland's motion for a stay pending the outcome of this appeal. This overruled the District Court's order that would have lifted the stay effective August 7. Oral arguments in the case were heard on October 24, 2012 beginning at 9:30 before Panel 1 of the Court. During the hearing, questions were posed to both lawyers from the bench about the appropriateness of Woollard filing suit in Federal court challenging a ruling by a state agency, an action subject to the application of the Younger abstention and Rooker-Feldman doctrines. Questions were also posed as to the curiousness of Maryland's statute only prohibiting handguns and not long guns; Appellants asserted that the permitting law was put in place in response to a problem with handgun violence; that handguns were overwhelmingly the weapon of choice for criminals and the law was enacted to control this problem. On March 21, 2013 the Fourth Circuit unanimously reversed the District Court opinion. The Circuit Court found that the trial court's judgment hinged on a finding that the rights of the Second Amendment extend outside one's own home, and that the right is \\"impermissibly burdened\\" by the \\"good and substantial cause\\" requirement. The Court found that, while the \\"good cause\\" requirement does indeed infringe upon Woollard's Second Amendment rights, the requirement nevertheless passes intermediate scrutiny (the standard previously determined applicable in Masciandaro and Chester, heard by the same Circuit), by holding that Maryland's desire to reduce handgun violence is a \\"substantial government interest\\", and that the \\"good cause\\" requirement is \\"reasonably fitted\\" to this interest in several ways, primarily by reducing the number of guns on the street, which the Court agreed with the Appellants provides several secondary effects that significantly reduce handgun violence and increase the ability of the police to distinguish criminals from law-abiding citizens. En banc appeal to the full Circuit Court was denied. United States Supreme Court The Second Amendment Foundation filed a Writ of Certiorari with the SCOTUS for this case July 9, 2013. Respondent Gallagher filed a response brief on September 9, 2013. Several amici briefs, all in favor of Petitioner, have been filed. As of September 25, 2013, this case has been scheduled for conference to occur on October 11, 2013. The petition was denied on October 15, 2013.Woollard v Gallagher, .

Available as NASA SP-2001-4521. Unmanned space probes have used this method to collect data on Mars, as opposed to orbiting or landing. A spacecraft designed for a flyby is also known as a \\"flyby bus\\" or \\"flyby spacecraft\\". Concepts One application of a Mars flyby is for a human mission, where after landing and staying on the surface for some time the ascent stage has a space rendezvous with another, unmanned spacecraft, that was launched separately from Earth, flying by. This would mean the ascent stage of the lander to reach the speed necessary equal to that of the spacecraft flying by, but the resources needed for Earth return would not have to enter or leave Mars orbit.Astronautica - FLEM The spacecraft they live in on the journey to Mars does the flyby, but the crew separates and goes into a lander. The Excursion module's ascent stage must rejoin the main spacecraft before it gets too far away. An advantage is that the resources needed for Earth return don't have to enter and leave Mars orbit, but the ascent stage has to perform space rendezvous in solar orbit and the time on Mars is constrained by the need to this. Mars cyclers orbit the Sun in such a way as to pass by Mars and the Earth on regular intervals, performing Mars flybys on regular intervals. The crews would live on the stations during the interplanetary voyages. The concept for Flyby Excursion Landing Module is that a lander and flyby would separate in solar orbit, the lander would accelerate to get to Mars first, then land on Mars meanwhile the other segment does a Mars flyby, then the lander takes off and rendezvous with the flyby segment transferring the crew over.W.I.R.E.D.

During the flyby Mariner 4 took 21 pictures amounting to about 1% of the surface of Mars. Mars was not globally mapped until the Mariner 9 orbiter, which over the course of 1972 to 1973 took thousands of images up to 100m a pixel. Observations from optical ground-based Earth telescopes have to peer through the atmosphere which blurred images, typically limiting them to resolving features about across even when Earth and Mars are closest. THE RED PLANET: A SURVEY OF MARS Slide 2 Earth Telescope View of Mars index In October 1999, Deep Space 1 made observations of Mars after its flyby of asteroid Braille. Although this was a very distant flyby it did succeed in taking multiple infrared spectra with its MICAS instrument of the planet. In 2018, Mars Cube One (MarCO), two flyby CubeSats to relay communication from InSight lander during its EDL were launched towards Mars with the cruise stage.

It aired on Fox in the United States on May 13, 2012.  Plot  Tina shows new girl Tammy around the school, but after the rebellious Tammy eggs her on, Tina shows her a spyhole into the boys locker room, but they get caught and sent to detention. The now- rebellious Tina starts to become upset with her parents, and when they leave her to babysit Gene and Louise while they see Cake (a show presenting patty- cake in the style of Stomp), she invites Tammy, Zeke and Jimmy Jr. to her house and Tammy convinces them to get drunk on margarita mix, until Jimmy Jr. accidentally breaks one of her porcelain toys and Tina tells them to leave. Tammy, however, steals Tina's notebook full of potentially embarrassing \\"erotic friend fiction\\" and blackmails her with it, while Gene and Louise force her to do their chores so they don't reveal the margarita party to their parents. While trying to sneak out with margarita mix for Tammy, Tina gets caught and is grounded, and an upset Tammy warns her that she'll read her friend fiction out at lunch the following day. The next morning, a distraught Tina finally cracks and tells her mom, Linda, everything, and Linda tells her that she's the only person who can make her feel embarrassed and not care what anyone else thinks. This cheers her up, and she decides to write some new friend fiction to read out herself instead. Gene and Louise, having found out about Tammy's blackmailing, steal back the notebook, but Tina still decides to read her story Buttloose (like Footloose but with \\"touching butts\\") only to have the entire cafeteria laugh at her, until Tammy has a sudden bout of flatulence, and the school laugh at her instead, causing her to flee with embarrassment, farting the whole way. Tina, now relieved, thinks that things have turned out OK...until Mr. Frond and Bob begin to patty-cake in front of the school, leading Tina to remark that \\"no one can embarrass you quite like your parents\\". Reception The episode received a 1.8 rating and was watched by a total of 3.69 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating The Cleveland Show, but losing to American Dad!, The Simpsons and Family Guy with 4.94 million. Les Chappell of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, saying \\"All this is well and good, but there‚Äôs a lack of focus to the episode compared to other weeks, which makes me think that centering episodes chiefly on Tina aren‚Äôt the best way for the show to go. Tina‚Äôs such a passive character by definition that her actions usually come as a reaction to her more dynamic family members, and her flashes of independence (such as alter ego Dina in ‚ÄúFood Truckin‚Äô‚Äù) are muted enough to be overshadowed by the characters dragging her on that journey. And in terms of figures driving the action, Tammy‚Äôs relatively tame, her corrupting influence limited to a series of portmanteaus (Prudabaga, Glamsterdam, snorgasm) that confuse Bob and Linda when Tina uses them.\\"  References  External links  Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Bob's Burgers (season 2) episodes ","title":"Bad Tina"},{"id":"35720601","text":"Sabine Steinbach (later Sabine Klemm, born 18 July 1952) is a German former swimmer.

Established in 1878 the Museum has a collection of local geology, biology, archaeological and maritime artifacts. Accompanying the regular exhibitions since 1976 is a collection of images and crafts by local and national artists such as Augustus and Gwen John. Origins At the beginning of January 1878 a meeting of a like-minded group of would be trustees of a proposed museum, was held at 10 The Norton, Tenby, the home of one of their number, Charles Allen. The group also comprises: Edward Laws (Hons. Secretary), Dr Frederick Dyser, Rev. George Huntington, James T. Hawkesley, E. Rawdon Power, Dr. John G. Lock and Frederick Walker. It was the wish of the group to house and display the collection of valuable geological specimens formerly belonging to the late Rev. Gilbert N. Smith, and amateur archaeologist and geologist, who had been the Rector of nearby Gumfreston. The collection had been purchased by the town of Tenby for ¬£100 and was to form the basis of a museum collection together with other promised items of natural history and of scientific books. The trustees wished these collections to be permanently housed in the town for the benefit of the community and from the onset they decided upon a purely local museum with no ‚Äòcosmopolitan‚Äô collections being accepted. (This basic rule has been adhered to ever since and material unconnected with the area is not collected). Having agreed in principle to found a museum, the next important step was to secure a suitable building in which to house the collection. Fortunately, the National school building on Castle Hill had recently been vacated, a new school having been built in the centre of the town. In February 1878, a meeting of the Tenby Town Council, presided over by Alderman Charles Allen, passes a resolution to grant the trustees permission to rent the school building at the cost of one shilling per annum for the purpose of forming a permanent museum. The council had no wish to become involved in any other expenditure and therefore the costs of refurbishing the building and administering a museum were to be met by the trustees. The trustees immediately set about obtaining an estimate for the necessary rebuilding work. Lewis John, a local builder estimated a total cost of ¬£44 12s 11d for initial repair work to the building. His estimate being accepted, Mr John set about repairing the roof, guttering, windows, doorways and staircases together with plastering and some redecoration. His work was regarded as highly satisfactory and he was later employed in further work to the building. Some display cases were also purchased at the time. It was obvious that to provide a community museum, financial help was going to be necessary from within the community itself. Earl in February, Edward Laws, prepared two hundred letters which were circulated to selected residents of the town, setting out the aims of the proposed museum and outlining the finances required to achieve those aims. There was a good response to the letter and soon a number of donations were received. Mr E. J. Reid, the Member of Parliament for the Pembroke Boroughs gave ¬£100 and wrote to Laws: ‚ÄòI need hardly say that the establishment at Tenby of such a museum as that contemplated would be to me, as to many others, a source of great satisfaction‚Äô. There were other similar favourable responses from the community and elsewhere to the idea of forming a museum collection, but, as this extract from a letter to the Tenby Observer of 3 January 1878 written by one ‚ÄòSGP‚Äô of Bristol (subsequently identified as one Samuel Purchase) indicates a note of caution was being urged with regard to the administration of the proposed museum and the safeguarding of its collection.Beynon, J. The origins of Tenby Museum 1878. Tenby Museum History Throughout the last 125 years Tenby Museum and Art Gallery has continued with the support of volunteers, to exhibit, study and preserve a collection relating to the social and cultural history of the area. 17 June 1976 saw the official opening of the Wilfred Harrison Art Gallery. In 1995 the New Art Gallery was opened at Tenby Museum. In the 20th century the museum was affiliated to the National Museum and Galleries of Wales and received increasing recognition and support from a number of professional museum organisations. In the 1990s the museum was the recipient of national awards: the Prince of Wales Award 1993 and the Shoestring Award (Museum of the Year Award 1996) for the UK museum which achieved the most with the least available financial resources. In 2000 national and regional awards were presented for high standards of professional training. On 31 July 2003 Prince Charles visited Tenby and the Tenby Museum and Art Gallery to mark the 125th anniversary of the museum's opening.

In order to help Zheng, Qin attacked and defeated Jin at the Battle of Li (Ê†é, in present-day Yongji, Shanxi). Three years later, during the reign of Duke Dao of Jin, Jin led an alliance of 13 states to attack Qin. The allied army set up camp after crossing the Jing River. Qin poisoned the river from upstream, killing many soldiers of Jin and its allies, who were forced to retreat. This event is known as the Battle of Qianyan (ËøÅÂª∂‰πãÂΩπ).

This position generally advocates smaller and local ownership of media as a way to realize journalistic values and inclusive media public sphere in the society. Background Media ownership concentration is a state that fewer individuals or organizations control many and various media entities. For decades this consolidation of media ownership has been progressive and also controversial in the United States. Recent study shows that many media industries in many areas and countries are highly concentrated and dominated by a very small number of firms. Such media conglomerates own large numbers of companies in various media domains, such as television, radio, publishing, movies, and the Internet. For example, the Walt Disney Company, the largest media conglomerate in the United States in terms of revenue, owns the ABC television network, cable channels (for example, ESPN, Disney Channels Worldwide, and ABC Family), and eight television stations. Moreover, they have radio stations such as ESPN Radio, and publishers like Marvel Comics. One of the most prominent critics on this issue, Robert W. McChesney points out that these media conglomerates can have a strong and harmful impact on media culture. According to him, media giants are most likely to be politically conservative, because they usually take advantage of current social structure, and ‚Äúany upheaval in property or social relations, particularly to the extent that it reduces the power of business, is not in their interest‚Äù. He warns possible lack of views that can oppose current societal structure. Other criticism comes from the aspects of mass media as business activities. U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioner, Michael J. Copps criticize concentrating and highly commercializing media ownership by mentioning that ‚Äúwhen TV and radio stations are not longer required by law to serve their local communities and are owned by huge national corporations, viewers and listeners have become the products that broadcasters sell to advertisers.‚Äù Rationale for the standpoint In 2003, then FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell pushed to relax the FCC's long- standing rules on media concentration, which regulate the market share of cable networks in a market, the number of television stations owned by national networks, and newspaper-TV cross ownership. Powell planned to allow a single company to own up to three television stations, eight radio stations, a local newspaper, a monopolized cable provider and an internet service provider in a single market. He insisted that although FCC had a historic role to protect the diversity of news and information, the recent circumstances surrounding newspaper publishing and television industries forced them to form centralized institutions, for their own survival. C. Edwin Baker, the Nicholas F. Gallicchio Professor of Law and Communication at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, proposes rationale for the standpoint of media owner dispersal, in challenging this FCC's attempts of deregulating media ownership restrictions. =Democratic distributive value= This normative value is based on the egalitarian premise of democracy, the \\"One man, one vote\\" requirement. Baker advocates that this premise should be applied to voice in the public sphere, since voice influences and forms public opinion, more than vote does. In other words, voice can form public opinion and it can also provide the possibility of public deliberation. Consequently, this view leads to discussion that dispersal of media power should be maximized because the media is regarded as the central institution of domestic public sphere. Therefore, according to this value, concentration of media ownership does essentially harm basic principle of democratic society. These are the backbones of the recommendation for a maximization of dispersed media power, which is ultimately represented by the ownership. Regarding this egalitarian \\"equal voice\\" goal, Baker noted three caveats. Not everyone has the same ability or the same desire to engage in public communication The democratic distribution value that maximizes dispersal of media power must not overwhelm the competing value of allowing effective speakers to accumulate large audiences. However, Baker notes, this does not mean that a single man can own multiple media outlets and entities. It only suggests that effective speakers are allowed to appeal to and obtain a great size of audiences. This ‚Äúequal voice‚Äù goal should be understood as individual's guaranteed media experience, where they freely express themselves and see themselves and their views are included in public discourse. Increasing media ownership dispersal requires policy measures Dispersed media ownership contributes to equalizing the distribution of media power. Still, other policy measures will be needed because people who have the similar values, experiences, and perspectives tend to control media entities. Government should take care of these demographic commonalities and try to include different demographic groups in public discourse. Some media usefully aim to embody diverse discourses Similar to the second point above, even legal efforts are also required to assure that different voices are represented in media entities. =Democratic safeguard value= This view argues that wide dispersed media ownership function work as safeguard for democratic society. Baker suggests four examples on how this dispersed media ownership contributes to sound democratic society. Avoid the danger of demagogic power  Media conglomerates influence public opinion and may try to control influence over the public sphere. Dispersed ownership can prevent such abuse of power --- the \\"Berlusconi effect.\\". The existence of the consolidated media power within the public sphere is a real danger. Democratic society cannot accept this risk of power abuse. Many countries have experienced abuse of the concentrated power implicit in conglomerate media ownership. In fact, in past, German media conglomerate allowed and even supported the rise of Hitler. Increase the number of people with power as a watchdog Simply, dispersal media ownership results in putting more people and organizations into being watchdogs of the society. More people and organizations work as a watchdog, broader range of perspectives and more different insights, which can detect possible problems, will be brought to the society. As a result, more malfeasance and incompetence of the powerful can be scrutinized under the dispersed media ownership structure. FCC also explained this aspect of diversified ownership in 1970 as follows: :A proper objective is the maximum diversity of ownership.... We are of the view that 60 different licensees are more desirable than 50, and even that 51 are more desirable than 50.... If a city has 60 frequencies available but they are licensed to only 50 different licensees, the number of sources for ideas is not maximized. It might be the 51st licensee that would become the communication channel for a solution to a severe local social crisis. Reduce the risk of effective external corruption A dispersed media structure increases the number of people who influence over potential corrupters. Alleviate undermining journalistic integrity caused by the conflicts of interest Media concentration worsens the problems of interest conflicts. Journalism is sometimes distorted by such conflicts of interest. In short, journalism is vulnerable to outside pressure. These journalistic distortions tend to occur with other media companies or multi-industry conglomerates for the promotion of other (commercial, financial, or political) interests. For example: *Commercial interests decide news. In November 1999, NBC affiliate stations did not regard ABC's popular quiz show, Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, as newsworthy. In contrast, ABC's affiliates mentioned the show in 80.2% of their local news programs. *When The New York Times began an expos√© series criticizing the pharmaceutical industry, pharmaceutical companies threatened the publisher by implying to withdraw all advertisements from medical magazines that the New York Times owned. The New York Times resisted the threats and continued the expos√© series, but they resulted in selling the medical magazines consequently *When Knight-Ridder's Detroit paper sought Attorney General Ed Meese's approval on a joint operating agreement with another Detroit paper, Knight-Ridder had to stop campaigns against Ed Meese in his another paper, The Miami Herald. *U.S. President Richard Nixon tried to retaliate against The Washington Post by creating troubles in its broadcast license renewal. *NBC, owned by General Electric, clearly has an incentive to support its owner's economic interests, for example, nuclear plant stations. *An oil company, Atlantic Richfield, purchased a British broadsheet, The Observer, during the period when it was seeking North Sea oil leases, which received harsh media criticism. Dispersal of ownership can reduce such conflicts. =Media quality value= Media conglomerates' primary focus is placed on the bottom line, sacrificing quality of journalistic reporting. According to Baker, executives of conglomerate, especially private and publicly traded companies, without stable management structure, such as family or in-group ownership, tend to value profits over journalistic values. It is understandable because these executives in those media giants are most likely to be required to maximize the profit rather than to serve their community by high standard reporting. These executives are rewarded (or fired) on the basis of their ability (or inability) to increase the bottom line. They often take some of identity from their achievements of profit-making. These bottom-line concerns are encouraged by day-to-day interactions, such as business trades, not with the people of a community that they are supposed to serve, but with other stakeholders and other executives who also value higher profits than journalism. Two structural reasons can be suggested to explain why these executives and media owners are not only less inclined, but also less free to make the choice of sacrificing profits for journalism. *An executive of a publicly traded company faces obligations and intense pressure to serve the bottom line. *In merging other companies, whether or not the merger will be successful is only examined by the calculations of the property's potential future profits. This forces media companies to focus on producing profits to pay the debt created by the purchase. Therefore, media conglomerates purchasing other companies tend to emphasize the bottom line, rather than journalistic or cultural values of the property. Contrarily, smaller, local owners who take aspects of identity from their contributions to their community and their journalistic outputs they produce; workers who take professional and journalistic pride in the quality of their reports; non-profit organizations whose goals are to serve their community tend to value journalism over financial profits. Therefore, dispersal of ownership enhances quality of media contents. Criticism Daniel Ho, an Assistant Professor of Law & Robert E. Paradise Faculty Fellow for Excellence in Teaching and Research at Stanford Law School and Kevin Quinn, an Associate Professor in Department of Government and Institute for Quantitative Science at Harvard University, criticize the claim that media consolidation reduces viewpoint diversity. They argue this ‚Äúconvergence hypothesis‚Äù is not empirically proven, but it has been recognized as ‚Äúempirical bedrock‚Äù of FCC's regulation on media concentration. By adopting statistical techniques to previous five merger cases, they discuss that these media mergers, such as the merger of The New York Times and The Boston Globe, did not show any statistical correlation with reduction of viewpoint diversity on the media. Responding to their point, Baker argues back that they mistakenly pay attention to the impacts of mergers on viewpoint diversity. Baker argues that source diversity should be focused instead.

Smith was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast-medium. He was born at Corsham, Wiltshire. Smith made his debut in county cricket for Wiltshire in the 1929 Minor Counties Championship against the Surrey Second XI. From 1929 to 1939, Smith made 89 appearances for Wiltshire in the Minor Counties Championship, the last of which came against Dorset. In his career with Wiltshire he took 387 wickets at an average of 16.84. In 1935, Smith made his first-class debut for a combined Minor Counties team against the touring South Africans at Richmond Drive, Skegness. Batting first, the South Africans made 394 all out, with Smith taking the wickets of Eric Rowan and Dudley Nourse, finishing with figures of 2/97 from 28 overs. Responding in their first-innings, the Minor Counties made 190 all out, during which Smith, who batted at number eleven, ended the innings not out on 7. Forced to follow-on in their second-innings, the Minor Counties made 224 all out, with Smith the last man out when he was dismissed for a single run by Arthur Langton. The South Africans reached their target in their second-innings for the loss of two wickets, with Smith taking both wickets to fall, those of Langton and Robert Williams, with figures of 2/10 from two overs. The following season he made a second and final first-class appearance for the Minor Counties against Oxford University at the University Parks. Batting first, the Minor Counties made 251 all out, with Smith the last man out when he was dismissed for 35 runs by Tristan Ballance. In response, Oxford University made 288 all out in their first-innings, with Smith playing a major part with the ball, taking five wickets to finish with figures of 5/95 from 35 overs. In their second- innings, the Minor Counties made 294 all out, with Smith again the last man out, this time dismissed for 4 runs, with Ballance again taking his wicket. Oxford University reached 23 without loss in their second-innings, with the match declared a draw. He died at Trowbridge, Wiltshire, on 6 January 1990. His younger brother, Jim, played Test cricket for England.

The club was established in 1871, making it one of the oldest professional teams in England. Reading joined the Football League in 1920. The Royals competed at the top flight of English football for the first time in the 2006‚Äì07 season. Early years (1871‚Äì1941) Reading Football Club was formed on 25 December 1871 by founder Joseph Edward Sydenham.Discover gems of our heritage , Reading Chronicle, 10 September 2009. They were originally nicknamed The Biscuitmen after one of the main trades in the town, Huntley & Palmers biscuits, but changed to the Royals in the 1970s, when the company closed their factory. This history is reflected in the name of the club's unofficial fanzine, Hob Nob Anyone?, named after a popular British biscuit. The switch to professionalism in 1895 resulted in the need for a bigger ground and, to this end, the club moved again, to the purpose-built Elm Park on 5 September 1896. Supporters at a Reading match at Elm Park in 1913 In 1913, Reading toured Italy and beat Genoa 4‚Äì2 and A.C. Milan 5‚Äì0, narrowly lost 2‚Äì1 to Casale, before beating Italian champions Pro Vercelli 6‚Äì0 and the full Italian national team 2‚Äì0, prompting the leading sports newspaper Corriere della Sera to write \\"without doubt, Reading FC are the finest foreign team seen in Italy.\\" Reading were invited back for another tour the following year, but there is no evidence it took place. It is possible it was cancelled due to the imminence of World War I, which claimed the lives of many Reading F.C. players, including Alan Foster, who put a hat-trick past Milan. Other players lost included amateurs Charles West and Heber Slatter. Attilio Fresia moved to Reading as a result of the tour, becoming the first Italian to play in English football. Reading were elected to the Third Division of the Football League in 1920, as the league absorbed the first division club of the Southern Football League. The club have spent the majority of the time since then in the third and fourth tiers of the league, with occasional flirtations with the second tier. Reading's best performance in the FA Cup came in 1926‚Äì27 when they lost to eventual winners Cardiff City at Molineux in Wolverhampton in the semi- final. The attendance at the 1‚Äì0 victory over Brentford in the fifth round set a new attendance record for Elm Park, at 33,042 people. This remains the highest attendance at a Reading home match. Reading were promoted to the Second Division, following a Third Division South title win in 1926; the Royals were relegated back to the third tier in May 1931. The club defeated Bristol City to win the Southern Section Cup in 1938, and won the London War Cup in 1941 by defeating Brentford 3‚Äì2 in the final at Stamford Bridge. Post-war years (1945‚Äì1990) Reading playing at Elm Park in 1981 The club remained in Division Three after the war, but finished in second place in their division in 1948‚Äì49 and 1951‚Äì52. Their 10‚Äì2 win over Crystal Palace in September 1946 remains the club's scoring record. Reading were relegated to the fourth tier of English football for the first time in the 1971‚Äì72 season. A return to the Third Division was achieved, following a third-placed finish in 1975‚Äì76, but the club suffered immediate relegation. The 1978‚Äì79 season saw Reading win the Fourth Division to win promotion back to the Third Division. Relegation was suffered in 1982‚Äì83. Towards the end of that season, Oxford United chairman Robert Maxwell announced that he had completed a deal to merge Oxford and Reading into a single club ‚Äì Thames Valley Royals. Maxwell claimed that both clubs were on the verge of bankruptcy and having a united team was required for the Thames Valley region to retain a Football League club. The proposed amalgamation was prevented by the actions of Roy Tranter, a Reading director, and Roger Smee, a former Reading player. Smee disputed the legitimacy of the controlling interest in Reading held by the three board members that supported the merger plan. Tranter launched a legal challenge to the sale of certain shares on 22 April 1983. The supporters of the plan allies resigned under pressure from the rest of the Reading board in May 1983. At an extraordinary shareholders' meeting in July, Smee took over the club to end the amalgamation plans. Following the collapse of the merger plan, Reading were promoted back to the Third Division at the end of the 1983‚Äì84 season. This remains the last time the football club has competed at this level of English football. Reading won the league in the 1985‚Äì86 season under the management of Ian Branfoot, following a run of thirteen successive wins at the start of the season, earning promotion to the Second Division. This was the first time in fifty-five years that the club had played at this level. The club reached their first major cup final in the 1987‚Äì88 season, when they won the Simod Cup. They beat four top flight sides en route to the final. The club's first Wembley appearance saw the club victorious over First Division Luton Town, with a 4‚Äì1 victory. Later in the season, the club were relegated back to the third tier. Branfoot left his job as manager in October 1989, having failed to get the Royals back into the Second Division. His successor, Ian Porterfield, lasted just 18 months before further failures cost him his job. New era (1990‚Äì1998) The appointment of Mark McGhee as player-manager, shortly after the takeover by John Madejski, in June 1991 saw Reading move forward. They were crowned champions of the new Division Two in 1994, seeing the club promoted to the second tier. When McGhee moved to Leicester City halfway through the following season, Reading were in contention for a second successive promotion. 35-year-old striker Jimmy Quinn was put in charge of the first team alongside midfielder Mick Gooding and guided Reading to runners-up in the final Division One table ‚Äì only to be denied automatic promotion because of the streamlining of the Premier League, from twenty-two teams to twenty. Reading had eased past Tranmere Rovers in the play-off semi-finals and looked to have booked their place in the Premier League after building up a 2‚Äì0 lead over Bolton Wanderers by half time in the play-off final. Two late goals from Bolton forced extra time and the match ended 4‚Äì3 to Bolton. Quinn and Gooding's contracts were not renewed two years later after Reading had slid into the bottom half of Division One. The last ever competitive match played at Elm Park between Reading and Norwich City in May 1998 Their successor, Terry Bullivant, lasted less than one season before being sacked in March 1998. The Royals finished that season bottom of Division One, slipping back into Division Two in their final season at Elm Park. Onwards and upwards (1998‚Äì2008) Reading moved into the new 24,200 all-seater Madejski Stadium, named after chairman John Madejski, in August 1998. The club won their first match at the ground, beating Luton Town 3‚Äì0. Tommy Burns had taken over from Terry Bullivant but lasted just 18 months before being sacked in September 1999, after a poor start to the season after the club's failure to win promotion the previous season. He was replaced by former reserve team manager Alan Pardew. Pardew guided Reading to a third-place finish in the 2000‚Äì01 season, where the club were beaten in the play-off final by Walsall 3‚Äì2 after extra time. Later on in 2001, Reading became the first football club to register their fans as an official member of their squad, giving the \\"player\\" registered with squad number 13 as 'Reading Fans'. Reading returned to Division One for the 2002‚Äì03 season after finishing runners-up in Division Two. A final day draw away at promotion rivals Brentford saw the club promoted. The following season they finished fourth in Division One and qualified for the play-offs, where they lost in the semi-final to eventual winners Wolverhampton Wanderers. Pardew acrimoniously moved to West Ham United the following October and being replaced by Brighton & Hove Albion manager Steve Coppell. Coppell took the Royals to seventh in his first full season with the club, missing out on a place in the play-offs by three points. Fans celebrate their team winning the 2005‚Äì06 Football League Championship Reading won the 2005‚Äì06 Championship with a league record 106 points, scoring 99 goals and losing only twice in league. Promotion to the Premiership was assured on 25 March 2006, with a 1‚Äì1 draw away at Leicester City. The following Saturday, the club secured the title with a 5‚Äì0 thumping of Derby County. The 2006‚Äì07 season saw Reading make their first appearance in the top flight of English football. Striker Dave Kitson became the first player to score for Reading in the top flight, as the Royals came from 2‚Äì0 to beat Middlesbrough 3‚Äì2 in their first game in the Premiership. The Royals defied pre-season predictions of relegation to finish the season in eighth place with 55 points, missing out on UEFA Cup football by a single point; Reading turned down the chance to play in the UEFA Intertoto Cup. In the run up to their second season in the Premier League, Reading were invited to take part in the 2007 Peace Cup in South Korea, playing Argentine giants River Plate, French champions Lyon and Japanese side Shimizu S-Pulse. The Royals failed to qualify for the final on goal difference. This second season was less successful and Reading were relegated back to the Championship following a loss of form in the second half of the season. Despite winning 4‚Äì0 away at fellow strugglers Derby County on the last day of the season, Fulham's 1‚Äì0 at Portsmouth was enough to see the club fall out of the top flight.http://www.readingfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10306~1310731,00.html Recent seasons (2008‚Äìpresent) Reading started the 2008‚Äì09 season with a 15 match unbeaten home run until losing to Southampton. In the second half of the season, they struggled to regain the form and slipped down the table before recovering to finish fourth and qualify for the play-offs, where they lost to Burnley in the semi-final. Manager Steve Coppell resigned just hours after the game, being replaced by former academy manager Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers left the club by mutual consent on 16 December 2009, following a poor start to the season which saw the Royals in a relegation battle. Brian McDermott was made caretaker manager the same day. He was given the job on a full-time basis, following a surprise 2‚Äì1 extra time win over Liverpool at Anfield in the FA Cup. Reading reached the quarter-finals of the competition for the first time since the 1927 cup-run, losing 4‚Äì2 to Aston Villa at the Madejski Stadium. In the following season, Reading beat West Bromwich Albion, Stevenage and Everton to reach the quarter-final of the competition for the second successive season, where they lost 1‚Äì0 to Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium. In the league, Reading finished fifth in the Championship to qualify for the division's play-offs. After beating Cardiff City in the semi-finals they lost 4‚Äì2 to Swansea City in the final at Wembley Stadium. Reading started the 2011‚Äì12 season by selling captain Matt Mills and player of the season Shane Long. Early results were not favourable and the club sat second-bottom of the table after six games. However, a streak of good form in the second half of the season, combined with the signings of Adam Le Fondre, Kaspars Gork≈°s and Jason Roberts, ensured promotion to the Premier League on 17 April 2012 with 1‚Äì0 home win against Nottingham Forest. In their next match on 21 April 2012, Reading secured the Championship title with a game to spare after 2‚Äì2 draw with Crystal Palace when second-placed Southampton failed to beat Middlesbrough, losing 2‚Äì1. On 21 January 2012, it was announced that John Madejski planned to sell 51% of the club to Thames Sport Investments led by Russian-born Anton Zingarevich which was eventually completed on 29 May 2012. On 30 October 2012, Reading created an unwanted record in the last 16 of the League Cup. At home to Arsenal, they took a 4‚Äì0 lead after 37 minutes, but Arsenal drew level at 4‚Äì4 in stoppage time to take the match into extra time, where Reading lost 7‚Äì5. Reading became the first club in the League or FA Cup to have scored five goals in a match and to have still lost. At the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season, Reading were relegated back to the Championship following a 0‚Äì0 draw with relegation rivals Queens Park Rangers. On 17 March 2015, Reading beat Bradford City 3‚Äì0 at the Madjeski Stadium in an FA Cup quarter-final replay to advance to the semi-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 1927. The Royals were defeated by Premier League Arsenal 2‚Äì1, after extra time, to end the club's run in the competition. The club reached the quarter- finals in the next season, losing to Crystal Palace after two late goals by the Premier League outfit. In the 2016‚Äì17, Reading reached the play-offs, following a third place league finish, under new manager Jaap Stam. The Royals narrowly beat Fulham 2-1 on aggregate in the semi-finals to advance to the final. Following a 0‚Äì0 draw at Wembley on 29 May 2017, Huddersfield Town defeated Reading 4‚Äì3 on penalties to deny the club a return to the Premier League.

Excavations near Mound 34 from 2002‚Äì2010 revealed the remains of a copper workshop, although the one of a kind discovery had been previously found in the late 1950s by archaeologist Gregory Perino, but lost for 60 years. It is so far the only remains of a copper workshop found at a Mississippian culture archaeological site. Construction sequence The Ramey Plaza lies to the east of Monk's Mound, at the top edge of the illustration. From the Emergent Mississippian period (beginning approximately 800 CE) to the Stirling Phase (1000 to 1200 CE) the location was a village site with multiple houses, pit features, extensive midden deposits, a copper worskop, and a large structure (possibly as large as by ) with a centrally located hearth. Early in the Moorehead Phase (1200 - 1275 CE) the entire area east of Cahokia saw an intensive construction episode. The village area and all of its structures was razed and the \\"Ramey Plaza\\" and its associated mounds was built over it. This plaza and its twenty associated mounds are the second largest such grouping at the Cahokia site, after the Grand Plaza area which includes Monks Mound and is encircled by the palisade. Mound 34 lies at the northern end of a string of mounds that define the western edge of the Ramey plaza. This construction required the leveling of the area and the removal of much of the village midden that had accumulated over the previous two centuries of occupation, pp to in some areas. This removed midden material, along with nearby earth from borrow pits, was used to build the mounds. Mound 34 was constructed as a low rectilinear platform mound oriented along a north/south axis maintained by the majority of the Cahokia site, and with a terrace or apron along its west, north, and east sides. The mound had a building constructed on its summit, inside of which was a large circular hearth. The mound displayed signs of at least one further building episode during the Sand Prairie Phase (1275 - 1350 CE), when an additional cap of earth was added over the mound. S.E.C.C. connections and avian ceremonialism Engraved shell cup with avian imagery, from Spiro Mounds Artifacts found during excavations of the site included Mississippian culture pottery, beads made from shell, worked copper fragments and raw nuggets, close to 100 distinctive Cahokian style serrated flint arrowheads, and at least one perforated sharks tooth used as a necklace. Several caches of whelk shell cups along with numerous engraved shell fragments were found in excavations of the mound. One cache of six whelk cups and a local mussel shell is considered to be a dedicatory offering deposited upon the beginning of mound construction. Motifs found on the engraved shell and pottery sherds have been connected to the Braden style of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, and are considered the earliest known examples of some of the hallmarks of this style. Faunal remains show that the location had been used for feasting activities through much of its history, even before the construction of the mound. Large amounts of avian remains, many the only examples of particular species found in all of Cahokia, show that the site was connected to avian imagery. Many examples of bird wing bones and other body parts found at the site are considered to have been used for decorative purposes instead of food. Raptor imagery in the form of falcon dancers, the Forked Eye Surround Motif and the \\"Birdman\\" is integrally associated with warrior imagery, a major theme of the S.E.C.C. Engraved shell gorgets and cups with similar imagery were discovered in the \\"Great Mortuary\\" at Spiro in the early 1930s. Radiocarbon dating of Mound 34 has shown that the S.E.C.C. material from the mound was deposited earlier than materials from Spiro and places the origin of the Braden style at the Cahokia site. Other examples of avian related ceremonialism at the overall Cahokia site include two engraved stone tables with birdmen on them and the elite burial found under Mound 72. This burial was of a tall man in his early 40s laid out on an elevated platform covered with a bed of over 20,000 shell beads in the shape of a falcon. Copper workshop Avian themed Mississippian culture repouss√© copper plates The general area of the copper workshop was first discovered by Perino in the late 1950s and definitively located by modern excavations in the 2000s. Located just to the north of the mound, it consisted of a typical Mississippian wall trench structure measuring along its north/south axis and along its east/west axis. The structure had an internal surface area measuring roughly and sunk into the ground. The walls of the building had unusual gaps, now thought by archaeologists to be vents for air flow into the building or to let toxic gases from the heating of copper escape. A variety of raw copper nuggets, small pieces of worked copper, and stone tools for the working of copper were found in the structure, and it is now believed by researchers that the building was used for the processing of raw copper into finished products. The remains of three tree stumps were also found and are thought to have been used to hold anvil stones. Analysis of copper found during excavations showed that it had been annealed, a technique involving repeatedly heating and cooling the metal as it is worked, such as blacksmiths do with iron. Items produced at this workshop may have been similar to copper objects found at other Mississippian sites, such as long- nosed god maskettes, ceremonial earrings with a symbolic shape, thought to have been used in fictive kinship rituals. Many of the stylistically related Mississippian copper plates such as the Wulfing cache from southeastern Missouri, some of the Etowah plates from Georgia, and many of the Spiro plates from Oklahoma are associated with the Greater Braden Style and are thought to have been made in Cahokia in the 13th century. Excavations Although noted on early maps of the Cahokia site and tested by Warren K. Moorehead in 1921 and 1922, the mound was not excavated until 1950 by James B. Griffin and Albert Spaulding. Their small excavations produced large amounts of pottery shards, the remains of the first engraved shell cup found at Cahokia, and fragments of repouss√©d copper plates. In 1956 the mound underwent further excavations by Gregory Perino, funded by the Gilcrease Museum. He uncovered numerous shell fragments and a bed of charcoal he thought was for \\"ceremonial fires\\". He also found an area littered with copper fragments, several copper stained posts and described the area as turning green upon exposure to the air. He described the feature as a possible copper workshop. In the late 1990s archaeologists began examining Perinos field notes and artifacts collected from Mound 34 in order to further refine the Mississippian Art and Ceremonial Complex, define its connection to Cahokia, and find the theorized copper workshop. The site of the mound was relocated (poor mapping by past archaeologists and agricultural flattening had made the exact location tenuous), and an extensive series of excavations were begun at the site from 1998 to 2012. Excavations in 1999 discovered several raw copper nuggets and more pieces of worked copper, confirming the location as a copper workshop, the first confirmed find of this sort at any Mississippian site.

Early in the site's history, the location began as a circle of 48 large wooden posts known as a \\"woodhenge\\". The woodhenge was later dismantled and a series of mortuary houses, platform mounds, mass burials and eventually the ridgetop mound erected in its place. The mound was the location of the \\"beaded burial\\", an elaborate burial of an elite personage thought to have been one of the rulers of Cahokia, accompanied by the graves of several hundred retainers and sacrificial victims. Mound 72 Woodhenge Solstice and equinox sunrise and sunset markers at the Md 72 Woodhenge Early in the history of Cahokia the portion of the site containing Mounds 72 and 96 was the location of a \\"woodhenge\\", a ceremonial area with a in diameter circle of 48 upright wooden posts. Archaeologists date the placement of at least one of the posts to approximately 950 CE. Archaeological research has shown that four of the posts were at the cardinal locations of north, south, east and west, the eastern and western posts marking the position of the equinox sunrise and sunsets. Four other posts in the circle were shown to be at the summer solstice sunrise and sunset and the winter solstice sunrise and sunset positions. This setup is nearly identical to the diameter and post positions of Woodhenge III, one of five successive woodhenges built in another location at Cahokia, differing only in that Woodhenge III was smaller in diameter. Considering the size of the circle and the fact that the post holes themselves could be as much as in diameter, this discrepancy is almost negligible. The placement of the two mounds at the location and the directions in which they are oriented correspond to several of the solstice marking posts. The post nearest the later elite burial of the \\"Birdman\\" is the location that marked the summer solstice sunrise at the times of the site's use. The early stages of the mounds were actually constructed around the posts, although at a later point the posts were removed. Besides their celestial marking functions, the woodhenges also carried religious and ritual meaning that is reflected in their stylized depiction as a Cross in Circle Motif on ceremonial beakers connected with black drink ceremonialism. One prominent example has markers added to the winter sunrise and sunset positions. Mound 72 is a ridgetop mound, one of only six recorded at the Cahokia site. Unlike the other ridgetop mounds which are aligned east/west and north/south (as are most other features at the large site), Mound 72 is aligned 30 degrees off the east/west line. This alignment is the same as the summer solstice sunrise/winter solstice sunset line for this latitude. Near the end of the late Emergent Mississippian Edelhardt Phase or the beginning of the early Mississippian Lohmann Phase (1000-1050 CE) two small platform mounds were constructed around several of the woodhenge posts, one of them the position marking the summer solstice sunrise position. These mounds were expanded and eventually merged and covered over, being reshaped in the process into the final Mound 72 ridge-top mound. =Mound 72sub1= Birdman burial Birdman burial in the site's interpretative center The beginnings of the mounds were the interment of several elite personages oriented to the summer solstice sunrise post. This post is aligned with the north/south axis with a point on the southwest corner of Monks Mound. The post had been replaced several times, including at least one episode after the beginning of mound construction. west of the post was the burial of a tall man in his 40s, now thought to have been an important early Cahokian ruler. The body was placed with his feet to the northwest on an elevated platform covered by a bed of more than 20,000 marine-shell disc beads arranged in the shape of a falcon, with the bird's head appearing beneath and beside the man's head, and its wings and tail beneath his arms and legs. This burial is now known as the \\"Beaded burial\\" or the \\"Birdman burial\\". Below the birdman was another man, buried facing downward. The birdman was buried with several other retainers and elaborate grave goods, including mica and other exotic minerals, copper sheathes thought to be the remains of copper covered chunkey sticks, a cache of chunkey stones and hundreds of finely made arrowheads collected from throughout the Mississippian world, specifically caches from Tennessee, southern Illinois, Wisconsin and a batch from the faraway Caddoan Mississippian peoples in Oklahoma. The arrowheads strongly indicated that Cahokia had extensive trade links in North America. The falcon warrior or \\"birdman\\" is a common motif in Mississippian culture, and is even represented by other finds at Cahokia in the form of 2 small stone tablets with avian-human imagery. This burial clearly had powerful iconographic significance to the peoples of Cahokia. After the burial the location was covered over with Mound 72sub1, a small platform mound oriented in an east/west axis with a ramp projecting to the east and another projecting west toward the summer solstice sunset post. The summer sunrise post was located in the center of the eastern side of the mound. =Mound 72sub2 and 72sub3= This mound was constructed precisely over the remains of a dismantled charnel house that was thought to have been erected at roughly the same time as the woodhenge post which it is next to. Interred in the mound were 2 recently deceased men and several bundled burials, probably the previous residents of the charnel house who had waited for the elite personages to die in order to be interred with them. Over this first phase a square platform with two levels and ramp on its eastern side was constructed. The next episode of construction at this location involved a pit being dug into the mound and a cache of various grave goods being deposited in it. A large rectangular pit was dug into the southeast corner of the mound and a mass burial of 24 women was made in it. A new layer of fill was added to the mound and it was extended to the southeast toward Mound 72sub1, for a ramp or extension over the mass burial. Mound 72 mass sacrifice of 53 young women The next episode of construction involved three stages. A small platform was constructed near the southeastern ramp and four young males with their arms interlocked and missing their hands and skulls were laid out on the platform. Some researchers have concluded that the four men may represent the four cardinal directions. In a pit excavated next to these four men were placed the bodies of a large group of young women. This mass grave contained the remains of 53 females ranging in age between 15‚Äì30 years of age, arranged in two layers separated by matting. The young women show evidence of having been strangled before being arranged in neat rows in the pit. Analysis of bones and dental traits of these women have led archaeologists to believe these individuals were not from the same social class and ethnic group as other individuals interred in the mound. Non-metric dental traits have suggested that these individuals were not from the Cahokia area and were possibly immigrants new to the area. Analysis of specific carbon isotope and nitrogen isotope ratios left by maize consumption in the bones and cartilage of the women as well as pathologies indicative of poor health and nutritional stress; have led researchers to also conclude they were of a lower social status than elite burials in the mound, consuming more maize and less animal protein than elite individuals. The location after the removal of the timber circle and the final cap of Mound 72 This entire construction was then covered and extended even further toward Mound 72sub1 and now dubbed by archaeologists as Mound 72sub3. Next to this mound to the southwest another mass burial was made. This burial is the most grisly found at the site, containing 39 men and women who appear to have been violently killed. Before the mass interment a pit was dug and lined with white sand. The victims were then killed and thrown over the edge of the pit. These people showed signs of meeting a violent end, including several being incompletely decapitated, some with fractured skulls and others with fractured jawbones. The evidence shows that some of these individuals were buried alive: \\"From the vertical position of some of the fingers, which appear to have been digging in the sand, it is apparent that not all of the victims were dead when they were interred ‚Äì that some had been trying to pull themselves out of the mass of bodies.\\" The presence of arrowheads in the back of some of these victims, coupled with the beheadings and other evidence of violent death, has led some researchers to conclude that these victims show evidence of warfare or were even the losers of a rebellion against the rulers of Cahokia, possibly even objectors to the earlier sacrifices of the young women. On top of them were the remains of 15 elite individuals laid out upon litters made from cedar poles and cane matting . Radiocarbon dating of the cedar poles used for the litters in the top layer burials in this pit determined that this burial was made approximately 100 years after the woodhenge circle had been constructed, or in approximately 1030 CE. Numerous secondary bundle burials of the bones of individuals previously stored in a charnel house were also made into the mound. After a few final intrusive burials into the southwestern edge, Sub3 and Sub1 were covered over in a blanket of earth and given its distinctive ridgetop shape. All of the burials in the mound are located within an area circumscribed by the arc of the woodhenge circle. In total roughly 272 individuals had been interred in Mound 72. In all six separate episodes of burial had happened at the mound, stretching over roughly one hundred-year period. Researchers theorize that this could represent the lineage of a prominent family along with many retainers and sacrifices. Scholars believe almost 62 percent of the over 270 people interred in the mound were sacrificial victims, based on signs of ritual execution, method of burial, and other factors. =Similarities to historical events= The funeral procession of Tattooed Serpent in 1725, with retainers waiting to be sacrificed A similar ritual human sacrifice of retainers and commoners upon the death of an elite personage is attested in the historical record among the last remaining fully Mississippian culture in the southeastern US, the Natchez. Upon the death of \\"Tattooed Serpent\\" in 1725, the war chief and younger brother of the \\"Great Sun\\" or Chief of the Natchez; two of his wives, one of his sisters (nicknamed La Glorieuse by the French), his first warrior, his doctor, his head servant and the servant's wife, his nurse, and a craftsman of war clubs all chose to die and be interred with him, as well as several old women and an infant who was strangled by his parents. Great honor was associated with such a sacrifice, and their kin was held in high esteem. After a funeral procession with the chief's body carried on a litter made of cane matting and cedar poles ended at the temple (which was located on top of a low platform mound); the retainers with their faces painted red and accompanied by their relatives dressed up in their finest garments, were drugged with large doses of nicotine and ritually strangled. Tattooed Serpent was then buried in a trench inside the temple floor and the retainers were buried in other locations atop the mound surrounding the temple. After a few months time the bodies were dis-interred and their defleshed bones were stored as bundle burials in the temple. Mound 96 Mound 96 is a virtual mirror image of Mound 72 sub 1. It was another small nearly square platform mound measuring approximately wide at its base and a projecting ramp on its eastern side giving it a T-shape. It was built around the location of the winter sunset pole of the woodhenge and oriented along the north/south and east/west alignment common at Cahokia, with the ramp facing the winter solstice sunrise pole. The ramp starts at wide at its base, but narrows to in width at its top. Radiocarbon dating and ceramic analysis of sherds found in the mound place its beginning construction date to the Lohmann Phase (1000-1050 CE), at roughly the same time as Mound 72. The mound, also like Mound 72, was finished with a hard cap of black clay, thought by archaeologists to have been engineered by its builders as a protective layer to protect the mound from erosion. The mound is thought to contain burials as well, but due to new federal laws concerning the excavation of Native American remains the portions of the mound suspected to have burials have not been excavated. Excavations In the 1960s archaeologist Melvin L. Fowler noticed that the northeastern corner of the unusually aligned Mound 72 was located on a north/south axis aligned with the southwestern corner of Monks Mound and the western edge of Mound 49, an east/west oriented ridgetop mound located within the Grand Plaza area of downtown Cahokia. After discussions with Warren Wittry (the discoverer of the Cahokia Woodhenge) about the north/south axis alignment and the mounds longitudinal alignment along the axis of the solstices, he hypothesized that a large post may have marked the location. After getting funding he began a series of excavations at the mound in 1967 that lasted into the early 1970s. The post pit hole was found where he had predicted it would be, as were several others in an arc to the northwest, along with the spectacular series of burials located within and under the mound. Mound 96, a previously unnoticed small mound to the southwest, was discovered and numbered at this time. By 1977 Fowler was again studying aerial photos and maps of the location when he noticed that measurements concerning the two mounds and associated postholes corresponded nearly exactly with circumference and diameter measurements from Woodhenge III. He plotted a set of postholes predictions and eventually received funding to excavate in the early 1990s. In excavations lasting throughout the 1990s he excavated parts of Mound 96 and several projected posthole locations looking for proof of a hypothesized southern woodhenge at Cahokia. Not all archaeologists associated with Cahokia agreed with his conclusions and predictions at the time. Although weather- related problems, low-lying terrain with flooding issues and other factors made the endeavor difficult, Fowler eventually located several other post pits at or near their predicted locations, including the winter solstice sunset position under Mound 96.

She reached the final after defeating Russia's Tatiana Logunova and Estonia's Irina Embrich, but was overcome in the final by France's Laura Flessel. A scholarship from Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet allowed her to train harder. She received a wildcard for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, but lost in the quarter-finals to Germany's Britta Heidemann, who eventually became Olympic champion. In the 2009‚Äì10 season she climbed her first World Cup podium with a second place in Barcelona, followed by another silver medal in Luxembourg. She finished the season no.21 in world rankings, a career best as to 2015. In the 2011‚Äì12 season she won the Saint-Maur World Cup after prevailing over China's Sun Yujie. She sought to qualify to the 2012 Olympic Games, but failed against Laura Flessel-Colovic in the semifinal of the European qualifying tournament in Bratislava. In 2015, she failed to qualify to the final table of 64 in the Ciutat de Barcelona tournament, but lead Sweden to their first team World Cup victory since the 1970s. They defeated Australia, Hungary, Switzerland and Romania before meeting Italy in the final.

After his LifeAid medical alert necklace was inadvertently triggered, police came to his home and demanded that he open his front door. Despite his objections and statements that he did not need help, the police broke down Chamberlain's door. According to police, Chamberlain charged at them with a Knife and he was tasered, and then fatally shot. Chamberlain was a 68-year-old, black, retired Marine, and a 20-year veteran of the Westchester County Department of Corrections. He wore the medical alert pendant due to a chronic heart problem. The shooting was the topic of the 2019 film The Killing of Kenneth Chamberlain.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8906722/ Shooting At approximately 5:00 a.m., on November 19, 2011, Chamberlain was at home in the Winbrook Public Housing at 135 S. Lexington Avenue in White Plains, New York. His LifeAid medical alert necklace was triggered, sending an alert to a LifeAid customer service operator, who in turn called the City of White Plains Department of Public Safety. In response, police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians were dispatched. At Chamberlain's home, police knocked on his door. Chamberlain told them through the door, he did not call them, did not require assistance, was not having a medical emergency, and asked them to leave. Police refused to leave his home, and insisted that Chamberlain open the door. Throughout the entire incident, an audio recording was made by a LifeAid device in the home. The police became more insistent, and began banging on the door. Chamberlain then contacted the LifeAid operator asking them for help. He stated that the White Plains Police employees were going to enter his home and kill him. The police continued to bang on the door, and then attempted to force it open for approximately one hour. During that time, officer Steven Hart swore at him and called him a \\"nigger\\". Upon breaking down his door, they entered Chamberlain's apartment. Police alleged Chamberlain came at them with a butcher knife when they broke down the door. Chamberlain's family claims the elderly Chamberlain was unarmed,Graham Rayman. \\"Mentally ill Westchester man killed by cops may not have been wielding knife, new evidence suggests.\\" New York Daily News, October 29, 2016. and did not resist. Police tased him, and then shot him with a bean bag round fired from a shotgun. Chamberlain allegedly continued to charge at officers with the knife when Officer Anthony Carelli (whose name was withheld for over four months after the incident) shot him twice in the chest with live ammunition. A camera mounted on the taser captured the tasing, but was not functioning during the shooting. Chamberlain later died in surgery at White Plains Hospital. Autopsy An autopsy conducted on November 21, 2011, revealed that one bullet hit Chamberlain sideways, passing through his right arm and then both lungs. The other bullet seems to have missed. The autopsy, performed by Westchester County Chief Medical Examiner Kunjlata Ashar, also revealed taser burns on Chamberlain's neck and abdomen. Chamberlain's blood contained alcohol content of 0.11, and the muscle-relaxant cyclobenzaprine. The autopsy found \\"no drugs of abuse\\" in Chamberlain's system. Kenneth Chamberlain Jr. responded, \\"I'm glad the autopsy is out and shows that my father's hands were at his sides. It absolutely shows that my father wasn't the aggressor and that deadly force was not necessary.\\" Consequences =District Attorney and Grand jury inactions= In 2012, a grand jury reviewed the case and decided that no criminal charge would be made against police officers involved in the killing. Westchester District Attorney Janet DiFiore (now New York's Chief Judge) defended her decision not to prosecute Carelli and his colleagues on the grounds that they ‚Äúacted appropriately,‚Äù and that ‚Äúthere was no reasonable cause‚Äù to indict Carelli for murder. DiFiore also neglected to take any disciplinary action against officer Steven Hart for calling Chamberlain a ‚Äúnigger‚Äù. =Police department review= In May 2012, White Plains mayor Thomas Roach announced that he would bring in \\"outside experts to do a broad review of\\" policy for the city's police department. The commission's chair was Dr. Maria Haberfeld, a political science professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the academic coordinator for New York's Executive Police Institute. After a four-month investigation, the report concluded that Chamberlain's shooting was justifiable because it happened \\"after negotiations and when all non-lethal means were unsuccessful.\\" The family's lawyers and groups such as Blacks in Law Enforcement of America (BLEA) have criticized the report for failing to consider and address various issues. =Federal investigation= Chamberlain's family asked U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara for a \\"criminal investigation,\\" and in May 2012 the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that it would investigate whether federal civil rights law was violated. In January 2018, federal prosecutors decided not to bring any charges. =Petition= An online petition was created by the son of Kenneth Chamberlain Sr. By April 6, 2012, it had received nearly 199,900 signatures. It asks for an end to police misconduct and brutality, and for the officers involved to be \\"indicted and charged with murder and civil rights violations.\\" The petition will be delivered to the County District Attorney for Westchester, Janet DiFiore. Chamberlain Jr. said he was inspired by the petition circulated online by the parents of shooting victim Trayvon Martin, saying, \\"I signed Trayvon's petition, sat back and thought, 'Well, maybe I should do a petition.'\\" As of May 3, 2012, the petition had received at least 208,000 signatures. =Civil suit= On July 2, 2012, a federal civil suit for $21 million was filed by the victim's son, Kenneth Chamberlain Jr., against the City of White Plains and the White Plains Police Department. In November 2012, the Chamberlain family amended their lawsuit to require the city to modify police procedures with the mentally ill. The case went to trial on November 7, 2016. The jury found neither the police nor the city liable. The family has appealed, arguing that the judge improperly excluded evidence. The appellate court heard argument on March 22, 2018. =Appeals court decision= In June 2020, an appellate court ruled that the federal judge erred when she dismissed some of the claims in the lawsuit filed in 2011. The ruling restores claims of non-lethal excessive force and unlawful entry in the killing of Chamberlain. The court found that the lawsuit presented sufficient allegations that \\"a reasonable, experienced officer would not be justified in believing that entry into the apartment was necessary.\\" Chamberlain's son expressed joy upon hearing the ruling saying, \\"The appeals court has confirmed what we knew all along: That they violated my father's 4th Amendment rights.\\" Chamberlain Jr. and his lawyers noted and found it appropriate that the ruling came at a time of nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd. Accusations of racism Accusations of racism have been leveled at the police officers involved, at DA Janet DiFiore, and at law enforcement and justice systems that were reluctant to react. Chamberlain's son, Kenneth Chamberlain Jr., discussed these issues with lawyer Mayo Bartlett on Democracy Now, highlighting the absurdity of the police shooting a person they were summoned to help, as well as the unusual delay in the grand jury investigation. Chamberlain Jr. said \\"I wasn't trying to turn this into any type of racially motivated killing, until we heard the audio\\"‚Äîin particular, Hart's use of the word \\"nigger.\\" On February 15, 2012, Kenneth Chamberlain Jr. said his lawyers had filed a notice of claim informing the city, White Plains Public Safety Department, and White Plains Housing Authority to expect the wrongful death lawsuit. Demonstrations were held to protest racism and dereliction of duty by District Attorney Janet DiFiore. Damon K. Jones, representing Blacks in Law Enforcement of America, demanded that DiFiore be investigated by Preet Bharara's office. =White Plains Police Department= Lawyer Mayo Bartlett points out that the White Plains police system wrote their reports to cover up racism and wrongdoing by the officers. Their transcript of the incident omitted Hart's use of the word \\"nigger,\\" as well as the information that the original call had been for a medical emergency. Public Safety Commissioner David Chong said in a May 3, 2012 statement that the Police Department would conduct an internal review of the incident and fully cooperate with an independent study to be done by a panel of experts to review the department's policies and procedures and recommend any improvements.

Based on assessment, students are placed in one of five proficiency levels, from beginner level to advanced. The school recognizes that much of language learning comes from living and experiencing it in normal, structured, and unstructured activities. Structured language constructs are taught once a natural acquisition of spoken English has developed. However, when students are ready, teachers introduce active, direct, and explicit instructional methods which give students abundant opportunities to learn and produce new and more complex English language structures. The goal of the program is that students graduate with true bilingual language skills, readily comfortable working and speaking in both English and Portuguese.  Facilities  The School's facilities include climatized classrooms, an English-language library, a theatre studio, IT lab, pool, student garden and play yard, an early childhood playlot, a cafeteria with full-service lunch and snack options, and two sports courts offering extracurricular activities including futsal, volleyball and judo.

Based in Boston, Janji sells apparel with designs representing Haiti, Rwanda, Peru, Tanzania, the U.S. and Kenya, the countries in which Janji has ongoing efforts. Part of the profit from each sale goes toward charities based in that country. \\"Janji\\" means \\"promise\\" in Malay, and refers to Janji's promise to \\"run for another,\\" the company's slogan. History Janji was founded by students on the cross country team at Washington University in St. Louis. While travelling to the 2010 NCAA Division III Track & Field Championships, David Spandorfer and Michael Burnstein came up with the idea of a creating a running clothes company that gives back. After gaining David Hamm as head designer and Ken Fairleigh, the group turned Janji into a legitimate and growing company over the next two years. In 2011, the group won the top prize in the Youthbridge Social Enterprise and Innovation Competition (SEIC) at Washington University, earning Janji $15,000 for their efforts. In October of that same year, the group earned their company $20,000 in start-up money when they took another first in the UCCS Sports/Outdoors Business Plan Competition. In May 2012, Janji launched their product line at Big River Running, a specialty running store in St. Louis, Missouri. Their first line of clothing sponsored two countries, Kenya and Haiti. Over the course of the summer of 2012, Janji slowly released in multiple running stores around the country. As of June 19, 2012, product orders had been placed by 92 specialty running stores in 28 states around the country. The original name of the business was \\"Edele.\\" They changed the name, co-founder David Spandorfer said, because people could not figure out how to pronounce \\"Edele\\" and often confused the name with Adele. \\"Janji,\\" its current and permanent name, means \\"promise\\" in Malay. Product Lines Janji's first product line released shirts and shorts designed based on the flags of Haiti and Kenya. They featured two shirts and two pairs of shorts for each gender in four sizes. The women's pair of Run for Haiti shorts features the country's national colors and bird. Currently, the company features short and long sleeved tops, shorts, tights, pants, and accessories like headbands and hats for both women and men, representing six countries (Haiti, Rwanda, Peru, Tanzania, U.S., Kenya) Charities Janji works with partner organizations based in the countries they sponsor. Part of the proceeds from each sale goes toward a direct donation to a charity organization. In Haiti, Janji works with water.org, a non-profit dedicated to bringing clean water and aid to regions of developing countries. Through the partnership, the community of Bayas received a clean water pump in order to prevent further outbreaks of cholera from unfiltered water. Each piece of Haiti-themed apparel purchased provides one year of water to a person in Haiti. Janji also works alongside water.org in Kenya, where 17.5 million people lack access to proper sanitation. Now, 32% of the population have access to improved sanitation through water.org's WaterCredit initiatives that provide safe water access to schools and households. Each piece of Kenya-themed apparel purchased provides one year of water to an individual or an organization in Kenya. In Peru, Janji works with Living Water International to bring clean water access in order to lower mortality rates from hepatitis and diarrhea, which are water-bourne diseases from the Amazon River. Roughly 35% of rural Peruvians lack access to clean water and the infant mortality rate is near 15%. Because of Living Water International and Janji's efforts, a number of remote tribes now have access to clean drinking water. Each piece of Peru-themed apparel purchased provides four months of clean water to a family there. Living Water Rwanda partners with Janji in Rwanda in order to provide more locally accessible clean water. Women in Rwanda walk roughly 7 miles or 20 hours a week in order to fetch water that is unsanitary. Living Water Rwanda has completed over 395 projects in the country. Each piece of Rwanda-themed apparel purchased provides clean water for a year to a Rwandan. In Tanzania, Janji and MSABI partner together to create access to sanitation and clean water. Over half of the diseases that affect the population are the result of unsafe drinking water, and in rural areas, 420,000 people lack this access. MSABI also provides educational programs that have reached over 350,000 Tanzanians. Each piece of Janji's Tanzanian-themed outerwear provides three years of clean water access to a person in Tanzania; all other apparel provides one year of access. Janji also wants to tackle the problem at home as well as abroad. In the United States, the Navajo population is 67% more likely than other Americans to live without running water or a toilet, and 40% of the Navajo population in New Mexico live without these amenities. DIGDEEP Right to Water Project (http://www.digdeep.org/) has brought clean sanitation access to over 250 American homes and through Janji, one piece of USA apparel provides a week of clean water to an American family. In an interview with a local newspaper in Brookline, Massachusetts, Michael Burnstein, co-founder, emphasized that Janji looks for organizations that provide \\"innovative\\" and \\"proven\\" solutions to the global water crisis, ones that, \\"attack the problem at the root,\\" highlighting water.org's, Living Water International's, DIGDEEP's and MSABI's partnerships.

The term was popular in the early 20th century.Race and Racism: An Introduction (see also) by Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban, Pages 127-133, Publication Date: December 8, 2005, The Races of Europe by Carleton S. Coon History In his Die Mediterranen in Wales (1935), Egon Freiherr von Eickstedt coined the term \\"Atlantid\\" to denote a phenotype he stated was common in the British Isles. According to Bertil Lundman, it is synonymous with Joseph Deniker's earlier postulated \\"North-Occidental\\" or \\"North-Western\\" race, and also Czekanowski's \\"Northern-Western\\" subracial taxonomy.Lundman, 1943, p. 134; 1977, p. 33. In the 1940s Lundman adopted the term \\"North-Atlantid\\" to cover these earlier terminologies, and further popularised it in The Races and Peoples of Europe (1977). Physical appearance The Atlantid or North-Atlantid, as described by Eickstedt and Lundman, is recognised as having a pigmentation between the Nordic and Atlanto-Mediterranid stock of the Mediterranean.Eickstedt, 1935; Lundman, 1946, p. 17. While the pigmentation of the eyes is light, the hair in contrast is dark brown.Lundman, 1977, p. 33. The Atlantid is essentially a \\"Nordic- Mediterranean\\" blend, a term appearing in the literature of Earnest Hooton, but can differ in its exact gradient of pigmentation. Although usually recognised as intermediate between Nordic and Mediterranean, Deniker discussed what he saw occasionally as stronger Nordic or Mediterranean gradients.Deniker, 1900, p. 328; 343. Geography and origin Lundman notes that the North-Atlantid phenotype is mainly found across British Isles, but also in some other North Sea coastal areas. There are two theories on the origin of the Atlantid phenotype, according to Lundman's theory the North- Atlantid came about through only a partial northern depigmentation: References Sources * Joseph Deniker, The Races of Man, W.

History The community is believed to have been named for a salty stream that was frequently rendered muddy by animals drinking from it. Natural mineral licks, whether associated with brine springs or just mineral-rich soils, were frequented by animals that literally licked the ground to ingest the salt or other trace minerals, often creating a muddy surface. Big Bone Lick in Boone County, Kentucky, is a famous example, but many such ‚Äúlicks‚Äù were known to American pioneer hunters and settlers. ‚ÄúSulphur Lick‚Äù is a community name of similar origin in northeast Monroe County.

The painting depicts the dead body of a woman washed up beneath the arch of Waterloo Bridge, with her lower body still immersed in the water of the River Thames. She is presumed to have drowned after having thrown herself in the river in despair to escape the shame of being a \\"fallen woman\\". The grey industrial cityscape of the south bank of the Thames is barely visible in the background through thick smog. Dressed simply, perhaps a servant, her arms and body form the shape of a cross, much remeniscent of the crucifiction of Christ. She holds a locket and chain in one hand, indicating her attachment to her lover, with a single star visible as a sign of hope in the sky above. It is one of four large social realist paintings made by Watts in 1848-50, created soon after he had returned to England from an extended period in Italy. All on melancholy themes, the others are Under the Dry Arch, The Irish Famine, and Song of the Shirt (after Hood's poem The Song of the Shirt; this painting is also known as The Seamstress). Several other artists were inspired by Hood's poem The Bridge of Sighs. Examples of similar works include Rossetti's Found and Abraham Solomon's Drowned! Drowned!. The scene is echoed in the third painting of Augustus Egg's 1858 series, Past and Present. Watts quickly abandoned his dalliance with social realism, and returned to allegorical themes. He never sold his four social realist paintings, which were first exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1881-82 and are now all held by the Watts Gallery in Compton, near Guildford in Surrey.

It features gameplay reminiscent of arcade games like Qix ‚Äî players control a monkey named Urusu-San as he must complete each level by destroying all of the tiles off the grid of a 3D object. Most levels revolve around the player slowly removing the clothing off of women, alongside destroying cobras, UFOs, and cardboard boxes. There are enemies that must be avoided, and there are also power-ups that grant different abilities. The game runs on the Namco System 11 hardware. Created by Masateru Umeda, the designer for Namco's The Outfoxies, Dancing Eyes has gained notoriety for its sexual nature and comical design. Its characters were animated using motion capture, many of whom were voiced by well-known figures in the anime industry. Namco executives were skeptical of the game during production, as it broke away from the company's traditional family-friendly model. The game was openly disliked by publications in its initial release, who viewed it as \\"inappropriate\\" for arcades. Retrospectively, it has been praised for its quirky characters and fun gameplay, often being compared to games such as Qix or Gals Panic. A remake was announced for the PlayStation 3 under the Namco Generations series, but was cancelled. Gameplay Gameplay of Dancing Eyes Dancing Eyes is a 3D puzzle game, with gameplay often compared to Qix (1981). The player controls a monkey named Urusu-San, who must complete each level by eliminating all tiles off the grid of a 3D object. In most cases, the level involves the player destroying the clothing off of women, however it can also revolve around destroying UFOs, cardboard boxes, and a cobra around a trapped body builder. Enemies will appear and give direct chase to the player, which must be avoided or will cost the player a life. There are also power-ups that appear that give Urusu-San different abilities, such as a speed boost or the ability to increase in size. Completing a level allows the player to briefly round whatever object was in the level as it poses for the camera. Development and release Dancing Eyes was created by Masateru Umeda and a team of six others within Namco. Umeda is best known as the designer of The Outfoxies, a 1995 fighting game that is seen as a predecessor to the Super Smash Bros. series. It was programmed for the Namco System 11 board, a 3D arcade system based on raw PlayStation hardware. The production team used motion capture to animate the game's characters, several of whom were voiced by prominent voice actors within the anime industry. Each of the characters were given their own personality and backstory so they would not be memorable for just their sex appeal. One of the characters, \\"Bunny\\", was modeled after one of the developer's gym instructor. Due to Dancing Eyes being a drastic departure from their usual family-friendly image, Namco executives were unsure about the project during development. The game was published in Japan in September 1996. Promotional material acknowledged the strange concept and characters. Reception and legacy The arcade game magazine Game Machine reported that Dancing Eyes was among the most popular arcade games during the month of October 1996. Retrospectively, the game has gained attention for its risque, comical nature. Writing for GamePro, Ray Barnholt likened its gameplay to Taito's Qix and Kaneko's Gals Panic series, finding it to be fun and one that doesn't take itself seriously. He also complemented the graphics for being impressive at the time, as well as for it not solely relying on its suggestive themes. Barnholt wrote: \\"Despite the groan-worthy sexism going on, Dancing Eyes doesn't really take itself seriously. It shows that if you take out the suggestive material, you can still have a fairly fun game on your hands.\\" Arttu Yl√§rakkola of GameSetWatch described it as \\"a perfect example of the kind of Japanese arcade weirdness that gets giggles from anyone who's ever seen the game\\". He stated that the game itself was of low quality, but had an odd charm to it through its bizarre premise and simplistic gameplay. Retro Gamer compared it to Konami's Amidar, commenting on its strange, sexual theme and \\"nutty\\" concept. They said that it was a \\"surprisingly polished\\" game, with good gameplay and responsive controls. Retro Gamer also found the lack of a PlayStation conversion surprising, due to the arcade system being based on PlayStation hardware. In 2011, Namco Bandai Games announced that a high- definition remaster of Dancing Eyes was in production for the PlayStation 3 as part of their Namco Generations line of modernized arcade game remakes. Although it was announced as being exclusive to Japan, English translations options hinted at a possibility of it seeing an international release. It was also compatible with the PlayStation Move motion-based peripheral. The announcement generated confusion and distaste from several publications, who commented on the game's sexual appeal and bizarre premise. The company became quiet about the project for over a year, until it was announced as being cancelled in 2012 for \\"various circumstances\\". Push Square believes the game's controversy was a factor in its cancellation.

Yelovichnus was originally believed to be an ichnotaxon: its fossils, because of their \\"meandering nature\\", were initially thought to be feeding trails left by other life forms, such as annelids or mollusks. Better- preserved specimens later demonstrated that the fossils were not true feeding trails, as there was no evidence of turning by the life form that supposedly left them. The fossils are now recognized as belonging to an organism taking the form of \\"collapsed, segmented tubes\\", possibly an alga or a protist. It has also been argued that Yelovichnus and similar organisms are xenophyophores, large but single-cellular organisms that exist today in the abyssal zone. Due to similar structures found in their fossils, it is theorized that Yelovichnus may be related to Palaeopascichnus, as well as Aspidella and Neonereites. The main difference between Yelovichnus and Palaeopasicichnus is the shape of their segments: the segments of Yelovichnus took the shape of \\"closed, ovate-shaped loops\\", whereas the segments of Palaeopascichnus were quite varied in shape. The genus and species was described by Mikhail A. Fedonkin in 1985 from the Ediacaran (Vendian) deposits of the White Sea area, Russia. Yelovichnus was named after the Yeloviy Creek near the locality.M. A. Fedonkin (1985). In Sokolov, B. S. and Iwanowski, A.

The British also had two other vessels on Lake Nyasa named Chauncy Maples and Queen Victoria.\\" The 350 ton vessel was launched at Fort Johnston in 1899, and named after Lady Gwendolen Cecil, the then 29-year-old unmarried daughter of the Marquess of Salisbury. \\"The steamer, which was christened the Gwendolen, after Lord Salisbury's daughter, is 136 ft. long, 24 ft. beam, 19 ft. moulded depth, and has a mean draught of 5 ft. 6 in. Although her tonnage is not registered, 350 tons is a fair ...\\" In 1907 the Gwendolen was the largest of three vessels formerly used as gunboats, the others being the and the Queen Victoria, with four civilian steamers on the lake. \\"This consists of three vessels, formerly used as gunboats, including the Gwendolen, 350 tons, launched in 1899 at Fort Johnston, which is the headquarters of the department. For ordinary traffic there are 4 small steamers on the Lake ... From 1914 she was commanded by Captain Edmund Rhoades who attacked the Hermann von Wissman, the vessel of his friend and former drinking partner Captain Berndt, by surprise, with Berndt having been unaware that war had started. \\"Rhoades was then startled to see his enraged German counterpart and old drinking partner, Captain Berndt, leap into a dinghy and climb aboard the Gwendolyn screaming curses and questioning Rhoades's sanity. It transpired that news of the war had not reached Liuli.

The largest waves are usually seen between May and September, the pre-monsoon and monsoon season. Some of the spots for surfing in India are Mangalore, Manipal, Kapu Beach, Sasihithlu and Murdeshwara in Karnataka, Mahabalipuram, Kovalam (Covelong) and Manapad in Tamil Nadu, Kovalam Kovalam and Varkala in Kerala, Little Andamans and Lakshadweep. Stand up paddling and surfing as in the current form was not a familiar sport to Indians, until recently when things started to change, starting with the coastal villages and the coastal communities. \\"The kids here are born and brought up around these waters and this sport comes too easily to them,\\" says Madhumathi of Bay of Life Surf School \\"You power the board. It does not need any mechanism\\", And once you start paddling, you will be introduced to the vast eco-system that is right in your backyard. There are mangroves, schools of dolphins; we've even spotted a whale shark once- says Madhumathi Ravi The first surf camp in India happened in 2011 at Chennai, Tamil Nadu, organised by Bay of Life in association with The Surfing federation of India marked the beginning of surfing as a popular, organised sport in the country. \\"There are, it must be said, big pluses and minuses about surfing in India. The greatest plus point right now about grabbing your surf board and heading to the ocean anywhere in the country, is that you will not have too much company. That was a key factor that attracted Ed Templeton and his wife Sofie, the co-owners of Surf & Soul in Varkala. \\"The surf was good, the water warm, and the most attractive part was that there was nobody else in the water. Where else in the world do you get that?\\" says Ed. On most days the waves are likely to be quite gentle‚Äîanywhere between . The waters are good enough for most surfers. You can go stand up paddling any time of the year. The best time for surfing is between September and November and then again in March, April and May. June, July and August are only suitable for professionals. India's beaches does not have a consistent life guard program except few regions like Goa or Kovalam in Chennai (run independently by Bay of Life Chennai) hence it's better you surf with a buddy at all times. Try already explored surf spots first: It's sensible to first cover familiar surf spots in India before attempting to search for new ones. This way you get familiar to Indian environments, currents and local knowledge before attempting remote locations.Watch out for Currents: It's better to familiarise yourself with rips and currents pertaining to the surf spot by asking around and talking to fellow surfers, local fishermen of that area. Local Culture and Activities: Make sure you dress appropriately for different beaches in India, some regions are more orthodox than the others. Drinking on the beach, dressing provocatively might sometime invite unwanted trouble. Watch out for that fishing boat! Surfing Federation of India is the governing body for surfing in India.

He played college football at Oregon State, where he finished his career as the Beaver with the sixth-most starts in school history. He signed as an undrafted free agent with the Denver Broncos in 2012. He‚Äôs had stints with nine different franchises in his NFL career. Early years Remmers was born in Portland, Oregon. His father, Wally Remmers, played football at Oregon State University in the mid-1970s, and his older brother, Vic, played basketball for the Beavers from 2002 to 2006. He attended Jesuit High School in his native Portland, where he was a three-year letterwinner at left tackle and defensive end and earned second-team All-Metro honors at both positions as Jesuit won two state football titles during his varsity career. As a senior offensive lineman who stood at 6'5\\" (1.96 m) and weighed only 220 pounds (100 kg), Remmers did not get a single scholarship offer, however he qualified academically and was given the opportunity to be a preferred walk-on for OSU. Remmers also earned one letter in basketball at Jesuit.Panthers OL Mike Remmers finally gets regular job College career Remmers in 2011 at OSU Remmers played for the Oregon State Beavers from 2007 to 2011. Remmers redshirted his freshman season in 2007 when the Beavers went 9-4, and when starting right tackle Tavita Thompson was ruled ineligible to begin the 2008 season, Remmers started the first seven games in his place, helping the Beavers rank second in the conference in total offense with an average of 407.1 yards per game. After the season, Oregon State gave Remmers a full scholarship. In 2009, his sophomore year, Remmers assembled himself in the starting line-up and provided protection for an OSU offense that led the conference in passing with an average of 270.8 yards per game. He was an All- Pac-12 Conference honorable mention in his junior year and was a finalist for the Burlsworth Trophy, which is given annually to the best player in the country who began his career as a walk-on. As a senior. he again started all 12 games at left tackle. Since given a full scholarship, Remmers went on to start every game for the rest of his college career, and his 44 career starts ranked sixth in Beavers‚Äô history at the time of his graduation.

Remmers was signed off the Rams‚Äô practice squad in October 2014 by the Carolina Panthers. During a rough stretch of the season the Panthers continued to make changes to their offensive line lineup, hoping to hit on a group that would gel. When injuries struck prior to the Week 13 Minnesota Vikings game, Remmers got his shot. With the newly installed Remmers at right tackle and Andrew Norwell at left guard, the O-line finally hit a groove. Though the game was a close loss, the coaching staff liked the lineup and Remmers remained a starter for the remainder of the season. During the 2015 NFL Draft, the Panthers selected offensive tackle Daryl Williams out of Oklahoma in the fourth round. Williams and Remmers would compete for the right tackle spot during training camp, with Remmers ultimately winning out. Remmers would go on to start at right tackle for the rest of the season as the Panthers went 17-1 in both the regular season and playoffs and made it to Super Bowl 50 against the Denver Broncos. Remmers had the worst professional game of his career in the Super Bowl as he was primarily matched up against the eventual game MVP Von Miller, allowing multiple pressures and two sacks, both of which led to fumbles recovered by Denver.http://www.todayspigskin.com/nfc/carolina-panthers/mike-remmers- putting-super-bowl-past/ During training camp for the 2016 season, Remmers again competed with Daryl Williams for a starting position. Once more, Remmers won and entered the season as the Panthers' starting right tackle. However, in Week 4, against the Atlanta Falcons, with fellow tackle Michael Oher unable to play because of a concussion, Remmers drew the start as the Panther's left tackle. He would wind up remaining the Panther's starting left tackle throughout the remainder of the season, as Oher never returned from his concussion. =Second stint with the Vikings= On March 10, 2017, Remmers signed a five-year, $30 million contract with the Minnesota Vikings.

The subsidiary later offered webtoons, anime, playable games, music, message boards, and graphic novels as well. ShiftyLook regularly held substantial exhibitions at large US comics conventions, having a major booth presences and holding large giveaways of promotional merchandise. ShiftyLook shut down on September 30, 2014. History ShiftyLook was headed by editor-in-chief Robert Pereyda. The idea behind the company was to revive Namco's more obscure, dormant video game franchises for mediums such as webcomics and animations. Pereyda believed that entertainment formats like webcomics were largely successful, and that if these intellectual properties become popular through them, it could garner more interest in those series and make Namco Bandai interested in creating new games for them. Namco Bandai also believed that ShiftyLook was a venue for content creators to collaborate on projects, and to establish working relations with artists and developers for future projects. In an interview with CRB.com, Pereyda stated: \\"Basically, what we're doing is taking a look at stuff that's forgotten IPs, stuff that's sleeping, stuff that ‚Äî just to be honest ‚Äî some people don't care about and thinking what we can do with it. This is a big system and we know that not everything's going to succeed, but if some of them can make it to the big time, we've done a good job. We're casting a really wide net. We're doing different styles, different artists, different kinds of titles, just filling out a whole matrix of different things we can do and then seeing where that goes.\\" If the webcomics were successful, Pereyda hoped that content such as merchandise and print versions would be available as well. The old ShiftyLook logo ShiftyLook officially launched on March 9, 2012. Five webcomics were announced to begin production under the company; Bravoman, Xevious, Sky Kid, Rocket Fox, and Alien Confidential: Black and White. Comics were made available for free on the website, all without advertisements aside from those for Bandai Namco's other projects. In June 2012, ShiftyLook announced that Japanese manga artist Hitoshi Ariga would begin work on a webcomic based on Klonoa, becoming the first ShiftyLook comic created outside North America. To increase their viewer base, ShiftyLook regularly attended fan conventions in their own booth, where they featured artists behind some of their comics as well as merchandise. A YouTube channel was launched in 2013, featuring short animated series based on Bravoman and Mappy. The same year, Namco Bandai released an endless runner game based on Bravoman, titled Bravoman: Binja Bash!, for iOS and Android devices. ShiftyLook also published Wonder Momo: Typhoon Booster, a sequel to Wonder Momo developed by WayForward, and Namco High, a comical dating simulator game designed by Homestuck creator Andrew Hussie. A five episode anime series based on Wonder Momo began in January 2014 on Crunchyroll. On March 10, 2014, ShiftyLook announced that their site would no longer be updated beginning March 20, and by September 30 the company and website would be shut down entirely. They also announced that their YouTube channel, mobile games, and other digital merchandise would be pulled.

Coryell Judie attended Marlin High School and played football, basketball, baseball, and competed in track and field events (long jump, 100m, 4 √ó 100 m relay and 200m) Coryell Judie joined his high school football team his senior year of high school, playing both wide receiver and cornerback. Although it was his first time playing varsity football, Judie earned First-Team All-District honors as a wide- receiver for UIL Class 22-2A under Marlin High Football Coach Jerry Malone. Judie was not recruited out of high school but still pursued a college football career by enrolling at Fort Scott Community College in Fort Scott, Kansas. While at Fort Scott, Coryell Judie honed his skills a lockdown corner back and earned his Junior College All-American Award as a freshman in 2008. That year he recorded 44 tackles, 6 interceptions, and 7 pass breakups causing his reputation as a close cover corner to be known. Judie was heavily recruited by colleges and universities around the country before committing to Texas A&M; University in Spring 2009. He joined Texas A&M; team in the summer of 2009 as one of the first junior college transfers that Coach Mike Sherman recruited. His career got off to a rocky start with a season ending shoulder injury in the opening game of the Aggies 2009 season causing Judie to medical red-shirt that year. Coryell Judie would bounce back stronger and more powerful during his Junior year with the Aggies in 2010. He proved to be a menacing cover corner playing in all 13 games of which he earned starts in 10 of the games. Judie also proved to be a dangerous return man with his speed, returning a 100-yard kick off return for a touchdown in the Texas A&M; versus Oklahoma game at Kyle Field, which earned him Big 12 Special Teams Player of the Week. One week later, he would earn that same honor again, when he proved to be just as dangerous in yet another kick off return for 84 yards for a touchdown against the Baylor Bears at Floyd Casey Stadium in Waco, Texas. Coryell Judie holds the record of being the first Aggie to return kickoffs for back-to-back touchdowns in school history. Judie ended the season with Second- Team All Big 12 Honors. Coryell Judie returned with the Aggies for the 2010-2011 season but injuries would soon find him again. Judie suffered a hamstring injury that caused him to miss multiple games that season. Judie took it slow, rehabbed, and recovered from the injury to return and finish the season out with his Aggie teammates. He played his last game for the Aggies at the Meineke Bowl Game in Houston, Texas. This would be Judie's last game as an Aggie as he would declare for the NFL Draft. Judie was invited to the 2012 NFL Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana, which he did attend. Although he performed well amongst those in his draft class, Judie would not be drafted in the 2012 NFL Draft. Although undrafted, Judie was signed by the Denver Broncos as an undrafted free agent in 2012.

Silent Hill 2 centers on widower James Sunderland who travels to the titular town after receiving a letter from his dead wife, while Silent Hill 3 is a direct sequel to the first Silent Hill game and focuses on Heather Mason, a teenager who finds herself in conflict with the town's cult. Both games are categorized as survival horror and share gameplay elements with each other. Published worldwide by Konami beginning with North America in March 2012, the compilation features a graphics overhaul, new voice acting, and Xbox achievements and PlayStation trophies. The Silent Hill HD Collection was in development for more than two years. The development team had to work with incomplete source code provided by Konami, as the published source code had not been archived; as a result they had to fix technical issues both arising from porting the two games and those that the original development team had previously dealt with. An arrangement was eventually reached between the original voice actors of Silent Hill 2 and Konami to allow for an option to have the original voice acting present in Silent Hill 2s port; the port of Silent Hill 3 does not have that option. Critics were divided over the Silent HD Collection, particularly in regards to its updated graphics and voice acting. Some enjoyed it as an updated presentation of two favorably regarded games, while others criticized the quality of the compilation, citing the technical issues. Background and development The Silent Hill HD Collection, a compilation of the high- definition remastered video game ports of Silent Hill 2 (2001) and Silent Hill 3 (2003), spent more than two years in development. Silent Hill 2 follows widower James Sunderland as he journeys through the fog-shrouded town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his dead wife. Silent Hill 3, in contrast, is a direct sequel to the first Silent Hill game, centering on Heather Mason, a teenager who finds herself entangled in a plot to revive an evil god. Both games belong to the survival horror genre and as such, their gameplay elements overlap. Access to the various environments within the games' worlds is limited, and progression through a particular area or building generally entails finding the relevant keys, which are sometimes obtained after solving a puzzle; puzzles often take the form of riddles and sometimes consist of gathering various items to help solve them. \\"Health\\" restoratives and a limited range of weapons and ammunition to fight off various hostile creatures can be obtained. Both games have multiple endings available. The Silent Hill HD Collection featured 720p resolution, a 16:9 aspect ratio, a frame rate of 30 frames per second, achievements for Xbox Live, and trophies for PlayStation Network. A comparison of the original PlayStation 2 version of Silent Hill 2 (right) and its remastered PlayStation 3 port before the patch (left) Because the original source code for Silent Hill 2 and 3 had not been preserved, the development team at Hijinks Studio had to work with the incomplete code provided by video game publisher Konami, which was not the code from the published games. Thus, the team had to simultaneously handle technical issues arising from porting the two games as well as those which the original development team had previously fixed; some of those problems included Heather turning blue. Furthermore, the team examined game textures that were present in the original games but not seen by the players, and highlighted them in the remaster; among the previously unseen textures and details are scratches on walls and clues to the games' puzzles. Masahiro Ito, the art director for Silent Hill 2 and 3, has speculated that the games' translucent textures, such as those used for the fog, might have proven difficult for the hardware of the PlayStation 3 to handle. New voice actors were brought in to re-record dialogue from both games, directed by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, who had previously provided vocals for various soundtracks in the Silent Hill series. Because the games kept the original animations, the voice actors had to sync their vocal performance with the lip motions done by the previous voice actors. Guy Cihi, who had provided the original voice and motion capture for James Sunderland in Silent Hill 2s original release, refused to allow Konami to re-use his voice work in the remaster because he believed that the company owed him residuals for his performance. Troy Baker, the new voice actor for James Sunderland, disputed this, arguing that residuals for voice acting in video games were unheard of in Japan. Eventually, an arrangement between Konami and the original voice actors of Silent Hill 2 was reached to provide an option for the original voice acting on the remastered port of Silent Hill 2; Silent Hill 3, however, did not have that option, with \\"technical and logistical\\" difficulties cited. During the production of the Silent Hill HD Collection, senior associate producer Tomm Hulett was the target of harassment by a small portion of the Silent Hill fanbase, being blamed as the source of everything perceived as wrong in the series, including lost source code, the inclusion of new voice acting in the Silent Hill HD Collection, and that Silent Hill: Book of Memories was a dungeon crawler. =Release= The compilation was officially announced by Konami at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2011, with an expected release date later that fall. Although the game was initially revealed as a PlayStation 3 (PS3) exclusive, Konami later added an Xbox 360 port that would also be published on the same day as the PS3 release. The release date was later pushed back to March 2012, slated to be published alongside two other upcoming installments in the franchise, Silent Hill: Downpour and Silent Hill: Book of Memories. The compilation was published on March 20 in North America, on March 29 in Japan, on March 30 in Europe, and on April 5 in Australia. Only the PS3 edition was published in Japan. A patch to address some of the game's technical issues, including the frame rate, issues with the fog, and audio- syncing, was released for the PS3 edition in July 2012; a patch for the Xbox 360 version was proposed but later canceled in August. The compilation was made backwards compatible for the Xbox One in July 2018. Reception The Silent Hill HD Collection received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews on both consoles, according to rating aggregator Metacritic. Several reviewers voiced their opinion that the title of the collection was misleading, as it only contained only two games from the franchise and excluded Silent Hill 4: The Room, Silent Hill: Origins and the first Silent Hill game, particularly given that the first two had appeared on the PlayStation 2 console as well. The updated visuals were a point of contention among reviewers: some wrote that the loss of fog in Silent Hill 2 revealed previously hidden textures and technical limitations of the game to its detriment; the updates to Silent Hill 3, which did not depend on the effects of the fog as much, were generally better received. In contrast, other reviewers enjoyed the updated visuals. Glitches and issues with the frame rate were also noted. The new voice acting drew a range of responses. Some critics praised it as a general improvement over the originals, while others expressed more mixed feelings about it. Issues with the audio syncing with the character animations was remarked on, and some critics wrote that the subtitles had not been updated to reflect the few changes made to the script. The absence of bonus material drew criticism from some reviewers as well. Overall opinions on the compilation was mixed. Some enjoyed it as a nicely updated port of two well-regarded games, while others recommended it despite technical faults. Other reviewers wrote that the quality of the compilation was lacking, especially in comparison to other recently released remastered compilations, such as the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection.

Cum universi () is a papal bull written by Pope Celestine III, issued on 13 March 1192. The bull ended the claim of the Archbishop of York to metropolitan jurisdiction in Scotland and established an independent national church, albeit one with no figurehead.  Background  Before the bull's publication, the church in Scotland had no metropolitan authority by way of an archbishop. Attempts had been made by Pope Paschal II in 1100 to attach the metropolitan authority of the Archbishop of York to Scotland in his letter Noscat dilectio, which he addresses \\"to the suffragans of the metropolis of York per Scotiam\\". Noscat dilectio was written on the promotion of Gerard, Bishop of Hereford to the archbishopric of York, commanding the Scottish bishops to obey Gerard and accept his authority, which the Scottish bishops refused to do. On the consecration of Archbishop Thurstan of York by Pope Calixtus II, a more vigorous campaign was mounted insisting York's authority be recognised in Scotland. Although both Calixtus and successive popes commanded the obedience of the Scottish bishops to York, the bishops of St. Andrews and Glasgow refused, abetted by both King Alexander and King David. In April 1125, Pope Honorius II wrote to King David commanding him to receive Cardinal John of Crema as papal legate to investigate the matter of the continued controversy with the metropolitan authority of the Archbishop Thurstan and the Scottish bishops. The inquiry was fruitless and in 1126, the pope summoned the Scottish bishops to Rome during Lent 1127 for an inquiry on their relationship with York. The meeting was, however, aborted.  Consecration of Scottish Bishops  During the controversy, when a Scottish bishop required consecration it should have been performed by the Archbishop of York. Due to vacancies arising in both sees concurrently, however, Bishop John and his successor Herbert were consecrated by the pope himself. The pattern then continued even when the See of York was not vacant, when Herbert's successor, Engelram, was consecrated by Pope Alexander III. Engelram's successor, Jocelyn was consecrated at Clairvaux by a papal legate.  Rights established by the bull  The bull arose as a result of the controversy, and for the first time in the ecclesiastical history of Scotland, the church is referred to an entity (Scotticana ecclesia), comprising the dioceses of St. Andrews, Glasgow, Dunkeld, Dunblane, Brechin, Aberdeen, Moray, Ross and Caithness. The bull then goes on to outline the rights attached to the church: * The church was a 'special daughter' of the apostolic see with no intermediary. * No one could impose an interdict in the kingdom of Scotland except the pope or his legate. * No foreigner could be a legate in Scotland unless specifically sent by the pope. * The liberties and realm and churches granted by previous popes were confirmed by Celestine. * Disputes which rose within the realm of Scotland could not be heard outside it, unless there was a direct appeal to the Holy See. The bull is viewed as a pivotal moment in the history of the medi√¶val Scottish church and instrumental in the removal of English influences in Scottish ecclesiastical affairs.

The magnitude of the shift typically ranges from 0.2 to 1.0 √Ö. There are two possible mechanisms that can cause impurity ion displacement. If the impurity ion is smaller than the regular ion (by 10% or more), the displacement arises because the repulsive forces between the impurity ion and its nearest neighbors stabilizing the ion at the regular site are strongly weakened.Smoluchowski R.

If the impurity ion is bigger than the regular ion, the displacement arises because of different covalency of the chemical bonds with the nearest neighbors for the impurity and regular ions. Off-center position of substitutional ions was first discovered in lithium-doped KCl by two groups of American physicists in 1965. Since these pioneer works crystals with off-center impurity ions have attracted continuous attention. The cause of such interest is that these crystals can be used as good model objects for the investigation of such key phenomena in solid state physics as quantum tunnelling of atomic particles in solid state, cooperative properties of the system of local centers with internal degrees of freedom, and ferroelectricity.

Reaction before the recognition In February 2008, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry released the following statement: \\"We understand and support the legitimate aspirations of the Kosovars and the need for peace in Kosovo and the region. Pakistan is watching the developments in Kosovo carefully. We have noted the recognition extended by a number of important countries to the declaration of independence by the Kosovo Parliament and the statement made by the OIC Secretary General expressing happiness over this development, and solidarity and support with the Kosovars.

It remains our earnest desire that situation remains calm and peaceful in Kosovo and the region.\\"Declaration of Independence by Kosovo, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, 2008-02-19 At a meeting on 28 January 2009 between the Kosovan Foreign Minister, Sk√´nder Hyseni, and Mr. Shahbaz, Pakistan's Ambassador to Austria, the ambassador said that the people and Government of Pakistan support Kosovo on its path. He said that Pakistan is conducting intensive talks with its neighbours and other members of the OIC on the issue, and that it is just a matter of time before Pakistan makes the decision to recognise Kosovo or not. At a different meeting on 26 May 2009 between Hyseni and Hussain Haroon, the representative of Pakistan to the UN, Mr. Haroon stated that \\"we [Pakistan] definitively support your cause\\". In a 20 May 2010 conversation with the Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, Pakistani Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani said that \\"Pakistan was keenly observing the current situation\\" in Kosovo, and that it would wait for the ICJ's opinion before making a decision. In April 2011, a Pakistani Foreign Office official stated that \\"Islamabad is willing to recognise the Kosovo Republic, but the situation in Balochistan does not allow us to do so\\". He stated that Pakistan \\"is being pressed by several Muslim states and the United States to recognise the republic.\\" In addition, the Kosovar people, who had been supported by the United States in their freedom struggle against Serbian occupation, \\"are also eagerly awaiting recognition by Pakistan\\". The official said that \\"we are sorry we can't do so [recognise Kosovo]\\". \\"Pakistan finds it impossible to translate its desire into a reality.\\" On 13 April 2011, Israr Hussain the Director for Europe at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan stated that the issue of Kosovo's recognition by Pakistan will be discussed very soon and that it is a priority for the Government of Islamabad.  Recognition and aftermath  On 13 December 2011, then Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremiƒá said, during a visit to Pakistan, that Pakistan supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia and does not support the independence of Kosovo. However, on 21 December 2012, it was reported that Pakistan recognised Kosovo. On 24 December 2012 the Government of Pakistan announced their recognition of the Republic of Kosovo. Simultaneously, they established diplomatic relations with Pakistan's Ambassador to the Republic of Turkey in Ankara, being accredited to the Republic of Kosovo as non-resident Ambassador. In late October 2013 during a meeting in London between Kosovar President Atifete Jahjaga and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif it was agreed to boost economic trade between the two countries and avoid double taxation on goods. Each leader was invited and to one another's country for a state visit, and both leaders accepted the invitation.

Marriage with Chu In 523 BC, Duke Ai betrothed a Qin princess, possibly his daughter, to Crown Prince Jian of the State of Chu, Qin's ally. Prince Jian's father, King Ping of Chu, sent the minister Fei Wuji to escort the princess to Chu. However, Fei Wuji saw that the princess was beautiful and persuaded King Ping to take her as his own wife. Prince Jian fled abroad and was later killed.

Duke Ai sent generals Zipu (Â≠êËí≤) and Zihu (Â≠êËôé) with 500 chariots to Chu. In 505 BC the joint Qin-Chu forces defeated Wu in a series of battles, and King Hel√º was forced to retreat to Wu, and King Zhao returned to Chu. Death and succession In 501 BC Duke Ai died after 36 years of reign. His son predeceased him and was given the posthumous title Duke Yi (Áß¶Â§∑ÂÖ¨). Duke Ai was succeeded by Duke Yi's son, his grandson Duke Hui I of Qin.

She is primarily associated with nude and grotesque dances. Life and work Gertrud Leistikow was born on 12 September 1885 in B√ºckeburg, Lower Saxony. She attended girls' schools in Metz and Spa, and studied graphic design and painting in the class of Max Frey at the Academy of Applied Arts in Dresden,Jacoba Adriana de Boer, Gertrud Leistikow en de moderne, ‚ÄûDuitsche‚Äú dans. Een biografie. FGw: Amsterdam School for Culture and History (ASCH), Amsterdam, (2015) pp. 28 (full text online) where in 1904 she experienced a performance of √âmile Jaques-Dalcroze. She learned the basics of the Delsarte system from Hedwig Kallmeyer in Berlin. Leistikow began to dance between 1906 and 1910. Drawings by Dora Brandenburg-Polster in 1911 show her as a nude dancer. In 1914 Leistikow's solo performances already drew considerable crowds in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Lausanne, Utrecht and Sarajevo. In the summer of 1914 Leistikow joined Rudolf von Laban's troupe in Ascona, where in addition to Mary Wigman she had a major role in Laban's dance drama \\"triumph of the victim\\" by Hans Brandenburg. In 1916 she starred in a tour through Germany and the Netherlands. After her marriage to a Dutch flower dealer, she rarely left Holland. Leistikow directed three dance schools in Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam. A trip to the Dutch East India caused them to open three more schools in 1924. In 1931 she set up the Rotterdam School of Dance with the Dutch dancer and teacher Corrie Hartong, who was 21 years younger. The two disagreed over objectives, and after three years Leistikow left. She gave farewell tours through the Netherlands in the years 1929, 1930 and 1937. Nevertheless, she again toured from 1938 to 1939 in the Dutch East Indies. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Leistikow returned to the Netherlands and opened another dance school. She distanced herself from the Nazi-friendly Dutch dance culture of the time. Gertrud Leistikow kept her face expressionless, and often hid it behind scarves, veils and masks to draw the attention of the viewer to the rest of her body. Drawings and photographs often show Leistikow naked, but with her face covered. A dance photo of Leistikow on gelatin silver chloride made in 1912 by the photographer Hugo Erfurth has been exhibited since 1982 at the Folkwang Museum. Leistikow died on 23 November 1948.

This article addresses the history of transgender people in the United States from prior to western contact until the present. European transgender people have been present in the land now known as the United States at least since the early 1600s. Before Western contact, some Native American tribes had third gender people whose social roles varied from tribe to tribe. People dressing and living differently from their sex assignment at birth and contributing to various aspects of American history and culture have been documented from the 17th century to the present day. In the 20th and 21st centuries, advances in sex reassignment surgery as well as transgender activism have influenced transgender life and the popular perception of transgender people in the United States. Overview =Prior to 1800= Anthropologist George Catlin's painting, \\"Dance to the Berdache\\"[sic]. Circa 1861-1869, among the Sac and Fox Nations. Catlin's writings about gay and gender-variant Indigenous peoples were not flattering. Some Native American Nations have longstanding names and roles for gender-variant or third-gender people. These roles only tend to exist in cultures that have rigid gender roles, which is usually only seen in patriachal communities. The term two-spirit, which is now retroactively used to describe these historical roles, was only created in 1990 at the Indigenous lesbian and gay international gathering in Winnipeg, and \\"specifically chosen to distinguish and distance Native American/First Nations people from non- Native peoples.\\" The primary purpose of coining a new term was to encourage the replacement of the outdated and considered offensive, anthropological term, berdache, which appears in anthropological accounts. While this new term has not been universally accepted‚Äîit has been criticized by traditional communities who already have their own terms for the people being grouped under this new term, and by those who reject what they call the \\"western\\" binary implications, such as implying that Natives believe these individuals are \\"both male and female\\"‚Äîit has generally received more acceptance and use than the anthropological term it replaced. One of the first documented inhabitants of the American colonies to challenge binary gender roles was Thomas(ine) Hall, a servant who, in the 1620s, alternately dressed in both men's and women's clothing. Hall is likely to have been intersex, and was ordered by the Virginia court to wear both a man's breeches and a woman's apron and cap at the same time.Genny Beemyn, \\"Transgender History in the United States\\", from Trans Bodies, Trans Selves, edited by Laura Erickson- Schroth, Oxford University, 2014, p.1 Ellen Hartigan-O'Connor, Lisa G. Materson, The Oxford Handbook of American Women's and Gender History (2018, ), pages 315-316 Portrait of the Public Universal Friend from 1821. Lithogram of Mary Jones drawn by H.R. Robinson in 1836. In 1776, the Public Universal Friend reported being genderless (neither male nor female), dressed androgynously, and asked the followers they gained while preaching throughout New England over the next four decades not to refer to them by their birth name or gendered pronouns..Susan Juster, Lisa MacFarlane, A Mighty Baptism: Race, Gender, and the Creation of American Protestantism (1996, ), pp. 27-28; and Susan Juster, \\"Neither male nor female\\", in Possible Pasts: Becoming Colonial in Early America, pp. 362-363.Douglas L. Winiarski, Darkness Falls on the Land of Light (2017, ), p. 430. Some scholars have viewed them as outside the gender binary, and as a chapter in trans history \\"before [the word] 'transgender'\\".Scott Larson, \\"Indescribable Being\\": Theological Performances of Genderlessness in the Society of the Publick Universal Friend, 1776‚Äì1819, Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal (University of Pennsylvania Press), volume 12, number 3, Fall 2014, pp. 576-600.Rachel Hope Cleves, Beyond the Binaries in Early America: Special Issue Introduction, Early American Studies 12.3 (2014), pp. 459-468.The Routledge History of Queer America, edited by Don Romesburg (2018, ), esp. ¬ß \\"Revolution's End\\". Generally, according to Genny Beemyn in a Transgender History of the United States, the few historical accounts of transgender people that exist in early American history are of female to male transgender people, possibly because it was more difficult for male to female people to successfully present as women before the advent of sex-reassignment surgery and hormone treatments. One example she cites is Mary Henly, a female-assigned individual in Massachusetts who was charged with illegally wearing men's clothing in 1692 because it was \\"seeming to confound the course of nature.\\"Genny Beemyn, \\"Transgender History in the United States\\", from Trans Bodies, Trans Selves, edited by Laura Erickson-Schroth, Oxford University, 2014, p.4 =1800‚Äì1950= Joseph Lobdell (born in 1829 as Lucy Ann Lobdell), lived as a man for sixty years and due to this was arrested and incarcerated in an insane asylum. He was, however, able to marry a woman. Mary Jones (born in 1803 as Peter Sewally), a free African- American, was arrested in New York City in 1836 for dressing as a woman, prostitution, and pickpocketing. According to a contemporary report in the New York World, Jones appeared in court \\"attired a la mode de New York, elegantly, and in perfect style. Her or his dingy ears were decked with a pair of snow white ear rings, his head was ornamented with a wig of beautiful curly locks, and on it was a gilded comb, which was half hid amid the luxuriant crop of wool.\\" When asked about the dress, Jones replied, \\"I have been in the practice of waiting upon Girls of ill fame ... and they induced me to dress in Women‚Äôs Clothes, saying I looked so much better in them and I have always attended parties among the people of my own Colour dressed in this way ‚Äì and in New Orleans I always dressed in this way.\\" Jones was sentenced to five years in prison for grand larceny. A lithograph titled \\"The Man-Monster\\", showing Jones in female clothing, was published shortly afterwards. Jones was arrested again in 1845 and in 1845, both times dressed as a woman. 212x212px During the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) at least 240 people who were assigned female at birth are known to have worn men's clothing and fought as soldiers. Many may have done so because they weren't allowed to fight as women and this was their means of participating in the war effort. Some were transgender and continued to live as men throughout their lives. One such notable soldier was Albert Cashier. After the war, Frances Thompson (a formerly enslaved black trans woman) was one of five black women who testified before Congress's investigation of the Memphis Riots of 1866, during which a mob of white terrorists attacked and raped Thompson; ten years later, Thompson was arrested for \\"being a man dressed in women's clothing\\".Rosen, Hannah. Terror in the Heart of Freedom : Citizenship, Sexual Violence, and the Meaning of Race in the Postemancipation South. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2009. Accessed December 20, 2017.Ellen Hartigan-O'Connor, Lisa G. Materson, The Oxford Handbook of American Women's and Gender History (2018, ). In 1895 a group of self-described androgynes in New York organized a club called the Cercle Hermaphroditos, based on their wish \\"to unite for defense against the world's bitter persecution\\". Jennie June (born in 1874 as Earl Lind), a member of the Cercle Hermaphroditos, wrote The Autobiography of an Androgyne (1918) and The Female Impersonators (1922), memoirs that provide rare first-person testimony about the early-20th-century life of a transgender person. The words \\"transsexual\\" and \\"transgender\\" had not yet been coined, and June described herself as a \\"fairie\\" or \\"androgyne\\", an individual, she said, \\"with male genitals\\", but whose \\"physical constitution\\" and sexual life \\"approach the female type\\". In 2010 five sections of her third volume of memoirs (dated 1921 but never published), previously lost, were discovered and published on OutHistory.org. Murray Hall (1841-1901) was a politician in New York City for almost twenty-five years. After Hall's death, it was discovered that he had been assigned female at birth. Hall had been married twice and had an adopted daughter. Although his most recent wife had predeceased him, his daughter was described as \\"terribly shocked. She said she always believed her foster father was a man, and never heard her foster mother say anything that would lead her to suspect otherwise.\\" In 1917, Dr. Alan L. Hart, working with psychiatrist Dr. Joshua Gilbert, was the first documented trans man in the United States to undergo hysterectomy and gonadectomy, in order to live his life as a man.Brian Booth, Alberta Lucille Hart / Dr. Alan L. Hart: An Oregon \\"Pioneer\\", Oregon Cultural Heritage Commission 2000, retrieved October 31, 2016 Following his transition, Hart told The Albany Daily Democrat that he was \\"happier since I made this change than I ever have been in my life, and I will continue this way as long as I live [...] I have never concealed anything regarding my [change] to men's clothing [...] I came home to show my friends that I am ashamed of nothing.\\" Trans woman Lucy Hicks Anderson was born in 1886 in Waddy, Kentucky. She served as a domestic worker in her teen years, eventually becoming a socialite and madame in Oxnard, California during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1945, she was tried in Ventura County for perjury and fraud for receiving spousal allotments from the military, as her dressing and presenting as a woman was considered masquerading. She lost the case, but avoided a lengthy jail sentence, only to be tried again by the federal government shortly thereafter. She also lost this case, and was sentenced to jail time, along with her then husband Ruben Anderson. After serving their sentences, they relocated to Los Angeles, where they lived quietly until her death in 1954. Billy Tipton (born in 1914 as Dorothy Lucille Tipton) was a notable American jazz musician and bandleader who lived as a man in all aspects of his life from the 1940s until his death. His own son did not know of his past until Tipton's death. The first newspaper article about Tipton was published the day after his funeral and was quickly picked up by wire services. Stories about Tipton appeared in a variety of papers including tabloids such as the National Enquirer and Star, as well as more reputable papers such as New York Magazine and The Seattle Times. Tipton's family also made talk show appearances. =1950s and 1960s= The 1953 film Glen or Glenda dealt with transsexuality and transvestism. The 1950s and 1960s saw some of the first transgender organizations and publications, but law and medicine did not respond favorably to growing awareness of transgender people. The most famous American transgender person of the time was Christine Jorgensen, who in 1952 became the first widely publicized person to have undergone sex reassignment surgery, (in this case, male to female), creating a worldwide sensation. However, she was denied a marriage license in 1959 when she attempted to marry a man, and her fiance lost his job when his engagement to Christine became public knowledge.Staff report (April 4, 1959). Bars Marriage Permit; Clerk Rejects Proof of Sex of Christine Jorgensen. New York Times Virginia Prince, a transgender person who began living full-time as a woman in San Francisco in the 1940s, developed a widespread correspondence network with transgender people throughout Europe and the United States by the 1950s. She worked closely with Alfred Kinsey to bring the needs of transgender people to the attention of social scientists and sex reformers. In 1952, using Virginia Prince's correspondence network for its initial subscription list, a handful of other transgender people in Southern California launched Transvestia: The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress, which published two issues. The Society that launched the journal also only briefly existed in Southern California. The Cooper Donuts Riot was a May 1959 incident in Los Angeles, in which transgender women, lesbian women, drag queens, and gay men rioted, one of the first LGBT uprisings in the US. The incident was sparked by police harassment of LGBT people at a 24-hour cafe called \\"Cooper Donuts\\". In 1960 Virginia Prince began another publication, also called Transvestia, that discussed transgender concerns. In 1962, she founded the Hose and Heels Club for cross-dressers, which soon changed its name to Phi Pi Epsilon, a name designed to evoke Greek-letter sororities and to play on the initials FPE, the acronym for Prince's philosophy of \\"Full Personality Expression\\". Prince believed that the binary gender system harmed both men and women by keeping them from their full human potential, and she considered cross-dressing to be one means of fixing this. Reed Erickson, a transsexual man, founded the Erickson Educational Foundation in 1964. EEF supplied information at no cost to transgender people, family members, and professionals and provided funding for the publication of Richard Green and John Money's edited 1969 text Transsexualism and Sex Reassignment and other books about sex and gender. EEF also funded the earliest symposia for professionals who worked with transsexuals; this eventually resulted in the formation of the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association, which is today called the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. The work of the EEF would be continued by psychologist Paul Walker in the late 1970s, in the 1980s by Sister Mary Elizabeth Clark and Jude Patton, and in the 1990s by Dallas Denny. In the late 1960s in New York, Mario Martino founded the Labyrinth Foundation Counseling Service, which was the first transgender community-based organization that specifically addressed the needs of transsexual men. Holly Woodlawn, Andy Warhol superstar, in 2007 Transgender people also gained some exposure through popular culture, in particular the work of Andy Warhol. In the 1960s and early 1970s the transgender actresses Holly Woodlawn and Candy Darling were among Warhol's Warhol Superstars, appearing in several of his films. The 1953 film Glen or Glenda explored transsexuality and transvestism; though it got bad reviews, it later became a cult classic.Craig, Rob (2009), \\"Glen or Glenda? (1953)\\", Ed Wood, Mad Genius: A Critical Study of the Films, McFarland & Company, It was loosely inspired by the sex reassignment surgery of Christine Jorgensen; posters for the film, also known as I Changed My Sex and I Led Two Lives, publicize the movie as being based on her. In 1968, Gore Vidal wrote the first American novel in which the lead character undergoes sex reassignment surgery, Myra Breckinridge, which was later made into a film.Altman, Dennis. Gore Vidal's America. Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, 2005 On April 25, 1965 over 150 people were denied service at Dewey's, a local coffee shop and diner at 219 South 17th Street in Philadelphia, near Rittenhouse Square. Those denied service were variously described at the time as \\"homosexuals,\\" \\"masculine women,\\" \\"feminine men,\\" and \\"persons wearing non- conformist clothing.\\" Three teenagers (reported by the Janus Society and Drum to be two males and one female) staged a sit-in that day. After restaurant managers contacted police, the three were arrested. In the process of offering legal support for the teens, local activist and president of the homophile organization the Janus Society, Clark Polak, was also arrested. Demonstrations took place outside the establishment over the next five days with 1500 flyers being distributed by the Janus Society and its supporters. Three people staged a second sit-in on May 2, 1965. The police were again called, but refused to make arrests this time. The Janus Society said the protests were successful in preventing further arrests and the action was deemed \\"the first sit-in of its kind in the history of the United States\\" by Drum magazine. Gene Compton's Cafeteria Riot 40th Anniversary Historical Marker at corner of Taylor and Turk in San Francisco The following year, in 1966, one of the first recorded transgender riots in US history took place. The Compton's Cafeteria Riot occurred in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco. The night after the riot, more transgender people, hustlers, Tenderloin street people, and other members of the LGBT community joined in a picket of the cafeteria, which would not allow transgender people back in. The demonstration ended with the newly installed plate-glass windows being smashed again. The riot marked the beginning of transgender activism in San Francisco.Boyd, Nan Alamilla (2004). \\"San Francisco\\" in the Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered History in America, Ed. Marc Stein. Vol. 3. Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 71‚Äì78. According to the online encyclopedia glbtq.com, \\"In the aftermath of the riot at Compton's, a network of transgender social, psychological, and medical support services was established, which culminated in 1968 with the creation of the National Transsexual Counseling Unit [NTCU], the first such peer-run support and advocacy organization in the world\\". Some people who later went on to be involved in transgender activism were involved in the Stonewall Riots of 1969 at the Stonewall Inn in New York. This week- long violent uprising in the gay bars and streets of Greenwich Village is widely considered to be a turning point in for the LGBT rights movement in America, as it marked the transition from the more assimilationist, respectability politics of groups like the Mattachine Society and Daughters of Bilitis to the birth of the radical, Gay liberation movement and the founding of groups like the Gay Liberation Front, with its Drag Queen Caucus, members of whom later founded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries and the Queens Liberation Front. Gender-nonconforming and trans activists including Marsha P. Johnson, Zazu Nova and Jackie Hormona were confirmed to be \\"in the vanguard\\" of the rioting on the first night. =1970s and 1980s= Many support organizations for male cross-dressers began in the 1970s and 1980s, with most beginning as offshoots of Virginia Prince's organizations from the early 1960s. Transgender activist Lee Brewster, of the Queens Liberation Front began publishing the transgender women's magazine Queens. Angela Douglas founded TAO (Transsexual/Transvestite Action Organization), which published the Moonshadow and Mirage newsletters. TAO moved to Miami in 1972, where it came to include several Puerto Rican and Cuban members, and soon grew into the first international transgender community organization. Another significant event for activism occurred in 1979, with the first National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights held in Washington, D.C. on October 14. It drew between 75,000 and 125,000Ghaziani, Amin. 2008. \\"The Dividends of Dissent: How Conflict and Culture Work in Lesbian and Gay Marches on Washington\\". The University of Chicago Press. transgender people, lesbians, bisexual people, gay men, and straight allies to demand equal civil rights and urge the passage of protective civil rights legislation. The march was organized by Phyllis Frye (who in 2010 became Texas's first openly transgender judge) and three other activists, but no transgender people spoke at the main rally. Sandy Stone, as transgender engineer of Olivia Records, was targeted in the 1970s; she has been cited as the originator of Transgender Studies. The 1970s also saw conflict between the transgender and lesbian communities in America. A dispute began in 1973, when the West Coast Lesbian Conference split over a scheduled performance by the lesbian transgender folk-singer Beth Elliott. Elliott had served as vice-president of the San Francisco chapter of the lesbian group Daughters of Bilitis, and edited the chapter's newsletter, Sisters, but was expelled from the group in 1973 on the grounds that she was not really a woman. In 1977 some lesbians protested the fact that lesbian transgender woman Sandy Stone was employed at Olivia Records. In 1979 lesbian radical feminist activist Janice Raymond released the book The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male, which she framed as a critique of a patriarchal medical and psychiatric establishment, and which maintains that transsexualism is based on the \\"patriarchal myths\\" of \\"male mothering\\", and \\"making of woman according to man's image\\". Raymond claimed this was done in order \\"to colonize feminist identification, culture, politics and sexuality\\", adding: \\"All transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves .... Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive.\\" In this charge, Raymond echoed feminist Robin Morgan's charge at the 1973 West Coast Lesbian Conference, held in Los Angeles, that pre-op transsexual folk singer Beth Elliott, who had performed the previous day, was \\"an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a destroyer-with the mentality of a rapist.\\"Robin Morgan, \\"Keynote Address\\" Lesbian Tide. May/Jun73, Vol. 2 Issue 10/11, p30‚Äì34 (quote p 32). In particular, Raymond mounted an ad hominem attack on Sandy Stone in The Transsexual Empire.Raymond, Janice (1979). The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male. Teachers College Press, Raymond accused Stone by name of plotting to destroy the Olivia Records collective and womanhood in general with \\"male energy\\". In 1976, prior to publication, Raymond had sent a draft of the chapter attacking Stone to the Olivia collective \\"for comment\\", apparently in anticipation of outing Stone. Raymond appeared unaware that Stone had informed the collective of her transgender status before agreeing to join. The collective did return comments to Raymond, suggesting that her description of transgender people and of Stone's place in and effect on the collective was at odds with the reality of the collective's interaction with Stone. Raymond responded by increasing the virulence of her attack on Stone in the published version of the manuscript: > Masculine behavior is notably obtrusive. It is significant that > transsexually constructed lesbian feminists have inserted themselves into > positions of importance and/or performance in the feminist community.

As one woman wrote: > \\"I feel raped when Olivia passes off Sandy...as a real woman. After all his > male privilege, is he going to cash in on lesbian feminist culture too?\\" The collective responded in turn by publicly defending Stone in various feminist publications of the time. Stone continued as a member of the collective and continued to record Olivia artists until political dissension over her transgender status, exacerbated by Janice's book, culminated in 1979 in the threat of a boycott of Olivia products. After long debate, Stone left the collective and returned to Santa Cruz. By the late 1970s, despite increasing recognition in medical circles, the battle for acceptance was far from won and some of the reverses of this period included the dissolution of some of the first transsexual advocacy groups including the NTCU, and the loss of support in both gay and feminist circles. In 1980, transgender people were officially classified by the American Psychiatric Association as having \\"gender identity disorder.\\" The 1980s saw the founding of a number of newsletters and magazines of central importance to trans people. In the 1980s, most of the subscribers to Rupert Raj's Toronto-based publications, Metamorphosis and Gender NetWorker, were Americans. Metamorphosis was founded by Raj in early 1982 as a bi-monthly newsletter. It was a \\"newsletter exclusively for F-M men\\" (with an intended readership among their families, wives/girlfriends, as well as professionals and \\"para professionals interested in female TSism\\"). By the third issue, the newsletter averaged around 8 pages, whereas in 1986, most issues were 24 pages; the last issue was in 1988. In 1986 transgender activist Lou Sullivan founded the support group that grew into FTM International, the leading advocacy group for transgender men, and began publishing The FTM Newsletter. Gender NetWorker was founded by Raj in 1988, and lasted two issues. This publication was directed specifically towards \\"helping professionals and resource providers.\\"Finding Aid, Rupert Raj Collection, Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives, Toronto ON Canada The term \\"transgender\\" as an umbrella term to refer to all gender non-conforming people became more commonplace in the late 1980s. In 1987 Sandy Stone, an American transgender woman, published the essay \\"The Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto,\\" in response to the anti-transsexual book The Transsexual Empire. Her essay has been cited as the origin of transgender studies. =1990s and 2000s= In 1991 a transgender woman named Nancy Burkholder was removed from the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival when security guards realized she was transgender. After that there were demonstrations against the Festival's women-born-women only policy. These demonstrations were known as Camp Trans. The final Michigan Womyn's Music Festival was held in 2015. 1991 was also the year of the first Southern Comfort Conference, a major transgender conference that takes place annually in Atlanta, Georgia.Eleanor J. Brader, \\"Trans Health Care Reform: It's About Life and Death.\\" Conducive August/September 2009. It is the largest, most famous, and pre-eminent such conference in the United States. Several transgender organizations were founded in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 1991, Dallas Denny launched the 501(c)(3) nonprofit American Educational Gender Information Service, which provided information and referrals to trans people, their families, and the press, and published the respected journal Chrysalis Quarterly. Transgender Nation, an offshoot of Queer Nation's San Francisco chapter, was one of the early transgender organizations, lasting from 1992 to 1994. Transexual Menace (sic) was another such group, founded in 1994 by Riki Wilchins. One of its first actions was to hold a memorial vigil outside at the trial of Brandon Teena's killers. In 1995, all the national transgender organizations got together and formed the board of GenderPAC, the first national political advocacy organization devoted to the right to one's gender identity. GenderPAC organized the first National Gender Lobby Day on Capitol Hill the following year, with help from activists Phyllis Frye and Jane Fee. It also launched a Corporate Diversity Pledge of Fortune 500 companies that had added \\"gender identity\\" to their non-discrimination policies (since HRC's at that point was only \\"sexual orientation\\") as well as a similar Congressional Diversity Pledge. However, GenderPAC saw its focus as also including gender non- conforming gays and lesbians who were discriminated against, causing a split in the organization. In 1999 the National Transgender Advocacy Coalition was founded by a group of experienced transgender lobbyists. The Transgender Foundation of America was founded in 2001. In 2003 the National Center for Transgender Equality and the Transgender American Veterans Association (TAVA) were founded. Parents of transgender children became active in the 2000s The LGBT rights group Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), founded in 1972, also became more supportive of transgender people at this time. In 1998 gender identity was added to their mission after a vote at their annual meeting in San Francisco. PFLAG was the first national LGBT organization to officially adopt a transgender-inclusion policy for its work. PFLAG established its Transgender Network, also known as TNET, in 2002, as its first official \\"Special Affiliate,\\" recognized with the same privileges and responsibilities as its regular chapters. At this time the transgender community became more visible. A high school teacher in Lake Forest, IL, Karen Kopriva, became the first American teacher to transition on the job in 1998. There was considerable media uproar, but when another teacher followed the next year in a different suburb hardly anyone noticed. The Transgender Day of Remembrance was founded in 1998 by Gwendolyn Ann Smith, an American transgender graphic designer, columnist, and activist,Smith, G. (2010). Biography. Retrieved from to memorialize the murder of transgender woman Rita Hester in Massachusetts in 1998. The Transgender Day of Remembrance is held every year on November 20 and now memorializes all those murdered due to transphobic hate and prejudice. The most prominent version of the Transgender Pride flag was created in 1999 by the American trans woman Monica Helms.Gay and Lesbian Times. Brian van de Mark, May 10, 2007 The flag was first shown at a pride parade in Phoenix, Arizona in 2000. In 2012 Spokane Trans created their own version of the transgender pride flag. They describe it on their web site as follows: \\"The top two stripes represent male (blue) to female (pink). The purple represents non-binary and genderqueer people (as the genderqueer flag colors are green, white and purple) the thin white stripe represents all people as well as the \\"line\\" trans* folks cross during their transition. Then the female (pink) to male (blue) along the bottom.\\" In 2009 the International Transgender Day of Visibility was founded by Rachel Crandall, also the founder of TransGender Michigan; it is an annual holiday occurring on March 31, dedicated to celebrating transgender people and raising awareness of discrimination faced by transgender people worldwide. Transgender visibility in the LGBT community also gathered force in the 2000s. In 2002, Pete Chvany, Luigi Ferrer, James Green, Loraine Hutchins and Monica McLemore presented at the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Intersex Health Summit, held in Boulder, Colorado, marking the first time transgender people, bisexual people, and intersex people were recognized as co-equal partners on the national level rather than gay and lesbian \\"allies\\" or tokens. In 2004 the San Francisco Trans March was first held. It has been held annually since; it is San Francisco's largest transgender Pride event and one of the largest trans events in the entire world. Also in 2004 the book The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism by the highly controversial researcher J. Michael Bailey was announced as a finalist in the Transgender category of the 2003 Lambda Literary Awards. Transgender people immediately protested the nomination and gathered thousands of petition signatures in opposition within a few days. After the petition, the Foundation's judges examined the book more closely, decided that they considered it transphobic and removed it from their list of finalists. Within a year the executive director who had initially approved of the book's inclusion resigned. Executive director Charles Flowers later stated that \\"the Bailey incident revealed flaws in our awards nomination process, which I have completely overhauled since becoming the foundation's executive director in January 2006.\\"Flowers, Charles (September 20, 2007). Letter to the New York Times, Sept 20, 2007. In 2005 transgender activist Pauline Park became the first openly transgender person chosen to be grand marshal of the New York City Pride March, the oldest and largest LGBT pride event in the United States. Police chief Heather Fong, Theresa Sparks, and Stephan Thorne, first Transgender San Francisco police officer Politics increasingly began to include openly transgender people. In 2003 Theresa Sparks was the first openly transgender woman ever named \\"Woman of the Year\\" by the California State Assembly, and in 2007 she was elected president of the San Francisco Police Commission by a single vote, making her the first openly transgender person ever to be elected president of any San Francisco commission, as well as San Francisco's highest ranking openly transgender official.SF Police Commission Makes History, KCBS (May 10, 2007).

(Retrieved on Januari 7, 2011) In 2006 Kim Coco Iwamoto was elected as a member of the Hawaii Board of Education, making her at that time the highest ranking openly transgender elected official in the United States, as well as the first openly transgender official to win statewide office. In 2008 Stu Rasmussen became the first openly transgender mayor in America (in Silverton, Oregon). In 2009 Diego Sanchez became the first openly transgender person to work on Capitol Hill, where he worked as a legislative assistant for Barney Frank. Sanchez was also the first transgender person on the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) Platform Committee in 2008. In 2009 Barbra \\"Babs\\" Siperstein was nominated and confirmed as the first openly transgender at- large member of the Democratic National Committee, and in 2012 she became the first elected openly transgender member of the DNC. Transgender history also began to be recognized around this time. In 1996 Leslie Feinberg published Transgender Warriors, a history of transgender people. Dallas Denny founded the Transgender Historical Society in 1995 and in 2000 donated her collection of historical materials to the Joseph A. Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan. In 2008 Cristan Williams donated her personal collection to the Transgender Foundation of America, where it became the first collection in the Transgender Archive, an archive of transgender history worldwide. In 2009 the Committee on Lesbian and Gay History, an affiliated society of the American Historical Association, changed its name to the Committee on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender History. Transgender people also made groundbreaking strides in entertainment. In 2001 Jessica Crockett became the first transgender female actress to play a transgender character on television, on James Cameron's TV series Dark Angel. In 2004, the first all-transgender performance of the Vagina Monologues was held. The monologues were read by eighteen notable transgender women, and a new monologue revolving around the experiences and struggles of transgender women was included. In 2005 Alexandra Billings became the second openly transgender woman to have played a transgender character on television, which she did in the made-for-TV movie Romy and Michelle: A New Beginning. From 2007 to 2008 actress Candis Cayne played Carmelita Rainer, a transgender woman having an affair with married New York Attorney General Patrick Darling (played by William Baldwin), on the ABC prime time drama Dirty Sexy Money. The role made Cayne the first openly transgender actress to play a recurring transgender character in prime time. The American transgender community also achieved some firsts in religion around this time. In 2002 at the Reform Jewish seminary Hebrew Union College- Jewish Institute of Religion in New York the Reform rabbi Margaret Wenig organized the first school-wide seminar at any rabbinical school which addressed the psychological, legal, and religious issues affecting people who are transsexual or intersex. In 2003 she organized the first school-wide seminar at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College which addressed the psychological, legal, and religious issues affecting people who are transsexual or intersex. Also in 2003, Reuben Zellman became the first openly transgender person accepted to the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, where he was ordained in 2010. Elliot Kukla, who came out as transgender six months before his ordination in 2006, was the first openly transgender person to be ordained by the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. HUC-JIR is the oldest extant Jewish seminary in the Americas and the main seminary for training rabbis, cantors, educators, and communal workers in Reform Judaism. In 2007 Joy Ladin became the first openly transgender professor at an Orthodox Jewish institution (Stern College for Women of Yeshiva University). Emily Aviva Kapor was ordained privately by a rabbi she defined as \\"Conservadox\\" in 2005, but did not begin living as a woman until 2012, thus becoming the first openly transgender female rabbi. =2010s and 2020s= Chaz Bono appeared on Dancing with the Stars in 2011 In the 2010s openly transgender people became increasingly prominent in entertainment. Chaz Bono became a highly visible transgender celebrity when he appeared on the 13th season of the US version of Dancing with the Stars in 2011, which was the first time an openly transgender man starred on a major network television show for something unrelated to being transgender. He also made Becoming Chaz, a documentary about his gender transition that premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. OWN (the Oprah Winfrey Network) acquired the rights to the documentary and debuted it on May 10, 2011. Also in 2011, Harmony Santana became the first openly transgender actress to receive a major acting award nomination when she was nominated by the Independent Spirit Awards as Best Supporting Actress for the movie Gun Hill Road. In 2012, Bring It On: The Musical premiered on Broadway, and it featured the first transgender teenage character ever in a Broadway show - La Cienega, a transgender woman played by actor Gregory Haney. That same year singer Tom Gabel made headlines when she publicly came out as transgender, planning to begin medical transition and eventually take the name Laura Jane Grace. She is the first major rock star to come out as transgender. Director Lana Wachowski, formerly known as Larry Wachowski, came out as transgender in 2012 while doing publicity for her movie Cloud Atlas. This made her the first major Hollywood director to come out as transgender. In the 2010s transgender people also made more inroads in politics. In 2010 Amanda Simpson became the first openly transgender presidential appointee in America when she was appointed as senior technical adviser in the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security. Also in 2010, Victoria Kolakowski became the first openly transgender judge in America. In 2012 Stacie Laughton became the first openly transgender person elected as a state legislator in United States history. However, she resigned before she was sworn in and was never seated. It was revealed that she was a convicted felon and was still on probation, having served four months in Belknap County House of Corrections following a 2008 credit card fraud conviction. It was later determined that she was ineligible to serve in the New Hampshire State Legislature. Previously, in 1992 Althea Garrison had been elected as a state legislator, serving one term in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, but it was not publicly known she was transgender when she was elected. In 2017, Danica Roem was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates. She became the first openly transgender person to both be elected to a U.S. state's legislature and serve her term.Althea Garrison served a term in the Massachusetts House of Representatives after being outed, but subsequent to winning her election in 1992. Stacie Laughton was elected in 2012 to the New Hampshire House of Representatives while openly transgender, but did not serve her term. Also in 2017, Tyler Titus, a transgender man, became the first openly transgender person elected to public office in Pennsylvania when he was elected to the Erie School Board. He and Phillipe Cunningham, elected to the Minneapolis City Council on the same night, became the first two openly trans men to be elected to public office in the United States.

LGBTQ activist and actress Laverne Cox at San Francisco Trans March 2015. In 2014 openly transgender people became more visible. That year Laverne Cox was on the cover of the June 9, 2014, issue of Time, and was interviewed for the article \\"The Transgender Tipping Point\\" by Katy Steinmetz, which ran in that issue and the title of which was also featured on the cover; this made Cox the first openly transgender person on the cover of Time. Later in 2014 Cox became the first openly transgender person to be nominated for an Emmy in an acting category: Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Sophia Burset in Orange Is the New Black. She did not win, however. Also that year Transgender Studies Quarterly, the first non-medical academic journal devoted to transgender issues, began publication with two openly transgender coeditors, Susan Stryker and Paisley Currah. Also in 2014 a wooden racket used by openly transgender tennis player Ren√©e Richards and the original transgender pride flag created by openly transgender activist and Navy veteran Monica Helms, as well as items from Helms's career in the service as a submariner, were donated to the National Museum of American History, which is part of the Smithsonian. But perhaps the most important change in 2014 was that Mills College became the first single-sex college in the U.S. to adopt a policy explicitly welcoming openly transgender students, followed by Mount Holyoke becoming the first Seven Sisters college to accept transgender students. In 2014, gay trans man Lou Cutler become the first transgender man to be crowned Mr. Gay Philadelphia. Following her divorce in 2015, Caitlyn Jenner came out in a television interview as a transgender woman. On June 1, 2015, Caitlyn Jenner (formerly Bruce Jenner) revealed her new name, Caitlyn, and her use of female pronouns officially. Many news sources have described Jenner as the most famous openly transgender American. As for political organizations fighting for LGBT rights, in 2012 Allyson Robinson, who graduated West Point as Daniel Robinson, was appointed as the first Executive Director of OutServe-SLDN, the association of LGBT people serving in the military, making her the first openly transgender person to lead a national LGBT organization that does not have an explicit transgender focus. 2012 also saw the country's first government-funded campaign to combat anti-transgender discrimination, held by the D.C. Office of Human Rights. There were also two firsts for transgender people in sports in the 2010s. Kye Allums became the first openly transgender athlete to play NCAA basketball in 2010. Allums is a transgender man who played on George Washington University's women's team. In 2012 Keelin Godsey became the first openly transgender contender for the U.S. Olympic team, but he failed to qualify and did not go to the Olympics. Three groups - the Girl Scouts, the North American Gay Amateur Athletic Alliance, and the Episcopal Church in the United States - announced their acceptance of transgender people in this decade. In 2011, after the initial rejection of Bobby Montoya, a transgender girl, from the Girl Scouts of Colorado, the Girl Scouts of Colorado announced that \\"Girl Scouts is an inclusive organization and we accept all girls in Kindergarten through 12th grade as members. If a child identifies as a girl and the child's family presents her as a girl, Girl Scouts of Colorado welcomes her as a Girl Scout.\\" Also in 2011, the North American Gay Amateur Athletic Alliance changed its policy to include transgender and bisexual players. In 2012 the Episcopal Church in the United States approved a change to their nondiscrimination canons to include gender identity and expression. Caitlyn Jenner appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair in 2015 Another significant change for transgender people occurred in 2013 when the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) was released. This edition eliminated the term \\"gender identity disorder,\\" which was considered stigmatizing, instead referring to \\"gender dysphoria\\", which focuses attention only on those who feel distressed by their gender identity. It was announced on June 30, 2016 that, beginning on that date, otherwise qualified United States service members could no longer be discharged, denied reenlistment, involuntarily separated, or denied continuation of service because of being transgender. However, on July 26, 2017, President Donald Trump announced that transgender people would not be allowed to \\"serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\\" Then on October 4 of that year, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in Jane Doe v. Trump (about the new policy) and to oppose the application for a preliminary injunction, arguing instead \\"that challenge is premature several times over\\" and that Secretary Mattis's Interim Guidance, issued on September 14, 2017, protected currently serving transgender personnel from involuntary discharge or denial of reenlistment. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly granted the plaintiffs' preliminary injunction on October 30, 2017. In the ruling, Judge Kollar-Kotelly noted the defendants' motion to dismiss the case was \\"perhaps compelling in the abstract, [but] wither[s] away under scrutiny.\\" The ruling effectively reinstated the policies established prior to President Trump's tweets announcing the reinstatement of the ban, namely the retention and accession policies for transgender personnel effective on June 30, 2017. Sarah McBride was a speaker at the Democratic National Convention in July 2016, becoming the first openly transgender person to address a major party convention in American history. In 2016 Lambda Literary foundation established an annual scholarship in honor of trans woman Bryn Kelly, a Lambda Literary Fellow who committed suicide in January 2016. She was the first male to female transgender Fellow. On January 30, 2017, the Boy Scouts of America announced that transgender boys would be allowed to enroll in boys-only programs, effective immediately. Previously, the sex listed on an applicant's birth certificate determined eligibility for these programs; going forward, the decision would be based on the gender listed on the application. In February 2017, Joe Maldonado became the first openly transgender member of the Boy Scouts of America; the Boy Scouts policy on transgender boys had been changed after Joe's rejection from them in 2016 for being transgender became nationally known. Also in 2017, the Trump administration, through the Department of Justice, reversed the Obama-era policy which used Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to protect transgender employees from discrimination. The Supreme Court ruled in June 2020 that Title VII includes protections for gay and transgender employees. Also in 2017, The Advocate named \\"Transgender Americans\\" as its \\"Person of the Year\\", and listed Danica Roem (a transgender woman) as a finalist. On June 14, 2020, the largest transgender-rights demonstration in LGBTQ history, the Brooklyn Liberation March, took place; it stretched from Grand Army Plaza to Fort Greene, Brooklyn, drawing an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 participants, and focused on supporting black trans lives. Bostock v. Clayton County, , was a landmark Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled (on June 15, 2020) that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees against discrimination because of their gender identity (or sexual orientation).Bostock v. Clayton County, .Supreme Court Ruling 2020-06-15 (pages 1 ‚Äì 33 in the linked document) A plaintiff in the case was Aimee Stephens, an openly transgender woman. Recent history by topic (1970s - present) =Education= Mount Holyoke became the first all women's college to accept openly transgender students in 2014 Sandy Stone is an openly transgender woman whose essay, titled \\"The Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto,\\" and published in 1987 in response to the anti- transsexual book Transsexual Empire, has been cited as the origin of transgender studies. In 2012 Campus Pride, founded in 2001, issued its first list of the most welcoming places for trans students to go to college. In 2014 Mills College became the first single-sex college in the U.S. to adopt a policy explicitly welcoming openly transgender students. The policy states that applicants not assigned to the female sex at birth but who self-identify as women are welcome, as are applicants who identify as neither male or female if they were assigned to the female sex at birth. It also states that students assigned to the female sex at birth who have legally become male prior to applying are not eligible unless they apply to the graduate program, which is coeducational, although female students who become male after enrolling may stay and graduate. Also in 2014 Mount Holyoke College became the first Seven Sisters college to accept openly transgender students. Also in 2014, Transgender Studies Quarterly, the first non-medical academic journal devoted to transgender issues, began publication, with two openly transgender coeditors, Susan Stryker and Paisley Currah. In 2015, Schools In Transition: A Guide for Supporting Transgender Students in K-12 Schools was introduced; it is a first-of-its-kind publication for school administrations, teachers, and parents about how to provide safe and supportive environments for all transgender students in kindergarten through twelfth grade. Its authors are the Transgender Youth Project Staff Attorney for the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), Gender Spectrum's Senior Director for Professional Development and Family Services, the National Education Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Human Rights Campaign. In 2016 guidance was issued by the Departments of Justice and Education stating that schools which receive federal money must treat a student‚Äôs gender identity as their sex (for example, in regard to bathrooms). However, this policy was revoked in 2017. In 2019, University of Tennessee graduate Hera Jay Brown became the first transgender woman to be selected for a Rhodes Scholarship. Two non-binary scholars were also selected for the 2020 class. =Employment= San Francisco city officials and activists met in 2007 to urge Congress to include transgender people in the Employment Non- Discrimination Act In 1971, Paula Grossman was fired from her 14-year position as an elementary music teacher in Bernards Township, New Jersey after coming out as transgender. She never returned to teaching and died in 2003. In August 2005, it was revealed that New Jersey public school teacher Mr. Herb McCaffrey had undergone gender-reassignment surgery in the middle of the previous school year and would return as Ms. Kerri Nicole McCaffrey, becoming the first openly transgender teacher in New Jersey in over thirty years. Because McCaffrey was non-tenured, she hid her identity until the end of that 2005 school year and only revealed her changed name and status publicly that summer. Despite controversy, McCaffrey kept her 5th grade teaching job. She still teaches in Mendham Boro, New Jersey as of 2015. In 2012, Kylar Broadus, founder of the Trans People of Color Coalition of Columbia, Missouri, spoke to the Senate in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. His speech was the first-ever Senate testimony from an openly transgender witness. The Obama administration announced on June 30, 2016 that, effective immediately, otherwise qualified United States service members could no longer be discharged, denied reenlistment, involuntarily separated, or denied continuation of service because of being transgender. This was reversed by President Donald Trump, who, in 2017, declared via Twitter that transgender individuals would not be allowed to \\"serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\\" This set off a long legal battle. Although several judges issued injunctions to delay Trump's proposal, the Supreme Court ultimately allowed the Trump administration to proceed with its plan. As of April 2019, existing transgender personnel may continue to serve, but new transgender personnel cannot join. In 2017, the Trump administration, through the Department of Justice, reversed the Obama- era policy which used Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to protect transgender employees from discrimination. Bostock v. Clayton County, , was a landmark Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled (on June 15, 2020) that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees against discrimination because of their gender identity (or sexual orientation). A plaintiff in the case was Aimee Stephens, an openly transgender woman. =Health= Trans activists Jazz Jennings and Abby Stein at the Philadelphia Trans Health Conference 2016 In 1980, transgender people were officially classified by the American Psychiatric Association as having \\"gender identity disorder.\\" In 2003, Dr. Marci Bowers, a gynecologic surgeon and transgender woman, joined the practice of Dr. Stanley Biber in Trinidad, Colorado, and is acknowledged as the first woman and first trans woman to perform many vaginoplasties. (Sheila Kirk, MD, another trans woman, performed fewer than 10 vaginoplasties earlier while at the University of Pittsburgh.) She now practices primarily in Burlingame, California, and initiated transgender surgical training programs for vaginoplasty in Tel Aviv, Israel at Sheba Hospital (2014), at Mt Sinai Icahn School of Medicine in New York (2016), at Denver Health (2016) and at Toronto/Women‚Äôs College Hospital (2019). Dr. Bowers also performed the first 2 \\"live vaginoplasties\\" at the WPATH.wpath.org/GEI courses at New York‚Äôs Mt. Sinai Hospital in 2018 and 2019. In February 2007, Norman Spack co-founded Boston Children's Hospital's Gender Management Service (GeMS) clinic; it is America's first clinic to treat transgender children.Transgender At 10. Wweek.com (August 6, 2014). Retrieved on 2015-04-26. In 2009, America's professional association of endocrinologists established best practices for transgender children that included prescribing puberty-suppressing drugs to preteens followed by hormone therapy beginning at about age 16. In 2012 the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry echoed these recommendations. In 2011, the Center of Excellence for Transgender Health published the first-ever protocols for transgender primary care. Also in 2011, the Veterans Health Administration issued a directive stipulating that all transgender and intersex veterans are entitled to the same level of care \\"without discrimination\\" as other veterans, consistent across all Veterans Administration healthcare facilities. In 2012, the American Psychiatric Association issued official position statements supporting the care and civil rights of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals. In 2013, the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) was released. This edition eliminated the term \\"gender identity disorder,\\" which was considered stigmatizing, instead referring to \\"gender dysphoria\\", which focuses attention only on those who feel distressed by their gender identity. Also in 2013, at the request of a panel of endocrinologists, U.S. News and World Report, for the first time in its hospital rankings, assigned additional points to hospitals that had programs designed to meet the needs of transgender youth. Willy Wilkinson, transgender writer and public health consultant, at San Francisco Trans March 2015 In 2015, the American Psychological Association's Council of Representatives adopted \\"Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People\\" at the Association's 123rd Annual Convention. Such guidelines set ideals to which the American Psychological Association encourages psychologists to aspire. According to the \\"Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People\\", psychologists who work with transgender or gender nonconforming people should seek to provide acceptance, support and understanding without making assumptions about their clients‚Äô gender identities or gender expressions. In 2017, the Defense Health Agency for the first time approved payment for sex reassignment surgery for an active-duty U.S. military service member. The patient, an infantry soldier who identifies as a woman, had already begun a course of treatment for gender reassignment. The procedure, which the treating doctor deemed medically necessary, was performed on November 14 at a private hospital, since military hospitals lack the requisite surgical expertise. =Legal rights= Legal issues regarding transgender persons in the United States began in 1966 with Mtr. of Anonymous v. Weiner, concerning a person who wanted their birth certificate name and sex updated following sex reassignment surgery. Changes to passports, licenses, birth certificates, and other official documents remained a theme from the 60s through 2010, when the State Department allowed gender on U.S. passports to be altered.

The ruling concluded that individuals who have undergone full sexual reassignment surgery, and whose sexual reassignment has been recognized by civil authorities, are considered to have changed their sex status according to Jewish law. Furthermore, it concluded that sexual reassignment surgery is an acceptable treatment under Jewish law for individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria. In 2014 the American Medical Association adopted a policy stating that transgender people should not be required to undergo genital surgery in order to update legal identification documents, including birth certificates. Also in 2014, Facebook introduced dozens of options for users to specify their gender, including a custom gender option, as well as allowing users to select between three pronouns: \\"him,\\" \\"her\\" or \\"their.\\" Later that year Facebook added a gender- neutral option for users to use when identifying family members, for example Parent (gender neutral) and Child (gender neutral).

Foods and food preparation by the early Japanese Neolithic settlements can be pieced together from archaeological studies, and reveals paramount importance of rice and seafood since early times. The Kofun period (3rd to 7th centuries) is shrouded in uncertainty. Some entries in Japan's earliest written chronicles hint at a picture of food habits from the time of the formation of the Yamato dynasty. When Buddhism became widely accepted with the rise of the Soga clan, a taboo on the eating meat (especially mammals) began to be enforced, and became common practice, although wild game was still being taken by mountain people, and would be eaten by townspeople when the opportunity arose. Treatises on ceremony, tax documents, and fiction allows one to make a list of food ingredients used, and basic preparation methods in the Heian period. However anything like recipes from the Middle Ages are a rare commodity in Japan or any country. Records throughout Middle Ages may give some idea of the dishes being enjoyed, but do not give details such as to provide accurate recipes. Once Japan entered the Edo period, there were rich records of foods and cuisine from commoners (i.e., non-samurai), who were largely literate, and produced a great deal of wood-block printed literature. Heian period (794 to 1185) Following the J≈çmon period (14,000‚Äì300 BCE), Japanese society shifted from semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer lifestyle to an agricultural society. This was the period in which rice cultivation began, having been introduced by China around the third century BCE. Rice was commonly boiled plain and called gohan or meshi, and, as cooked rice has since been the preferred staple of the meal, the terms are used as synonyms for the word \\"meal\\". Peasants often mixed millet with rice, especially in mountainous regions where rice did not proliferate., 1176. During the Kofun period (300 to 538 AD), Chinese culture was introduced into Japan from Korea. As such, Buddhism became influential on Japanese culture. After the 6th century, Japan directly pursued the imitation of Chinese culture of the Tang dynasty (618 to 907)., 46‚Äì48. It was this influence that marked the taboos on the consumption of meat in Japan. In 675 AD, Emperor Tenmu decreed a prohibition on the consumption of cattle, horses, dogs, monkeys, and chickens during the 4th-9th months of the year; to break the law would mean a death sentence. Monkey was eaten prior to this time, but was eaten more in a ritualistic style for medicinal purposes. Chickens were often domesticated as pets, while cattle and horses were rare and treated as such. A cow or horse would be ritually sacrificed on the first day of rice paddy cultivation, a ritual introduced from China. Emperor Temmu's decree, however, did not ban the consumption of deer or wild boar, which were important to the Japanese diet at that time., 53‚Äì54. The Heian Period (794 to 1185) in the 8th century saw many additional decrees made by emperors and empresses banning the killing of any animals. In 752 AD, Empress K≈çken decreed a ban on fishing, but made a promise that adequate rice would be given to fishermen whose livelihood would have otherwise been destroyed. In 927 AD, regulations were enacted that stated that any government official or member of nobility that ate meat was deemed unclean for three days and could not participate in Shinto observances at the imperial court., 55‚Äì56. Chopsticks on a chopstick rest It was also the influence of Chinese cultures through Korea that brought chopsticks to Japan early in this period., 67 \\"chopsticks originated in ancient China, spreading from the Yeelow River basin, which was then the center of Chinese civilization, to surrounding regions from about fifth century BCE.\\"The International Institute of Hashi Osaka Kyoiku University ÁÆ∏„ÅÆ‰ºùÊù• \\"Transmission of chopsticks\\"Komazawa Women's University \\"ÁÆ∏„Å®Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫ (Chopsticks and Japanese) Chopsticks at this time were used by nobility at banquets; they were not used as everyday utensils however, as hands were still commonly used to eat. Metal spoons were also used during the 8th and 9th centuries, but only by the nobility., 67‚Äì69. Dining tables were also introduced to Japan at this time. Commoners used a legless table called a oshiki, while nobility used a lacquered table with legs called a zen. Each person used his own table. Lavish banquets for the nobility would have multiple tables for each individual based upon the number of dishes presented., 71 Upon the decline of the Tang dynasty in the 9th century, Japan made a move toward its individuality in culture and cuisine. The abandonment of the spoon as a dining utensil ‚Äì which was retained in Korea ‚Äì is one of the marked differences, and commoners were now eating with chopsticks as well. Trade continued with China and Korea, but influence en masse from outside Japan would not be seen again until the 19th century. The 10th and 11th centuries marked a level of refinement of cooking and etiquette found in the culture of the Heian nobility. Court chefs would prepare many of the vegetables sent as tax from the countryside. Court banquets were common and lavish; garb for nobility during these events remained in the Chinese style which differentiated them from the plain clothes of commoners., 50‚Äì51. The dishes consumed after the 9th century included grilled fish and meat (yakimono), simmered food (nimono), steamed foods (mushimono), soups made from chopped vegetables, fish or meat (atsumono), jellied fish (nikogori) simmered with seasonings, sliced raw fish served in a vinegar sauce (namasu), vegetables, seaweed or fish in a strong dressing (aemono), and pickled vegetables (tsukemono) that were cured in salt to cause lactic fermentation. Oil and fat were avoided almost universally in cooking. Sesame oil was used, but rarely, as it was of great expense to produce., 71‚Äì72. Documents from the Heian nobility note that fish and wild fowl were common fare along with vegetables. Their banquet settings consisted of a bowl of rice and soup, along with chopsticks, a spoon, and three seasonings which were salt, vinegar and hishio, which was a fermentation of soybeans, wheat, sake and salt. A fourth plate was present for mixing the seasonings to desired flavor for dipping the food. The four types of food present at a banquet consisted of dried foods (himono), fresh foods (namamono), fermented or dressed food (kubotsuki), and desserts (kashi). Dried fish and fowl were thinly sliced (e.g. salted salmon, pheasant, steamed and dried abalone, dried and grilled octopus), while fresh fish, shellfish and fowl were sliced raw in vinegar sauce or grilled (e.g. carp, sea bream, salmon, trout, pheasant). Kubotsuki consisted of small balls of fermented sea squirt, fish or giblets along with jellyfish and aemono. Desserts would have included Chinese cakes, and a variety of fruits and nuts including pine nuts, dried chestnuts, acorns, jujube, pomegranate, peach, apricot, persimmon and citrus. The meal would be ended with sake., 73‚Äì74. Kamakura period (1192-1333) The Kamakura period marked a large political change in Japan. Prior to the Kamakura period, the samurai were guards of the landed estates of the nobility. The nobility, having lost control of the Japanese countryside, fell under the militaristic rule of the peasant class samurai, with a military government being set up in 1192 in Kamakura giving way to the period. Once the position of power had been exchanged, the role of the court banquets changed. The court cuisine which had prior to this time emphasized flavor and nutritional aspects changed to a highly ceremonial and official role., 51. Minamoto no Yoritomo, the first sh≈çgun, punished other samurai who followed the earlier showy banquet style of the nobility. The sh≈çgun banquet, called ≈çban, was attended by military leaders from the provinces. The ≈çban originally referred to a luncheon on festival days attended by soldiers and guards during the Heian period, and was attached to the warrior class. The menu usually consisted of dried abalone, jellyfish aemono, pickled ume called umeboshi, salt and vinegar for seasoning, and rice. Later in the period, the honzen-ry≈çri banquet became popularized., 74‚Äì75. The cuisine of the samurai came distinctly from their peasant roots. The meals prepared emphasized simplicity while being substantial. The cuisine avoided refinement, ceremony and luxury, and shed all further Chinese influence. One specific example is the change from wearing traditional Chinese garb to a distinct clothing style that combined the simple clothing of the common people. This style evolved into the kimono by the end of the Middle Ages., 51‚Äì52. The Buddhist vegetarian philosophy strengthened during the Kamakura period as it began to spread to the peasants. Those who were involved in the trade of slaughtering animals for food or leather came under discrimination. Those practicing this trade were considered in opposition to the Buddhist philosophy of not taking life, while under the Shinto philosophy they were considered defiled. This discrimination intensified, and eventually led to the creation of a separate caste, the burakumin., 58.

The Kuriyama is known as the southernmost river in Japan with a salmon run. The is located at the mouth of the river in Yokoshibahikari. Origin of name By tradition, in the 7th century the former town of Kurihara, now part of Katori, saw an influx of immigrants from the Korean Peninsula.

The Kuriyama crosses the Kuj≈´kuri Plain and pours into the Pacific Ocean at the midpoint of Kuj≈´kuri Beach in Yokoshibahikari. =Tributaries=   * Salmon The Kuriyama River is the southernmost river in Japan with a salmon run, and the salmon play an important part in the history and local culture of the Kuriyama River region. The rapid increase of population and industrial development on the tributaries of the Kuriyama have seriously reduced the number of salmon in the river. The Chiba prefectural government, as well as the municipalities of Katori, Tako, Shibayama, and Yokoshibahikari have formed the to reverse the trend. The association carries out capture and research operations from mid-October to late December at the Yokoshiba Dam in Yokoshibahikari during the salmon run. Researchers extract eggs from the salmon and carry out fertilization of the population. The association also carries out artificial fertilization and fry discharge projects. Residents in the Kuriyama River area interested in the repopulation of the salmon cooperate in the hatching, care and distribution of salmon hatchlings from late January until their release along the river in early March. The first fry discharge was carried out in 1977, and the first successful salmon run from the fry discharge was in 1980. History The Kuriyama River area has been settled from very early in Japanese history. Excavation of the Iizuka Historic Remains Site, the Kashiwakuma Kofun Group, and the Ogawadai Kofun Group, located along the upper reaches of the Kuriyama and its tributaries, attest to the prosperity of northern Chiba Prefecture in the Kofun period (250 - 538). Excavation of kofun tumuli and other sites along the Kuriyama has revealed a wide variety of haniwa clay funerary objects, swords, horse bridles, and other implements of daily use typical of the period. The Kuriyama was later developed into sh≈çen estates used for the production of rice. The upper areas of the river were part of the Katori ranch land, and the Takaya tributary of the Kuriyama was noted for its population of feral horses. The Yamakura Shrine and Yamakura Kanpuku-ji, both likely built in the early 9th century, have long held religious ceremonies associated with the Kuriyama River salmon. Kanpuku- ji was part of the Yamakura Shrine complex until their division shortly after the Meiji Restoration. In 1871, under the shinbutsu bunri separation of Buddhist temples and shrines, the shrine and temple were separated, but both continue to carry out ceremonies related to the salmon. The festival historically occurred in November with the coming of the salmon up the Kuriyama. The Yamakura Shrine festival is known as the , and is held on the first Sunday of December. Use The entirety of the Kuriyama River provides irrigation to paddy fields. Areas along the river were historically rich in rice production, and remain so today. Farms along the Kuriyama have diversified from rice and other grain production to vegetable farming, notably of sweet potatoes. The Edo period ranches no longer exist on the upper reaches of the Kuriyama, but pig farming is still carried out along the upper reaches of the river in Katori. Recreation The Kuriyama River is a popular fishing spot. Carp, Carassius, the Crucian carp and flathead mullet are all found in great quantity. The fishing of salmon, formerly widespread along the Kuriyama, is now limited due to the decrease of the salmon population. Cities and towns along the river now consider the Kuriyama a precious commodity, and fishing events are held in relation to the salmon catch in each town and city. 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami The Kuriyama River was inundated by a tsunami caused by the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami on March 3, 2011. The tsunami traveled up the river. Flooding from the tsunami, while insignificant compared to other regions of Japan, damaged river embankments, homes and the Yamakuragawa Fishing Port across the lower part of the river.

It is the only known military and civilian site established by British forces on American soil following the War of 1812. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1956. History =Establishment= Map of Fort Drummond Site; created c. 1896 Whitney Bay, Site of Fort Drummond, c. 1959 photo The Treaty of Ghent, signed in late 1814, required British troops to vacate the captured Fort Mackinac on Mackinac Island. The terms of the treaty, however, did not reach the Fort Mackinac garrison until May 15, 1815. The instructions to the fort's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robert McDonall, were to vacate Fort Mackinac and re-establish a garrison within British territory but relatively close to Mackinac Island.Cook, p. 25. In particular, it was important that the new site be sufficiently close to the Straits of Mackinac that the British could continue to exert their considerable influence on the Native American peoples tribes and the fur trade in the upper Great Lakes region. McDonall considered several sites in the area, and finally settled on a site on the west end of the then-unnamed Drummond Island.Cook, p. 32. The transfer of stores and men to the new site was slow to accomplish, and it took McDonall's garrison until July 18, 1815, to completely empty Fort Mackinac, which was then turned over to American forces.Cook, p. 40. Some of the forces under McDonall's command were mustered out in the latter part of 1815 and were shipped home, but by the time the transfer to Drummond Island was complete, the garrison consisted of some 350‚Äì400 people. These men were set to work constructing structures on Drummond Island, but due to lack of training, the progress was slow. In addition, there was some uncertainty as to whether Drummond Island was actually a British or American possession, according to the Treaty of Ghent, so the British were somewhat reluctant to put a substantial fortification in place.Cook, pp. 42‚Äì3. Eventually, buildings located on St. Joseph Island belonging to the North West Company were purchased, disassembled, and re-assembled in order to provide shelter for the coming winter.Cook, pp. 47‚Äì8. There was still some uncertainty as to the final disposition of Drummond Island, and thus the British government was reluctant to expend much manpower or materiel fortifying Fort Drummond.Cook, pp. 63‚Äì5. Some few military structures were erected, but on the whole there was no real boundary between the military and civilian sections of the \\"fort\\". In 1816, McDonall resigned his commission and was replaced by Lt. Col. Maule; in 1817 Maule was replaced by Major Thomas Howard and then by Major James Winnett. Through this period the military emplacement on Drummond Island remained substantially as it had been at the end of 1815. =Abandonment= Winnett was relieved by Major Goff in June 1822. However, in 1822, it was determined that Drummond Island was actually part of the United States, per the Treaty of Ghent. Still, the British forces were in no hurry to leave Fort Drummond, and Goff was replaced in June 1824 by Lieutenant James J. Gaston, who was relieved in June 1827 by Lieutenant Thomas Carson.Cook, pp. 66‚Äì7. In the interim, a suitable location for the relocation of the Fort Drummond troops was sought; finally a site in what is now Penetanguishene, on the southeast corner of Georgian Bay, was tentatively selected.Cook, pp. 79‚Äì81. By 1828, the United States government demanded that Fort Drummond be abandoned by the British, and they hurriedly did so, shipping troops and materiel to Penetanguishene. However, due to lack of shipping space, much food and personal belongings such as furniture were left behind by the departing British. American forces, led by Lieutenant T. Pierce Simonton, took possession of the fort on November 14, 1828. However, the US military did not occupy the fort. Some of the village houses remained occupied for at least the remainder of the winter, but it is not clear when the site was finally abandoned. At some point, what was likely a natural forest fire destroyed the remainder of the fort.Cook, pp. 83‚Äì5. Description Chimney from Fort Drummond, c. 1959 photo The settlement at Fort Drummond contained military structures as well as private houses. The settlement was centered around a parade ground fronting on the west side of the bay. Military barracks and commissary were located on the west side of the parade ground, and officer's quarters were haphazardly placed in the area. A \\"boulevard\\" ran along northward from the parade ground a good , while a military road continued southward of the parade ground to the shore. The section of land east of the boulevard, between the boulevard and the bay, was reserved for gardens, while houses were built on the west side of the boulevard. The boulevard was lined by a row of poplar trees on each side.Cook, p. 15. Some of the houses were substantial, and a few were two stories. Other houses were \\"bark lodges,\\" made of a pole framework covered with cedar. Kitchens for the houses were located some distance away, and much of the cooking and baking was done in a public bakery reserved for that purpose.Cook, p. 8. The cemetery was located to the west of the fort, some ways up the ridge rising from the bay. The cemetery was platted at , and enclosed by a cedar rail fence.Cook, p. 21. The cemetery likely holds around 300 people, many of the burials dating from the scurvy outbreak in the winter of 1815‚Äì6 and the smallpox outbreak of 1824. Many of the grave markers are now located in the Drummond Island Museum. A lime quarry and kiln is located south of the town; this location was likely used to produce mortar for the chimneys. A saw mill was also located north of the town; this may or may not have been contemporaneous with Fort Drummond, but evidence of sawn logs in the fort buildings was confirmed.Cook, p. 12‚Äì3. Some of the islands in Whitney Bay were also used by the fort, with the fort surgeon living on one and another used for artillery target practice. As of 2012, the Fort Drummond site is private property, and the site is only viewable from the water. At least one of the remaining chimneys has been incorporated into a cabin. The Fort Drummond site contains 74 features, most of which are the remains of chimneys and structural platforms. There are also two wells, two wharves, and a cemetery. Faint traces of foundations can still be seen. {class=\\"wikitable unsortable\\" ! style=\\"background:light gray; color:black\\"Images of Fort Drummond area, c. 1896 File:Fort Drummond - Barracks.jpgRemains of the barracks File:Fort Drummond, Drummond Island MI - Officers Quarters 2.jpgRemains of the officer's quarters File:Fort Drummond - Officers Quarters.jpgRemains of the officer's quarters File:Fort Drummond - On The Hill.jpgRuins on the hill File:Fort Drummond - Cemetery.jpgHeadstones in the cemetery File:Fort Drummond , Drummond Island MI- Harbor.jpgHarbor serving the fort File:Fort Drummond - Parade Ground 2.jpgLooking out over the parade ground File:Fort Drummond - Parade Ground Location.jpgLooking out over the parade ground toward the harbor } References Works cited * Drummond Category:Buildings and structures in Chippewa County, Michigan Drummond Category:Lake Huron Category:Government buildings completed in 1815 Category:1815 establishments in Michigan Territory Drummond Category:Michigan State Historic Sites Category:National Register of Historic Places in Chippewa County, Michigan Category:1815 establishments in Upper Canada Category:Military history of Michigan ","title":"Fort Drummond (Drummond Island, Michigan)"},{"id":"35722961","text":"Han Jue (; died after 566 BC), posthumously known as Han Xianzi (), was the fifth head of the House of Han and a Jin politician and general.

History During a highly active period of building construction and religious dedications following the Second Punic War, the aediles of 193 BC, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Lucius Aemilius Paullus, built a monumental portico linking the Porta Fontinalis to the Altar of Mars in the Campus Martius.Livy 35.10.12; John E.

Most notoriously, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the supposed poisoner of the Emperor Tiberius' heir apparent Germanicus, had built structures above the gate to connect his private residences. The resulting domus was criticized for dominating the architectural profile of the site. As part of the punitive measures against the associates, family, and memory of Piso in the wake of the conspiracy, the senate ordered the demolition of these structures.Tacitus, Annales 3.9.3; Greg Rowe, Princes and Political Cultures: The New Tiberian Senatorial Decrees (University of Michigan Press, 2002), p. 15; O.F.

She drowned her daughter Phoebe in the Wanganui River in 1883 and was tried and subsequently convicted of murder. While she was sentenced to death, her sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. She died in Wellington's Terrace Gaol on 2 September 1891. Drowning of daughter and conviction On Monday 26 February 1883, Veitch drowned her four-year-old daughter (also named Phoebe Veitch) in the Wanganui River. According to a contemporary newspaper account,\\"The Child Murder Case:\\" Wanganui Chronicle: 1 May 1883: pg2 the body of the younger Phoebe Veitch was found on the Wanganui River beach on the morning of 27 February by Arthur Fitchett, a telegraph linesperson. Giving medical testimony, Dr Earle noted that the drowned child was the product of a cross-cultural relationship between persons of Chinese and European descent. According to Mrs Eliza Blight, a second witness, Mrs Phoebe Veitch had two children- Albert (7) and \\"Flossie\\" (Phoebe) (4). Mrs Blight noted that Mrs Veitch was having difficulty bringing up both of her children and had intended to send her daughter to Feilding, a northern settlement in the Manawatu district in the North Island of New Zealand. Mrs Blight noted that Mrs Veitch had tried to make her friend believe that the daughter was in danger from her aunt and might drown her.\\"The Child Murder Case\\" Wanganui Chronicle: 1 May 1883: pg2 Wanganui Police Inspector James was the next witness. At first, Mrs Veitch said she did not know where her daughter was, but under further investigation from the inspector and two police officers, she then claimed that her daughter had fallen accidentally from the Wanganui River wharf and drowned. Subsequently, after being taken to view her child's body, Mrs. Veitch changed her story once more and then stated that it was the child's putative father who killed her. She said his name was \\"Sam Timaru\\" and gave contradictory descriptions of his ethnicity as either from India or Scotland. Further evidence revealed that Mrs. Veitch was a single parent and had been abandoned by her children's father to bring them up alone. Her partner did not appear during the trial to substantiate these claims. The jury retired and found Phoebe Veitch guilty of murder, but with a recommendation of mercy. Mrs. Veitch was pregnant with another child at the time, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court then sentenced her to death, although it remained to be disclosed whether the pregnancy could be substantiated by local midwives. Reprieve and death On 25 May it was reported that Ministers of the Crown had intervened in the case and commuted Mrs. Veitch's sentence to life imprisonment.\\"Phoebe Veitch Reprieved\\" Grey River Argus: 25 May 1883 She was imprisoned in Wellington at the Terrace Gaol and died on 2 September 1891 \\"Death of Phoebe Veitch\\" Wanganui Chronicle: 3 September 1891 Comparing the Veitch case with those of Caroline Whitting, Sarah-Jane and Anna Flannagan and Minnie Dean, Bronwyn Dalley has suggested that the courts were willing to recognise that arduous social and family circumstances could lead to maternal 'madness' and may have prompted commuted sentences, while Dean's death sentence was related to an element of deliberation absent in the Veitch, Whitting and other cases of parental child murder.Bronwyn Dalley: \\"Criminal Conversations: Gender and narratives of child murder in nineteenth century New Zealand\\" in Caroline Dalley and Julie Montgomerie (eds) The Gendered Kiwi: Auckland: Auckland University Press: 1999 See also *Minnie Dean, the only woman executed in New Zealand history. *Caroline Whitting, also sentenced to death in 1872, after the murder of three of her own children, but also reprieved. *Lillian Fanny Jane Hobbs, acquitted of negligence and infant death after childbirth in 1907. *Infanticide in 19th-century New Zealand References Further reading *Bronwyn Daley: \\"Criminal Conversations: Gender and narratives of child murder in nineteenth century New Zealand\\" in Caroline Dalley and Julie Montgomerie (eds) The Gendered Kiwi: Auckland: Auckland University Press: 1999.
