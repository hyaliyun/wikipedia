OP Bari Alai was established in the spring of 2009 by TF Raider (6/4 Cavalry, 3rd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division) and built by members of Marine Embedded Training Team 7-4, following increased attacks against U.S. and Afghan National Army (ANA) forces and civilians transiting north and south along the Konar river valley. OP Bari Alai was named after an ANA soldier who was killed in an IED strike just months before the creation of the OP. The OP was also aimed at providing security to the local district center just below the observation outpost. Aftermath of OP Bari Alai following the May 1st, 2009 attack. OP Bari Alai Attacks OP Bari Alai is best known for a large-scale Taliban attack on May 1, 2009, when an estimated force of 100-200 Taliban assaulted the Observation Post. The Taliban assault force successfully held the OP point, killing all three Americans (Ryan King,SPC. Ryan King SGT James Pirtle,SGT James Pirtle and SSG William \\"Bill\\" Vile) stationed at the OP,1 linguist Azizullah, 2 Latvian soldiers were killed and a 4th being wounded. 3 ANA soldiers were killed during the attack and 12 ANA soldiers and 1 linguist Farhad Sahak were taken prisoner by the Taliban. Taliban forces later released multiple videos of the attack in which the looting of OP Bari Alai and the escorting of prisoners is clearly seen. Following the attack on OP Bari Alai, a large military operation followed to secure the release of the 12 ANA soldiers taken captive. Hundreds of U.S., ANA, and Afghan National Army Commandos flooded the region, killing dozens of Taliban insurgents. The prisoners were then eventually released following the operation and they were debriefed concerning the events of the attacks. According to U.S. military reporting OP Bari Alai was attacked several hundred times by Taliban fighters within the first year of its creation.

The Aubrey Valley supports a population of endangered black-footed ferrets, reintroduced in 1996 due to Valley's prairie dog colonies and favorable grassland habitat. Access The south valley region, near its south perimeter is traversed by Arizona State Route 66, (former U.S. 66), from Seligman, Arizona at the valley's southeast, and at the south terminus of the Aubrey Cliffs; (Seligman is at Interstate 40). Route 66 traverses north-east across the south valley terminus region to Grand Canyon Caverns, then mostly west across the Yampai Divide to Peach Springs, Arizona at the beginning of hills, and mountains. The central valley has two routes that spur northwards from Arizona 66, west of Grand Canyon Caverns. The routes traverse west, and east of the central wash that drains from the north. Both routes are unimproved roads, and connect to Reservation Route 20, (Hualapai Reservation).

Binn Mhór is the 3rd-highest mountain in the Maumturks range. Naming Irish academic Paul Tempan records that Binn Mhór has also been called \\"Shannakeala\\". Geography Binn Mhór lies on a small massif in the southeast sector of the Maumturks range, separated from the main range by a deep east-west mountain pass called Máméan. Máméan has been a site of pilgrimage dedicated to Saint Patrick since the 5th century, and several historical items are dug into the lower southerly slopes of Binn Chaonaigh (), on the northern side of Máméan, including a holy well, a cleft in the rock known as Saint Patrick's Bed () where the saint reputedly slept, a circle of stones for the Stations of the Cross, and a Mass Rock (). Binn Mhór's massif has a high east-west ridge with three subsidiary peaks. To the west, and directly overlooking Máméan, is the subsidiary summit of Binn Mhór West Top () also known as , whose prominence of qualifies it as an Arderin Beg. To the east along the ridge are the subsidiary summits of Binn Mhór NE Top (), whose prominence of qualifies it as an Vandeleur-Lynam; and Binn Mhór East Top (), whose prominence of only means it does not qualify on any recognised scale. Further east along the ridge of Binn Mhor's massif lie the peaks of Mullach Glas () and Corcogemore (). Binn Mhór's prominence of qualifies it as a Marilyn, and it also ranks as the 89th-highest mountain in Ireland on the MountainViews Online Database, 100 Highest Irish Mountains, where the minimum prominence is 100 metres. Hill walking The most straightforward route to the summit of Binn Mhór is the 6-kilometre 2-hour roundtrip route from the pass at Máméan and back; however, because of its positioning on a high ridge of its own small massif, it can also be climbed as a 10-kilometre 4–5 hour route from Corcogemore in the west, across Mullach Ghlas, to the summit of Binn Mhor, and then finishing down at Máméan (e.g. the route requires two cars). Binn Mhór is also climbed as part of the Maamturks Challenge, a 25-kilometre 10–12 hour walk over the full Maumturks range (from Maam Cross to Leenaun), which is considered one of the \\"great classic ridge- walks of Ireland\\", but of \\"extreme grade\\" due to the circa 7,600 feet of total ascent. Since 1975, the University College Galway Mountaineering Club has run the annual \\"Maamturks Challenge Walk\\" (MCW), and man a checkpoint in the Máméan pass; climbers descend from Binn Mhór at 661 metres to Máméan at only 150 metres, before re-ascending to Binn Chaonaigh at 633 metres.

His most important work, though, was the “Illustrated Dictionary“, which soon was regarded as the standard reference work, a French edition also being published at the time. The Royal Horticultural Society's present Dictionary of Gardening published by Oxford, has Nicholson's Illustrated Dictionary as its basis, and has retained its predecessor's layout.The Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening Nicholson was an authority on oaks and maples, and was appointed as judge in the horticulture section of the Chicago Exposition of 1893. He also inspected the Arnold Arboretum and a few other outstanding gardens in the United States, reporting back in a paper entitled \\"Horticulture and Arboriculture in the United States\\" published in the Kew Bulletin of February 1894. Page from \\"The Illustrated Dictionary of Gardening\\" He was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1898, and in 1894 he was awarded The Veitch Memorial Medal in recognition of his services to gardening and the Victoria Medal of Honour in 1897. His collection of British plants was left to Professor Trail which, together with Trail’s specimens laid the foundation of the British collection at Aberdeen.

The Milwaukee Rescue Mission is a shelter for homeless and ailing families. Since 1893, it has worked with the hungry and hurting of Milwaukee, helping them restore their lives and their hope. In its Milwaukee home, any given night will see nearly 1,500 homeless people will be on the streets. The Milwaukee Rescue Mission seeks to meet those in need where they are. The Milwaukee Rescue Mission offers practical assistance like food (approximately 300,000 meals this year), clothing (nearly 40,000 items), and shelter (over 100,000 nights). In addition, the shelter offers transformative programs that equip struggling men, women, and children to get off the streets and turn their lives around for good. While practical assistance is important, the Milwaukee Rescue Mission supplies both short- and long-term assistance, complemented by education, counseling, help in overcoming substance abuse, job training and much more. The organization bases its programs on addressing the root causes of problems, rather than simple temporary fixes. As a non- denominational Christian organization, it provides spiritual development and enrichment, all based on the good news of the Gospel; it professes that the Gospel message is the key to lasting change. The Milwaukee Rescue Mission is part of the Association of Gospel Rescue Missions.  Location  The Milwaukee Rescue Mission is located at 830 N 19th Street in the historic Milwaukee Girls' Trade and Technical High School building in the Avenues West neighborhood of Milwaukee. Milwaukee was heavily affected by the loss of heavy industry and manufacturing, holding the position of the second poorest city in the United States. The Milwaukee Rescue Mission has occupied the main campus at the corner of 19th and Wells since 1986. Prior to that, the shelter was located in a building near the BMO Harris Bradley Center. The City of Milwaukee claimed eminent domain over that property, which now serves as a parking lot for the stadium. In 2015, the organization acquired its North Campus, located on 15th and Center in the heart of the Lindsay Heights neighborhood. Lindsay Heights is located in the zipcode 53206, recently featured in the award-winning documentary Milwaukee 53206 as the most incarcerated zip code in the United States. Milwaukee Rescue Mission's North Campus currently houses its school, Cross Trainers Academy, and a certified daycare, the Child Enrichment Center. The Main Campus continues to contain a men's shelter, Safe Harbor, and its shelter for women with children, Joy House. Services Due to the great need in the Milwaukee area, the Milwaukee Rescue Mission has a broad range of services, including the following: * Safe Harbor for Men: Safe Harbor provides food, shelter, clothing, and educational opportunities for homeless men. For those with short-term, emergency needs, the Milwaukee Rescue Mission provides meals, shelter, clothing, counseling, education and job search resources. In addition to short term help, The Milwaukee Rescue Mission also offers two long-term programs. New Journey is a long-term addiction recovery program that equips men through daily Bible studies, computer-based and instructor-led education programs, GED preparation and testing, work therapy and on-the-job training, personal mentoring, educational support, financial/legal guidance and assistance in securing employment and housing. For men who graduate from New Journey, the FOCUS (Following Our Commitment Under Supervision) program allows for transitional living that continues to prepare men to live out new lives. The comprehensive services of FOCUS help men secure employment, manage their finances, handle legal issues, find strength through Christian counseling and restore broken relationships. *Joy House for Women and Children: Joy House provides housing and assistance for women and their families who are homeless. There are many reasons that women may find themselves homeless, but primary reasons include domestic violence, divorce, death of a spouse and job loss. In addition to emergency aid, Joy House cares for women through two primary programs: New Life and Fresh Start. New Life includes two weeks of classes and serves as a first step towards starting over. New Life equips women with the real-world skills and spiritual guidance they need to prepare for an independent, stable and secure life. The program includes: job search training, basic adult education, Christian counseling and education, parenting and life-skills classes, financial management principles and one-on-one case management. *Cross Trainers Academy: Cross Trainers Academy was founded in 2006 to reach the at-risk youth of Milwaukee. Without a solid education, compassionate mentors and a firm foundation, many are likely to perpetuate the cycle of poverty and its frequent results: violence, substance abuse and homelessness. Study after study has shown that education is the best ticket out of such situations. Milwaukee Rescue Mission started Cross Trainers Academy with the express purpose of providing at-risk children with the opportunity for an excellent, Christian-based education that will equip them with academic, social, emotional and spiritual tools for life. In 2015, the school moved to the new North Campus at 15th and Center streets. CTA has approximately 300 students enrolled with a 20:1 student/staff ratio. The school serves students from pre-kindergarten through 10th grade, with more grades to be added in coming years. *Equip: Equip focuses on building strong families in Joy House and the neighboring community through education and resources to help them become stable physically, emotionally and spiritually. Programming in Equip includes an annual summer day-camp for children in the community called City Camp, as well as tutoring programs offered throughout the school year. City Camp focuses on maintaining learning over the summer and caring for youth in a safe environment. In addition to academics, City Camp includes spiritual education and weekly off-site field trips. Equip also gives school supplies, backpacks, clothing, and food items to children and their parents. And, with the move to the North Campus came the opening of a certified daycare, the Child Enrichment Center. Accommodating children from four weeks to four years old, CEC helps to prepare children for the K4 experience and provides them with a safe and loving environment. Sponsorship A list of event sponsors can be accessed on the Milwaukee Rescue Mission's site. The efforts of the Milwaukee Rescue Mission are made possible by generous gifts from individuals, churches and businesses.

The case m=2 and d=3 is an elliptic curve, the case m=2 and d\\\\ge 5 is a hyperelliptic curve, and the case m=3 and d\\\\geq is an example of a trigonal curve. Some authors impose additional restrictions, for example, that the integer m should not be divisible by the characteristic of k, that the polynomial f should be square free, that the integers m and d should be coprime, or some combination of these. The Diophantine problem of finding integer points on a superelliptic curve can be solved by a method similar to one used for the resolution of hyperelliptic equations: a Siegel identity is used to reduce to a Thue equation.  Definition  More generally, a superelliptic curve is a cyclic branched covering :C \\\\to \\\\mathbb{P}^1 of the projective line of degree m \\\\geq 2 coprime to the characteristic of the field of definition. The degree m of the covering map is also referred to as the degree of the curve. By cyclic covering we mean that the Galois group of the covering (i.e., the corresponding function field extension) is cyclic. The fundamental theorem of Kummer theory implies that a superelliptic curve of degree m defined over a field k has an affine model given by an equation :y^m = f(x) for some polynomial f \\\\in k[x] of degree m with each root having order < m, provided that C has a point defined over k, that is, if the set C(k) of k-rational points of C is not empty. For example, this is always the case when k is algebraically closed. In particular, function field extension k(C)/k(x) is a Kummer extension. Ramification Let C: y^m = f(x) be a superelliptic curve defined over an algebraically closed field k, and B' \\\\subset k denote the set of roots of f in k. Define set :B = \\\\begin{cases} B' &\\\\text{ if }m\\\\text{ divides }\\\\deg(f),  B'\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{\\\\infty\\\\\\\\} &\\\\text{ otherwise.}\\\\end{cases} Then B \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{P}^1(k) is the set of branch points of the covering map C \\\\to \\\\mathbb{P}^1 given by x. For an affine branch point \\\\alpha \\\\in B, let r_\\\\alpha denote the order of \\\\alpha as a root of f. As before, we assume that 1 \\\\leq r_\\\\alpha < m. Then :e_\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{m}{(m, r_\\\\alpha)} is the ramification index e(P_{\\\\alpha, i}) at each of the (m, r_\\\\alpha) ramification points P_{\\\\alpha, i} of the curve lying over \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{A}^1(k) \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{P}^1(k) (that is actually true for any \\\\alpha \\\\in k). For the point at infinity, define integer 0 \\\\leq r_\\\\infty < m as follows. If :s = \\\\min \\\\\\\\{t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}  mt \\\\geq \\\\deg(f) \\\\\\\\}, then r_\\\\infty = ms - \\\\deg(f). Note that (m, r_\\\\infty) = (m, \\\\deg(f)). Then analogously to the other ramification points, :e_\\\\infty = \\\\frac{m}{(m, r_\\\\infty)} is the ramification index e(P_{\\\\infty, i}) at the (m, r_\\\\infty) points P_{\\\\infty, i} that lie over \\\\infty. In particular, the curve is unramified over infinity if and only if its degree m divides \\\\deg(f). Curve C defined as above is connected precisely when m and r_\\\\alpha are relatively prime (not necessarily pairwise), which is assumed to be the case. Genus By the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, the genus of a superelliptic curve is given by :g = \\\\frac12 \\\\left( m (B - 2) - \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha \\\\in B} (m, r_\\\\alpha)\\\\right) + 1.

It depicts a nude Trajan holding in his arms the Capitoline Wolf, which is doubled as the Dacian Draco, the war standard of the Dacians. Description The 2.15-metre high statue is made out of bronze and has a weight of 500 kilograms. The cost of the statue was around 200,000 lei (45,000 €) The artist created three copies of the sculpture: another is located in Sevilla, Spain, on the banks of the Guadalquivir, and another in Rome, in front of Accademia di Romania. The sculpture depicts Trajan, the Roman emperor who conquered Dacia, the province located in today's Romania and considered one of the \\"parents\\" of the Romanian nation. In his arms, in fact appearing to levitate above his arms, is the Capitoline Wolf, the she-wolf in the founding myth of Rome. The head of the wolf is joined to the tail of a Dacian Draco. History The statue was created at the initiative of the Bucharest City Hall as part of a larger program of city's administration called \\"Calea Victoriei – Cultural Trail\\", being recommended to them by Răzvan Theodorescu. It is based on a plaster model made by Vasile Gorduz, currently owned by Artmark Galleries, while the bronze cast was made by artist Ioan Bolborea. The statue was installed in November 2011, but it was covered with plastic foil and it was only unveiled on April 29, 2012 by Sorin Oprescu, the Mayor of Bucharest. Reception The statue, after being vandalized in September 2017 The director the National Museum of Romanian History, Ernest Oberländer Târnoveanu, said he thinks it shouldn't have been placed there due to its \\"doubtful artistic quality\\", and appreciated that it won't stay there for a long time. On the other hand, Mihai Oroveanu, the director of the National Museum of Contemporary Art thought it's a \\"beautiful\\" and \\"very modern\\" work, while Răzvan Theodorescu called it a \\"symbol of our nation\\". The statue was not well received by Bucharesters, who met it with derision, due to the nudity and the awkwardness of Trajan's statue, being described as \\"a monument to Romania's stray dogs\\", with commentators wondering why \\"the dog is levitating\\", and why the animal wears a scarf \\"while the emperor isn't even wearing any underwear\\".\\"Howls of derision in Bucharest as Romania statue unveiled\\", BBC, May 3, 2012 According to Deutsche Welle, the Bucharest public met it with a \\"stubborn conservatism which opposes any attempt towards urban renewal\\", still displaying the stupefaction of the first visitors to modernist exhibitions.\\"Traian şi turnirul ofenselor\\", Deutsche Welle, May 11, 2012 References Category:Outdoor sculptures in Bucharest Category:Calea Victoriei Category:Trajan Category:2012 sculptures ","title":"Statue of Trajan and the She-wolf"},{"id":"35809952","text":"Paul Friedrich Wolfgang Mederow (30 June 1887 – 17 December 1974) was a German stage and film actor.

He was popularly known in Argentina by his byline, Caloi. Life and work Loiseau was born in Salta, and he was raised in Adrogué and Buenos Aires from age six. Adopting a portmanteau pseudonym based on his full name (\\"Caloi\\"), his caricatures first appeared in the popular current events weekly, Tía Vicenta, in 1966, and his first comic strip appeared in María Belén in 1967; both were satirical weeklies published by a fellow cartoonist, Juan Carlos Colombres. Loiseau's first marriage, at age 19, ended after two years. His first book, El libro largo de Caloi (Caloi's Long Book), was published in 1968, and in his first animated short, Las Invasiones Inglesas (The British Invasions), in 1970. Caloi was the chief political cartoonist for the news weekly Análisis between 1968 and 1971. He later became a regular contributor to the satirical magazines Satyricón (1972-74) and Mengano (1974-76), to the sports weekly El Gráfico (1976-82), and numerous other periodicals. His most enduring association, however, would be with the nation's leading news daily, Clarín. His work first appeared in the daily in 1968 as part of his Caloidoscopio series, and in 1973 he introduced readers to what became his signature brainchild: \\"Clemente.\\" The adoptive, flightless bird of a Buenos Aires tram conductor, Clemente became known for his fondness for football, irony, olives, and women (particularly \\"la mulatóna,\\" a voluptuous but staid Afro-Cuban character of his same species). Another recurring character in the series - Clemente's observant son Jacinto - was patterned after one of Caloi's own sons. A fixture comic strip on the back page of Clarín for decades, Clemente also followed ongoing current events and at times created controversy. The most memorable of these was a storyline around the 1978 FIFA World Cup (hosted by Argentina) that led to a well publicized dispute with a leading sportscaster at the time, José María Muñoz, and indirectly with the dictatorship itself. Throwing large quantities of paper confetti is an Argentine custom at the beginning of football matches and at other celebrations, such as New Year's Day. Muñoz and government officials sought to discourage this custom (which they saw as littering) during the event, however, while Caloi conspicuously supported it through Clemente. The fans' preference - and that of Caloi - prevailed when with the support of FIFA officials, scoreboard operators programmed a digital Clemente exhorting fans to \\"throw confetti, guys!\\" (Tiren papelitos, muchachos!). Authorities responded by instructing police officers stationed at stadium entrances to sequester newsprint from spectators or any other paper items that could be made into confetti; the fans' ingenuity ultimately made the remaining World Cup matches in which the Argentine team played some of the most confetti- strewn in local football history. Clemente and Bartolo. Caloi would find himself at odds with figures from the same dictatorship even after the return of democracy. An episode of his popular Channel 13 children's show, Clemente, was banned in 1983 by judicial injunction. The episode featured a storyline in which la mulatóna was kidnapped by a bat-wing eared vampire resembling former Economy Minister José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz (who sued for defamation); the vampire's ransom - 40 billion dollars, \\"plus interest\\" - referred to the foreign debt amassed during the conservative Economy Minister's tenure. Spun off from an animated special aired during the 1982 FIFA World Cup, the show introduced Clemente fans to other characters, notably the \\"Cameroonian fan\\" and his signature ditty: Burum-boom-boom. Co-written by Alejandro Dolina and Jorge Palacio (\\"Faruk\\"), the show was a success and remained on the air until 1989. Caloi remarried, and he and María Verónica Ramírez had five children. They enjoyed a good working relationship as well, and together produced his next long-running television series, Caloi en su tinta (Caloi in his Ink), which she directed. The program had a more cultural focus and featured animated shorts from around the world, as well as his own work and those of other Argentine illustrators. Airing on the state-owned ATC from 1990, the show received little support from the network despite earning a Martín Fierro Award in 1993 and was eventually withdrawn by the Loiseaus themselves in 1999. It reappeared briefly on cable television in 2002, returned to public television in 2005, and earned a number of awards. His other credits include scripts for the theater and advertisers; as a co-writer for Dolina's 1988 television series La barra de Dolina; as a jurist for numerous cinema and animation awards; and the lion emblem for Club Atlético River Plate. His works were featured exhibits at among other venues the Recoleta Cultural Center in 1987 and 1999; in Adrogué in 2000; at the Palais de Glace in 2004; and in Alcalá de Henares, Spain, in 2009. He shared the latter exhibit with his son Juan Martín (\\"Tute\\"), after whom Clemente's own son Jacinto was patterned, and who became a noted illustrator in his own right. Caloi also produced a traveling festival of animated film from 1999 to 2001 whose features were projected onto moveable, inflatable screens mounted in parks across the country. He had 40 books published between 1968 and 2008, of which 17 were Clemente compilations. He earned the Konex Award for his work as a graphic humorist in 1982 and 1992, as well as the Yomiuri Prize (Tokyo, 1984), and at the International Festival of the Humor of Bordighera (1994) among others. He was named an Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires in 2009. The noted illustrator continued to work despite declining health in later years, and on May 3, 2012, his sole full-length animated film, Ánima Buenos Aires, premiered. Caloi died five days later in a Buenos Aires clinic; he was 63. References External links * Lambiek Comiclopedia article.

Mexican officials stated that 49 people were decapitated and mutilated by members of Los Zetas drug cartel and dumped by a roadside near the city of Monterrey in northern Mexico. The Blog del Narco, a blog that documents events and people of the Mexican Drug War anonymously, reported that the actual (unofficial) death toll may be more than 68 people. The bodies were found in the town of San Juan in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León at about 4 a.m. on a non-toll highway leading to Reynosa, Tamaulipas. The forty- three men and six women killed had their heads, feet, and hands cut off, making their identification difficult. Those killed also bore signs of torture and were stuffed in plastic bags. The arrested suspects have indicated that the victims were Gulf Cartel members, but the Mexican authorities have not ruled out the possibility that they were U.S.-bound migrants. Four days before this incident, 18 people were found decapitated and dismembered near Mexico's second largest city, Guadalajara. The metropolitan area of Monterrey is an important warehousing center for cocaine, marijuana and other illegal drugs bound for U.S. consumers. The natural gas wells and pipelines running through Cadereyta and the U.S-Mexico border have also been the most tapped by thieves, supplying gasoline and other natural resources to Mexico's criminal underworld. Small towns, ranches, and isolated communities in Nuevo León have long been treasured by drug traffickers. The Mexican drug trafficking organizations have been fighting for the territorial control of the smuggling routes to the United States, and this massacre may be the \\"latest blow in an escalating war of intimidation among drug gangs.\\" The cartels also fight for the control of local drug markets and extortion rackets, including shakedowns of migrants seeking to reach the United States. In addition, the discovery seems to echo several other mass murder events where the drug cartels have left large numbers of bodies in public places as warnings to their rivals. The authorities have blamed much of the violence on Los Zetas – a cartel originally set up by ex-commandos that deserted the Mexican Army in the 1990s – and the Sinaloa Cartel, an organization originally headed by Joaquín Guzmán Loera (a.k.a. El Chapo), once Mexico's most-wanted drug lord. Background = Gang rivalry = Since 2011, Los Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel have emerged as the two main criminal syndicates in Mexico's drug war, with smaller gangs lining up on either side in a competition that now resembles a \\"full-scale war.\\" A string of mass slayings have convulsed Mexico in 2011 and 2012. Many of them took place in northern states, where Los Zetas have waged a war against rival drug trafficking organizations for the control of the smuggling routes into the United States. The Los Zetas gang dates back to 1999, when deserters of the Mexican Army Special Forces joined the ranks of the Gulf Cartel. Nonetheless, the two organizations split in early 2010, and have fought for the control of the trafficking routes since then. The powerful Sinaloa Cartel, the Zetas' mortal rivals, has stood up and fought Los Zetas too. Since late April 2012, Los Zetas has been under immense pressure by the alliance between the Gulf cartel and the Sinaloa cartel. In March 2012, thirteen Los Zetas' members were killed and dismembered by the Sinaloa Cartel in a turf war; Los Zetas responded in kind, killing at least 10 members of the Sinaloa cartel in their rival's turf. Much of the violence between Los Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel is the result of fighting over cocaine supplies from South America. On the supply side, the increased pressures on Sinaloa kingpin Joaquín Guzmán Loera, whose operations in Colombia in 2012 prompted his organization to grab larger shares of cocaine from Peru and Ecuador, threatened the supply-lines of Los Zetas, and triggered tit-for-tat attacks among both cartels. The Sinaloa cartel and Los Zetas are \\"regional and cultural opposites,\\" because the Sinaloa organization has been moving drugs north from the ranch country parts in Mexico into the U.S. for generations, while Los Zetas are newer arrivals from the more urban eastern coast. In addition, Los Zetas is a transient cartel without real territory or a secure stream of income, while the Sinaloa Cartel has a lucrative cocaine trade and the control of smuggling routes and territories. But the former are heavily armed, while the latter's enforcement arm is weaker. The Sinaloa cartel uses tit-for-tat attacks as a way of bringing down the newcomers; for Los Zetas, it is about maintaining their violent reputation – the organization's most valued asset. Moreover, Los Zetas pose a bigger insurgency threat to the Mexican government than the older cartels in the country because of the brutality of their attacks against the security forces, their disregard for civilians' lives, and their dangerous habits that go beyond the \\"unspoken codes of older traffickers.\\" The violent reputation of Los Zetas has made northeastern Mexico a no-go zone for many. Los Zetas, unlike the other traditional drug cartels, act like urban guerrillas; a police chief in Mexico explained how the Zetas would make anonymous phone calls to get the police out in the streets, block the road where the police were, and then open fire from all sides. In addition, the goal of Los Zetas differs greatly from other drug trafficking organizations in Mexico. Other cartels focus primarily in drug producing and drug trafficking, while Los Zetas often move into urban areas to diversify their criminal agenda and carry out a number of crimes. Their presence represents a new model for organize crime, unseating many older cartels with their brutal violent tactics that destabilize Mexico. The drug violence in the state of Nuevo León and all across Mexico has left more than 50,000 people dead since President Felipe Calderón took office in 2006. His military-led approach shortly after taking office spiraled the violence in the country, and has eroded the support of Calderon's conservative National Action Party (PAN), which did not regain the presidential seat in the 2012 presidential elections. The city of Monterrey was long been a bastion of the PAN, and the local business community has been \\"livid\\" about the violence in their city. Surveys showed that voters thought that the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which ruled Mexico uninterruptedly from 1929 to 2000, is likely to control and put down the violence. Its 71-year rule was \\"tainted by corruption,\\" and critics have accused the PRI of making deals with the cartels to maintain peace in the country. =Modus operandi= In the 1990s, the drug cartels in Mexico did not cut off the heads of the victims. Instead, they used different \\"codes of murder\\" established between the mafias. A bullet through the back of the head, for example, signified that the victim was a traitor; a bullet through the temple, however, signified that the victim was member of a rival drug gang. Now, decapitation is a tactic often used by the criminal organizations in Mexico—primarily by Los Zetas and its two main rivals, the Gulf and Sinaloa cartels. The first public decapitation was carried out by La Familia Michoacana in September 2006, when several gunmen opened the doors of a bar in the Mexican state of Michoacán and threw five severed heads on the dance floor. The practices of beheading victims in Mexico is believed to have come from Guatemala in the year 2000, when Los Zetas extended their criminal network into Central America and eventually incorporated with the elite jungle military squad known as the Kaibiles. The Kaibiles had been trained to intimidate the local population with beheadings during the Guatemalan Civil War (1960–1996). Others see the link with the religious cult of the Santa Muerte (\\"Holy Death\\"). Wherever it stems from, decapitations is \\"now a staple in the lexicon of violence\\" in the Mexican Drug War. Intended to terrorize the civil population and intimidate rival cartels, the public display of butchered bodies has replaced the traditional Mexican drug cartel practice of burying people in clandestine mass graves, as in the municipality of San Fernando, Tamaulipas. These new cartel tactics were used for the first time by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, an armed wing of Guzmán Loera's cartel, in September 2011 when they dumped over 30 bodies on a busy avenue in the state of Veracruz. Los Zetas, however, responded with their own butchery by leaving 26 corpses in the state of Jalisco and over a dozen in Sinaloa. These kinds of tactics are media measures taken by organized crime to solicit the attention of the public and their rival groups. In earlier instances, some of the victims turned out to be students, bakers, and brick layers—none of them with criminal records. In effect, anyone who can be abducted from the streets is fair game for use in these mass slayings designed to \\"cause terror.\\" Moreover, the new tactic of leaving huge body dumps may be used by the cartels to draw law enforcement into a territory to disrupt the activities of a cartel's rival in its home or disputed territory. The two-year rivalry between Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel has killed thousands of people since early 2010, and has grown increasingly bloody in recent months after the participation of gunmen loyal to Joaquín Guzmán Loera of the Sinaloa cartel. Guzmán, Mexico's most-wanted drug lord, has allied with the Gulf cartel to fight off Los Zetas and take control of their territories. The organized crime groups often leave multiple bodies in public places as warnings to their rivals; these criminal groups have been fighting for the control of the drug corridors to the United States, the local drug markets in cities, extortion rackets, and human smuggling. Violence has erupted in several parts of Mexico between Los Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel, who fight to take over each other's territories. =Cartels' retaliation attacks= On 20 September 2011, violence erupted between Los Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel in Veracruz, a strategic smuggling state with a giant gulf port. Two trucks containing 35 dead bodies were found at an underpass near a shopping mall in Boca del Río, having reportedly been abandoned there by armed men in the middle of the highway. All of the victims were alleged to be members of Los Zetas, but it was later proven that only six of them had been involved in minor crime incidents, and none of them were involved with organized crime. The Blog del Narco reported on 21 September 2011 that the message left behind was supposedly signed by Gente Nueva, an enforcer group of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the top boss of the Sinaloa cartel; However, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel also claimed responsibility, and announced they were planning to take over Veracruz. On 6 October 2011, again in Boca del Río, 32 bodies were found by the Mexican authorities in three different houses. Four further bodies were confirmed separately by the state government of Veracruz. The discoveries led to the resignation of Reynaldo Escobar Pérez, the State Justice Attorney General. One day after the resignation, 10 more bodies were found throughout the city of Veracruz. The Jalisco New Generation Cartel was also responsible for 67 killings in Veracruz on 7 October 2011. Los Zetas retaliated against their enemies in the state of Sinaloa on 23 November 2011 and left 26 bodies in several abandoned vehicles in Sinaloa. In the early hours of the morning in Culiacán, Sinaloa, they had set a vehicle ablaze. A dozen charred and handcuffed bodies were in the vehicle. At 07:00 hours, another burning vehicle was discovered in the northern city limits of Culiacán, inside which were four bodies handcuffed and clad in bulletproof vests. During the night, 10 more bodies were found throughout several different municipalities. As a response to the Sinaloa cartel incursions in Veracruz, Los Zetas carried out reprisal killings in the Guadalajara. On 24 November 2011, three trucks containing 26 bodies were found in an avenue at Guadalajara. At around 7:00 pm, Guadalajara police received numerous reports of vehicles abandoned in a major avenue with more than 10 bodies. Reports identified twenty-six victims as alleged Sinaloa Cartel members, and mentioned that Los Zetas and the Milenio Cartel were responsible for their massacre. Dismembered remains of 14 men were found in several plastic bags inside two vehicles in the border city of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, on 17 April 2012. CNNMéxico stated that the message left behind by the criminal group said that they were going to \\"clean up Nuevo Laredo\\" by killing Zeta members. The Monitor newspaper, however, cited a source with direct knowledge of the attacks stating the 14 bodies belonged to members of Los Zetas who had been killed by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, now a branch of the Sinaloa Cartel. Following the attacks, Joaquín Guzmán Loera – better known as El Chapo Guzmán – sent a message to Los Zetas that they would fight for the control of the Nuevo Laredo plaza. At around 1:00 am on 4 May 2012, nine people were hanged from a bridge on the Fed 85D in Nuevo Laredo. A banner left behind reportedly stated that those killed were the perpetrators of the car bomb in the city on 24 April 2012. The nine were reportedly members of the Gulf Cartel who were killed by Los Zetas. Several hours later, 14 decapitated bodies were abandoned inside a vehicle in front of the Customs Agency; the severed heads were left inside several ice coolers in front of the municipal palace. The Mexican police said the second massacre could have been an act of revenge by the Gulf Cartel against Los Zetas for the earlier killings. The decapitated bodies were found with a message allegedly signed by Joaquín Guzmán Loera, demanding recognition presence of the Sinaloa cartel in the area. In the morning on 9 May 2012, Los Zetas left the chopped-up remains of 18 bodies inside two vehicles in Chapala, Jalisco, just south of Guadalajara. Eighteen heads were found along the dismembered bodies; some had been frozen, others were covered in lime, and the rest were found in an advanced state of decomposition. The Mexican authorities confirmed that a message was left behind by the killers, presumably from Los Zetas and the Milenio Cartel. Investigations Matamoros reporting the killings In 2012, the state of Nuevo León and its surrounding territories have become a battleground for a brutal conflict between Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel, two drug trafficking organizations from northeastern Mexico. Reports of forced disappearances have not been uncommon in the past years. The municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez — a middle-class, industrial community where the bodies were found — is known for its broom factory, an oil refinery, and its historical role as one of the first places where baseball was played in Mexico. Nonetheless, it had at least five municipal employees slain in April 2012; just a week before the massacre, a military general stepped up and took over the city's depleted police force. In fact, the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez is under dispute by Los Zetas, the Gulf Cartel, and the Sinaloa Cartel; the area is a strategic point for human smuggling, drug trafficking, and oil theft. The municipality of Cadereyta is the most violent municipality in the state of Nuevo León that does not form part of the Monterrey metropolitan area. Initially, the Mexican authorities reported the discovery of 37 bodies early in the morning on 13 May 2012 in the town of San Juan, 75 miles (125 km) southwest of the border city of Roma, Texas. However, upon more detailed examination at the scene, the official figures reached 49 dead. The bodies were discovered on the Mexican Federal Highway 40 at about 4 am, forcing the Mexican police and the federal troops to close the highway. The victims were all headless and dismembered; none of the victims were shot dead. According to the testimonies of several civilians from San Juan, late at night before the bodies were discovered, a foul-odor could be perceived from a distance, but none of them imagined that the stink actually came from dismembered bodies. When the forensic experts began to pick up the bodies, they had to use facemasks because the intensity of the odor was intolerable. The Mexican authorities in the area had to cover their mouths and noses for the same reason. The attorney's office declared that the victims were dismembered to prevent them from being identified. Nonetheless, the victims are believed to be more than 25 years of age, and many of them had tattoos of the Santa Muerte (\\"Holy Death\\") – a female skeletal grim reaper – which could facilitate their identification. The bodies were taken to the hospital in the University of Monterrey for DNA testing and further investigation; dozens of military men were ordered to guard the surrounding area. Nuevo León's security spokesman said that the 49 people were killed up to 48 hours earlier at a different location, most likely in the neighboring state of Tamaulipas, and then transported by truck to where they were found. In addition, he said at a news conference that a banner left at the site bore a message with Los Zetas claiming responsibility for the killing. A large black \\"Z 100%\\" was spray- painted on a road sign close to where the bodies were found. The Mexican police have taken this spray-painted message as a reference to Los Zetas, which often leaves messages signed \\"Z\\" at crime scenes to intimidate both authorities and rivals. The authorities noted that there had been no forced disappearances in the area in the previous days, and so did not discount the possibility that those killed were US-bound migrants. Univision suggested that, due to the large numbers of people in this massacre, those killed may have been illegal migrants who were abducted from a bus in which they were traveling and then killed by Los Zetas for failing to pay the 'cuota'. The authorities have also not discarded the possibility that the massacre was the result of an \\"internal adjustment\\" between the Mexican criminal organizations. Javier Del Real, the secretary of Public Safety in the state, mentioned that the purpose of the massacre was to bring people's attention, \\"and it did.\\" El Salvador asked Mexico for the DNA results of the victims in Cadereyta to make sure if those killed were migrants from their country, but as of July 2012, none of the bodies have been identified. Aftermath Soon after the massacre, more than 50 police officers guarded the municipality of Cadereyta. And for more than seven hours, the stretch of Mexican Federal Highway 40 where the massacre occurred was blocked by federal agents and state police officers. The Attorney General of Mexico (PGR) attributed the escalating violence in the country to the criminal organizations headed by Joaquín Guzmán Loera (a.k.a. El Chapo) and Ismael Zambada García (a.k.a. El Mayo), who head the Sinaloa cartel; and to Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano (a.k.a. El Lazca) and Miguel Treviño Morales (a.k.a. Z-40), who used to head Los Zetas drug cartel. According to the Mexican government, the two cartels have committed \\"irrational acts of inhumane and inadmissible violence in their dispute\\" and have created \\"the most definitive of all the cartel wars\\" in Mexico. The Mexican government offers up to 30 million pesos ($2 million U.S. dollars) for information that leads to the capture of these mafia bosses. The Mexican federal government issued a statement on 13 May 2012 condemning the attacks. The Secretaría de Gobernación (Segob) offered its support to aid the authorities of the state of Nuevo León to find those responsible. The municipal authorities of the state were also asked to maintain coordination and work in unison with the Federal government. The Mexican authorities then asked the population to stay calm, since the massacre took place in a remote area and in the darkness of the early morning. In addition, SEGOB emphasised that as for the Monterrey casino attack and the San Fernando massacre, justice would be served. =YouTube video= A Blog del Narco article on 15 May 2012 pointed to a video recording uploaded on YouTube showing several members of Los Zetas disposing of the butchered bodies on the highway in Cadereyta. The video, recorded by an anonymous man who at the same time gave instructions to his henchmen, lasts for about 7 minutes. It shows how the bodies were transported by a dump truck to the area where they were found; once the truck stopped, several young men dumped the bodies on the highway one by one. Over the dark scene in the videotape, a voice was heard on the background yelling: \\"How many are left? How many are left?\\" Alongside the bodies, they placed a banner: ='Narco- banners' from Los Zetas= On 15 May 2012 Los Zetas allegedly put up five narco-banners from bridges or in other public places of San Luis Potosí and Zacatecas denying responsibility for the Cadereyta Jiménez massacre. Other banners were also put up in Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo. In the written banners, Los Zetas disassociated themselves from the slaughter in Nuevo León, and asked the Mexican federal government to conduct an investigation before blaming them. The banners suggested that the massacre was perpetrated by the Gulf Cartel, saying that Los Zetas would have dumped the bodies inside the city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas (within the territory of the Gulf cartel), instead of in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León, its own territory; Los Zetas, however, assumed responsibility for the 18 killed in Jalisco and the 9 hanged in Nuevo Laredo. The banners were immediately removed by the Mexican authorities. The authorities stated that they have not formally accused Los Zetas for carrying out the massacre, and that they only stated the content of the banners found alongside the bodies. It was later proven that Los Zetas put up the banners to confuse the authorities of their involvement in the massacre. =Arrests= The Mexican military detained eight Gulf Cartel members in the small, northeastern town of China, Nuevo León on 17 May 2012. Officials of the Secretariat of National Defense stated that the cartel members were captured during a military operation in the area in which cocaine was allegedly seized. The detainees were initially believed to have been involved in the dumping of 49 mutilated corpses in Cadereyta. The massacre was viewed as an attempt by the Gulf Cartel to stoke law enforcement crackdown in Los Zetas territory - a tactic known as \\"heating up the plaza.\\" Nonetheless, the Mexican authorities later confirmed that the actual perpetrator of the massacre was Los Zetas, and not the Gulf cartel. Elizondo Ramírez (El Loco), the perpetrator of the massacre After the discovery of the 49 corpses, the Mexican military implemented \\"Operation Rastrillo\\" to coordinate the regional commanders in the states bordering Nuevo León to seal and prevent the movement of offenders into other areas of the region. In Guadalupe, Nuevo León on 18 May 2012, the operation led to the capture of Jesús Daniel Elizondo Ramírez, nicknamed El Loco (English: \\"The Crazy One\\"), a member of the Los Zetas. El Loco was the leader of an important cell within the Los Zetas that was responsible for the massacre. According to the authorities, El Loco joined group of hitmen in 2008 that was looking to expand the presence of Los Zetas in Guatemala; during his time in Guatemala, he engaged in many armed confrontations with local drug traffickers, including one that killed Juan José León Ardón alias El Juancho, one of the country's most-wanted drug lords. He is also responsible for several kidnappings and assassinations in Cadereyta, along with the murder of the Secretary of Social Development of the state. The Mexican authorities confirmed on 21 May 2012 that Daniel Elizondo El Loco was given orders by Heriberto Lazcano and Miguel Treviño Morales to carry out the massacre in Cadereyta to \\"cause confusion\\" among the population and the authorities. Elizondo, however, disobeyed the orders of his leaders and dumped the bodies in the Mexican Federal Highway 40 instead of dumping them in Cadereyta's main public square, where it was previously planned. The bodies were transported from Los Herrera to Cadereyta, two municipalities between the city of Monterrey and the Rio Grande, and then dumped on the highway by Elizondo and 30 other gunmen. Upon the arrests of 17 May 2012, the Mexican military obtained information of the existence of five clandestine graves in China, Nuevo León. The five individual graves, at a ranch known as 'La Gloria' just on the border with Tamaulipas and identified by members of Los Zetas, were exhumed by the authorities. The authorities, however, said that the corpses found were \\"complete skeletons,\\" ruling out the possibility of them being the victims of the Cadereyta massacre. The bodies were calcined and in an advance state of decomposition. In the city of Santa Catarina, Nuevo León, the Mexican Navy arrested José Ricardo Barajas López on 3 August 2012, another cartel member responsible for the massacre. He is one of the 37 fugitives that escaped during the Apodaca prison riot in February 2012, where 44 Gulf Cartel inmates were killed. According to the Mexican authorities, Barajas López delivered the 49 alleged Gulf Cartel members to a man known as Tula, who forward the victims to Rolando Fernando Sánchez González, a former policeman and the regional boss of Los Zetas in Santa Catarina, for execution. Two months after the arrests, the Mexican authorities have not been able to identify the victims of the massacre. Hence, the bodies will most likely be sent to local cemeteries, although many civil organizations protested against this.

It was heard in the Appellate Division on 25 and 26 September 1989, with judgment handed down on 10 November. The presiding officers were Corbett CJ, Botha JA, Hefer JA, Smalberger JA and Friedman AJA. The case is especially important in the law of delict, in the area of causation and on the question of the remoteness of damages. An auditor was sued by a financing company for loss caused by negligent misstatements contained in a report by the auditor of a group of companies. This report was misleading: It did not give an accurate picture of the bleak financial situation of the group for which the company was providing financial facilities. The court found that the auditor had acted negligently and unlawfully, and so established factual causation. On appeal, however, it was held that the company's loss was too remote for the auditor to be held liable. The judgment set out the factors relevant to determining whether or not a loss is too remote.  Facts  The appellant, International Shipping, a company carrying on the business of financiers and shippers, agreed to make certain financial facilities available to the D Group of companies in early 1976. The respondent, Bentley, was appointed auditor to the D Group in November 1977. In March 1979, Bentley issued reports in respect of the financial statements of each of the companies comprising the D Group, as well as its financial statements, for the year ending 20 December 1978. In each of these reports, which were not qualified in any way, Bentley stated that he had examined the financial statements in question and had complied with the requirements of section 300 of the Companies Act,Act 61 of 1973. and that, in his opinion, the statements fairly represented the financial position of the company as at 20 December 1978, and the results of its operations for the period then ended, in the manner required by the Companies Act. International Shipping continued to provide these financial facilities until the liquidation of the companies comprising the D Group in April 1981. At the time of such liquidation, the total indebtedness of the D Group to International Shipping amounted to R977,318, of which only the sum of R593,826 was recovered. International Shipping thus sustained a loss in the amount of R383,492. In April 1982, International Shipping instituted an action for damages against Bentley in a Local Division, alleging * that the aforementioned financial statements were materially false and misleading in a number of respects; * that, in so reporting, Bentley had acted fraudulently or, alternatively, negligently towards International Shipping, which had relied thereon in reviewing and deciding to maintain and increase the facilities accorded to the D Group; * that, had the 1978 financial statements fairly presented the financial position of the D Group and its constituent companies, International Shipping would have terminated the facilities and have required the Group to make good its indebtedness; and * that the loss sustained by International Shipping constituted damage which Bentley was accordingly liable to compensate it. The action was dismissed by the court a quo.  Judgment  International Shipping thereafter brought the instant appeal in which the court held * that the financial statements were, to some extent, false and misleading; * that there was no reason for interfering with the court a quo's finding that fraud had not been established; but * that negligence had been established in regard to some aspects of the financial statements; and * that unlawfulness had been established in that it could not be said that Bentley had properly complied with his statutory duties in terms of the Companies Act. The only remaining issue was that of causation. As far as factual causation was concerned, the court held that the respondent's negligent report on the 1978 financial statements unquestionably constituted a causa sine qua non of the appellant's loss, since a proper and non-negligent performance of his duties as auditor would have obviated the appellant's ultimate loss. With regard to legal causation, the court held that there were a number of factors which tended to separate cause and effect in the instant case, viz * the time factor, in that two years had elapsed between the respondent's reporting and the loss; * the decision by the appellant to provide a support programme for the D Group at a stage when it already knew that the Group's financial situation was fairly bleak; * the fact that the appellant allowed the D Group's indebtedness to escalate; * the changed relationship between the parties as a result of the implementation of the support programme, in that the appellant and the D Group ceased to deal at arm's length with each other, and the appellant became intimately involved in the administration (or lack thereof) of the D Group; * the fraud committed by the managing director of the D Group, which played an important part in causing the financial loss which the appellant ultimately incurred; * the fact that, to some extent, the appellant did not rely on the 1978 financial statements prepared by the respondent; and, lastly, * the foreseeability of the support programme. The support programme amounted to uninhibited lending to the D Group without added security, which was the real cause of the appellant's loss. Such a situation was hardly foreseeable in March 1979. The court held, further, having regard to the above-mentioned factors, that the ultimate loss suffered by the appellant was too remote for legal liability on the respondent's part to arise. The appeal was accordingly dismissed and the decision in the Witwatersrand Local Division, in International Shipping Co (Pty) Ltd v Bentley, confirmed.

Created by advertising agency HHCL (Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury and Partners), a longtime collaborator of Tango. The advertisement was produced in 1991 and aired in 1992, and was the first in the brand's \\"You Know When You've Been Tango'd\\" campaign that would continue until 1996 before returning for several years in the 2000s. The advertisement features an orange man slapping a Tango drinker across the cheeks as a metaphor for tasting Tango, and was intended as a reaction against the norm of \\"cause and effect\\" television advertising at the time was largely focused on scenarios where people's lives were improved by the product being advertised. Orange Man caused controversy after reports of injuries when children began copying the events of the advertisement in school playgrounds, and was subsequently withdrawn, with two other versions of Orange Man replacing it, both showing different scenarios aside from slapping. Despite the controversy, it contributed to a boost of sales by more than a third, and has gained acclaim in later years, even featuring and ranking highly in several lists of the greatest advertisements ever made. A Channel 4/The Sunday Times poll in 2000 named Orange Man the third best advertisement of all time. It has also been credited as pioneering viral marketing and guerrilla marketing. Different commentators have named it the best advertisement for Tango and the best advertisement created by HHCL. Orange Man precedes other Tango advertisements that have caused controversy, and has been parodied several times. Plot The advertisement begins with three young men standing outside a fruit shop or cornershop. One of them takes a sip out of a can of Tango he is holding. The voice-over of \\"commentators\\" Ralph and Tony (voiced by Hugh Dennis and Ray Wilkins) appear. Ralph says \\"oh, I think we could use a video replay here\\" and the footage of the man drinking the Tango is \\"rewound\\" (with the visual effect of a tape recorded being rewound on screen) to some ten seconds before he drinks the Tango, for a \\"replay\\". Then, a man painted completely orange (Peter Geeves) comes onto the scene, who runs around the men and then taps the Tango drinker on the back. The Tango drinker turns around, and the orange man slaps him across the cheeks, and then runs off, leaving the drinker startled, although the other men beside the drinker do not observe or respond to the orange man and the slap. Ralph becomes excited as he reveals this to be \\"Tango taste sensation\\" and asks Tony to rewind the clip again to the same point as before, this time showing the orange man sprint out from behind a pillar box and shows the same events as before with Ralph and Tony providing commentary. The advertisement ends with the drinker looking at his Tango can in question, followed by a behind shot of the Tango can on top of the orange man's head, which bears the slogan \\"You Know When You've Been Tango'd\\". A deep male voice (Gil Scott- Heron) says the slogan at the same time. Conception and production =Background= At the time of the advertisement's production, successful soft drink television advertising was dominated by Coca-Cola; Trevor Robinson, co-creator of Orange Man, recalled that \\"Coca-Cola was the big name in soft- drink advertising then. Nothing was taking on the Coke ads; nothing came close.\\" Robinson recalled that \\"cause and effect advertising\\" was very popular in British advertising at the time, which he described as advertisements where \\"you come into contact with the product and somehow it changes your life for the better, was a big trend.\\" The most recent television advertising campaign for Tango at the time was a series of advertisements featuring the slogan \\"the whole fruit\\" that had aired from 1987–1991. These advertisements featured musical soundtracks throughout and lacked the surreal humour that would later dominate the soft drink's advertising from Orange Man onwards. =Conception= Britvic, who had acquired the Tango brand in 1988, were looking to radicalize Tango's image and advertising. They hired London-based advertising agency Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury and Partners (HHCL) to create a brand new television advertisement for the brand, which would form the basis of a new advertising campaign. HHCL, who had been operating since 1987, had earned a reputation in the business for breaking several norms in advertising and established an avant-garde theme in 1989, when, in launching the direct banking service, First Direct, aired two advertisements simultaneously on ITV and Channel 4, interrupting an Audi advert, one offering an optimistic and the other a pessimistic view, and a number of short, surreal spots in which the visual had little or nothing to do with the message. Orange Man was created by HHCL, using their staff Trevor Robinson OBE as art director, Al Young as copywriter, John Leach as planner, Axle Chaldecott and Steve Henry as creative directors and Matt Forrest as director. Production company Limelight also worked on the project. Robinson and Young were creative partners, and were \\"pretty anti-advertising in [their] mindsets\\" at the time because of their boredom and frustration with the industry norm of \\"cause and effect advertising\\", and were desperate to make a name for themselves after \\"spending what felt like eons trying to get into a West End agency.\\" Robinson said that the nucleus of their idea for Orange Man came as a reaction to cause and effect advertising, and that he and the team decided to focus on word of mouth as their media, which was a reaction to Coca-Cola's big budget dominance in soft drink advertising. He told Channel 4 in 2000 that the advertisement was \\"meant to be taking the mickey out of other ads that were on the television at the time\\", comparing it to coffee advertisements where \\"they have a drink and go 'oh, whoopy' and flowers bloom,\\" noting that Orange Man decided to \\"express this in an really OTT fashion\\".Channel 4 100 Greatest Ads, 2000. The idea for the advertisement originally started out as a joke, with Robinson recalling \\"We said how brilliant it would be if you had a drink and something shocking happened, but so quickly that nobody else saw it. We also had the idea that it was only when commentators rewound the film that you could see what had happened.\\" The idea to use commentators in the advert were taken from another idea they had for another advert, but they decided to mash the two ideas together, a \\"cardinal sin in adland.\\" One commentary considered the advertisement to be a \\"riff on the sort of sports commentary Andy Gray with his video tapes and ranty shouting at the time.\\" =Production= The project, including research, lasted two to three months in 1991. The plot of the advertisement originally involved the orange man punching the Tango drinker in the mouth, as they were trying to make the advertisement as \\"stupid\\" and slapstick as possible; before they then changed the idea to the orange man kicking Tango drinker up the buttocks, but both ideas were deemed too aggressive, so their final idea of the orange man slapping the drinker across the cheeks, described by Robinson as a \\"Morecambe and Wise-esque little tap on the cheeks,\\" was used. The team originally used American football commentators, but we were asked to make \\"everything more British,\\" so they hired English actor Hugh Dennis to perform the voice of Ralph and ex- footballer Ray Wilkins to perform the voice of Tony; Robinson recalled that Dennis' \\"Eddie Waring-esque commentary\\" was deliberately intended to contrasted with the \\"dry and amusing delivery\\" of Wilkins. Actors that were intended for the role of the Tango drinker were passed over as they did not like the idea of being slapped; the role ultimately went to an actor whose identity has not been discussed.ITV1's greatest adverts list \\"ITV's Best Ads Ever 2\\", from 2006 Robinson praised him, saying that he was a \\"really good actor, and he was just the best at reacting to being hit, he never made a big deal out of it,\\" calling his performance \\"cool and dopey.\\" The orange man was portrayed by serious up-and-coming actor Peter Geeves; the advert's co-creator Al Young recalled that \\"the guy we used [Geeves] was like a Shakespearean actor,\\" and noted that out of all who auditioned for the role, \\"he was the one who made [the creators] laugh the most,\\" adding that the way he ran \\"was surreal\\". Robinson recalled, \\"We knew as soon as he auditioned – the way he ran with his stomach sticking out – that he'd be perfect.\\" Geeves recalled in 2006, \\"I was asked to first of all run around, then run around and scream, then run around screaming topless, it was at that point I thought 'aye-aye, this isn't the normal run of the mill advert'.\\" The orange paint on him was orange grease paint fixed with hairspray, which took several weeks to remove after filming. Geeves himself was scared of hitting the finally chosen actor in the role of the Tango drinker too hard, though the actor did not mind, telling him a hard hit would \\"make it look real\\". Robinson and Young went to the shooting location–a park–to do a test film, which essentially involved them \\"mucking about, 'Tangoing' each other;\\" as they \\"messed around\\" they decided the \\"little slap\\" just wasn't powerful enough, so they exaggerated it; Robinson recalled that \\"if you watch the ad, the Orange Man's arms go way back before he slaps the person in the face.\\" Seminal American jazz poet Gil Scott- Heron was hired to perform the voice who says the slogan at the end because of \\"his deep, charismatic voice;\\" Scott-Heron was the first person to see the final advert, and, much to the relief of a fearful Robinson, he loved it. Broadcast and controversy Although Orange Man was produced in 1991, it is not believed to have aired on British television until 1992 on television channels such as ITV and Channel 4, where it became the first advertisement in the \\"You Know When You've Been Tango'd\\" campaign, which would continue until 1996 before being revived from 2002–2005. Orange Man was an instant success; Robinson recalled in 2015 that \\"I first knew the ad was huge when I fell asleep on the London Underground one evening. I woke up to hear a group of kids talking about and mimicking it. I wanted to go up and say: 'I did that!'\\" Nonetheless, Orange Man soon sparked large controversy in the media and in public after it was discovered children had copied the events of the advertisement in playgrounds and injured themselves; Rupert Howell, a Tango advertisement executive, stated in 2000 that Orange Man \\"sparked a playground craze\\" where \\"people used to go round sort of slapping each other and saying 'You've Been Tango'd', and it was all very entertaining and great fun. There were no problems until we got a phone call once from a surgeon who said 'look, I'm not the complaining type but I thought you'd like to know that I did an operation on a child this morning with a damaged ear drum, and I was wheeling him in to the operating table, and said to him 'what happened to you then?' and replied 'I got Tango'd.'\\" As a result, Howell pulled the advertisement from television that afternoon, although other reports erroneously state that the advertisement was banned. Orange Man was replaced by two similar versions of the advertisement, the first of these instead showing the orange man putting his hand on the Tango drinker's mouth and kissing it, and the other, which came later, showing the Tango drinker simply running off as the orange man approaches him. The former version was noted by Howell to be \\"just as good\\", although presenter Phillip Schofield comically noted in a later commentary that \\"happy kissing never really caught on.\\" These later versions were also changed to incorporate the recently redesigned Tango Orange can. Reception and legacy Despite the controversy, Orange Man was very successful at rising Tango's sales and profile, and sales of Tango Orange rose by more than a third following the airing of Orange Man. Such was its success that in 2001, The Daily Telegraph noted that the brand \\"eclipsed\\" the brand's better-known competitors due to the advertisement. The public received Orange Man with great acclaim, but regardless, at the time of its broadcast, television advertising tended to be very slick with \\"beautiful scripting\\" and big budgets, so most of the advertising industry did not enjoy Orange Man, with one of the big advertising professionals, who has remained unspecified, calling it \\"oik advertising.\\" However, HHCL \\"loved that\\" and felt they were brave enough to \\"do stuff that nobody else would do, or think about doing,\\" with Robinsion rhapsodizing in an article he wrote in 2015 that \\"I think that's what made the ad what it is. Now, years later, that's what makes my own agency what it is.\\" Despite the original industry hostility, critical favour towards Orange Man has increased in later times and has gone on to become considered one of the greatest television advertisements of all time by numerous sources; in 2000, Orange Man was ranked at number 3 in Channel 4 and The Sunday Times poll of the \\"100 Greatest TV Ads Ever.\\" Channel 4 aired the final top 100 of the poll on 29 April 2000 as part of their 100 Greatest series. In 2006, ITV ranked the advertisement ranked at number 5 in its list of \\"ITV's Best Ads Ever 2\\", a list of the top 20 television advertisements ever broadcast on the channel. In the commentary for the latter list, Orange Man is credited as a humorous precursor to happy slapping. Sarah McCartney referred to the advertisement in her 2011 book 100 Great Branding Ideas: From Leading Companies Around the World, where she comments that despite the controversy surrounding its slogan, \\"the phrase had captured the public's imagination.\\" In 2016, Ben Priest, founding partner and chief creative officer at communications agency adam&eveDDB;, included the advert in his list of \\"3 Great Ads I Had Nothing to Do With\\", part of a series for Campaign Live, where he said \\"the hype it created and the fondness with which people remember the ad makes it one of the most successful of its time.\\" In 2013, The Guardian referred to Tango as the \\"original gangster of viral marketing\\", saying that Orange Man \\"was all it took to engage viewers\\", and that no \\"Tango crusade since has managed to recapture that lightning in a 500ml bottle.\\" Marketing Society's website The Library states that Orange Man is the reason why Tango is included in their list of the \\"golden brands of 1992\\". Furthermore, Campaign Live stated that \\"no commercial better symbolized the creative iconoclasm of Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury during the early 90s\\" than Orange Man, and presenter Jenni Falconer said the advert was \\"brilliant, and everybody loved it and everyone thought it was great.\\" In Nicholas Kochan's 1997 book The World's Greatest Brands, he wrote that the advertisement \\"succeeded not only in entertaining its audience but also in communicating its taste attributes–the \\"hit\\" of real oranges,\\" adding that \\"the ad's fun scenarios of 'being hooked on Tango' have been extended into other promotions.\\" Orange Man is also credited by Curveball Media for pioneering what would later become known as guerilla advertising, with Tim Delaney of Legas Delaney saying \\"the whole point was that this radical, strong, full-of- attitude campaign worked – it shifted cans of fizzy pop in a way that got Britvic's rivals panicking. It also showed what potential there was in thinking of completely fresh ideas. And better than that – it became part of our culture.\\" Trevor Robinson told The Guardian in 2015 that \\"You can say 'Tango ad' to people and they still remember it. Some even dress up as the Orange Man today. That, for me, is what makes a piece of work great – when the general public take it on, play with it and it becomes theirs.\\" In the mid-1990s, Orange Man appeared on the brand's promotional VHS tape Now That's What I Call Tango 3, which contained multiple advertisements for the brand from Orange Man until the publication of the VHS tape. Aftermath Orange Man was the first of Tango advertisements produced by HHCL, who would work with the brand for many years after, and is now credited as the first of the brand's controversies, as later advertisements for the brand were also banned; in 2000 a \\"Tango Megaphone\\" advertisement was banned for fears it provoked bullying. This advertisement also had a replacement advert produced, the first time Tango had done this since Orange Man, although this was not an altered version of the original \\"Tango Megaphone\\" advertisement, but instead a short advertisement satirising the ban. Orange Man is considered one of two definitive Tango television advertisements, alongside St George, also produced by HHCL, which aired in 1996 in promotion of the brand's Blackcurrant variant, and is the only Tango advertisement besides Orange Man to feature in lists of the best television advertisements of all time. Orange Man was parodied in a sketch from a 1992 episode of The Real McCoy that also parodies the assault of Rodney King, showing the Tango drinker, an actor portraying King, getting assaulted by the Los Angeles Police Department after drinking a \\"Tango'd\\" can in his car, ending with the slogan \\"You Know When You Have Been L.A.P.D'd\\". Tango themselves later parodied the slap in a 1997 advertisement, Vote Orange Tango, which was a parody of a party political broadcast that was broadcast in the run-up to the 1997 general election; the advertisement sees a mock politician criticising the flavours of the drink that were not orange before praising the orange flavour, with a man painted orange later slapping the politician's cheeks several times with an orange fish as part of the politician's parade to celebrate the orange flavour. =Campaign= soft drinks market. Orange Man marked the debut for the highly successful \\"You Know When You've Been Tango'd\\" television campaign, created by HHCL throughout its first run, which would continue in its first run until 1996. Although Orange Man was the most notorious of the advertisements, other advertisements in the campaign also proved to be controversial and were banned, including Exploding Pensioner (1993) which offended pensioners and several charity groups such as Age Concern, Scotsman (1994)–which featured a legless, blue afro-sporting orange Scotsman–for scaring children, and another 1994 advertisement featuring a man's head pop off from his body, which was banned during children's programming for also being too frightening. Nonetheless, by 1994, the campaign had helped Tango double its share on the soft drinks market. One commentary later said \\"While it's a matter of debate as to how offensive these ads were deemed, as opposed to how good HHCL were at pretending they were offensive and exploiting the publicity, the phrase 'You Know When You've Been Tango'd' wasn't going anywhere for the next decade.\\" In May 2002, the \\"You Know When You've Been Tango'd\\" campaign relaunched with the advertisements Helmet and Porcupine on the tenth anniversary of the campaign and Orange Man, although this campaign was created by Chi instead of HHCL, who ended their ten-year relationship the year before. However, these advertisements were intended to hark back to the \\"irreverent orange hit\\" motif established in Orange Man. In 2004, the Pipes advertisement from the campaign, which drew comparisons to Orange Man in the media, was banned, becoming the last Tango advertisement to do so; however the ban was not because children had already injured themselves, but because there were fears that children were going to. In August 2006, Tango's main rival drink, Fanta, aired an advertisement with similarly saw a man being slapped, however unlike Orange Man it escaped being banned.

It was heard in the Orange Free State Provincial Division on 15 and 16 February 1968, with judgment handed down on 29 February. The presiding officer was Smit RP. The case is especially important in the law of delict, as an illustration of the concept of the nova causa interveniens. The plaintiff's leg had been broken in a collision, and he was discharged from hospital after the bone had clinically sufficiently knitted. Shortly thereafter, however, his crutches slipped on a smooth floor and the bone broke again. The court found that the fall had been caused by the plaintiff' own carelessness, and that the defendant was not liable for the prolongation of the recovery. The court also disallowed costs for the doctor's qualifying expenses.  Facts  In an action for damages for personal injuries which he sustained in a collision, it appeared that the plaintiff, a black man named Mafesa, had suffered a fracture of the right femur and tibia. After the leg had clinically set sufficiently, he was discharged from hospital. He had been given crutches to walk with, as his leg was still in splints. He was told not to place any weight on the leg, as it could break again. The next month he slipped and fell and again broke the thighbone. He had been walking on his crutches on a smooth floor when the crutches had slipped away from under him. He had known that the floor was smooth and also that the crutches were liable to slip, because at that time they had not had rubber tips. Mafesa had to undergo a second operation, and his recovery was prolonged for six months.  Judgment  The court held that the defendant was responsible for the damage sustained as a result of the collision, but that the fall had been caused by the plaintiff's own carelessness. The defendant was not liable for the damage caused thereby: The fall was an intervening cause which broke the causal effect of the original negligence. As no evidence had been adduced to show that the plaintiff's doctor had incurred special expenses in qualifying, the court held that plaintiff's request for his qualifying expenses should not be allowed.

Episodes Reception Reception for Golden Boy has typically been positive. On Metacritic, the series received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", reflected by a Metascore of 63 out of 100, based on 23 reviews. The Wall Street Journals Dorothy Rabinowitz stated the series \\"is packed with fine performances, but no amount of actorly talent could have done for this series what its intelligently twisty plots, its nuanced dialogue bearing a distinct resemblance to human exchange—even from the mouths of TV police detectives—has done.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the series \\"a solid, meat-and-potatoes police procedural, and one that could potentially evolve into more depending on how the flash-forwards are used down the road.\\" Newsdays Verne Gay called it a \\"decent cop procedural. Period.\\" He added: \\"The best stuff in Golden Boy is the little stuff—sharp, brittle dialogue, nice performances and a street cred that's a cut above average.\\" David Hinckley of the New York Daily News stated \\"We quickly care what happens to these characters, which gets any show off to a strong start. Just as quickly, though, the time-jumping makes the story feel more complicated than it needs to. Golden Boy doesn't need to be framed as a series of implicit or explicit flashbacks to engage us as an adventure tale.\\" The New York Times Mike Hale stated the series \\"is a smoothly made but entirely generic show that rides the squad-room-as-family metaphor hard.\\" DVD release The Warner Archive released Golden Boy - The Complete Series on DVD on August 5, 2014.

He is now remembered as a diarist. Life Oglander was born at Nunwell House on the Isle of Wight, the son of William Oglander of West Dean, Sussex. He matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford on 8 July 1603, aged 18 and was a student of Middle Temple in 1604. He was knighted on 22 December 1615.

He resigned in 1624 when he was made Deputy Governor of the Isle of Wight.John Debrett, William Courthope, Debrett's Baronetage of England: with alphabetical lists of such baronetcies In 1625, Oglander was elected Member of Parliament for Yarmouth (Isle of Wight). He was re-elected MP for Yarmouth in 1626 and 1628 and sat until 1629 when Charles I decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. During the king's personal rule Oglander was a firm royalist. He became High Sheriff of Hampshire in 1637, and was an energetic collector of ship money. Sir John Oglander lost his deputy-governor position, and was twice arrested by the parliamentarians during the First English Civil War, but was treated leniently in the end, in 1645. He took a concerned interest in the king's safety in 1647 and 1648 when Charles was in Carisbrooke Castle. Warned, however, of informers among the courtiers by Robert Hammond, he backed off. In 1650 he was visited by Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester and Princess Elizabeth; was arrested again in early 1651; and was again released on surety. Nunwell house, home of Sir John Oglander, 1988 Oglander married Frances More, daughter of Sir George More of Loseley Park in Surrey. He had four sons including William who was created baronet and three daughters. Oglander died at the age of 70. Diarist Sir John kept detailed accounts of his household and estate, which survive today. They are of particular interest because they evolved into a personal diary. These records were used superficially by Sir Richard Worsley, 7th Baronet in his History of the Isle of Wight (1781). An edition was published by William Henry Long in 1888, as The Oglander Memoirs.William Henry Long (editor), The Oglander Memoirs: extracts from the mss. of Sir J. Oglander, kt. (1888); archive.org.

Only during the campaign for the 1988 Venezuelan general election did the political space for the reforms appear. COPEI's presidential candidate, Eduardo Fernández, promoted the idea of reform, forcing Democratic Action candidate Carlos Andrés Pérez to address the issue. This led to an agreement between the two parties, and in June 1988 direct election of mayors, a law on fiscal and administrative decentralization to local governments, and a change in the electoral system from closed list proportional representation (used since 1958) to a mixed system was agreed. Implementation of the new electoral system was postponed until the following elections (in the event, the 1993 Venezuelan general election used a different system agreed in the interimPenfold-Becerra (1999:9)).

It was heard in the Appellate Division on March 15, 1994, with judgment handed down on May 16. Botha AR, EM Grosskopf AR, Kumleben AR, Van Den Heever AR and Mahomed Wn AR were the judges. The case is especially important in the area of delict, bearing on the question of the remoteness of damages and a plaintiff's impecuniosity. The plaintiff in this case had seen his vehicle, which he had used in his business as a hawker, irreparably damaged in a collision. In order to continue his business, he had hired another vehicle for three months, but had been unable to afford the purchase of another vehicle. A rule of English law has it that expenses resulting from the plaintiff's impecuniosity are in principle irrecoverable. This rule has no right of existence in South African law, however, as its rigidity is inconsistent with the flexible approach whereby a South African court will consider on the basis of policy considerations whether there is a sufficiently close connection between act and consequence. The impecuniosity of the plaintiff, the court asserted, is merely a fact to be considered together with all other facts. The reasonable foreseeability of damages is not decisive, but it can be used as a subsidiary test in the application of a flexible criterion. The court held that it is dangerous to attempt to distill fixed or generally applicable rules or principles from a process of comparison with other cases. In the present case, the court held that the plaintiff's conduct in hiring another vehicle was not unreasonable, having regard to the predicament in which he found himself; nor would it be unreasonable or unjust towards the defendant to hold him liable for compensation for such loss.  Facts  A bakkie belonging to Abrahams had been irreparably damaged in a collision with a vehicle driven by Smit. Abrahams had used the bakkie in his hawker's business. In an action for damages in a magistrate's court against Smith, Abrahams had claimed # payment of the market value of the bakkie; and # compensation for the rental (for three months) which Abrahams had paid for the use of another vehicle which he had had to hire in order to conduct his business. It appeared from the evidence that Abrahams had not been in a financial position to afford purchasing another vehicle, or even to pay the deposit. Smit's claim succeeded in the magistrate's court, and an appeal to a Provincial Division against the award of damages on the second claim failed.  Judgment  There can be no doubt, the court held in a further appeal, that in South African law the ratio of Liesbosch Dredger v Steamship Edison[1933] AC 449 (HL); [1933] All ER Rep 144. (regarding damages consisting of expenses incurred as a result of the plaintiff's impecuniosity) has no right of existence. The rigidity of the rule is inconsistent with the flexible approach followed in South African law, as explained in S v Mokgethi,1990 (1) SA 32 (A).39J-41B. in particular the flexible criterion whereby the court considers on the basis of policy considerations whether there is a sufficiently close connection between act and consequence.401I-J. There is no room for the employment of the ratio of The Edison in a system where legal causality is determined by asking the following question: Is there a sufficiently close connection between act and consequence? That question has to be answered on the basis of policy considerations and the limits of reasonableness, fairness and justice. The court found that the impecuniosity of the plaintiff as a joint cause of the damage is merely one of the facts which, together with all the other facts of each particular case, has to be taken into consideration in the application of the predominating flexible criterion (the oorheersende elastiese maatstaf)Mokgethi at 40D. in terms of which the court determines whether the defendant should be held liable for the damages in question.14E-F.15E-G. The question as to the reasonable foreseeability of the damages cannot, the court held, be regarded as the single decisive criterion in determining liability. Reasonable foreseeability can indeed be used as a subsidiary test in the application of the flexible criterion, but it cannot displace it.17E-F. The importance and efficacy of the predominating criterion in resolving questions of legal causality lies in its flexibility. Any attempt to detract from its flexibility should be resisted. Comparisons between the facts of the case which has to be resolved and the facts of other cases in which a solution has already been found, or which might hypothetically arise, can obviously be useful and of value, and sometimes even decisive, but one should be careful not to attempt to distill fixed or generally applicable rules or principles from the process of comparison. The argument that the plaintiff's claim should \\"in principle\\" be rejected was misplaced. There is only one principle: In order to determine whether or not the plaintiff's damages were too remote from the defendant's act to hold the defendant liable, considerations of policy, reasonableness, fairness and justice should be applied to the particular facts of the case.18E-H. The court held that the respondent had been placed in a quandary which had been caused by the act of the appellant,17B. and that the respondent's conduct in reaction thereto had been reasonable in all respects: To regard his shortage of money and consequent inability to purchase a bakkie as an obstacle to the recovery of his expenses in hiring a vehicle would be unfair and unjust towards him.17B. The period of three months during which the respondent had kept his business going with a hired bakkie was not unreasonably long as against the appellant: It was not unfair or unjust to hold the appellant liable for the expenses which the respondent had incurred during that period in order to maintain his income.17C-D. As a matter of policy, the damages suffered by the respondent should be the responsibility of the appellant.17D. The court held, accordingly, on the facts, that the respondent, having regard to the predicament in which he had found himself, had not acted unreasonably in hiring a bakkie for a period of three months, and that it was not unfair or unjust to the appellant to hold him liable for the compensation of the respondent's damages.20F. The appeal was dismissed and the decision in the Cape Provincial Division, in Smit v Abrahams1992 (3) SA 158. thus confirmed, but for different reasons.

The estate was built from 1992 and was originally named Brenthall Park, consisting of three developers in the Brenthall Park partnership who then sold on some estates to other developers. It was built over ten years by sixteen different home builders. The area prior to development was within the Epping district, an area cut off from Epping Forest District Council by the M11 and Harlow Common. The original marketing tried to compare Church Langley to a village, and this is still referred to in news reports and in social media. Harlow Council granted permission for 3500 homes to be built between the A414 and M11 north of Potter Street on the condition that the developers incorporate community facilities. Church Langley was named after two ancient footpaths. The estate was built on farmland owned by local farmers William and Jon Moen. They were unhappy with the result, having left the design of the estate to developers, calling it \\"dull, retro-style architecture\\" with poor road planning. They resolved to exercise firmer control over the Newhall development, also built on their land using the money raised from the Church Langley development. A concrete water tower is situated to the east of Church Langley and can be clearly seen from the adjacent M11 motorway. This was built in 1993–1994.

If the hypothesis is true and Helene, a daughter of Isaac and Kata, was indeed the wife of the Rurikid Rus' prince Yuri Dolgorukiy, then it may provide, through descent from antiquity, a Bagratid ancestry to numerous Russian and Polish descendants. Alternatively, Isaac's wife Irene may have been the same person as an anonymous daughter of Volodar of Peremyshl known from the Slavonic Primary Chronicle to have married the likewise unnamed son of the emperor Alexios.Magdalino, Paul (2002), The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos, 1143–1180, p. 205.

Another version given currency, among other scholars, by Cyril Toumanoff, holds that Kata was married to the megas doux Alexios Bryennios, a son of Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger and Anna Komnena. The third hypothesis, supported by Paul Gautier and Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza, states that Kata's husband was Alexios Komnenos, the eldest son of the Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos.

Former Players • Garry Purdham • Rob Purdham Challenge Cup history Egremont Rangers first formed in 1900 as the popularity of Northern Union rugby spread across northern England after its split with the Rugby Football Union. Egremont had a strong team early in its history as it twice qualified for the Challenge Cup in 1906 where they were defeated by Keighley and in 1909 when they were defeated by Runcorn RFC. This was a sound foundation for the club to build on to become a major player in amateur rugby league in Great Britain. In 1922 they added the Rangers moniker to their name just as the Northern Rugby Football Union changed their name to Rugby Football League. The modern era of rugby league was when Rangers were able to again qualify for professional opposition in the Challenge Cup when on 14 January 1996 they were defeated 58-6 by Leigh Centurions. It wasn't long before they had a taste of the cup again when on 13 February 1998 they beat Workington Town 18-0 in front of 3000 spectators at Whitehaven's Recreation Ground. The next round saw them being heavily defeated 84-6 by the eventual Challenge Cup Champions, Sheffield Eagles. 1999 was Rangers next attempt at the Challenge Cup when they were defeated by York Wasps. It was 2011 before they would have a chance to play another professional team, after dispatching local rivals Millom and Wath Brow in the earlier rounds, the travelled south to be defeated 60-24 by London Skolars. 2012 and again Rangers qualified for professional opposition when they took on and were narrowly defeated 22-14 by Championship One side Oldham at the Recreation Ground, Whitehven. Egremont were praised for their magnificent defensive performance in the News and Star. National Conference League Egremont Rangers were one of the ten teams that formed the BARLA National League (later renamed National Conference League in 1993) which began in the 1986–1987 season. Rangers remained in the top tier of the National Conference League (National Conference League Premier Division) from 1986–2000, where they gained one of their greatest achievements when they were crowned National Conference League Premier Division Champions in the 1997–1998 season. This period saw Rangers achieve two more major championships. In the 1988–1989 season, Egremont beat Wigan St Patricks 2-0 in the National Conference League Challenge Cup Final. A year later they captured the BARLA National Cup when they beat Saddleworth Rangers 11-4 in the 1989–1990 final. Return to the Cumberland League In the 1999–2000 season, Egremont's ageing core of veteran players voted to withdraw from the National Conference League and return to play their senior rugby in the Cumberland League for the first time in 14 years. This period saw many of the older players retire from the game, leaving mostly younger players to rebuild the squad over the coming years. The team played their rugby in the Cumberland League Division 1 and remained competitive although they failed to convert that into trophy success. Rangers twice made it to the Cumbria County Cup Final but were defeated on both occasions by Wath Brow (32-6 in 2000–2001) and Ellenborough Rangers (16-10 in 2004–2005). Rangers also made it to the play off final of the Cumberland League Division 1 in the 2004–2005 season but were again defeated 52-10 on the day by Kells. Under the guidance of their head coach (and former Workington Town captain) Gary Charlton and Club Chairman (former Workington Town ) Ian Hartley in the 2004–2005 season the young players voted for and successfully applied for the return to the National Conference League for the 2005–2006 season. Return to the National Conference League In the late summer of 2005 Egremont Rangers returned to the National Conference League when they competed in Division 2. They young side got off to an unimpressive start and for the first three seasons they finished in the lower half to mid table positions. It wasn't until 2009–2010 season that they started to seriously compete in the Second Division as a new generation of youngster entered the ranks of the first team. The 2010–2011 season proved to be when Rangers matured into a team that could seriously challenge for promotion, in which they finished narrow runners up to Hunslet Warriors and gained promotion to the National Conference League Division 1. Youth and reserve teams Egremont Rangers have a reserve team which plays in the Cumberland League Division 2 as Egremont Rangers 'A'. The main purpose for this team is to develop youth players in their transition from youth rugby to national level open age rugby league. The team is mostly made up by teenage players built around a nucleus of seasoned veterans. Egremont Rangers has a competitive youth system with teams in Mini rugby (under 8s, under 9s and under 11s) and youth teams (under 12s, under 14s and under 16s). The youth system at Egremont Rangers is the basis of Rangers open age squad. Almost all of the players in the open age squad have played at the club from the under 8s/9s/11s youth teams and every year a new batch of players emerges from under 16s with many of them gaining international honours in the years following their emergence into open age rugby.

The play is a realistic comedy and tells the story of a chance encounter between a young woman, Constance, and a man whom she mistakes for her ex lover, Bartlett. However, Bartlett is not completely aware of Constance's neurotic behavior until he gets to know her a bit more. Her true personality is only truly expressed after she forces Bartlett to stay with her in the hotel so she can pretend he is her former beau. Howell's uses comedy to reveal the deeper issue of the plight of unmarried middle and upper class women in the 19th century.  Act One: An Extraordinary Resemblance  Set at the Ponkwasset Hotel in Boston, the first act begins with Bartlett and his friend Cummings having a conversation about Bartlett's love life. Bartlett is depressed and has turned into a misanthrope because a girl he went on a date with was not interested in him anymore. As Bartlett is cursing all women and voicing his anger toward the entire female race, Cummings tries to cheer his friend up. He tells him the story of a girl who is still miserable about a break up that happened two years ago in hopes to prove to Bartlett that women do, indeed, have hearts. While they are speaking, General Wyatt, barges in yelling and cursing at Bartlett, ordering him to leave the hotel immediately. Then, when Constance and her mother enter the room, Constance faints at first sight of Bartlett. However, as General Wyatt approaches Bartlett he realizes that he has made the terrible mistake of yelling at a man he has never met before. Nevertheless, Bartlett is very upset and disturbed at the entire situation and storms out of the hotel. Cummings stays to speak with General Wyatt and realizes the general is terribly sorry for his earlier behavior. Once they are alone, General Wyatt tells Cummings the reason why he acted the way he did. Two years ago, Mrs. Wyatt brought Constance to Paris and Constance fell in love with an American man. However, when General Wyatt met the man he was very skeptical about him and soon found out that he was actually married. As a result of this unfortunate discovery, General Wyatt forced this man to end all relations with Constance, leaving her absolutely miserable and harboring a great deal of resentment towards her father, which has lasted for the past two years. Ironically, this was the same exact story that Cummings was telling Bartlett about just a few minutes ago. Although General Wyatt initially insisted that Bartlett leave the hotel premises to protect Constance, when Bartlett returns the general begs him to stay at Constance's request. Despite some initial skepticism, Bartlett agrees to stay.  Act Two: Distinctions and Differences  The second act of the play opens with Constance and Mrs. Wyatt having a private conversation in their room. Constance is an extremely dramatic young woman—she loves to cause a scene and is constantly seeking the undivided attention of all those around her. Like many other women in the late 19th century, she is primarily focused on getting married and starting a family. Before her relationship fell apart, Constance believed that the man she met in Paris was to be her husband and she had finished the race to matrimony. However, Constance still has not come to terms with the fact that her relationship with that man is over forever. She enjoys to pity herself in front of others and frequently tells her mother that she feels as though she is an evil vampire that repulses all men. Not being able to fathom listening to Constance's trivial problems anymore, Mrs. Wyatt shifts the conversation to the rift in Constance's relationship with her father. Ever since her father compelled her lover to end their relationship, Constance has blamed him for her misery and solitude. General Wyatt and Constance used to have a good relationship but now they are very distant to each other and Constance is extremely vocal about the resentment she feels towards her father. Mrs. Wyatt chastises Constance for her poor attitude towards the general, “How can you treat your father so coldly? Give me the pain if you must torment somebody. But spare your father, -- spare the heart that loves you so tenderly, you unhappy girl”. She explains to her that General Wyatt did what was necessary to protect Constance and she should have a little more self-respect to not be so miserable, as well as more respect for her father, her ultimate protector. When Constance is finally alone, she invites Bartlett into her room to observe and question him in an attempt to find any similarities, besides looks, between Bartlett and her former lover. At first Bartlett doesn’t realize Constance's intensions but once he does, he angrily storms out of the room. Bartlett and General Wyatt decide to go on a walk to the docks and Mrs. Wyatt comes back into Constance's room. Almost immediately after Mrs. Wyatt is with Constance, they see four men carrying someone up the hill through the window. True to form, Constance causes a huge, emotional scene. She springs up, exclaiming that her father is dead: “Oh, yes, yes! It’s papa! It’s my dear, good, kind papa! He’s dead; he’s drowned; I drove him away; I murdered him!” It's almost uncertain whether she was happy or sad at the possibility of her father being dead. Bartlett, witnessing this absolute hysteria, is very puzzled by such dramatic and preposterous actions by a seemingly proper young woman and questions his decision to stay at the hotel.  Act Three: Not at All Alike  The third and shortest act in the play is set six weeks later. Cummings returns to the hotel and to his surprise Bartlett has been staying with the Wyatts for the past six weeks. Bartlett, as usual, begins talking about his emotions with Cummings and admits to falling in love with Constance. However, aside from his love for Constance, Bartlett is secretly very offended by Constance's actions towards him—he has slowly become aware of the fact that the only reason she enjoys his company is because his features remind her of her former lover. Seeing that Bartlett is truly at a loss, Cummings advises his emotional friend to speak to Constance and profess his true feelings to her. When Bartlett sits down to speak to Constance and finally tells her that he has deep feelings for her, Constance immediately rejects him, putting on her usual melodramatic, self-pitying performance: “When he left me I seemed to die. Now I am some wretched ghost clinging for all existence to the thought of my lost unhappiness…I might have loved you – if I had – lived”. Annoyed with Constance's obsessive behavior, Bartlett confronts her of only befriending him as a way to pretend she was still with her former lover, which immediately sent Constance in a bitter, tearful rage. General and Mrs. Wyatt run into the parlor room as soon as they hear Constance's cries. At the sight of his distressed daughter, General Wyatt realizes that he must disclose a secret he has kept from her for the past two years. He shows Constance a note that her former beau wrote to General Wyatt, stating that he had no problem with promptly ending all relations with Constance. Reading this note and realizing that her former lover never truly loved her somehow immediately relieves Constance of all the woes that have been plaguing her for the past two years. Immediately all of her issues with her self-image, her father and her mother disappear. She turns to Bartlett and happily agrees to go on a date with him.  Characters  * Bartlett: Bartlett is the young artist who the Wyatt's mistake for the man Constance had an affair with in Paris two years prior. Generally, he is a very emotional man and has only ever been hurt by women, which has led him to hold a grudge against the entire female race. For a moment we see a shift in Bartlett's character as initially is not as attached to Constance as he is to most women—he is often very annoyed with her and doesn’t take to her very kindly. However, this developing strength of character is negated when he stays with the Wyatt's for the next six weeks and falls head over heels for Constance, despite her obviously using him to remind her of her former lover. * Cummings: Cummings is a minister in Boston and Bartlett's closest friend. He has heard of the Wyatt's tribulations with Constance because his cousin is in contact with General Wyatt as they served in the same artillery during the Civil War. Cummings is Bartlett's conscience and often acts as a therapist to his sensitive friend. * General Wyatt: General James Wyatt is married to Mrs. Wyatt and is father to Constance. He was a Civil War General in the 34th Artillery. General Wyatt did not approve of Constance's relationship with the American man in Paris and after he found out that he was actually married, he forced the man to end their relationship. This action caused a large rift in the relationship between father and daughter, and it's very apparent that General Wyatt is extremely sensitive about it. General Wyatt is a very passive man, but at times can seem overbearing. However, he does everything he can to make sure his wife and daughter happy and out of danger. * Mrs. Wyatt: Margaret Wyatt is Constance's mother and General Wyatt's wife. All of the Wyatt's children died during the Civil War so she, like General Wyatt, is very over protective over Constance. However, Mrs. Wyatt is very honest with Constance and is not afraid to hurt her feelings in order to make Constance realize how pathetic she has become. * Constance: Constance is the Wyatt's melodramatic and neurotic daughter. Two years ago she had a short affair with an American man in Paris and although the relationship ended as a result of his unfaithfulness, she is still very much obsessed with him. Constance has fixated herself on Bartlett because he looks almost identical to her former beau but besides looks the two have nothing in common, which proves very distressing to Constance. Due to the fact that General Wyatt brought on the break up, Constance begins to hate him and frequently voices these emotions to her mother. Mrs. Wyatt and Constance have a very good relationship, although at times Constance gets upset with her mother when she is being brutally honest. Constance is representative of the lonely woman who is fixated on marriage and motherhood because she believes that is her sole purpose in life. Her inability to fulfill these expectations is very stressful and has most likely caused her to become anorexic.  Major Themes  = Anorexia = Constance is referred to as a “ghost” or an “apparition” multiple times throughout the course of the play. Howells has most likely employed this characterization to indicate that Constance is anorexic. Anorexia is a disease that Howells held very dear to his heart. In 1889, his beloved daughter, Winifred, succumbed to the disease when she was only 26 years old and weighed a mere 79 pounds. Although this unfortunate event happened over a decade after the publication of this play, it could be speculated that Winnie was already showing symptoms, since anorexia was becoming increasingly prevalent amongst young women her age. Although some consider anorexia a “20th century disease”, voluntary starvation by women has been traced back to as far as the 12th century. Therefore, an anorexic woman in the 19th century was not as rare of an encounter as most people believe it to be. Before being diagnosed as an actual disorder, doctors simply assumed that a lack of appetite in a female patient was a symptom of a different ailment. Research suggests that anorexia “was not recognized as a disorder until it was seen in wealthier families that had access to healthcare”. The first diagnosis of anorexia came from Sir William Gull, Queen Victoria's physician, in 1865, which labeled the disease as an actual disorder that most often targeted females between the ages of 16 and 23. Girls like Constance, who were of the middle and upper class, often lived with their parents until they were married. Until these girls became the responsibility of their husbands, they were the light of their parents lives – especially Constance, who is left an only child after all of her siblings died during the Civil War. Parents treated their daughters as delicate and fragile beings that needed constant protection and guidance. Nevertheless, they still imposed a considerable amount of pressure for their daughters to marry and start families from an early age. This pressure often gave rise to anger and resentment in these women towards the stringency of their parents. Moreover, this necessity to fulfill their ultimate destiny of marriage and motherhood created a considerable amount of stress in the lives of these young women. All these emotions combined often resulted in anorexia or the development of other eating disorders. Constance, for example, feels a lot of resentment towards her father and a considerable amount of pressure to marry. Coming out of an extremely passionate relationship, she becomes a very unhappy person and feels as though she has lost control of her destiny. It is this loss of control that has most likely leads Constance to become anorexic. = Marriage = Constance is a young woman who is obsessed with getting married so that she can finally find meaning within her lonesome life. This type of obsessive behavior towards marriage was not uncommon in young women in the 19th century. The idea of separate spheres for women and men became very popular in the 19th century. This caused many middle and upper class women to find themselves stuck in an intellectual predicament since they expressed so much potential, but were perceived to be too delicate and fragile to take any part in the outside world. They spent many years achieving a high level of education, a privilege that prior generations did not have, but their social status often did not approve them getting employment like men of a similar status. Consequently, after these women completed their education, they had no choice but to wait for a possible suitor to come to them and propose marriage. Furthermore, as a result of the Civil War, there was a large shortage of young men of a military age, which was around the same age as marriage age. Some researchers argue that the loss of such a large proportion of the male population undermined the country's “established pattern of family formation and threatened the identity of white women as wives and mothers”. With the likelihood of marriage for women diminishing, more and more women became fixated on the institution itself. This fixation was expressed in actions like Constance's, where she has completely enveloped herself in the idea that she must find a husband immediately. Most women feared that if they remained unmarried past the average marriage age at the time, not only would they severely embarrass their families and themselves, but they also feared that they would never marry and thus never fulfill their ultimate destinies. = Father-Daughter Relationships = Through Constance and General Wyatt we see the evolution of a weak father-daughter relationship. Literature in the 19th century was frequently concerned with middle and upper-class family relations. Fathers and daughters often appeared in these writings and focused on the daughter learning to inhabit the role of a model daughter and wife. In one of Constance's therapeutic and emotional chats with her mother, we get a glimpse of what Constance's relationship was like with her father when she was a young girl. Like most young girls at the time, especially those with war heroes for fathers, she fulfilled the role of “daddy’s little girl” and truly idolized her father. The same could be said with the way General Wyatt regarded young Constance: he spoiled her, “took her everywhere with him, and wanted to give her everything”. In the Antebellum Era, daughters aimed to serve their fathers and practiced self-abnegation. Up until the incident in Paris, Constance followed this familial model, which is only conveyed at the end of the play when Constance instantly rekindles her love and respect for her father after he shows her the note. However, being the emotional, neurotic, attention craving young woman she is, Constance refused to listen to her father for the past two years, believing that he has severely wronged her. The tension between Constance and her father is expressed on many occasions. General Wyatt was truly trying to protect his beloved little girl when he forced her beau to end the relationship and on more than one occasion it is expressed that he misses having a good relationship with his daughter. However, Constance is incapable of understanding the situation in that context and openly admits that she no longer loves her father as she used to. Although Constance knows that her former lover was unfaithful towards her, she still blames General Wyatt for ruining her life because she feels as though he has destroyed all possibility for her to fulfill her destiny of marriage and motherhood.  Production and Critical Reception  = Adapted to Stage = A Counterfeit Presentment is regarded the Howells' plays to truly have a successful stage life. It was performed by one of America's most illustrious actors at the time, Lawrence Barrett. While financially successful for Howells, the play was not very well received by most audiences. Although most considered it a very likeable story, A Counterfeit Presentment was also found to be a bit boring, as it is lacking in much action. Audiences were also very surprised at the fact that the play belittles the theater at times. Critics point out that \\"when Bartlett is told the “tragic” story of a young lady who has come infelicitously to the hotel, a lady whom he is destined to wed, he exclaims, tellingly: “Oh, come now! You don’t expect me to believe that! It isn’t a stage-play.\\"”  About the Author  William Dean Howells was a very prominent and successful realist author in the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries. In addition to writing for the Atlantic Monthly and Harper's Magazine, Howells was the author of a significant number of realist plays and novels. In 1871, he was named editor of the Atlantic Monthly, a position that he maintained for the next ten years. The objective of most of his plays was to acknowledge and promote the importance of “little morsels of drama”. The communication between his characters is depicted in simple conversations, but with a hidden knowledge of each other. Howells became a prominent writer of dramatic realism in the United States between 1856 and 1916 because he created an intimate drama that was relatable and easy for the general public to understand.

It was heard in the Supreme Court of Appeal on 5 November 2008, with judgment handed down on 26 November. The judges were Scott JA, Farlam JA, Brand JA, Lewis JA and Jafta JA. JH Dreyer SC (with JA du Plessis) appeared for the appellant, and AC Ferreira SC (with I. Ellis) for the respondent. The case is especially significant for the law of delict, and the question of wrongfulness in cases of pure economic loss. The court held that the causation of pure economic loss is not prima facie wrongful. Wrongfulness is a function of public and legal policy considerations. The court went on to examine and explain the policy considerations determining liability.  Facts  Following a motor accident, a toll road had to be closed for 24 hours to facilitate the clean-up of spilt asbestos, which caused the toll company to lose revenue for the duration of the clean-up. The toll company instituted action in the High Court, in which it claimed its loss in toll revenue from the haulier which operated the asbestos truck. After a separation of issues, the High Court determined that the haulier was liable in damages to the toll company for its loss. In arriving at that conclusion, the court found # that the loss was not a pure economic loss; # that the question of a legal duty therefore did not arise; and # that the loss was not too remote for it to be considered to have been caused (legally) by the negligent driving of the haulier's employee. The haulier appealed against those findings, and the decision of the High Court, to the Supreme Court of Appeal.  Judgment  The court held that \\"pure economic loss\\" connoted loss that did not arise directly from damage to the plaintiff's person or property, but which arose, rather, in consequence of the negligent act itself, such as loss of profit, additional expenses or diminution in the value of property.Para 10. Thus understood, the respondent's claim fell squarely within the ambit of \\"pure economic loss.\\"Para 11. The court held further that the principles applicable to the element of wrongfulness were trite. They proceeded from the premise that negligent conduct which manifested itself in the form of a positive act, causing physical damage to the property or person of another, was prima facie wrongful. In contrast, negligent causation of pure economic loss was not regarded as prima facie wrongful. Its wrongfulness depended on the existence of a legal duty. The imposition of that legal duty was a matter for judicial determination, involving criteria of public or legal policy consistent with constitutional norms. In the result, conduct causing pure economic loss would only be regarded as wrongful and therefore actionable if public or legal policy considerations required that such conduct, if negligent, should attract legal liability for the resulting damages.Para 12. In a case like the present, where the claim for pure economic loss fell outside the ambit of any recognised category of liability, the first step was to identify the considerations of policy that were of relevance.Para 22. The first policy consideration was the avoidance of imposing liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class.Para 23. Following this consideration was the question of whether the imposition of liability would bring in its train a multiplicity of actions. The court would more readily impose liability where, as in the present case, the loss claimed was suffered by a single plaintiff, and was finite in extent, than where it would open the door to a multiplicity of actions.Para 24. Also a consideration was whether or not the plaintiff had been in a position to protect himself against the risk by contractual means. The court was more likely to impose liability where the plaintiff was \\"vulnerable to risk\\" because he was unable to protect himself against the risk of the particular loss by other means. In the present case, the respondent was \\"vulnerable\\" to the risk of the loss that eventuated, because it could not readily protect itself against that risk by concluding a contract with every user of the toll road.Para 25. A further policy consideration was whether or not the imposition of liability would place an additional, unwarranted burden on the defendant. In the present case, where the appellant's driver was already under an obligation towards other users of the road to drive with reasonable care, to hold him—and his employer—liable for economic loss resulting from his negligent driving would not foist any additional burden upon him at all.Para 26. The court held that, on each of those policy considerations, the appellant ought to be held liable; in other words, the negligence of the appellant's employee was wrongful.Paras 28-29. The court held further that the test for determining remoteness of damage (under the rubric of legal causation) was a flexible one. That meant that the existing criteria of foreseeability, directness, etcetera, should not be applied dogmatically, but in a flexible manner, so as to avoid a result which was so unfair or unjust that it was regarded as untenable.Paras 33-34. Each of the various criteria led to the conclusion that the loss suffered by the respondent was not too remote; furthermore, the conclusion that the appellant should be held liable was not untenable.Para 35. The appeal was accordingly dismissed.Para 36.

The book, in which Carnap discusses the nature of linguistic expressions, was a continuation of his previous work in semantics in Introduction to Semantics (1942) and Formalization of Logic (1943). Considered an important discussion of semantics, it was influential and provided a basis for further developments in modal logic. Summary Carnap writes that his main purpose is the development of a new method for \\"the semantical analysis of meaning\\", which he considers synonymous with \\"analyzing and describing the meanings of linguistic expressions.\\" He refers to this method as \\"the method of extension and intension\\", and explains that it is based on modification and extension of concepts such as those of class and property. He contrasts it with semantical methods that \\"regard an expression in a language as a name of a concrete or abstract entity\\", observing that unlike them, it \\"takes an expression, not as naming anything, but as possessing an intension and an extension.\\" He presents Meaning and Necessity as the third volume of \\"Studies in Semantics\\", which includes previous volumes such as Introduction to Semantics. In addition to discussing meaning analysis, Carnap discusses modal logic, describing it as his second main topic. The term \\"state-description\\" is used by Carnap to refer to a class of sentences which \\"contains for every atomic sentence either this sentence or its negation, but not both, and no other sentences\\". He considers the term justified because a state-description \\"obviously gives a complete description of a possible state of the universe of individuals with respect to all properties and relations expressed by predicates of the system.\\" The enlarged edition of Meaning and Necessity includes previously published papers replying to criticism of Carnap by the philosophers Gilbert Ryle, Ernest Nagel, and Alonzo Church. Publication history Meaning and Necessity was first published in 1947 by the University of Chicago Press. An enlarged edition was published in 1956. In 1964, a fourth impression was published. Reception Meaning and Necessity received a positive review from Marie Hochmuth in the Quarterly Journal of Speech and a negative review from Ryle in Philosophy. Hochmuth wrote that Carnap's work, like that of other members of the Vienna Circle, had \\"inspired the search for a neutral system of symbols, free from the dross of historical languages.\\" She credited Carnap with drawing attention to \\"the urgent need for a system of theoretical pragmatics, not only for psychology and linguistics, but also for analytic philosophy.\\" However, she noted that the first edition of the work had been criticized for \\"Carnap's claims for the simplicity and the scientific purity of his system.\\" Discussions of Meaning and Necessity include those by Carnap in Revue Internationale de Philosophie, the philosopher Nathan Salmon in The Philosophical Review, Bernard Linsky in History & Philosophy of Logic, Amélie Gheerbrant and Marcin Mostowski in Mathematical Logic Quarterly, and Juan José Acero in Teorema. Linsky suggested that Carnap had independently rediscovered points first made about logic by the philosopher Leon Chwistek in 1924. The philosopher A. J. Ayer considered Meaning and Necessity more important than Carnap's other books on semantics, Introduction to Semantics and Formalization of Logic. However, he criticized the work, arguing that there is only a nominal distinction between Carnap's view that linguistic expressions have intensions and extensions and the traditional view that they \\"name concrete or abstract entities\\". He also suggested that despite Carnap's claim that every designation refers to both an intension and an extension, his system \\"provides only for the designation of intensional entities\\". The philosopher Dagfinn Føllesdal wrote that while Carnap admitted that he ignored complications with his proposed system of modal logic, he failed to explain what they were. He criticized Carnap for this, and suggested that Carnap was unaware of some of the problems with his views. The philosopher E. J. Lowe wrote that Meaning and Necessity was \\"important and influential\\", and laid the foundations of much subsequent work in the semantics of modal logic. According to Lowe, the book was the culmination of Carnap's concern with the semantics of natural and formal languages, which developed subsequent to his publication of The Logical Syntax of Language (1934). The philosopher Henry E. Kyburg Jr. wrote that Meaning and Necessity provided the basis for a new form of modal logic. He considered Carnap's concept of the state-description one of his most important contributions.

V. Vereshchagin Mykolaiv Art Museum () is the museum of art, which is located in Mykolaiv, also known as Nikolayev (from Russian language), Ukraine.  History  The museum was established in 1914 by the members of a local society of fans of the fine arts, as a monument to artist, Vasily Vereschagin. The first collection of the museum was placed in the former guardroom of a military department. It included works which were donated by the Academy of Arts, Alexander's III Russian museum, and items which were sent by V. V. Vereschagin's widow, Lydia Vasilyevna. On the eve of the Great Patriotic War, the collection museum totaled almost 100,000 works. In the days of fascist occupation the museum was plundered. Restoration began when Nikolaev was released. In 1945, the museum restored the work in the small ancient estate. The museum includes works owned by V. V. Vereschagin, and works by authors such as I.K. Ayvazovsky, R.G. Sudkovsky, and M.M. Antokolsky. Other museums participated in the formation of a post-war collection including the Kiev museum of Russian art, the Kiev museum of the Western and Oriental art, and the Odessa art museum. During the 1970–1980 period, the museum's collection was regularly replenished at the expense of the USSR, Union of Artists of the USSR, and other organizations, as well as from private collections. Cannibal by V.V.Verschagin Letter to home (Letter to Mother) by V.V.Vereschagin From 1980–1990, special attention was given to the artistic traditions of the region. The Nikolaev organization of Artists bought the oldest works of the artists D.K. Krainev, R. S. Sokolov, S.M. Starcheusa, V.I. Firsov and others. Today Vasily Vereshchagin's Museum of Art has the most comprehensive collection of works by contemporary artist of Nikolaev: M. Ryasnyansky, V.I. Zolotukhin, D.A. Antonyuk, A.P. Zavgorodny, N.F. Berezhnoy, Y.A Bulavitskogo, S.F. Sienkiewicz, N.A. Mandrikova-Donchik, and V.S. Pokosenko. In 1986, the museum moved to a new, spacious house. There is an exposition of national art in the halls on the second and third floors including paintings, sculpture, arts and crafts and graphic arts. There is a separate hall in the museum where works of West European art are shown. The Russian Academy of Arts and the Charitable Foundation of Preservation of inheritance of V. V. Vereschagin awarded the museum a gold medal for restoration work of the artist, and preservation and promotion of the artist’s oeuvre in 2002. According to the decision of the presidium of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts, the museum was awarded a silver medal on July 28, 2009 for the promotion of art, for merits in aesthetic education of young generation, and in view of the 95th anniversary of the foundation day.

It was constructed in phases from the 2nd to the 5th century, and then abandoned. It was excavated in 1965–72. Nothing is visible at the site today, but finds from the excavations are on display in Winchester City Museum, and one wing of the villa has been reconstructed at Butser Ancient Farm. History The earliest known house uncovered at Sparsholt was a single-aisled farmhouse probably built in the 2nd century.Dominic Perring, (2002), The Roman House in Britain, pages 53–4. Routledge It may initially have been undivided internally, but by 200 AD it had been replaced by an aisled house with living rooms and a bath suite at one end.Richard Hingley, (1989), Rural settlement in Roman Britain, page 69. Seaby In the early 4th century a separate winged-corridor house was constructed at right-angles to the aisled house, and both buildings formed two sides of a rectangular enclosure. A barn-like structure was added on the third side of the enclosure.Guy De la Bédoyère, (1993), Book of Roman villas and the countryside, page 63. English Heritage The fourth side contained the entrance to the enclosure which was opposite the winged-corridor house. Tessellated pavements and mosaics were added to both houses. The last structure to be built, perhaps during the post-Roman period, was a timbered hall, outside the courtyard.Monument No. 231909, Pastscape This incorporated material plundered from the earlier buildings, but nothing distinctively post-Roman or early Saxon has been found on the site. Excavation and display Sparsholt Villa mosaic in Winchester City Museum The villa is located in West Wood, just west of the village of Sparsholt, Hampshire. Trial excavations were conducted in 1890 and 1895 which revealed part of the plan of the villa. Excavations, which were led by David E. Johnston, were conducted from 1965–72.David E. Johnston, (2002), Discovering Roman Britain, pages 61–2. Osprey Nothing is visible on the ground today. On display in Winchester City Museum is a near-intact 4th- century geometric mosaic taken from the aisled building.Roger John Anthony Wilson, (2002), A guide to the Roman remains in Britain, page 113. Constable Also on display in the museum is a fresco containing a female portrait within a tondo, which may show the mistress of the house. Another fresco is a painted version of a guilloché – a type of pattern common in mosaics but extremely rare in Roman frescos. At Butser Ancient Farm near Petersfield is a reconstruction of the aisled villa building. The building was constructed by volunteers and includes a functioning hypocaust system.

The project involves different disciplines, including mechanical engineers, electrical engineers and industrial designers. Eolian Eolian was the first Chilean solar car, and was built in 2007. The idea started with a group of engineering students who had previously worked on an electric car in a local race called Formula-i. The car is a tricycle with two fronts wheels and one rear wheel. The chassis is made of a composite with a core of balsa wood, the external fuselage is made of a fiberglass composite. It has 6 square meters of photo- voltaic cells, an induction engine with permanent magnets in the rear wheel and two battery compartments containing lithium cells. Eolian took part in the 2007 World Solar Challenge and finished in 14th place. Eolian 2 Eolian 2 in the Atacama Solar Challenge 2011 Eolian 2 is the second solar car from the University of Chile built in 2011 by a new team of students. The car has a similar basic configuration to Eolian 1, but with differences that produce a better aerodynamic performance, more reliable structural design and an improved maneuverability. One of the main innovations was the use of carbon fiber in the composite materials of the chassis, which makes the car lighter. Eolian 2 took part in the 2011 Atacama Solar Challenge race, taking second place and in the 2011 World Solar Challenge race, finishing 22nd. Due to the fact that the dates of the races were very close together, the project considered building two cars. The vehicle was divided into three pieces so that it could be shipped to Australia.

A native of Alberta, she has released ten albums, which explore themes in environmental, women's, and other justice movements. Her work spans several musical genres and often includes other artists, and large-scale multicultural events. Berezan's 1993 album, Borderlines, was nominated for a NAIRD Award for independent music. Life and career =Origins and musical beginnings= Berezan was born in Edmonton, Alberta. When she was in second grade, a woman selling guitar lessons gave her an aptitude test and convinced Berezan's parents that she had musical ability. Her parents enrolled her in guitar lessons. Her first musical influence was the 1950s music of her parents and later the music that played from her radio in the 1960s. In her teenage years, she began to write music \\"as an outlet for the emotional stuff that was going on in my life.\\"Mason, J.T. (1995). Biography. \\"Additional Biographical Information,\\" Harmony Ridge Music. Attending a progressive Catholic high School, her religion classes included discussions of music such as Simon & Garfunkel's \\"I Am a Rock\\" and this sort of introspective music influenced her. In 1978, in her senior year in high school, an English teacher introduced her to the music of Bob Dylan. Her discovery of Dylan, led her to rediscover the \\"60s experience through the music.\\" Canadian folk music at that time had its own set of introspective folk singers, such as Joni Mitchell, (also from Alberta), Neil Young, Ferron, Bruce Cockburn, The Band, Heather Bishop and Connie Kaldor, each of whom influenced her music. Berezan studied comparative religion at the University of Calgary. After her first year, she took a break to travel in Europe and had her first experience of playing in public on the street corners of France and Germany. She completed her degree at the University of Calgary while playing in her spare time at clubs and cafes throughout Alberta. During this period, she discovered feminism and liberation theology and began playing at political events. She also became interested in the treatment of women by the major religions in patriarchal societies. She became involved in a number of groups working for justice in Latin America and other solidarity movements, anti nuclear efforts, and feminist causes. Berezan moved to Oakland in 1986 to take a master's degree at the Institute of Culture and Creation Spirituality at Holy Names College. The school, run by renegade Catholic priest Matthew Fox, had a staff that included Starhawk, Luisah Teish and Charlene Spretnak. In addition to academic study, the program included experiential learning, artistic spiritual practices and political consciousness-raising. in her second year there, Berezan began to make connections in the Bay Area music scene and began playing at local clubs and restaurants. =Musical career= Berezan's 1988 debut album In the Eye of The Storm was an early example of a musical style that has come to be called \\"Americana.\\" Her more rock-oriented Borderlines was nominated for a 1993 NAIRD Award (the Grammy of the indie record industry). She Carries Me (1995) marked the beginning of Berezan’s journey into the realm of meditative and trance music. The album featured Olympia Dukakis in a spoken word part. Refuge (1997) combined acoustic arrangements with personal themes.Jennifer Berezan Biography. In 2000, Berezan released Returning, a cross-cultural work using chants. This was her first work to create a long playing, layered composition. It was recorded in Malta in a 6000-year-old temple with an oracular underground sound chamber. Praises for the World (2002), featured Alice Walker and singers from various cultural and spiritual traditions. It developed into a large-scale theatrical production with nearly 60 musicians, dancers, poets, actors and activists. Other guest artists included Gloria Steinem, Olympia Dukakis, Eve Ensler, Wilma Mankiller, and Tuck and Patti. The individual performances have been used for fundraisers and educational events for various causes. The acoustic End of Desire, in 2005, showed Berezan's wide-ranging musical influences and interests. It included folk, rock, chant and pop with Buddhist themes, love songs, and works about the struggle for global justice. It includes vocal appearances by Bruce Cockburn and Emily Saliers of Indigo Girls. In 2011, Berezan released In these Arms, A Song for all Beings, a long-playing musical meditation based on two of the Buddhist \\"sublime attitudes,\\" loving kindness and compassion. In Korea, Berezan and co-producer Don Benedictson recorded 250 Buddhist nuns from Un-munsa monastery. The nun's chants are inter-mixed with voices from around the world, including Dechen Shak-Dagsay (Tibet), Rita Sahai (India), Katia Cardenal (Nicaragua), Buddhist teacher Jack Kornfield and others. Her recent release \\"Home\\" continues her mix of music and a collection of musical friends with themes that focus on \\"home as everywhere\\"—California, Beijing, the Yukon and the \\"internal realms of the heart.\\" Musical style and reception Berezan's work spans musical styles and crosses artistic boundaries, blurring the distinctions between music, politics, and spirituality. While her songs often confront universal issues, her perspective is personal and reflects her upbringing in the prairies of Alberta and the transformative power of nature. She is known as a producer of large scale multicultural ecstatic musical events. Her \\"sprawling multimedia happenings\\" have gained her a loyal following. These \\"Praises for the World,\\" events may involve as many as sixty musicians, dancers, poets, actors, activists and spiritual leaders.

She was launched as Isle of Gigha in May 1966. On 11 November 1966, she capsized off Islay. Salvaged, overhauled, and renamed, she provided thirty years of service between Islay and Jura. History Oban civil engineer and merchant seaman John Rose and Gavin Hamilton, a Lanarkshire landscape gardener recognised that the future of inter-island ferry trade was for freight to be carried by lorries loaded onto a ro-ro ship. This was not being developed by Caledonian MacBrayne. The pair obtained a grant from the Highlands and Islands Development Board and ordered a landing craft type ferry from the Thames Launch Works, who subcontracted work to Bideford Shipyard. In February 1966, with Chris Pollock, an Argyll businessman, they formed Eilean Sea Services. Building progressed rapidly. The ferry was launched as Isle of Gigha and handed over to the owners in May 1966, despite problems with the performance and stability trials. She completed her delivery voyage from Bideford to Loch Sween without event. In service, beach landings, sometimes in gale force winds, took a heavy toll on the hull, resulting in shell fractures and jamming of the port rudder. Water leaked into the after-peak and the engine room. =Capsize= On the morning of 11 November 1966, Isle of Gigha was en route from Gigha to Port Ellen, loaded with commercial vehicles. Rolling in a moderate sea, a rudder stock cracked making steering difficult. Unsecured loads shifted, causing the ferry to list and capsize. , , and the Islay lifeboat took part in the rescue, but three men were lost. That afternoon, Admiralty salvage vessel Succour secured a tow. The righted casualty was taken to Greenock. Realising that the future safety of such roll-on/roll-off ferries depended on identifying the causes of the accident, Board of Trade Inspector, Walter Weyndling, mounted a newspaper campaign to hold a Court of Inquiry. The Inquiry was held and blamed the master, Gordon Graham, for not securing the vehicles. The managers of the Eilean Sea Services and the contractors escaped. The salvaged vessel was returned to Eilean Sea Services. John Rose had formed Western Ferries with investment from many commercial interests in Islay and Jura. They bought the Isle of Gigha and had additional buoyancy fitted at overhaul, increasing her range of stability. She re-emerged as Sound of Gigha. Layout Isle of Gigha was an landing craft – a square pontoon with shaped bow and stern. Service Isle of Gigha arrived in the middle of the nationwide seamen's strike and quickly found herself busy running emergency supplies to the islands. In the summer of 1966 she operated mainly between West Loch Tarbert or Tayinloan and Gigha or Islay. The refurbished Sound of Gigha operated to the nearer Western Isles, until the larger Sound of Islay was built at Ferguson Brothers in Port Glasgow. She then provided the ferry service between Islay and Jura from March 1969 until July 1998. During this time, Arthur MacEachern was skipper of the Jura ferry, continuing on the replacement vessel, until he retired in 2005.

Pre-Crashdïet Details of Cruz's early life, such as his childhood are virtually unknown.. At some point in his twenties Cruz lived in London, England, which he has cited as the reason he has a British accent. Simon was in several bands prior to Crashdïet: Foxey, T.I.T.S., and most notably Jailbait . In previous bands Cruz went by the aliases of Zymon Xaint , and Zimmy South. Crashdïet When Crashdïet auditioned people to replace their original lead singer Dave Lepard after his death in January 2006, Cruz was their top choice. Cruz, however, decided to continue with his band Jailbait, causing Crashdïet to go with H. Olliver Twisted as their new lead singer. Upon H.

Activist interview include representatives from the many arts organizations that have alerted the public to the crisis through performance art, music, theater and literature. Even with the gentler voices, the film's undercurrent is an angry demand for action and recognition. Artist David Wojnarowicz appears shaking with anger as he confronts the diseased society that has turned its back on him and all other AIDS victims. He reads several angry tirades and provides experimental film material and paintings. Painter Rafael Gamba provides a vengeful indictment of homophobic bigotry. Other segments include Keith Haring. He is seen working on a complicated erotic mural, commenting that the painting is \\"about nostalgia. It's not about anything that could happen now\\". Haring shares his nostalgic longing for the days of carefree sex. He died from AIDS-related complications on February 16, 1990, three months before the movie was released on May 4, which would have been his 32nd birthday. Allen Ginsberg's segment muses on sexual experimentation and attitudes, and declares that the planet itself has AIDS.

Career He was born in the parish of Bondleigh, Devon, the son of a small farmer. At the age of 10 he was working as a servant, then for seven years was apprenticed to a miller at North Tawton. He was then appointed manager of a steam mill in Bideford, Devon and in 1836 owned his own mill at Monkleigh, some 6 km to the south. On the suggestion of his brothers, who had emigrated earlier, he, his wife and four children, left for Australia on the Lysander, arriving at Port Adelaide on 6 September 1840.Dianne Cummings, Lysander 1840, Pioneers And Settlers Bound For South Australia, State Library of South Australia, retrieved 26 March 2016 He found employment with Borrow & Goodiar, then purchased land near his brother's property at Hay Valley (near Nairne), which he farmed and in 1842 built a windmill for grinding flour, possibly the first in Australia. The variability of wind in the area limited its usefulness, particularly as he had built the windmill with a fixed mechanism, and the angle of the sails could not be changed to match wind direction, and he ordered a small steam engine from England. While waiting for its arrival he worked for Ridley, helping to construct his famous reaper, proving its performance on D. McFarlane's land at Mount Barker. For a time he managed the South Australian Company's first steam mill in Adelaide, which had been set up by William Randell. His first steam mill, in Mount Barker, began working in 1844, the second steam mill in Australia at a time when South Australia was the only wheat producing colony in Australia. Soon Ridley's, Hart's, Magarey's, and other brands of flour were exported to the other colonies, then overseas. Dunn's milling and grain business grew until the firm had eleven steam flour mills, five fitted with more modern roller machinery. Dunn's first steam mill was decommissioned as a flour mill by 1899, converted to become ancillary to leather production. Dunn admitted his two sons into partnership as well as his son-in-law W. Hill, and his brother-in-law G. Shorney. W. H. Dunn left in approximately 1875 to farm in the North, and the remaining partnership was continued until the death of Hill in 1885 and Shorney in 1891. John Dunn retired from the business in 1889, leaving John Dunn, jr., as head of the firm. Politics *He was on the District Council of Mount Barker as its chairman. *On 9 March 1857 he was elected to the first Legislative Assembly with F. E. H. W. Krichauff as partner. Krichauff resigned on 12 March 1858 and was replaced with William Rogers. *He was elected to the second Parliament on 27 April 1860 partnered with B. T. Finniss. *He was elected to the third Parliament on 24 November 1862 with Mr. Allan McFarlane (– March 1864) as junior member. William Rogers was McFarlane's replacement. *He was elected to the fourth Parliament, assembled 31 March 1865 with James Rankine. This parliament was dissolved on 26 March 1868 and Dunn was beaten in the election of the fifth Parliament by John Cheriton. On 12 August however a fresh election was called by the Court of Disputed Returns and Dunn was elected along with Cheriton. This did not last long however, as Dunn was accused of paying the travel expenses of some electors, a charge which he vehemently denied, and was unseated. *He was elected to the Legislative Council on 19 March 1869 along with John Baker, J. H. Barrow, T. English, Sir William Milne, A. B. Murray and Augustine Stow. He retired on 2 February 1877. Church John Dunn was a member of the Wesleyan Methodist Church, and paid for the construction of the church building in Mount Barker which bears his name, opened in September 1884. He also paid for the construction of several rows of houses for the benefit of the valetudinary elderly of the district. Philanthropy He gave to the people of Mount Barker the \\"Dunn Memorial Church\\" which was opened in September 1884, and \\"Dunn Park\\" on the occasion of his 90th birthday. He died with an estate of around £100,000 with substantial bequests to a large number of charities, many associated with the Methodist Church and Prince Alfred College.

It is owned by the National Gallery in London as part of the Lane Bequest but is displayed alternately in London and at the Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane. From May 2013 to 2019, it returned to Dublin for a six-year period.Irish Times It is now in the National Gallery London. Development Renoir began the painting in about 1880-81, using the loose brushwork with dark and bright tones typical of the Impressionist movement. In about 1885, after losing his attachment to Impressionism and drawing inspiration from classical art he had seen in Italy and the works of Ingres and Cézanne, he reworked parts of the painting, particularly the principal female figure to the left of the frame, in a more classical linear style using more muted colours, and added the background and the umbrellas themselves. X-ray photography has shown that the clothing of the female figure was originally different: she wore a hat and her dress had horizontal rows of frills, with white lace at its cuffs and collar, suggesting that she was middle class, whereas the simpler clothes in the revised painting mark her out as a member of the working class, a grisette not a bourgeoise. The x-ray analysis and then the changing fashions allow the periods of work to be dated with reasonable accuracy. Description The painting measures high by wide. It depicts a busy street scene in Paris, with most of the people depicted using umbrellas against the rain. To the right, a mother looks down at her daughters, each fashionably dressed in the styles of 1881 for the afternoon promenade. She largely conceals a female figure at the centre of the frame, caught in the act of raising or lowering her umbrella, suggesting that the rain is about to start or stop. The principal female figure to the left of the frame, a milliner's assistant or modiste modelled by Renoir's lover and frequent subject Suzanne Valadon, holds up her skirt against the mud and water on the road as she carries a hatbox, but has no hat, raincoat or umbrella. A vigorous young bearded gentleman seems to be about to engage her, perhaps to offer her shelter under his umbrella. She, and one of the two girls to the right with a hoop and stick, look out at the viewer, while most of the other people go about their business. Unconventionally, the focus of the painting is not at its centre, and many of the figures are cut off by the frame as if the painting were a photograph. The composition appears natural, but the angles of the umbrellas are carefully arranged to form geometric shapes, with the main figure's bandbox and the girl's hoop adding rounded elements. The colours are largely blues and greys: a pattern of umbrella canopies across the top of the painting, and the dresses and coats of the people lower down. Material analysis The pigment analysis of Renoir's The Umbrellas conducted by the scientists at the National Gallery in LondonRoy, A., Billinge, R., Riopelle, C. \\"Renoir's 'Umbrellas' Unfurled Again\\". National Gallery Technical Bulletin Vol 33, pp 73–81. 2012 confirmed the assumption that it was painted in two distinct stages as mentioned above. In the dress of the woman on the left two layers have been identified: the lower layer contains cobalt blue mixed with zinc yellow and red lake. This is a similar pigment mixture as used for the woman on the right and her two daughters. Both layers have been painted during the first phase in 1881. The upper layer of the dress of the woman on the right painted during the second stage in 1886 contains a mixture of ultramarine with other pigments with a distinctly less vivid grayish-blue color.Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 'The Umbrellas', Colourlex Provenance Renoir did not exhibit The Umbrellas straight away – he may have thought the combination of styles would be too challenging for the public – and he eventually sold the painting to the French art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel in 1892. He sold it to Sir Hugh Lane, who died in the sinking of the RMS Lusitania in 1915 and left this and other paintings to the Tate Gallery in London in his will. It came into the possession of the gallery in 1917 (although a signed codicil suggested that Lane had changed his mind before his death, and would have preferred the paintings to be displayed in Dublin. The codicil however was not countersigned and therefore contested as having not been witnessed). It was transferred to the National Gallery in 1935, but an agreement was reached in 1959 to alternate its display (with seven other paintings from the Lane Bequest) between London and Dublin. Exceptionally, it was loaned for an exhibition at the Frick Collection in New York in 2013.

Written by Leonard Chang and series creator Kyle Killen, \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\" earned a Nielsen rating of 0.9, being watched by 2.51 million viewers upon its initial broadcast in the United States. Directed by recurring guest actress Laura Innes, the episode generally received positive reviews, with many critics claiming that it was the best episode of the series since \\"Pilot\\" and that Jason Isaacs' performance deserved an Emmy Award. Awake centers on Michael Britten (Isaacs), a detective living in two separate realities after a car crash. In one reality, in which he wears a red wristband, his wife Hannah Britten (Laura Allen) survived the collision, and in another reality, in which he wears a green wristband, his son Rex Britten (Dylan Minnette) survived. In this episode, Michael passes out during a bungee jump while he is at a carnival with Rex and Emma (Daniela Bobadilla). He is unable to switch realities, consistently hallucinates and realizes that Ed Hawkins (Kevin Weisman), a detective who is working with Michael's former partner Bird (Steve Harris), was attempting to kill him in the crash. Meanwhile, Hannah deals with Emma's new baby by trying to convince her parents to let her keep the baby. Shortly after this episode was broadcast, NBC announced their decision to cancel Awake, due to declining ratings, although NBC still decided to air the remaining two episodes in the show's original time slot. Isaacs found \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\" the most difficult to shoot, and had to imagine an awful thing happening to his family. It was filmed in Los Angeles, California, and continued and introduced key thematic elements to the series.  Plot  = Background = The Brittens are involved in a fatal car crash. As a result, Michael Britten, a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) detective, begins to live in two separate realities. In one reality, in which he wears a red wristband, his wife Hannah Britten (Laura Allen) survives the crash, and in the other reality, in which he wears a green wristband, his son Rex Britten (Dylan Minnette) survives. Michael does not know which reality is real, and uses the wristbands to differentiate the two. Michael sees two separate therapists: Dr. Jonathan Lee (BD Wong) in the \\"red reality\\", and Dr. Judith Evans (Cherry Jones) in the \\"green reality\\". Meanwhile, in the \\"red reality\\", Michael and Hannah continue with their plan to move to Oregon. Michael works with Detective Isaiah \\"Bird\\" Freeman (Steve Harris) in the \\"green reality\\" and with Detective Efrem Vega (Wilmer Valderrama) in the \\"red reality\\" after the collision. = Events = Dr. Lee asks Michael about his latest experience with the \\"green reality\\". At a police carnival at an amusement park, Emma (Daniela Bobadilla), Rex's girlfriend, asks if she and Rex can bungee jump. As they are walking to the ride, Michael bumps into someone who claims that it was his fault. At the ride, Michael goes first, but the person in charge of the ride seems concerned about something; Michael passes out and wakes up in the \\"red reality\\" (where Hannah is alive, but Rex is dead), as if the \\"green reality\\" were a dream. In the \\"red reality\\", Dr. Lee says it is progress, that Michael is trying to tell himself that his son is dead and that he is on the verge of a breakthrough. Shortly after getting into his car, Michael suddenly sees the man who he bumped into at the amusement park. Michael sees the mystery man several more times throughout the episode and it becomes more clear the man is only a hallucination. Michael passes out and remembers events shortly before and after the crash; Hannah and Rex are singing the Queen song, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". Later, Michael meets with Emma's father Joaquin (Carlos Lacamara) at a coffee shop to discuss the new baby, the mystery man appears to let Michael know that he sees the real mystery man through the window and Michael chases after him. When a police artist (Chad Cleven) draws an image of the man, his real name is revealed to be Ed Hawkins (Kevin Weisman), another detective who took over Michael's spot at the police department after the crash, now working with Bird (Steve Harris), Michael's former partner in the \\"red reality\\" and his current one in the \\"green reality\\". Michael meets with Bird and Hawkins and the latter says that he was one of the first on the scene of the crash and that he is sorry about Rex's death. Michael starts to believe that his son is really dead; he remembers the crash, yet again, with additional information. Michael realizes that Hawkins was trying to kill him in the crash. As soon as he figures out the situation, Michael wakes up with Rex and Emma; he is relieved to see Rex. After the carnival, Michael phones Dr. Evans to tell her what he now knows about the crash.  Production  alt=A lady with long brown hair and a red shirt in front of a E! microphone, and she is talking. The episode was written by Leonard Chang and series creator Kyle Killen. It was Killen's sixth credit and Chang's second writing acknowledgment for the show. Note: Information is listed on individual episodes included on the list. The entry was directed by Laura Innes, who guest stars in the recurring role of Captain Tricia Harper in the series. It was Innes' first and only directing credit for Awake. Killen noted that, during the filming of the episode, he became \\"hungry\\" and wanted to \\"bend the rules\\" with the installment. He stated that the installment was a model episode that he wanted to \\"pursue with the show going forward\\". Killen also thought the last \\"three or four episodes\\" of Awake, including this episode, represent what the show's writers were able to accomplish throughout Awake original run. \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\" marked the first appearance of Hawkins, a detective who was described as a titular \\"little guy\\", from the series' second episode, \\"The Little Guy\\". Weisman obtained a recurring role in January 2012 and later garnered the role of the character. He was later revealed as the man who caused the Britten family's collision. This entry's production code was \\"1ATR10\\". It was filmed in Los Angeles, California. Isaacs found \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\" the \\"most difficult [episode] to shoot\\" as one of the character's realities was fabricated and had to disappear by the end. To prepare himself for the episode, he imagined that he had suddenly lost his own child or that something awful happened to his family. While Isaacs had \\"played cheesy disco music\\" through filming the majority of the episodes, he played nothing during the filming of \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\". During a scene where Michael sits on the floor and starts crying, Isaacs had \\"no idea what came out of [his mouth]\\". That scene was shot three or four times with a different performance by Isaacs each time; the actor did not know which take Innes would use.  Themes  \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\" continued and introduced key thematic elements to the series that were originally introduced in \\"The Little Guy\\". Key themes in this installment included when Michael was unable to see Rex and realized that Hawkins was trying to kill him in the car crash. It was described as a \\"show about grief\\" when it first started airing and that the \\"cause of the car crash didn't really matter\\" at that time. Now, however, The A.V. Club noted that Awake is \\"dabbling in crooked cops and God only knows what else\\". He observed that Michael could be having another defense to keep the fantasy world alive because of his thoughts with Hawkins. The A.V. Club also thought that Hawkins was the reasoning for the second episode's name. Writing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall observed that the episode came from Michael's perspective. According to Sepinwall, \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\" showed Hannah and Rex together for the first time in the flashback shortly before the crash. He opined that the only people who currently watch the series are \\"the ones who can quickly identify the red filter from the green filter and figure things out accordingly\\". Maggie Furlong from The Huffington Post thought that \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\" \\"surfaces some serious issues for Britten\\" that has only been \\"cryptically referenced\\" previously.  Broadcast and reception  \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\" originally aired on NBC on May 10, 2012, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on Sky Atlantic on July 13, 2012. The episode's initial broadcast in the United States was viewed by approximately 2.51 million viewers. \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\" earned a Nielsen rating of 0.9, with a 2 share, meaning that roughly 0.9 percent of all television-equipped households and 2 percent of households watching television were tuned in to the episode. A sneak peek was released online shortly before the episode's original broadcast. In the United Kingdom, the episode obtained 275,000 viewers, making it the third most-viewed program for the channel behind Alan Partridges: Mid Morning Matters and The Newsroom. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e 15 Jul 2012\\", listed under Sky Atlantic Shortly after this episode was broadcast, NBC announced their decision to cancel Awake, due to declining ratings. Despite the series' cancellation, NBC still decided to air the remaining two episodes. Before its original airing, \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\" was highly anticipated by commentators. In a review for \\"Slack Water\\", The A.V. Club claimed that \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\" would be \\"very cool\\" because Michael will \\"face a crisis when he stops waking up in [the green reality]\\". In a review for the same episode, Sepinwall called \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\" and the following episode \\"quite good\\". alt=A man with short black hair and a black shirt, and he is smiling. This episode generally received positive reviews from critics. Commentators from IGN, Paste and TV Fanatic were pleased with Isaacs' performance; they felt that his performance deserved an Emmy Award. IGN Matt Fowler described Isaacs' performance as \\"suspense\\"-worthy, while Paste writer Ross Bonaime thought that his acting deserved an Emmy nomination \\"at the very least\\". Although he did not note that his performance was Emmy-worthy, in his \\"A-\\" review, Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club claimed that Isaacs' is usually the \\"bad guy\\", but he seems like a \\"dad\\". Fowler gave the episode itself a \\"9.5 out of 10\\", classifying it as \\"amazing\\"; the entry's story was called \\"powerful\\". However, Bonaime gave the entry a \\"8.9\\" rating. Fowler and Nick McHatton, a TV Fanatic critic, stated that this was the best episode of the program since \\"Pilot\\"; Handlen said that the episode, for the most part, was \\"a great hour of television, and a fine uptick from the last couple weeks of Awake\\", while Bonaime called it \\"one of Awake most compelling episodes to date\\". McHatton called the emotional problems of the episode \\"heart wrenching\\" to watch\\", as they had him in tears; he gave a \\"4.9 out of 5\\" rating for the episode. Handlen complimented the \\"powerful scene, as [Michael] tries to convince her father that he should do anything possible to avoid losing touch with his daughter\\", and also noted that the episode \\"raises the stakes for [Michael], changing what he's come to accept as his routine for the first time since the start of the series: while bungee jumping at a fair with Rex and Emma in [the green reality], [Michael] has a fainting spell, and comes to in [the red reality]\\". Handlen claimed the episode \\"doesn't seem to fit everything else\\". Sepinwall complained that viewers went into \\"the episode already knowing that the Britten family's car crash was anything but\\". Sepinwall noted that \\"as it played not only with the structure of the show, but the emotions of our hero by showing us what happens if he stops going to sleep in one reality and waking up in the other\\". According to Sepinwall, \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\" was \\"effective\\" as it \\"forced [Michael] to finally confront a truth about his situation\\", and that he finally needs to grieve, by recognizing that one of his two loved ones is dead. Sepinwall praised how the episode \\"kept mirroring moments in the pilot\\", while Screen Rant writer Kevin Yeoman called the installment itself \\"powerful\\" and \\"compelling\\". Yeoman compared Awake to Mission: Impossible, writing that \\"with just two episodes left\\", Awake has to go into Mission: Impossible mode to \\"provide answers\\".

A Jewish presence in Wieluń was recorded from the early part of the 16th century (1537). Before World War II (1939–1945), Wielun had a large Jewish community (almost half of the local population), which was completely destroyed by the Nazis between 1940 and 1944. The main source regarding the history of Wieluń's Jewish community is the \\"Memorial Book\\" of Wielun (see below). Memorial Book of Wielun The book was published in Tel Aviv in 1971 by the Wielun Association in Tel Aviv, Israel, which still exists, together with the Memorial Book Committee in the United States. Apart from a lengthy introduction in English, which includes a brief history of the town's Jewish community, the book is in Yiddish and in Hebrew.Jewish Wielun, a Polish shtetl: Jolly, Philip (2010). Jewish Wielun, a Polish shtetl (527 pages). Lulu.com. In the English translation from Yiddish of the foreword, in the opening sentence, Moyshe Mendlevitsh spells out clearly what the Memorial Book: \\"The Wielun Memorial Book constitutes the only remembrance of our former home, which was so brutally and ruthlessly eradicated. The town of Wielun still stands, but its Jewish inhabitants can no longer be found, as they all met with a tragic end. No single breath of Jewish life remains.\\" M Mendlevitsh continues: \\"Our Memorial Book attempts to reconstruct fleeting moments, occurrences, experiences, and recreate the figures and types of the past, so that nothing may ever be forgotten; to depict the everyday life of our ruined home-town: the days of sorrow, the days of joy and the hope for a better tomorrow.\\" M Mendlevitsh stresses the fact that Wielun was known to Jews as Wilojn or Wilohn — the latter being the preferred spelling in all \\"official Jewish community documents and records\\". Despite entrenched hostility on the part of the Poles, which M Mendlevitsh mentions, the Jewish community thrived and its members \\"always took pride in their place of birth\\". Indeed, \\"Wielun is a Crown\\" was a popular Jewish saying. The town of Wielun was clean and prosperous by pre-war Polish standards, and Wielun's Jewish community was known to be well educated. The synagogue (built between 1830 and 1840) was the focal point of Jewish life in Wielun. Overview of the history of Wielun In \\"Details about the history of Wielun\\",Memorial Book (1971). No ISBN, p. 51, translated from Yiddish an overview of Wielun's history is given: \\"Wielun had been founded by Wladisław Adawicz at the end of the 12th century [AD]. The town has always been disputed territory among the ruling powers and has been burnt down several times. It was rebuilt by King Casimir the Great, who surrounded the town with a protective wall and co-opted it into the realm of the Polish Crown. During the times when the Jagellonians were ruling, the town flourished greatly. However, around the year 1858 [as had previously happened] during the Swedish invasion, it was burnt down again. Finally, during the time of the division of Poland [a reference, here, to the partitions], the town came under Russian occupation.\\" The author continues: \\"After the First World War, Wielun became a provincial town within a free, independent Poland and belonged to the province of Łódź*; [Wielun was then] about 14 kilometres from the Polish-German border. Wielun had 16,000 inhabitants, 40% of whom were Jews.\\" Key dates in the history of Wielun's Jewish community Wielun was an important town in medieval Poland and the Jewish community had been established in (or near) the town for a long time. 1265: A royal charter is issued, later expanded by Casimir the Great, the Polish king, which confirms Jewish liberties within the Polish Kingdom. Jews are granted a measure of communal autonomy, and Jewish communities grow across the country from the 13th century. At the time, there is a considerable influx of immigrants — Jewish or not — from the Netherlands and Northern Germany into Poland. 1520: A royal edict issued in Warsaw prohibits Jews from residing in the town of Wielun. 1537: First recorded mention of Jews in relation to Wielun. Jews could have lived in (or near) the town before without there being any mention of their presence, however. 1566 (12 June): The citizens of Wielun, which is a \\"royal town\\" under direct Polish government control, obtain that a fiat (or royal decree) be issued that prohibits the Jews from living within the town's boundaries. The prohibition is signed by Polish King Zygmunt August and is called (in Latin) De non-tolerandis Judaeis (Of the non-toleration of the Jews). The ban extends to Jews owning dwellings inside Wielun: they cannot possess properties and/or reside in the town. The legislation, however, allows Jews to come into Wielun on business, for instance, provided they do not stay in town.

A synagogue council is created. 1841: There are over 500 Jewish families in Wielun; a synagogue, made of masonry, has been successfully completed. 1850s: Previously Jews buried their dead in the cemetery of Działoszyn.

But the \\"new world\\" that Cherkaoui is exploring is current theories about the brain, and the text that the 17 dancers speak during the first moments of the 75-minute work comes from My Stroke of Insight, neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor's uncanny recollection of her stroke. The choreography is based on the ramifications of a single resonant idea: the duality between rationality (the left brain) and instinctive, sensual responses (the right brain); between control and the lack of it; between balance and instability, solitude and society. \\"Thus were the dancers speaking Taylor's words (“My spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria”), while they physically embodied brain waves and misfiring synapses, with a nod, perhaps, to the double helix: rubbery splayed limbs; über-arched backs; ever-rippling torsos.\\" “‘Orbo Novo’ is a humorous and insightful take on (Taylor’s) story,” said dancer Jubal Battisti. “It has a lot to do with the hemispheres of the brain switching between left and right and what that reveals.” References External links * , the author's website * Jill Bolte Taylor: My stroke of insight, Taylor's TED Talk Category:2008 non-fiction books Category:Psychology-related autobiographies Category:Stroke ","title":"My Stroke of Insight"},{"id":"35811937","title":"Wind power in North Dakota"},{"id":"35811957","text":"Clock tower, erected 1892 by Lorenzo Maynard, son of the founder. The Assabet Woolen Mill was originally a textile factory complex founded by Amory Maynard in 1847 near the Assabet River in the northern part of what was then Sudbury, Massachusetts.

Mullin, University of Massachusetts - Amherst, Landscape Architecture & Regional Planning Faculty Publication Series http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&context;=larp_faculty_pubs several grist mills and saw mills were constructed along the Assabet River up- and down-river from the site of the current mill building complex. In 1847 Amory Maynard and William Knight constructed the first buildings of Assabet Woolen Mill on the current site. The mill, located between its mill pond and the Assabet River, produced carpets and later wool cloth used in military uniforms during the American Civil War. The mill complex is also home to the oldest, still-working, hand-wound clock in the country (see image). The clock tower was constructed in 1892 by Lorenzo Maynard (Amory's oldest son) as a gift to the town. The weights that power the E. Howard & Co. tower clock and bell-ringing mechanisms are wound up once a week. The four clock faces have always been illuminated by electric lights. After bankruptcy in 1898, it was purchased by American Woolen Company which modernized and expanded the facility. Textile production ended in 1950, and the complex stood empty. In 1953, several Worcester businessmen formed Maynard Industries, Inc., which purchased the property and rented space to business and industrial tenants. In 1957 the newly created Digital Equipment Corporation (Digital) rented about 9,000 square feet of space in the mill complex. Digital expanded its space over time, until in 1974 it purchased the entire 1.1 million square foot complex. Maynard became known as the \\"Mini Computer Capital of the World.\\" Digital remained headquartered in Maynard until 1998, but it had shuttered operations in the mill buildings in 1993.Earls, Alan R.

She had been reported missing since January 27, 1973 from her home in Chesaning, Michigan. Believed to have been abducted from a shopping center in nearby Owosso, she was found to have been raped, and shot three times. After a long investigation, new technology in DNA analysis enabled Shiawassee County, Michigan police to charge Jerald Leroy Wingeart in 2001, who was identified by DNA collected at the murder scene. In November 2001 he was tried and convicted in the case, and sentenced to life in prison. The case was closed more than 28 years after Magyar's body was found. Background Magyar was born Dawn Lee Swan on March 28, 1952 in Corunna, Michigan, to parents Eleanor and Ralph Swan. She had brothers Max and Larry. The siblings grew up there and attended local schools; Swan graduated from the high school in 1970. Dawn was married to Don Magyar. At the time of her murder, she was 20 years old, and they had just celebrated the first birthday of their son. They lived in Chesaning, Michigan. Murder Magyar was believed to have been abducted on January 27, 1973 after grocery shopping in Owosso, Michigan in Shiawassee County. She was last seen by a friend who briefly talked with her in the supermarket checkout line and saw her leave the store with her purchases. After Magyar failed to return home that day, her husband reported her missing. The following day, police found the borrowed truck which she had been driving in the shopping center parking lot; her purchases were inside and her keys scattered at the truck, suggesting a forceful abduction. Despite a massive search of the area involving 4,000 local volunteers, Magyar was not found. On March 4, her body was discovered by two young brothers, Wayne and Bill Somers, who were tapping maple trees on their family farm in Saginaw County, Michigan. The medical examiner found that Magyar had been raped and shot three times in the head and back with a .22 caliber gun. An autopsy indicated that she had likely been killed within 90 minutes of being abducted. The bullets came from two Remington and one Winchester brand ammo. In June 1974, a .22 caliber revolver, believed to be the murder weapon, was recovered from the Shiawassee River in Owosso. The revolver was rusted and unable to fire, but still loaded. It contained three spent rounds that matched the brand of bullets that killed Magyar. The gun was traced to a pawn shop in Yuma, Arizona, where a man named Robert Shaw had purchased it in 1965. Investigators learned that he was Magyar's previous husband, but they were unable to locate him. In 1976 Magyar's wallet and identification were found on the bank of the Shiawassee River, in the same area where the .22 gun had been found. Reopening 2005 mugshot of Jerald Wingeart In 1995, the state police decided to reactivate the case. A detective sergeant reviewing cold cases realized that advances in DNA analysis (which had not been available as a forensic tool when the earlier investigation was conducted) might yield evidence to identify Magyar's killer, as the county police had collected sperm specimens from Magyar's body at the time of the crime. The Michigan State Police DNA Laboratory in East Lansing arranged for forensic DNA testing on this material to develop profiles of Magyar and her potential rapist and killer.Hornus, reprint from March 7, 2001, Argus-Press They also arranged for testing by an independent laboratory. They renewed their search for the known men in Magyar's life. In 1998, police located the gun's owner, Robert Shaw. He told authorities that he had owned the gun which they found, but that it had been lost many years before. He was cleared in the case by DNA testing. A few years later, Shaw told police that he remembered that, soon after they divorced, his ex-wife had dated a man named Jerald Leroy Wingeart. He said that Wingeart may have taken his gun at the time. Police learned that Wingeart at age 20, then a married University of Michigan (U-M) engineering student with a scholarship, had been convicted in 1961 for the rape of a blind female U-M student and armed robbery of her escort in Ann Arbor Township, Washtenaw County, Michigan. He served an eight-year prison sentence and was released in 1969. He later worked as a long-haul trucker and lived in more than one state. When police learned about him in relation to the Magyar case, Wingeart was 60 years old and living quietly in Center Line, Michigan with his fourth wife. He had a grown daughter from a previous marriage. He worked at Chrysler's Sterling Heights Stamping Plant in the accounting office. Known for his computer skills, he was considered a respected member of his community. Arrest and conviction As police investigated, they obtained Wingeart's DNA from saliva on cigarette butts which he had used and discarded in his trash. They found that his DNA matched the samples taken from the Magyar crime scene. They also determined that Wingeart had been in the Owosso area visiting a friend around the time of Magyar's murder. Unable to establish any link between Wingeart and Magyar, investigators believed that Wingeart had seen the young woman in the store or shopping center parking lot and randomly chose her as his victim. On March 7, 2001, Wingeart, aged sixty, was arrested and charged with Magyar's murder. He could not be charged for kidnapping or rape because of the statute of limitations on those crimes, 10 and 6 years, respectively. He was tried in November of that year at the Livingston County Courthouse. He claimed in his defense that he had had consensual sex with Magyar. But experts testified that Wingeart's DNA was left on Magyar during the brief timeframe that she went missing and was killed. On November 27, 2001, Wingeart was found guilty of first-degree felony and premeditated murder. In 2002 he was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.\\"The Disappearance of Dawn Magyar.\\" The Investigators. TruTV. Atlanta, Georgia, 2002. Television. Magyar's mother Eleanor and brother Larry Swan and his wife were alive to see justice served for Dawn. The father Ralph Swan had died in 1988. Status of appeals Wingeart's appeal of his conviction was rejected in 2003 by the Michigan Appeals Court, which affirmed the verdict. In May 2004 the Michigan Supreme Court denied his appeal of that ruling. Potential for new charges against Wingeart At the time of his conviction, Wingeart was under investigation for deaths of young women and other crimes committed in Washtenaw and Ionia counties in the previous ten years. The Argus-Press reported in May 2004 that the Michigan Attorney General's office announced that it was reviewing the cold case of the April 7, 1979 rape and murder of 16-year-old Laura Mae McVeigh near Hubbardston, Michigan, in Ionia County, with the potential for bringing charges against Wingeart. Because he had never reached trial in the murder of McVeigh, double jeopardy prohibitions would not apply. The prosecutors were working with Michigan State Police and investigators from Ionia County. In 1981 Wingeart had been arrested on charges related to McVeigh's death. He was living in Niles, Michigan, where he grew up, and had moved at least twice in the previous two years. The case was dismissed before trial in 1982 by the Wexford County, Michigan judge, who ruled that the police had violated Wingeart's rights in the course of a search for evidence. At the time of McVeigh's murder, Wingeart was 38 and living in Eaton Rapids; he worked for the state government. He was known to have left the area after McVeigh disappeared and before her body was found, a month after her death; he moved to New York. Within two years, he had returned to Michigan. In 2004 police said they expected to make use of advances in DNA analysis and other forensic technology in their investigation.

The China-Japan-South Korea Free Trade Agreement was proposed in 2002. Negotiations on the agreement were set in motion in 2012. The three nations make up to 19.6% of the world's economy. The first official talks on the matter were held in Seoul from 26–28 March 2013. Further talks were held in China and Japan throughout 2013, and more were scheduled for early 2014. Trade among the three economies totalled US$690 billion in 2011; however, progress on negotiations may be hampered by ongoing territorial disputes among the participants. Territorial disputes between Beijing and Tokyo led in 2012 to riots in China that targeted Japanese-owned businesses. Two-way trade between South Korea and China was totaled at $230 billion in 2013. A trilateral investment has been signed by all 3 nations. An agreement would push forward the integration of Asia's economies. The whole of Asia, along with the rest of the world economy, would benefit from their intimate and progressive trade relationship. A fourth round of talks were held in Seoul, South Korea from 4–7 March 2014. Intersessional Meeting of the Negotiations on Free Trade Agreement among Japan, China and the Republic of Korea was held in Tokyo, on June 17–18, 2014 before the fifth round of talks was scheduled for later that summer.

It is known from a single species, Halazhaisuchus qiaoensis, which was named in 1982 from the lower Ermaying Formation in Shaanxi. It was assigned to the family Euparkeriidae as a close relative of the genus Euparkeria from South Africa. Halazhaisuchus is known from a single holotype specimen called V6027, which was discovered in 1977 and includes a portion of the vertebral column, some ribs, two scapulae and two humeri, the right radius and ulna, and a left coracoid. Two rows of plate-like bones called osteoderms run along the length of the vertebrae. When it was first described in 1982, Halazhaisuchus was considered a close relative of Euparkeria because it has primitive features like small intercentra bones between the vertebrae and a large coracoid, not seen in later archosaurs. However, these features are common to many early archosauriforms and are not unique to Euparkeriidae. The fauna of the lower Ermaying Formation closely resemble those of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone in South Africa. Halazhaisuchus is similar to Euparkeria, while the Chinese Parakannemeyeria and Guchengosuchus resemble the South African Kannemeyeria and Erythrosuchus, respectively.

Ganzeer's artwork has touched on the themes of civic responsibility and social justice and has been critical of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or SCAF, which has ruled Egypt since the February 2011 resignation of former president Hosni Mubarak. Ganzeer means \\"chain\\" in Arabic. He is a regular contributor to the online magazine Rolling Bulb. Described by Bidoun Magazine as a \\"Contingency Artist,\\" Ganzeer is quite accustomed to adopting completely new styles, techniques, and mediums to adapt to the topic he is tackling at any given time. The Huffington Post has placed him on a list of \\"25 Street Artists from Around the World Who Are Shaking Up Public Art,\\" while Al-Monitor.com has placed him on a list of \\"50 People Shaping the Culture of the Middle East.\\" He is one of the protagonists in a critically acclaimed documentary titled Art War by German director Marco Wilms. Ganzeer was also cited by German Arte as one of Egypt's highest-selling living artists today. Politics and Artistic Genre Political street art was not common in Egypt prior to the 2011 revolution, however it has proliferated in public spaces in the post-revolution era. Artwork targeting SCAF in particular has surged in popularity since the revolution because, according to The Christian Science Monitor, such \\"anti-military graffiti is a reflection of Egyptian activists' frustration with the military rulers, who they say replaced one autocracy with another.\\" Regarding the genre of artistic production in which he participates, Ganzeer has said that \\"I'm not exactly a graphic designer, nor am I a product designer. I am not particularly a street- artist or comic book artist, nor am I an installation artist, writer, speaker, or video-maker. But I've had the chance to assume one of those roles at different periods of time and in different locations around the world.\\" Indeed, in addition to his better-known street art, Ganzeer has produced artistic content for \\"magazines, events, projects and musicians.\\" Ganzeer rejects the label of \\"street artist,\\" having said that \\"Being called a graffiti artist is something that I'm entirely against. It's not really fair to other real street-artists because I'm not necessarily a street artist, and I don't think in street art terms.\\" Artwork Ganzeer's street art specifically has been noted for its implicit and explicit criticism of SCAF. For example, immediately after the February revolution, Fahmy created a series of murals depicting \\"martyrs\\" who were killed during the revolution, calling these \\"Martyr Murals\\". Although street art of various forms was being produced during the revolution, these murals fulfilled a public desire to see the martyrs commemorated publicly and instantly. The Egyptian government's efforts to remove these murals from public buildings led to the May 2011 \\"Mad Graffiti Weekend\\" protest action. Ganzeer was detained on 26 May 2011https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/ganzeer.htm, after he was reported for distributing stickers depicting the \\"Mask of Freedom\\" image that depicts \\"a mannequin's torso with head sheathed in a gimp mask decorated with two miniature wins\\". The accompanying caption reads \\"Salute from the Supreme Council to the youth of the loving nation.\\" Ganzeer has participated in many art exhibits around the globe. In 2011, he participated in a Toronto exhibition titled Cairo 20x20. The exhibition was held at The Mascot Café and Art Gallery and the theme was a look into the capital city of Egypt as portrayed by 20 contemporary Egyptian artists and designers. Each person was given a 20x20 cm canvas and asked to portray what their city meant to them, using any medium. The 20 also included Ibraheem Youssef, Ahmed Hafez, Mahmoud Hamdy, Ahmed Foula and Ibrahim Eslam. Comics Ganzeer has also created a few comics, including his debut graphic novel The Solar Grid (2019).https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/ganzeer.htm Exhibitions This Should be Made Public – Goethe Institut, Cairo, Egypt – 2007 Everyday Heroes – Townhouse Onsite, Cairo, Egypt – 2007 The One Minutes – Rawabet Theatre, Cairo, Egypt – 2008 Tashkeel Gallery, Dubai, Cairo, Egypt – 2008 Urban Artists – Tashkeel Gallery, Dubai, UAE – 2008 Art Threesome – Foundation B.A.D, Rotterdam, The Netherland – 2008 Cairoscape – Uqbar, Berlin, Germany – 2008 Radius of Art – Kiel, Germany – 2008Ganzeer, City of Silent Noise.

The Tree of Life is a complicated colorful sculpture which was developed from the creation of candlesticks. The family’s prominence began with Modesta Fernández Mata, the mother, grandmother and great-grandmother of the Soteno potters today, who began experimenting making more decorative items along with utilitarian ones. The generations after her have learned the craft and improved on it starting as children working with parents and grandparents. The two most notable members of the family are Tiburcio and Oscar, second and third generation respectively, who have won various awards and have their works in collections worldwide. History View of the Tiburcio Soteno workshop in Metepec The Sotenos are one of the families of ceramic artisans that have made Metepec an important production center in Mexico. Metepec is known for sun decorations for walls, guitar-strumming mermaids, skeletal figures, animals of Noah's Ark along with other items, which attract buyers from Mexico City and Toluca. The municipality is a suburb of industrial Toluca but the historic center still maintains its rural feel with tile roofs and stone paved streets. The making of pottery in the Valley of Toluca goes back at least 1000 years due to rich clay deposits. In the colonial period, Metepec become a ceramics center, blending European and indigenous traditions, mostly specializing in black and green tableware, toys, religious figure and candlestick holders. Diego Rivera is credited with introducing new color schemes to a pottery making family in the 1940s with other workshops following suit. Around the same time, Metepec potters became to transform candleholders into tree sculptures which have become the town’s best known exports. The original trees were relatively plain with limited motifs, mostly the Garden of Eden. Over time, they became more elaborate, more colorful and larger. The Soteno pottery family descends from Darío Soteno León and Modesta Fernández Mata. Both were potters making utilitarian items, but in the 1930s Modesta began to experiment with more decorative items, starting with whistles in animal shapes as one of Metepec’s pioneer potters. She has a prestigious contest named after her called the Modesta Fernandez National Pottery and Ceramic Competition, which attracts artisan from all over Mexico. The couple produced ten children Mónico, Carmen, Estela, Alfonso, Víctor, Tiburcio, Pedro, Teresa, Manuel and Agustina, all of which have worked in pottery. Like many other workshops in the town, the Sotenos work in multigenerational enterprises with four generations in the vocation. Each artisan in the family has its own style and preferences in shaping items and the paints used. The Soteno artists have garnered acclaim both at home and abroad, as their sculptures are part of museum collections in Mexico, the United States, Canada, Europe and South Africa . Their works can be found in private collections, museums, galleries and other institutions in the U.S., France, Sweden, Japan, Switzerland, Germany, England, China and Brazil. The family hopes that the tradition with continue with the succeeding generations. Tree of Life sculptures There are several Soteno workshops which are intergenerational. These workshops produce a number of products including figures for Nativity scenes and other Christmas items, especially the workshop of Juan Manuel Soteno, with pieces for the sets can range from fifty to seven thousand pesos with pieces up to 1.2 meters tall. Another product are skeletons and skulls associated with Day of the Dead . However, the Sotenos are best known for Tree of Life sculptures. The time it takes to complete a Tree depends on size and complexity, anywhere from a day to two months of 15-hour workdays. Sizes can range from twenty centimeters to over a meter in height. The sculptures are made from the reddish and yellow clays found in a nearby community called Ocotitlán. The mined clay is left out to dry and the clumps broken up, sometimes but putting them out into the street for cars to roll over. As needed, the powdered clay is mixed with water and a flower called “tule” to soften and whiten the clay. The small details may be made with molds, but a number of artisans in the family, including Oscar, prefer to do it all by hand. Details and branches may be attached or reinforced by wire, but both Oscar and Tiburcio avoid the use of wire as it can break over time. The piece is carefully dried and fired. The largest trees may be fired in separate parts and in stages. Then they painted with anilines, natural pigments, acrylics and sometimes enamel. Tiburcio Soteno Carlos Soteno with one of his creations at the family workshop Today, the patriarch of the Soteno family is Tiburcio Soteno Fernández. He was taught to work clay by his parents eventually coming to specialize in Trees of Life. As an adult with his own workshop, his wife Amelia helped when his own children, Saul, Carlos and Israel were young. Now they all work with their father at the workshop on Calle Ezequiel Capistran, along with their wives and Tiburcio’s grandchildren. This workshop does not have a gallery but instead works by special order. Tibercio earns on average only 2,000 pesos a week making pieces that can value at over 8,000. He has sold pieces for as high as $5,000 USD. Pieces from his workshop rated from seven cm to over five meters in height. Today Tiburcio tries to fill in as many empty spaces as possible to avoid the use of wire, which he says rusts over time, making the piece fall apart. Tiburcio calls his work “arbóles retablo” or altarpiece trees. Tiburcio models most of the pieces by hand, only occasionally using molds. He uses aniline dyes for color. Tiburcio says that he tries to create stories with his trees. Themes of these trees have ranged from the religious to the erotic, with famous characters such as the Virgin of Guadalupe and Frida Kahlo as well as stories of everyday people who placed special orders. When he receives a special order, he researches the topic before beginning to sculpt. One such order was based on Laura Esquivel’s novel Like Water for Chocolate . Other themes have included Dante's Inferno, the discovery of the Americas, the life of poet Sor Juana, the Mexican War of Independence and an epic tree with the title of “The Conquest of Mexico.” He has pieces in the permanent collections of the British Museum, the Museum of Modern Art in Scotland, the Lancaster City Museum and in various museums in France. One particular permanent exhibition of his work is at the Museum of Mankind in London which relates to Day of the Dead as well as a piece dedicated to the 500th anniversary of Columbus’s discovery of America. His works are in many private collections including those of French cinematographer François Reichenbach. He has exhibited at the San Ildefonso College in Mexico City. Other works can be found in Canada, Italy and Germany. For 2010, the family made a number of pieces related to the Bicentennial of Mexico’s Independence features figures such as Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, José María Morelos y Pavón, Emiliano Zapata and Pancho Villa . He created the Tree of Life that appears in the church of San Francisco in Ecuador, whose story extends from the origin of sin in the Garden of Eden to the 21st century. Tiburcio also created the three meter tall double sided Tree sculpture that is on the place next to the 16th century Franciscan monastery in his hometown of Metepec. Tiburcio, along with Carlos Soteno, has traveled abroad for exhibitions and lectures, including those at the Museum of Man and the ethnography department of the Museum of London . He has won a number of awards and recognitions including the La Rosa de Oro, the Maestro de Maestros (1995), Concurso Nacional de Artesanías in Metepec, Premio Fomento Cultural Banamex (1996) and the Presea Estado de México (2000) . Oscar Soteno Tree of Life sculpture by Oscar Soteno at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City Oscar Soteno is Tiburcio’s nephew, the son of Alfonso Soteno. Like the generation before him, he learned to work clay as a child, specializing in Trees of Life as an adult in 1988. Today he runs his own shop with his wife Maria and three other family members. Most of the works from this shop measure one meter high by 85 cm wide although much larger and smaller ones are also produced. Oscar Soteno Elías family workshop is just outside Metepec on the highway that leads to Ixtapan de la Sal. The workshop is dominated by a large courtyard which is in turn dominated by two large brick and adobe kilns where the pieces are fired. Just off the courtyard is the small gallery where pieces are exhibited and sold. Oscar Soteno has also been experimenting with selling his pieces online, especially Day of the Dead themed work for Halloween in the United States, with sales rising. Oscar has his own niche. He makes the traditional Trees of Life with the traditional theme of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden, but he also makes trees with other themes such as the life of Christ, the love story of a couple, and trees covered with monarch butterflies. Occasionally he creates trees with multiple faces, usually three, which cover diverse themes. For example, a tree can have a scene depicting the birth of Christ, the Last Supper and the Crucifixion. Another example is the courtship, marriage and death of a couple. To decorate the trees, fine brushes and paints made himself from natural pigments are generally used. The final piece receives a coat of glue-based varnish. Attention is paid to the details. Oscar created a tree to honor his grandmother, Modesta, who died in 1987. This prizewinning sculpture features a figure of Modesta, sitting in a chair painting a tiny mermaid figure. The rest of the tree has small scale representations of typical Mexican handcrafts including a miniature Tree of Life. It is to represent what she began making, which at first were whistles and piggy banks. He was also commissioned for sculptures by John Paul II . Oscar has exhibited extensively in national and international museums. His pieces stand out for the quality of the finish and their variety of rich colors. He has won a number of acknowledgements and awards at exhibitions, competitions and art fairs, including the Galardón Nacional in Jalisco in 1995 and the Premio Fomento Cultural Banamex in 1996. He was selected by the Fomento Cultural Banamex to participate in the organization’s program to promote Mexican handcrafts and folk art as one of Mexico’s 150 Great Masters of Mexican Folk Art. Other members of the family Mónico Soteno Fernández is the oldest brother of the family. He learned pottery from his maternal grandparents as well as his mother, starting at age seven. He is considered to be one of the founders of Metepec’s Tree of Life tradition. He has won various awards including the Premio Pantaleón Panduro from the state of Jalisco the XV Premio Nacional de Cerámica and first and second place in the Segundo Concurso Nacional de Objetos Navideños Tradicionales. He has exhibited his work in The Founder’s Gallery at the University of California, San Diego, the Conjunto Ollin Yoliztli, Galería Toltecayotl, \\" and at the Galería Flora in Torreón, Coahuila. Carlos Moisés Soteno is the son of Tiburcio and has traveled with his father for exhibitions and lectures. His works are part of the collections of museums in Europe and Canada. The Cuban government honored José Alfonso Soteno Fernández granting the Haydee Santamaría medal. It was awarded for a Tree of Life sculpture donated to Cuba in 1975 by then Mexican president Luis Echeverría Álvarez. This sculpture is seven meters tall and contains 663 figures including mermaids, suns and moons which has become one of the symbols of the Casa de las Américas in Havana.

After a series of moves (previously serving the eastern exurb of Social Circle), the station now transmits from the WUPA tower east of downtown, just north of Interstate 20. The station broadcasts a hip hop music format, with a heavy emphasis on local artists, and is less mainstream than other similar stations in the format such as WHTA and WVEE. W233BF is owned by Edgewater Broadcasting, though operated by Core Communications. Originally applied-for in 2003, the station went on the air in July 2007, and immediately requested permission to move to 105.3, becoming W287BI. Due to RF interference from full-power WBZY, it requested to go back to 94.5 in July 2010, regaining its old frequency (and therefore callsign) by December that year. In November however, it had already applied to move closer to Atlanta, where it was located north of Conyers, broadcasting a Christian radio format as The Spirit 94.5. In late March 2012, it applied to move to the WUPA tower in the Inman Park neighborhood east of downtown Atlanta.

The younger Bell conducted his earliest experiments in North America there, and later invented the telephone at the Homestead in July 1874. In a 1906 speech to the Brantford Board of Trade, Bell commented on the telephone's invention: \\"the telephone problem was solved, and it was solved at my father's home\\". The approximately 4-hectare (10 acre) site has been largely restored to its appearance when the Bells lived there in the 1870s, and Melville House now serves as a museum to the family and to the invention of the telephone. A large visitor reception centre has also been added adjacent to Melville House. The Henderson Home building was later added to the Homestead in 1969, being moved there from its original location in downtown Brantford. It was Canada's first telephone company business office, opened in 1877 as a predecessor of the Bell Telephone Company of Canada. After being moved to the Bell Homestead it was converted into an adjunct museum on the development of telephone technology. The Homestead is operated by the Bell Homestead Committee of the City of Brantford.http://www.bellhomestead.ca/aboutus/Pages/BellHomesteadCommittee.aspx The Homestead was named a National Historic Site on June 1, 1996, and was listed on the national Register of Historic Places on June 22, 2009. The replacement for a federal commemorative plaque was unveiled the following year by Queen Elizabeth II during the 150th anniversary year celebrations for the birth of Alexander Graham Bell. Melville House has been described as \\"...this shrine, where lingers the spirit of the great inventor\\".  History  The Bell Homestead period began with the arrival of the Bell family in the summer of 1870 from their native Scotland, where two of their sons had died of tuberculosis and their middle son, Alexander Graham Bell, was additionally stricken and being consumed by disease. The Bell Homestead complex in the present day consists of several buildings with their own origins. The principal building at the site is Alexander Melville Bell's farmhouse, Melville House, along with its related greenhouse conservatory, outbuildings and fruit orchard. The farmhouse and its farmland were acquired for preservation as a museum in 1909. The Henderson Home, which had served as Canada's first telephone business office in downtown Brantford, was later moved to the site in 1969 and renovated extensively in 1970, to convert it into a separate telephone museum under the principal sponsorship of the county's largest telephone carrier, Bell Canada. As well, a tea house, a visitor reception centre with a mini audio-video theatre and related facilities were also added to the homestead to accommodate visitors and tour groups. = Father and son = Professor Alexander Melville Bell, a Scottish- born British authority on speech and elocution, immigrated to Canada by steamship in July 1870 with his family and daughter-in-law, who had been widowed by the death of Bell's eldest son from tuberculosis in May of that year. The family's youngest son Edward had similarly died of tuberculosis three years earlier, and during their departure from the British Isles their middle son Alexander Graham now appeared to be faltering from the same disease. Upon landing at Quebec City on 1 August 1870, the Bells transferred to another steamer to Montreal,Gray 2006, p. 21. and then took the Grand Trunk Railway to Paris, Ontario, residing at the parsonage of the Reverend Thomas Philip Henderson. Henderson was a Baptist minister and close family friend who likely went to school with Melville in Scotland, and who had previously invited the Bell family to immigrate to Canada. After a brief stay of only a few days with the Hendersons, the Bell family purchased a homestead of 5 hectares (13 acres) at Tutelo Heights (in the present day called Tutela Heights, named for the First Nations band that had previously settled the area), on the outskirts of Brantford, Ontario, for CA$2,600 (approximately CA$ in current dollars), with $2,100 being paid immediately.Patten & Bell 1926, p. 8. They were likely assisted in their search by the advance efforts of Reverend Henderson, who was also employed as a school board inspector. At the time of the Bell family's departure from the UK, Alexander Graham's health was threateningly poor, with \\"a chest condition... giving cause for concern\\" and his tall, broad-framed body being reduced to 59 kg (130 lb), leaving his face gaunt.Gray 2006, p. 20.Patten & Bell 1926, p. 7. Grand River and would later write the draft specifications of the telephone patent. The city's largest newspaper, the Brantford Expositor, soon announced the Bell family's arrival, writing that it was \\"...pleased to welcome to our town and neighbourhood A. Melville Bell, Esq., Professor of Elocution, of University College, London [...who...] has purchased from Robert Morton a property containing 10.5 acres of land with a good orchard, beautifully situated on the Mt. Pleasant road some two miles from Brantford\\". At their new home Melville's surviving son Alexander Graham Bell created his laboratory inside the farm's converted carriage house, nearby to what he called his \\"dreaming place\\", a large hollow nestled in the elm trees at the back of the property, above the river where he could view its surface.Groundwater 2005, p. 34. Despite his frail condition upon arriving in Canada, Alexander Graham found the climate and environs to his liking, and he rapidly improved, regaining his health.Mackay 1997, p. 62. He later related at the unveiling of the Bell Telephone Memorial: Alexander Graham frequented his \\"dreaming place\\", lying on a roll of carpet with a pillow and his books. He would relax, think, and \\"...dream away the afternoon in luxurious idleness\\" while also contemplating the undulating ripples of the Grand River below him. The younger Bell continued his previous interest in the study of the human voice, and when he discovered the Six Nations Reserve across the river at Onondaga, he learned the Mohawk language and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols, a written scientific vocabulary invented by his father. For his work Alexander Graham earned the tribe's friendship and was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a Mohawk headdress and performed traditional dances. Thereafter Bell would break into a Mohawk war dance if he became intensely excited.Groundwater 2005, p. 35. After setting up his laboratory–workshop in the Homestead's carriage house, the younger Bell also continued his earlier electrical experiments based on misunderstood translations of Dr. Hermann von Helmholtz's work on electricity and sound as described in Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen als physiologische Grundlage für die Theorie der Musik (The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music).Wing 1980, p. 10. He also modified a melodeon (a type of pump organ) so that it could transmit its music electrically over a distance. When the family was settled in and he had regained his health, both Alexander Graham and his father, an authority on the acoustics of speech, made plans to establish teaching practices. As the senior Bell was soon occupied with a lecture position at Queen's College in Kingston, Ontario, he sent his son to Boston in his place when a contract was offered to teach in that city for the handsome sum of US$500 (approximately US$ in current dollars). Over the next several years the younger Bell would live and work in the Boston area during the school year, and then return to his parents' homestead during the summer months to rest with his family and conduct further telegraphic, and later, telephonic research work. During his summer vacation at the Homestead in 1874, Alexander Graham continued to contemplate electrical sound reproduction while viewing the undulating surface of the Grand River from his \\"dreaming place\\". He postulated that \\"it would be possible to transmit sounds of any sort\\" by the continuous variation of the intensity of the electric current. This method of sound energy to electrical signal transduction was fundamentally different from the on-or-off transmission methods used by other telephone experimenters. Alexander Graham held lengthy discussions with his father explaining what he thought he could achieve with a sound-driven transmitter producing an electrical signal which would instantaneously travel an electrical circuit to a receiver at another location where it would be converted back to sound. His record of a discussion with his father in their home's living room, wrote \\"If I could vary the intensity of the electric current in exact proportion to the variation of the air density in the production of words, I would be able to transmit speech by telegraph\\" (using the telephone's technical analog, the telegraph, as the former name had not yet been adapted). On 26 July 1874 in their living room the younger Bell realized the technical principles of telephony,Gray 2006, pp. 73–74. inventing the telecommunications device he is now closely identified with. Returning again to the Homestead the next summer in 1875 Bell wrote his first draft specifications of the telephone patent—commonly considered to be the most valuable patent in history—that September. He later built his first fully functional unit at Boston on March 10, 1876. Later that year, in August, Bell made the first successful voice transmission of any notable distance, between Brantford and Paris Ontario. On July 26, 1974, the Post Office Department released a commemorative postage stamp honouring the centennial of the invention of the telephone stating \\"At Brantford... Alexander Graham Bell, a young teacher of the deaf, spent a few weeks of leisurely contemplation and invented the telephone.\\" The stamp depicts three telephones of various time periods, including his famous Gallows model, considered the world's first telephone. In 1915 Alexander Graham referred to it saying \\"The instrument, just as you see it here, was invented in the summer of 1874, during a visit I paid to my father and mother in Brantford...\\" As well, one of the first successful voice transmission of any notable distance (6 km) was made on 4 August 1876, between the telegraph office in Brantford, Ontario and Melville House over makeshift wires.MacLeod, Elizabeth (1999). Alexander Graham Bell: An Inventive Life. Toronto, Ontario: Kids Can Press. p. 14 to 19. = Three great tests of the telephone = The master telephone patent, 174465, granted 7 March 1876 Only a few months after receiving U.S. Patent No. 174465 at the beginning of March 1876, Bell conducted three important tests of his new telephone invention and technology after he returned to his parents at Melville House for the summer. The third and most important test was the world's first true long-distance call, placed between Brantford and Paris, Ontario on 10 August 1876. For that long-distance call Alexander Graham Bell set up a telephone using telegraph lines at Robert White's Boot and Shoe Store at 90 Grand River Street North in Paris via its Dominion Telegraph Co. office on Colborne Street. The normal telegraph line between Paris and Brantford was not quite 13 km (8 miles) length, but the connection was extended a further 93 km (58 miles) to Toronto to allow the use of a battery in its telegraph office. When the line connections were completed Graham Bell heard \\"...explosive sounds, like the discharge of artillery.... mixed with a continuous crackling noise of an indescribable character\\". Bell began to troubleshoot his device and after changing his telephone receiver's electromagnet from low to high resistance, voices suddenly emerged from the receiver \\"clearly and strongly\\", on a telegraph line connection of some 106 km (66 miles) length. Speaking to his son in Paris from Brantford's Dominion Telegraph office, Professor Alexander Melville Bell sang songs, quoted Shakespeare and read poetry. In Paris, news of Bell's test quickly drew crowds of onlookers who witnessed Melville's voice emanating from the crude metal box. With only a telephone receiver, Alexander Graham Bell could not respond directly to his father, and instead replied back by telegraph on a separate line to Brantford. Nevertheless Alexander Graham much later declared that this was the first one-way long-distance call \\"of several miles\\", but noted it was \\"the first transmission at a distance, but it was not the first reciprocal (two-way) conversation over a line. That was held in Boston on 9 October 1876. Nonetheless, the third test in Southern Ontario was the world's first long- distance call, proving that the telephone was useful not only over short distances. On a test call one week earlier on 3 August 1876, Alexander Graham's uncle, Professor David Charles Bell, spoke to him from the Brantford telegraph office, reciting lines from Shakespeare's Hamlet (\\"To be or not to be....\\"). The young inventor, positioned at the A. Wallis Ellis store in the neighbouring community of Mount Pleasant,MacLeod 1999, p. 14. listened to his uncle's voice emanating from his receiver housed in a metal box. Initially David Bell's voice couldn't be heard distinctly as \\"...all kinds and sizes of wire were used in stringing from the house to Mount Pleasant road\\". However, Walter Griffin, the Dominion Telegraph manager, decided to attach the telegraph line to a battery to see if it would improve the transmission, which it did, and \\"the voices then came in distinctly.\\" That first Brantford call was followed the next day on 4 August during another call between Brantford's telegraph office and Melville House when a large dinner party, including members of the Cowherd family who would later manufacture phones for Bell in Canada's first telephone factory, provided \\"....speech, recitations, songs and instrumental music\\" that were transmitted to the Bell Homestead. To bring telephone signals to Melville House, Alexander Graham audaciously \\"bought up\\" and \\"cleaned up\\" the complete supply of stovepipe wire within Brantford. With the help of two of Melville's neighbours, E. McIntyre and Thomas Brooks, he tacked the stovepipe wire some 800 metres (a half mile) along the top of fence posts from his parents’ home to a junction point on the Mount Pleasant telegraph line, which joined that community to the Dominion Telegraph office in Brantford.Patten & Bell, 1926, p. 15–16, 19. Scientific American noted the test calls in their 9 September 1876 article, The Human Voice Transmitted by Telegraph. Historian Thomas Costain referred to them as \\"the three great tests of the telephone\\". One journalist wrote of them, \\"No one involved in these early calls could possibly have understood the future impact of these communication firsts\\". = Melville House = The carriage house used by Alexander Graham Bell in his early experiments (2012). Melville House was the name given to his home by the elder Bell, and which was used on the letterhead of his stationery, reading in full: \\"Melville House, Tutelo Hights\\". The large 10-room, two story wooden neoclassical Italianate villa style farmhouseGray 2006, p. 23. was originally built in 1858 for Robert Morton, a retired Montreal building contractor who moved to the area to be close to his two sons Andrew and Y.J., owners of the Morton Hardware Store in Brantford. The elder Morton had purchased several hundred acres of land along the Grand River one year earlier from Margaret and Elizabeth Stewart at a cost of £183 (equivalent to approximately C$25,800 in 2012).Historical U.K. Inflation & Price Conversion, Safalra.com website, retrieved 9 August 2012. The farmhouse was constructed amid towering elm trees, from hand-hewn lumber on a fieldstone foundation and finished with masonry stucco and lath work. Its architectural features included pine and wood pegged floors, walnut window trims, a main floor ceiling over three metres (10 feet) in height, a low-pitched gabled roof, a gingerbread trim-styled front veranda as well as a bathtub and shower equipped washroom fitted to an attic or ceiling level rainfall cistern —installed by the younger Bell at a time when few homes in the region had any fixed bathtubs at all. Its shower and oversized bathtub (likely chosen for the younger Alexander's large frame) drew hot and cold water from piping leading to both a ceiling level cistern and to a hot water heater in the basement. The home's layout featured a central hallway plan and its ten rooms included a large kitchen, large dining room, parlour, study plus four bedrooms on its upper floor.Gray 2006, pp. 22–23. A greenhouse conservatory with a workroom at its rear were also added by the Bells to the side of the house, off of its parlour. They were later removed in the 1920s, and then rebuilt in the early 1970s along with the house's verandah and chimneys. The property, which borders the Grand River, originally contained an approximate 4-hectare (10.5 acres) fruit orchard, large farmhouse, stable, pigsty, henhouse, icehouse and a carriage house.Mackay 1997, p. 61. During the Bells' 11-year residence at the Homestead, the working farm, with its plum, cherry, pear, apple and peach orchards, supplemented Melville's modest income from dramatic readings at elocutionary performances and university lectures on elocution and vocal physiology. Moreover, college lecture assignments were scarce for the male Bells as the nearest university was in Toronto, some 105 km (65 miles) away.Gray 2006, p. 31. The Bell family was not well-to-do, but upper-middle class, and depended on the sales of their farm products to make ends meet. After Melville sold the homestead to Matthew Whiting in 1881 to join his son in Washington, D.C., the handsome farmhouse and property changed ownership five more times until it was acquired in 1909 by the Bell Telephone Memorial Association, which at the time was collecting funds to build a major memorial to both Alexander Graham and to the invention of the telephone, the Bell Telephone Memorial. In 1910 Melville House became a museum dedicated to the Bell family, including both Melville and Alexander, and to Alexander Graham's invention of the telephone there in July 1874. The Homestead was deeded by the Association to the City of Brantford in 1917, with restoration of the home to its earlier condition taking several decades. In 1925 it was moved closer to Tutela Heights Road onto a new foundation further from the Grand River due to the continuing erosion of the tall river bank adjacent to the farmhouse. This was done only after the City of Brantford had attempted to stabilize the bluffs with pilings to prevent further erosion in the early 1920s—attempts which were unsuccessful. A portion of Melville House's parlour, restored to the Victorian era style maintained by the Bells, using many of their original furnishings and artifacts, including their melodeon, seen in front of the window at centre (2009). The Bell Homestead Museum first opened to the public in October 1910 with two rooms available for viewing, and over several decades repurchased or received donations of much of the Bell family's original home furnishings, including its cabinetry, furniture and piano-like melodeon, eventually comprising 90% of their Melville House furnishings. Further donations from Bell family descendants also included books, china, paintings, a silver tea service that was a wedding gift to Alexander Graham and his bride Mabel Bell, a gold candy dish that was a wedding present to the elder Bells, Melville's walnut shaving stand and Mabel's favourite wing chair. One important donated item is the original melodeon (serial number 16265 of the George A. Prince Company) given to the Homestead museum by the granddaughter of Jenny Cowherd (who later became Mrs. Joseph Durnan). Jenny's father was Thomas Cowherd, whose hardware store supplied stovepipe wire to Graham Bell, and her brother was James, who built almost 2,400 telephones for Melville's telephone company and for the Bell Telephone Company of Canada. Jenny also played the melodeon and sang for at least one of Alexander Graham's telephone demonstrations. Many of the items had originally been sold at auction in 1881 by Melville's family when he and his wife moved to join their son Alexander Graham in Washington, D.C., much later being donated back to the Melville House Museum. A third room, to the left of the front entrance on the ground floor, was not furnished and opened to the public until 1947. The Homestead and Melville House museum have developed special programs through the years, such as their Christmas holiday celebrations when the farmhouse is \\"...decorated in the style and traditions of Alexander Graham Bell's American wife Mabel, with stockings stuffed full of oranges and toy trinkets.\\" Costumed interpreters and slide presentations also provide the public with a more personal and comprehensive experience. They have additionally earned plaudits for their dedication to authenticity, with one reviewer writing: Overall, the journalist noted: Melville House and the Homestead, visited by over a million people from numerous countries around the world, has been described as \\"...this shrine, where lingers the spirit of the great inventor\\". At a farewell dinner at Brantford's Kerby House as Melville was preparing to depart for Washington, D.C., the elder Bell addressed the invited banquet guests, saying \\"[Our son] could not come to us, so we resolved to go to him. I now confidently feel that my sojourn in Brantford will outlive my existence because under yon roof of mine the telephone was born\\". = Henderson Home = A historical plaque to the side of the Henderson Home, commemorating Canada's first telephone business office of 1877. The two story white framed clapboard home of Reverend Thomas Philip Henderson (b. Scotland, 1816 – d. 1887), served as his combined residence and religious library as well as the business office of Canada's first telephone company. In 1969 the house was carefully raised onto a flatbed mover and relocated from Brantford's downtown area (at 30, formerly 46 Sheridan Street, approximately three city blocks from the Bell Telephone Memorial), to the Homestead site where it was renovated to serve as a telephone company museum. The house had been donated in October 1968 by its then-owner, William C. Burles (born in Bath, England, 1885, eighteen years after Alexander Graham taught there at its Somersetshire College),Bruce 1973, p. 51–54 and it is now known at the Homestead as the Henderson Home. The house, likely built in 1843, had been Burles' family home for some 44 years. At the time of its donation he was living there as a widower along with his daughter, his wife having died the previous December. The four bedroom structure had previously been the home and office of Reverend Thomas Henderson (1817-1887), the close friend, advisor and associate of Melville Bell and his son Alexander Graham. Henderson had persuaded Melville and his family to immigrate to Canada in 1870 to prevent the death of his last son Alexander Graham, who was being consumed by disease.Must, Chris. Here lie many of Perth's most famous residents, Perth EMC Lifestyle, Hall of Remembrance Military Museum. Retrieved from HallOfRememberance.com website 22 August 2014. Melville Bell appointed Henderson as his phone company's general agent \\"for the Dominion of Canada\\" after Melville received 75% of the phone's Canadian patent rights from his son in 1877. Henderson faithfully served Melville's company from 1877 until 1880, when he became an employee of the Bell Telephone Company of Canada (later Bell Canada) at their Montreal headquarters. Henderson served Bell in Montreal until his death in 1888. Henderson also supervised the telephone manufacturing being conducted at the Brantford telephone factory run be Bell's friend James Cowherd, son of the Brantford's hardware store owner Thomas C. Cowherd who had supplied the Alexander Graham with almost all of the stovepipe wire available, used for his Bell's first telephone line. Cowherd's Brantford factory's first shipment of nineteen telephones was made to Hugh Cossart Baker in Hamilton, Ontario on 23 December of that year, with total production of all orders eventually reaching 2,398 phones before James was stricken with tuberculosis and died. Henderson later moved to Montreal to join the Bell Telephone Company of Canada where he became their purchasing agent and storekeeper until his death in 1887. In September 1877 the Bells' installed a 5 km (3 mile) telephone line from their homestead to connect to Reverend Henderson's house in downtown Brantford where the city's telephone exchange was installed. A telephone line was also installed to the city's telegraph office. On 9 August 1970, Ontario Lieutenant Governor William Ross Macdonald, aided by the home's former owner William Burles, officially opened the Henderson House before an invited assembly of distinguished guests and notables, including Brantford Mayor Richard Beckett, Robert W. Gray of the Maple Leaf Chapter of the Telephone Pioneers of America, Jack E. Skinner of the Bell Canada, Alderman Andrew Donaldson of the Bell Homestead Committee, Don J. Southcott of Northern Electric, Bell Telephone of Canada historian Robert Spencer, and Boston University Professor Robert V. Bruce, who was some two years away from the release of his definitive biography on the younger Bell (titled as Bell: Alexander Graham Bell and The Conquest of Solitude). Bell Historian Robert Spencer provided the assembly with a detailed description of the three phases of restoration that was then underway at the Homestead. After the Henderson Home was transferred to its new Homestead location in 1969 it was then renovated and converted to a telephone museum, with exhibits of early telephone and switchboard technology stretching back to the 1880s. The museum's exhibits were developed in cooperation with Bell Canada, the Canadian successor to the phone company established by Melville with Reverend Henderson's assistance, after Alexander Graham gave his father 75% of the Canadian patent rights to the invention. The exhibits included a model of the nation's first telephone factory, a three-story building established by some of Bell's friends in Brantford, Thomas Cowherd and his son James. Other artifacts included telephone components, an original 'telephone exchange' or switchboard, and early model telephones leading up to the Contempra telephone produced by Bell Canada's affiliate equipment manufacturer, Nortel. In 1973 Bell Canada also later offered an \\"extensive and valuable\\" collection of telephone and telecommunications equipment on permanent loan for display in the museum. Renovations planned in the early 1970s time included the conversion of its ground floor into a telephone museum and its upper floor rooms into a residence for the Homestead's caretakers, who were then residing on the upper level of Melville House, thus allowing the complete restoration of those rooms to their original condition as part of the Melville House museum. In 1971 Ontario Minister James W. Snow, in front of Brantford Mayor Howard Winter, Alderman Andrew Donaldson, chairman of the Bell Homestead Committee, plus Bell Historian Robert H. Spencer and other dignitaries, commemorated the Henderson Home with a historical marker plaque standing freely in front of the building (see photo above). Snow stated to an assembly of more than a hundred \\"This simple frame structure, less than 100 years ago, was the cradle of the telephone business.... The plaque pays tribute to a giant among inventors\\". Reverend Thomas Henderson was himself memorialized earlier in June 1954 at Perth, Ontario's Elmwood Cemetery by a large gathering of Telephone Pioneers of America members attending a three-day conference in the city where Henderson was interred after his death. Approximately 200 dignitaries, Pioneers and others attended a graveside memorial service where a plaque in his memory was unveiled, in a service also attended by Henderson's great-granddaughter.  Renovations, restorations and expansion  The Homestead complex and Melville House have been renovated and restored several times: first in the early 20th century, then in the early 1970s (in three phases in preparation for the centennial of the telephone's invention) as well as in 1994, and finally in the late 1990s to revert changes made at the Homestead by its subsequent owners after Alexander Graham's parents departed in 1881. Later restorations were also meant to provide the home with a more authentic and less museum-like experience. The Bell Telephone Company of Canada (renamed to Bell Canada in 1968), which had provided financial and other support to the Homestead since 1921, assigned its own historian to head the Homestead's restoration committee in 1969. Bell Canada additionally built a caretaker's house on the site and helped finance other renovations and commemorative projects. Other improvements included a return to the home's original cream and green exterior paint scheme, as existed when the Bells lived there. Phase I and Phase II renovations of the early 1970s included the transfer of the Henderson Home from downtown Brantford to its new foundation at the homestead and its conversion into a museum, plus the restoration of Melville House's ground floor, and the rebuilding of the greenhouse conservatory that had been removed during the 1920s (likely when the farmhouse was moved 25 metres away from the eroding bluffs overlooking the Grand River). The house's verandah and chimneys were also rebuilt at that time. Phase III of the campaign was meant to also transfer the caretaker's residence from the upper level of Melville House to the upper level of the Henderson Home to allow for the complete restoration of the farmhouse to its original condition when the Bells resided there. However an extra $60,000 of funding became available for the construction of a new caretaker's cottage, described as \\"a typical little Ontario house with two bedrooms\\", as well as new public washroom facilities. The Homestead's curator, Mr. C. E. Studier, and his wife were at the time residing on the upper level of Melville House. Plans were also being drawn up then to renovate the coach house which was then providing the food and drink concessions area for visitors. Also under consideration was a possible larger telecommunications museum of a national stature. Considerable efforts were made to have the phased renovations completed in time for the 1974 centennial year celebrations of the telephone's invention, during which visitor admissions to the Homestead totaled some 100,000 people. Restoration and new facilities work progressed across the Homestead through the years. In 2005 its carriage house was dismantled and the rebuilt in 2007 at a cost of $75,000. The mid-1980s saw the expansion of the Homestead's general facilities, including a new visitor's reception centre and mini-theatre added for slide and movie presentations. In 1998 the Homestead museum's curator, Brian Wood, viewed hundreds of letters written by the Bells at the Alexander Graham Bell Museum archive in Baddeck, Nova Scotia, and used those writings to determine the true layout of the Homestead and its farmhouse rooms during the family's tenure. The Bell Homestead eventually acquired many of the Bell letters between Alexander Graham and his mother, enabling the museum to accurately recreate the Homestead as it existed during the period of Melville's ownership. In 2002 the Homestead converted its former caretaker's cottage into a tea room cum café, launched on 2 July as the Bell Homestead Café at a cost of approximately $56,000 in order to serve hot meals and fresh baked goods to visitors, with its staff dressed in period-era costumes. Further renovations planned for the homestead in 2003 included work on its carriage house, pantry and scullery, as well as the development of a master plan for the entire complex.  Commemorations  Federal plaque unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II in 1997, marking the Bell Homestead a National Historic Site During an elaborate public ceremony before a crowd numbering in the thousands, the Homestead and the Bell Telephone Memorial were both formally presented to the City of Brantford on Wednesday, October 24, 1917, by Victor Cavendish, the Duke of Devonshire, then Governor General of Canada. A city- wide holiday was declared on that day in honour of the event. Several commemorations have been held at the Homestead honouring the 1874 invention of the telephone at the site by their son, Alexander Graham Bell, the Bell family themselves, and other events related to the Bell System. In 1997 Queen Elizabeth II visited the Homestead and unveiled a commemorative plaque, reflecting its National Historic Site status. = Centennial of Bell's birth, 1947 = In 1947 the Homestead hosted a live radio broadcast, with Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King addressing a dinner of invited guests. Speakers and guests included Alexander Graham's daughter, Mrs. David Fairchild and J.A.D. McCurdy of the Aerial Experiment Association, Transportation Minister Chevrier, Chancellor H.J. Cody of the University of Toronto and Dr. Jack Mackenzie, president of the National Research Council. The Post Office Department issued a stamp to mark Bell's birth centennial on March 3, 1947—a four-cent commemorative, featuring Bell's portrait crowned by an allegorical figure, Fame, standing on a globe showing much of North America. Telephone lines appear in the background. Another stamp honouring Bell was issued on March 17, 2000, as part of Canada Post's millennium collection, showing Bell working, surrounded by images of projects he worked on at Cape Breton (the Silver Dart, a person-carrying kite, hydrofoil). = 75th year Bell Telephone Company commemoration, 1953 = In September 1953 ceremonies were held at the Bell Homestead in the 75th anniversary year of the Bell Telephone Company, formally incorporated in Massachusetts on July 30, 1878. A cut stone monument in the form of a memorial cairn was presented by Professor Fred Landon of London, Ontario, former Vice President of the University of Western Ontario and Chair of the Historic Sites and Monument Board of Canada. The cairn was transferred to the City of Brantford's Board of Park Management in front of Mayor Howard E. Winter, Brant County Warden Stanley Force, representatives of the Charles Fleetford Sise Chapter of the Telephone Pioneers of American and large numbers of the public. Alexander Graham Bell's granddaughters Lilian Grosvenor Coville of Washington, D.C. (who arrived directly from the Bell estate at Baddeck, Nova Scotia) and Nancy Bell Fairchild Bates of Ann Arbor, Michigan, unveiled the monument and bronze plaque. Celebrations included a municipal holiday in Brantford designated as the \\"Bell Homestead Day\\" and an 80-member choir provided a musical program. In their public address to the 1,000 people who attended the unveiling, Bell's granddaughters described his family as all being highly accomplished pianists and singers. Many musical celebrations were held at the homestead during the family's residence, including a \\"musical orgy\\" lasting two to three days. The Bell's musicfests had included four-handed piano duets and recitations of Scottish ballads, combined with the acting of various scenes from Hamlet, Macbeth and Julius Caesar. Grosvenor Coville also spoke extensively of her grandfather's and great-grandfather's dedication to the education of the deaf (the younger Bell, with his father's financial assistance, founded the Volta Bureau in 1887, later renamed as the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing) At the ceremony's conclusion Bates and Coville were presented with gold-plated miniature telephones by Brenda Winter, niece of Brantford Mayor Howard Winter, in appreciation for their assistance in the unveiling. The cairn and commemoration events were the culmination of some 15 years of preparatory work. For unknown reasons the formal paperwork registering the site at the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board in Ottawa was not submitted at the time, an omission which was later discovered and completed in 1996. = Centennial of the first long-distance call, 1976 = On August 10, 1976, Bell Canada and the Bell System helped celebrate the centennial of the first long-distance call with a commemorative service broadcast live from the Homestead to Vancouver, British Columbia, via a Telesat communications satellite. A large satellite dish was set up on the lawn in front of Melville House for the purpose. The event being celebrated was Alexander Graham Bell's \\"three great tests of the telephone\\", which culminated with the call he received on August 10, 1876, in Paris, from his father and others speaking to him from the Dominion Telegraph Office in Brantford. For that long-distance test the younger Bell set up a telephone using telegraph lines at Robert White's Boot and Shoe Store running through the Dominion Telegraph office in Paris. The normal telegraph line of about 13 km (8 miles) length between Paris and Brantford was extended a further 93 km (58 miles) to Toronto to allow the use of a battery in its telegraph office. A similar celebration organized by the Telephone Pioneers of America had been held earlier on the telephone call's 91st anniversary in August 1967, with the ceremonies being broadcast live from the site by a microwave transmitter. = 75th Homestead anniversary, 1985 = In June 1985 the Bell Homestead celebrated its 75th year since its doors opening in October 1910, attended by some 1,000 guests and visitors. Included was a new exhibit of telephone technology in the Henderson Home museum, hosted by Bell Canada and Northern Telecom. The celebration's entertainment featured Scottish highland dancers, a Gaelic choir, an actor portraying a young Alexander Graham Bell in period costume (who was compelled to remove his beard due to the very hot weather), and The Softshoers, a native dance ensemble from the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation Reserve No. 5 School close by. = National Historic Site plaque unveiling, 1997 = On June 28, 1997, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Homestead and unveiled a commemorative plaque, reflecting its designation it as a National Historic Site. She was assisted by a Brantford native, the Honourable Jane Stewart, M.P., the federal Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. Some 2,000-3,000 visitors attended the ceremony, including Brantford Mayor Chris Friel, Six Nations First Nations Chief Wellington Staats, New Credit First Nations Chief Larry Sault, Bell Canada president John McLennan, members of Brantford's Royal Canadian Legion, plus several of Alexander Graham Bell's descendants, including his great-grandson, Hugh Bell Muller, plus Muller's new infant grandson Andrew Joseph Bell Muller. After signing the Homestead's official guestbook upon her arrival (as \\"Elizabeth R\\") she toured the Homestead, with its museum exhibits and displays being explained by students from the city's Graham Bell School. She was presented with a gift antique daffodil phone after being further greeted by Brantford native Ron Johnson, M.P.P., and then departed to meet Prime Minister Jean Chrétien at a reception with 1,000 invited guests. After the queen's departure, the president of the Royal Canadian Mint presented Alexander Graham Bell's youngest descendant, seven-week-old Andrew Joseph Bell Muller, with a $100 gold coin issued that year in tribute to the 150th anniversary of the birth of his famous ancestor. The earlier laying of a commemorative cairn in 1953, unveiled by two of Bell's granddaughters, led to the impression that the site had been designated a National Historic Site—which was not the case, as the cairn was meant to commemorate the invention of the telephone as a National Historic Event. The lack of a historic site designation was uncovered in the early 1990s and approximately five years of paperwork was undertaken to receive its official status from Ottawa.  Heritage designation  As stated by Parks Canada, the Homestead received its designation because: * \\"it is associated with consequential events in Alexander Graham Bell's life, specifically the conception of and early long-distance trials of the telephone\\" * \\"it illuminates the formative influence of Bell's parents, who stimulated his interest in working with the deaf - an interest that was fundamental to the development of the telephone\\" * \\"it has also attained a symbolic importance as the Canadian site most widely associated with the telephone.\\" Its character defining elements include: * \\"its setting on a large rural lot overlooking the Grand River\\" * \\"those elements which speak to its association with the Bell family, including the house with its vernacular British classical design, its centre-hall plan with a kitchen and an east wing, its stucco finish, its surviving original exterior and interior forms and materials, the carriage house with its original form and surviving materials, and the surviving suburban lot typical of 19th-century domestic landscapes\\" * \\"...the relatively intact condition of the house and of the quiet, contemplative atmosphere of the property which has been maintained since the time of the Bell family occupation.\\" The Province of Ontario designated it a Heritage Property under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act, and listed it within a Heritage Conservation District designated under Part V of the same act.  Administration  The Homestead was originally purchased in 1909 by the Bell Telephone Memorial Association with funds collected principally to create the Bell Telephone Memorial. After the Homestead was deeded to the City of Brantford it was operated jointly by the Brantford Board of Park Management with the Telephone Pioneers of America's Charles Fleetford Sise Chapter covering Quebec and Ontario. The Homestead opened its doors to the public in 1910.http://www.bellhomestead.ca/Pages/default.aspx Today, the Homestead is under the administration of the City of Brantford's Parks and Recreation Department, with an average of about 45,000 people visiting the site annually through to the mid-1980s, although it received some 100,000 visitors during the Homestead's bicentennial year celebration in 1974.

RGMVP believes that \\"the poor have a strong desire and innate ability to overcome poverty\\". It aims to organise poor rural women into community institutions and promotes financial inclusion, health-care, livelihood enhancement, education and environment. Vision and mission RGMVP has highlighted its vision \\"to reduce poverty in India through women as the central change-agents\\". The stated Mission of the organisation is \\"to empower poor women by helping them overcome poverty and discrimination through community institutions in the form of SHGs\\". The organisation thus, seeks to provide the women a platform through which they can access their rights and entitlements, and social and development initiatives can be executed effectively. Model and strategies =Community Institutions of the Poor= RGMVP aims to organise the rural women and build their institutions to enable them to overcome poverty and channelize their collective strength to access information, services and entitlements.http://www.indianexpress.com/news/seeds-rahul-sowed-promise-to- bear-fruit-not-all-of-it-sweet/901319/2 These institutions are organized in a three tier system of Self-Help Groups (SHGs), Village Organizations (VOs) and Block Organizations (BOs). An SHG usually consists of 10–20 poor women, typically from similar socio-economic backgrounds. All SHGs mobilized at the village level are federated into Village Organizations (VOs), representing 150 to 250 poor families drawn from 10 to 20 SHGs. The VOs in turn are federated into Block Organizations (BOs) representing 5000 to 7000 women. These institutions aim to act as a systemic interface between poor people and development initiatives. =Strategies= The key strategies of RGMVP include social mobilization, building of social capital, synergy and convergence, scaling up and the saturation approach. Programmes =Financial inclusion= RGMVP enables the poor to build capital through their own savings within the SHGs and access credit through SHG-bank linkages.http://forbesindia.com/article/financial-inclusion/beyond-micro- lending/19062/0 It has garnered support from 17 rural and central banks in its project areas. =Livelihoods= The main focus of RGMVP is on promotion of income generation activities through providing backward linkages to the livelihood activities through specific initiatives on agriculture and dairy, livestock management and non-farm activities to ensure that every poor household has at least two or three sources of income.

Epigenetic gene regulation often involves the physical marking (chemical modification) of DNA or associated proteins to cause or allow long-lasting changes in gene activity. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modifications (methylation, acetylation, and deacetylation) have been shown to play an important role in learning and memory. DNA Methylation DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to a 5' cytosine residue. This usually occurs at cytosines that form part of a cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG sites). Methylation can lead to activation or repression of gene transcription and is mediated through the activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). DNMT3A and DNMT3B regulate de novo methylation of CpG sites, while DNMT1 maintains established methylation patterns. S-adenosyl methionine acts as the methyl donor. The current hypothesis for how DNA methylation contributes to the storage of memories is that dynamic DNA methylation changes occur temporally to activate transcription of genes that encode for proteins whose role is to stabilize memory. =DNMTs and Memory= Miller and Sweatt demonstrated that rats trained in a contextual fear conditioning paradigm had elevated levels of mRNA for DNMT3a and DNMT3b in the hippocampus. Fear conditioning is an associative memory task where a context, like a room, is paired with an aversive stimulus, like a foot shock; animals who have learned the association show higher levels of freezing behavior when exposed to the context even in the absence of the aversive stimulation. However, when rats were treated with the DNMT inhibitors zebularine or 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine immediately after fear-conditioning, they demonstrated reduced learning (freezing behavior). When treated rats were re-trained 24 hours later, they performed as well as non-treated rats. Furthermore, it was shown that when these DNMT inhibitors were given 6 hours after training, and the rats were tested 24 hours later, the rats displayed normal fear memory, indicating that DNMTs are involved specifically in memory consolidation. These findings reveal the importance of dynamic changes in methylation status in memory formation. Feng et al. created double conditional knock out (DKO) mice for the genes DNMT3a and DNMT1. These mice were shown to have significantly weakened long-term potentiation (LTP) and much more easily stimulated long- term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus. When tested in the Morris water navigation task, which is used to study hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, the DNMT3a/DNMT1 DKO mice took longer to find the platform than control mice. Single knock-out mice (SKO) for either DNMT3a or DNMT1 performed normally. DKO mice were also unable to consolidate memory after fear-conditioning. Since SKO mice did not exhibit the same learning and memory defects as the DKO mice, it was concluded that DNMT3a and DNMT1 play redundant roles in regulating learning and memory. When DNMTs are inhibited in the prefrontal cortex, recall of existing memories is impaired, but not the formation of new ones. This indicates that DNA methylation may be circuit-specific when it comes to regulating the formation and maintenance of memories. =DNA Methylation Targets= The memory suppressor gene, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), was shown to have increased CpG island methylation after contextual-fear conditioning. This corresponded to decreased levels of PP1 mRNA in the hippocampus of the trained rats. When DNMTs were inhibited, increased methylation at the PP1 gene was no longer observed. These data suggest that during memory consolidation in associative learning tasks, CpG methylation is used to inhibit the expression of PP1, a gene that negatively inhibits memory formation. =Demethylation and Memory= While DNA methylation is necessary to inhibit genes involved in memory suppression, DNA demethylation is important in activating genes whose expression is positively correlated with memory formation. Sweatt and Miller also showed that the gene reelin, which is involved in long term potentiation induction, had a reduced methylation profile and increased reelin mRNA in fear-conditioned versus control rats. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), another important gene in neural plasticity, has also been shown to have reduced methylation and increased transcription in animals that have undergone learning. While these studies have been linked to the hippocampus, recent evidence has also shown increased demethylation of reelin and BDNF in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an area involved in cognition and emotion. The mechanism behind this experience-dependent demethylation response was previously not fully understood, with some evidence showing that DNMTs may be involved in demethylation. It was also suggested that members of the DNA damage repair GADD45 family may contribute to this demethylation process. However, more recently, the pathways illustrated in the Figure below, titled \\"Demethylation of 5-Methylcytosine (5mC) in neuron DNA,\\" especially the TET dependent pathway, have been confirmed as pathways of DNA demethylation. A role for GADD45 has also recently been indicated, since GADD45 physically interacts with thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) and GADD45 may promote the activity of TDG in its role(s) during conversion of 5mC to cytosine. =Methyl-Binding Domain Proteins (MBDs)= Mice that have genetic disruptions for CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) have been shown to have significant problems in hippocampus#Role in memory-dependent memory and have impaired hippocampal LTP. =Methylation and Learning and Memory Disorders= Changes in expression of genes associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by an impaired extinction of traumatic memory, may be mediated by DNA methylation. In schizophrenics, it has been shown that reelin is down- regulated through increased DNA methylation at promoter regions in GABAergic interneurons. DNMT1 has also been shown to be upregulated in these cells. Histone methylation Methylation of histones may either increase or decrease gene transcription depending on which histone is modified, the amino acid that is modified, and the number of methyl groups added. In the case of lysine methylation, three types of modifications exist: monomethylated, dimethylated, or trimethylated lysines. The di- or trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) has been associated with transcriptionally silent regions, while the di- or trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) is associated with transcriptionally active genes. =Histone 3 Lysine 4 Trimethylation and Memory Formation= The hippocampus is an important brain region in memory formation. H3K4 trimethylation is associated with active transcription. In contextual fear conditioning experiments in rats, it was found that levels of H3K4 trimethylation increases in the hippocampus after fear conditioning. In these experiments by Gupta et al., a connection was made between changes in histone methylation and active gene expression during the consolidation of associative memories. In this same study, it was also found that these histone methylations were reversible, as the levels of trimethylation of H3K4 returned to basal levels after a period of 24 hours. This indicated that active demethylation was occurring following memory consolidation. To further explore the role of methyltransferases in long-term memory formation, this study applied the same fear conditioning tests on rats deficient in Mll, a H3K4-specific methyltransferase. The rats with a heterozygous mutant Mll+/- gene showed a significant reduction in their ability to form long-term memories compared to normal rats with an intact Mll gene. Therefore, H3K4 methyltransferases, such as Mll, must have an essential role in long-term memory formation in the hippocampus. The change in methylation state of histones at the location of specific gene promoters, as opposed to just genome-wide, is also involved in memory formation. Zif268 and BDNF genes are critical for memory consolidation. H3K4 trimethylation increases around both of the Zif268 and BDNF promoters following contextual fear conditioning, when these genes are transcriptionally active. This demonstrates that at the time of memory consolidation, the transcription of memory formation genes such as Zif268 and bdnf is regulated by histone methylation. =Histone 3 Lysine 9 Dimethylation and Memory Formation= Histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation is associated with transcriptional silencing. The G9a/G9a-like protein (GLP) complex is a methyltransferase specific for producing this modification. One study examined the role of G9a/GLP-mediated transcriptional silencing in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) during memory consolidation. It was found that the inhibition of G9a/GLP in the EC, but not in the hippocampus, results in the enhancement of long-term memory formation. In addition, G9a/GLP inhibition in the entorhinal cortex altered histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation in the Cornu Ammonis area 1 of the hippocampus, suggesting the importance of this complex in mediating connectivity between these two brain regions. Therefore, the G9a/GLP complex plays an important role in histone methylation and long term memory formation in the hippocampus and the EC. =Histone Methylation and Other Epigenetic Modifications= Histone methylation marks are also correlated with other epigenetic modifications, such as histone deacetylation and DNA methylation, in the context of learning and memory. Reduced histone deacetylation is correlated with an increase in H3K9 dimethylation, a modification associated with transcriptional silencing. Therefore, histone deacetylase inhibitors may be applied to increase histone acetylation and suppress H3K9 dimethylation, thereby increasing gene transcription. In the case of DNA methylation, it was found that increases in H3K4 trimethylation correlate with altered DNA methylation of CpG sites at the promoter of Zif268, a gene involved in memory formation, after fear conditioning. Gupta et al. showed that DNA methylation at the Zif268 promoter increased after fear conditioning, correlating with an increase in Zif268 gene expression. This finding was surprising, since it was previously thought that DNA methylation resulted in transcriptional silencing. Histone Acetylation Acetylation involves the replacement of a hydrogen with an acetyl group. In a biological context, acetylation is most often associated with the modification of proteins, specifically histones. The acetylation reaction is most often catalyzed by enzymes that contain histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. =Histone acetyltransferases (HATs)= HATs are enzymes responsible for the acetylation of amino acids. HATs acetylate by converting the lysine side group of amino acids with the addition of an acetyl group from an acetyl CoA molecule, creating acetyl lysine. HAT enzymes are most often associated with histone proteins and work to regulate the interaction between histones and the DNA that is wrapped around them. HATs are not only restricted to the acetylation of histone but can also acetylate many other proteins implicated in the manipulation of gene expression like that of transcription factors and receptor proteins. =Chromatin Remodeling= Acetylation is one of the main mechanisms implicated in the process of chromatin remodeling. Chromatin remodeling affects the regulation of gene expression by altering the relationship between nucleosomes and DNA. Acetylation of histones removes positive charge, which reduces the level of interaction between the formerly positively charged histone and the negatively charged phosphate groups of the DNA wrapped around the nucleosome complex. This alteration in charges causes a relaxation of DNA from the nucleosome, this relaxed section is seen to have higher levels of gene expression than non acetylated regions. =Acetylation as an epigenetic marker= Patterns of histone acetylation have been useful as a source of epigenetic information due to their ability to reflect changes in transcription rates and the maintenance of gene expression patterns. This acetylation code can then be read and provide generous information for the study of inheritance patterns of epigenetic changes like that of learning, memory and disease states. =Acetlylation as a mechanism for learning and memory= The role of epigenetic mechanisms and chromatin remodeling has been implicated in both synaptic plasticity and neuronal gene expression. Studies with histone deactylase complex inhibitors like SAHA, toluene, garcinol, trichostatin A and sodium butyrate have shown that acetylation is important for the synaptic plasticity of the brain; by inhibiting deactylase complexes total acetylation rates in the brain increased leading to increased rates of transcription and enhanced memory consolidation. By using various learning assays like the Morris water maze test and fear conditioning assays in conjunction with acetlyation influencing drugs it was shown that acetylation patterns in the hippocampus are integral to memory association and learning behavior. Studies with various HDAC inhibitors and neural development have shown increased learning and memory, as a result of an increased acetylation state. Conversely studies conducted with HAT inhibitors yielded impairment of memory consolidation and an overall decrease in learning. =ERK/MAPK Cascade= Studies have shown that the ERK/MAPK cascade is important for the regulation of lysine acetylation in the insular cortex of the brain (A part of the brain implicated in the formation of taste memories). The activation of the ERK/MAPK cascade was seen in mice after the introduction of a new taste, the cascade was shown to be necessary for the memory of the taste to be formed. The proposed mechanism for how this cascade works is that MAPK regulates histone acetylation and subsequent chromatin remodeling by means of downstream effectors, such as the CREB binding protein (which has HAT activity). By observing the rates of acetylation in the insular cortex researchers were able to determine which patterns of acetylation were due to deacetylase or acetylase activity and which were a result of lysine acetyltransferase activity. =Long Term Potentiation= Long term potentiation (LTP) is the enhancement of signal strength between neurons. LTP is the basis of synaptic plasticity and plays a pivotal role in memory formation. LTP is dependent on the activity of NMDA receptors in the brain and it has been shown that NMDA activity influences acetylation. When NMDA receptors are activated they cause an influx of calcium into the cell which in turn activates various signal pathways that ultimately activate the ERK pathway which then modulates transcription factors like CREB. CREB then recruits a HAT to help create and stabilize the long term formation of memory, often through the self- perpetuation of acetylated histones. Studies done on Acetylation of histone H3 in the CA1 region of the hippocampus show that the activation of NMDA receptors increased the acetylation of H3 and conversely inhibition of the ERK pathway in the CA1 region resulted in a decrease in acetylation of H3. In summary: * NMDA-R activation increases phosphorylation of ERK and Acetylation of Histone H3 * Memory requires proper NMDA-R function * Memory conditioning increases phosphorylation of ERK and acetylation of Histone H3 * ERK is regulated by phosphorylation * Histone H3 acetylation is regulated by ERK * Histone H4 is not regulated by ERK * HDAC inhibitors enhance LTP, this is dependent on rate of transcription * HDAC inhibitors do not affect NMDA-R Histone Deacetylation =HDACs' Role in CREB: CBP-Dependent Transcriptional Activation= 500px Histone deacetylases (HDAC) remove acetyl groups (-COCH3) from histones altering chromatin structures and decreasing accessibility of transcriptional factors to DNA, thereby reducing transcription of genes. HDACs have shown to play a role in learning and memory through their regulation in the CREB-CBP pathway. Studies conclude that HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A (TSA) increase histone acetylation and improve synaptic plasticity and long-term memory (Fig 1A). CREB, a cAMP response element-binding protein and transcriptional activator, binds CBP forming the CREB: CBP complex. This complex activates genes involved in synaptic formation and long-term memory.(Fig 1B) TSA treatments in the hippocampal CA1 region of mice increased acetylation levels and enhanced long- term potentiation (LTP), a mechanism involved in learning and memory (Fig 1B). However, TSA treatments in CBP mutants lacking KIX domains did not effect LTP in mice (Fig 1D). The KIX domain allows for interaction between CREB and CBP, so knocking out this region disrupts formation of the CREB: CBP complex. Knock outs of CREB produced similar results to those of mutant CBP mice (Fig 1C). Therefore, HDAC inhibition and CREB: CBP association are both necessary for memory development. TSA treatments showed increased expression levels of Nr4a1 and Nra2 genes while other CREB regulated genes were unaffected. HDAC inhibitors improve memory through activation of specific genes regulated by CREB: CBP complex. =HDAC2= The role of individual HDACs in learning and memory is not well understood, but HDAC2 has been shown to negatively regulate memory formation and synaptic plasticity. Overexpression (OE) of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in mice resulted in decreased levels of acetylated lysines. After exposing these mice to context and tone-dependent fear conditioning experiments, HDAC1 OE mice did not change, but HDAC2 OE mice showed a decrease in freezing behavior, suggesting impairment in memory formation. On the other hand, mice with HDAC2 knockouts (KO) illustrated increased freezing levels compared to wild-type (WT) mice while HDAC1 displayed similar freezing behaviors to WTs. In summary, Guan et al. have shown that: * HDAC2, not HDAC1, regulates synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. HDAC2 overexpression decreases spine density in CA1 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cells but HDAC2 KO show an increase in spine density. * Long term potentiation in CA1 neurons was not observed in HDAC2 OE mice but was easily induced in HDAC2 KO mice. LTP was not altered between HDAC1 KO and OE mice. * HDAC2 suppresses neuronal gene expression. HDAC2 interacted more than HDAC1 with specific memory-forming promoters such as Bdnf, Egr1, Fos, and GLUR1. * CoREST, a co-repressor, associates with HDAC2 not HDAC1. * SAHA, a HDAC inhibitor, increased freezing of HDAC2 OE mice in contextual fear and tone dependent experiments, but did not effect HDAC2 KO mice suggesting HDAC2 is major target of SAHA =HDAC3= HDAC3 is also a negative regulator of long term potentiation formation. McQuown et al. have shown that: * KOs of HDAC3 in dorsal hippocampus resulted in enhanced memory during object location tests (OLM). * RGFP136, HDAC3 inhibitor, enhances LTP for object recognition and location * RGFP136 enhances LTP through CBP-dependent mechanism * HDAC3 deletions showed increased Nr4a2 and c-Fos expression * HDAC3 interacts with NCoR and HDAC4 to perform its role in memory formation =HDACs’ Role in CNS disorders= Research has shown that HDACs and HATs play a crucial role in central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Rett syndrome. Rubinstein-Tabyi syndrome causes mental retardation through possible mutations in CREB-binding protein and p300. However, enhancing expression of CREB-dependent genes or inhibition of HDAC activity partially restore LTP loss and ameliorate late LTP deficits. HDAC inhibitor like TSA may provide a possible therapy for Rubinstein-Tabyi syndrome. Other memory-deficit disorders which may involve HDAC inhibitors as potential therapy are: * Friedreich's ataxia * Spinal muscular atrophy * Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis * Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy * Huntington's disease * Spinocerebellar ataxias * Dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy * Alzheimer's disease * Niemann Pick type C disease Roles of ROS and OGG1 in memory and learning Initiation of DNA demethylation at a CpG site. In adult somatic cells DNA methylation typically occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides (CpG sites), forming 5-methylcytosine-pG, or 5mCpG. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may attack guanine at the dinucleotide site, forming 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and resulting in a 5mCp-8-OHdG dinucleotide site. The base excision repair enzyme OGG1 targets 8-OHdG and binds to the lesion without immediate excision. OGG1, present at a 5mCp-8-OHdG site recruits TET1 and TET1 oxidizes the 5mC adjacent to the 8-OHdG. This initiates demethylation of 5mC. Demethylation of 5-Methylcytosine (5mC) in neuron DNA. As reviewed in 2018, in brain neurons, 5mC is oxidized by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases (TET1, TET2, TET3) to generate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). In successive steps TET enzymes further hydroxylate 5hmC to generate 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) recognizes the intermediate bases 5fC and 5caC and excises the glycosidic bond resulting in an apyrimidinic site (AP site). In an alternative oxidative deamination pathway, 5hmC can be oxidatively deaminated by activity- induced cytidine deaminase/apolipoprotein B mRNA editing complex (AID/APOBEC) deaminases to form 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) or 5mC can be converted to thymine (Thy). 5hmU can be cleaved by TDG, single-strand-selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 (SMUG1), Nei-Like DNA Glycosylase 1 (NEIL1), or methyl-CpG binding protein 4 (MBD4). AP sites and T:G mismatches are then repaired by base excision repair (BER) enzymes to yield cytosine (Cyt). The identified areas of the human brain that are involved in memory formation. As reviewed by Massaad and Klann in 2011 and by Beckhauser et al. in 2016, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are required for normal learning and memory functions. One of the most frequent DNA oxidation products of ROS is 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Removal of oxidized bases in DNA usually occurs in a matter of minutes, with a half-life of 11 minutes for 8-OHdG. Steady-state levels of endogenous DNA damages represent the balance between formation and repair. 8-OHdGs are among the most frequent DNA damages present in the steady-state, with about 2,400 8-OHdG damaged nucleotides in the average mammalian cell. The steady state 8-OHdG level in the brain is similar to that in other tissues. The occurrence of 8-OHdG in neurons appears to have a role in memory and learning. The DNA glycosylase oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1) is the primary enzyme responsible for the excision of 8-OHdG in base excision repair. However, OGG1, which targets and associates with 8-OHdG, also has a role in adaptive behavior, which implies a physiologically relevant role for 8-OHdG combined with OGG1 in cognition in the adult brain. In particular, heterozygous OGG1+/- mice, with about half the protein level of OGG1, exhibit poorer learning performance in the Barnes maze compared to wild-type animals. In adult somatic cells, such as neurons, DNA methylation typically occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides (CpG sites), forming 5-methylcytosine (5mC). Thus, a CpG site may be methylated to form 5mCpG. The presence of 5mC at CpG sites in gene promoters is widely considered to be an epigenetic mark that acts to suppress transcription. If the guanine at the 5mCpG site is attacked by ROS, leading to 8-OHdG formation, OGG1 binds to the 8-OHdG lesion without immediate excision of the 8-OHdG. When OGG1 is present at a 5mCp-8-OHdG site, it recruits TET1 to the 8-OHdG lesion and TET1 oxidizes the 5mC adjacent to 8-OHdG. This causes the 5mC to enter the DNA demethylation pathway (see Figure titled \\"Initiation of DNA demethylation at a CpG site\\"). This pathway is initiated by formation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, which may remain in the DNA, or there may be further oxidative reactions followed by base excision repair, to return the nucleoside at that position to cytosine (see Figure \\"Demethylation of 5-Methylcytosine (5mC) in neuron DNA\\"). The total number of CpG sites in the human genome is approximately 28 million and the average frequency of CpG sites in the genome is about 1 per hundred base pairs. An intense learning situation can be applied to rats, referred to as contextual fear conditioning. This can result in a life-long fearful memory after a single training event. While the long-term memory of this event appears to be first stored in the hippocampus, this storage is transient and does not remain in the hippocampus. Much of the long term storage of contextual fear conditioning memory appears to take place in the anterior cingulate cortex. (See the Figure showing identified areas of the human brain that are involved in memory formation and also this reference .) When contextual fear conditioning is applied to a rat, more than 5,000 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (of 500 nucleotides each) occur in the rat hippocampus neural genome both one hour and 24 hours after the conditioning in the hippocampus. This causes about 500 genes to be up-regulated (often due to hypomethylation of CpG sites) and about 1,000 genes to be down-regulated (often due to newly formed 5mC at CpG sites in a promoter region). The pattern of induced and repressed genes within neurons appears to provide a molecular basis for forming this first transient memory of this training event in the hippocampus of the rat brain. When similar contextual fear conditioning is applied to a mouse, one hour after contextual fear conditioning there were 675 demethylated genes and 613 hypermethylated genes in the hippocampus region of the mouse brain. These changes were transient in the hippocampal neurons, and almost none were present after four weeks. However, in mice subjected to conditional fear conditioning, after four weeks there were more than 1,000 differentially methylated genes and more than 1,000 differentially expressed genes in the anterior cingulate cortex, where long-term memories are stored in the mouse brain.

Videograf was founded in 1989 by two former New York city graffiti writers Carl Weston and Colin \\"KoolSpin\\" Turner. The inspiration for the Videograf series came during the summer of 1988, from the graffiti zine movement. It was publications like New York City's \\"International Graffiti Times\\" published by David Schmidlapp and Phase2 and the first color graffiti zine from Los Angeles - \\"Can Control Magazine\\" published by Power that planted the idea of doing a videotape version of a fan zine. By February 1989 Videograf issue one was in full production. By the summer of 1989, photographer and graffiti artist William \\"Nic One\\" Green joined the Videograf team as a producer. A year later the future cofounder of Egotrip magazine, writer and television producer Sacha Jenkins joined Videograf as well. The Videograf Productions operation was run out of Henry Chalfant's studio at 64 Grand Street for about 3 years before moving to Greenpoint Brooklyn. Overview Videograf Productions was the first group to produce a recurring video series on the graffiti scene. Most films on graffiti up to this point were traditional documentaries. Videograf Productions used a video magazine format to profile graffiti artist and graffiti bombers. The Videograf series was unusual in that it was produced by active and former graffiti writers. At the time, most people documenting urban culture tended to be from outside the culture. The Videograf series wasn't neutral in how they covered graffiti; they were pro-graffiti from the very start. Carl Weston was very aggressive in documenting the new clean train movement that had started in New York City after the last train with graffiti was pulled from service in April 1989. Graffiti artist and bombers like Ven, Ket and many others would make it their mission to get graffiti back on the New York City transit system. The number one thing that would get Videograf Productions into legal conflicts with the New York City Police Department was the inclusion of clean train bombing. To date, Videograf Productions has produced and distributed over 20 graffiti videos. The original Videograf video series, and later the Graf Core and OverSpray series included interviews with many well known graffiti artists including Zephyr, PHASE 2, Lee Quiñones, Pjay, Ket, Ghost, JA, Death149, Risk, Cope2, Sharp, Reas, Serve, Web, Espo, Kaws, Dash \\"Sace\\" Snow and Dream. Police harassment, arrest and civil rights lawsuit On May 26, 2000 the Police Department's Bronx Vandal Squad unit executed a search warrant on Videograf Productions as they were prepping the release of their newest video titled Graf Core 2000. This police action and the confiscation of Videograf Productions entire videotape archive would delay Graf Core 2000 from being released for almost 4 years. A few months after the warrant was executed the Bronx Vandal Squad arrested William Green and Carl Weston for blurring an image used in the video Graf Core 1.0. The official charge was hindering a criminal investigation. This charge was dropped by the judge the next day. Videograf Productions was able to enlist the help of the ACLU's Norman Siegel and later Earl Ward to represent them in a civil rights lawsuit against the City of New York. Carl Weston went to the Bronx Vandal Squad headquarters a few months after the first search warrant in an attempt to get an on camera interview with anyone from the Vandal Squad, Carl Weston ended up running into officer Joseph \\"Joe Blow\\" Rivera, the interview didn't go very well. The very next day after the failed interview, the Bronx Vandal Squad executed a second search warrant, Carl Weston feels this was largely an act of revenge for videotaping Joseph \\"Joe Blow\\" Rivera face. Four years later the city settled out of court with Videograf Productions.

It is used as a kinetic predecessor data structure, and as a component in more complex kinetic data structures such as kinetic closest pair.  Implementation  This data structure maintains a list of the elements in sorted order, with the certificates enforcing the order between adjacent elements. When a certificate fails, the concerned elements are swapped. Then at most three certificates must be updated, the certificate of the swapped pair, and the two certificates involving the swapped elements and the elements of the sorted list which directly precede and follow the swapped pair. For example, given a sorted list {A,B,C,D,E,F}, the certificates will be [AO(n \\\\log m) time and processes O(\\\\frac{n^2}{m}) events total, assuming pseudo algebraic trajectories, where m is a parameter of the data structure. Thus, a maintenance-time versus query-time tradeoff can be made to tune to specific applications. In the generalized data structure, the points are partitioned arbitrarily into m subsets of size O(\\\\frac{n}{m}), and kinetic sorted lists are maintained on the subsets. Each sorted sublist needs to process O(\\\\frac{n^2}{m^2}) events (certificate failures) maximum, since there are O(1) swaps of each of the O(\\\\frac{n^2}{m^2}) pairs of elements. Thus the total time required to maintain the data structure is O(\\\\frac{n^2}{m}). Requests for the sorted list can then be answered in O(n\\\\log m) by merging the sorted sublists with mergesort.

It forms volatile yellow triclinic crystals and has a sharp odor similar to benzoquinone. It is almost insoluble in cold water, slightly soluble in petroleum ether, and more soluble in polar organic solvents. In alkaline solutions it produces a reddish-brown color. Vitamin K is a derivative of 1,4-naphthoquinone. It is a planar molecule with one aromatic ring fused to a quinone subunit. It is an isomer of 1,2-naphthoquinone. Preparation The industrial synthesis involves aerobic oxidation of naphthalene over a vanadium oxide catalyst: :CH + 3/2 O → CHO + HO In the laboratory, naphthoquinone can be produced by the oxidation of a variety of naphthalene compounds. An inexpensive route involves oxidation of naphthalene with chromium trioxide. Reactions 1,4-Naphthoquinone acts as strong dienophile in Diels-Alder reaction. Its adduct with 1,3-butadiene can be prepared by two methods: 1) long (45 days) exposure of naphthoquinone in neat liquid butadiene taken in huge excess at room temperature in a thick-wall glass tube or 2) fast catalyzed cycloaddition at low temperature in the presence of 1 equivalent of tin(IV) chloride: Diels-Alder reaction of 1,4-naphthoquinone with 1,3-butadiene Uses 1,4-Naphthoquinone is mainly used as a precursor to anthraquinone by reaction with butadiene followed by oxidation. Nitration gives 5-nitro-1,4-naphthalenedione, precursor to an that is used as a dye precursor. Derivatives Naphthoquinone forms the central chemical structure of many natural compounds, most notably the K vitamins. 2-Methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, called menadione, is a more effective coagulant than vitamin K. Other natural naphtoquinones include juglone, plumbagin, droserone. Naphthoquinone derivatives have significant pharmacological properties. They are cytotoxic, they have significant antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticidal, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. Plants with naphthoquinone content are widely used in China and the countries of South America, where they are used to treat malignant and parasitic diseases. Naphthoquinone functions as a ligand through its electrophilic carbon-carbon double bonds. Dichlone, a chlorinated derivative of 1,4-naphthoquinone, is used as a fungicide.

Typically, Chinese heavy metal bands adhere to one subgenres of heavy metal such as death metal, thrash metal, and power metal, but commonly using Chinese-based lyrical content rather than English. History =Tang Dynasty (1988–1990)= Tang Dynasty performing in 2004. Chinese heavy metal had its origins in hard rock (硬摇滚音乐, Yìng yáogǔn yīnyuè) and Heavy Metal (重金属, Zhòngjīnshǔ) music genres, which had emerged and gained popularity around the 1980s in the western world. As a main genre in Mainland China. The genre of Chinese Heavy Metal music emerged with the formation of the Chinese band, Tang Dynasty as they were the first band to emerge in China with Heavy Metal oriented music. Following their initial formation in 1988 Tang Dynasty utilized both elements introduced in the new wave of British heavy metal as well as elements of classical Chinese music in the music they wrote. In 1990 Tang dynasty was hired to play at the, 'Festival of modern music / 90's Modern Music Concert', wherein they were met with extremely positive responses from the crowd of nearly 18,000 spectators. The success gained from their performance eventually led to them obtaining a record contract with the Taiwanese record label, Magic Stone. In December 1992 Tang Dynasty released their debut album, entitled A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty, marking the first release of a heavy metal album in China by a Chinese band. =Development (1991–1999)= In the time following the initial success of 'Tang Dynasty' a number of other Chinese heavy metal bands began to emerge throughout China. The bands emerging during this time period gradually began to adopt a more 'heavier' style of music utilizing more western elements in to their music, as shown by the band Overload's thrash metal debut record in 1996, but still retaining the Chinese lyrical content. 1997–1999 saw a massive rise in the amount of metal bands in China as the amount of new metal bands being formed every year increased from roughly 1-2 to 15 by 1999. The new bands being formed also began to diversify in terms of musical subgenre of heavy metal as many bands began to explore a more Extreme Metal sound rather than the traditional '80's metal sound'. In 1999, the first metal magazine \\"极端音乐(Extreme Music)\\"was founded in Nanjing. Extreme Music Magazine articles feature metal bands and metal culture especially underground metal bands. Extreme Music moved to Beijing in 2006. =Public Recognition (2000–2012)= In September 2000, the first heavy-metal-oriented magazine, Painkiller, was founded in Beijing. The magazine quickly became popular within the heavy metal sub culture in China on account of both its local coverage of metal related subjects as well as due to the inclusion of interview and articles written by foreign correspondents. During June 2001, the record label \\"Mort Productions\\" is founded by some of the members involved in the production and release of the Painkiller. On November 4 Mort productions released the first compilation CD of Chinese heavy metal, namely \\"Resurrection Of The Gods\\" Mort Productions would go on to release a variety of records by Chinese metal bands as well as several metal compilation albums. From the year 2005 and onwards, China began to have several high-profile metal concerts with foreign bands headlining, along with local Chinese bands supporting. The band Labyrinth's performance in Beijing marked the first official metal concert in China by a foreign band. In the following years several foreign bands such as: Edguy, Lacrimosa, Testament, Exodus, In Flames, Nightwish, Dark Tranquility, Dream Theater, Stratovarius, Helloween, Opeth, Lamb Of God, Soulfly, Cannibal Corpse has performed in both Beijing and Shanghai. 2012 marked to be a major statement of recognition for the Chinese metal scene, with several metal bands such as Suffocated being filmed by CCTV 5 and broadcast along the European Championship in Soccer 2012 coverage.As seen on Douban Furthermore, Rock in China released the compilation record CORE IN CHINA that attracted global attention online and is regarded as a milestone for Chinese metal.Global Metal Apocalypse (c) May 2012 review Metalinsider.net (c) June 2012 review In August, three Chinese metal bands ( Suffocated, Yaksa and The Falling) performed on the Wacken Open Air 2012.

They all take place in New England in the late nineteenth century. A book cover of Old Friends and New, by Sarah Orne Jewett from 1907.\\"Jewett Texts.\\" Jewett Texts. Coe College. Web. 13 May 2012. . The cover of Volume 41 of The Atlantic Monthly from January 1878. Jewett's first short story from Old Friends and New, A Lost Lover, appeared in this issue. Plot summary =A Lost Lover= Miss Horatia Dane is a lonely widow who lives in Longfield, far from any family. The narrator reveals a rumor that Miss Dane had a lover who was lost at sea, though she never mentions him. Nelly Dane, the daughter of Miss Horatia’s youngest cousin, comes to stay with Miss Horatia in Longfield. Nelly is extremely helpful around the house, and everyone in this small, rural area loves her. Nelly hears about the rumor of Miss Dane’s deceased lover from one of the townspeople, and promptly asks Melissa, Miss Dane’s servant. Melissa says that Miss Dane has never mentioned this lover, but that she has heard stories “from other folks.”Jewett, Sarah O. Old Friends and New. Gloucestershire: Echo Library, 2010. Print. 8. Melissa says Miss Dane met Joe Carrick when she was visiting her great-aunt in Salem. It was assumed that they were going to marry after he came back from his journey, but the ship never returned. Melissa mentions that Miss Dane had never been interested in pursuing any other men, “on account of her heart’s being buried in the deep with him.”Jewett, Sarah O. Old Friends and New. Gloucestershire: Echo Library, 2010. Print. 11. In an emotional conversation, Miss Dane confirms her loneliness to Nelly, but admits that she is used to it by now. Later that week, a knock is heard at Miss Dane’s door. Melissa opens the door to find a beggar, who is welcomed by Miss Dane. The man tells her that he is a sailor, and has lived on ships ever since he was a boy. After the beggar mentions that he was raised in Salem, Miss Dane’s face becomes pale, and she can only stare at him. She realizes that this man is her lost lover, Joe Carrick, yet he does not recognize her. In the years following this incident, Miss Horatia Dane changes. She takes down the whale tooth that Carrick had given her, which she had displayed in her bedroom since he left on his voyage, and her age begins to show. =A Sorrowful Guest= Jack Ainslie writes his sister, Helen, in 1877, asking if she would like to come to America to live with him, for Jack is very lonely without any family. Their parents had died when they were younger. Jack had gone to college and then into the military, and Helen went to live with her aunt, Alice, in Florence, and remained there after she died. Helen, like her brother, feels lonely now, for she misses her family, so she agrees to come to America. Helen and Jack live a very comfortable and social life. One night, Jack’s friends come to have dinner with Helen and Jack. Helen takes a curious interest in Mr. Whiston, one of Jack’s lifelong friends. She overhears Jack and Whiston speaking about their army days, recalling the death of some of their friends, and notices that Whiston suddenly looks very pale – as if he sees a ghost. After Whiston leaves, Helen, Jack, and George Sheffield – another of Jack’s army comrades – speak about Whiston and his many oddities. They wonder if he is insane, but Jack diagnoses him with monomania instead, referencing one of the many medical journals he keeps in his home. “An object may appear to be present before his eyes which has no existence whatever there.”Jewett, Sarah O. Old Friends and New. Gloucestershire: Echo Library, 2010. Print. 25. Upon their next meeting, Whiston tells Helen that he believes in ghosts, and that, in fact, Henry Dunster – his cousin who died in the war – constantly follows him around. Whiston presents many examples of his hallucinations, but Jack asks if perhaps it is not truly Dunster, for he was only counted as missing during the war. A couple days later, Helen and Jack visit Whiston in a hospital, where he soon dies. Helen is disappointed by the loneliness of the hospital, and reflects on how grateful she is for having such a loving brother and so comfortable a home. Months later, Jack discovers Dunster at the Marine Hospital in Chelsea. Dunster had actually avoided death by crawling out of enemy territory, and though some of Whiston’s hallucinations were, in fact, sightings of Dunster, others were most certainly caused by his monomania. =A Late Supper= Miss Catherine Spring is a lonely, elderly woman who lives in Brookton, among the mountains and country. She had grown up as part of a big family, but everyone had died years before, and she had become accustomed to the solitude. She had been struggling financially, and no one had responded to her advertisement for summer boarders, so she had to think of other options. She writes to a niece in Lowell, requesting to stay with her, but soon learns that her niece will already have a relative staying with them for the summer. Spring’s nephew and his wife come to have dinner with Miss Spring without notifying her beforehand. Her nephew, Joseph, requests some cream for his tea, so Miss Spring crosses the street to her neighbor’s house to accommodate him. Spring's neighbor gives her the cream, but on her walk back across the road, Spring has to cross a train platform, hurrying through the train that is stopped there. Before Miss Spring can climb down the stairs on the other side, however, the train departs, leaving her in a train car with two strangers: Miss Ashton and her niece, Alice West. Miss Spring is concerned that her guests will be worried about her absence, but feels extremely comfortable with these two welcoming women. In fact, the women pay for Miss Spring’s train fare back to Brookton, but Spring promises to return the money, writing down their address. Meanwhile, Miss Spring’s guests are panicking, unable to find her anywhere around, and already pointing to death as the likely cause of absence due to her age. Miss Spring returns home, however, after a very exciting adventure, and receives a letter from Alice West the next day. West requests boarding in Miss Spring’s house, for Ashton and West are unhappy in their summer home in the mountains. Upon receiving this letter, Miss Spring cries for joy, and is excited for her future. Spring is pleased to be staying in her home, instead of moving elsewhere, and is excited to welcome such lovely guests as West and Ashton. =Mr. Bruce= Elly, a young girl without a family, is staying with her aunt Mary near Boston. In trying to comfort Elly, Mary reveals that Elly has not had a great upbringing, as her father has been useless in caring for her. She assures her that Miss Margaret Tennant, one of Mary's close friends, will visit them soon and will take great care of Elly. When Tennant visits, she tells Elly and Mary the story of the first time Kitty, her sister, and Mr. Bruce met. Many years prior, Kitty’s mother received a letter from her husband requesting her to prepare dinner for four business partners that would be joining them for dinner. With such short notice, they did not have enough servants to help serve dinner, so Kitty volunteered to do it as a joke, acting as a servant. One of the guests, an Englishman named Mr. Bruce, caught Kitty’s attention, and the two made eye contact throughout the dinner, though he thought Kitty was just a servant, so he had no interest in talking to her. Several months later, Kitty goes to stay in Baltimore with her aunt, Alice Thornton, to help Alice care for her home. In letters to her sister, Kitty mentions one instance when she is out dancing, and meets an Englishman whom she recognizes and who clearly recognizes her. This man, however, leaves Kitty after they are introduced, and avoids her for the rest of the party. Alice knows the man and tells Kitty his name: Bruce. Alice throws a party at her home, and Mr. Bruce is one of the guests. Kitty wants to get to know him, but he seems hesitant to speak to her. Kitty’s uncle, Rob, returns home to Baltimore with the news that he has invited Mr. Bruce to dinner. When Mr. Bruce shows up, he asks Kitty if she is Mrs. Hunter’s niece, and immediately realizes that Kitty was the servant at the dinner he had attended several months prior. She denies that she was the servant that he spoke of, but could not hold in her laughter. She only realizes that Mr. Bruce was the same Englishman whom she had seen months before at that dinner upon his questioning. They become very close, and when Kitty returns home to Boston, Mr. Bruce joins her. The following year they get married, and settle down in a house near Boston. “Kitty was always loyal to Boston, like the true Tennant that she is.”Jewett, Sarah O. Old Friends and New. Gloucestershire: Echo Library, 2010. Print. 56. =Miss Sydney’s Flowers= Miss Sydney, a long-time resident of St. Mary Street learns that the city is planning to build a street connecting her street to Jefferson Street. This street will run right by Miss Sydney’s house, a house that is now in the heart of the city due to the urbanization of the area. Miss Sydney is not pleased with this, for she hates the noise, and has grown accustomed to being alone after the passing of all her friends and family. She is a cold and reserved woman, but is never intentionally rude to anyone. Now that her garden is right alongside this new street, Grant Place, Miss Sydney refuses to tend to it, but instead has John, her coachman, do the gardening. Meanwhile, Mrs. Marley, an elderly candy saleswoman moves her stand from Jefferson Street to Garden Place – right outside Miss Sydney’s house – where there is less wind and more business. Miss Sydney is annoyed by the excessive noise from both the new street, in general, as well as Mrs. Marley’s candy cart right outside her window, however she comes to be very interested in the people. She loves watching everyone out of her window, and is prideful that so many people admire at her garden. “She was glad, now that the street was cut, that someone had more pleasure, if she had not.”Jewett, Sarah O. Old Friends and New. Gloucestershire: Echo Library, 2010. Print. 61. Miss Sydney immediately becomes more kind and charitable, stopping by the cart to buy some molasses candy. John is extremely shocked, as Sydney proceeded to give this candy to some children on the street, an act that she would have never done before Grant Place was built. Miss Sydney knows that her change has gone noticed, and this embarrasses her. On their next meeting, Miss Sydney invites Mrs. Marley into her house to warm up, and proceeds to give her money to pay for her bills, as well as dinner for Marley and her sister. Bessie, a neighborhood girl, goes to visit Miss Sydney, for she pities her loneliness, and has noticed a change in her behavior. This is the beginning of a great friendship between the two, despite such a drastic age difference. Miss Sydney is very comfortable with Bessie, and confides a great deal in her, something she has never done with anyone, let alone a child. Sydney tells Bessie of her loneliness and how her age has affected her, but obvious change for the better has subdued these feelings now that Sydney is a warmer, more charitable person. =Lady Ferry= The narrator is to be left alone, as her parents are headed on a long sea voyage, and she is worried about being sent to school. She is instead put under the care of two of her father’s elderly cousins. The narrator is very upset to leave her mother, but is satisfied when she meets cousin Agnes, with whom she will be staying. The narrator feels very comfortable and safe with Agnes, and Agnes welcomes her as if she were her own child. Agnes mentions Lady Ferry, and elderly woman who resides with her and has no family left. Ferry is gentle, but she is not used to children, and her mind wanders. In their first meeting, Lady Ferry welcomes the narrator, and Ferry's age shows during their conversation. She has traveled the world extensively, and is surprised to hear of some very notable deaths, many of which had occurred many years prior. The narrator speaks with Martha, a young servant, who provides more information about Lady Ferry. It is rumored that Ferry will never die, and no one is quite sure from where she came. The narrator becomes more attached to Agnes’ home, and is saddened to leave. “Although I wished to see my father and mother, I cried as if my heart would break because I had to leave the ferry. The time spent there had been the happiest time of all my life.”Jewett, Sarah O. Old Friends and New. Gloucestershire: Echo Library, 2010. Print. 84. After years of living abroad, the narrator returns to America with her father, and she decides to visit Agnes’ house. She discovers a very old grave – one of Lady Ferry – in the family burial ground, and is reassured by the fact that death is certain. =A Bit of Shore Life= The narrator tells about the previous summer, when she spent her days by the sea, watching the fishermen. She met just one boy who was her age, Georgie. He was very mature for his age – 12 years old – and lived with just his father, Andrew West, for his mother had died. West took the loss very poorly, and has refused to look for another wife. One day, when West, Georgie, and the narrator return from a fishing trip, they find Georgie’s aunt Hannah waiting on the shore, who speaks with West about some clothes that she has been making for them. She accepts a haddock from West, and before she returns home, invites the narrator to visit her. The narrator and Georgie go to visit Hannah, and encounter an auction from a house up for sale. On seeing the large crowd present, the narrator reflects on life in New England. “I wonder if anyone has not often been struck…by the sadness and hopelessness which seems to overshadow many of the people who live on the lonely farms in the outskirts of small New-England villages.”Jewett, Sarah O. Old Friends and New. Gloucestershire: Echo Library, 2010. Print. 92. She pities the solitude of such a rural life, for it seems that everyone is so unhappy out in the country. They finally arrive at Hannah’s house, and meet her younger sister, Miss Cynthia West. Hannah and Cynthia tell the narrator that they wish that Georgie had come to live with them after Georgie's mother died, for the two sisters could have used the help, but it would have been impossible to pry Georgie away from both his father and the sea. The narrator expresses regret of moving out of her childhood home. “I knew where the flowers grow under [the trees], and where the ferns were greenest, and it was as much home to me as my own house.”Jewett, Sarah O. Old Friends and New. Gloucestershire: Echo Library, 2010. Print. 99. The narrator finds comfort in familiarity, and misses the place that she could call home. On the way back from Hannah’s house, Georgie and the narrator pass the house that had been auctioned, which now sits boarded up. Upon reaching the sea, the narrator feels content having returned home. Characters =A Lost Lover= Miss Horatia Dane – A lonely, elderly widow in Longfield, she stays much to herself, clearly affected by the loss of her lover decades ago.

He ends up moving to Boston with Kitty in order to marry her. Alice – Kitty’s aunt in Baltimore, she welcomes Kitty when her husband goes abroad, excited to get some help around the house. =Miss Sydney’s Flowers= Miss Sydney – An elderly, lonely woman, she hates the noise that comes along with living in the city. She is unfriendly and stays to herself, but she is pleased when she sees the joy that her garden brings to everyone. She becomes more charitable and kind, to the surprise of everyone that knows her, most notably to Mrs. Marley and Bessie. Mrs. Marley – An old, frail woman who takes care of her sister Polly, she earns money by selling molasses candy from a street cart. She moves her cart to Grant Place when the weather becomes too cold and windy, and she is one of the main benefactors of Miss Sydney’s charitable behavior. John – Miss Sydney’s coachman, he tends to her garden once Grant Place is constructed, and is shocked by Miss Sydney’s behavioral adjustment in which she becomes kind and charitable. Bessie – A young girl from the neighborhood, she befriends Miss Sydney after noticing how lonely the elderly woman is. She is the first child to whom Miss Sydney opens up, and the two women form a great friendship. =Lady Ferry= Narrator – Left alone by her parents who are traveling, she goes to live with two of her father’s elderly cousins.

Georgie – A 12-year-old fisherman, Georgie works harder than most adults, going out into the sea by himself. He lives with just his father, his mother having died. Hannah – Georgie’s aunt, she welcomes the narrator to join her for dinner in the country, and makes her feel very welcome. Themes Old Friends and New is about finding a home – somewhere you can feel comfortable in society. Each of the short stories deals with a person who is lonely in their current environment. Whether they have no family and friends or whether they just do not feel like they fit in, there is at least one character in each story that finds the proper atmosphere for them that makes them feel comfortable. In Lady Ferry, the narrator expresses content in the way cousin Agnes has been so welcoming. She feels more comfortable at her cousin’s house after just one day than a lifetime in her own home. “I began to feel already the pleasure of being in a real home.”Jewett, Sarah O. Old Friends and New. Gloucestershire: Echo Library, 2010. Print. 75. In some of the short stories, the characters make such small adjustments to their lives to realize that they are already happy and are surrounded by people that can quell their loneliness. In others, however, characters travel thousands of miles to learn what home truly is, and begin a new life where they are surrounded by loved ones and realize that they have just now found a home. Old Friends and New demonstrates the importance of religion to New England society in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Though often only minor components of each story, religion is often mentioned alongside comfort. Religious symbols and practices such as bibles and attending church are often found in those places that characters can call home, and the absence of loneliness comes, in part, to a rediscovering (or discovering) of religion. In Miss Sydney’s Flowers, Miss Sydney realizes that she had been unfriendly for so long, and sees the difference that her charity makes in Mrs. Marley’s life. She realizes the effect she can have on other people, and sees practicing Christian ways (such as charity) improves her own life. “Miss Sydney meant to be better, – not alone for the sake of having friends, not alone to quiet her conscience, but because she knew she had been so far from living a Christian life, and she was bitterly ashamed.”Jewett, Sarah O. Old Friends and New. Gloucestershire: Echo Library, 2010. Print. 64. Once the characters realize that religion is a vital component of their lives, they are more satisfied in the way in which they lead their lives, and they feel more comfortable with who they are. Critical Reception Old Friends and New was released in successive monthly installments in The Atlantic Monthly magazine, beginning in January 1878. The short stories were published individually, and each was greeted by acclaim. Not only did the critics praise the stories, but they admired Jewett’s writing style as well. They extolled the messages she represented throughout the stories. This review from Literary World stresses the themes of Old Friends and New, while complimenting Jewett’s character as well. “She is not only one of the sweetest and most charming of writers, but her pages have [had] all along suggestions helpful towards a kindlier and higher way of living.”\\"Reviews of Old Friends and New, 1879.\\" Sarah Orne Jewett Text Project. Ed. Terry Heller and Linda Heller. Coe College. Web. 13 May 2012. . Some reviews – such as this one from Scribner’s Monthly – focus instead on Jewett’s naturalist writing, in which she describes such simple events and focuses on the setting of the story. “They are so manifestly the results of actual observation that they almost impress us as personal confidences, and make us ashamed of being caught napping.” The light nature of these short stories is only compelling because of Jewett’s style, and would otherwise be viewed as descriptions of mundane occurrences. This lack of content, however, seemed to be the one negative point on which critics focused. The same review from Scribner's Monthly takes issue with Jewett's local color writing, citing its extreme simplicity and, perhaps, dullness. “Their substance is so slight that the reader may be excused if he yields to the temptation to skip.” While this critic disliked Jewett's naturalist style, many others found the simplicity charming. Other Most of the stories in Old Friends and New take place in different areas of New England, likely inspired by the fact that Jewett was born and raised in Maine.\\"(Theodora) Sarah Orne Jewett.\\" Gale Literary Databases. Gale Database, 2003. Web. 13 May 2012. Lady Ferry was the one short story of the seven in this book that was not released to the public before Houghton, Osgood and Company compiled and published these stories. In Miss Sydney’s Flowers, Mrs. Marley had trouble working due to her arthritis. This is likely inspired by Jewett's childhood diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.

The letter's content was presented to King Frederick III of Denmark and Norway, and Lykke confessed it. Few months later, he went into exile. The King initiated a trial in which Lykke was found guilty, and he was sentenced to forfeit honour, life, and estate. As Lykke had escaped and could not be executed, an imitational doll was made for and used in a ceremony where it got its right hand cut off and thereafter was beheaded. Also Lykke's coat of arms was destroyed. His large estates were confiscated by the Crown. = Case of Count Griffenfeld = In 1676, Danish and Norwegian count Peder Schumacher Griffenfeld was accused of and sentenced for lèse majesté and other crimes. Bearing his destroyed coat of arms, Griffenfeld was transported to the place of execution. However, just seconds before the sword was to behead Griffenfeld, an officer acting on behalf of King Christian V of Denmark and Norway shouted \\"Stop, it is pardon!\\", whereafter his sentence was changed to lifetime prison. = Case of Juel = In 1723, Povel Juel was executed at the New Square in Copenhagen after having been sentenced on King Christian V's Danish Law of 1683, articles 6-4-1 and 6-4-2. His alleged contribution to possible occupation of Denmark and Norway was considered an attack on the King rather than on the two countries. = Case of Count Struensee and Count Brandt = Struensee and Brandt being executed Front cover of Rifleringen A famous case of lèse majesté is that of Count Johann Friedrich Struensee and Count Enevold Brandt, who in 1772 were accused of and sentenced for this and several other crimes, whereafter they were executed by beheading and placed on the breaking wheel. = Case of Heiberg = In 1799, the Danish Chancery initiated a process against Dano-Norwegian man Peter Andreas Heiberg,Lexow, Carl: P.A. Heiberg : Borger av menneskeligheten 2010, Novus forlag. whom they accused of lèse majesté and whom Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark and Norway—the real initiator of the process—considered a troublesome political opponent. The Crown Prince wrote in a letter of 24 July that he considered Heiberg's magazine \\"exceedingly shameless\\". In a letter of 21 August, the Crown Prince wrote in general that \\"no mercy\\" was to be shown and that \\"fear has to be chased into these humans\\". He suggested that the Chancery initiate a trial and subsequently execute them. However, the Chancery considered that popular opinion in Denmark and Norway made an execution of Heiberg too dangerous. Instead, he was banished from the Kingdoms. Heiberg settled in Paris, where he lived until his death in 1841. = Case of Lysne = In 1803, having led a group of Lærdal farmers who claimed to be exempt from compulsory military service, farmer Anders Lysne was executed by beheading.Krefting, Nøding and Ringvei 2014. Page 52. Refusing to obey the King's commands was considered treason against the country: in an absolute monarchy, this was in practise equal to treason against the King himself, i.e. lèse majesté. = Case of Hielm = Det norske Nationalblad (1815–1822; English: The Norwegian National Magazine) was an oppositional magazine in Oslo. Through its publishers, the magazine was involved in a case of lèse majesté, after which it lost its postage reduction, forcing it to shut down. In 1825, one of the said publishers, Jonas Anton Hielm, was sentenced to pay a fine of 500 speciedaler. = Case of Løberg = In 1878, Member of Parliament Hjalmar Løberg was sentenced for lèse majesté because of an article, published in the magazine Hardangeren, where he claimed that King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway had political motivations for giving a medal to a specific member of parliament. = Case of Hol = In 1884, Jon Gundersen Hol was arrested, accused of lèse majesté in his pamphlet Rifleringen (English: The Ring of Rifles). The pamphlet, published on 6 February, called upon semi-military personnel and other civilians possessing weapons to encircle and protect the Parliament in the case a coup d'état, thereby indirectly accusing King Oscar II of having such plans. On 8 February, samples of the pamphlet were confiscated by the police, and at the same time, the printer Nikolai Olsen was arrested. The apprehension of Jon Hol followed on 10 February. He remained in custody until 26 February, and on 11 May, he was charged for lèse majesté. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Lars Holst faced the same charge. However, proceedings were stayed after the fall of the conservative government of Christian Selmer. = 1981 case = In 1981, a protesting punk was charged with lèse majesté for throwing a tomato at, but failing to hit Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, who was in Oslo on her second state visit to Norway.Aftenposten (6 May 1981): Dronningen var målet [...] (English: The Queen was the Target [...])Aftenposten (7 May 1981): Punker siktet for majestetsforbrytelse (English: Punker Charged for Lèse Majesté)  See also  * Lèse majesté * Monarchy of Norway  References  Category:Norwegian monarchy Category:Norwegian law Category:Penal system in Norway Category:Crime in Norway ","title":"Lèse majesté in Norway"},{"id":"35812512","text":"Sir Alexander Seton, also known as Alexander de Seton (fl. 1311 – c. 1348) was the Governor (sometimes referred to as the Keeper or the Captain) of Berwick. Life Alexander Seton took part in Edward Bruce's 1315 campaign in Ireland.Seton, Bruce Gordon. The House of Seton, Vol. I, Lindsay and MacLeod, Edinburgh, 1939 He signed the Declaration of Arbroath of 1320 asserting the independence of Scotland. Berwick-upon-Tweed In 1327 he was said to be appointed keeper of Berwick-upon-Tweed. For how long is unclear as on 21 March King Robert applied for a Safe-Conduct for him to go to England for negotiations.Anderson, William, The Scottish Nation, Edinburgh, 1861, vol.8, p.436. In 1331 Sir Robert de Lawedre of The Bass was Keeper of the Scottish Marches and Custodian of the Castle of Berwick-upon-Tweed, receiving a fee attributed to those positions, at Pentecost, of £33.6s.8p. He is also described as Sheriff of Berwick, for which he received a further payment.Exchequer Rolls of Scotland, vol.1, 1264-1359, Edinburgh, 1878, pps: 279,313,339 & 399. He was still holding those positions the following year as mentioned by the historian of the town.Berwick-upon-Tweed, the History of the Town and Guild, by John Scott, London, 1888, pps.248-9. In March 1333 Edward Balliol, son and heir of King John Balliol, and Henry Beaumont, 4th Earl of Buchan, along with their supporters and those of the late John Comyn invaded Scotland with the tacit support of Edward III of England. The army advanced quickly towards Berwick, which was placed under siege. In 1333 Alexander Seton was again governor of the town of Berwick,Anderson, 1861, p.436. while Patrick de Dunbar, Earl of March was entrusted with the defence of the castle. After a long siege, an agreement to surrender Berwick within a certain time unless it has been relieved was obtained. Alexander's son, Thomas Seton, was given as a hostage. A small party of Scots led by Sir William Keith managed with some difficulty to make their way across the charred ruins of the old bridge to the northern bank of the Tweed and were able to force their way through to the walled town, which sat below the castle. Guardian of the Realm Archibald Douglas, who had crossed the Border into England in order to draw Edward, viewed this as a technical relief and sent messages to Edward calling on him to depart. King Edward III of England viewed it differently, and as the town had not surrendered by the agreed date, saw this as a breach of the agreement and hanged Thomas Seton within sight of the besieged and his parents. Another treaty was agreed to so as to protect the other hostages. Berwick was eventually surrendered after the defeat of the Scots at the Battle of Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333. In this month, in a double tragedy, Seton's son William drowned in an attack upon the English fleet at Berwick, again in sight of his father. Alexander was present in Edward Balliol's parliament on 10 February 1334 and witnessed the (temporary) cession of Berwick to the English. He had a Safe-conduct to go to England, 15 October 1337, and in August 1340 he was one of the hostages for John, Earl of Moray. He entered the Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, after 1341 and was styled Master of Torphichen in 1345 after being appointed to the charge of the Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem House of Torphichen by the Hélion de Villeneuve, Grand Master at Rhodes. Alexander obtained an temporary dispensation granted on 6 February 1346-47 by Pope Clement VI, permitting Alexander to choose a confessor. As a Knight of the Order he was granted safe- conduct dated 12 August 1348 to enable him to visit King David II of Scotland, who was imprisoned within the Tower of London. Alexander seems to have died shortly afterwards. Marriage and issue He married Christian, daughter of Francis le Cheyne of Straloch; they had issue: * Thomas, executed outside Berwick in 1333 during the siege. * William, drowned July 1333 in an attack upon the English fleet at Berwick, during the siege. * Margaret, the heiress, married Alan de Wyntoun, and had issue. Their children took the surname of Seton. * Alexander, killed opposing the landing of Edward Balliol at Kinghorn, 6 August 1332. * John of Parbroath, died c. 1327.

Biography Juan Tomás de Boxadors began his career as a diplomat of the Kingdom of Spain to the court of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor. Following the death of his brother in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, Boxadors had a spiritual crisis that resulted in his joining the Dominican Order. He taught Christian theology for a number of years, and then became a companion of Master Brémond. At a General Chapter of 1756, the Dominican Order elected him as their master.Benedict M. Ashley, The Dominicans, ch. 7 That chapter charged him with promoting the use of the rosary, and Boxadors did so faithfully. He completed a visitation of the order's Spanish provinces. He promoted the revival of Thomism with his letter \\"De renovanda et defendenda doctrina sancti Thomae\\" (1757) which was widely distributed in the Order. Lamenting deviations from Thomistic doctrine and demanding a return to the teachings of Thomas Aquinas, Boxadors charged Salvatore Roselli (1722–1784) with assisting the reform of education in the order. Roselli then wrote his influential Summa philosophica ad mentem Angelici Doctoris S. Thomae Aquinatis of 1777, which supplanted the major manuals of the day and continued to be the standard Thomistic text through its third edition in 1857–59.https://books.google.com/books?id=9dNHbgYab7QC&pg;=PA75&lpg;=PA75&dq;=Boxadors+%22sopra+Minerva%22&source;=bl&ots;=TpeXm_8hEo&sig;=6RmMqkEJWk3ixQ4XUrZr2NHiMLw&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=ruG5VO3cCoWayATC84KoDw&ved;=0CC4Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q;=Boxadors%20%22sopra%20Minerva%22&f;=false Accessed 16 Jan., 2015, Filosofía cristiana en el pensamiento católico de los siglos XIX y XX/2 ... ed. by Emerich Coreth, Walter M. Neidl, Georg Pfligersdorffer, p. 75 In the wake of the Enlightenment, the Dominican Order was able to recruit fewer and fewer young men and women. By 1758, there were only three novices in all of the Kingdom of France. In 1765, Louis XV of France appointed a commission to reform the religious houses of France. Boxadors futilely resisted these reforms. Pope Pius VI made him a cardinal in 1775.Juan Tomás Cardinal de Boxadors y Sureda de San Martín, O.P. He died in 1780.

The film focuses on gay men who align themselves with hardcore right-wing views, white power skinheads, and Nazis. Rosa von Praunheim stated of the subjects featured in the documentary, “Some may be shocked that I do not take a stand in my film and do not portray gay neo-Nazis as monsters, but as people living their lives in dramatic contradiction.”Porter & Prince, Guide to Gay and Lesbian Film, p. 254 Plot During a gay march in Berlin, some of the men in the crowd are asked their opinion about gay men who have extreme right- wing views or who are white power skinheads or neo-Nazis. All of those questioned express their disapproval. One of them comments the absurdity of the situation: if the gay right-wing and neo-Nazis would have lived in the era they admire, they would have been exterminated. Four gay men in present-day Germany who are, or have been, engaged in right-wing political parties are interviewed: Andre, a skinhead; Bela Ewald Althans, a former prominent neo- Nazi leader; Alexander Schlesinger, who is involved in right wing politics and Jörg Fischer, a right wing theorist. Andre is a skinhead who defines violence as to have the courage to defend himself and as part of the expression of the warrior within. Openly gay, he is tolerated by his fellow skinheads but admits that he is in constant threat. Eventually, he moves away from the skinheads movement to conservative politics. Bela Ewald Althans, who now works in advertising, was in the early 1990s one of Germany most prominent neo-Nazi, an Adolf Hitler admirer and holocaust denier. In 1994, he was arrested and spent 21 months in jail for denying the holocaust in front of astonished tourists during a visit to Dachau concentration camp while he was filmed in Profesion: Neonazi (Beruf Neonazi), a documentary about him. Althans is now involved in the gay community, but he does not regret his past. He tells that he did not become gay from one day to the other, but evolved in his feelings and attractions until he discovered his true self. Alexander Schlesinger, who came from East Germany, is a member of a political party representing extreme right-wing views. Schlesinger claims that being gay does not make a person better, a gay can be racist. About what he finds appealing, he comments: \\"We gay men are drawn toward a masculine ideal. I can't stand a screaming queen\\". For nine years, Jörg Fischer was an active member of the extreme right-wing parties NPD and DVU. During that time he had a relationship with another male party member. Although they had sex many times a week for four years, they never talked about sex or mention the word gay. Fischer left those organizations in 1991 rejecting their anti-immigrant and anti- gay policies. He found a different romantic male partner and now works in social issues. The testimonies of the four men are intertwined with interviews by historians, journalists and intellectuals who have followed the links between fascism and homosexuality through recent German history. The life of famed neo-Nazi Michael Kuhnen is recounted. Considered the Führer by his followers, he kept his homosexuality secret until 1981 when Johannes Bugner, a young gay neo- Nazi, was stabbed to death in Hamburg for his sexual orientation. Kuhnen disengaged himself from the killers, considering Bugner a martyr of the movement and came out as gay in his booklet National Socialism and homosexuality writing that gay men make better fighters, because, having no family, they are closer to their comrades. Kuhnen, ostracized by his former supporters, died of AIDS in 1991. There have always been extreme right-wing homosexuals, the documentary explains, even in Nazi Germany. Rudolf Hess had no interest in women, wrote love letters and poems to men in his youth and married only on Hitler's advise. Ernst Röhm, co-founder of the Sturmabteilung (SA, \\"Storm Battalion\\"), the Nazi Party militia, was a close friend of Hitler since 1919, and was the only one allowed to address Hitler by his first name, Adolph. Hitler knew about Röhm's homosexuality and particular weakness for young soldiers but turned a blind eye as he counted on Röhm's violent trooper paramilitary Brownshirts during his ascending to power. During the purge of the Nazi party known as Night of the Long Knives (1934) Hitler had Röhm arrested and killed shortly after in prison. Edmund Heines, Röhm's deputy in the SA, was another gay Nazi leader. He set-up his own special concentration camp near Breslau so he could torture and kill victims for pleasure. Theories on Adolf Hitler's own sexuality are also briefly examined. Lothar Machtan in his book Hitler's Secret: The double life of a dictator (Hitlers Geheimnis: Das Doppelleben eines Diktators) questions Hitler's sexuality. During the Nazi regime between 5 and 15 thousand gay men were killed in concentration camps. Pierre Seel, a gay Holocaust survivor, appears briefly recounting how a young friend was eaten alive by the dogs of Schirmeck-Vorbruck concentration camp. Home media Men Heroes and Gay Nazis! was released on Region 2 DVD in German with English subtitles as a part of a box set of von Praunheim's films.

Each year, the Finnish Society for Innovation Journalism hands out the Innovation Crystal, a Finnish innovation journalism prize awarded for a particularly well-written innovation-related story published during the previous year in Finland. Academic research In 2009 futurist researchers Inkinen and Kaivo-Oja suggested that the rise of innovation journalism as a key notion and research field revealed that the significant role of journalistic practices had not been taken into consideration in the traditional innovation models.Inkinen and Kaivo-oja UNDERSTANDING INNOVATION DYNAMICS: Aspects of Creative Processes, Foresight Strategies, Innovation Media, and Innovation Ecosystems FFRC eBook 9/2009 Finland Futures Research Centre, Turku School of Economics In 2009, Nordfors published a summary of concept development, academic research and the ongoing innovation journalism initiatives around the world D.

A Review of the Innovation Journalism Initiative 2003-2009 Innovation Journalism Vol.6 No.1. 2009 Kauhanen and Noppari suggested the definition of Innovation Journalism should have a stronger focus on social aspects.Kauhanen and Noppari Kauhanen & Noppari (2007): Innovation, Journalism and Future (Tekes, Technology review 200/2007) In 2005, Uskali proposed that detecting weak signals could be important practice for innovation journalists.Uskali, Turo Paying Attention to Weak Signals - The Key Concept for Innovation Journalism Innovation Journalism Vol.2 No.11. 2005 Innovation Journalism is based on a systemic view, with an inherent focus on connecting different stakeholder groups in the innovation economy in a shared public narrative. This connects Innovation Journalism to a discussion about society by for example Gerber.Gerber Was ist Guter Innovationsjournalismus? Fachjournalist No.2 2012 p.35 The idea of \\"newsbeats\\" as originally set forth by Gaye Tuchman Gaye Tuchman Making News by Doing Work - Routinizing the Unexpected American Journal of Sociology Vol. 79, No. 1 (Jul., 1973), pp. 110-131 and Herbert Gans among others, was understood as an aspect of newsroom socialization, of media economy, of gender, of time and other constraints on resources. But it did contain an idea of news journalism as an aspect of an ecosystem.

No.1. Innovation journalism initiatives The Innovation Journalism Initiative hosted by Stanford University started in 2004 as a collaboration with VINNOVA, resulting in the creation of the VINNOVA-Stanford Research Center of Innovation Journalism in 2009 (renamed in 2010, the Center for Innovation and Communication at Stanford University). The activities included starting up innovation journalism as academic research, an international Innovation Journalism Fellowship program,Eric Eldon Q&A; with David Nordfors on Innovation Journalism VentureBeat March 29, 2008 with participants from several different countries, a yearly global innovation journalism conference. The core 'innovation journalism' concept is to consider two specific facets of journalism: innovations in journalism, e.g. the use of the Internet or other digital media in addition to traditional print, and journalistic treatment of innovation in various disciplines such that the 'vertical' consideration of specific innovations, for example their technological, business, sociological or political influences, could be embraced on a 'horizontal' basis that would more completely explain to audiences the relevance of such advances. Almost all earlier journalism has focused on one or other of the 'vertical' areas of journalism, commonly found in the popular media. Innovation journalism thus makes much broader demands on journalists, in that their narrow specialties cannot adequately capture the full spectrum of influence brought about by innovations themselves. This, in turn, calls for new approaches to journalism education. The purpose of the Stanford initiative was to co-develop the concept and community of innovation journalism, including the role of communication in innovation ecosystems, recognizing journalists and communicators (and other attention workers) as actors facilitating the creation of shared language across stakeholder groups in innovation ecosystems.Mark Glaser Stanford Program Breaks Down Walls Between Business and Tech Journalism PBS Mediashift Dec 10, 2009 There have been national innovation journalism initiatives including Fellowship program in collaboration with Stanford University in Sweden, Finland,SITRA: The Finnish National Innovation Journalism Fellowship Programme Sitra official website Slovenia, Mexico and Pakistan.D.

Summary The book recounts Delisle's year-long trip to Jerusalem with his long-term partner, Nadège, and their two young children. They arrived in August 2008. Delisle lived in Beit Hanina during his stay in the region. Background Before Jerusalem, Delisle had previously written three other graphic novel travelogues. They are, in order of publication: Shenzhen, about his trip to Shenzhen, an economic hub of Southern China; Pyongyang, about his stay in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea; and Burma Chronicles, about his stay in Rangoon, the then-capital of Burma. He went to Shenzhen and Pyongyang for his work in animation, while he went to Burma to accompany his partner, Nadège, as she did her work for MSF. While in Jerusalem, Delisle again worked primarily as a stay-at-home dad, taking care of their two young children while Nadège was working. When it was released in English in April 2012, it was perhaps Delisle's most-anticipated book. Style and themes Delisle uses simple line drawings that are \\"plain and clean and casual without being sloppy\\". And although Jerusalem is Delisle's first book to feature color, Delisle uses it only sparingly, to center attention on certain important objects, including maps, loud noises, or memories. In the book, Delisle frequently encounters aspects of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and depicts arguments from each side without openly divulging where his sympathies lie. Reception Tim Peters of Slant Magazine summed up, \\"As a whole, the book is both enjoyable and instructive; it makes you chuckle and grin, and it makes you feel like a more informed, concerned citizen of the world.\\" Awards * Fauve d'Or : Prix du meilleur album, Angoulême 2012 * Prix Bédéis causa (Albéric-Bourgeois) * Meilleur Album Reportage, Solliès-Ville 2012 * Prix littéraire des lycéens d'Ile-de-France 2013 * Prix Segalen des Lycéens d'Asie 2013 * Independent Publisher Book Awards Results - Graphic Novel 2013 See also *Burma Chronicles *Pyongyang: A Journey in North Korea *Shenzhen References Category:Autobiographical graphic novels Category:Canadian graphic novels Category:Drawn and Quarterly titles Category:2011 graphic novels Category:Comics set in Jerusalem Category:Comics set in Israel Category:Comics set in the 2000s Category:Comics set in the 2010s Category:Comics by Guy Delisle Category:Israeli–Palestinian conflict in popular culture ","title":"Jerusalem (comics)"},{"id":"35812708","text":"Girl Fight is a television film that premiered on Lifetime on October 3, 2011. Inspired by true events, the film revolves around a 16-year-old girl who tries to fit in with a popular group of girls, leading to a brutal beating upon joining the clique. The film was inspired by a 2008 beating in Florida; a video of some of the beating, released by Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, was used heavily by the news media and the story caused nationwide public outrage. Additionally, Anne Heche and James Tupper who play Haley's parents, were a couple in real life until their split in 2018. Plot Haley Macklin (Jodelle Ferland) is an academically advanced high school student. She sees herself as an outsider because she has skipped a grade. Her intelligence and well articulated contributions to class discussions cause her classmates to become jealous. Frustrated that she is left out from a popular group of girls, she posts negative comments about them on a social networking website. Unexpectedly, she befriends Alexa Simons (Tess Atkins), a popular girl in school who is head over heels for Derek (Rady Panov). Haley offers to help Alexa with her schoolwork. Haley soon breaks the social barrier between her and the popular girls and is accepted by most of them. The girls with whom she does not make a connection are slightly suspicious of her. Haley's behavior changes drastically. She disobeys her parents and is rude to her sister. Her mother, Melissa (Anne Heche) endeavors to make allowances for Haley's attitude and is more lenient than her father, Ray (James Tupper). One day, the popular girls discover the harsh comments that Haley posted online and they feel betrayed. The girls decide to physically attack Haley, while videotaping it. They also plan to post the images online. Clueless about this revenge plot, Haley is invited over to Alexa's house. The girls are waiting by the door and once Haley steps inside, the girls taunt her, calling her names and savagely beat her, until she falls unconscious, suffering a concussion, a ruptured eardrum, and a damaged left eye in the process. The entire beating, which was recorded on video, lasted one hour (condensed in the film). After the brutal attack, Haley wakes up bruised, bloody, confused, and helpless in front of the girls who continue to taunt her. They then abandon her in a parking lot with a cell phone. However, within a few seconds after the girls flee, good Samaritans come to Haley's aid. When Melissa and Ray discover what the girls had done to Haley, Melissa confronts Alexa and her two friends that took part in the beating, Kristin and Taylor, only to be deterred from seeing the footage after the girls make false statements and refuse to give in. Drawing suspicion from Alexa's grandmother, Marylou (Linda Darlow), she attempts to retrieve Taylor's phone to see the footage herself, but Kristin and Taylor hastily escape the house via Alexa's open sliding door. Marylou then tries to get Taylor's phone number from Alexa's contacts list, but is left shocked and disappointed when she sees a video frame of Haley's bloodied and bruised face on Alexa's computer screen. Haley's parents receive the footage of the brutal beating, now stored in a USB flash drive, from Marylou. After viewing it, Melissa and Ray decide to take serious action against the girls, by alerting authorities. Infuriated that Marylou had given Haley's parents the footage, Alexa flees and goes to Kristin's house. However, her house is traced by police, who arrive and arrest them, along with Taylor and the two other girls that took part in the beating, Becca and Lauren, and are charged with kidnapping and battery, and are later released on bail. Alexa, who had conspired in the beating, is regarded by the media and police as the ringleader. At high school, students cheer the girls for what they did. However, Becca, disturbed after watching the video herself, regrets what she did and turns her back against the girls. While the kids at school think the girls are \\"cool\\", people from around the country have seen the video, causing nationwide public outrage. While using a restroom, Haley is confronted and reprimanded by a visibly enraged Alexa, but the feud is broken up by Melissa, who is then confronted by Marylou, claiming that Alexa and her friends are each facing a life sentence. Haley thinks that those punishments should be reduced. Although her mother agrees to recommend this, they disagree on the plea bargain the girls' lawyers had arranged, knowing that lighter sentences are the appropriate punishment for the girls. The girls responsible for the attack are tried and eventually convicted: Alexa receives three years' probation, 100 hours of community service, and an order to pay Haley $1,700 in restitution, Kristin receives 15 days' imprisonment and is placed on three years' probation, Becca, Taylor, and Lauren each get one year's probation, with Lauren also being ordered to pay Haley an additional $2,000 in restitution. In addition to the above sentencing, all five of the girls are restricted from any social network sites for the full term of their probation. The film ends with Haley and Melissa, now feeling more relaxed with the girls' convictions, walking out of the courthouse and in front of the press who are about to interview them.

Design and development After initial operations using the DFS 230, it became obvious to the Wehrmacht that a larger more capable assault glider would be desirable. The DFS 230 F was designed to fulfil that need, but in an atmosphere of political intransigence. The RLM (Reichsluftfahrtministerium - German Air Ministry), issued a directive in 1941 that no effort was to be spent designing a replacement for the rather dated DFS 230 assault glider, in its weight class. Ing. Hünerjäger of Gothaer Waggonfabrik (Gotha) believed that a great improvement on the DFS 230 could be achieved with an aircraft of similar dimensions designing what was named the DFS 230 V7 despite the ban. Gotha named their new design's prototype DFS 230 V7, production aircraft were to be designated DFS 230F-1, to deflect criticism for ignoring the ban on DFS 230 replacement. Generally similar in layout and construction to the DFS 230A, the DFS 230F was a larger machine capable of carrying almost double the weight of cargo of the base-line DFS 230A-1, as well as seating up to 15 troops, as opposed to seven. Construction of the DFS 230F was of welded-steel tube for the fuselage with wooden wings, control and tail surfaces, all fabric or plywood skinned. The fuselage was provided with side doors and a removable roof panel to allow loading of bulky items. Control of the aircraft was by conventional elevator, ailerons, with large landing flaps to reduce landing speed and spoilers to adjust the approach angle. The undercarriage consisted of two main-wheels attached to the fuselage sides and a tail-skid. Completed in 1943 the DFS 230 V7 had a cargo hold measuring x x , a vast improvement on the DFS 230. Access to the hold was via large hatches in the fuselage sides and roof of the rear fuselage. For assault glider missions a crew of two would fly the aircraft with up to 11 Fallschirmjäger or up to of cargo in overload conditions. Despite successful flight trials no orders for production aircraft were forthcoming and only the prototype was built.

Media coverage of the Gulf War was significant for many reasons including CNN's live reporting from a Baghdad hotel, alternative and international coverage, and the use of images. U.S. television coverage and the CNN factor The Persian Gulf War was a heavily televised war. New technologies, such as satellite technology, allowed for a new type of war coverage.Moore, Frazier. \\"New Tools Showed Gulf War on TV\\". The media also had access to military innovations, such as the imagery obtained from \\"camera-equipped high-tech weaponry directed against Iraqi targets\\", according to the Museum of Broadcast Communications. For the first time, people all over the world were able to watch live pictures of missiles hitting their targets and fighters taking off from aircraft carriers from the actual perspective of the machinery. The images of precise land bombing and use of night vision equipment gave the reporting a futuristic spin which was said to resemble video game imagery and encourage the \\"war drama\\". Because of the pool system, however, most television networks relied heavily on the information and imagery supplied by the military.\\"Television: The Persian Gulf War\\". Encyclopedia of the New American Nation This limited the media’s ability to cover the war, despite those new technologies that created the potential for live coverage. The war was covered live since its beginnings by the three main American networks, as well as the emerging CNN. On the night of January 16, when the air strikes began, ABC's Peter Jennings, CBS's Dan Rather, and NBC's Tom Brokaw were anchoring their evening newscasts. ABC News correspondent Gary Shepard, reporting live from Baghdad, told Jennings of the quietness of the city. But, moments later, Shepard was back on the air as flashes of light were seen on the horizon and tracer fire was heard on the ground. On CBS, viewers were watching a report from correspondent Allen Pizzey, who was also reporting from Baghdad, when the war began. On the \\"NBC Nightly News\\", correspondent Mike Boettcher reported unusual air activity in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Moments later, Brokaw announced to his viewers that the air attack had begun. However, it was CNN which gained the most popularity for their coverage, and indeed its wartime coverage is often cited as one of the landmark events in the development of the network. CNN was the only 24‑hour coverage news network and by the time the war began they had already been doing this type of coverage for 10 years.Smith, Perry M. How CNN Fought the War. New York, NY: Birch Lane Press, 1991. When the war broke out they already possessed the necessary equipment and personnel and were ready to follow events in Baghdad on a 24‑hour basis. \\"They had the reporters, satellite, linkups, the engineers, the producers and expert commentators in place or on standby\\". In addition when the government warned American journalists that their security might be put at risk because of the bombings, CNN’s Baghdad correspondents Bernard Shaw, John Holliman, and Peter Arnett, as well as the rest of their team chose to stay behind. Furthermore, when the Iraqi authorities decided to expel the rest of the Western correspondents CNN’s team was able to stay behind because producer Robert Winner had spent the last months trying to build cooperative relations with government officials in Baghdad. During the first days of the bombing the CNN team was able to report live via radio from their hotel suite in the Rashid Hotel, while no other network was able to do this. The CNN live coverage from the hotel was also significant since it was unedited. This event was a critical turn to the 24-hour news coverage. Out of the CNN correspondents the one who received the most attention was Peter Arnett who became known for the controversy of his reportages. His reports on the Coalition’s POWs, on the bombing of what was claimed to be a milk factory by the Iraq authorities, and on the bombing of the bunker outside Bagdad where nearly 400 civilians were killed, were particularly controversial and resulted in him being tilted as anti-patriotic by some. right Overall media and television reporting during this first Gulf War has received several criticisms. People like Columbia’s professor Douglas Kellner have argued that the media framed the war as an exciting narrative, turning it into a kind of dramatic, patriotic spectacle and that the anchors of the major American TV networks such as CBS presented a view that seemed to identify solely with the American Military point of view.Kellner, Douglas. \\"The Persian Gulf TV War Revisited\\". In the book The Persian Gulf TV War he has also argued that television networks and other media did not provide a balanced account of the events because this did not further the business interests of commercial networks.Kellner, Douglas. The Persian Gulf TV War. Westview Press, 1992. General Norman Schwarzkopf referred to the driver of a vehicle in a famous news conference during Gulf War on January 30, 1991 as \\"The luckiest man in Iraq\\". He showed a video of a laser-guided bomb destroying a bridge just after the vehicle had driven over it. International coverage In Britain, the BBC devoted the FM portion of its national speech radio station BBC Radio 4 to an 18-hour rolling news format creating Radio 4 News FM. The station was short lived, ending shortly after President Bush declared the ceasefire and the liberation of Kuwait. However, it paved the way for the later introduction of Radio Five Live. Two BBC journalists, John Simpson and Bob Simpson (who, despite sharing a surname, are unrelated), defied their editors and remained in Baghdad to report on the progress of the war. They were responsible for a report which included an \\"infamous cruise missile that travelled down a street and turned left at a traffic light.\\" Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom addressed the nation on February 24 1991, on the war having consulted with Prime Minister John Major and government ministers. This was the first time the Queen had spoken in a televised address in addition to her annual Christmas message. Newspapers all over the world also covered the war and Time magazine published a special issue dated 28 January 1991, the headline \\"WAR IN THE GULF\\" emblazoned on the cover over a picture of Baghdad taken as the war began. U.S. policy regarding media freedom was much more restrictive than in the Vietnam War. The policy had been spelled out in a Pentagon document entitled Annex Foxtrot. Most of the press information came from briefings organized by the military. Only selected journalists were allowed to visit the front lines or conduct interviews with soldiers. Those visits were always conducted in the presence of officers, and were subject to both prior approval by the military and censorship afterward. This was ostensibly to protect sensitive information from being revealed to Iraq. This policy was heavily influenced by the military's experience with the Vietnam War, in which public opposition within the United States grew throughout the course of the war. It wasn't only the limiting of information in the Middle East, media were also restricting what was shown about the war with more graphic depictions like Ken Jarecke's image of a burnt Iraqi soldier being pulled from the American AP wire whereas in Europe it was given extensive coverage. At the same time, the coverage of this war was new in its instantaneousness. About halfway through the war, Iraq's government decided to allow live satellite transmissions from the country by Western news organizations, and U.S. journalists returned en masse to Baghdad. Tom Aspell of NBC, Bill Blakemore of ABC, and Betsy Aaron of CBS News filed reports, subject to acknowledged Iraqi censorship. Throughout the war, footage of incoming missiles was broadcast almost immediately. A British crew from CBS News (David Green and Andy Thompson), equipped with satellite transmission equipment traveled with the front line forces and, having transmitted live TV pictures of the fighting en route, arrived the day before the forces in Kuwait City, broadcasting live television from the city and covering the entrance of the Arab forces the following day. =Middle East media and audiences= Arab media industry was strictly controlled by governments. State-owned TV stations were also being supervised. As the mouthpiece of the authority, Ab news media only broadcast what the government wanted the public to know. News in this context is called \\"protocol news\\", reporting war information closely following the government agenda.1 Witnessing the significant influence of CNN’s Gulf War coverage, Arab states realized how satellite television reporting could grant a country considerable leverage during war times. Witnessing the dramatic impact of CNN's international coverage of the 1991 Gulf War, several Arab states realized the strategic value of satellite television during times of conflict. Many of the Gulf States began launching their own national satellite TV networks. Arab governments saw satellite news as the ideal vehicle for extending and exerting influence beyond their own borders. The success of CNN among Arab audiences during the Gulf War led to the establishment of the Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC) in London. Events such as the Gulf war and the 2003 invasion of Iraq created major realignments in Saudi social and political boundaries. Alternative media coverage Alternative media outlets provided views in opposition to the Gulf War. Deep Dish Television in collaboration with Paper Tiger Television its sister organization, compiled segments from independent producers in the U.S. and abroad, and produced a ten-hour series that was distributed internationally, called The Gulf Crisis TV Project. The first program of this series War, Oil and Power was compiled and released in 1990, before the war broke out. News World Order was the title of another program in the series; it focused on the complicity of the media in promoting the war, as well as Americans' reactions to the media coverage. In San Francisco, as a local example, Paper Tiger Television West produced a weekly cable television show with highlights of mass demonstrations, artists' actions, lectures, and protests against mainstream media coverage at newspaper offices and television stations. Local media outlets in cities across the country screened similar oppositional media. The organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) critically analyzed media coverage during the Gulf War in various articles and books, such as the 1991 Gulf War Coverage: The Worst Censorship was at Home. Government communication Although a short war, communication from the administration during the Gulf War was significant. Learning lessons from the television coverage of the Vietnam War, the Pentagon strategically communicated the Gulf War to the American public by placing certain restrictions on press coverage.War and Television Select journalists were allowed to visit the front lines in \\"press pools.\\" These reporters had to be accompanied by U.S. military.Picture PowerAfter the war The military's communication policy regarding Operation Desert Storm were disclosed in a 10-page document entitled the Annex Foxtrot, drafted by Captain Ron Wildermuth, the chief aide for public affairs. This was the first conflict in which reporters had to be escorted by military officials called the Department of Defense National Media Pool. Officials claimed national security and classifying information from the enemy as reason for these new policies. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was primarily responsible for the oversight of these press restrictions, and modeled the restrictions after the press blackout during the invasion of Panama in 1989. The Pentagon televised daily briefings primarily conducted by Lieutenant General Thomas Kelley. White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said the only time information was withheld was when it threatened national security. The press did attempt to fight back to the administration's access policies during the Gulf War. Bureau chiefs from print and television collaborated on a letter to President Bush communicating concerns about the restrictions in Saudi Arabia particularly.Second front Ted Koppel, host of ABC's \\"Nightline\\" criticized the administration's policies stating, \\"I'm not sure the public's interest is served by seeing what seems to have been such a painless war, when 50,000 to 100,000 people may have died on the other side.\\" References  Further reading    * Category:Gulf War Gulf war Category:Articles containing video clips Category:War and the media ","title":"Media coverage of the Gulf War"},{"id":"35812928","text":"The Cambrian Muav Limestone is the upper geologic unit of the 3-member Tonto Group.

The Muav is in part younger than, and in-part grades into, the Bright Angel Shale, which is less erosion resistant and is categorized as a slope-forming unit. The Muav is about 350 feet thick in the east and reaches about 600 feet thick in the western part of its exposure area in the Grand Canyon. The two units lie above the erosion-resistant cliff-forming Tapeats Sandstone. In the eastern canyon, the Tapeats Sandstone creates the extremely horizontal Tonto Platform. In west Grand Canyon, the north-south Toroweap Fault is the west perimeter of the Tonto Platform, and west Grand Canyon is dominated by the erosion resistant unit of the Esplanade Sandstone. The Tonto Trail is a mostly horizontal trail on the south side of Granite Gorge, on the Tonto Platform. Muav Limestone cliff example, below Redwall Limestone cliff, on the North Kaibab Trail (closeup photos, often show purple erosion debris) (expandable photo) The Tonto Group units were deposited on an ancient erosion surface (angular unconformity) on the Vishnu Basement Rocks. The Vishnu sequence has a dip of about 45 degrees. As this long-timeframe unconformity represents about 1,000 million years (1.0 billion years) of non–deposition, tectonic activity and erosion, on the Vishnu Basement Rocks, is called the Great Unconformity. Beyond the Grand Canyon area the Muav occurs in southern Utah, southern Nevada and southern California. In the California occurrence it is known as the Muav Marble.

Suzy Homemaker was a line of miniature functional toy household appliances produced by Topper Toys and launched in 1966. Topper Toys created a line of accessory toys to be bought separately, which included items such as a small working oven, a vacuum cleaner, and several other items in addition to a Suzy Homemaker doll introduced later. The term \\"Suzy Homemaker\\" has since become a common phrase in American English. Doll and accessories Topper Toys introduced the Suzy Homemaker toys in 1966 when the toy market was becoming more diversified by modern manufacturing and marketing. Suzy Homemaker toys became popular, ultimately reaching iconic status in the United States. The doll and toys typified the American suburban housewife and her regular chores, representing a domestic ideal to girls in an era when most women were still homemakers after marriage. The accessory line by Topper Toys consisted of toy appliances that functioned using batteries or electrical plugs for power. The accessories included: a Budget Blender, Deluxe Grill, Dishwasher-Sink, Hair Dryer, High Speed Mixer, Ice Cream Maker, Ice Delight Maker, Jet Spray Iron, Juicer, Popcorn Popper, Refrigerator, Super Oven, Soda Fountain, Taffy Puller, and Washing Machine. Suzy Homemaker products were marketed to girls ages 4 to 12. The Suzy Homemaker doll became the second-most popular doll in the United States after the Barbie doll. One of Suzy Homemaker's competitors was the Easy-Bake Oven line of products. Current products Suzy Homemaker products are today being produced and sold as nostalgia items. There are products for adults based on Suzy Homemaker, but given some contemporary humor. The trademark for Suzy Homemaker is owned by J. Lloyd International, Inc. Cultural impact The toy appliances and doll became much desired toys among girls from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s. As this generation grew up, \\"Suzy Homemaker\\" eventually became an insult directed at women judged as excessively domestic. It was used in this context by feminists initially, to imply that a woman was reactionary and overly conservative in her habits. In this sense, the \\"Suzy Homemaker\\" term meant any woman who embodied conventional social expectations without questioning them. In 1981, Newsweek magazine ran an article on the Future Homemakers of America titled \\"So long, Suzy Homemaker\\". Social conservatives have been critical of what they see as a derogatory stereotype. Suzy Homemaker is included in Webster's Dictionary.

About 114,000 indigenous people live in the country, comprising 2.4% of the total population. Indigenous Costa Ricans strive to keep their cultural traditions and language alive. In 1977, the government passed the Indigenous Law, which created reserves. There are a total of 24 indigenous territories located throughout Costa Rica. After only gaining the right to vote in 1994, they are still fighting for their rights, particularly regarding the government taking over their land and ignoring the articles which protect them. While indigenous people have struggle for legal recognition of their rights, Costa Rica did sign the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007. Indigenous Costa Ricans belong to eight major ethnic groups. History Pre-Columbian harpy eagle gold pendant, Museo del Oro Precolombino The first indigenous peoples of present day Costa Rica were hunters and gatherers, and the territory was divided in two cultural areas due to its geographical location in the Intermediate Area, between the Mesoamerican and the Andean cultural regions. Its indigenous peoples have lived in Costa Rica for what stretches back to at least 10,000 years before the arrival of the Spaniards. The northwest of the country, the Nicoya Peninsula, was the southernmost point of Mesoamerican cultural influence when the Spanish conquerors came in the sixteenth century. The Nicoya culture was the largest cacicazgo on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica.Greater Nicoya Culture - Precolumbian culture of Costa Rica and Nicaragua Nicoya The central and southern portions of the country belonged to the Isthmo-Colombian cultural area with strong Muisca influences, as they were part of territories occupied predominantly by speakers of the Chibchan languages. The Diquis culture flourished from 700 CE to 1530 CE. Christopher Columbus arrived in Costa Rica in 1502 on his last trip to the Americas. Costa Rica received its name from Gil Gonzalez Dávila when he arrived and thought he found the most gold he had ever seen; therefore naming it the \\"Rich Coast\\". To the Spaniards, it was less organized from other indigenous groups they had discovered, mainly because they lived in separate groups rather than one large group. During the colonization, Costa Rica was very poor, mainly because it was isolated from the majority of colonies of the Spanish Empire. The initial colonies that were set up were unsuccessful because of disease, as well as the weather of the tropical rain forests. Costa Rica did not become a province of Spain until the 1560s, when a community was created that used the volcanic soil for agricultural purposes. By the time that Columbus arrived, there were about 20,000 Costa Rican natives, but this number greatly declined. That was primarily due to disease, particularly smallpox as well as the fact that many indigenous people were enslaved to work and oftentimes escaped from them. Groups The Boruca are known for their traditional masks = Boruca, southern Costa Rica = About 2,660 people are in the Boruca tribe. They live in the Puntarenas area of Costa Rica on one of the first reservations that was established for indigenous Costa Ricans. They are popular for their crafts, particularly masks made for the \\"Fiesta de los Diablos\\" which is a three-day festival that stages fights between the Boruca Indians (depicted as devils) and the Spanish conquistadors (portrayed as Bulls). = Bribri, southern Atlantic coast = The Bribri are an indigenous tribe that lives in Salitre, Cabagra, Talamanca Bribri and Kekoldi; Cabécar in Alto Chirripó, Tayni, Talamanca Cabécar, Telire and China Kichá, Bajo Chirripó, Nairi Awari and Ujarrás. They are a voting majority in the Puerto Viejo de Talamanca area. The range of the population stretches from 11,000 to 35,000. The Bribri have a specific social structure that is organized in clans. Each clan is composed of an extended family. Women have a higher status in this society, because their children's clans are determined by whichever clan they come from. Women in the Bribri society are the only ones that can inherit land and prepare the sacred cacao drink used during the rituals. Men's roles are defined by their clan, and often are exclusive for men. The spiritual leader, or \\"awa\\" is very important to the Bribis, which men may have the opportunity to become. Just as it is important to many other indigenous groups in Costa Rica, Cacao holds a particular significance for the Bribi. They believe that the cacao tree used to be a woman and the god Sibú turned her into a tree. Only women may prepare the drink, there are many associations that produce hand made chocolate which help these women. = Cabécar, Cordillera de Talamanca = Cabécar traditional house The Cabécar are the largest Indigenous group in Costa Rica and are considered to be the most isolated. They have been pushed up to the Chirripo Mountains, which requires a few hours long hike to reach. Therefore, the Cabécar have not been exposed to many basic items, and few of them have been exposed to education. They are very traditional and have preserved their culture. They speak mostly their own language rather than Spanish. = Guaymí, southern Costa Rica, along the Panamá border = The Guaymís, also known as the Ngabe are the group of the most people in Costa Rica. They emigrated from Panama to Costa Rica in the 1960s. Their main source of income is based on agriculture where they grow bananas, rice, corn, beans and more. The majority of them live in poverty because they live in secluded areas. = Huetar, Quitirrisí = The Quitirrisi are located in Ciudad Colon and Puriscal in the Central Valley. They are known for handwoven baskets and straw hats. = Maleku, northern Alajuela = The Maleku are an indigenous group of about 600 people located in the San Rafael de Guatuso Indigenous Reserve. Before the Spanish colonization, their territory extended as far west as Rincon de la Vieja, and included the volcano Arenal to the south and Rio Celeste as sacred sites. Today their reserve is located about an hour north of La Fortuna. Although their land was much larger prior to colonization, they are now working on buying their own land back from the government. Their economy is based on indigenous art and many tourists are welcome to watch them perform musical pieces in nearby La Fortuna. This reservation is in great danger and the Maleku no longer live in their traditional houses as the trees are also endangered. They are working hard to protect their language, as there are only about 300 speakers of it. = Matambú, Chorotega = The Matambú, also known as the Chorotega are located in Guanacaste. The Chorotegas translates to \\"The Fleeing People\\", as they fled to Costa Rica in AD 500 to escape slavery in Southern Mexico. particularly being related to Maya people. Parts of their Mexican culture is evident in regards to their language and rituals, including human sacrifices. They are known as being the most powerful group of peoples during the conquest of the Spanish, as they were an organized military group and fought against the Spanish. There is evidence that they were a democracy and elected Caciques, or priests to be the leaders, and also that they were a hierarchical group. They are known for their agriculture, producing primarily corn and their ceramics/pottery today. = Térraba or Teribe, also called Naso, southern Costa Rica = There are about 3,305 Térraba people. As of 2007, the regional poverty rate was 19.3% while for the whole country it was about 3.3%. It is so high, because their forest land has been cleared over the years, which was used for their agriculture and predominant economy. They have not preserved their language as much, as mainly only the elders speak it, but another, larger group of Teribe in Panama do use the language and the two groups are in contact. although a larger group from the tribe living in Panama does use the language and there are visits between the two groups. Talamanca, Limón Province. Re-enactment of the Spanish arrival and indigenous resistance. Current issues =Education= There is a conflict that is over indigenous teachers and students are not receiving the same opportunities as the non indigenous peoples. There were two cases in Boruca and Teribe in which qualified indigenous teachers were not given jobs in the local schools. There is also the fact that the schools which the indigenous attend are not funded properly, and the students aren't given the same resources to learn. As for the universities, the indigenous are fighting to gain qualifications so that they can earn higher paying jobs. =Land issues= Of Costa Rica's 50,900 km2 area of land, 3,344 or 5.9% of the land is labeled as indigenous territories. The major issues facing the indigenous groups of Costa Rica today mainly relate to land. The farmers and ranchers are not in charge of their own land that they work because they are considered to be on a reserve, or their land is in danger due to mining and oil work being done. Indigenous peoples oppose the current El Diquís Hydroelectric Project that will flood some of the lands and affect many of the other groups. It will affect seven of the indigenous territories, including Bribi, Cabecar, Teribe and Brunka). This will be the largest hydro-electric dam in Central America and will cut through nearly 200 historical sites and sacred grounds. =Healthcare= Indigenous peoples of Costa Rica often do not receive adequate healthcare services due to lack of access: they are situated in difficult terrain, particularly in the mountains. Only about 26% of the Indigenous population have access to clean water. Therefore, the Indigenous peoples tend to rely on traditional medicinal practices. Groups like CONAI (National Commission for Indigenous Affairs), working to improve socioeconomic situations of the Indigenous peoples, have tried to integrate the two unsuccessfully as it resulted in bias and little acknowledgment of the Indigenous traditional ways. Some areas have built clinics, but doctors are available only two days of the week.

Formerly used as the U.S. headquarters of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Intelsat), it is known for its futuristic, high-tech architecture.  Background  In the early 1960s, a rapid development of telecommunications satellite technology led to discussion about the need for an international consortium to own and operate telecommunication satellites as a transnational resource. By 1961, the United Nations had adopted a resolution for the peaceful use of outer space that expressed the belief that \\"communication by means of satellites should be available to the nations of the world as soon as practicable on a global and non-discriminatory basis.\\"United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1721 (XVI), International co-operation in the peaceful uses of outerspace, Dec. 20, 1961. The Communication Satellite Act was signed into law the following year in the United States by President Kennedy. It established the privately-owned Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT), headquartered in Washington, DC. COMSAT eventually led to the establishment of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) in 1964. INTELSAT’s main goal was to ensure that satellite communications capabilities were equally available to all countries, which followed and supported the objectives set out by the Communications Satellite Act. Within 10 years of its operations, membership of INTELSAT grew to include 86 countries (including the US), and by 2001, about 150 countries were members.Encyclopedia Brittanica, available at http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289831/Intelsat (accessed October 2013). In 1965, COMSAT and INTELSAT launched Intelsat 1, the first commercial communications satellite to be placed in geosynchronous orbit. Intelsat 1 (nicknamed “Early Bird”) was “parked” 22, 300 miles above Earth’s surface. Geosynchronous orbit allows it so that satellites can remain somewhat stationary over a large portion of Earth. From there, it acted as a relay station for signals from Earth and broadcast them out to anywhere that is in view of the satellite. Early Bird was the first, but not the last, satellite to be launched from INTELSAT, and eventually, complete global coverage was established. Within 10 years, INTELSAT was carrying 5,000 international telephone circuits and had capacity for 20,000 voice circuits and five television channels.Ellen D. Holt, “INTELSAT: Meeting the Needs of the Developing World,” COMSAT Magazine, No. 10, 1982. During the 1980s, development of a new headquarters for INTELSAT began. It was also during the 80s when the federal government pushed forward a proposal to allow competition for international satellite communications. This was approved by the Federal Communication Commission in 1985 and from there, private rivals began to multiply. INTELSAT’s role as an international organization became less significant and eventually it was converted into a private company. It became Intelsat, S.A. and continues to operate today.National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form. Retrieved from https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/o2rpwx9bjj6ruj5/Intelsat%20HQ_3400%20International%20Drive%2C%20NW_DC_Nomination.pdf?dl=0 The INTELSAT organization began looking at options for a new headquarters in 1977. Up until this point, they were leasing a cramped space at L’Enfant Plaza. For this new building, INTELSAT decided to organize an international design competition. The competition took place in 1979 with nearly 100 firms from 23 countries competing for the contract to design the complex. The specifications laid out by INTELSAT for their new headquarters included two important requirements: (1) at least 70% of the office space needed to have natural light and a view and (2) energy efficiency was a must.Peter Buchanan, “Intelsat Interlock” in Architectural Review, Vol. 180, No. 10, October 1986, 104. Structure John Andrews won the 1980 International Union of Architects international competition to design the complex. The competition had taken place in 1979 with nearly 100 firms from 23 countries competing for the contract to design the complex. Ground was broken on the project on July 20, 1982 in a rather unusual manner. Using a network of four satellites and five earth stations, a signal was radioed around the world two times before it triggered a pre-set explosion at the building site. The complex was built in two phases, with Phase I being completed first in 1984 and Phase II following in 1988. While Andrews' contribution was positively cited as that of a creative professional, the project was marred by the embezzlement of five million dollars by Intelsat's director general and deputy. Aerial view of the complex The complex consists of fourteen interconnected rectangular \\"pods\\" clustered in groups of four around taller glass and stainless steel atria. The circular stairwells external to the pods are constructed of glass bricks and concrete. Unusual for the time, the design incorporated environmentally conscious elements that contribute to energy efficiency, such as the use of tinted-glass sunscreens and the open-air atria that admit sunlight while reflecting direct sun. At the time of its construction, the new INTELSAT headquarters was one of the first “green buildings” in Washington, DC. This was a characteristic that reflected the attitudes towards environmental sustainability in the U.S. during the 1970s. Also, the complex incorporates interior and exterior water features for cooling and terraced roof gardens to complement the large trees preserved by the site plan. INTELSAT’s design became an important model for environmentally conscious and energy saving architecture. While the building is , only is usable office space, with the remainder being taken up by the lengthy corridor down the center of the building, the atria, and other public spaces. Intelsat was the initial occupant, but after its privatization in 1999 and its later mergers with PanAmSat, COMSAT and parts of Loral, its continued presence at the site has been uncertain. This is partially as it is looking for a smaller complex. The embassies of Cameroon, Honduras, and Monaco are currently housed in the building. Other occupants have included the embassies of Belize, Botswana, and Swaziland and WJLA Channel 7. Reception The Connecticut Avenue entrance Andrews said his design expressed \\"a spirit of openness, of optimism, of faith in cooperation between peoples and groups of people, and the use of modern technology.\\" However, since its construction, reception has been mixed. Some consider it \\"a Connecticut Avenue landmark and a must-see for futurists touring the nation’s capital\\" because of its unique high-tech design and energy efficiency. Early in its existence, it was noted as being a positive repudiation of architectural conservatism, however, its style was not duplicated and therefore it stands out from the surrounding city. Other critics also note that it does not interact well with the surrounding buildings and add that it can be difficult for visitors to find the entrance given its odd shape and placement. it had been studied by the Historic Preservation Section of the D.C. Office of Planning as a potential landmark of Modern architecture, but a 2011 architectural-historical review of the area as part of the University of the District of Columbia's student center construction planning found that Intelsat was not old enough for landmark status and was a \\"visual shock\\" to the neighborhood, given its arguably inappropriate design and sitting for an urban area. The review did indicate that this opinion could change as the building aged further. And it did. In January of 2017 the Intelsat Headquarters was nominated for historic designation by the DC Preservation League (DCPL). The INTELSAT Headquarters building was nominated under DC Criterion A for important historical events, because of its associated with telecommunication achievements. It also falls under Criterion B for history because it served as Intelsat’s home. Due to its historical significance, it is also eligible under the National Register Criterion A for history. The building was also nominated under the District of Columbia Criterion D and the National Register Criterion C for its architecture. In addition to that, it was nominated under DC Criterion F as the work of a master architect. John Andrews’ work has been recognized internationally and has had other buildings designated as historic sites. The INTELSAT headquarters building was designated as a landmark in the DC Inventory of Historic Sites by the Historic Preservation Review Board in April 2019.Historic Preservation Review Board, Historic Landmark Case No. 14-19, Washington, D.C., April 25, 2019.

A privately financed invasion fleet had sailed a week previously from several ports on the Humber estuary with the aim of pressing the claim of Edward Baliol to the Scottish throne. The invaders had begun their disembarkation when they were confronted by a force of Bruce loyalists led by Duncan, Earl of Fife and Robert Bruce, Lord of Liddesdale. The leaders of the defenders appear to have been confused and indecisive about tactics. When a body of men-at-arms suddenly charged towards the invaders they were cut down by longbow fire.

Martha Burton Woodhead was born March 6, 1843, in the English town of Rothwell, West Yorkshire, and emigrated with her family to Cincinnati, Ohio, the following year. She was educated in Ohio and later in Iowa, attending Burlington College with an emphasis in philosophy, but never graduated. In 1866 she married Civil War veteran Charles Wesley Williamson, and they had three daughters. Williamson's journalism career began in 1877, and she was a correspondent for James A. Garfield's 1880 presidential campaign. Her articles appeared in Indiana and Missouri, and in 1882 she became associate editor of the Terre Haute Enterprise in Indiana. She became an active participant in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. In 1887 (at age 44) she and her family moved to Los Angeles, California and started collecting seashells. It was in Los Angeles that she became active in malacology, the study of mollusks. She researched the marine family of gastropods, Mitridae, the miters. She proposed 11 new names for mollusks, at least two of which are still valid: Crepidula naticarum and Crepidula norrisiarum. Williamson maintained a correspondence with William Healey Dall and J. G. Cooper. She is commemorated in the names of the snail Vitrinella williamsoni and the fossil clam Macrocallista williamsoni.

During the episode, Elena remembers when life was simpler while the rest of her friends attempt to stay away from Alaric. In the episode's initial airing, it garnered 2.53 million viewers. Plot In the third season finale, Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev) recovers in the hospital from her fall in the previous episode. Jeremy brings her back home, where Caroline Forbes (Candice Accola), Bonnie Bennett (Kat Graham), Jeremy Gilbert (Steven R. McQueen), Matt Donovan (Zach Roerig) and Tyler Lockwood (Michael Trevino) take care of her. In the harsh reality of the present situation, Elena longs for simpler times when her parents, Grayson (Jason MacDonald) and Miranda Gilbert (Erin Beute), and aunt Jenna Sommers (Sara Canning) were still alive, and her biggest concern was her relationship with Matt. In a conversation with Matt, Elena tells him that Stefan was there at a time in her life when she had nothing, but that when she is with Damon, she feels a passion for him that consumes her. As this is happening, Damon Salvatore (Ian Somerhalder) and Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley) transport a neutralized Klaus (Joseph Morgan) away from Mystic Falls. Jeremy calls them and tells them about Elena's injury and her being in the hospital. Since one of them has to continue on to dispose of Klaus, only Stefan can return to Mystic Falls. Alaric Saltzman (Matt Davis) tries to convince Jeremy to tell him the location of Klaus, believing that Jeremy will also want to get rid of all vampires to protect his sister. Jeremy instead leaks false information to Alaric from Damon. When Elijah Mikaelson (Daniel Gillies) comes back into town, he strikes a deal with Elena, Bonnie, and the Salvatores, promising that in exchange for Klaus, he will revive Klaus generations later. Damon and Bonnie go to retrieve Klaus, but Alaric ambushes Damon. Rebekah arrives and tries to save Klaus, but Alaric manages to stake the neutralized Klaus. Damon, Stefan, Caroline and Tyler immediately worry because Klaus is the originator of their bloodline. An hour later, however, they're still alive which confuses Elijah and Rebekah, as they were positive that Klaus originated their bloodline and were sure it wasn't Kol Mikaelson (Nathaniel Buzolic). Unbeknownst to them, Bonnie created a spell to transfer Klaus into Tyler's body, meaning Klaus is still alive. She did this to save her friends and her mother (Persia White) who also stems from the same bloodline. Matt forces Elena to leave Mystic Falls with him to keep her away from the vampire attacks that have recently put her in harm's way. On the way, Elena realizes she loves Stefan and between her love for him and for Damon, she chooses Stefan, claiming that perhaps if she had met Damon first, things would be different (however, in a flashback it is revealed she did meet Damon first although he compelled her to forget the encounter). Rebekah, enraged and desolate, decides to kill Alaric by killing Elena and causes them to drive off a bridge. Alaric dies in Damon's arms after Elena drowns, but appears to Jeremy as a ghost to say goodbye. Damon realizes Alaric's death means Elena must have died and rushes to the hospital where Meredith Fell (Torrey DeVitto) reveals that when Elena was in the hospital earlier in the day, she had suffered from cerebral hemorrhaging so Meredith had given Elena vampire blood to heal and save her. The consequences of the vampire blood treatment and Elena's drowning are then revealed as Elena opens her eyes in the hospital, in transition to becoming a vampire. Development The episode marks a pivotal point in the series; where Elena begins transition marks a change in the series' dynamic. The plot to turn Elena had been in the works since the series began, where executive producers Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec had signed on to the project and agreed that at some point, she would be turned.Post Mortem: Vampire Diaries Boss on Finale Gamechanger, Elena's Choice and Who's a Goner by Vlada Gelman of TV Line, May 11, 2012.

He and his team called it Integrated Inventory Management, abbreviated I2M in the late 70's. They believed that the term was catchy and the I2M acronym would be well received, but it all changed during a key steering committee meeting with Dutch electronics giant Philips. At the meeting, he and his team found out that their catchy phrase was not that catchy, and Oliver was challenged by one of the customer's managers, Mr. Van t'Hoff. Oliver explained Mr. Van t'Hoff what he meant by I2M: “We’re talking about the management of a chain of supply as though it were a single entity,” Mr. Oliver replied, “not a group of disparate functions.” “Then why don’t you call it that?” Mr. Van t’Hoff said. “Call it what?” Mr. Oliver asked. “Total supply chain management.” Scott Stephens, Former Chair of the Supply-Chain Council (SCC) (1983–1997) and Former Chief Technology Officer of the SCC (1997–2005) states in his blog that after knowing the story, he was not really sure if it was Keith Oliver or Mr. Van t'Hoff who coined the term. But as Oliver developed the concept prior to the meeting and used it first in public during the Financial Times interview, gives credit to Oliver's story to be the Ring of Truth.http://measuredperformance.blogspot.com/2007/12/defining-supply- chain-management-whos_05.html Keith Oliver's Supply Chain Management definition Oliver defined in 1982 the Supply Chain concept as follows: “Supply chain management (SCM) is the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the operations of the supply chain with the purpose to satisfy customer requirements as efficiently as possible. Supply chain management spans all movement and storage of raw materials, work-in-process inventory, and finished goods from point-of-origin to point-of- consumption”.http://www.supplychainrecruit.com/content/supply-chain- explained-26.htm Since then, almost all Supply Chain Book authors have developed their own definitions. Some of them are subtle variations and others add more detail, but most of them remain close to Oliver's original definition.. Supply Chain Management term adulthood and 30th anniversary Keith Oliver was highlighted and often cited in articles and books during the 2002-2003 period due to the fact that the Supply Chain Management term reached its adulthood with 21 years. Supply Chain Management's term adulthood was an opportunity for some publications to reflect about the concept's evolution in 21 years.http://www.informationweek.com/news/10100101 A similar effect is being experienced in 2012 due to the term's 30th anniversary.

The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \\"real world\\" town by a powerful curse. In this episode, Emma tries to discover her destiny; and Regina is tied up. While Prince Charming tries to escape from The Evil Queen and reunite with Snow White. It was co-written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, while Dean White served as director. Plot =Opening sequence= The Dark Curse rumbles through the forest. =In the characters' past= In the Enchanted Forest, as Prince Charming (Josh Dallas) attempts to escape from the Evil Queen's (Lana Parrilla) palace, he finds himself outnumbered by her guards. Just as it seems he will be recaptured, the Huntsman (Jamie Dornan) comes to his aid and kills the guards with his arrows, allowing Charming to escape and continue on his quest to find Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin). En route, Charming is transported to an infinite forest, thanks to the Queen and her mirror. Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle) appears and offers to help him but Charming refuses. They fight with swords; Rumpelstiltskin toys with him and soon disarms him. Charming notices his mother's wedding ring is missing. Rumpelstiltskin holds it up and he offers Charming a deal: he will give the prince back his mother's wedding ring, now enchanted to lead him straight to Snow White, if Charming will put a golden egg containing a potion of true love inside \\"the belly of the beast.\\" On his search for the beast, Prince Charming enters a castle and finds Maleficent (Kristin Bauer van Straten), seated on a throne. She turns into a dragon – the beast – to attack Charming. He throws the egg into Maleficent's gills and, after he escapes, Rumpelstiltskin returns the ring and magically dresses him in a new set of clothes with which to make his grand return to his true love. As seen in the series premiere, Charming races to Snow White's glass coffin, opens it and kisses her, waking her up. He proposes and she accepts. Together, they begin planning to take back the kingdom from the Evil Queen and Charming's sinister father, King George. =In Storybrooke= Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) has collapsed after eating the poisoned apple turnover intended for Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison). She rushes him to the hospital. Dr. Whale (David Anders) asks Emma if the child has eaten anything or if anything untoward has happened. She shows the doctor the turnover but he dismisses any idea of poison because Henry is not showing any symptoms. Almost immediately, Emma begins to suspect magic as the cause. She looks at the Once Upon a Time book, which magically shows her flashbacks of her birth and the night the curse began. It is only now that she finally believes. As Regina (Parrilla) enters the room to see Henry, Emma violently confronts her. A stunned and guilty Regina blurts out that the turnover was indeed meant for her and that the curse is real. The only one who may be able to help them save Henry is Mr. Gold (Carlyle) who is, in fact, Rumpelstiltskin. The two visit Mr. Gold, who now knows that Emma believes in the curse. He tells them that true love has the ability to break any curse and that, as a safeguard, he had imbued the curse's parchment with a drop of that potion made from Snow White and Prince Charming's love. Since Emma is also a product of Snow White and Prince Charming, she is the only one who can end the curse once and for all. Emma will have to retrieve the rest of the potion from its hiding-place in the belly of a beast. He presents her with her father's sword as a weapon against the beast. As to the potion, it is with Regina's oldest and only friend. Elsewhere, David Nolan (Dallas) meets Mary Margaret Blanchard (Goodwin) and tells her that ever since he awoke from the coma, the only thing that has ever made sense to him was her. He goes on to say that he plans on leaving town and moving to Boston unless Mary Margaret gives him a reason to stay. Mary Margaret, moved by his words, still cannot bring herself to take him back and leaves. Before Emma goes on her quest, she returns to the hospital where she apologizes to the unconscious Henry for not believing him. She then goes to August Booth (Eion Bailey) in an attempt to enlist his help and finds him lying in bed. Now that she believes, she can at last perceive August's body becoming wooden. There is just enough time for her to hear his last words of encouragement before he reverts to puppet form. At the hospital, Regina also apologizes to Henry but is interrupted by Jefferson (Sebastian Stan), who has come to demand the completion of the deal made with Regina to reunite him and his daughter. Regina refuses, on the spurious grounds that Emma had not eaten the turnover as planned. As Regina leaves to join Emma, Jefferson sneaks into the hospital’s underground asylum to release Belle (Emilie de Ravin), instructing her to find Mr. Gold and enlighten him about Regina's doings. Regina takes Emma to a secret room inside the boarded-up Storybrooke Public Library clock tower. The room contains an elevator, but only one person can go down while the other operates it. Despite her hatred and mistrust for Regina, Emma decides she will descend while Regina stays above ground. As Emma arrives to the bottom, she sees Snow White's glass coffin, then finds herself face-to- face with Maleficent in dragon form. Emma starts fighting with the dragon, but discards the sword and instead fires her gun repeatedly at the beast. She soon realizes that the sword is the only way to kill the dragon. She retrieves the sword and hurls it at the dragon, causing it to explode and release the golden egg containing the love potion. Meanwhile, Mary Margaret is reading Henry's storybook to him in his hospital bed. As she reads he begins to flat-line. As Emma ascends in the elevator, it suddenly stops working. She hears Mr. Gold by the controls above her. He tells her that Regina has abandoned her then suggests that Emma should throw the egg up to him and he will wait for her as she climbs up. She complies. When Emma reaches the surface, Gold is nowhere to be found. Regina is tied up and gagged. Emma rescues her, and as they go after Gold, they simultaneously receive calls from the hospital regarding Henry. When they arrive, they learn that he has died and both grieve. A devastated Emma goes to Henry's body, whispers to him that she loves him and kisses him on the forehead. This act is seen as \\"true love's kiss:\\", therefore the pure love shockwave occurs. Emma has broken the curse, bringing Henry back to life and causes everyone in Storybrooke to regain their memories. The Blue Fairy (Keegan Connor Tracy) suggests to Regina that she had best find somewhere to hide as everyone she has wronged will want revenge. Regina runs away, but not before telling a silently-watching Henry that she truly does love him. She returns to her mansion, lamenting her defeat and the loss of the only person she loves. Regaining his memories, David returns to town and finds Mary Margaret, calling out \\"Snow!\\" She responds by calling him Charming, confirming that they both remember. They embrace and rejoice in the fact that they have found each other again. Elsewhere around town, other Storybrooke residents are hit by the pure love shockwave, and they remember their fairytale past including Ruby (Red Riding Hood), Granny, and Archie Hopper (Jiminy Cricket). Back at the pawn shop, Gold is preparing an as-yet-unknown plan involving the potion, when Belle enters to tell him about what Regina had done to her. Gold is shocked to see Belle still alive and overjoyed to have her back. He sets off for the woods to launch his plan and takes her with him. On their way, the curse is broken and Belle regains her memories, declaring her love for Gold. He tells Belle they will have all the time in the world, but now, they must continue with the plan. They walk further and reach the wishing well in the woods. Gold tells Belle that the waters that run beneath it have the power to return what one has lost. He drops the love potion into the wishing well, which causes massive amounts of purple smoke to spew out of the well and spread around them. When Belle asks what is happening, Gold tells her that he is bringing the magic that they had once lost back to their world. When asked why, he tells her that magic is power. The purple smoke spreads quickly and engulfs everything (and everyone) in town. Regina watches from her mansion and deviously smiles, knowing that she will once again regain her magical powers. The last scene shows Prince Charming and Snow White standing in the street holding each other as the purple smoke engulfs them and the clock tower. The hand of the clock moves to the infamous special time: 8:15. Production \\"A Land Without Magic\\" was co-written by series co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, while The Shield veteran Dean White returned to direct the episode. The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013. Reception =Ratings= The finale saw the series post its best numbers ever from the previous outing, scoring a 3.3/10 among 18-49s with 9.66 million viewers tuning in.

In Canada, the episode finished in eighteenth place for the week with an estimated 1.532 million viewers, a decrease from the 1.601 million of the previous episode. =Reviews= The season finale was well received by critics, especially from Entertainment Weekly's Hilary Busis, who stated that \\"Lo and behold, earlier this evening I found that all my deepest desires had been granted (Busis made a quote about wanting to see Bauer and Dornan return and for Emma to drop the Scully routine). As executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz promised, \\"'A Land Without Magic' was a total game- changer—and Once will be an even stronger show next season, thanks to its revelations.

Plot =In King's Landing= Tyrion and Bronn plan the defense of King's Landing with the aid of old texts. When Tyrion is accused of plotting to kill King Joffrey, Cersei mistakenly kidnaps Ros instead of Shae, and Tyrion swears to Cersei that she will pay for her actions.

Varys informs Tyrion that Daenerys is alive with three dragons. =At sea= Planning the siege of King's Landing, Stannis and Davos reminisce about Robert's Rebellion. Stannis remains bitter that Renly was given Storm's End, and vows to make Davos his Hand once he takes the Iron Throne. =At Harrenhal= As Tywin departs to face Robb's army, Arya is unable to find Jaqen H'ghar in time for him to kill Tywin, and instead forces him to help her escape. That night, Jaqen kills the castle's guards, allowing Arya, Gendry, and Hot Pie to escape. =In the Westerlands= Robb returns from the Crag with Talisa to learn Jaime has escaped. Catelyn admits that Brienne is escorting Jaime to King's Landing to trade for Sansa and Arya, and Robb has Catelyn placed under guard.

Production =Writing= The episode was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. The episode was written by producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, based on the original work of George R. R.

Among the added material there are the relationship between Talisa and Robb (which in the books happen offscreen and in an entirely different context) and the Qarth plot (which is still only loosely based on the books). Other changes include Arya using her third \\"death\\" to flee Harrenhal instead of contributing to the fall of the castle to Bolton's Northmen, revealing the hidden cache of “dragonglass” found after Jon's departure, and having the wildlings capture Qhorin Halfhand alive. =Casting= Edward Dogliani joins the guest cast of the show playing the wildling leader Rattleshirt, also known as \\"the Lord of Bones.\\" Reception =Ratings= The first airing of \\"The Prince of Winterfell\\" matched the series high ratings with 3.86 million viewers and a 2.0 share among the 18–49 demographic.

Danziger and Harry Lee Danziger, directed by Paul Dickson, and starring Kieron Moore, Lois Maxwell, Donald Wolfit, and Bryan Forbes. The film was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Special effects were by Wally Veevers, who would later work on Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Plot After initial experiments using high-speed aircraft are finally successful, scientists in Great Britain plan to launch the \\"Stardust\\", the first manned spaceship to venture into outer space. Some of the crew members have concerned loved ones. Barbara (Thea Gregory), the wife of Larry Noble (Jimmy Hanley), and Ellen (Shirley Lawrence), the girlfriend of radio operator Jimmy Wheeler (Bryan Forbes), are afraid that the space flight will be dangerous. Although the crew, headed by Commander Michael Haydon (Kieron Moore), initially believe they are on a scientific mission, the \\"meteorologist\\" on board, Professor Merrity (Donald Wolfit), is revealed to be actually working for the United States to test an experimental nuclear \\"tritonium\\" bomb. The object is to use the super-powerful explosion to persuade nations to abandon nuclear weapons. Complications arise when a crew member discovers a stowaway. Troublesome reporter Kim Hamilton (Lois Maxwell) who has been very vocal about the worth of the mission and of space exploration in general, had impulsively stowed away the night before to get a first-hand experience of the flight and its crew. The tritonium bomb is released from the ship into space, but when its propulsion unit fails and the bomb magnetically attaches itself to the hull of the spaceship, everyone's life is threatened. The crew and their surprise guest race against time to defuse or escape the bomb.

Footage of the Avro Vulcan and the Folland Midge, the prototype for the later Folland Gnat aircraft series, was featured in the beginning of the film, as scientists push the envelope of high-speed flight and test exotic rocket fuels. The Midge portrays a fictional jet fighter used to test an experimental fuel. Wally Veevers' extensive model work with miniatures and matte paintings is notable. The model rocket looks futuristic, though a familiar period design, using a long, angled ramp (à la When Worlds Collide) to launch the rocket into space.

He was a Member of the Parliament of Jamaica since 2007 before losing his seat to Jamaica Labour Party Candidate and Attorney-at-Law,Tamika Davis, at the September 3,2020 parliamentary elections. Career Hayles returned to Jamaica from abroad hoping in 2000 to contribute to Jamaica's development, and wrote to PNP Prime Minister P. J. Patterson with the aim of getting involved in politics. However he ended up joining the Jamaica Labour Party instead. He rose to the position of president of the JLP affiliate group Generation 2000, but in the end resigned from the JLP along with Norman Horne and ran under the PNP banner for the Hanover Western seat in the September 2007 election. His victory made him one of the youngest MPs. However, soon after the election the defeated JLP candidate Donovan Hamilton filed an election petition in the Supreme Court, challenging Hayles' eligibility to be nominated due to his U.S. citizenship. On 23 October 2007, Hayles swore an oath of renunciation of U.S. nationality and submitted his U.S. passport for cancellation; the U.S. State Department later issued him a Certificate of Loss of Nationality dated 25 October 2007. The court case still was not resolved by January 2012, though there were suggestions that Hamilton and Hayles might settle. After the December 2011 election, PM Portia Simpson-Miller appointed Hayles the new State Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries under minister Roger Clarke. In the September 3,2020 parliamentary elections,he lost his seat to the Jamaica Labour Party candidate and newcomer,Tamika Davis. Personal life Hayles was born in George's Plain, Westmoreland Parish, a PNP stronghold. His mother Pauline Brown was an organiser for the PNP. He later moved to Blenheim, Hanover Parish and then to Cave Hill in the same parish, and then emigrated to the United States with his family at age 13. He attended university there before returning to Jamaica.

It was the second of a series of four such abortive settlement attempts in Australia's Top End, the first being Fort Dundas (1824–1828) on Melville Island, the third Fort Victoria or Victoria Settlement, at Port Essington (1838–1849) on the Cobourg Peninsula, and the fourth at Escape Cliffs (1864–1867) near the mouth of the Adelaide River. History James Stirling established Fort Wellington in 1827 Following unsatisfactory reports of the Fort Dundas settlement, Captain James Stirling was sent from Sydney in May 1827 aboard and the Mary Elizabeth to establish a new settlement east of Melville Island. On 18 June 1827 he took formal possession of Raffles Bay where he landed an establishment force, with their supplies, on the eastern shore and named the outpost Fort Wellington. The force comprised Commandant Captain H.G. Smyth and 30 soldiers from the 39th Regiment, 14 marines, a surgeon, storekeeper and 22 convicts. From the beginning the settlement suffered from diseases such as scurvy, attacks by hostile Aborigines, and the logistical problems arising from its isolation. The hoped for trade with the East Indies failed to eventuate. Despite the arrival In September 1828 of Captain Collet Barker as the new Commandant, who established better relations with the local Aborigines, the settlement was abandoned in August 1829.

The College was founded by the Congregation of Christian Brothers in 1929, and since 1982 has been conducted by lay staff appointed by the Diocese of Broken Bay. As a regional secondary school, St Paul's provides for the boys of the Catholic Parishes of Manly Freshwater (including Curl Curl, Fairlight, Freshwater, Manly), North Harbour (including Allambie, Balgowlah, Clontarf, Manly Vale, Seaforth), and Warringah (including Beacon Hill, Brookvale, Cromer, Dee Why, and Narraweena).  History  St Paul's College owes its origins to Monsignor John MacDonald, Parish Priest of Manly. In 1924 Monsignor MacDonald made a request for Christian Brothers to open and run a school for boys on the northern beaches. The Brothers were renown throughout the British Isles and Empire for providing a good education in the Catholic tradition for boys from poor families. \\"No boy,\\" they had long said, \\"would be excluded from the school because of the inability or unwillingness of his parents or guardians to pay school fees.\\" The Congregation responded by sending four Brothers: T. N. Bourke, P. B. Costello, H. F. Gygar, and T. P. O'Connor, who established their monastery and school in Manly, next to the Parish Church in Raglan Street. Christian Brothers' Manly opened on 29 January 1929 and welcomed 123 students, a great undertaking for four Brothers. The school doubled in size in just four years, with 250 boys enrolled in 1933. The Second World War was the catalyst for the establishment of the Cadet Corps, which was later disbanded in 1962. Other long-standing features of school life included football, cricket, swimming, athletics, boxing, wrestling tournaments, and annual dramatic and musical concerts. The boys' choirs sang for Sunday Mass and afternoon Benediction at Mary Immaculate Church, Manly. The Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal Gilroy, moved the College in 1965 from Raglan Street to its present site on Manly's Eastern Hill, in the grounds of St Patrick's Estate. The new College buildings cost A₤125,000. These were added to in the 1970s, and included science laboratories paid for by some of the first Commonwealth Government funding for private schools. The Cardinal's Palace, on the same land as the College, hosted Year 12 classes in the dining room; since 2005 the Cardinal's Palace has been wholly used by the College for its administration, leadership, and staff centre. To these buildings the Waterford Centre was added in 2015, which boasts views of Sydney's Middle Harbour and a large multi-purpose space for sport and assembly. In 1982 Brian Mayne was appointed the first lay Principal of the College. There have been a total of six lay Principals: Messrs Brian Mayne, Kenneth Doyle, Andrew Martin, Christopher Comerford, Mark Baker, and Christopher Browne (since 2017).  Traditions  The College Year begins with Mass, usually celebrated at Mary Immaculate Church, Manly, in which parish the College was founded and is situated. The local Catholic clergy provide chaplaincy services and liturgical support. Assemblies throughout the year commemorate religious festivals and special occasions: Ash Wednesday and Lent, ANZAC Day, Holy Week and Easter, Remembrance Day, Advent and Christmas. Students and staff together raise funds for charitable purposes: Project Compassion, Catholic Mission, Society of St Vincent de Paul. The Dux of the College and other prize-winners are recognised at the annual Year in Review. The College awards a number of trophies, plates, and cups to high achieving sportsmen. Support for the College and community spirit are generated by the Parents' and Friends' Association.  College crest  The shield of the College displays the Cross of Christ, the proudly- borne standard of the loyal and resilient disciple of Jesus. The Celtic form of the Cross hearkens back to the foundation of the College by the Christian Brothers, who were themselves founded by an Irishman, Edmund Ignatius Rice. The star stands for the Blessed Virgin Mary, specially invoked locally under her title \\"Star of the Sea\\" in honour of the unfailing guidance and direction she gives to travellers and pilgrims. The colours are also deeply symbolic: in heraldry, red is often associated with zeal and courage, and black with luxuriance - together, the colours speak of the hope of every member of the College for personal success, which comes through hard striving in all circumstances. The shield is laid on an open scroll which bears the name of the College patron, St Paul the Apostle, and the motto, Prima Primum (First things first).  Motto  The Latin motto of the College, Prima Primum (First things first), is a challenge to students to order wisely life's competing priorities. To live well, a St Paul's boy will not allow himself to be swamped by the many and varied claims on his time and talents, but will instead be inspired to search among them for the one thing which is necessary and reorder all else under and around it. Once having found God, the St Paul's boy will see clearly what comes next, and what can next be taken up without losing the greater, more important.  Curriculum  These subjects are undertaken by Year 7 students: Geography, History, English, Mathematics, Music, PDHPE, Religious Education, Science, Sport, Technology, and Visual Arts.

Biography He was born in Drøbak in Akershus, Norway. He was a son of shipmaster, merchant and lighthouse manager Abraham Georg Sørensen and Nancy Samuelson. He was a brother of Niels Georg Sørensen. The family moved to Lindesnes in 1842. He worked at sea from the age of thirteen, but in 1844 he moved with the family to Hustadvika when his father became manager of Kvitholmen Lighthouse. At the age of seventeen Sørensen became a shop clerk in Kristiansund. In 1868 he married German citizen Anna Henriette Dick (1843–1921). Sørensen moved to Spain in 1857 to trade dried and salted cod. His company was located in Santander, and soon expanded to include timber trade. In 1862 a branch office was opened in Bilbao, where a mechanical workshop was also established. From 1867 to 1871 he was the consul for Denmark in Spain. He gradually relocated his business to Sweden, where he established a sawmill Säfveåns AB in Göteborg with his brothers during 1874. In 1880 he moved back to Norway, residing at the property Fagerstrand near Høvik. His interests in the companies in Spain and Sweden was gradually discontinued, but the companies were still run by others. Sørensen had received education through private tutoring in Kristiansund, where he also used the library at his workplace. He became a part of the liberal movement, and became active in culture and society in the 1880s. In 1884 he replaced Olaf Norli as a partner of Olaf Huseby in the book store and publishing house Huseby & Co. Among their publications were books such as Albertine by Christian Krohg, which was confiscated by the police. They also published the periodical Nyt Tidsskrift, edited by Olaf Skavlan and Ernst Sars. Sørensen was the first publisher of cheap books for the mass market in Norway. In 1887 he established his own publishing house, Bibliothek for de tusen hjems forlag, where the goal was to mass-produce intellectual and political works for ordinary people, in a series called Bibliothek for de tusen hjem. The first book in the series was Bjørnson's story Støv. In addition to liberal Norwegian writers, the series would contain authors such as Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley, Herbert Spencer, Thomas Carlyle, Charles Dickens, Émile Zola and Alphonse Daudet. In seven years, Sørensen published 130 books in a circulation of about 600,000 copies. He has thus been credited for bringing European ideas such as positivism and evolutionism to the peripheral nation Norway. Sørensen sold his publishing house in 1895. He had struggled with asthma, and stayed at two sanatoriums in Sør-Fron, Tofte and in the Lauvåsen neighborhood of Kristiansand. He died at Tofte Sanatorium in October 1918.

After it was shipped to Montreal for the 1910 Montreal Air Meet, Hubbard was unsuccessful in flying the aircraft, it possibly being too low-powered to do more than taxiing.

The intent was to enter the aircraft at the Harvard-Boston Aero Meet in Boston.

It was designed and built at the Bell Boatyard on Bell's Beinn Bhreagh estate near Baddeck, Nova Scotia. In 1919, it set a world marine speed record of .  History  The March 1906 Scientific American article by American pioneer William E. Meacham, explained the basic principle of hydrofoils and hydroplanes. Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane a very significant achievement. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor Enrico Forlanini and began testing models based on his designs, which led them to the development of hydrofoil watercraft. Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. Bell, with his chief engineer Casey Baldwin, began hydrofoil experiments in the summer of 1908. During Bell's world tour of 1910–1911, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in Italy, where they rode in his hydrofoil boat over Lake Maggiore. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. On returning to Bell's large laboratory and boatyard at his Beinn Bhreagh estate near Baddeck, Nova Scotia, they experimented with a number of designs, culminating in HD-4. In 1913, Dr. Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in Westmount to work on the pontoons of HD-4. Pinaud soon took over the Bell Boatyard at Beinn Bhreagh. Pinaud's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to HD-4. After the First World War, work began again on HD-4. Bell's report to the U.S. Navy permitted him to obtain two Liberty V-12 engines in July 1919. Bell and associate Frederick W. \\"Casey\\" Baldwin began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908, as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. On September 9, 1919, on the Bras d'Or Lakes, at Baddeck, HD-4 set a world marine speed record of , that stood for almost a year until being beaten by Gar Wood in Miss America.http://www.h1unlimited.com/2009/03/the-gar-wood-story/  Museum display  Alexander Graham Bell museum A full-scale replica of Bell's HD-4 is viewable at the Alexander Graham Bell museum in Baddeck, Nova Scotia, Canada.

It was one of six species that appeared as part of a series depicting native New Zealand fungi on stamps, released in 2002. Taxonomy The species was originally described in 1924 by Gordon Herriot Cunningham as Secotium porphyreum, from collections made in Wellington. In 1954 Rolf Singer transferred it to Thaxterogaster when he erected that genus to contain species with Cortinarius-like spores that had a reduced stipe and gills that were only partially exposed, or the hymenium was loculate (divided into small cavities or compartments). It acquired its current name in 2002 when molecular studies demonstrated that Thaxterogaster was polyphyletic and nested within Cortinarius. In an article recommending English language common names for several endemic New Zealand fungi, Geoff Ridley proposes the name \\"king's pouch\\". Description The violet fruit bodies can grow to a height and width of . The smooth, polished surface of the peridium is sticky. When dry, the peridium becomes brown and develops wrinkles. The stout stipe is a pale violet colour with yellow tints at the base. It measures long by thick at the base and tapers towards the top. The texture of the stipe surface is fibrillose (as if made of fibers), and minute grooves can be seen running up and down its length. The interior of the peridium, the gleba, is pale reddish brown in colour and labyrinthiform (with complicated sinuous lines or winding passages) in form. Individual cells or compartments in the gleba are typically 1–2 mm long with thick partitions. Young fruit bodies that are still beneath the earth are white; as they mature and emerge from the ground, the exposure to light causes the color to change to violet. In deposit, the spores are chestnut brown. Microscopic examination reveals that they are egg-shaped with one end rounded and the other end pointed, measuring 12–17 by 8–11 μm. The spore surface is covered with minute wart-like outgrowths.

Accessed on 14 May 2012. () is a circular, long-distance, cycle route in the German district of Minden-Lübbecke and its neighbouring areas in North Rhine-Westphalia. The route is laid out in such a way as to take in 43 historic mills along a circular route of about 320 kilometres. Running along largely quiet country roads, the Westphalian Mill Route takes cyclists through a cultural landscape dominated by the Wiehen and Weser Hills, the North German Plain and the River Weser. As increasing numbers of tourists have used the network of cycleways, tourist accommodation and restaurants have been established on the main routes. There are northern and southern variants of the Mill Route. Both may also be combined with the Minden Museum Railway (e. g. at Hille, Südhemmern, Kleinenbremen), the museum railway at Rahden (e. g. Tonnenheide, Rahden) or the Minden pleasure boats (Südhemmern).  Northern route  The northern route starts at the ship mill in Minden. Running initially alongside the River Weser it makes for Petershagen, where it crosses the river. After swinging around in a wide loop it returns to Petershagen via Schlüsselburg. This section is about 65 km long and runs past 11 mills. Preußisch Oldendorf-Holzhausen: Haus des Gastes From Petershagen the cycleway runs through Hille to Espelkamp and Rahden. In the Rahden village of Tonnenheide is the so-called Große Stein (\\"Great Rock\\"), the largest glacial erratic in northwest Germany, and in the museum farm (Museumshof) is one of the two Rossmühlen (\\"Stallion Mills\\") on the Mill Route. This section is also about 65 kilometres long. From Rahden the route continues through Oppenwehe to Levern. In the vicinity of Oppenwehe is the Oppenwehe Moor. Its next goal, opposite the Wiehen Hills, is Preußisch Oldendorf, a town with three state- approved climatic health spas. A special route links the palaces and manor houses around the town. From here the cyclist must choose whether to follow the northern variant or southern variant of the Mill Route. The northern tour goes via Lübbecke and past the Großes Torfmoor before returning to Minden. From Rahden to Minden, the distance is about 85 kilometres.  Southern route  The southern route runs from Preußisch Oldendorf through Hüllhorst, Bad Oeynhausen and Porta Westfalica to Minden. The length of this tour is around 95 kilometres. Unlike the hitherto largely flat section, the route now crosses the heights of the Wiehen(Wiehengebirge) and later the Weser Hills (Wesergebirge). After visiting the windmill of Hüllhorst-Schnathorst or the water mill of Schöne Mühle in Wulferdingsen (near Bad Oeynhausen) cyclists can switch to the northern route at the so-called Wallücke (\\"dyke gap\\") up an incline. The main route continues along the Weser, passing through Holzhausen (wind mill) and along the Weser Cycleway before returning to Minden, avoiding a climb over the Weser Hills. This route runs past Kleinenbremen, where there is the so-called Show Mine.

In Thai, the word “Khanom” () means dessert, “Chan” () means layer. It is usually steamed in the complete 9 layer form. The number nine itself has connotations of prosperity in Thai culture (in Thai, 'nine' also sounds like ‘progress’). Khanom Chan therefore represents prosperity in life and promotion in your occupation. Khanom Chan is fragrant, subtly sweet and slightly oily from the addition of coconut milk. The texture is smooth yet sticky.Khanom Chan Ramkhamhaeng University 2003  History  From Sukhothai period, the dealing with foreign trade with China and India have contributed to cultural exchange, for example, food. During this period Thailand has begun to develop relations with foreign countries both East and West. This made Thailand develop food that comes from many nations and adapt it to suit the living conditions local people.  Beliefs  Khanom Chan in the past is used in sacred ceremony such as home philanthropy, wedding, etc. The design of Khanom Chan has nine layers or more because number nine and beyond in Thai belief is believed to bring happiness, progress for the maker and eater. From this belief, some of the local areas have other names for Khanom Chan to make it more prosperous called Khanom Chan Farh (ขนมชั้นฟ้า).  Ingredients  Khanom chan is made with tapioca flour, arrowroot starch, rice flour, mung bean flour, sugar, coconut milk, and food coloring or pandan juice.https://www.ku.ac.th/e-magazine/november43/dessert/chan.htm Tapioca flour is used to make the dessert soft, sticky, viscous and look transparent.

He was schooled by his father and his uncle Diego Hurtado de Mendoza y Quiñones. He was the brother of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, 1st Count of Melito. Rodrigo began his military career in the Granada War under the command of his uncle, Íñigo López de Mendoza y Quiñones, the 2nd Count of Tendilla. In 1492, Rodrigo married Leonor de le Cerda in a secret wedding. They would go on to live in the Castle of Jadraque which belonged to her family. After her death in 1497, he went to Italy where he became familiar with the architecture of the Italian Renaissance. After he returned to Spain, he married a second time with María de Fonseca y Toledo, ignoring the express wishes of the Isabella I of Castile who forbade the marriage. As punishment, he was incarcerated until the death of the queen in 1504. Upon his release from prison, he commissioned Lorenzo Vázquez de Segovia to build his wife the magnificent Castillo de La Calahorra in the Province of Granada. Before long, he left the palace for his dominions in Ayora in the Province of Valencia due to a confrontation between him and his uncle, Íñigo López de Mendoza y Quiñones. Rodrigo was favored in the dispute by Philip I of Castile and Íñigo by Ferdinand II of Aragon. Rodrigo moved permanently to Valencia after his brother was named Viceroy. He played an active political and military role in the quelling of the Revolt of the Brotherhoods. He there displayed great diplomatic skill which in turn kept him in Valencia even after the death of his brother.  Issue  With his second wife, María de Fonseca y Toledo: * Mencía de Mendoza, (1508–1554), campaigned for women's rights, renowned for her great sensibility and cultural prowess. * María de Mendoza, (1510-1580), who inherited the titles of Marquis of Cenete and Conde del Cid, married Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, 4th Count of Saldaña, first-born son of Íñigo López de Mendoza, the Duke of the Infantado. The aforementioned titles would pass onto the Dukes of the Infantado.

He is one of a small number of former Americans known to have voluntarily become stateless. Early life Gogulski's grandparents emigrated to the U.S. in the 19th century; his paternal grandparents from near Poznań, Poland and his maternal grandparents from Germany. Gogulski was born in Phoenix, Arizona, but his family moved to Orlando, Florida soon after due to his father's job as an electromechanical engineer. He has a younger sister, Karen. He attended Lake Howell High School, where he was a National Merit Scholarship Program finalist and a brain bowl team member; he graduated in 1990. Gogulski entered Orlando College in 1990 to study computer science. In April 1992, while still a student there and living in Casselberry, Florida, he became the first person to be arrested by the Orange County Sheriff's Office for computer hacking. Police stated that he had stolen at least $30,000 of long-distance telephone services. Among the victims of the theft were the county government, a tutorial service at the University of Florida, and an auto dealership. Charged with one count of violating the Florida Communications Fraud Act, he pleaded guilty in Seminole County Circuit Court; under a plea agreement, he received two years of probation, but a formal ruling of guilt was withheld and no further charges were filed. He later lost interest in his studies and withdrew from school. Nevertheless, he went on to a ten-year career as a system administrator. Gogulski's father died in 2001. In 2004, Gogulski left the U.S. to teach English in Eastern Europe. He eventually ended up in Bratislava, Slovakia, where he became a translator, proofreader, and editor. Mike Gogulski in Wrocław, Poland in 2004 Renunciation of citizenship Gogulski renounced his citizenship in December 2008, though his name did not appear in the Internal Revenue Service's Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen to Expatriate until February 2011. He was living in Slovakia at the time. After Gogulski renounced, the Slovak authorities issued a stateless person's travel document to him. He thus needs a United States visa in order to visit his mother, but he suspects that he would be unable to obtain one. He states that he is eligible to apply for Slovak citizenship, but prefers to remain stateless. As a legal resident of Slovakia, he can travel freely throughout the Schengen Area. In 2012 he was denied a British visa, an issue which he attributed to the short remaining validity period of his travel document. Gogulski stated that he renounced his citizenship in order to repudiate the American system, which he felt was the source of many wrongs in the world. Gogulski has stated that he hopes to start a mass movement of Americans giving up citizenship and making themselves stateless en masse. He receives occasional enquiries from others who are interested in following in his footsteps and becoming stateless themselves; he advises them to \\"understand all the implications\\" before they make the leap, pointing out that while he has faced few hardships due to his statelessness, others may find it more difficult due to their personal situations. Political activism In 1999, Gogulski founded the Connecticut Cannabis Policy Forum, which aimed to remove all penalties for adult marijuana consumption. In 2010, Gogulski founded the Private Manning Support Network, which organised protests in support of Chelsea Manning (a U.S. soldier convicted of disclosing classified documents to WikiLeaks) and raised $50,000 to fund her legal defense. Bitcoin As a software developer, Gogulski has contributed open source code on GitHub, including a PHP library for the decentralised digital currency bitcoin. He is also an active member of the online forum Bitcointalk.org and has been interviewed on bitcoin by Russia Today. He operates the Bitcoin Laundry, a service which allows users to exchange their bitcoins for other bitcoins which have a different transaction history.

Background Marisela Escobedo Ortiz's social activism began in 2008 in Ciudad Juárez following the murder of her 16-year-old daughter Ruby Frayre. Marisela Escobedo and her husband claimed that their daughter was allegedly murdered by Sergio Rafael Barraza Bocanegra. They managed to locate Barraza in Fresnillo, Zacatecas, where he was arrested and taken to Juarez where he confessed to the crime in court and told of the burial of the remains of Ruby. Barraza was however acquitted by judges for lack of evidence and was released, thereby generating a scandal that became known nationally and internationally. In response, Marisela Escobedo began a series of protests against the resolution against Chihuahua state authorities, asking for Barraza to be arrested and tried again, appealing the decision. A circuit court overturned the acquittal and Barraza was sentenced for murder, while Barraza remained a fugitive from justice. After numerous representations to the governors Jose Reyes Baeza Terrazas and Cesar Duarte Jáquez, they moved their protest to the Plaza Hidalgo in the city of Chihuahua in front of the Government Palace, the home of the governor, where on 16 December 2010 Marisela was killed by an unknown assassin by a single shot to the head.

Mark Clifford is a British musician and producer known primarily for his involvement with his band Seefeel. He has been involved in a number of solo and collaborative projects which have resulted in a wide range of material released on many different labels including Warp Records, Rephlex Records, Bella Union, Editions Mego and his own Polyfusia label. Seefeel Seefeel was formed in 1992: Clifford advertising in local classifieds for members. In its earliest incarnation Sarah Peacock, Justin Fletcher and Mark Van Hoen represented guitar/vocals, drums and bass respectively, with Daren Seymour supplanting Van Hoen as the bassist early on. Too Pure signed Seefeel and published their first EPs and LP in 1993. Seefeel decamped to Warp Records in 1994 where they remain signed to this day, having released two LPs and three EPs with them thus far. 1996 also saw the release of a mini album, (CH-VOX) on Rephlex Records. Around 1999 Seefeel went on an indefinite hiatus only to reconvene in 2008 with a new Bassist and drummer, Shigeru Ishihara and Iida Kazuhisa. Solo projects Aside from his work with Seefeel, Clifford has released two mini albums, 1995's Looking for Snags & 1996's Clean, Pit and Lid, under the name Disjecta for Warp Records. The name of the project was taken from the literature of Samuel Beckett. A 4 track Disjecta EP, True Love by Normal, was also released in 2003 on Clifford's own Polyfusia label. 1996 also saw the release of a 4 track vinyl-only EP titled Souff Souff on Warp under the guise of Woodenspoon. Clifford has produced and remixed a number of different artists including Autechre (as Seefeel), Nav Katze (as Seefeel & Disjecta), Mira Calix, Bowery Electric and School of Seven Bells (as Seefeel). Work With Cocteau Twins Clifford, being an admirer of Scottish band Cocteau Twins, sent a copy of Seefeel's debut EP, More Like Space, to them in 1994 as a gesture not expecting it to incite anything in particular. To his surprise the band loved it and contacted him requesting he collaborate with them on a new EP of remixes. The result of this collaborative project was 1995's Otherness consisting of four remixed tracks. Clifford would also tour with the band in 1996, performing live remixes on stage as well as DJing. Other collaborative projects Following the initial dissolution of Seefeel Clifford formed a collaborative project called Sneakster with vocalist Sophie Hinkley. They released two EPs and an LP in 1999 on Robin Guthrie's label Bella Union. Periodically between 1999 and 2004 Clifford met with friend and collaborator Mira Calix to record material. A retrospective of this material titled Lost Foundling was released in 2010 on Andrea Parker (DJ)'s label Aperture. Clifford has released a collaborative album with Simon Kealoha (Calika) and a split EP with Zavoloka, both on his Polyfusia label. Mark Clifford also works with musician Scott Douglas Gordon (Loops Haunt) under the project title Oto Hiax. Their first, self-titled album, was released by Editions Mego in 2017 References Category:British guitarists Category:British male guitarists Category:Living people Category:Warp (record label) artists Category:British electronic musicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mark Clifford"},{"id":"35814685","text":"\\"Soerabaja\\" (Perfected Spelling \\"Surabaya\\", also known by the intermediary form \\"Surabaja\\") is a work of fiction by Indonesian writer Idrus variously described as a novel, novelette, and long short story. It was published in 1946 or 1947. Background \\"Surabaya\\" was written by Idrus (1921–1979), a Minangkabau writer from Padang, West Sumatra, Dutch East Indies. Idrus began his career in literature as an editor at Balai Pustaka, the official publisher of the Dutch colonial government, in 1943. In this period he began writing short stories. Idrus' first short stories, such as \\"Ave Maria\\", showed hints of romanticism; by the time wrote \\"Surabaya\\", however, he had become jaded with the realities of life. He had been a witness to several of the events which later became part of his work. Plot \\"Surabaya\\" is told in fragments, with no single main character. The story begins with a group of Indos raising the Dutch flag over the city over Surabaya after the Japanese – who had invaded in 1942 – surrendered. The flag is taken down by pro-nationalist native Indonesians and replaced with the flag of the newly-proclaimed country. Later, the Allied forces land in the city. After the native troops ignore an ultimatum to surrender their weapons, a battle breaks out, culminating with the bombing of Surabaya on 10 November 1945. Indonesian civilians leave the city, heading for nearby Krian and Sidoarjo. They are highly suspicious and kill anyone accused of being a spy. In the large groups of evacuees, the men and women become prone to fornication. Meanwhile, young soldiers in Surabaya fight to retain the city but quickly become depressed because of their lack of weapons and supplies. The story ends in May 1946. Style \\"Surabaya\\" has been described as a satire by several writers, including the literary documentarian HB Jassin, and the Indonesian writer and literary critic M. Balfas; Balfas describes it as \\"perhaps the only satire of the National Revolution.\\" It is written in short bursts of plots, similar to Idrus' earlier \\"Corat-Coret di Bawah Tanah\\" (\\"Underground Markings\\"); Jassin described the narrative technique as being kaleidoscopic, while he called the writer's use of language full of meaning and the leaps between story lines agile. The Indonesian writer and literary critic M. Balfas writes that \\"Surabaya\\" was one of the works in which Idrus' signature style of realism known as The New Simplicity (), is most evident. Unlike his contemporaries, who wrote joyously of Indonesia's chances for self-governance, Idrus showed a sense of doubt and disapproval in the story, as well as cynicism. Although in his earlier works his negative depictions were generally limited to foreigners and persons of foreign descent, in \\"Surabaya\\" he targeted Indonesians as well. He referred to the revolutionaries as \\"cowboys\\" (\\"\\"), the Allies as \\"bandits\\" (\\"\\"), and the hair of revolutionary leader Sutomo smelling of a wet pillow that had never been dried. Balfas writes that Idrus was most cynical in \\"Surabaya\\". Themes The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw sees the work as showing humanity's capability to show cruelty to other humans, as well as advocating that one should not rush into war. Release and reception \\"Surabaya\\" was published by Merdeka Press in 1946 or 1947. In 1948, it was included in a collection of short stories written by Idrus, entitled Dari Ave Maria ke Jalan Lain ke Roma (From Ave Maria to Another Way to Rome), published by Balai Pustaka. \\"Surabaya\\" was poorly received at the time of its publication; Idrus was cast aside by mainstream writers, who did not view the work as satire and instead branded him a counterrevolutionary. Satires were not published again in Indonesia until after the revolution, when writers such as Mochtar Lubis, Utuy Sontani, and Prijana Winduwinata – upset over the political leadership's perceived unwillingness to fulfill their promises – began using the technique again. Idrus's later works became more introspective, with less cynicism and sarcasm. The work was translated by the American scholar of Indonesian literature Harry Aveling and included in From Surabaya to Armageddon: Indonesian Short Stories, published in 1976. In a review of the translation, Nigel Phillips wrote that the work \\"read[s] very well and [has an] idiomatic ring\\" but had numerous mistranslations.

The film dealt with the promiscuity of male migrant workers to urban India, and also the sexuality of women, left behind in the rural regions. Hema Malini received a nomination for the Filmfare Best Actress Award for her role in the film. Plot The story is set in a remote village in Gujarat. Menfolk here, like in many other villages across India go to the cities to work, leaving behind their families. Mansukh (Naseeruddin Shah) after working for a long time in Dubai, returns to his native village. This is the village where all the men have gone to work in the cities. The lonely women of the village are all excited with the arrival of Mansukh and many are after him. Especially Sukhi (Neena Gupta) and Reema Lagoo. Taku (Hema Malini), wife of Amarji (Vinod Khanna) is a woman with an attitude. She is an independent and strong woman, who is different from the group. Mansukh becomes interested in her and he goes after her. After his persistent attempts he succeeds and they start having a relationship. After a while, Mansukh leaves the village. The women Sukhi and Taku later find out that they are both pregnant. How they deal with their pregnancies is the subject of the movie. This is a staggering movie that shakes some of the fundamental rules of Indian society. It talks about equal opportunity to females in all aspects. The movie starts with the introduction of the village characters through a postman (Harish Patel). Later, the movie targeting the men folk on their attitude towards women, hooks them with a common man's dream story. A man in a village filled with longing women. Then it slowly turns and develops through various threads to tell how women is differentiated in the eyes of the society, what a baby means to a woman and what is real manliness. Jhumkhu (Ila arun) for example, loses her son in a fire accident and is forced to do the funeral without her husband, as he is not able to come to the village. She goes through that trauma all alone. She almost becomes insane on that loss, this character is later used to convey the message that whether it is an accident or an abortion, the trauma of losing a child for a woman is the same. Like Jhumku, there is a story behind every female character, and they have one problem or the other because of the fact that they are women. The movie puts the double standard followed for men and women through various village characters. Mansukh's father in the panchayat blames the women of the village to be punished, without saying anything about his son who was responsible for everything. The movie also points out the hypocrisy of the society which says it is okay to hide the truth rather than reveal it openly. Cast * Vinod Khanna... Amar Ji * Hema Malini... Taku * Naseeruddin Shah...

Below are the recent massacres that have occurred in several parts of Mexico between Los Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel, who fight to take over each other's territories. The killings are the latest \\"salvo in a gruesome game of tit-for-tat in fighting\\" among Mexican drug cartels. =2011–2012 Veracruz massacres= The recent tit-for-tat fighting between Los Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel started in the fall in Veracruz, a strategic smuggling state with a giant gulf port. On 20 September 2011, two trucks containing 35 dead bodies were found at an underpass near a shopping mall in Boca del Río, Veracruz. All of the corpses were alleged to be members of Los Zetas, but it was later proven that only six of them had been involved in minor crime incidents, and none of them were involved with organized crime. Some of the victims had their hands tied and showed signs of having been tortured. According to El Universal, at around 17:00 hours an undetermined number of vehicles blocked a major avenue in Boca del Río. Once the traffic stopped, armed men abandoned two trucks in the middle of the highway. They opened the doors of the trucks and pulled out the thirty-five corpses, leaving a written message behind. Other gunmen pointed their weapons at the frightened drivers. The cartel members then fled the scene. The Blog del Narco reported on 21 September 2011 that the message was supposedly signed by Gente Nueva, an enforcer group that works for Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the top boss of the Sinaloa cartel. Nonetheless, on 27 September 2011, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel released a video claiming they had carried out these attacks against Los Zetas, and that they were planning to take over Veracruz. On 6 October 2011 in Boca del Río, Veracruz, 36 bodies were found by the Mexican authorities in three different houses. The Mexican Navy first discovered 20 bodies inside a house in a residential neighborhood. While searching at another house they found 11 more bodies. The third and final house contained one body. Four other bodies were confirmed separately by the state government of Veracruz. A day later, Reynaldo Escobar Pérez, the State Justice Attorney General, stepped down and resigned due to the drug- violence. And a day after his resignation, 10 more bodies were found throughout the city of Veracruz. The Jalisco New Generation Cartel was also responsible for 67 killings in Veracruz on 7 October 2011. On 11 June 2012 in the municipality of Álamo, Veracruz, 14 dismembered bodies were abandoned inside a Nissan truck on a highway near the border with Tamaulipas. Alerted by an anonymous call, the bodies were found on 8:00 p.m. on June 11, but the authorities finished picking them up at around 7:00 a.m. the next day. Security measures increased in the area after the gruesome discovery. =2011–2012 Sinaloa massacres= As a response for the killings in Veracruz, Los Zetas carried out an incursion to the state of Sinaloa on 23 November 2011 and left 26 bodies — 16 of them burned to death — in several abandoned vehicles in Sinaloa. The incident began at early hours of the morning in Culiacán, Sinaloa with the discovery of a vehicle on fire. When the police forces managed to put down the flames, they found inside the vehicle a dozen of bodies burned to death, and with wood remains on top of them. All of the victims were handcuffed. Later on at 07:00 hours, anonymous calls from civilians notified the police that another vehicle in the northern city limits of Culiacán was on fire. The vehicle on fire was a Ford Ranger, and inside were four bodies with bulletproof vests and handcuffed. During the night, 10 more bodies were found throughout several different municipalities. Again in the state of Sinaloa on 5 June 2012, the bodies of 7 men were dumped on a street in Culiacán inside thirteen plastic bags. Initially, the Mexican authorities believed that the victims were police officers because they were wearing similar clothing to those of a special operations unit. Nonetheless, they concluded that the uniforms were not from any police agency. A message was left behind by the killers, blaming the Mexican authorities of cooperating with the Sinaloa cartel's drug boss, Joaquín Guzmán Loera, nicknamed El Chapo. The banner accused President Felipe Calderón and the state authorities for protecting the Sinaloa Cartel. Claims like this are not new to the city of Culiacán; back in 2010 and 2011, banners were put up claiming the state government and police forces protected the Sinaloa cartel. Nonetheless, none of the previous cases involved leaving dead bodies along with the messages, which suggest that the killers are looking to attract more attention of a possible cartel-government collusion. =2011–2012 Jalisco massacres= 2011 Guadalajara massacre As a response for the Sinaloa cartel incursions, Los Zetas carried out a massacre as a response for the killings done by the Matazetas against them in the state of Veracruz. On 24 November 2011, three trucks containing 26 bodies were found in an avenue at Guadalajara, Jalisco. All of them were male corpses. At around 7:00 pm, the police station in Guadalajara received numerous anonymous calls from civilians reporting that \\"several vehicles with more than 10 bodies had been abandoned\\" in a major avenue. Upon the arrival of the police forces, they found a green Dodge Caravan in the middle lane of the highway, along with a Nissan Caravan just 66 feet (20 meters) away; on the farthest right lane was a white Van. Reports mention that Los Zetas and the Milenio Cartel are responsible for the massacre of these twenty-six alleged Sinaloa Cartel members. 2012 Chapala massacre As a response for the 2012 Nuevo Laredo massacres, Los Zetas responded with another massacre of its own. They left the chopped-up remains of 18 bodies inside a Toyota Sienna and Ford EcoSport near the U.S. retiree communities in Chapala, Jalisco, just south of the city of Guadalajara. Eighteen heads were found along the dismembered bodies; some had been frozen, others were covered in lime, and the rest were found in an advance state of decomposition. An anonymous call alerted the police to the abandoned vehicles, which were found by the side of a highway early in the morning on 9 May 2012. They were consequently towed to government offices to unload the bodies. The Mexican authorities confirmed that a message was left behind by the killers, presumably from Los Zetas and the Milenio Cartel. =2011–2012 Tamaulipas massacres= 2011 San Fernando massacre The 2011 San Fernando massacre was the mass murder of 193 people by Los Zetas drug cartel at La Joya ranch in the municipality of San Fernando, Tamaulipas, Mexico. Authorities investigating the massacre reported numerous hijackings of passenger buses on Mexican Federal Highway 101 in San Fernando, and the kidnapped victims were later killed and buried in 47 clandestine mass graves. The investigations began immediately after several suitcases and baggage were unclaimed in Reynosa and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. On 6 April 2011, the Mexican authorities exhumed 59 corpses from eight mass graves; by 7 June 2011, and after a series of multiple excavations, 193 bodies were exhumed from the mass graves in San Fernando. 2012 Nuevo Laredo massacres Dismembered remains of 14 men were found in several plastic bags inside a Chrysler Voyager in the border city of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas on 17 April 2012. All of those killed were between the ages of 30 and 35. Mexican officials stated that they found a \\"message signed by a criminal group,\\" but they did not release the content of the note, nor if those killed were members of Los Zetas or of the Gulf Cartel. CNNMéxico stated that the message left behind by the criminal group said that they were going to \\"clean up Nuevo Laredo\\" by killing Zeta members. The Monitor newspaper, however, said that a source outside law enforcement but with direct knowledge of the attacks stated the 14 bodies belonged to members of Los Zetas who had been killed by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, now a branch of the Sinaloa Cartel. Following the attacks, the Sinaloa cartel's kingpin, Joaquín Guzmán Loera—better known as El Chapo Guzmán—sent a message to Los Zetas that they will fight for the control of the Nuevo Laredo plaza. 23 bodies—14 of them decapitated and 9 of them hanged from a bridge—were discovered in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, in an escalation of brutal violence involving rival drug gangs on the U.S. border. In the first incident, at around 1:00 am on 4 May 2012, nine people were hanged from a bridge on the Mexican Federal Highway 85D with a message left behind by the killers. Horrified motorists encountered the blood-stained bodies of four women and five men hanging off a bridge. The banner left behind reportedly stated that those killed were the perpetrators of the car bomb in the city on 24 April 2012. In addition, the 9 people who were hanged on the bridge were reportedly members of the Gulf Cartel who were killed by Los Zetas for \\"heating up\\" their turf. In the second incident, which occurred hours later, 14 decapitated bodies were abandoned inside a vehicle in front of the Customs Agency; the severed heads were left inside several ice coolers in front of the municipal palace. The Mexican police said the second massacre could have been an act of revenge by the Gulf Cartel to Los Zetas for the earlier killings. Along with the decapitated bodies was a message allegedly signed by Joaquín Guzmán Loera, where he demanded the municipality mayor of Nuevo Laredo, Benjamín Galván, along with other municipal and state leaders and public safety officials to recognize the Sinaloa cartel's presence in the area and stop insisting he is not in the city.  2012 Ciudad Mante massacres In the afternoon of 7 June 2012 just outside city hall of Ciudad Mante, Tamaulipas, 14 mutilated bodies were discovered inside a parked truck. Investigators stated that the bodies were of 11 men and 3 women. The bodies are accompanied by a banner taking credit for the killings. Although unconfirmed, according to the Proceso magazine, the banner was signed by the Sinaloa Cartel and directed to Los Zetas, an organized crime group that currently controls the drug trafficking corridor of Ciudad Mante. Milenio confirmed that the Gulf Cartel had killed the 14 people, allegedly members of Los Zetas, as retaliation for the grenade attacks they had carried out in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, the headquarters of the Gulf cartel. The Blog del Narco uploaded a video on their website from an anonymous cameraman who filmed the truck and the fourteen corpses. In response to the Gulf cartel attacks, Los Zetas responded in their kind, leaving 14 mutilated bodies inside an abandoned bus on a parking lot of a shopping center in Ciudad Mante. The bodies of ten men and four women, which were reported at around 9 a.m. on 23 June 2012, were left behind along with a banner directed to the Gulf cartel. Its message, however, was not revealed by the Mexican authorities. This gruesome discovery happened a day after several grenade attacks in the capital city of Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, where eight people were injured. Ciudad Mante is a sugar-cane growing community with a population of near 110,000 people, located just 250 miles south from Texas. =2011–2012 Nuevo León massacres= 2012 Apodaca prison riot On 19 February 2012 at a prison in Apodaca, Nuevo León, Mexico, at least 44 people were killed, with another twelve injured. The Blog del Narco, a blog that documents events and people of the Mexican drug war anonymously, reported that the actual (unofficial) death toll may be more than 70 people. The fight was between Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel, two drug cartels that operate in northeastern Mexico. The governor of Nuevo León, Rodrigo Medina, mentioned on 20 February 2012 that 30 inmates escaped from the prison during the riot. Four days later, however, the new figures of the fugitives went down to 29. On 16 March 2012, the Attorney General's Office of Nuevo León confirmed that 37 prisoners had actually escaped on the day of the massacre. One of the fugitives, Óscar Manuel Bernal alias La Araña (The Spider), is considered by the Mexican authorities to be \\"extremely dangerous,\\" and is believed to be the leader of Los Zetas in the municipality of Monterrey. Some other fugitives were also leaders in the organization. 2012 Cadereyta Jiménez massacre On 13 May 2012 on the Mexican Federal Highway 40 in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, 49 people were decapitated and mutilated by members of Los Zetas drug cartel and dumped by a roadside near the city of Monterrey in northern Mexico. The bodies were found in the town of San Juan in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León, at about 4 a.m. on a non-toll highway leading to Reynosa, Tamaulipas. The forty-three men and six women killed had their heads, feet, and hands cut off, making their identification difficult. Those killed also bore signs of torture and were stuffed in plastic bags. Four days before this incident, 18 people were found decapitated and dismembered near Mexico's second largest city, Guadalajara. The discovery seems to echo several other mass murder events where the drug cartels have left large numbers of bodies in public places as warnings to their rivals. The authorities have blamed much of the violence on Los Zetas – a cartel originally set up by ex-commandos that deserted the Mexican Army in the 1990s – and the Sinaloa Cartel, an organization headed by Joaquín Guzmán Loera (a.k.a. El Chapo), Mexico's most- wanted drug lord.

The Woiwurrung people's territory in Central Victoria extended from north of the Great Dividing Range, east to Mount Baw Baw, south to Mordialloc Creek and to Mount Macedon, Sunbury and Gisborne in the west. Their lands bordered the Gunai/Kurnai people to the east in Gippsland, the Boon wurrung people to the south on the Mornington Peninsula, and the Dja Dja Wurrung and Taungurong to the north. Before colonisation, they lived predominantly as aquaculturists, swidden agriculturists (growing grasslands by fire-stick farming to create fenceless herbivore grazing, garden-farming murnong yam roots and various tuber lilies as major forms of starch and carbohydrates), and hunters and gatherers. Seasonal changes in the weather, availability of foods and other factors would determine where campsites were located, many near the Birrarung and its tributaries. Each of the various Woiwurrung tribes had its own distinct territory and boundary usually determined by waterways. The clans included: * The Wurrundjeri-Willam, who occupied the Yarra River and its tributaries and inhabited the area now covered by the city of Melbourne. Referred to initially by Europeans as the Yarra tribe. * The Marin-Bulluk * The Kurung Jang Balluk * The Wurundjeri Balluk * The Balluk Willam * The Gunung Willam Balluk * The Talling Willam The term Wurundjeri has become one of the common terms used today for descendants of all the Woiwurrung tribes, as they were forced together for the survival of their ethnic group. Their totems are Bunjil the eagle and Waa the crow. History =Pre-history= Prehistory of Australia—The Shoreline of Tasmania and Victoria connected by land bridge about 14,000 years ago, showing some of the human archaeological sites Wurundjeri is a common recent name for people who have lived in the Woiwurrung area for up to 40,000 years, according to Gary Presland. They lived by fishing, hunting and gathering, and made a good living from the rich food sources of Port Phillip both before and after its flooding about 7,000–10,000 years ago, and the surrounding grasslands. At the Keilor Archaeological Site a human hearth excavated in 1971 was radiocarbon-dated to about 31,000 years BP, making Keilor one of the earliest sites of human habitation in Australia. A cranium found at the site has been dated at between 12,000 and 14,700 years BP. Archaeological sites in Tasmania and on the Bass Strait Islands have been dated to between 20,000 – 35,000 years ago, when sea levels were 130 metres below present level allowing Aboriginal people to move across the region of southern Victoria and on to the land bridge of the Bassian plain to Tasmania by at least 35,000 years ago. During the Ice Age about 20,000 years BP, the area now known as Port Phillip would have been dry land, and the Yarra and Werribee river would have joined to flow through the heads then south and south west through the Bassian plain before meeting the ocean to the west. Tasmania and the Bass Strait islands became separated from mainland Australia around 12,000 BP, when the sea level was approximately 50m below present levels. Port Phillip was flooded by post-glacial rising sea levels between 8,000 and 6,000 years ago. Oral history and creation stories from the Wathaurong, Woiwurrung and Boon wurrung languages describe the flooding of the bay. Hobsons Bay was once a kangaroo hunting ground. Creation stories describe how Bunjil was responsible for the formation of the bay, or the bay was flooded when the Yarra river was created (Yarra Creation Story). =First contact with non-Aboriginal peoples= Sewn and incised possum-skin cloak of Wurundjeri origin (Melbourne Museum) The Woiwurrung tribes would have been aware of the Europeans, through the close relationship to the Boon wurrung people of the coast who came into contact with the Baudin expedition on the French ship Naturaliste during 1801, and then the British settlement at Sullivan Bay in 1803, near modern-day Sorrento, Victoria. William Buckley, a convict, escaped from this abortive settlement and lived for more than 30 years with the Wathaurong people before approaching John Batman's party in 1835. He told George Langhorne in 1836: > I frequently entertained them (the Wada wurrung), when sitting around the > campfires, with accounts of the English People, Houses, Ships – great guns > etc. to which accounts they would listen with great attention – and express > much astonishment. The Boon wurrung people, living primarily along the Port Philip and Western Port coast, were also subjected to raids on their camps by sealers from at least 1809 to as late as 1833, which were frequently violent with men being killed and the women being abducted and enslaved by sealers for sexual partners and taken to the Islands in Bass Strait where the sealers had their camps. This would have impacted the economic and social ties binding the Woiwurrung and Boon wurrung peoples. James Fleming, one of the party of Charles Grimes in HMS Cumberland who explored the Maribyrnong River and the Yarra River as far as Dights Falls in February 1803 reported smallpox scars on several Aboriginal people he met, indicating that a smallpox epidemic had swept through the tribes around Port Philip before 1803 reducing the population. Broome puts forward that two epidemics of smallpox almost annihilated the Kulin tribes by perhaps killing half each time in the 1790s and again around 1830. The Wurundjeri incorporated these epidemics in their oral tradition as the Mindi, a rainbow serpent from the Northwest sent to destroy or afflict any people for bad deeds, hissing and spreading white particles from its mouth from which disease could be inhaled. > Any plague is supposed to be brought on by the Mindye or some of its little > ones. I have no doubt that, in generations gone by, there has been an awful > plague of cholera or black fever, and that the wind at the time, or some > other appearance from the north-west has given rise to this strange being. =Treaty= 1880s Artist impression of Batman's Treaty being signed On 6 June 1835 John Batman met with eight elders of the Woiwurrung people including Bebejan and Billibellary, the traditional owners of the lands around the Yarra River. The meeting took place on the bank of a small stream, likely to be the Merri Creek and treaty documents were signed along with exchanges of goods by both sides. For a purchase price including tomahawks, knives, scissors, flannel jackets, red shirts and a yearly tribute of similar items, Batman obtained about around the Yarra River and Corio Bay. The total value of the goods has been estimated at about £100 in the value of the day. In return the Woiwurrung offered woven baskets of examples of their weaponry and two Possum- skin cloaks, a highly treasured item. After the treaty signing, a celebration took place with the Parramatta Aborigines with Batman's party dancing a corroboree. The treaty was significant as it was the first and only documented time when European settlers negotiated their presence and occupation of Aboriginal lands. The Treaty was immediately repudiated by the colonial government in Sydney. The 1835 proclamation by Governor Richard Bourke implemented the doctrine of terra nullius upon which British settlement was based, reinforcing the concept that there was no land owner before British possession and that Aboriginal people could not sell or assign the land, and individuals could only acquire it through distribution by the Crown. =Dispossession and conflict= Wurundjeri near Collins Street, Melbourne, 1839. Watercolour by W. Knight Derrimut, an arweet of the Boon wurrung informed the early European settlers in October 1835 of an impending attack by \\"up-country people\\". The colonists armed themselves, and the attack was averted. Benbow from the Boon wurrung and Billibellary, from the Wurundjeri, also acted to protect the colonists in what is perceived as part of their duty of hospitality. In 1840, conflict erupted at the Battle of Yering, near present-day Yarra Glen, in which Border Police under the direction of Commissioner of Lands, Captain Henry Gisborne captured Wurundjeri leader Jaga Jaga, eliciting a violent confrontation involving 50 Wurundjeri clansmen where shots were exchanged. As early as 1843 Billibellary requested land for the Wurundjeri to settle. In August 1850 it is likely that the Woiwurrung requested land at Bulleen, but William Thomas, a Protector of Aborigines in Victoria, rejected their request as being too close to white settlement. In 1852 the Woiworrung gained 782 hectares along the Yarra at Warrandyte, while the Boon wurrung were allocated 340 hectares at Mordialloc Creek. These reserves were never staffed by whites and were not permanent camps, but acted as distribution depots where rations and blankets were distributed, with the intention being to keep the tribes away from the growing settlement of Melbourne. The Aboriginal Protection Board revoked these two reserves in 1862 and 1863, considering them then too close to Melbourne. =Social impact= Tullamareena escaping from a Melbourne gaol around 1838 The Woiwurrung and Boon wurrong people bore the brunt of the effects of British settlement in the Foundation of Melbourne from 1835 onwards, with the population declining rapidly. In the 27 years following the foundation of Melbourne, the population of Woiworung and Boon wurrung language groups was reduced from 207 to 28 people. Many people were killed by diseases, including venereal disease, introduced by the Europeans. The birth rate also drastically declined for Woiwurrung and Boon wurrung with only five births between 1838 and 1848, while there were 52 deaths for the same period. William Thomas remarked in 1844 that \\"Infanticide I am persuaded is most awfully on the increase though it cannot be detected—their argument has some reason 'No good pickaninnys now no country'\\". =Native Police Corps= On the instructions of Charles La Trobe a Native Police Corps was established and underwritten by the government in 1842 in the hope of civilising the Aboriginal men. It was based at Narre Warren, but later moved to Merri Creek and continued in operation until disbanded in January 1853. As senior Wurundjeri elder, Billibellary's cooperation for the proposal was important for its success, and after deliberation he backed the initiative and even proposed himself for enlistment, but resigned after about a year when he found that it was to be used to capture and even kill other natives. He did his best from then to undermine the Corps and as a result many native troopers deserted and few remained longer than three or four years. Participation in the police corps failed to stop troopers participating in tribal ceremonies, gatherings and rituals. =Coranderrk= In 1863 the surviving members of the Woiwurrung tribes and speakers were given \\"permissive occupancy\\" of Coranderrk Station, near Healesville and forcibly resettled. Despite numerous petitions, letters, and delegations to the Colonial and Federal Government, the grant of this land in compensation for the country lost was refused. Coranderrk was closed in 1924 and its occupants bar five refusing to leave Country were again moved to Lake Tyers in Gippsland. Structure, borders and land use A basic map of the Woiwurrung language group in the context of other Kulin nations Communities consisted of six or more (depending on the extent of the territory) land-owning groups called clans that spoke a related language and were connected through cultural and mutual interests, totems, trading initiatives and marriage ties. Access to land and resources, such as the Birrarung, by other clans, was sometimes restricted depending on the state of the resource in question. For example; if a river or creek had been fished regularly throughout the fishing season and fish supplies were down, fishing was limited or stopped entirely by the clan who owned that resource until fish were given a chance to recover. During this time other resources were utilised for food. This ensured the sustained use of the resources available to them. As with most other Kulin territories, penalties such as spearings were enforced upon trespassers. Today, traditional clan locations, language groups and borders are no longer in use and descendants of Woiwurrung Tribes including the Wurundjeri tribe people live within modern day society. =Tribes / Clans= It is generally considered that before European settlement, six separate clans existed: * Wurundjeri- balluk & Wurundjeri-willam: Yarra Valley, Yarra River catchment area to Heidelberg * Bulluk-willam: south of the Yarra Valley extending down to Dandenong, Cranbourne, Koo-wee-rup Swamp * Gunnung-willam-balluk: east of the Great Dividing Ranges and north to Lancefield * Kurung-jang-balluk: Melton to Werribee River to Sunbury * Marin-balluk (Boi-berrit): land west of the Maribyrnong River, Sunshine and Sunbury * Kurnaje-berreing: the land between the Maribyrnong and Yarra Rivers =Diplomacy= When foreign people passed through or were invited onto Woiwurrung lands the ceremony of Tanderrum – freedom of the bush – would be performed. This allowed safe passage and temporary access and use of land and resources by foreign people. It was a diplomatic rite involving the landholder's hospitality and a ritual exchange of gifts. Language The Wurundjeri people were part of the Woiwurrung language group; each clan spoke a slight variation of the Woiwurrung language. Some basic terms include; * bulluk, balluk: swamp * Nira: cave * willam, wilam, Illam, yilam: hut, camp, bark * gunung, gunnung: river * ngamudji: red colours during sunset, white man * The Jindyworobak Movement claim to have taken their name from a Woiwurrung phrase jindi worobak meaning to annex or join. Religion The Woiwurrung people shared the same belief system as other Kulin nation territories, based on a creative epoch known as the Dreamtime which stretches back into a remote era in history when the creator ancestors known as the First Peoples travelled across the land, creating and naming as they went. Indigenous Australia's oral tradition and religious values are based upon reverence for the land and a belief in this Dreamtime. The Dreaming is at once both the ancient time of creation and the present day reality of Dreaming. There were a great many different groups, each with their own individual culture, belief structure, and language. These cultures overlapped to a greater or lesser extent, and evolved over time. The two moiety totems of the Woiwurrung people are Bunjil the Eaglehawk and Waang the Crow. =Dreamtime stories= * Bunjil & Pallian Creation Story: Bunjil is the Creator spirit of the Kulin People. * Birrarung Creation Story: formation of the Birrarung River. * Mindi: Mindi is a rainbow serpent from the northwest who spreads disease to those who have been bad, but cannot act without Bunjil's permission. Recreation William Thomas witnessed Woiwurrung people playing the game of Marn grook in 1841, according to Robert Brough-Smyth, in The Aborigines of Victoria, (1878): > The men and boys joyfully assemble when this game is to be played. One makes > a ball of possum skin, somewhat elastic, but firm and strong. The players of > this game do not throw the ball as a white man might do, but drop it and at > the same time kicks it with his foot. The tallest men have the best chances > in this game. Some of them will leap as high as five feet from the ground to > catch the ball. The person who secures the ball kicks it. This continues for > hours and the natives never seem to tire of the exercise. The game was a favourite of the Woiwurrung clans and two teams were sometimes based on the traditional totemic moeties of Bunjil (eagle) and Waang (crow) of the Kulin people. Robert Brough-Smyth saw the game played at Coranderrk Mission Station, where ngurungaeta William Barak discouraged the playing of imported games like cricket and encouraged the traditional native game of marn grook. There is some debate about whether the game influenced or was the origin of Australian Rules Football. As late as 1862 the Woiwurrung Aboriginal people were \\"often seen in their possum skin coats, armed with spears, and retreating mainly to the unsold hill north of Collingwood where they camped with their dogs, played football with a possum-skin ball and fought with other Aborigines\\", according to researchers McFarlane and Roberts, reported on in the Herald Sun. Places of significance Bolin Bolin Billabong in Bulleen, a reach in the river cut off around 1100AD Scarred tree in Fitzroy Gardens, the scar is left after a canoe has been cut out of the trunk There are a number of significant sites, in particular those found near the Yarra & Maribyrnong Rivers and the Merri Creek where corroborees were held between clans and perhaps neighbouring territories to share in music and dance, exchange news and trade. Other places of significance for the Wurundjeri people include: * Kings domain Resting Place: In 1985 the remains of 38 Victorian Aboriginal people held by the Museum Victoria, including Woiwurrung people, were reburied here. * Queen Victoria Market: burial site for many Aboriginal people as well as European settlers. * Corner Franklin and Bowen streets: First public executions took place in Melbourne on 20 January 1842, of two Tasmanian Aborigines: Tunnerminnerwait and Maulboyheenner, who had conducted a successful guerilla style resistance campaign around Western Port. * Jolimont: gatherings of Kulin territories around the site of the MCG and Yarra Park.

It was named by the English anatomist and paleontologist Thomas Henry Huxley in 1871 as an order. Other names which were once considered equivalent to Protorosauria include Prolacertiformes and Prolacertilia. Protorosaurs are distinguished by their long necks formed by elongated cervical vertebrae, which have ribs that extend backward to the vertebrae behind them. Protorosaurs also have a gap between the quadrate bones and the jugal bones in the back of the skull near the jaw joint, making their skulls resemble those of lizards. Classification Protorosauria was considered to be a synonym of Prolacertiformes for many years. Since 1998, many phylogenetic analyses have found Protorosauria, as used in its widest sense, to be a polyphyletic or paraphyletic taxon. Protorosaurus, Macrocnemus, tanystropheids, and various other protorosaurs are usually placed near the base of Archosauromorpha, while Prolacerta and Pamelaria, two Gondwanan Triassic protorosaurs, are now thought to be in a more derived position as close relatives of Archosauriformes. Most phylogenetic analyses since 1998 have found a strongly supported clade that includes only the genus Prolacerta and the Archosauriformes. For this reason Prolacerta, Pamelaria, and several other related forms (collectively called prolacertids) have been removed from Protorosauria. Because the name Prolacertiformes is defined based on the genus Prolacerta, the name Protorosauria is used for the remaining group. Only recently has Protorosauria been defined in a phylogenetic sense as the most inclusive clade containing taxa such as Protorosaurus, Macrocnemus, and Tanystropheus. Analyses, such as Dilkes (1998), Sues (2003), Modesto & Sues (2004), Rieppel, Fraser & Nosotti (2003), Rieppel, Li & Fraser (2008), Gottmann-Quesada and Sander (2009) and Renesto et al. (2010), recovered a large Protorosauria, that includes Protorosaurus, Drepanosauridae (and relatives) and Tanystropheidae (and relatives). However, some analysis found Protorosaurus (and sometimes the closely related Czatkowiella) to be more advanced or more basal than the node Drepanosauridae+Tanystropheidae, but always more basal than Prolacerta. Some studies still use the term Prolacertiformes to include prolacertids and traditional protorosaurs, while restricting the term Protorosauria to the smallest clade that includes Protorosaurus, Macrocnemus, and Tanystropheus; thus Protorosauria is a true clade, while Prolacertiformes is an evolutionary grade of early archosauromorphs. Pritchard et al. (2015), Nesbitt et al. (2015), and Ezcurra (2016) found that even this definition of Protorosauria, like Prolacertiformes, was an unnatural group of various non-Crocopodan archosauromorphs. These studies found that tanystropheids were archosauromorphs more closely related to crocopods than to Protorosaurus. Nevertheless, Ezcurra noted that archosauromorph systematics required further study, and that phylogenetic support for Protorosauria being a natural group was only barely weaker than the support for the group being unnatural =Included groups= The Protorosauria includes the Permian genus Protorosaurus, closely related to Czatkowiella. A wide variety of Permian and Triassic reptiles have been classified within Protorosauria, including the arboreal gliding reptile Sharovipteryx and the aquatic tanystropheids, which have extremely long necks. Another enigmatic group of Triassic reptiles, the Drepanosauromorpha, have often been classified as belonging to the Protorosauria. Pterosaurs have also been proposed as protorosaurs or close relatives of them, although they are now regarded as a more derived group of archosaurs. While Senter (2004) reassigned the bizarre, arboreal drepanosaurids and Longisquama to a group of more primitive diapsids called Avicephala, subsequent studies failed to find the same result, instead supporting the hypothesis that they were protorosaurs.

The U.S.–Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement, officially titled Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the United States of America, is an agreement between Afghanistan and the United States of America that provides the long-term framework for the relationship between Afghanistan and the United States of America after the drawdown of U.S. forces in the Afghanistan war. The Strategic Partnership Agreement went into effect on July 4, 2012, as stated by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who said on July 8, 2012, at the Tokyo Conference on Afghanistan: \\"Like a number of countries represented here, the United States and Afghanistan signed a Strategic Partnership Agreement that went into effect four days ago.\\" Events leading up to the agreement In March and April 2012 the United States of America and Afghanistan reached two agreements which have been reported by several newspapers as progress regarding the framework for U.S. involvement in Afghanistan beyond 2014, when the last foreign combat troops are due to leave Afghanistan. First a memorandum of understanding to transfer control of the Parwan Detention Facility next to Bagram Airfield from the United States to Afghanistan was signed on March 9, 2012. According to Al Jazeera the agreement \\"will put an Afghan general in charge of Parwan [...] within days, [...] but will also give a six-month window to gradually transfer detainees to Afghan oversight. According to the document, the US will continue to provide logistical support for 12 months and a joint US–Afghan commission will decide on any detainee releases until a more permanent pact is adopted.\\" The memorandum of understanding shifts also the responsibility for all U.S. detention facilities in the country to Afghanistan. Second, the United States agreed to turn over the control of special operations to Afghan forces on April 8, 2012. Part of the agreement is to give Afghan military units greater control of controversial night raid operations unpopular with locals and to bring the raids under Afghan judicial authority, while American troops shift to a supporting role. The document was signed on 8 April 2012 by Afghan General Abdul Rahim Wardak and U.S. General John Allen. \\"Today we are one step closer to the establishment of the US–Afghan strategic partnership. Most importantly, today we are one step closer to our shared goal and vision of a secure and sovereign Afghanistan,\\" Allen said at the deal's signing. According to Al Jazeera the U.S.–Afghan strategic partnership \\"is expected to provide for several thousand US troops to stay and train Afghan forces and help with counter-terrorism operations. It would outline the legal status of those forces, their operating rules and where they would be based.\\" The Obama administration hoped to finalize the U.S.–Afghan strategic partnership before the 2012 NATO Summit in Chicago, but US efforts to finalize this partnership after one year of talks between the Afghanistan and American government were complicated by incidents involving the U.S. such as the burning of copies of the Quran and the death of 17 Afghans in southern Afghanistan.  Draft text  On April 22, 2012, after more than a year and a half of negotiations, Afghanistan and the United States finalized the draft text for the US Afghan strategic partnership, which will be reviewed by both countries' governments before it becomes final after the Afghan and American president sign it. The agreement named \\"Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement between Afghanistan and the United States\\" has a duration of at least 10 years, lays out the framework for a future U.S. role in Afghanistan, including aid assistance and governance advice, and covers the areas of social and economic development, institution building, regional cooperation and security. U.S. help to support Afghan economic development, health care programs, education and social initiatives are part of the agreement. The status of U.S. troops and the details of their operations after the 2014 withdrawal of NATO forces is not included in the partnership, but shall be covered in a separate status of forces agreement. Long-term US access to military bases in Afghanistan as well as the size or location of US bases in Afghanistan are also not part of the strategic partnership. According to Afghan Foreign Minister, Zalmai Rassoul, there will be no permanent US bases in Afghanistan. He told the Afghan Senate that the United States is \\"not interested in having military bases in Afghanistan which might be seen as a threat to our neighbors\\", but Afghan National Security Advisor Rangin Dadfar Spanta said before the Afghan parliament \\"After signing the strategic pact, a separate security agreement which will allow or not allow the existence of US permanent bases in Afghanistan will be signed after one year if agreed.\\" The strategic partnership draft text contains broad provisions for matters (such as economic development and security) which are of common concern for both countries, however, an unnamed U.S. official told Time magazine \\"specifics that go beyond the scope of the framework will need to be discussed and addressed in future memorandum of understanding, agreements or other arrangements as appropriate.\\" Obstacles on the way to the agreement of the draft text were the issues of night raids conducted by U.S. troops and the operation of detention facilities by the United States. The New York Times reported in this context in April 2012: \\"In March the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding shifting responsibility for all detention facilities in the country to the Afghans, and earlier this month they handed final authority for night raids to Afghan security forces, who are now carrying out all raids unless American assistance is requested. With those two issues resolved, the strategic partnership was quickly completed.\\"  Signing and content of agreement  On May 1, 2012 Afghan President Hamid Karzai and U.S. President Barack Obama signed the \\"Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the United States of America\\", after Obama arrived in Afghanistan as part of unannounced trip on the first anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death to sign the agreement, to visit American troops and to address the American nation from Bagram Air Base about his plans to responsibly end the war. The White House released a fact sheet to the agreement which stated that the agreement is a legally binding executive agreement the purpose of which is \\"to cement an enduring partnership with Afghanistan that strengthens Afghan sovereignty, stability and prosperity, and that contributes to our shared goal of defeating Al Qaeda and its extremist affiliates\\". The agreement shall help to promote NATO training of Afghan forces, a reconciliation and reintegration process for Taliban fighters who leave the battlefield, and regional stability with a focus on improving relations with Pakistan. The duration of the agreement is 10 years and requires from both parties to replace the current status of forces agreement with a bilateral security arrangement to be negotiated within a year. Covered areas under the agreement are military and security issues as well as assistance in building Afghanistan's economy and its democracy. One of the provisions of the agreement is the designation of Afghanistan as a major non-NATO ally of the United States to provide a long-term framework for security and defense cooperation. Other provisions of the agreement are: * The United States' commitment to support Afghanistan's social and economic development, security, institutions and regional cooperation for 10 years * The commitment by Afghanistan to strengthen government accountability, transparency and oversight, and to protect the human rights of all Afghans, both men and women * Access to and use of Afghan facilities by US personnel beyond 2014 * Granting the United States the possibility of keeping forces in Afghanistan after 2014 for purposes of training Afghan forces and targeting al-Qaida * Non-Commitment by the U.S. to any specific troop levels or funding levels in the future * Commitment by the U.S. to seek funding from the U.S. Congress on an annual basis for social and economic assistance for Afghanistan as well as to support the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) Reactions to the agreement President Karzai said that the agreement \\"will close the season of the past 10 years and is going to open an equal relationship season. With the signing of this agreement, we are starting a phase between two sovereign and independent countries that will be based on mutual respect, mutual commitments and mutual friendship\\". During a background briefing on the strategic partnership agreement by senior administration officials aboard Air Force One en route to Afghanistan, an unnamed U.S. official said: \\"This agreement will make clear to the Taliban, to al Qaeda, and to other international terrorist groups that they cannot wait us out. The agreement is not only a signal of long-term commitment by the United States, but a document that enshrines commitments by both countries to each other with a common purpose. Our commitments to support Afghanistan's social and economic development, security, institutions and regional cooperation is matched by Afghan commitments to strengthen accountability, transparency, oversight, and to protect the human rights of all Afghans, men and women.\\" Another U.S. official told The New York Times the agreement is necessary to give the United States the capacity to carry out counter-terrorism operations in order to prevent Al Qaeda's resettlement in Afghanistan and ensures \\"a regional equilibrium that serves our national security interest. And that's ultimately why we went in there in the first place.\\" According to The Christian Science Monitor, concerns have been raised about the agreement to end combat operations and withdraw troops earlier than previously planned, in particular regarding Afghanistan's security. The newspaper stated that anti-Afghanistan militants continue to carry out attacks on Western troops and that the Afghan military and police are not ready to assume responsibility for the country's security. Other concerns the Monitor noted include: a potential increase in illegal drug trafficking; negative impact on the economy and on social reforms, particularly those for women and destabilization of the country that could affect neighboring countries Pakistan and Iran. Concerns were also raised by Iran; following the announcement, a spokesman for Iran's foreign ministry stated that the agreement will lead to increased instability in Afghanistan due to the continued presence of U.S. forces. Investigative historian and journalist specializing in U.S. national security policy Gareth Porter said that neither the Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) nor the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding night raids will end the Afghanistan war nor the in Afghanistan unpopular night raids conducted by U.S. Special Operations Forces (SOF). The agreement received criticism from Republican members of Congress including Buck McKeon and James Inhofe. McKeon argued that the agreement did not provide anything new, and Inhofe, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called it \\"an attempt to shore up President Obama's national-security credentials\\". Conservatives including Inhofe and Heritage Foundation fellow James Carafano criticized the timing of the agreement and Obama's visit to Afghanistan, which they argue appears to have been related to his re-election campaign. However, they support the signing of the agreement to ensure the long term presence of U.S. forces in the country as necessary for its stabilization.  Further developments  = Designation as Major non-NATO ally = On 7 July 2012, as part of the Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement, the United States designated Afghanistan a major non- NATO ally after US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Kabul to meet with President Karzai. \\"Please know that the United States will be your friend,\\" Clinton told Karzai. \\"We are not even imagining abandoning Afghanistan. Quite the opposite. We are building a partnership with Afghanistan that will endure far into the future.\\" Afghanistan is the first country awarded the major non-NATO ally (MNNA) status by Barack Obama's administration. The change, which comes into effect immediately, makes it easier for Kabul to purchase US military equipment and simplifies arms export procedures. Clinton said: \\"There are a number of benefits that accrue to countries that have this designation. ... They are able to have access to excess defense supplies, for example, and they can be part of certain kinds of training and capacity building.\\" Some of the privileges of MNNA status include in addition eligibility for training, loans of equipment for cooperative research and development, and ultimately foreign military financing for commercial leasing of certain defense articles. \\"We see this as a powerful symbol of our commitment to Afghanistan's future,\\" Clinton said at a press conference after talks with President Hamid Karzai. \\"This is the kind of relationship that we think will be especially beneficial as we do the transition.\\" And she added: \\"It will open the door to Afghanistan's military to have a greater capability and a broader kind of relationship with the United States and especially the United States military.\\" The Times of India described the MNNA status in this context as \\"a catalyst for maintaining effective Afghan National Security Forces and building a robust peace-time security relationship between Afghanistan and the US.\\" The designation by the United States grants a country special privileges, like access to American military training and excess military supplies, Hillary Clinton said. In a separate statement, the State Department said Afghanistan would also be able to obtain loans of equipment from the United States and financing for leasing equipment. The agreement does not, however, \\"entail any security commitment\\" by the United States to Afghanistan, the State Department said Designating Afghanistan an ally, however, has the potential to raise awkward issues for the United States. There is Afghanistan's hot-and-cold relationship with Pakistan, also an ally, and the possibility the two neighbors could have a falling-out, especially if Afghan officials believe in the years after 2014 that their Pakistani counterparts continue to aid the Taliban. American and Afghan officials said after Afghanistan's designation as major non-NATO that they now must turn to working out, as mandated by the Strategic Partnership Agreement, a bilateral security arrangement that would keep a residual American force in Afghanistan to continue training Afghan National Security Forces and tracking down insurgents after 2014. Talks on the arrangement have not yet begun according to American officials. Estimates of the number of troops that could stay vary from as little as 10,000 to as many as 25,000 or 30,000. But Mrs. Clinton reiterated on 7 July 2012 that Washington did envision keeping American troops in Afghanistan, where they would provide the kind of air power and surveillance capabilities needed to give Afghan forces an edge over the Taliban. = Bilateral Security Agreement =  Events leading up to agreement on core elements  Under the strategic partnership agreement signed by the U.S. and Afghanistan in May 2012 both countries are obliged to negotiate a bilateral security agreement within one year. These negotiations were scheduled to begin on November 15, 2012. The talks will attempt to set conditions for U.S. forces in Afghanistan after 2014 as part of a \\"train, advise and assist\\" mission (U.S. President Obama and his national security team will determine the number of troops to be proposed) and are aimed at building a security framework, not a detailed agreement. Besides immunity from Afghan prosecution for U.S. soldiers accused of crimes and the Afghanistan demand that the U.S. guarantee that it will respond to any cross- border incursion or artillery attack on Afghanistan territory negotiators will attempt to set broad outlines for air rights over Afghanistan and the use and disposition of hundreds of U.S.-built bases—especially the huge air bases in Bagram and Kandahar. They may also discuss potential roles for U.S. Special Operations troops and unmanned drone aircraft, as well as the future of existing U.S. drone ground control stations in Afghanistan—subject to a final White House position on these issues. The details of these and other issues will be hammered out in \\"implementing documents\\" to be negotiated after any security agreement is signed. The Governments of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the United States of America officially launched their negotiations on a Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) on November 15, 2012, in Kabul. H.E. Eklil Hakimi, Ambassador of Afghanistan in Washington, was leading the Afghan negotiating team while Ambassador James Warlick, Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, was leading the United States negotiating team. Both sides affirmed that the key guiding principles in these important negotiations was full respect for Afghan sovereignty and Afghan national interests, including advancing the cause of peace and security across Afghanistan, strengthening the capacity and capabilities of Afghan national security forces so that they can independently provide security for the Afghan people and defend the country against external threats, and pursuing both countries' shared goal of eliminating trans-national terrorism. Both sides clarified that these negotiations are premised on the understanding that the United States does not seek permanent military bases in Afghanistan, or a presence that was perceived as a threat to Afghanistan's neighbors. Plans by the U.S. to engage in peace talks with the Taliban have resulted in suspension of bilateral security discussions between the US and Afghanistan on June 19, 2013. \\"In a special meeting chaired by President Hamid Karzai, the president has decided to suspend talks about a security pact with the U.S. because of their inconsistent statements and actions in regard to the peace process,\\" spokesman Aimal Faizi told Reuters. Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the flare-up with Mr. Karzai in phone calls on June 19, 2013, Afghan and U.S. officials said, part of the latest round of crisis diplomacy between Washington and Afghanistan's mercurial leader. Negotiations on the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) began earlier 2013 and, if completed, will define the shape of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan for years to come. The security discussions between the U.S. and Afghanistan would provide for a limited number of military trainers and counterterrorism forces to remain in the country. The talks have been complicated by several disagreements, including over the immunity that U.S. troops would enjoy from Afghan laws. Speaking to reporters days before the suspension, U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, the commander of the U.S.-led coalition, said, \\"The bilateral security agreement is critical to any post-2014 presence. So it needs to be taken seriously on both sides.\\" It wasn't clear how long Afghan President Karzai would withdraw from the security talks with the U.S., meant to finalise arrangements for keeping a small U.S. presence in the country after the last of the Nato troops leave 2014. Talks between the United States and Afghanistan over the bilateral security agreement have faltered in recent months over the Afghan government's insistence that the United States guarantee Afghanistan's security and, in essence, commit to declaring Pakistan the main obstacle in the fight against militancy in the region. The guarantees sought by Afghanistan, if implemented, could possibly compel the United States to attack Taliban havens in Pakistan long after 2014, when the Obama administration has said it hoped to dial back the CIA's covert drone war there. President Karzai also wanted the Obama administration to specify the number of troops it would leave in Afghanistan after 2014 and make a multiyear financial commitment to the Afghan Army and the police. The White House announced in June 2013 that long-delayed peace talks with the Taliban would begin in Doha, Qatar, where the Taliban opened what amounted to an embassy-in-exile, complete with their old flag and a plaque with their official name, \\"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\\" But the highly choreographed announcement backfired, with Afghan officials saying the talks gave the insurgents undeserved legitimacy and accusing the Obama administration of negotiating behind Karzai's back. To the surprise of American officials, President Karzai then abruptly ended the negotiations over the bilateral security agreement. He has said the negotiations would not resume until the Taliban met directly with representatives of the Afghan government, essentially linking the security negotiations to a faltering peace process and making the United States responsible for persuading the Taliban to talk to the Afghan government.  Agreement on core elements  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Afghan President Hamid Karzai announced on October 12, 2013 that they reached an agreement on a set of core elements of the bilateral security. Both however didn't reach an agreement on immunity from prosecution under Afghan law for American troops who remain in Afghanistan after 2014. This issue along with the entire agreement will be decided first by a traditional gathering of elders and other powerful people known as a loya jirga and then by the Afghan Parliament. The agreement provides a legal framework for continued U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, including the leasing of Afghan bases. Karzai said the draft framework agreement included his demands for the protection of Afghan sovereignty and rules on how military operations are to be carried out on Afghan territory. \\"Tonight we reached some sort of agreement,\\" Karzai told reporters. U.S. forces \\"will no longer conduct operations by themselves. We have been provided written guarantee of the safety of the Afghan people. And a clear definition of 'invasion' was provided.\\" \\"The one issue that is outstanding is the issue of jurisdiction,\\" Kerry added. \\"We need to say that if the issue of jurisdiction cannot be resolved, unfortunately there cannot be a bilateral security agreement.\\" Neither Kerry nor Karzai provided details of what exactly had been agreed to, and it was not clear how they had forged a compromise on an Afghan demand that the United States guarantee Afghanistan's security as it would if the country were a NATO ally. That could compel the United States to send troops on raids into America's nuclear-armed power ally Pakistan. Afghan officials had said that demand was crucial to the country's sovereignty and must be met. The Obama administration had said it would not consider making any such guarantee. According to the BBC's David Loyn said President Karzai failed to win security guarantees so that Afghanistan would be protected by US troops from external attack. Loyn added the US will not grant that as it could mire them in a war with Pakistan. On the other main sticking point, the outlines of a compromise seemed clearer. Karzai had refused to allow American forces to hunt for operatives of Al Qaeda here on their own. Instead, he wanted any intelligence gathered by the United States handed over to Afghan forces, who could then conduct the raids. Karzai said on October 12, 2013 he had been assured that American forces would not conduct any unilateral operations in Afghanistan after 2014, leaving open the possibility that raids against Al Qaeda would be conducted jointly with Afghan forces.  Draft agreement of bilateral security agreement  The United States and Afghanistan reached an agreement on the final language of the bilateral security agreement, which according to State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki wasn't the final document and which U.S. officials were still reviewing it, on November 20, 2013. A letter written by U.S. President Obama said U.S. forces will be \\"cooperating in training, advising, and assisting\\" Afghan forces \\"in a targeted, smaller, counterterrorism mission.\\" There is no limit on how long U.S. forces would remain in Afghanistan The accord also has no expiration date. The agreement says that \\"unless mutually agreed, United States forces shall not conduct combat operations in Afghanistan.\\" It states the parties' \\"intention of protecting U.S. and Afghan national interests without U.S. military counter- terrorism operations\\" but does not specifically prohibit such operations. United States Special Operations forces will retain leeway to conduct antiterrorism raids on private Afghan homes American counterterrorism operations will be intended to \\"complement and support\\" Afghan missions and that U.S. forces will not conduct military operations in Afghanistan \\"unless mutually agreed\\" the text says. It underscores that Afghan forces will be in the lead and that any American military operations will be carried out \\"with full respect for Afghan sovereignty and full regard for the safety and security of the Afghan people, including in their homes.\\" It also notes that \\"U.S. forces shall not target Afghan civilians, including in their homes, consistent with Afghan law and United States forces' rules of engagement.\\" U.S. President Barack Obama wrote in a letter to his Afghan counterpart: \\"US forces shall not enter Afghan homes for the purposes of military operations, except under extraordinary circumstances involving urgent risk to life and limb of US nationals. We will continue to make every effort to respect the sanctity and dignity of Afghans in their homes and in their daily lives, just as we do for our own citizens.\\" The agreement does not spell out the number of U.S. forces who will remain, but Afghan President Karzai said on November 21, 2013 that he envisions up to 15,000 NATO troops being based in the country. According to several estimates, the United States plans to maintain a force of no more than 10,000 troops in Afghanistan after 2014. The draft agreement allows an indefinite U.S. presence, but Karzai said on November 21, 2013 it would be in place for 10 years. The agreement also includes language on the U.S. government's continued funding for Afghan security forces, funneling such contributions through the Kabul-based government. The agreement text grants the United States full legal jurisdiction over U.S. troops and Defense Department civilians working in Afghanistan. On troop immunity, it says that Afghanistan agrees \\"that the United States shall have the exclusive right to exercise jurisdiction\\" over members of the force and its civilian component \\"in respect of any criminal or civil offenses committed in the territory of Afghanistan\\", and that \\"Afghanistan authorises the United States to hold [civil and criminal] trial in such cases, or take other disciplinary action, as appropriate, in the territory of Afghanistan\\", but Afghan authorities can ask that anyone be taken out of the country. Afghan authorities are prohibited from detaining American troops or U.S. civilians working with them. In the event that happens \\"for any reason,\\" however, those personnel \\"shall be immediately handed over to United States forces authorities.\\" The agreement also specifies that American troops and civilians cannot be surrendered to any \\"international tribunal or any other entity or state\\" without express U.S. consent. Afghanistan, it says, retains legal jurisdiction over civilian contractors, and contractors are prohibited from wearing military uniforms and \\"may only carry weapons in accordance with Afghan laws and regulations.\\" The document has a clause committing the United States to consulting with the Afghan government in the event of external threats, but not the sort of NATO- style mutual defense pact the Afghans originally wanted. \\"The United States shall regard with grave concern any external aggression or threat of external aggression against the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Afghanistan,\\" the proposed agreement states. There is a later clause saying they would \\"consult urgently\\" in the event of such aggression. U.S. President Obama added in a letter to his Afghan counterpart: \\"The US commitment to Afghanistan's independence, territorial integrity, and national unity, as enshrined in our Strategic Partnership Agreement, is enduring, as is our respect for Afghan sovereignty.\\" In a preamble, the draft specifies that \\"the United States does not seek permanent military facilities in Afghanistan, or a presence that is a threat to Afghanistan's neighbors, and has pledged not to use Afghan territory or facilities as a launching point for attacks on other countries.\\" It says that \\"unless otherwise mutually agreed, United States forces shall not conduct combat operations in Afghanistan\\" and makes no promise of U.S. military support in the event of an attack or other security threat to Afghanistan. If there is such a threat, it says, the United States will regard it with \\"grave concern,\\" consult and \\"shall urgently determine support it is prepared to provide.\\" But the United States stated the U.S. will regard any external aggression with \\"grave concern\\" and will \\"strongly oppose\\" military threats or force against Afghanistan after 2014. The draft agreement says that U.S. military and Defense Department civilian personnel are exempt from visa requirements and taxation. Afghan taxes and other fees will not be imposed on the entry or exit of goods specifically for the use of U.S. forces. An annex to the draft lists locations where Afghanistan agrees to provide facilities for U.S. forces, including Kabul; Bagram, north of the capital, where the United States has its largest current base; Mazar-e Sharif in northern Afghanistan; Herat in the west; Kandahar in the south; Shindand in Herat province; Sharab in Helmand province; Gardez, south of Kabul; and Jalalabad, to the east. The draft document gives the U.S. the right to deploy American forces on nine bases, including the two biggest, the airfields in Bagram and Kandahar. It also allows U.S. military planes to fly in and out of Afghanistan from seven air bases, including Kabul International Airport. U.S. forces would be permitted under the document to transport supplies from five border crossings, described along with the air bases as \\"official points of embarkation and debarkation.\\" All bases in Afghanistan would revert to Afghan ownership and sovereignty after 2014, according to the draft.  Finalization of draft agreement  The draft of the agreement was finalized early on November 19, 2013 after Obama wrote Karzai a letter assuring him that U.S. forces will continue to respect the \\"sanctity and dignity of the Afghan people.\\" The agreement must as of November 21, 2013 be ratified by an Afghan grand council of elders and by ratified by the parliaments of Afghanistan and the United States. The agreement, according to the draft wording, takes effect January 1, 2015 and then \\"it shall remain in force until the end of 2024 and beyond\\" unless terminated with two years' advance notice. Afghan President Karzai said that the agreement would not be signed until after 2014 elections in Afghanistan, but U.S. officials have said unequivocally that the agreement must be signed by the end of the year 2013, if not sooner, to allow the Pentagon to prepare for its role after the American combat mission ends. White House Press secretary Jay Carney said the agreement under consideration by the loya jirga is the Obama administration's \\"final offer.\\" If not enacted by the end of the year, Carney said, it \\"would be impossible for the United States and our allies to plan for a presence post-2014.\\" Karzai, who earlier stated he would sign what he had agreed to sign, stated later, after the announcement of the Bilatereal Security Agreement (BSA) draft text that, he wouldn't sign it until 2014, after a presidential election to choose his successor, but before he leaves office. Aimal Faizi, a spokesman for Karzai, stated that Karzai wanted to wait until after the election in April 2014 to test further conditions: whether American forces would stop raids on Afghan homes, whether the Obama Administration will help stabilize security in Afghanistan, help promote peace talks and not interfere in the election. Officials of the Obama Administration consider the signing date to be nonnegotiable, citing the need for at least a year to plan future deployments and to allow coalition partners, including Germany and Italy, to plan for a residual troop presence that they have offered.  Approval of bilateral security agreement  The text of the BSA was approved by the delegates at the Loya Jirga on November 24, 2013 and must now be signed by the Afghanistan president, who rejected the final recommendation of the Loya Jirga to promptly sign the BSA with the United States, and sent to the parliament for final ratification. While the Afghanistan parliament endorsed the BSA in 2013, Afghan President Harmid Karzai refuses as of February 6, 2014 to sign i.e. approve the BSA. If approved, the agreement would allow the U.S. to deploy military advisors to train and equip Afghan security forces, along with U.S. special-operations troops for anti-terrorism missions against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. President Obama will determine the size of the force. The jirga set a few conditions before expressing approval for the agreement among them a 10-year time limit on the post-2014 troop presence and reparations for damages caused by U.S. troops deployed in Afghanistan. It also voted attach a letter of U.S. President Obama; pledging that U.S. troops would enter Afghan homes only in \\"extraordinary\\" circumstances and only if American lives were at direct risk, to the BSA. The elder assembly also demanded the release of 19 Afghans from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay and a stronger U.S. pledge to defend Afghanistan from any incursion from it neighbors, particularly Pakistan. The loya jirga also voted to request that the U.S. military add a base to the nine bases that would be occupied by U.S. troops under the proposed security pact after combat forces depart Afghanistan by the end of 2014. The base is in Bamian Province in central Afghanistan, where the NATO-led military coalition has maintained a presence. Bamian is a population center for Hazaras, a Shiite minority whose members were massacred by the Taliban prior to the U.S.-led invasion that toppled the militant group. Afghan analysts said Hazara delegates proposed the additional base. At least five of the 50 jirga committees raised objections to the article addressing \\"status of personnel\\" which \\"authorises the United States to hold [civil and criminal] trial … or take other disciplinary action, as appropriate, in the territory of Afghanistan\\" when a US soldier is accused of criminal activity. Spokespeople from at least two committees directly stated that Afghanistan should have jurisdiction over any US soldiers accused of crimes on Afghan soil. Several committees also stated that if trials are held in the United States, families of victims should have access to and presence in US-held trials at the expense of Washington. As allied forces proceed to withdrawal troops, the international community wants to help and ensure that Afghanistan has security, political, and economic progress and to instill transparency and fairness of the elections. However, while the Afghanistan parliament endorsed the BSA in 2013, Afghan President Harmid Karzai refuses as of February 6, 2014, to sign i.e., approve the BSA. Presidential elections in Afghanistan are scheduled for April 2014 and the BSA is what is pending for the withdrawal of U.S. military and NATO forces. If it doesn't get signed and a civil war breaks out, the Taliban can easily regain their hold on the country, the most vulnerable citizens of the population, primarily women and children, stand to lose most. The possibility looms even greater if Karzai doesn't sign the BSA.  Signing of bilateral security agreement  Afghanistan and the United States signed the BSA signed through U.S. Ambassador James B. Cunningham and Afghan national security adviser Mohammad Hanif the bilateral security agreement on September 30, 2014 in a cordial ceremony at the presidential palace in Kabul, Afghanistan. On that day the NATO Status of Forces Agreement was also signed, giving forces from Allied and partner countries the legal protections necessary to carry out the NATO Resolute Support Mission when the International Security Assistance Force comes to an end in 2014. Under both agreements 9,800 American and at least 2,000 NATO troops are allowed to remain in Afghanistan after the international combat mission formally ends on December 31, 2014 while also enabling the continued training and advising of Afghan security forces, as well as counterterrorism operations against remnants of al-Qaeda. Most of the troops will help train and assist the struggling Afghan security forces, although some American Special Operations forces will remain to conduct counterterrorism missions. The Nato-led ISAF mission will transition to a training mission headquartered in Kabul with six bases around the country. Under the BSA the United States are allowed to have bases at nine separate locations across Afghanistan. A base in Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan, could also remain a launching point for armed drone missions in Afghanistan and across the border in Pakistan. The agreement also prevents U.S. military personnel from being prosecuted under Afghan laws for any crimes they may commit; instead, the United States has jurisdiction over any criminal proceedings or disciplinary action involving its troops inside the country. The provision does not apply to civilian contractors. The troop number of 9,800 Americans is to be cut in half by 2016, with American forces thereafter based only in Kabul and at Bagram air base. By the end of 2017, the U.S. force is to be further reduced in size to what U.S. officials have called a \\"normal\\" military advisory component at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, most likely numbering several hundred. The BSA goes into force on January 1, 2015 and remains in force \\"until the end of 2024 and beyond\\" unless it is terminated by either side with two years' notice.

Directed by Courtney Solomon and written by Gregg Maxwell Parker and Sean Finegan, the film is distributed by Warner Bros., the last Dark Castle Entertainment film to be released by Warner Bros., as Universal Studios took Dark Castle over in 2013. Though originally reported to be a remake of the 1972 film The Getaway, the film is actually an original story. This is the first film directed by Solomon in eight years, with his last being 2005's An American Haunting. The film was panned by critics and was a box office bomb, grossing $11.8 million against its $18 million budget. Plot Washed up former race driver Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke) arrives home to find his house ransacked and his wife, Leanne, missing. He then receives a phone call from a mysterious man known only as The Voice (Jon Voight), who reveals himself as the kidnapper of Magna's wife. The man tells Magna that he must follow a set of instructions precisely in order to be reunited with his wife. The Voice orders Magna to steal a specially customized Shelby Mustang from a parking garage. The Voice warns Magna that if he does not follow the instructions or is caught, Leanne will die. Magna sees two police officers chasing him and speeds off. Being a skilled driver, he is able to evade them with ease, eventually setting a trap to cause one to crash into the other. Despite more police cars joining the pursuit, Magna is able to out maneuver them. Magna is again contacted by The Voice, who directs him towards his next task. He tells Magna to speed up and take some perilous turns, eventually being forced to crash through a park, ice rink, and shopping center, nearly killing numerous civilians in the process. The Voice calls to congratulate him and tells him to keep moving. Magna is ordered to crash into a water truck and run through a red lighted intersection, causing accidents in his wake. Magna is then ordered to park in a construction zone and await further instructions. While Magna is waiting, a young woman, who is armed with a gun, known only as The Kid (Selena Gomez) attempts to steal Magna's car, but Magna overpowers her and takes her gun, and then takes her with him on The Voice's orders. The Voice then orders Magna to kill The Kid. Magna refuses, and The Voice says that keeping her alive was the right choice, as he will need her help. As Magna and The Kid drive off, with more police in pursuit, she reveals that the Mustang is, in fact, her car, and that she was told, by a police officer, it was stolen. Magna realizes that their meeting was orchestrated by The Voice. After the Voice assigns Magna another destructive task, The Kid reveals herself as a skilled computer hacker and the daughter of the C.E.O of a large bank. The Voice contacts Magna again and orders him to upload the contents of a USB flash drive into a computer before 11:30 pm. Upon reaching the designated area, a power plant, The Kid attempts to hack the computer in order to contact the police. She appears to succeed, only for The Voice to reveal that he set up the computer as a trap for her, framing her as the person who destroyed the plant. The plant suddenly overloads and explodes, blacking out a large portion of the city. The Voice gives Magna his final task: to rob the bank owned by The Kid's father. The Kid points out that there is no actual money at her father's bank; it is an investment firm which holds all of its assets on computers. Gradually, the duo realizes that they are not actually committing a heist, but are merely providing a distraction for the police while The Voice executes the real robbery and subsequently frames them for it. As The Voice's men attempt to commandeer an armored car carrying sensitive hard drives, Magna surprises and overpowers them, succeeding in taking the drives. Now fleeing from the police and The Voice's men, Magna calls The Voice and offers to release the hard drives in exchange for his wife. The Voice accepts and directs him to an airplane hangar. While it appears that Leanne is about to be returned, The Kid deduces that The Voice is planning to have them all killed when the deal is done. As Magna, Leanne, and The Kid attempt to escape, the police arrive, and in the ensuing chaos, a man Magna assumes to be The Voice grabs The Kid and drives off with her. Magna leaves Leanne with the police and pursues. Following a high speed chase, both cars are destroyed, Magna rescues The Kid, and the police arrest the mysterious man. Leanne and Magna are reunited. However, Magna receives a phone call from The Voice, revealing that the man who was busted was no more than a decoy. The Voice thanks Magna for his help and hangs up. It is revealed that The Voice was in fact controlling the entire operation from a bar in the United States. He checks his balance, revealing that almost 3 billion dollars have been transferred to his account, and walks out of the bar.

Box Office Mojo. Retrieved December 31, 2104. Variety magazine listed Getaway as one of \\"Hollywood's biggest box office bombs of 2013\\". =Critical response= Getaway was considered to be one of the worst films of 2013. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 3% based on 142 reviews, with an average rating of 2.73/10.

On Metacritic the film has a score of 22 out of 100, based on reviews from 34 critics indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". IGN said \\"Not even the gruffly likable Ethan Hawke can make the murky, messy car chase movie Getaway worthwhile thanks to its inane script and poorly conceived action sequences\\" (Rating 3/10). Selena Gomez's performance was also criticized by The Atlantic magazine, with the actress being described as \\"a kid trying desperately to act like a grownup, but with no real idea what that might entail\\". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called it a \\"brainless chase flick that doesn't even offer guilty pleasures.\\" Scott Foundas of Variety said in his review, \\"Solomon has made something like a 'Cannonball Run' for the YouTube Generation, with the largely incoherent action photographed (by cinematographer Yaron Levy) from dozens of small digital cameras mounted inside and outside the Shelby and cut in a Cuisinart\\". =Accolades= At the 2014 Golden Raspberry Awards Selena Gomez was nominated in the Worst Actress category.

Background and detail  Continuing frictions with the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London, combined with Henry's desire to secure Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk, the leading Yorkist heir, sheltering in Burgundy, led Henry to attempt further negotiations, even after the ratification of the Intercursus Magnus in 1496.

This enabled Henry to negotiate the ' (\\"\\", so named from the Dutch perspective for being far too favorable to English interests), intended to replace the '. This replacement removed all duties from English textile exports without reciprocity and with little compensation for the Burgundians. 49-year-old Henry, widowed three years previously, also arranged to be married to Philip's sister, the twice- widowed 26-year-old Margaret. Finally Philip of Burgundy was forced to hand over Edmund de la Pole. Henry also recognised Philip and Joanna as the rulers of Castille (seeing as Queen Isabella I of Castile had died in 1504). After handing over de la Pole, Philip and Joanna were allowed to leave England after a forced stay of six weeks.Penn, Thomas, Winter King: The Dawn of Tudor England, Allen Lane, London, 2011, p. 213-226 Margaret's objection—both to the marriage and the treaty more generally—meant that, on Philip's death that September and Margaret's appointment as Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands (and de facto ruler), the treaty was not ratified being replaced instead by a third treaty in 1507, repeating the terms of the first.

Following her departure TPP filed a lawsuit against Kremer alleging she had tried to prevent others from accessing the group's collective resources. Tea Party Express (2009–2014) Kremer campaigning for Ted Cruz in the 2012 U.S. Senate election in Texas Soon after joining Tea Party Express, Kremer urged the organization to support Scott Brown's campaign for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts. During the 2010 midterm elections Kremer campaigned for candidates including Joe Miller, who ran for the U.S. Senate in Alaska. She also endorsed Tom Tancredo, the American Constitution Party candidate for governor of Colorado. In October 2010, The Daily Telegraph named her the \\"most influential\\" person in the Tea Party movement. In a 2011 appearance on The Colbert Report, Kremer said the U.S. federal government raised \\"enough tax revenue to service our debt, pay for Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, and then still have about $300 [billion] or $400 billion left over.\\" PolitiFact.com rated this statement \\"Half True\\", noting that Kremer's calculations ignored defense and homeland security spending and mandatory programs. In June 2011 Kremer said TPE would support Mitt Romney if he became the Republican nominee in the 2012 presidential election. A co- founder of Tea Party Patriots rejected Kremer's remarks, saying \\"a pledge of allegiance to the Republican Party, or any other party, violates what the Tea Party movement is all about and is completely out of touch with grassroots Americans\\". In the 2012 elections TPE endorsed U.S. Senate candidate Richard Mourdock in Indiana; in September 2011 Kremer described Mourdock as a \\"true conservative.\\" During a September 2012 appearance on CNN's Starting Point, host Soledad O'Brien and others criticised Kremer for wondering whether President Barack Obama \\"loves America.\\" In 2013 Kremer said that U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, a member of the Republican Party, voted \\"more with Democrats than with conservatives.\\" PolitiFact.com rated this claim as \\"False\\", citing an analysis by The Washington Post that found Chambliss voted with fellow Republicans 91 percent of the time in 2011 and 2012. Kremer spent much of the summer 2013 congressional recess on a national tour intended to convince Republicans to support defunding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Kremer resigned from Tea Party Express in April 2014. She described the split as amicable and attributed her departure to a desire to focus on Matt Bevin's campaign for the U.S. Senate in Kentucky, instead of Curt Clawson's campaign in Florida's 19th congressional district. 2016 presidential election As of February 2016, Kremer was the chair of TrumPAC, a super PAC supporting Donald Trump's campaign in the 2016 presidential election. TrumPAC later changed its name to Great America PAC. Great America PAC was founded by Kremer and William Doddridge, the CEO of The Jewelry Exchange. Kremer resigned from Great America PAC in May 2016, shortly after Trump became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, due to decisions which she claimed had been made without her input. In June 2016 Kremer, along with Kathryn Serkes and Ann Stone, founded Women Vote Trump, a new super PAC that aimed to raise at least $30 million to support Trump's campaign. Stone said the group would organize volunteers and advertise across the United States. At an event the following month Kremer said \\"People assume that just because [Democratic presidential nominee] Hillary Clinton is a woman that I'm going to support her. That's an insult to my intelligence. I have the ability to think on my own.\\" Kremer made appearances on CNN, Fox News and MSNBC to promote the PAC. In August 2016 Kremer claimed on CNN that Clinton was suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease found in people who have suffered repeated blows to the head. Federal Election Commission records showed that Women Vote Trump, which changed its name to Women Vote Smart in order to comply with regulations that prohibit the use of candidates' names, had only raised $26,813, had spent $20,000, and was nearly $20,000 in debt as of March 2017. Kremer said the group \\"had commitments from people and then people didn't come through,\\" but that it was \\"definitely out there being active with the grassroots and engaging people.\\" 2017 congressional campaign Georgia's 6th congressional district In 2017, Kremer ran as a Republican in the special election in Georgia's 6th congressional district, which was vacant following Representative Tom Price's confirmation as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. In an April 2017 interview Kremer said \\"the biggest issue facing the Sixth District\\" was its \\"stagnant economy\\", which she suggested be fixed by cutting \\"government regulations that stifle job growth\\", cutting \\"government waste\\", creating \\"a pro-growth environment\\", and lowering individual and corporate taxes. She said her priorities in Congress would be employment and the economy, national security, repealing and replacing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and taking care of veterans. Kremer said she should be elected because she had \\"carried the values of the 6th District\\" with her as she \\"worked tirelessly to preserve freedom and liberty through electing conservatives like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and many others\\". The radio and television host Sean Hannity and the Tea Party activist Katrina Pierson endorsed Kremer's campaign. In March 2017 Kremer offered supporters who donated to her campaign the opportunity to win an AR-15 style rifle. Kremer explained: \\"We are very pro-2nd Amendment not only in Georgia but in the south.\\" In an email to supporters, Kremer criticised a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit that affirmed Maryland's ban on military-style \\"assault weapons\\" (see Gun laws in Maryland) and called on supporters to \\"show these progressive judges that we will not surrender the rights granted by God and preserved in the U.S. Constitution\\". Greg Bluestein of The Atlanta Journal- Constitution observed in March 2017 that Kremer's campaign had \\"struggled to gain traction\\" against better-known and better-funded Republican candidates. In March 2017 Kremer's entire campaign staff resigned after she allegedly only raised around $2,500 and was unable to pay her campaign manager and at least six other staff members. One member of staff who resigned had been staying at Kremer's house and contacted police after Kremer allegedly changed the locks and prevented him from getting his belongings. The staff members who resigned were subsequently hired by the campaign of Bob Gray, another Republican candidate in the special election. In the primary election on April 18, 2017, Kremer received 351 votes, or 0.18 percent of the total vote tally, and did not advance to the runoff election.  Women for Trump and Women for America First In June 2018, Kremer, who by then was a co-founder of Women for Trump, was interviewed on CNN, where she insisted that family separations at the U.S.–Mexico border were occurring at the same level for both the Obama administration and the Trump administration. She claimed that Jeh Johnson, the Obama administration's United States Secretary of Homeland Security, said that \\"they were separating families\\". However, CNN played the actual quote from Johnson, who had said: \\"There's no policy or practice, at least on my watch, to separate women, parents from their children\\", although he was sure there still were \\"individual cases for reasons of health or safety\\" of such happenings. Kremer's on-the-spot reaction was to insist that her quote of Johnson \\"happened\\", although later she tweeted that she had \\"conflated 2 different articles with quotes from 2 different Obama\\" administration officials. In 2019 Kremer and her daughter Kylie founded Women for America First, which organized a protest against the impeachment of Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. in October 2019. In April 2020 Women for America First organized several protests against stay-at-home orders implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, it focuses on three interrelated dimensions: politics, media and electorate. Spatial comparative election communication research investigates campaign practices, its media responses and its effects on the electorate in different countries. History The development of election campaign communication can be divided in three phases, a traditional, party-centered period after World War II, a media-centered, personalizing and professionalizing modern period from the 1960s to the 1980s and a still emerging postmodern phase or period of political marketing, characterized by marketing-logics, fragmentation of voter groups, negativity and new media channels.cf. Blumler, & Kavanagh (1999) Comparative campaign communication research emerged in the period of modern campaigning in the 1970s, when research revealed similar trends in campaigning in Western democracies.cf. Esser, & Pfetsch (2004)cf. Blumler, & Kavanagh (1999) One of the first European studies in this field by media and communication theorist Jay Blumler and his colleaguescf. Blumler, Cayrol, & Tonveron (1978) examined the effect of television campaigning on electorate and their interest in the election by comparing the 1974 election campaigns in UK, France and Belgium. The question of how the media affect the electorate was of great interest in European research of that time, while U.S. American scholars focused on how election campaigns were conducted and orientated towards mass media.cf. Esser, & Pfetsch (2004) A number of political journalists and scholars such as Theodore W. White,cf. White (1961) Joe Mc Giddens,cf. McGinnis (1969) and Joe Napolitancf. Napolitan (1972) analyzed strategies of presidential campaigning in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s. When campaigning style internationally processed towards marketing driven practices in the 1980s and 1990s, research followed with increasing interest and establishment of international approaches.cf. Blumler, & Kavanagh (1999) In a widely acknowledged study the political scientists David L. Swanson and Paolo Mancinicf. Mancini, & Swanson (1996) in 1996 compared 11 democracies with regard to the Americanization hypothesis and examined the consequences of modernization for politics, media and their interrelations. Their study revealed international common patterns in media centered campaigning. Swanson and Mancini established the Americanization hypothesis as a yardstick for research and emphasized the explanatory value of modernization for comparative research. Theoretical Approaches Some of the most common theoretical approaches of international comparative studies in election campaign communication research are: =Modernization= The theoretical assumption of modernization derives similar developments or convergence of campaign communication practices in Western democracies, present e.g. in the political systems of United States and UK, from professionalization of society. Professionalization is therefore assessed as a consequence of differentiation in modern societies in general, which affects organization, management and style of political campaigning as well as the multiplicity of media and the fragmentation of voter groups.cf. Mancini, & Swanson (1996), pp. 6-18cf. Kaid, & Holtz-Bacha (2008), pp. 466-467 =Americanization= The term Americanization relates these processes to a U.S. American starting point from which other Western democratic societies adapted successful U.S. American strategies of campaigning as most advanced practices. Characteristics of Americanized electoral campaigning are e.g., professionalization, that is the engagement of political consultants, media- and television centered as well as negative campaigning and personalization, e.g., campaigns focusing on individual candidates instead of the candidates’ parties.cf. Kaid, & Holtz-Bacha (2008)cf. Mancini, & Swanson (1996), pp. 4-8 =Media Dependency Theory= This model serves political election campaign research “where the relationship between mass media and the electors and candidates remains a central focus.”Kaid, & C. Holtz-Bacha (2008), p. 182 According to media dependency theory “the extent of media effects is related to the degree of dependence of individuals and societal systems on media.”.Kaid, & C. Holtz-Bacha (2008), p. 182 Following this approach, differences and consistencies in campaigning practices are consequences of common or diverse interdependencies between media, politics and individuals. If, e.g., people's needs are satisfied to the same extent and in the same way by media in two countries, media dependency theory expects these countries’ media to have a similar impact on people's voting decision. =Hybridization= “Hybridization means a country-specific supplementation of traditional campaign practices with select features of the media driven, post- modern style of campaigning.”Plasser, & Plasser (2002), p. 348 According to hybridization theory as subconcept of modernization global, i.e. macro-level, campaigning trends supplement country-specific campaign practices, i.e. on the micro-level, considering particularities in political culture. Examples of post-modern campaign practices are increasing negativity of campaigns, virtual campaigning via online media or television debates of single party leaders.cf. Plasser, & Plasser (2002) When, e.g., negativity in campaigning is observable but limited by national law, this can be an indication for hybridization. The theories of modernization and Americanization were debated controversially especially in the 1970s and 1980s. Americanization hypothesis has suffered a lot of criticism for not considering national differences in political structures and media systems, in particular diverse voting systems and campaigning restrictions. Modernization and professionalization are regarded as more adequate theoretical approaches, as their assumption of a general international trend in campaigning is not contradictory to national particularities. Today Americanization serves as a yardstick, while context- sensitive approaches like media dependency theory, modernization and hybridization are widely established.cf. Esser, & Pfetsch (2004)cf. Blumler, & Kavanagh (1999) State of the Art Americanization is still a point of reference for comparative election campaign communication research under the assumption of modernization processes. The field of election campaign communication is examined by a number of disciplines, e.g. political science, sociology as well as social psychology, media and communication sciences and economics. As a consequence different perspectives on political election campaign communication, e.g., political marketing, digital campaigning or political public relations, emerge.cf. Gurevitch, & Blumler (2004) To the multiplicity and fragmentation of the field of study in theoretical and methodological approaches, media and communications scientists Jesper Strömbäck and political communication scholar Frank Esser tried to define a comprehensive framework of comparative election campaign communication research in 2012.Esser, & Strömbäck (2012) They developed an approach that relates contextual variables to different models of election campaigning and show their empirically observable attributes. According to them, research on different types of campaigning should be accompanied by a context variable considering political systems, e.g., a presidential or parliamentary political system, and a context variable referring to media systems, e.g. multichannel or narrow-range mediascapes. As empirically observable attributes of campaign organization and electorate, such as organizational resources, like online activism and party membership, and characteristics of mass media, such as news coverage, should be examined. Findings In international comparative research on campaign practices the study by political scientists Gunda and Fritz Plassercf. Plasser, & Plasser (2002) revealed a hybridization of global campaign practices and local political culture in 19 countries in 2002. With regard to international comparative research on election news coverage, e.g. Jesper Strömbäck and Toril Aalbergcf. Strömbäck, & Aalberg (2008) in 2008 explained diversities in similar countries like Sweden and Norway by different framing concepts, media bias as well as cultural and structural variations. Differences in political news culture were first examined in 2008 by Frank EsserEsser (2008) who developed a typology of political television news culture by a cross-analysis of sound bite and image bite news in France, Germany, UK, and the U.S.. Regarding the extent of journalistic or editorial influence an interventionist U.S. American approach, a moderately interventionist Anglo-German approach, and a noninterventionist French approach were identified. A market-orientation of political campaigning addressing voters as consumers of a political product was revealed by political scientist David M. Farrell in 2002.Esser, & Strömbäck (2012)Farell (2002) Lynda L. Kaid and Christina Holtz-Bacha examined political TV advertising in 12 countries in 2006. By, e.g., an analysis of structural country-specific TV campaigning restrictions and a content analysis of the TV adverts, the two communications scientists identified transnational campaigning trends such as the emphasis of political issues and the disregard of party issues.Esser, & Strömbäck (2012) Methods For detailed information about methods of comparative election campaign communication research see Research strategies of election campaign communication research. =Scope of Research= Comparative election campaign communication research strives for spatial and temporal analyses.cf. Karlsen (2009) \\\\- Spatial comparison focuses internationally on most different outcomes in most similar political systems, e.g. election campaigning news coverage in democratic corporatist countries like Sweden and Denmark.cf. Strömbäck, & Aalberg (2008) Furthermore, comparative analysis can examine similar outcomes in most different political systems by investigating e.g. in effects of promotional activity and different electoral systems on voter turnout in British and German EU elections.cf. Whitelock, Whitelock, & van Heerde (2010) \\\\- Temporal comparison analyses single-country specific differences and similarities in diverse periods of time.cf. Karlsen (2009) =Research Instruments= Depending on the object of analysis, network research, e.g. interviews with consultants to analyze professional networks, survey research, e.g. opinion polls or marketing surveys, content analysis, e.g. of news coverage, and experimental research can be chosen as research instruments.cf. Kaid (2004) =Sampling= Comparative analysis examines the usage and effects of different media channels that are employed by political campaign communication, while corresponding types of media technology are considered as objects of analysis as well.cf. Karlsen (2009) These channels can be divided in two groups: 1\\\\. Party controlled channels, e.g. partisan press and TV spots. 2\\\\. Party uncontrolled channels, e.g. independent news outlets.cf. Karlsen (2009) Besides media conditions, actors in election campaigning e.g., political consultants, politicians or voters are taken into account for an analysis of practices and effects of campaign communication. =Validity= Regarding in particular the validity of international and intercultural comparative approaches, research methods are required to deliver adequate culture-specific measurements of observed phenomena and practices to consider different cultural contexts.cf. Wirth, & Kolb (2004)cf. Gurevitch, & Blumler (2004) Criticism and Limitations Election campaign communication research suffers criticism for lacking interdisciplinary exchange, e.g. between political science, psycho-sociology and media and communications science. Another reproach is being made for a too Western-centered scope of research, e.g., disregarding campaigning practices in African or Asian nations. Related to this, methods of international comparison are criticized for an insufficient consideration of country-specific political cultures, norms and language- barriers.cf. Esser, & Pfetsch (2004)cf. Gurevitch, & Blumler (2004)Farell (2003) In accordance, limitations of international research methods lie in the coordination of different national theoretical approaches and diverse ways to interpret the found results in an international team of researchers. As a consequence of cultural differences, language barriers and limited financial resources, research is often bound to Western regions, which partly explains the Western-centered scope.cf.

This approach provides a semantic and statistical representation of knowledge. Saffron learns from all sources of data including structured and unstructured data to support knowledge-based decision making. Its patented technology captures the connections between data points at the entity level and stores these connections in an associative memory. Similarity algorithms and predictive analytics are then combined with the associative index to identify patterns in the data. Saffron’s Natural Intelligence platform was utilized by Global 1000 companies across industries including manufacturing, energy, defense and healthcare, to help decision-makers manage risks, identify opportunities and anticipate future outcomes, thus reducing cost and increasing productivity. Competitors include IBM Watson and Grok. Intel purchased the company in 2015 then shuttered it less than 3 years later. History Saffron was founded in 1999 by Dr Manuel Aparicio, a recognized pioneer in the field of Associative Memories, and Mr. James Fleming, a software engineer and leader in intelligent agent development. In 2000, former National Security Advisor Admiral (Dr.) John Poindexter joined the board with a focus of applying Associative Memory technology in the fields of National Security and Intelligence. In the first years, the company did most of its work with the U.S. Department of Defense, including in Iraq, analyzing and predicting where IED’s would be located so insurgent bombers could be proactively targeted. In 2010, the analyst firm Gartner identified Saffron as a \\"Cool Vendor\\" in Information Infrastructure for Enterprise Information Management In 2011, Forrester Research highlighted Saffron Technology as the leader of associative indexing in \\"The Dawning of a New Age in BI DBMS\\". On March 3, 2014 Saffron Technology raised a round of Series B funding. In October 2015, Intel bought Saffron Technology for an undisclosed price. Intel offered the licensed software with engineering services contracted to develop client applications and support ongoing use. In August 2018, Intel discontinued the Saffron software offering and supporting engineering services.

National security During the Iraqi insurgency Saffron was used by coalition forces in Iraq to help identify entities that were defined as people, places and things involved in insurgent networks. The tool mimicked human memory by recalling associations between those people, places and things. Unlike other tools, Saffron focused on context and frequency of association. Each word representing an entity in a set of data had its own memory about all the other words it had been used in association with. In this way, the tool could learn the way humans did. Saffron was contracted by DARPA to work on Project Genoa.

The design of a PPT system encourages utility (usually trips) over revenue. Overview While most public transport systems operate on specific routes with set timetables, PPT systems utilize a network of vehicles at various locations for users when they desire them, allowing those users to take any route that serves their needs and to return the vehicle to any designated point within the coverage area. The user operates or directs, in an auto-drive vehicle, the vehicle to the destination versus this being done by a driver or conductor in traditional public transport options. Similar to traditional public transport options, the system is managed by a transit authority or private transport operator but the pricing model encourages users to return the vehicle quickly. Maximizing vehicle utility over revenue means operators seek revenue from other sources such as advertising, subsidy and system sponsorship. Terminology Personal public transport was conceptualized to explain the unique difference in service provided over traditional public transport options such as bus, rail, taxi and rapid transit as well as paratransit and personal rapid transport. Coverage area Instead of utilizing routes, in the way that traditional public transport does, a PPT system operates within a defined area, termed the coverage area. Vehicles can be found or left anywhere the law allows within that area or at specific locations within the coverage area. Examples of specific locations can be public or private demarcated areas shared with other vehicles or specific station locations. Vehicles and services The vehicle is designed to cater to an individual user or a small party’s transport needs. The vehicles are intended for a single trip on public thoroughfares either shared by other modes or segregated. The user is responsible for adhering to all laws and regulations while using the vehicle and enforcement is done through existing public law enforcement mechanisms such as licensing and ticketing. Access to PPT While a PPT is a general public transport service, it generally requires users to be registered with the system or to pay a deposit to ensure the return of the vehicle in good working condition. The tipping point of successful PPT systems has been the application of information technology systems (ITS) enabling user identification and vehicle tracking in a system. This is usually aided by Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID) and real-time information flow using wireless internet. GPS tracking devices are also common in vehicles to guard against theft. Financing and pricing PPT is financed through a variety of mechanisms similar to other public transportation projects. Capital costs are usually covered through government subsidy (exceptions do exist) and there are multiple revenue streams which strive to cover operating costs. Revenue streams vary greatly depending on the system and attributes and laws of the area it is implemented. Many times government subsidies are needed to meet the operating costs. The pricing model of PPT encourages short trips and multiple uses over revenue. This pricing model prioritizes utility at the expense of revenue and is a key differentiating factor between PPT and private vehicle hire and some other modes of public transport. Examples Many bicycle sharing programs globally are examples of PPT.Ministry of Urban Development Government of India. 'Public Cycle Sharing Systems A Planning Toolkit for Indian Cities'. December, 2012.Jain, Umang. ‘The promise of bike-share in India’. April 30, 2013. Large citywide bicycle sharing programs such as Velib, Capital Bikeshare, and BIXI Montréal all have attributes of PPT. Bicycle rental enterprises are not PPTs because the bicycles have to be used and returned to a single location and the pricing model encourages users to keep the bicycles out for greater lengths of time. Some car sharing systems are also examples of PPT.

Howey (born 1975) is an American writer, known best for the science fiction series Silo, part of which he published independently through Amazon.com's Kindle Direct Publishing system. Howey was raised in Monroe, North Carolina and before publishing his books, he worked as a book store clerk, yacht captain, roofer, and audio technician. Wool He began the series in 2011, initially writing Wool as a stand-alone short story. His first book was initially published with a small press. After that, he decided to publish through Amazon.com's Kindle Direct Publishing system, because of the freedom of self-publishing. After the series grew in popularity, he began to write more entries for it. Howey began soliciting international rights in 2012, including signing a deal for Brazil. Film rights to the series were sold to 20th Century Fox; Lionsgate also expressed interest. In 2012, Howey signed a deal with Simon & Schuster to distribute Wool to book retailers across the US and Canada. The deal allowed Howey to continue to sell the book online exclusively. He notably turned down seven figure offers in favor of a mid-six figure sum, in return for maintaining e-book rights. He has also signed publishing contracts with Random House Century UK for UK distribution of both his Wool and Sand series, published as novels of the same names. Howey became closely tied to both Amazon/Kindle Direct Publishing and self-publishing as a leader of the new paradigm of publishing. He opened up his Silo Saga to other authors, formalizing that effort when he signed with Kindle Worlds. Though authors like Fredric Shernoff (Atlantic Island), Jason Gurley (Eleanor), and Michael Bunker (Pennsylvania) all experienced some degree of success that can be attributed to Howey, Wool, and the Kindle Worlds project, nobody was able to replicate Wools success either through tie-in books or those authors' original stories.

On April 18, 2012 the Los Angeles Times released photos of U.S. soldiers posing with body parts of dead insurgents, after a soldier in the 82nd Airborne Division gave the photos to the L.A. Times to draw attention to \\"a breakdown in security, discipline and professionalism\\" among U.S. troops operating in Afghanistan. The pictures had been taken at a police station in Zabol province in February 2010. The event followed two other recent and embarrassing revelations about soldier morale and discipline in the US army: the case of soldiers urinating on dead Taliban soldiers in 2011, which was made public in January 2012, and the burning of the Quran by at Bagram Airfield, which had occurred in February.  Reactions U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta immediately called the soldiers' behavior unacceptable, promised a full investigation, and said about the soldiers behavior in comparison to the U.S. armed forces in general: \\"This is not who we are, and it's certainly not what we represent when it comes to the great majority of men and women in uniform.\\" The actions of the soldiers were also condemned by General John Allen, commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF). US Ambassador to Afghanistan Ryan Crocker said: \\"The actions were morally repugnant, dishonor the sacrifices of hundreds of thousands of U.S. soldiers and civilians who have served with distinction in Afghanistan, and do not represent the core values of the United States or our military.\\" The New York Times reported that President Obama called for an investigation of the matter and said that those responsible would be held accountable. In Afghanistan, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid called the pictures disrespectful and condemned both the U.S. soldiers involved in the pictures as well as the Afghan police also featured in them. \\"We strongly condemn these occupiers and their puppets who are without culture, who are brutal and inhuman,\\" Mujahid said. \\"Next to these occupiers there are some Afghans -- puppets -- who were ordered to stand next to the bodies of the martyrs.\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/karzai-latest-us-troop- photos-disgusting/ Afghan President Hamid Karzai called it \\"a disgusting act to take photos with body parts and then share it with others\\". A day after the photos were released, there had been no news of mass protests by the Afghan people like the earlier Quran burnings in February, which Afghan lawmakers ascribed to the Afghan people's lack of sympathy for suicide bombers. Mohammad Naim Lalai Hamidzai, a parliamentarian from southern Kandahar, told the Associated Press that \\"the people of Afghanistan remember the killing of innocent people by suicide bombers and people do not have a good image of these suicide bombers. The burning of Qurans and the killing of children create emotions in people, but there is no sympathy for suicide bombers who kill innocent people.\\" Another reason for the muted reaction in Afghanistan was that evening TV bulletins did not show the photos and that many ordinary Afghans had no internet access. Investigation and action On the day of the release, the Army announced that it had started a criminal investigation. By 2018, there were no reports freely available on the World Wide Web about the results of the investigation. On May 4, 2012, however, weeks after the pictures' release, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta visited Ft. Benning, Georgia and spoke to the 3rd Infantry Brigade about the need for discipline. He said, \\"These days it takes only seconds for a picture, a photo, to suddenly become an international headline. And those headlines can impact the mission we're engaged in. They can put your fellow service members at risk. They can hurt morale. They can damage our standing in the world, and they can cost lives.\\"Brian Bennett (May 5, 2012).

A portion of it was in existence by the 14th century, and appears on the 1610 map of the town by cartographer John Speed. It runs in a north-south direction, extending northward from its intersection with Whitecross Street. The name of the street relates to the nearby Priory, as well as the gate which was originally on this road and provided part of the town's defences, Monk's Gate. Monk Street is lined with numerous listed buildings. History and location By the 14th century, a portion of the street plan of Monmouth had been determined. It is believed that Monk Street derived its name from the nearby Priory. On the map of the town of Monmouth (pictured) created by John Speed in 1610, Monk Street extends from its intersection with Whitecross Street northward to Monk's Gate. Monk's Gate was a component of the town's defences. While the gates of the town outlasted the walls themselves, Monk's Gate was removed in 1710. The curved wall at the Masonic Hall entrance may indicate its previous location. On current maps, Monk Street extends northward from Whitecross Street to the intersection with Priory Street on the west and New Dixton Road on the east. Priory Street was designed by architect George Vaughan Maddox and built in the 1830s as a bypass to reduce carriage traffic in Church Street, which was eventually pedestrianized. Monk Street continues northward beyond the intersection, although in some maps or texts the segment past the intersection is referred to as The Parade or North Parade. In addition, on some modern maps, the eastern leg of Whitecross Street, from the intersection with Monk Street to its termination at the roundabout encircling St James' Square, is also referred to as St James' Square, such that some buildings on Whitecross Street have two addresses. Buildings 1 Monk Street (pictured below), the former Working Men's Free Institute, is a grade II listed building. It was built by Newport architect Benjamin Lawrence and has a facade of Old Red Sandstone and Bath Stone trim. It is located next to Monmouth Baptist Church, also built by Lawrence. It now houses an art gallery and shop. The Monmouth Baptist Church (pictured below) at 3 Monk Street is an early-20th-century, grade II listed building. Also referred to as the Baptist Chapel, it was designed by Newport architect Benjamin Lawrence. The chapel was built in the Gothic style in 1906–1907. The two-storey building features a Welsh slate roof, red sandstone walls, and an octagonal bell tower. It is located on the east side of Monk Street, opposite St. Mary's Church. 5 Monk Street is a listed building. The Royal George Hotel (pictured below), on Monk Street, is an early-18th-century, grade II* listed building. Also referred to as the Ivy Bank House or Ivy Bank Hotel, the building features Corinthian pillars and a hipped slate roof. It was built in the 1730s and converted to apartments in the 1970s. It is located across the road from the Oak House. Oak House (pictured below) at 6 Monk Street is a 19th-century, grade II listed building. It was built in the 1840s by architect by George Vaughan Maddox. The three-storey house has three bays along the entrance elevation on Monk Street, while the north elevation along Priory Street has four bays. There is a hipped slate roof with two chimneys. It now serves as the Telephone Exchange and is located opposite the Royal George. 7 Monk Street, on the east side of the road, is also referred to as Ty Mawr. It is an early-19th-century, three- story, grade II listed building with a stucco exterior. Kingsley House and Hendre House (pictured below) at 8 Monk Street and 10 Monk Street are a pair of semi-detached dwellings. The complex is an early-19th-century, grade II listed building. The three-storey, five-bay house has a hipped slate roof. The entrance has a six panelled door with a fanlight. The stucco facade is notable for its blocked central windows. The building is the work of architect George Vaughan Maddox. 9 Monk Street is an early-19th-century, grade II listed building. Also referred to as Sanroyd House, it is a 3-storey building with a stucco exterior and slate roof. The Masonic Hall (pictured below) was converted from a theatre by George Vaughan Maddox in 1846. The previous Monk Street Theatre had occupied its Georgian building from 1838 to 1844. A curved wall adjacent to the entrance of the Masonic Hall is thought to be indicative of the site of a portion of Monk's Gate. The 19th-century, grade II listed building is on the west side of the road. 11 Monk Street has two listings in the records maintained in the collection of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales. In one, there is reference to a coach house, which is a listed building. 11 Monk Street, the second listing for this address, is also referred to as Fitzroy House and The Gatehouse(s). It is a three-storey, early-19th-century, grade II listed building. It is north of New Dixton Road on the east side. The entrance features large Greek Doric columns. Cadogan House at 12 Monk Street is an early-19th-century, listed building. The three-storey house has a slate roof. Cadogan House is remarkable as the site of discovery of a 15th-century kiln which produced floor and roof tiles. 13 Monk Street is a listed building of uncertain date. The three-storey, single-bay house has a painted exterior and slate roof. The ground and middle floors each have a two light window. The topmost floor has a six plus six window akin to a weaver's window. 14 Monk Street is an early-19th-century, listed building. The Regency style house has a slate roof. 16 and 18 Monk Street represent a single building with two doors. Also referred to as Stoneleigh, it is an early-19th-century, three-storey, three bay, listed building. Singleton House at 20 Monk Street is an early-19th- century, listed building. The three-storey, three-bay house has a central entry. The ground and middle floors have a recessed arch at the centre. The ground floor windows are also in recessed arches. The entrance has a six panelled door with fanlight. The roof is of Welsh slate and there are two chimneys. Wrought iron railings are present, as well as a trellis porch. The late Georgian building was listed due to its special architectural interest. Chapel House (pictured below) on the west side of Monk Street, at the level of the Parade, is an 18th-century, grade II* listed building. It is a seven-bay house, the central three having narrow windows. Praised by author John Newman as \\"the best house in the entire street,\\" its interior features a central hall with a wreathed plaster ceiling and a staircase reminiscent of that at Troy House. Parade House (pictured below) on the Parade is an 18th-century, grade II listed building. The Georgian house was originally an inn. The three-storey building has a hipped slate roof. North Parade House (pictured below) at 12 North Parade is a late-18th-century, grade II listed building. It is also located on the Parade or North Parade, the segment of Monk Street north of New Dixton Road and Priory Street. The three-storey, three-bay house has a Welsh slate roof. The entrance features a radiating fanlight. The back of the property is remarkable for a large walled garden. The property was at one point the home of a wool merchant. The garage was formerly his warehouse, and the four adjacent cottages (pictured below) had provided housing for his workers. The house is located opposite the gatehouse of the Monmouth County Gaol. The Monmouth County Gaol (pictured below), or The Old Gaol, is a listed building. It was designed by William Blackburn and built 1788–1790. It closed in 1869 due to the increase in size of the gaol in Usk. Constructed of Old Red Sandstone, the current house is the surviving remnant of the County Gaol, and was its gatehouse. It is located opposite the North Parade House. The former Cottage Hospital (pictured below) is an early-20th-century, listed building. It was designed by London architect Richard Creed and built in 1902. It was built on the site of the former gaol. It also has a Hereford Road address.

The original building was erected on Monbijou Park in 1885, but during the Second World War was destroyed in allied bombings. The original site on Oranienburger Straße happened to be in what had become the Soviet sector of Berlin in 1945 and was therefore abandoned and the ruins removed in 1949. In 1950 the congregation built a new church on the corner of Preußenallee and Badenallee in Neu-Westend, part of the Westend locality of Berlin in the British sector. The church served as the garrison church of the British Army during the Allied occupation, and reverted to civilian control in 1994. History There had been Anglican worship in Berlin since at least 1830. From 1855 the Anglican congregation used a gatehouse at Monbijou Palace as the English Chapel. The chapel soon became too small for the services of the congregation, regularly attended by Princess Royal Victoria, Crown Princess of Prussia and the German Empire.\\"St. George's Anglican Church\\", on: Preussen.de, retrieved on 14 May 2012 In 1883 Crown Prince Frederick William and Victoria provided a site in the park of Monbijou Palace close to Monbijoustraße and the Domkandidatenstift. Julius Carl Raschdorff, who would later design Berlin's Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church, was commissioned to develop the plans for a church in close collaboration with Crown Princess Victoria and was sent to England on a study tour. The old St. George's Church The church was built under the patronage of Crown Princess Victoria.\\"About us\\", on: St George's Anglican Episcopal Church, Berlin, retrieved on 14 May 2012. The cornerstone was laid on 24 May 1884, Queen Victoria's birthday. The construction was financed through donations to the royal couple on the occasion of their silver wedding, with provision for a minister. The church was built of Silesian granite and glacial erratics, covered with a patterned slate roof cladding. British relatives of the princess donated the stained- glass windows. The church, seating 300, was inaugurated on 19 November 1885. The Kings of Prussia, who were also German Emperors, were the church's patrons. On their visits to Berlin, Queen Victoria and King George V visited the church in 1888 and 1913, respectively. During World War I it was the only Anglican Church in Germany which was allowed to remain open, thanks to William II who was then its patron. Plaque for the Grüber Bureau and its family school, opened 1939 for pupils expelled from state schools due to their Jewish descent After the war the congregation developed not only for Britons but also for American, German, Indian, Chinese, Finnish and Russian Christians. In 1921 Charles Andrew Schönberger came to Germany and opened a branch of the Anglican Hebrew Christian Testimony to Israel in Berlin, opposite St. George's on Oranienburger Straße 20/21.In 1893 David Baron and Schönberger (1841–1924, died in Berlin) had founded the Hebrew Christian Testimony to Israel in London. In 1973 the Hebrew Christian Testimony to Israel merged with other missionary societies to form the Messianic Testimony. A number of proselytes among the Jews of Berlin joined the Anglican congregation. When the Nazi persecution of Jews and even Jewish-born Christians (see Prussian Union of Churches § Protestants of Jewish descent) became more and more unbearable, the Hebrew Christian Testimony to Israel relinquished its premises on Oranienburger Straße to Heinrich Grüber's help organisation, , on 7 December 1938.Hartmut Ludwig, \\"Das ›Büro Pfarrer Grüber‹ 1938–1940\\", in: ›Büro Pfarrer Grüber‹ Evangelische Hilfsstelle für ehemals Rasseverfolgte.

St. George's, which was closed after the outbreak of the Second World War, was hit by allied bombing in 1943 and 1944. The ruins of the church, which after 1945 was in the Soviet Sector of Berlin, were later demolished by the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The new St. George's Church Entrance at the southern gable end of St. George's Church After the war, the congregation consisted mostly of members of the British forces and administration stationed in Berlin. In 1950, a new St. George's Church was built by Korth and Stevens in the Neu-Westend neighbourhood in the British Sector as the garrison church of the British forces. From 1945 to 1954 the Lutheran congregation of Melanchthon Church on Wilhelmstraße, close to the Smuts Barracks, also hosted the British garrison church community. The pews of St. George's still bear the insignia of the British regiments once garrisoned in Berlin. In 1987 the original church silver, donated by Crown Princess Victoria, was discovered in a city cellar and has since been used for weekly worship. Since the British forces withdrew from Berlin in 1994, the church has been used by civilians.

The second son of Anaxandridas II, he was the younger half-brother of Cleomenes I and the elder full brother of both Leonidas I and Cleombrotus. He tried to found a colony in Libya but failed. He tried again to establish a colony in western Sicily, but was killed by the Carthaginians. Family According to Herodotus, Anaxandridas II of Sparta had married his niece and was devoted to her. For a long time, the marriage was childless and Sparta's Council of the Ephors, fearing that the line of Eurysthenes would expire, asked Anaxandridas to divorce his wife and remarry. Anaxandridas refused and the Ephors then proposed that he take a second wife, even though bigamy was hitherto unknown in Sparta. Anaxandridas agreed and, shortly after his second marriage, both of his wives became pregnant. Cleomenes, who was the only child of the second wife, was the first-born. Dorieus was born to the first wife a few months later and she then had Leonidas and Cleombrotus, who may have been twins, in the following year.Herodotus, pp. 354–355.Bury and Meiggs, pp. 135–136. When Anaxandridas died, the Council named Cleomenes as his successor because he was the eldest son. Dorieus challenged the decision but was over-ruled even though, Herodotus says, he was the finest young man of his generation whereas Cleomenes was not right in his head and was on the verge of madness.Herodotus, p. 355.Bury and Meiggs, p. 136. Colonies Dorieus asked the Council to select a body of men who would help him to found a settlement elsewhere. Herodotus says he went off in a fit of temper to Libya and made the grave mistake of not consulting the Delphic Oracle beforehand. A colony was established at Cinyps in the Tripolitania region of modern-day Libya. Three years later, the Greeks were driven out by a Libyan tribe called the Macae who were allied to the Carthaginians.Speake, p. 217. Dorieus returned to Sparta but soon heard about land in western Sicily which, he was advised, rightly belonged to the Heracleidae, from whom his family claimed descent. This time, Dorieus did consult the Oracle and was told the land was his for the taking so, having re- assembled his followers, he set sail for Sicily. It happened that war was about to break out between the Magna Graecia cities of Croton and Sybaris in the south of Italy. Croton asked Dorieus for help. He agreed and was involved in the attack by Croton on Sybaris.Herodotus, p. 356. He then progressed with project to establish a Greek colony at Eryx in Sicily. However, not longer after establishing the colony named Herakleia, Dorieus and most of his followers were defeated and killed by the Egestaeans with the support of the Carthaginians.Diodorus, iv. 23 § 3.Fischer-Hansen, Nielsen, Ampolo, in Hansen, Inventory, pp. 197. Bury and Meiggs assert that Dorieus was killed c. 510 BC. The remnant of the colonists then went on the southern coast of Sicily and captured Herakleia Minoa.Fischer-Hansen, Nielsen, Ampolo, in Hansen, Inventory, pp. 196. Herodotus points out that if Dorieus had remained in Sparta and had endured living under the kingship of Cleomenes, he would have eventually succeeded him as king of Sparta, as Cleomenes had no sons. Instead it was Dorieus' younger brother Leonidas who succeeded Cleomenes as king and assumed the mantle of an heroic figure by his deeds in the Persian Wars.Herodotus, p. 357.

The Insurgents bodies incident is an incident involving American soldiers and Afghan policemen who posed with body parts of dead insurgents during the War in Afghanistan. Los Angeles Times report On April 18, 2012 the Los Angeles Times released photos of U.S. soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division posing with body parts of dead insurgents, after a soldier in the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division gave the photos to the LA Times to draw attention to \\"a breakdown in security, discipline and professionalism\\" among U.S. troops operating in Afghanistan. The incident involved a paratrooper platoon from the 82nd Airborne Division which was charged with two missions which involved the inspecting and identifying of the remains of insurgent suicide bombers. The first mission occurred in Afghanistan's Zabol province in February 2010. The platoon went to a police station in the provincial capital of Qalat where the Afghan police kept the mangled remains of a person whose legs were severed. The paratroopers were told by the police that the severed legs belonged to a suicide bomber whose explosives detonated as he tried to attack a police unit. Posing with members of the Afghan police some paratroopers held the corpse's severed legs. The second mission led the platoon to the morgue in Qalat in late April or early May 2010 according to the Los Angeles Times. Here the paratroopers should identify three insurgents whose explosives had detonated accidentally as they were preparing a roadside bomb according to Afghan police. The soldiers obtained a few fingerprints and then posed grinning and mugging for photographs next to the remains. The Los Angeles Times reports: \\"Two soldiers posed holding a dead man's hand with the middle finger raised. A soldier leaned over the bearded corpse while clutching the man's hand. Someone placed an unofficial platoon patch reading \\"Zombie Hunter\\" next to other remains and took a picture.\\" Reactions =American= The Los Angeles Times showed copies of the whole 18 photos to the U.S. Army which launched an investigation into the incident. Army spokesman George Wright said that posing with corpses for photographs outside of officially sanctioned purposes is a violation of Army standards. \\"Such actions fall short of what we expect of our uniformed service members in deployed areas.\\" according to Wright, who also said that after the end of the investigation the Army would \\"take appropriate action\\" against the involved persons. U.S. Army spokeswoman LTC Margaret Kageleiry told the L.A. Times that most of the soldiers which are seen on the photos have been identified. U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta called the soldiers behaviour unacceptable, promised a full investigation and said about the soldiers behaviour in comparison to the U.S. armed forces in general: \\"This is not who we are, and it's certainly not what we represent when it comes to the great majority of men and women in uniform.\\" The actions of the soldiers were condemned by General John Allen, commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF). US Ambassador to Afghanistan Ryan Crocker said: \\"The actions were morally repugnant, dishonor the sacrifices of hundreds of thousands of U.S. soldiers and civilians who have served with distinction in Afghanistan, and do not represent the core values of the United States or our military.\\" The New York Times reported that according to White House sources President Obama called for an investigation of the matter and said that those responsible would be held accountable. =Afghan= Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid called the pictures disrespectful, and condemned both the U.S. soldiers involved in the pictures as well as the Afghan police also featured in them. \\"We strongly condemn these occupiers and their puppets who are without culture, who are brutal and inhumane,\\" Mujahid said. \\"Next to these occupiers there are some Afghans—puppets—who were ordered to stand next to the bodies of the martyrs.\\" Afghan President Hamid Karzai said that it is \\"a disgusting act to take photos with body parts and then share it with others\\". As of 19 April 2012, there has been no news of mass protests by the Afghan people such as after the Quran burnings in February 2012, which Afghan lawmakers ascribe to the Afghan people's lack of sympathy for suicide bombers. Mohammad Naim Lalai Hamidzai, a parliamentarian from southern Kandahar, told the Associated Press that \\"the people of Afghanistan remember the killing of innocent people by suicide bombers and people do not have a good image of these suicide bombers. The burning of Qurans and the killing of children create emotions in people, but there is no sympathy for suicide bombers who kill innocent people.\\" Another reason for the muted reaction in Afghanistan was that evening TV bulletins did not show the photos, and that many ordinary Afghans have no internet access.

The Australian government soon afterwards deported him back to the United States, and after six years of fruitless efforts aimed at finding another country to which he could be admitted as a refugee, Slater asked the State Department to reverse its earlier recognition of his renunciation, and had his U.S. citizenship restored. Renunciation of citizenship In December 1987, Slater appeared before the U.S. consul in Perth, Australia and renounced his citizenship; the State Department confirmed his renunciation and issued him with a Certificate of Loss of Nationality. At the time, roughly 300 Americans renounced their citizenship each year, but typically as part of the process of obtaining citizenship elsewhere. Slater had plans to marry an Australian woman and eventually obtain Australian citizenship through her, but that fell through, leaving him stateless. Slater's only travel document was a World Passport issued by Garry Davis' World Service Authority. He stated that he renounced his citizenship in protest of the foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration, in particular the 1986 bombing of Libya. He was quoted as saying, \\"I'm sick and tired of the United States. It's like belonging to a country club where you don't like the way the directors are behaving, and you cancel your membership.\\" Travels as a refugee Australia deported Slater after his United States passport was revoked; he was readmitted to the U.S. on a humanitarian parole, which he stated that he did not want. Slater then made various attempts to find another country which would admit him for settlement, going back and forth into Mexico and at one point even hitchhiking across Canada to Newfoundland and then taking a ferry to the nearby French overseas territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon in an effort to gain admission there. He chose a French territory as a destination because France was a signatory to the Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons. However, the territorial prefect at the time would not permit him to remain. His Canadian lawyer Gary Botting was quoted as stating that there was a \\"mini riot ... [s]everal fishermen went on a rampage\\". Return to the United States Slater returned to the United States, but his earlier work authorization had expired due to his departure, and his Social Security Number was no longer valid. By March 1991, after his return to the U.S. he was living in an abandoned building near the railroad tracks in Tucson, Arizona. He expressed interest in going to Norway, but the government there stated that he could not be admitted without a job. The U.S. also refused to issue him a refugee travel document. Slater referred to his situation as \\"internal exile\\". In 1991, the U.S. Department of State stated that Slater could request his citizenship back, but Slater stated that he was not interested. Despite all his migration difficulties, in a 1992 interview he stated that he had no regrets, comparing his actions to those taken by Sons of Liberty in the Boston Tea Party. By late 1992, he was quoted by the Santa Barbara News-Press as stating that he hoped Bill Clinton could restore his U.S. citizenship by executive order. He regained U.S. citizenship in 1993. Family and personal life Slater was born in Waterloo, Iowa to Jerry L. Slater, Sr. and Shirley M. Rodery Slater. He had a sister Debra Slater, a younger brother Jerry L. Slater, Jr., and another brother who died as an infant. Slater's mother later married Robert G. Papach, also of Waterloo, with whom she had a son James, Slater's half brother; she died in 1999. Slater's brother Jerry lived in Moscow, Iowa; he died in 2006. Slater himself died at his home in Pocatello, Idaho on March 26, 2008, where his body was found five days later. He was survived by his son Trent, two daughters Nancy and Christine, and his father Jerry, sister Debra, and half-brother James.

ACC is extremely unstable under normal conditions and is found naturally in taxa as wide-ranging as sea urchins, corals, mollusks, and foraminifera. It is usually found as a monohydrate, holding the chemical formula CaCO3·H2O; however, it can also exist in a dehydrated state, CaCO3. ACC has been known to science for over 100 years when a non-diffraction pattern of calcium carbonate was discovered by Sturcke Herman, exhibiting its poorly-ordered nature. ACC is an example of crystallization by particle attachment (CPA), where crystals form via the addition of particles ranging from multi-ion complexes to fully formed nanocrystals. Research of such systems have diverse application; however, the current lack unambiguous answers to fundamental questions (i.e. solubility product, interfacial forces, structure, etc.) causes them to be topics of study in fields ranging from chemistry, geology, biology, physics, and materials science engineering. Stability ACC is the sixth and least stable polymorph of calcium carbonate. The remaining five polymorphs (in decreasing stability) are: calcite, aragonite, vaterite, monohydrocalcite and ikaite. When mixing two supersaturated solutions of calcium chloride and sodium carbonate (or sodium bicarbonates) these polymorphs will precipitate from solution following Ostwald's step rule, which states that the least stable polymorph will precipitate first. But while ACC is the first product to precipitate, it rapidly transforms into one of the more stable polymorphs within seconds. When in pure CaCO3, ACC transforms within seconds into one of the crystalline calcium carbonate polymorphs. This transformation from amorphous to crystalline is proposed to be a dissolution-reprecipitation mechanism. Despite ACC's highly unstable nature, some organisms are able to produce stable ACC. For example, the American Lobster Homarus americanus, maintains stable ACC throughout its yearly molt cycle. Studies of biogenic ACC have also shown that these stable forms of ACC are hydrated whereas the transient forms are not. From observations of spicule growth in sea urchins, it seems that ACC is deposited at the location of new mineral growth where it then dehydrates and transforms into calcite. In biology Several organisms have developed methods to stabilize ACC by using specialized proteins for various purposes. The function of ACC in these species is inferred to be for the storage/transport of materials for biomineralization or enhancement of physical properties, but the validity of such inferences has yet to be determined. Earthworms, some bivalves species, and some gastropods species are known to produce very stable ACC. ACC is widely used by crustaceans to stiffen the exoskeleton as well as to store calcium in gastroliths during the molt cycle. Here, the benefit of utilizing ACC may not be for physical strength, but for its periodic need of the exoskeleton to be dissolved for molting. Sea urchins and their larvae utilize the transient form of ACC when forming spicules. The new material, a hydrated form of ACC, for the spicule is transported and deposited at the outer edges of the spicule. Then the deposited material, ACC·H2O, rapidly dehydrates to ACC. Following the dehydration, within 24 hours, all of the ACC will have transformed into calcite. Synthetic ACC Many methods, have been devised for synthetically producing ACC since its discovery at 1989, however, only few syntheses successfully stabilized ACC for more than several weeks. The best effective method to stabilize ACC lifetime is by forming it in the presence of magnesium and/or phosphorus. Also, ACC crystallisation pathways have been observed to depend on its Mg/Ca ratio, transforming to aragonite, Mg-calcite, monohydrocalcite or dolomite with increasing Mg content. Huang et al. managed to stabilize ACC using polyacrylic acid for several months, while Loste et al. showed that magnesium ions can increase ACC stability as well. But only the discovery that aspartic acid, glycine, citrate, and phosphorylated amino acids can produce long term stable ACC have opened the door for production commercialization. Highly porous ACC Highly porous ACC has been synthesized using a surfactant-free method. In this method CaO is dispersed in methanol under a pressure of carbon dioxide in a sealed reaction vessel. ACC with surface area over 350 m2/g was synthesized using this method. Highly porous ACC appeared to be made up aggregated nanoparticles with dimensions less than 10 nm in size. Highly porous ACC was also found to be stable in ambient conditions for up to 3 weeks with most of its porosity retained. Applications and uses Bioavailability: Since 2013 a company named Amorphical Ltd. sells an ACC dietary supplement.The dietary supplement \\"DENSITY\\" homepage סידן, הדור הבא: התוסף שמצליח לבנות עצם מחדש Hebrew article on Ynet about the new calcium dietary supplement, December 2013 Calcium carbonate is being used as a calcium supplement worldwide, however, it is known that its bioavailability is very low, only around 20–30%. ACC is roughly 40% more bioavailable than crystalline calcium carbonate. Drug delivery: Due to the ability to tune the size and morphology of the amorphous calcium carbonate particles (as well as other calcium carbonate particles), they have huge applications in drug delivery systems. Highly porous ACC showed the ability to stabilize poorly soluble drug molecules in its extensive pore system and could also enhance the drug release rates of these drugs. Paleoclimate reconstruction: A better understanding of the transformation process from amorphous to crystalline calcium carbonate will improve reconstructions of past climates that use chemical and biological proxies. For example, the calibrations of the clumped 13C-18O carbonate paleothermometer and understanding the origins and evolution of skeletal structures. Environmental remediation: Improving environmental remediation efforts through gaining insight into the roles of earth materials in biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and metals through better understandings of the properties of environmental mineral phases involved in elemental uptake and release. Material science: Improving nanomaterials design and synthesis such as improving photovoltaic, photocatalytic, and thermoelectric materials for energy applications or improving biomedical cementations. Also improving framework material development for CO2 capture, H2 storage, emissions control, biomass conversion, molecular separations, and biofuel purification.

Career After his father's death in 1748, he inherited the large family cloth business in Exeter. Together with his younger brother Francis, he extended his commercial interests to London by setting up the partnership of John and Francis Baring, of which he was the senior partner. He soon retired from activity in London to concentrate on business in Devon, and left the running of the London business to Francis, under whose guidance it evolved into Barings Bank. Back in Devon, Baring founded banks in Plymouth and Exeter and entered politics. Having unsuccessfully contested Honiton, he was elected Member of Parliament for Exeter in 1776. Baring Crescent, Exeter, developed with Regency villas 1818-1828, was named after the family. He was also appointed Sheriff of Devon for 1776. He retired from Parliament in 1802.

Since the beginning of 2011 large protests against such mining and hydroelectric projects have been held by the indigenous inhabitants of Panama. This wikipedia article will deal with the context of these protests.  History  The hydroelectric potential of the Bocas del Torro region was discovered in the 1970s. However, the first 70 hydroelectric power plants were built in 1998 after the privatization of Panama’s Institute of Hydroelectric Resources and Electrification (IRHE).Finley-Brook and Thomas 2011, 866 For the approval of following hydroelectric projects the Panamanian government and private investors negotiated, in accordance with Law 127, with the indigenous representatives.Finley-Brook and Thomas 2011, 866 Corruption, involuntary resettlement of the villages, and penetration of the local politics by the Panamanian government, however, led to the first protests against hydroelectric power plants and mining in the 90's.Finley-Brook and Thomas 2011, 867 Recently these protests received more attention. On the 11th of February 2011 the government of Ricardo Martinelli approved the neo-liberal Law 8, also known as the Ley Minera, which made it possible for foreign companies to invest directly in Panamanian concessions.La Estrella 11/02/2011 This resulted, during the months of February, March, and May 2011, in large protests by the native Ngäbe Buglé people who felt the threat of Hydrologic ColonialismFinley-Brooke and Thomas 2011, 864 which would affect their political authority in the comarca and destruct the environment.La Estrella 11/02/2011 The start of hydroelectric projects in the comarca and the annexed regions in early January 2012 led to large scale indigenous protests and the blocking of the Inter-American Highway. On the 5th of February 2012 the indigenous people from the north-western part of Panama clashed with the riot police while blocking the Pan-American Highway near San Felix.La Prensa 05/02/2012 On this day 150 Ngäbe Buglé were arrested and 40 got injured, of which three persons died within a week. The repression of the protests by the police seems to be a form of green authoritarianism,Finley-Brook and Thomas 2011, 866 which stands for the involvement of the state to secure and protect renewable energy sources and “market valorized ecological processes”.Finley- Brook and Thomas 2011, 866 However, this does not only happen with the use of explicit violence as is the case here. The increasing influence of the national government in the native political elections, which occurs in Panama since 2010 by changing the Carta Organica, is also a hidden form of green authoritarianism.Simms and Moolji 2011, 29 0n the 7th of February, 2 days after the conflict between the police and the indigenous people, the San Lorenzo treaty was signed, of which the most important points hold that:San Lorenzo Treaty (a.) the government would participate in a discussion with the Ngäbe Buglé on the new Ley Minera and the hydroelectric projects with the Catholic church as mediator between the two parties, (b.) the Ngäbe Buglé would cease their blockade and the riot police would withdrawal, (c.) cellular communication would be restored, (d.) the 150 captured protesters would be released, and (e.) the families of killed Ngäbe Buglé would be compensated. During February the Panamerican Highway was closed several times again in the North-Western part of the country due to continuing protests of the Ngäbe Buglé. At the same time the dialogue between representatives of the state and the Ngäbe Buglé continued in Panama City. The Ngäbe Buglé people were represented by their officially elected general cacique Silvia Carrera. Division in the Ngäbe-Buglé politics, however, caused that not all agreed with the leadership on Carrera which led to smaller protests in parts of the Ngäbe Buglé region.  Legal Issues  It seems that the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which was ratified by Panama in 2007,U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous people 2007, Article 32 is in conflict with the in 2011 approved Law 8. The U.N. Declaration of Rights of Indigenous PeoplesU.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous people 2007, Article 32 holds that “states shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their lands or territories and other resources, particularly in connection with the development, utilization, or exploitation of their mineral, water, or other resources”. Law 8, however, holds thatSimms and Moolji 2011, 14 “[f]oreign state-owned mining companies are allowed to invest directly in Panamanian concessions”. This means that foreign companies are able to undertake large mining projects on Panamanian terrain, including the land within the comarcas, without consultation of the indigenous inhabitants. This in itself is in conflict with article 127 of the Panamanian constitution, which deals with the comarca structure as will be explained below. It seems as if the increasing laws for the protection of indigenous rights and the laws for trade liberalization are conflicting commitments.Simms and Moolji 2011, 14  The Comarca Ngöbe Buglé  The Comarca Ngöbe Buglé was founded in 1997 with the approval of Law 10.Simms and Moolji 2011, 23 The comarca structure is borrowed from the Kuna comarca system and follows a similar political organization which is accepted as legitimate by the Panamanian government.Simms and Moolji 2011, 23 Article 127 of the Panamanian constitution states that the Government will guarantee the indigenous communities the grounds and the collective property in order to accomplish their economic and social wealth. The Law will regulate the procedures for these land delimitations, in which private land ownership is prohibited.Constitución Política de la República de Panamá 2004 According to Article 48 and 57 of CH II of the Carta Organica the indigenous authorities need to approve any projects of environmental exploitation by submitting them to a referendum.Simms and Moolji 2011, 42  Current Developments  After months of protests, street blockades, and negotiations with the United Nations as mediator between the two parties, president Martinelli finally repealed Law 8 on the 3rd of March 2012.La Prensa 22/03/2012 This was followed by the approval of the new Law 415 which ensured that mining is banned from the comarca. This decision resulted in the cancellation of 25 pending mining requests in the Ngäbe-Buglé region.Mineweb.com The new Law stresses that hydroelectric projects may only be constructed after the approval of, and in collaboration with, the natives. In reaction to the approval of the new law, general cacique Silvia Carrera apologized for the street closures and the many demonstrations. Though the indigenous negotiators are satisfied with the results, others feel defeated as hydroelectric projects are still not totally banned from the region.Mineweb.com Notes  References  *Constitución Política de la República de Panamá 2004, Gaceta Oficial No. 25, 176, Año CI Panamá, R.

It grows between 1000 and 4000 m on dunite rocks, among stones and slopes, and is now distributed in the temperate and subtropical regions of the world, chiefly in Western Asia (Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Azerbaijan, Armenia) to Afghanistan and Pakistan and also in ladakh(Kargil) region of India. The Syrian rhubarb is a partially commercial vegetable collected from the nature in Eastern and Southern Anatolia, Northern Iraq and partly Northwestern Iran in early spring. Rheum ribes is considered as a valuable medicinal species in herbal medicine.  Description  The Syrian rhubarb is a dichotomously branched perennial stout herb, up to 1 m tall. It has thick perennial rhizomes, large annual bean- shaped reddish-green leaves with stalks, edible flower stalks, small yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, three-sided ovate-oblong achenes and broad red- winged dull brown fruit.Önder Türkmen, Mustafa Çirka and Suat Şensoy (2005), Initial Evaluation of a New Edible Wild Rhubarb Species (Rheum ribes L.) with a Modified Weighted Scaling Index Method, Pakistan Journal of Biological Sciences 8 (5): 763-765, 2005 The flowering stem (peduncle) is solid, warty, leafy below, leafless above.Van Herbaryumu = Similar species = It is very similar to the species Rheum palaestinum, being distinguished by having five central leaf veins as opposed to three, and being taller. Agnia Losina- Losinskaja considered it very similar in leaves and flowers to R. maximowiczii from further north in Central Asia, but to be distinguished from it by its much rougher stem, much longer leaf petioles and broader inflorescence. R. maximowiczii furthermore has three veins per leaf. = Karyotypy = R. ribes has a chromosome count of 2n=44.  Taxonomy  Rheum ribes was first formally described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus. It was one of three species of Rheum described in Species Plantarum volume 1. Linnaeus referred to five earlier authors who had described the plant: Johann Jacob Dillenius, Jacob Breyne (who calls it a Lapathum, known as Ribes arabicum), Richard Pococke (who published in 1745 a description of his travels in the Near East and who brought seeds to England from Lebanon), Leonhard Rauwolf and Gaspard Bauhin. In 1936 Losina- Losinskaja, in Komarov's Flora SSSR, classifies this species in section Ribesiformia, in which she also places R. maximowiczii, R. fedtschenkoi, R. cordatum, R. hissaricum and R. macrocarpum (and R. lobatum and R. plicatum, which are both now seen as synonyms of R. macrocarpum). History This plant is first mentioned in Europe in the Arabic work, in English called the Book of Simple Medicaments, by Serapion the Younger, the Latin translation of which circulated throughout Europe in the late 13th to 15th century. Serapion says the plant is used to make the medicine thenceforth known in Europe as rob ribes. In Europe, herbalists initially thought he was describing a currant, which they then used to make local, lesser ribes. One of the first European works to write about this plant unambiguously was the Viertes Kreutterbuech - darein vil schoene und frembde Kreutter of 1576 by Leonhard Rauwolf, the first modern European botanist to travel through the Levant and Mesopotamia. The Viertes Kreutterbuech is one of the first herbaria – the first with plants collected outside of Europe – and contains Rauwolf's notes on the pressed plants displayed. Rauwolf calls the plant Ribes arabum and saw it growing in Lebanon and Palestine. He says the rob ribes of Serapion is made from the young flowering stalk. In the 1623 Pinax Theatri Botanici, Gaspard Bauhin attempts to sort all the plant names hitherto published. In this work he organises all Grossularia and Ribes species known at the time into 13 species, the twelfth of which is Rheum ribes, which Bauhin calls Ribes arabicum. Bauhin bases this on the work of Rauwolf, but also Clusius (who calls it Ribes legitima arabum), Camerarius (Ribes serapionis), Rembert Dodoens (Ribes serapionis foliis oxylapathi) and Pierre Belon. In 1732, Johann Jacob Dillenius published his Hortus Elthamensis – a book of rare plants grown in London – which describes this plant. He calls it a type of Lapathum (now Rumex), but mentions that it is known as Ribes arabicum. Dillenius obtained seeds in 1726 from William Sherard, who brought them from Lebanon in 1724. He mentions that it was only grown elsewhere in Europe in Leyden, from an older source. The specific epithet ribes is thus derived via Serapion from the Arabic word rībās (ريباس), referring to the Syrian rhubarb. Flora Hibernica (1836) (Name, Ribes, a word applied by the Arabic Physicians to a species of Rhubarb, Rheum Ribes.) The New Latin word ribes (currant) was corrupted from the Arabic word rībās by Europeans in the Renaissance, possibly due confusion with the original description of the bunches of berries on its panicle of fruit, with currants, a new crop at the time. R. ribes, unlike many other species of rhubarb, has a fleshy, succulent epicarp around its seeds. The generic name Rheum is derived from the Greek rheon, mentioned by Dioscorides as a name for medicinal rhubarb; the word rheon is itself thought to be derived from the (old) Persian rewend, which possibly referred to this species.  Distribution  It is native to Israel (only in the occupied Golan Heights),Wild Flowers of Israel Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Azerbaijan (including Nakhichevan), Armenia (as of 2011), Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Russia.  Ecology  Rheum ribes in early May in situ at Karasakal Mt., Tufanbeyli, near Adana, Turkey. = Habitat = It is a floristic element of the Irano-Turanian Region or Iran-Turan Plant Geography Region. It is found in eastern Turkey on dry mountain slopes at 1600-2600m elevation in association with the plants Prangos ferulacea and Cousinia sivasica with which it forms the dominant flora such ecosystems. In Israel it is found on rocky slopes and cliffs in the transition zone of montane forests of Quercus boissieri. = Insects = Rheum ribes is the main food plant of a tiny hairstreak butterfly, Callophrys mystaphia, of which the Turkish name is ışgınzümrütü, the 'rhubarb emerald', in Adiyaman, Hakkâri, Iğdır, Kahramanmaraş, Kars, Siirt and Van provinces in southeastern and eastern Turkey.TRAKEL (Türkiye'nin Anonim Kelebekleri)Van Gölü Havzasında Kelebek Çeşitliliği (Diversity of the butterflies in Van Lake Basin East Turkey) by Muhabbet Kemal, 2008 This butterfly had not been seen since its description in 1913 (it turned out that the butterflies identified under this name in the former Soviet territories were in fact a different species), but in 2007–2008 it was rediscovered and its host plant was found. This animal has a distribution closely localised to Rheum populations, and has only been found in Turkey. R. ribes leaves are the food plant of the moth Xylena exsoleta in Van Province, Turkey.Muhabbet Kemal, Halil Özkol & Lokman Kayci (2008), Xylena Ochsenheimer in East Turkey with new provincial records and larval food-plants (Noctuidae, Lepidoptera), in Miscellaneous Papers, Centre for Entomological Studies Ankara, no: 139-140, 20.03.2008 Beetles associated with R. ribes in eastern Turkey are a Petrocladus sp. weevil, the jewel beetle Capnodis marquardti, and the leaf beetle Labidostomis brevipennis. These are all specialised herbivores of the plant, and most appear endemic to Turkey as far as known. L. brevipennis lays its eggs on the leaves.  Cooking  Immature inflorescences for sale at the historical market in Kadıköy, Istanbul, Turkey. The edible part of the plant is the flowering stem, which is eaten raw or cooked (ekşili ışgınElazığ Cuisine and ışkınlı yumurta [lit.

Traditional and current medicinal uses  Rheum ribes is the source of one of the most important crude drugs in West Asiatic regions. These plant vitamins A, B, C are seen in abundance.

It was taken by the Saxons in the late-6th century and, by the end of the 9th century, it had become one of the most important Anglo-Saxon burhs in Dorset. The burhs were defensive sites created by King Alfred and his son Edward to defend the borders of the kingdom of Wessex, although the work at Wareham may potentially have built on existing defences. The defences encompassed a rectangular area, up to in size. It took the form of an earthwork bank with a protective ditch, topped by timber-faced ramparts, approximately long on the west side, along the north and on the eastern side - the length of the southern edge along the river are unknown.; Four entrances to the town were built, one on each side. Probably at the end of the 10th century, or the beginning of the 11th century, the timber facings were replaced with stone. A system of taxes was established to support the burhs and in the Burghal Hidage record that survives from the reign of Edward shows that 1,600 hides - an area of land - were allocated for Wareham, sufficient to maintain 2,200 yards of ramparts.; 12th-16th centuries Wareham Castle was built in the south-west corner of the old Anglo-Saxon earthworks, taking the form of a motte with an inner and outer bailey, protected with timber defences and a ditch.; The original size of the motte is not known; 18th and 19th century records suggest it was between across.; It is uncertain when the castle was built; it may have been constructed soon after the Norman conquest in 1066, although no physical evidence survives today to prove this theory.; If the castle was built soon after 1066, the construction work may have required the extensive demolition of houses in that part of the town, and the decision to place it in the south-west sector may have been linked to the presence of a former Anglo-Saxon royal residence there. Robert Beaumont controlled the castle in 1188, when he passed it onto Robert, Earl of Gloucester, who carried out work on it in 1137. A small, square keep across with pilaster butressses at the corners, was built from stone rubble on the top of the motte, probably at the beginning of the 12th century.; The bailey was protected by a stone curtain wall, known to have been thick in places. During the civil conflict known as the Anarchy in the 1140s, Wareham Castle lay on the border between the territories of the rival claimants for the throne, Stephen and the Empress Matilda, and the location of the regional mint. Robert was a supporter of Matilda, and the castle exchanged hands between him and Stephen several times in the next few years, with the town being possibly burnt by Stephen. By the end of the fighting, nearby Corfe Castle had taken over as the most important military fortification in the region. After 1154 and the end of the civil war, the castle was controlled by the earls of Gloucester. The town's economy stagnated during the late 12th and 13th centuries, although in 1207 the castle, which had been confiscated by King John, was repaired and used by the monarch as a stopping point on the way to Corfe Castle.; After John, Wareham passed to the Earls of Clare, who paid it little attention, and the outer bailey ditch was filled in early in the 13th century. The river silted up and the port declined in importance, with trade focusing on Poole instead; by the 14th century, the town was in economic decline. 17th-21st centuries Depiction of the surviving castle and walls in 1888; red-dotted line shows the line of the castle's inner and outer baileys During the English Civil War of the 1640s, Wareham initially supported Parliament, and £60 was spent in 1642 improving the town walls.; The Royalists, under Sir Ralph Hopton, took the town in 1643, but Parliament retook it in 1644, when soldiers led by Sir Ashley Cooper forced their way through the West Gate in the walls.; ; The town wall was reinforced during the conflict, possibly with circular platforms positioned at key points. Parliament was advised that the defences remained useful and that they were too substantial to be slighted - deliberately damaged to put them beyond use. In 1685, seven men were executed for their part in the Monmouth Rebellion on the west bank of the defences, the section of which now carries the name of the \\"Bloody Bank\\".; It is not known when the castle was finally abandoned, but by the 18th century, buildings were encroaching on the eastern edge of the castle site, with the remainder forming an open area, known as Castle Green.; During the early 19th century, houses began to be built around the base of the motte, which was then enclosed in the late-19th century, with a villa called Castle Close was built on top of the motte in 1911. This required extensive changes to the shape of the motte, which is now in diameter, and across at the top. Most of the castle ditch was filled in, with the remaining elements across and deep.; The foundations of the keep still survive within the motte, and the lines of the inner and outer bailey are traced by the Pound and Trinity lanes.; It is not known when the stone from the Anglo-Saxon defences. Around 1850, a road was cut through part of the western town wall, and further alterations were made in 1940 during the Second World War to protect it against potential attacks by enemy tanks. In 1956, the town authorities took over management and conservation of the remaining walls. The Anglo-Saxon defences remain up to across and high in places, although the southern line along the river have been lost and only minimal parts of the eastern side remain; the south-eastern corner was destroyed at some point before the 18th century.; Early investigations into the Anglo-Saxon defences were undertaken in 1910, 1930 and 1951, and more substantial excavations were carried out on the Anglo-Saxon defence between 1952 and 1954. The remains of the castle and the town defences are protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.

Rainsford, an architect, designed many of the structures at the ranch. Horses bred at the ranch, mainly Morgans and Clydesdales, were widely known and sought after. The ranch was named after Rainsford's Diamond brand, one of the two oldest registered brands in Wyoming. Unlike most brands, which remain with the owner, the Diamond brand has remained with the property. The ranch features extensive barns for breeding and raising horses, as well as a more modest ranch house. In its prime there were formal gardens. History Although Rainsford established the ranch in 1878, it was not until 1880-1882 that temporary structures were built, with permanent buildings in 1885. Rainsford did not receive a patent for his lands until 1891, and then for only . The remainder was public land amounting to about , which Rainsford fenced. He was fined and forced to tear the fences down from 1905-1907, as an 1885 law prohibited the fencing of public lands. Although there were 3000 horses on the land in 1900, by 1920 they had declined to 200, and Rainsford sold his remaining stock to the U.S. Army and retired. His manager, Paul Raborg, bought the ranch in 1922, breeding polo ponies and raising dairy cattle. A scheme to feed the cattle on sunflower seeds led to the construction of large silos for storage. The plan failed and Raborg left when his marriage dissolved. His former wife's parents took over the ranch, with Maud Raborg's mother Dora Mae Oberman becoming sole owner on the death of her husband in 1937. Dora Mae Oberman expanded the ranch to before she died in 1956. In 1956 the ranch was sold to neighboring landowners Hugh and Rissa McDonald, who also owned the nearby Ned Foss Ranch. Their holdings amounted to by 1962. The McDonald's rented the Diamond Ranch buildings for use as a Methodist youth camp from the mid-1950s through 1965. The ranch passed from the McDonald's on their deaths in 1966 to their daughter and her husband, Ruth and John Braunschweig. In 1968 the ranch became a dude ranch and camping center associated with Kampgrounds of America. The barns were converted for guest use, with sleeping accommodations in the stud stalls and a dance floor in the main barn. Description Rainsford avoided traditional frontier architecture, using materials and forms more typical of eastern U.S. practices. The ranch buildings are substantial stone structures. The main barn, later the dance and dining hall, is an irregular stone structure varying from 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 stories with a mixture of hipped and gabled roofs. The complex encloses a sheltered courtyard with the main part of the barn set back into a hillside. The roofs are steeply pitched, lending the structures a lowered appearance that is characteristic of Rainsford's architecture. The ranch house is an irregularly shaped two-story structure with a variety of design elements. A stone bunkhouse and a stone bath building, formerly a storage building, complete the ensemble. The Diamond Ranch was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 28, 1984. It continues to function as a guest ranch.

The first Luftwaffe units to receive the bomber were Kampfgeschwader 153 (KG 153), and KG 155. Aufklärungsgruppe (F)/122, a reconnaissance unit, began converting to the Do 17 F-1. In early 1937, KG 255 was formed, also to be equipped with the Do 17 E-1.Goss 2005, p. 8. According to the Generalquartiermeister der Luftwaffe, 479 Do 17s were on strength. Some 100 more had been lost in crashes or sent to Spain.Nowarra 1990, p. 25. On 12 March 1938, Do 17Es of KG 155 dropped pro- Nazi leaflets on Vienna, as a prelude to the city's occupation during the German Anschluss operation.Hooton 2007 Vol. 1, p. 74.

On 1 May 1939, the Kampfgeschwader was redesignated Kampfgeschwader 2.de Zeng et al. Vol. 2 2007, p. 311. =Spanish Civil War= The Do 17's baptism of fire came during the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), where it outpaced most enemy fighters and performed well. The Spanish nicknamed the Dornier the Bacalao (\\"Codfish\\"). In early 1937, mass production began on the Do 17E and Do 17F series. The Do 17 F-1 was to replace the Heinkel He 70 as a high-flying fast reconnaissance aircraft, while the Do 17 E-1 was to supplant the Legion Condors aging Heinkel He 111B bomber.Goss 2005, p. 9. However, more modern Soviet-supplied Republican aircraft were capable of intercepting the E and F variants, which prompted an upgrade of the Dornier's defensive armament. Do 17E variant. A fleet of DFS 230 gliders can be seen in the background Among the units committed to Franco's cause was Hauptmann Rudolf Freiherr Von Moreau's 4.K/88. On 6 January 1937, it was decided by Erhard Milch, Albert Kesselring and Ernst Udet that the Legion should have more modern aircraft. Soon 12 Do 17 E-1s, as well as He 111B-1s and Ju 86D-1s were dispatched to serve in Spain. The unit was named VB/88 (Versuchsbomben Staffel, meaning Experimental Bomber Squadron).Hooton Vol. 1 2007, p. 54. VB/88s Dorniers were involved in a strike around Guernica, but that particular unit's objective was a bridge, rather than civilian areas. VB/88 dropped 8 tonnes (9 tons) of bombs, while K/88 added 37 tonnes (41 tons) over the city itself causing the deaths of about 1,500 people. The bombing of VB/88 straddled the bridge. The only other target hit by the German bombers that day was the rail station. On 8 July 1937, the Dorniers flew multiple sorties to protect Nationalist forces now threatening the capital, Madrid. At this point, the Junkers Ju 86s had been withdrawn and replaced by the Do 17Fs. In the spring of 1938, another unit, 1.A/88, equipped with Do 17s, also arrived in Spain. A total of 27 Do 17E, F and P variants were part of the Condor Legion.Griehl 2005, p. 14. =Polish Campaign= A series of new models introduced the new enlarged nose, greatly increasing defensive firepower, finally settling on the Z models, which were widely available by 1939. During the first phase of World War II, the Do 17, along with the He 111, formed the backbone of the Luftwaffes Kampfgruppen. From 1939 to 1940, four of the Luftwaffes bomber groups, KG 2, KG 3, KG 76 and KG 77 operated the Dornier. KG 76 and KG 77 operated the first generation Do 17E, with the other two Kampfgeschwader operating only the Do 17Z on the outbreak of war.de Zeng 2007 Vol 2, pp. 225, 228.Goss 2005, pp. 41, 49, 61.Green and Swanborough 1986, pp. 49-50. On 1 September 1939, 533 Dorniers and 705 Heinkels were combat-ready.Nowarra 1990, p. 36. The total strength of the Dornier force was approximately 100 Do 17 E-1s, 32 M-1s, 188 Z-1 and Z-2s as well as 213 P-1s.Nowarra 1990, p. 37. Its reliability and robustness made it highly popular in the Luftwaffe.Nowarra 1990, p. 28. During the campaign, Do 17s of I./KG 2 took part in the Battle of Bzura, in which they used incendiary bombs against Polish forces consisting of Army Poznań and Army Pomorze. These raids caused a huge number of Polish casualties, who by now had retreated to dense wooded areas, contributing to their vulnerability. The Do 17 had performed well and could use its speed to outrun Polish fighter aircraft under some circumstances.Hooton Vol. 1 2007, p. 91. =Norwegian Campaign= The only Do 17 unit known to have taken part in the Norwegian Campaign was the 1.(F)/120 (Aufklärungsgruppe) long-range reconnaissance unit. It operated from Lübeck/Blankensee, in northern Germany until the occupation of Denmark, and was then based at Stavanger on 10 April 1940, after the Wehrmacht had secured southern Norway. Equipped with the Do 17 P-1, it provided reconnaissance intelligence over the Norwegian coast and the North Sea.Smith 1967, p. 7. =Western Europe= The first German aircraft shot down over France during the war was a Dornier Do 17P of 2(F)123, brought down by Pilot Officer Mould's Hawker Hurricane of No. 1 Squadron RAF on 30 October 1939. The Dornier, Wrk Nr. 4414, constructed at Blohm & Voss, crashed near Vassincourt, killing all three of its crew, Hauptmann Balduin von Norman, Oberleutnant Hermann Heisterberg and Feldwebel Friedrich Pfeuffer.Goss 2005, p. 53. On 10 May the Dornier units, Kampfgeschwader 2, KG 3 and KG 4, were under the command of Fliegerkorps. II. Kampfgeschwader 76 and 77 also operated the Do 17 under Fliegerkorps I and Fliegerkorps VIII.Hooton 2007, p. 46. The Do 17 saw its usefulness diminish during the French campaign owing to its limited bomb load and range. The design continued to be favoured by the Luftwaffe aircrews, as it was more maneuverable than the He 111 or Ju 88, and because of its ability to perform low-level strikes well. An example of this was a raid carried out by KG 2 against the RAF-controlled airfield at Vraux on 10 May. Six Bristol Blenheims and two Fairey Battles of No. 114 Squadron RAF were destroyed, with many more damaged.Goss 2005, p. 48. However, Allied fighter resistance on the first day was severe, and KG 2 and KG 3 of Fliegerkorps II lost a total of nineteen Do 17s between them on 10 May.Hooton 2007, p. 63. Only two weeks into the campaign, KG 2 and 3 suffered fuel shortages, keeping the Dorniers grounded and forcing some attacks to be aborted.Hooton 2007, p. 69. By the beginning of June, the Dornier Geschwader were encountering less opposition and losses declined sharply, as the Armée de l'Air was no longer a sufficient threat. However, over Dunkirk, the RAF fighters inflicted a high loss rate. On 2 June, thirty German aircraft were destroyed, including sixteen Do 17s (four from KG 2 and twelve from KG 3). The Dornier units dropped some 320 tonnes (350 tons) of bombs.Hooton 2007, p. 73. =Battle of Britain= During the Polish campaign, the Do 17Z could use its 427 km/h (265 mph) maximum speed to stay away from most enemy fighters, and its light armament was effective. It also fought with success during the Battle of France and losses were relatively light, although when facing modern fighters like the Hawker Hurricane, the bomber proved slow in comparison and more vulnerable. When it faced British fighters during the Battle of Britain, it was shown that fast, well-armed monoplane fighters had changed the balance between bomber and fighter decidedly in favour of the latter. The Do 17 suffered in early raids. Do 17s over London, 7 September 1940 Since the Fafnir was a low-altitude engine, the Luftwaffe responded by employing the Do 17 units in a number of terrain-following mass raids in an attempt to evade fighter opposition. The Dornier was manoeuvrable in comparison to the Heinkel and the more robust nature of radial engines made it ideal for low-level attacks, with a number of units being fitted with 20 mm cannon. An example of one of these raids was the attack on RAF Kenley on 18 August, 1940, when nine aircraft from 9th Staffel of KG 76 led by Haupt. Joachim Roth, flew at very low altitude to avoid being detected by British radar and followed part of the London to Brighton railway to find their target. Four aircraft were destroyed in the attack and the remaining five were all damaged. At least one aircraft was lost to rocket propelled parachute and cable devices. Another was damaged by exploding bombs, due to the low altitude at which it was flying.The Hardest Day, The Battle of Britain, 18 August, 1940, Price, Alfred, Arms and Armour Press, 1988, pp 47-120 The Junkers Ju 88 was now entering service in larger numbers, replacing the Do 17 at higher altitudes. The Dornier excelled at low- level attacks. However, this was becoming more and more dangerous. The British were now firing rocket-powered parachutes into the path of low-flying aircraft and dragging them from the skies. Losses were considerable.Goss 2005, p. 66. Zehbe's Dornier falling on Victoria Station, 15 September 1940 Shoreham. The flame throwing device is just visible on the aft fuselage. The Do 17 was shot down by John Dundas and his wingman. The Dornier's performance advantage at low altitude became moot on 7 September 1940, when the Luftwaffe switched to the bombing of London (known as the Blitz), requiring all-out attacks at medium altitude. Losses mounted and on 15 September 1940, the three Dornier- equipped Kampfgruppen suffered heavily, losing 20 shot down and 13 damaged.Goss 2005, p. 60. A significant event took place on 15 September 1940, now known as \\"Battle of Britain Day\\". Among these was the famous casualty of Dornier Do 17 Z-2 Wk Nr.2361, bearing the Geschwaderkennung code of F1+FH, 1.Staffel/KG 76 flown by Robert Zehbe. Zehbe developed engine trouble and lagged half a mile behind the main bomber stream. His Dornier attracted a swarm of fighters. Eventually Ray Holmes of 504 Squadron, out of bullets, rammed the bomber. The tail came off and air pressure snapped off the outer wings short of the engines. The bomber crashed onto the forecourt of London Victoria station.Hooton 1997, p. 30.Bungay 2000, p. 325. Zehbe bailed out, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack, while the injured Holmes bailed out of his plane and survived.Those Other Eagles, Shores, (2004) This event became one of the defining moments of the Battle of Britain and elicited a congratulatory note to the RAF from Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands who had witnessed the event.\\"Alfred Keith Ogilvie Battle of Britain Pilot with 609 Squadron.\\" lycos.co.uk. Retrieved: 25 July 2009. In the same action Dornier Do 17 F1+FS of 8.Staffel/KG 76, flown by Rudolf Heitsch, was found in a field near Shoreham. The Dornier was found to be fitted with a flamethrower, installed in the tail. Oil, nitrogen, and hydrogen cylinders were found in the fuselage, while the external pipe was fitted with a jet. Initially, it was concluded that it was a smoke producing device to feign damage. But it was discovered that it was a device that was triggered by one of the rear gunners to destroy a fighter pursuing the bomber from line astern. However, the lack of oxygen meant that the device failed to function, and only a continual spray of oil was emitted.Goss 2005, p. 68. The losses for the Do 17 in August and September were considerable. In August 1940, 54 Dorniers were lost and another 20 written off due to technical problems and accidents. In September 50 more were lost, with 31 Do 17s and crews missing in action. In October another 36 Dorniers were lost.Griehl 2005, p. 11. Dorniers had improvised armament of eight machine guns installed to increase defensive firepower, but still were unable to counter fighter attacks.Griehl 2005, p. 42. The battle continued into October as the Luftwaffe concentrated on night attacks which were carried out by units mainly equipped with the Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 88, as they had bigger bomb loads, and the Ju 88 had a greater speed.Goss 2005, p. 12.

With the introduction of the Junkers Ju 88 and the new Dornier Do 217 entering production, the Do 17's days were numbered, and production ceased in mid-1940. Even with the end of production, the Dornier saw action in notable numbers after the Battle of Britain, in the Balkan Campaign, Operation Barbarossa (the invasion of the Soviet Union), and with the other Axis air forces.Goss 2005, pp. 86-87. =Balkans Campaign= Initially, Yugoslavia had been pro-German, and looked set to join the Axis Powers, but a military coup toppled the government and declared itself neutral. Infuriated, Adolf Hitler ordered the conquest of Yugoslavia. The Yugoslavs had ordered twenty Do 17 Ka-2s at the end of 1940. These machines differed from the German Dorniers in that they were powered by French Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major engines, and had non-German weapons and instruments. In 1940, the Yugoslavs license-built fifty of these variants, but most were destroyed in the campaign.Nowarra 1990, p. 16. The Luftwaffe committed Luftflotte 4 to the invasion. Included in its strength were KG 2 and KG 3, the only Kampfgruppe in a force of seven equipped with the Do 17.Goss 2005, p. 89. Among the German Kampfgruppen, some 110 Do 17s were committed. The first attacks on Belgrade were undertaken at 0651 in the morning of the 6 April. Among the German bombers were 102 Do 17s, carrying 18 SC 50 kg (110 lb) fragmentation bombs, and 2 AB 36 cluster bombs. Some 82 Do 17s remained operational after the first day, with only one reported loss, a KG 3 machine, WNr 2563 5K+DS.Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 53. The Luftwaffe and its Dorniers would find the situation similar over Greece, with little aerial opposition. took part in the Battle of Crete. I./KG 2 lost six Do 17s and seven damaged between 6 April and 31 May.de Zeng 2007 Vol 2, p. 28. III./KG 2 reported six losses and five damaged in the same period.de Zeng 2007 Vol 2, p. 33. III./KG 3 also participated in the assaults on Greece and Crete.de Zeng 2007 Vol 2, p. 42. =Eastern Front= After the successful conclusion of the Balkans campaign, the Luftwaffe prepared for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. By this time, the Kampfgruppen had mostly converted to the Ju 88, and the Do 17 played a minimal part. Only two reconnaissance Staffeln, and three Kampfgruppen employed the Dornier.Goss 2005, p. 90. KG 2 was the only sole fully equipped Luftwaffe wing that operated the Dornier. The Dornier's most notable action on the Eastern front occurred on 23–24 June at Grodno. The commander of the Soviet Western Front, General Armii Dmitriy Pavlov attempted a counterattack against Hermann Hoth's Panzergruppe 3. With air superiority and no air opposition, Dornier Do 17s of III./KG 2 destroyed columns of Soviet infantry. With help from other units, the Luftwaffe claimed to have destroyed 105 Soviet tanks. The Soviet 6th and 11th Mechanised Corps and 6th Cavalry Corps were routed. For his unit's particular effectiveness, the commander of 9./KG 2, Hauptmann Walter Bradel, received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.Bergström 2007, p. 23. A typical Luftwaffe bomber formation; Dorniers using a \\"stepped up\\" Echelon formation. The limitations of the Dornier reemerged on the Eastern Front, namely its limited bomb capacity and its range. The vastness of this new theatre meant its usage declined. As 1941 wore on, the Dornier was phased out of the bomber role. Surviving aircraft were used as test beds for new technologies and training schools, while many others were handed off to allied nations over the next two years. Total losses for Kampfgeschwader 2 on the Eastern Front in 1941 indicate three Do 17s lost in June, a further nine lost in July, nine in August, a single Dornier destroyed on the ground in September, three Do 17s in October, for a total of 24 lost in aerial combat and one on the ground. The unit was withdrawn at the end of October to convert to the Junkers Ju 88.Bergström 2007, p. 119. The Do 17 continued to see action in other air forces after the mass conversion to the Ju 88 in the Luftwaffe. Of fifteen Do 17s serving with the Finnish Air Force, at least five (possibly seven) survived the end of hostilities and continued to serve until they were scrapped in 1952.Goss 2005, p. 16. =Night fighter= The Dornier Do 17 also operated as a night fighter during the Defence of the Reich campaign until 1944. At least ten 17Z's were converted; one Z-7 and nine Z-10 served for less than two years in the night fighter role, where they were used in Josef Kammhuber's defensive system, known as the Kammhuber Line. They were found by their crews to be inferior to the Junkers Ju 88C.Smith 1967, p. 6. The Do 215 was also used in this capacity. Some German night-fighter aces such as Helmut Woltersdorf flew the Do 17 and Do 215. All surviving Z-10s were removed from front-line duty in summer 1942. They were either used as airframes to provide spare parts or transferred to night fighter schools.Munson 1983, pp. 84, 150–151. =Glider tug= After being withdrawn from combat duties the Do 17s were relegated for use as glider tugs beginning in 1942 where they were used to tow gliders laden with supplies. The First Group of Air Landing Wing (I./Luftlandegeschwader – LLG) 1 arrived too late to support the encircled German troops in the Stalingrad Pocket, but they did help to supply the 17th Army as it retreated into the Kuban in early 1943 with supplies delivered by DFS 230 gliders. Five Do 17s were lost during these operations between 29 January–30 March 1943.Schlaug 1985, pp. 129, 135, 142. During October 1943, the Do 17s of Luftlandegeschwader 1 helped resupply, and partially evacuate the German 17th Army from the Kuban. Some Do 17s were still being used by Schleppgruppen 1 and 2 (\\"Glider towing unit 1 and 2\\") in early 1945.Goss 2005, p. 15. On 10 July 1943, I./LLG 1 mustered 52 Do 17s and 136 DFS 230 gliders at its base in Lézignan-Corbières, France. On 10 November 1943, it had 36 Do 17s and 195 DFS 230s at its base at Strasbourg, but only 14 and 12 respectively were operational. On 21 July 1944, Do 17s towed two squadrons of I./LLG 1' to land troops on the Vercors Plateau where the French Resistance had declared the Vercors Republic. By 1 September I./LLG 1 had returned to its base at Strasbourg, but had only a strength of 20 Do 17s and was disbanded shortly afterwards.Schlaug 1985, pp. 174, 191, 213–215. Other air forces = Royal Yugoslav Air Force = Do 17K from the 3rd Bomber Regiment of Royal Yugoslav Air Force, April 1941 At the beginning of German invasion of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav Royal Air Force (YRAF) possessed some 60 Dornier Do 17Ks that equipped the 3 vazduhoplovni puk (3rd Bomber Regiment). It was composed of two groups: the 63rd Bomber Group stationed at Petrovec airbase near Skopje and the 64th Bomber Group stationed at Mileševo airbase near Priština. During hostilities, the aircraft factory in Kraljevo managed to produce three more aircraft. Two were delivered to the YRAF on 10 April and one on 12 April 1941. The Luftwaffe destroyed 26 of these Yugoslav Dorniers in the initial assault. Total Yugoslav losses stood at four destroyed in aerial combat and 45 destroyed on the ground.Goss 2005, p. 10. Between 14 and 15 April, seven Do 17Ks flew to Nikšić airport and took part in the evacuation of King Petar II and members of the Yugoslav government to Greece. During this operation, part of the Yugoslav gold reserves not evacuated prior to the war were also airlifted to Greece by seven Do 17s. After completing their task, five Do 17Ks were destroyed when Italian aircraft attacked Paramithia airbase in Greece. Only two Do 17Kb-1s escaped destruction and later joined the RAF in Egypt, where they were allocated the serial numbers AX707 and AX706. However, both machines were destroyed in an air attack on 27 August 1941.Goss 2005, p. 11. During this time, it is also recorded that two Dorniers escaped to the Soviet Union. According to other sources 23 Yugoslav Dorniers survived the April battles, and the RAF received a third machine.Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 47. = Bulgarian Air Force = The Bulgarian Air Force received 11 Do 17 M-1s and P-1s in 1940. After their participation in the Balkans Campaign against Yugoslavia and Greece, the Bulgarians were given 15 captured Yugoslav Do 17Kb-1s. These including spare parts, engines, and landing gear. The Dorniers were assigned to the 1./5. bombardirovicen orlijak (1st Squadron of the 5th Bomber Regiment).Nedyalkov 2001, p. 20. In the Bulgarian occupation zones of Yugoslavia, the Do 17s carried out missions against Yugoslav Chetniks and partisans in 1941–1944. They also supported Croatian forces in the same role.Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 122. Another six Do 17Ms were received in 1943.Nedyalkov 2001, p. 26. In September 1944, the Bulgarians switched sides and declared war on their former ally, Germany. At this time they had 20 Do 17s of all types assigned to the 1./5. Bomber Group and five Do 17 Ps assigned to 3./1. Reconnaissance Squadron and another four Do 17 Ps assigned to 73. Long-range Reconnaissance Flight.Nedyalkov 2001, pp. 49, 54. In 71 days of operations against German forces, 32 aircraft (including some Do 17s) in Bulgarian service were lost. In 362 combat sorties, the pilots claimed 173 lorries and motor vehicles, 42 railroad cars, seven armoured vehicles and 10 aircraft destroyed or damaged, but actual German losses were nowhere near this total. The Bulgarians had underestimated the damage done which was \\"far beyond this [these] figures\\".Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 125. With the exception of the Do 17s of 73. Long-range Reconnaissance Flight, the Do 17s didn't fly missions against the Axis after 2 December. As part of their war reparations to Yugoslavia, four Do 17s were delivered by Bulgaria after the war. Their subsequent fate remains unknown.Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 126. = Croatian Air Force = The Independent State of Croatia was formed during the German Invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. It formed an air unit called Hrvatska zrakoplovna legija (\\"Croatian Air Force Legion\\") on 27 June 1941 for service against the Soviets It had 160 airmen who attended German aviation schools such as Kampffliegerschule 3 on the Baltic to train on the Do 17Z. On 31 October 1941, the unit was assigned to Kampfgeschwader 3 as 10.(kroatisch)/KG 3,Ciglic and Savic 2007, pp. 65–66. with 15 Do 17Zs,Neulen 2000, p. 172. on the Eastern Front. The unit did not suffer its first fatalities until 1 December 1941, during the Battle of Moscow.Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 72. By the time of its withdrawal to Croatia in February/March 1942, the unit was credited with 366 combat sorties, 71 low-level attacks, four villages, 173 buildings, 276 enemy vehicles destroyed and 11 enemy aircraft shot down.Ciglic and Savic 2007, pp. 76–77. Another squadron was sent to the Eastern Front in July 1942, using German-owned Do 17Zs, where they were designated as 15.(kroat.)/KG 53. They were withdrawn to Croatia in November 1942.Neulen 2000, pp. 172–173. The number of Do 17s that saw action in Croatian units is hard to determine. Croatian staffeln formed part of German Kampfgeschwader as well as their own independent units and it is uncertain how many, if any, of their aircraft they brought back upon their return to Croatia. In January 1942, 11 Do 17Kas were given to Croatia. A further six Do 17s from Luftwaffe units were promised, but they were never delivered according to one source,Ciglic and Savic 2007, pp. 95, 98. but another says that six Do 17Es were delivered in 1942.Neulen 2000, p. 177. On 23 September 1942, or in March 1943Neulen 2000, p. 179. another 30 Do 17Es were sold to Croatia and a further 30 were promised but not delivered. In November 1943, another request was agreed for 79 Do 17Zs, but once again the aircraft were never delivered.Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 106. By December 1943, the 1st and 2nd Croat Bomber Squadrons formed part of the Croatian Air Force Legion and were to expand to a full group in size in February 1944, but it is unclear if this was more than a redesignation on paper.Neulen 2000, p. 181. On 30 July 1944, a defecting Do 17Z-5, designation Z8+AH of Kroat. KGr 1, crash-landed at Cerignola, south of Foggia, Italy.Goss 2005, p. 96. Later, in 1944, a Do 17F-1 was captured by Yugoslav partisans and flown into British captivity in Bari, Italy.,Smith 1967, p. 15. although this has not been substantiated by later research. One source cites a total of three Do 17s that landed in Allied-occupied Italy; one Do 17Z on 13 July 1944, the Do 17Z-5 mentioned earlier on 30 July 1944, and another Do 17Z on 10 August.Neulen 2000, p. 183. Further deliveries of new aircraft from Germany continued in the early months of 1945 to replace losses. These included the final dozen Do 17 medium bombers in January. The Dornier Do 17 medium bombers of the ZNDH were still hitting back when and where they could and on 31 December 1944, a Dornier Do 17E attacked an RAF 148 Squadron Handley Page Halifax bomber on the ground at the Partisan airfield at Grabovnica near Čazma, destroying it with bombs. On 10 February 1945, a single ZNDH Dornier Do 17Z caught 1. Zagorska Brigada (1st Zagorje Brigade) marching in the open near Daruvar. The Yugoslav Partisan unit suffered some two dozen casualties.Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 118. On 15 April 1945, a force made up of a Dornier Do 17Z, escorted by two Messerschmitt 109Gs destroyed two aircraft of the Yugoslav Partisans at their airfield at Sanski Most.Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 120. On the evening of 6 May 1945, with Yugoslav Partisan forces advancing upon the Croatian capital city of Zagreb, the commanding officer of the Croatian fighter group gathered together his men at Zagreb's Lucko airfield and released them from their oath of loyalty and announced that each was free to go. Some flew their aircraft and crews, including several Dornier Do 17s and a CANT Z.1007 to Italy and the Allied forces there. Some flew their aircraft over to the Partisans, including several light aircraft and some Messerschmitt 109s, whilst others, also including Messerschmitt 109s, as well as at least one Dornier Do 17Z, a Messerschmitt Bf 110G-2, a Bristol Blenheim I and a Yugoslav designed and built Zmaj Fizir F.P.2 sought sanctuary at Klagenfurt in Austria.\\"Savic and Ciglic 2002, p. 71.Likso and Canak 1998, p. 72. = Finnish Air Force = Do 17Z of the Finnish Air Force. In November 1941, Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring decided to give 15 Dornier Do 17Z aircraft to the Finnish Air Force. No. 46 Squadron operated the Dorniers. The Finns used their Do 17 aircraft mainly for night bombing and against \\"soft\\" targets at the front, since the aircraft were considered obsolete – the speed and climbing abilities of the Do 17 were deemed inadequate by 1942 standards.Kalevi and Stenman 1999, p. 13. Fifteen Do 17s (three Z-1, three Z-2 and nine Z-3) saw service with the Finns. Ten were lost between January 1943 and January 1945, the remaining five were not scrapped until in 1952. (For a full list of the Dorniers used see:Finnish Air Force No. 46 Squadron).Kalevi and Stenman 1999, pp. 50–51. = Royal Romanian Air Force = Ten Do 17Ms were received in April–May 1942 and were assigned to Escadrila 2 for reconnaissance missions.Axworthy et al. 1995, p. 290.

The band recorded and self-released their debut album Saved By Fear in 2009, which was re-released in 2010, once the band was signed to Relapse Records. History =Formation and beginning (2007–2008)= The band was formed as a sludge metal trio in 2007, by vocalist and guitarist Zafrir Tzori, drummer Yariv Shilo and bassist Cavan, all coming from very different musical backgrounds, playing in bands that varied from chillout/ambient, country and blues to post-punk and heavy metal. Dukatalon started writing original material and performing around Israel right away, releasing a self-titled demo EP in 2007, and performing mostly within the hardcore punk and grindcore scene of Tel Aviv. On June 14, 2008, the band performed alongside UK mathcore/grindcore band Trencher, in the Maximum Pain Festival, that took place at the rather small, but widely acknowledged Patiphone club in Tel Aviv, and featured many of Israel's finest punk, hardcore, grindcore and mathcore bands.http://userserve- ak.last.fm/serve/_/6129173/Maximum+Pain+Festival+maximum.jpg Following the show, the band flew to the US to record their debut album at Roco Studios in Indianapolis, IN.http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=8445145 =Saved By Fear (2008–present)= In May 2009, the band went on their first tour to Europe, after which they released their debut album Saved By Fear, which was self-released and distributed worldwide through the American label Sleeping Village Records, but printed in a very small volume. After the album is released, Cavan leaves the band and was replaced by Eliya Gwetta, who was later replaced by Lior Mayer. In 2010, the band was signed by Relapse Records, and though the band remained inactive for most of the year, their album Saved By Fear was re-released on November 16, 2010, by Relapse Records, and on December 14, 2010 it appeared on iTunes.https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/saved-by-fear/id399303444 In 2011, Dukatalon performed all over Israel, playing mostly small venues alongside bands such as Prey for Nothing (melodic death metal), Chains of Past Decisions (post-hardcore), Shreadhead (Groove Metal), Dirk Diggler (grindcore) and more. On November 24, 2011, the band opened for stoner rock trio Karma to Burn at the Levotin 7 club in Tel Aviv, Israel, and accompanied the American group on their Israeli Tour.http://www.last.fm/event/3100325+Karma+To+Burn+at+Levontin+7+on+24+November+2011 On September 5, 2011, it was announced that the band will be entering the studio to record another cover of the song \\"Mainline\\", originally by sludge metal veterans Buzzov*en, for a project entitled \\"Hell Comes Home\\".http://www.facebook.com/Dukatalon/posts/120520884716510 An earlier made cover recording of this song was originally included on a tribute compilation back in 2007. On September 27, 2011, bassist Lior Mayer decides to leave the band to pursue musical education abroad, and the band's final show with this line up took place on October 12, 2011, at the Levontin 7 club.http://www.facebook.com/Dukatalon/posts/240644209319438 In January 2012, a new bassist is introduced by the band - Roy Ben Samuel. Roy's first show with the band takes place on January 20, 2012, at the legendary underground spot \\"Zimmer\\" in Tel Aviv.http://www.last.fm/event/3287609+Dukatalon+at+Zimmer+on+20+January+2012 2013 saw Dukatalon writing new material and giving live performances in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa. In 2014 the band starts working on a new album. A very high standard is set for the recordings and progress is slow. Meticulous work is divided between three studios - the classical music orientated, state owned \\"Jerusalem Music Center\\" and the small, progressive and hardcore Tel Aviv based \\"Heavy Studios\\" and \\"Bardo\\". The work continues throughout 2015. Occasional live shows are also played in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Kiryat Malakhi. 2016 sees Dukatalon in the final stages of the album recordings, and on tour in Europe once again, this time in the UK.

An untouched, vast open space in the middle of Tokyo hosts diverse species of wildlife which have been catalogued in field research. For comparison, this article also covers biodiversity in other open spaces in the central districts of Tokyo. The location of the Tokyo Imperial Palace and its environs Tokyo Imperial Palace Panorama The Tokyo Imperial Palace is situated in the center of Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo. It is in size and encircled by moats. The Palace is divided into the eastern part and the western part by the Kan-Moat and Hasuike Moat. The eastern part is called the Imperial Palace Eastern Garden and has been open to the public since 1968.Biology Study Group[2001:246] In the western part are: the Fukiage Gyoen (Garden), including the Imperial residence, the Palace, and the Imperial Household Agency. An attempt to maintain or recreate its natural state is evident in the Fukiage Garden. The Palace lies on the tip of Musashino Terrace, between the Arakawa River, plus Iruma River and Tama River. There are moats at the northern and western end of the Palace. The height of the Palace is from , with the lowest point being at the Shimo-Dokan Moat.Biology Study Group[2001:246] The eastern end faces the low areas of Tokyo. The Palace is encircled by moats, any of which have been created artificially, since stones had been carried from other places. According to the Meteorological agency neighboring the Palace, the mean temperature is . The difference in mean temperature of summer and winter is about . The precipitation is of considerable degree in summer and autumn, while it is minimum in winter.Biology Research Institute[1989:4] Fushimi Yagura with Japanese black pine trees Hasuikebori lotus moat History of the Palace =Before the Edo Era= A midden was excavated from 1955 to 1964. Jōmon pottery was found, indicating that the Palace was inhabited in the Jōmon period, before 300 BCE.Biology Research Institute[1989:4] Toward the end of the Heian period, Edo Shirō () built his residence in Edo, but its exact location remains unknown. Ōta Dōkan constructed the Edo Castle from 1456 to 1457. Hōjō Ujitsuna occupied the Edo Castle in 1524. Later the Castle was controlled by Hojo's retainers, the Toyama clan. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu lived here when Edo became his stronghold. The Palace, at that time, faced the sea of Hibiya on the eastern end. The Nishinomaru area had been the site for temples and recreation. There were 16 temples corresponding to the site of Fukiage garden.Biology Research Institute[1989:4–9] In 1603, he became the shōgun and started to enlarge the Edo castle along with many of his successors. =Palace in the Edo Era= Many castles and moats were constructed; stones were transferred from Izu Peninsula; A large quantity of lime (material) from Ōme, Tokyo, and the whole Edo castle was completed with the completion of the Outer Moat in 1638.Biology Research Institute[1989:6–9] The Edo castles were greatly damaged in 1657 by the Great Fire of Meireki. (See Fires in Edo) The reconstruction of Tenshu or castle tower was abandoned because of the stability or peace of the times. Fire barrier zones were set up to prevent fires from spreading. That started with moving the primary residences of the Gosanke, who were three major relatives of Tokugawa shogunate; outside of the Edo Castle and dedicating the vacated space to fire prevention. Relocation of residences belonging to other daimyōs and hatamoto, who were direct retainers of the shōgun, followed. From the end of the 17th century to the beginning of the 18th century, the Fukiage Gyoen remained a large garden.Biology Research Institute[1989:6-9]Biology Study Group[2001:248] When Tokugawa Ienobu was in office, (1709–1712) he ordered the daimyōs to help construct a large garden with a large pond (1 hectare which has remained), a fall and a river. During the rule of Tokugawa Yoshimune (1716–1745), the Fukiage gardens changed considerably in accord with his philosophy of the promotion of diligence, industrial development and the encouragement of literary and martial arts. He built a study hall, atelier, astronomical observatory, equestrian grounds, archery field, gun field, herb refinery, food factories for sake, sugar, cake and a sheep-raising yard. However, Tokugawa Ienari (office 1787–1837) made the Fukiage Gyoen to the previous gardens. In the later years of the Edo era, not much attention was given to the garden. Nishinomaru and Fukiage, residences of the three Tokugawa families, 17th century =Palace after the Meiji Restoration= After the Meiji Restoration, the Gardens were subject to somewhat random change for a century. The Nishinomaru Palace burned down in 1873. A new Meiji Palace was constructed in 1888. Starting in 1928, the government constructed a short golf course, first of 4 courses and in 1931, of 9 holes (par was 30; almost entire garden was used) for the Emperor Hirohito in the Garden.Tashiro[2010:148-151, 215-216] In 1937, Hirohito discontinued golf and the maintenance of lawn was discontinued. Around 1939 and 1941, the maintenance of the garden was also discontinued. A wartime bombproof residence-shelterO-bunko, Biology Research Institute[1989:39] was constructed in 1941. While the formal Meiji Palace burned down, the imperial residence was undamaged. The Fukiage residence was completed in 1961 and the formal Palace was completed in 1968. Starting in 1948, some plants were transplanted in accord with the wish of Hirohito who wanted the Garden to become an old-Tokyo type forest. Basically, the maintenance of the Garden was to be kept at a minimum. Surveys of the Biota of the Palace Imperial Palace Tokyo Map, Investigation only in the dark green area In 1921, the plants in the Palace were inventoried and published in Imperial Palace Landscape.In Japanese language only: Kyujo Fuchi Ko by Yukio Ichikawa This was the first survey of the plants of the Palace. Surveys continued in 1979 (Fukiage Garden), 1980 (Imperial Palace West Block), 1981 (East Gardens), and in 1987-88 (aquatic organisms in moats and ponds). These reports are not available to the public, but provide precise information about the vegetation, its time-course changes, old historic and giant trees. Further surveys started in 1996. The survey of living organisms was reported in 2006.Biology Study Group[20018-9] Flora Fukiage Gyoen(Garden), dark area, photographed in 1979 When Tokugawa Ieyasu entered the Edo castle in 1590, there was a beautiful coastline fringed with Japanese black pine trees. The present-day Palace faced the sea at that time. In the early years of the Edo period, there were residences of influential daimyōs. After the latter half of the 17th century, the central parts of the Palace were made beautiful gardens. In the early years of Showa, a golf course of 9 holes was made, which was abolished by the wish of Hirohito in 1937. Hirohito also hoped that the gardens would be left so that nature would be returned; some of the trees were transplanted since 1948. The biota of the Palace reflects the long history of the Palace. The present Fukiage Garden is mainly composed of woods, although there are small houses, fruit gardens, a rose garden, farms, one for mulberry trees (silkworms). Investigations between 1996 and 1999 revealed woods with broad-leaved evergreen forest trees such as Ilex integra, Castanopsis sieboldii, and Machilus thunbergii on the periphery of the Fukiage Garden, namely over the Dokan Moat, and woods with deciduous broad-leaved trees such as Quercus acutissima in the central part of the Garden. These woods are well cared and minimum cutting is done by the Garden section of the Imperial Household Agency. Although the woods are not the Old-growth forest, the constituents of ever green trees are like those seen in nature. On the contrary, deciduous broad-leaved trees have been planted artificially. The soil is revealed to be good for the development of trees. Well-grown trees and elements of Satoyama such as fruit gardens provide good circumstances for small animals such as insects. Well developed woods of the Palace cool the temperature of Tokyo; the temperature is lower by 2 °C in summer, and are good for the central parts of Tokyo which is influenced by the urban heat island phenomenon.Biology Study Group[2001:211,243] =Giant trees and historic trees= In the Fukiage Garden there is a line of Zelkova serrata trees. A tree with a circumference of was revealed to be of genroku era origin (from 1688 to 1703) by the growth ring method in the 1970s. The time might have been earlier since there was a larger tree of . In the Yamabukino Nagare of the Fukiage Gardern, Tokugawa Ienari (office 1787 - 1837) ordered the transplantation of famous 40 black pine trees, which were 17 in the Taisho era and 5 in 1986, including those which were re-transplanted.Biology Research Institute[1989:12-19] In days gone by, several hundred fir trees were seen, but decreased in number and in 2001, there are only 8 trees inside the Garden. In Tokyo Prefecture, Tashiroran (Epipogium roseum), a kind of Orchidaceae without chlorophyll was discovered in the Palace.Biology Study Group[2001:244-245] Between the publication of 1986 and the surveys of 1996-1999, 55 species had disappeared, possibly because of the deepening of the woods and insufficient sunlight. Zelkova serrata, Keyaki (Japanese) =Bryophytes and lichens= There are 77 species of mosses, 29 species of liverworts (hepatics) and one species of hornwort in the Palace. The Palace is the most rich place, followed by Institute for Nature Study with 52 species. Endangered species such as Taxiphyllum alternans (Card.) Z. Iwats and Monosolenium tenerum were found in the Palace, while common species associated with urbanization such as Funaria hygrometrica and Marchantia polymorpha were not found in the Palace. 57 species of lichens were found in the Palace. Of them 3 genera and 5 species were first found in the Palace. Parmotrema tinctorum and Usnea rubescens Stirt which are weak in atmospheric pollution were not found in the Palace. =Algae= Interesting algae has been found, including 11 species of cyanobacteria, 156 species of diatoms (including varieties), 58 species of green algae and other species of algae. =Fungi= There have been 368 species of fungi found, including 8 new species. Previously Hirohito had inventoried and left in place 64 species of Mycetozoa. New investigations between 1996 and 1999 revealed 88 species of Mycetozoa. 19 species previously recorded were not found in the new investigations. Naturalist Minakata Kumagusu gave a short seminar to the emperor. He took Hirohito for a walk in the woods on the island, then gave him a 25-minute lecture, on board the royal ship Nagato, on slime molds on June 1, 1929. Minakata presented the Emperor with gifts including 110 specimens of slime molds kept in empty taffy boxes. =Detailed explanations of the vegetation of the Palace= Detailed explanations of the vegetation of the Palace with species are made in the reference in English.Biology Research Institute[1989:41–58] They include 1. Trees, Giant Trees and Historic Trees, Bonsai in the Imperial Palace, 2. Herbaceous Plants and Shrubs, Fukiage Gardens, Plants around the Moats, Other locations, Naturalized Plants in Japan 3. Four seasons at the Imperial Palace. =Three noted trees= There are three noted species of trees of the Palace. One is a fir tree (Abies) in the Three Palace Sanctuaries. In the Meiji era, other trees of the same species were more than several hundreds in number, but only 8 trees survived in 2001. This one grew to a large size.Biology Study Group[2001:228] Three Palace Sanctuaries in the Taishō era in the 1920s. The second is Liquidambar formosana Hance (English name: sweet gum) (Japanese name: fū), which was transplanted from China in 1727 by Tokugawa Yoshimune. Originally L. formosana was planted where Chinese emperors lived. There were 13 tall trees in the Fukiage Garden; the tallest was about high, and in circumference, but whether they were introduced in 1727 was not verified. The crowns of this tree turn reddish-orange or crimson red in fall.Biology Research Institute[1989:46-47]Biology Study Group[2001:228-229] Liquidambar formosana The third is Metasequoia glyptostroboides, the dawn redwood. A young plant and 500 seeds were presented to Japan by an American scholar in 1949. The young plant and one from a seed were planted in the south of Kaentei House of the Fukiage Garden. Both were high and one was and the other in breast-height circumference in 2001.Biology Study Group[2001:229] Metasequoia glyptostroboides =Monitoring vegetation with satellites= The vegetation of the Palace was monitored with Ikonos satellite (March 10, 2000) and LandStat satellite (July 25, 1999). Evergreen, broad-leafed species such as Cinnamomum camphora, Machilus thunbergii, and Lithocarpus edulis were differentiated from temperate deciduous trees, such as cherry blossoms, Quercus acutissima, Zelkova serrata and Acer palmatum. Temperature changes were monitored with the LandStat satellite. It was suggested that the Palace interfered with the urban heat island phenomenon.Biology Study Group[2001:206-213] =Hirohito and nature= Naoru Tanaka, a chamberlain of Japan for Hirohito remembered an episode which took place in September 1965, on the day Hirohito returned from a 2-month stay from his summer resort. On the previous day, Tanaka had ordered the cleaning of the very thick weed and bush of garden of Hirohito. Hirohito scolded him asking why he ordered the cleaning. He replied that the weed was so thick. Hirohito said that there was no such word as weed. Every plant had its name. Since then, every question of Hirohito concerning plants came to him, although his speciality was geography. Hirohito loved nature, but thought of birds coming to the Palace and he ordered plants for wild birds be planted, such as Pyracantha, Idesia, Ardisia japonica, Ilex rotunda, Ilex serrata and Viburnum plicatum var. tomentosum. According to Tanaka, Hirohito's idea of leaving old-Tokyo woods in the Palace was based on his experience of the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake; it should be a place for evacuation.Anezaki[2005:39-43] Fauna =Mammals= Small Japanese mole (Mogera imaizumii) is considered to have lived from the Edo era, while the origin of raccoon dog and masked palm civet which were found in the Palace remains unknown. But the latter two animals are found inside Tokyo Prefecture such as Imperial Akasaka residences and in Machida city,Biology Study Group[2001:331] and probably they are not of pet origin. Japanese house bat and small Japanese moles are considered of natural origin in the Palace.Biology Study Group[2001:68-51] The number of Japanese house bat is small, because the woods are so dark at night that insects are enough for their food. DNA studies revealed that small Japanese moles in the Palace and those of neighboring Tokyo area of Hino city are the same in species, although they have become extinct inside central Tokyo except the Palace. The small Japanese mole has inhabited the Palace grounds since the early years of the Edo era Masked palm civet on tree Wild raccoon dogs at Fukuyama, Hiroshima =Amphibians and reptiles= In the Palace, bullfrogs have greatly increased in number, with adverse effects on reptiles, amphibians and insects. The affected reptiles include the Chinese pond turtle, Trachemys scripta elegans, Chinese softshell turtle, Takydromus tachydromoides, Japanese rat snake, Japanese striped snake, Hebius vibakari, and various geckos and lizards. The distribution of amphibians is very interesting. Salamander was not found in the Palace. Bufo japonicus formosus Japanese tree frog, bullfrog were found but, Japanese brown frog, Daruma pond frog, Japanese wrinkled frog could not be found.Biology Study Group[2001:108-109] The smaller number of frogs and the disappearance of the three frogs were considered to be due to the extraordinary increase of bullfrogs. Once a species disappears such as by bullfrogs, it is extremely difficult to return to the previous condition because of the closed nature of the Palace. bullfrog has had harmful effects on other animals in the Palace =Birds= The northern goshawk, a raptor, which used to winter on Palace grounds, gradually stayed for all seasons.Biology Study Group[2001:28-33] Nosuri (Buteo japonicus) also stayed in the Palace. As a result, ducks and Oriental turtle doves decreased. The goshawk preyed mainly on jungle crows.Biology Study Group[2001:31-41] In the 1950s, heron was hunted away because they damaged the trees in the Palace. Around 1975, the common kingfisher, the Japanese pygmy woodpecker, the Hakusekirei (Motacilla alba lugens) which is a kind of white wagtail, and the brown-eared bulbul have become sedentary birds on the Palace grounds.Biology Study Group[2001:26] It is not unusual for birds to become urbanized, especially the common kingfisher. The route of common kingfisher to the Palace is being investigated, and was thought to be through green open spaces in neighboring Tokyo areas. In the 1950s, the colonies of herons and great cormorant disappeared in the Palace, as a result of deteriorating living conditions. The northern goshawk, a raptor, took up residence on the palace grounds, preying on the avian community Common kingfisher Wild birds observed by a photographer The following list shows wild birds observed by Takuya KanouchiAnezaki[2005:118-122] between April 1994 and March 1995 in the Palace gardens including the eastern garden. He is a freelance wild bird photographer. Little grebe, great cormorant, black-crowned night heron, little egret, grey heron, Mandarin duck, mallard, Eastern spot-billed duck, Eurasian wigeon, northern pintail, tufted duck, black kite, northern goshawk, Eurasian sparrowhawk, nosuri (Japanese) Buteo japonicus, common moorhen, black-headed gull, European herring gull, Oriental turtle dove, lesser cuckoo, brown hawk- owl, common kingfisher, Japanese green woodpecker, Japanese pygmy woodpecker, barn swallow, common house martin, grey wagtail, Motacilla alba lugens, brown- eared bulbul, bull-headed shrike, Daurian redstart, pale thrush, Naumann's thrush, Japanese bush warbler, goldcrest, coal tit, varied tit, Japanese tit, warbling white-eye, meadow bunting, black-faced bunting, hawfinch, Eurasian tree sparrow, white-cheeked starling, azure-winged magpie, carrion crow and jungle crow. =Fish= Ten species of fish commonly seen in Japan were found in the Dōkan Moat including common carp, Carassius cuvieri, Carassius auratus langsdorfii, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus and stone moroko.Literal translation of Biology Study Group [2001:102-107] In the Hasuike Moat, northern snakehead was confirmed in addition. DNA studies of the obtained Carassius auratus langsdorfii revealed that all fish were triploidy females or tetraploidy females. They reproduce in a clone-like fashion, by ameiotic parthenogenesis. The same phenomenon was also seen in the same species of fish in the moat of Hiroshima castle, Hiroshima Prefecture. The researcher analyzed it by the cytoflow method.Biology Study Group[2001:102-107] Carassius auratus langsdorfii, ginbuna (Japanese) =Crustaceans= In the moats, Palaemon adspersus, Macrobrachium, nukaebi (Paratya improvisa) and Procambarus clarkii were found, in many numbers except Macrobrachium. Procambarus clarkii was not obtained in the Dokan Moat.Biology Study Group[2001:110-111] In the eastern Garden, a crab, sawagani or (Geothelphusa dehaani) was confirmed. In the moats, parasitic crustaceans were found in stone moroko, Carassius auratus langsdorfii, Carassius cuvieri and in some shrimps. As land living crustaceans, 16 species of Isopoda and two species of Gammaridea were found. The most common Isopoda was Tokyo koshibiro dangomushi which is usually found in deep woods. Three species of Harpacticoida were found from the soil, indicating a stable circumstance of the Palace like woods in the mountains. Palaemon adspersus in great numbers in the moat of the Palace =Myriapodae= In the Fukiage Garden, 41 species of Myriapodae were found; of them, seven had not been previously documented. In Chiba Prefecture, 73 species were found, and in the Palace, about half of those found in Chiba Prefecture have been found, indicating the richness of nature in the Palace. Characteristic in the Myriapodae in the Palace was that the species were those found in the subtropical zone. This may suggest that before the construction of Edo castle, the Palace was in the laurel forest zone. =Pseudoscorpions= Four species of pseudoscorpion were found in the Palace, indicating the smallness of pseudoscopion in the Palace, compared with the northern Kanto Prefectures. During the long history of the Palace, there might have been periods when the Palace was not good for the ecology of pseudoscorpions. =Spiders= Thirty families of spiders which included 141 species of spiders were inventoried between 1996 and 1999, smaller than counted elsewhere in the Prefecture. This may be explained by the change of circumstances not conducive for spiders. Many species of spiders were common in the Palace as well as outside the palace gardens; suggesting that spiders might spread by the wind. =Oribatidae, Tardigrades, Earthworms= Thirty-nine families and 68 species of Oribatida were confirmed in the Palace, indicating a natural circumstance in comparison with the investigations in Meiji Shrine, Todoroki Valley, Residence of Prince Hitachi, Musashi-Murayama city and Kokubunji city.Biology Study Group[2001:66-67] Four families, nine genera and 21 species of Tardigrade were found in the Palace.Biology Study Group[2001:52-59] Three families, four genera and 20 species of earthworms were found in the Palace. Of them, four had not been documented. Compared with the investigations in 11 spots in Tokyo, the Palace had the most good soil for the earthworms.Biology Study Group[2001:58-61] Thirteen species of fresh water shellfishes and 40 species of land snail were confirmed in the Palace. Freshwater shellfishes previously commonly seen in Japan became rare, but they were seen in the Palace, including Sphaerium japonicum, a kind Viviparidae and Radix auricularia. As an example of artificial intervention, kawanina, or Semisulcospira libertina, was introduced for the growth of fireflies. Land living shellfishes are divided into the native group which favored deranged environments living the subtropical zone and a group introduced by foreign countries. Some species might have lived in the Edo era, while some others might have been introduced from foreign countries.Biology Study Group[2001:196-201] Animal plankton was studies in the Dokan Moat, Hasuike Moat and Hyo Pond, an artificial pond from 1996 to 1999. =Insects= Odonatae In the investigation of 1987 and 1988, eight families and 27 species of Odonatae were found, and the following monitoring six species were found, in all eight families and 33 species.Biology Study Group[2001:86-93] In one ku of Tokyo mainland Prefecture, 20-30 species of Odonata were usually found. Some of those which disappeared in central Tokyo were found, such as biniitotonbo (Ceriagrion nipponicum), kosanae and aoyanma (Aeschnophlebia longistigma). Chotonbo (Rhyothemis fuliginosa) has become a resident, while Rubia has considerably decreased. The Palace revealed to be a precious place for Odonata, although water areas are not so large. Grasshoppers Forty-five species of grasshoppers were found in the Palace, indicating the richness of nature in the Palace, compared with other central parts of Tokyo. Aphids Two families, 95 species of aphids were found in the palace. In the monitoring of aphids between 2001 and 2005, 20 more species were confirmed; totaling 115 species. The Palace was shown to be like Satoyama in the environment, which is good for aphids. Scale insects Nine families and 127 species, including those not documented before, were found in the Palace. Some of the species indicate the effects of urban heat island phenomenon. Pentatomoidea Forty-one families and 214 species of pentatomoidea were confirmed. Some of them might have been introduced with the plants transplanted into the Palace, since earlier investigations in the ku areas of Tokyo Prefecture revealed less than 200 species. On the contrary, water-born Hemiptera do not have an ability to move so much and may reflect the previous condition. They are seldom senn in central Tokyo except the Palace. Kooimushi or Diplonychu japonicus belonging to Pentatomoidea in the Palace, which is not seen in other parts of Tokyo Thrips Three families and 74 species were found in the Palace, including 10 plus several species not documented in Japan before.Biology Study Group[2001:146-151] Moths Forty-two families and 514 species of moths were confirmed in the investigations of 1996 to 1999.Biology Study Group[2001:134-137] One of the moths had become extinct, but it was seen again and it was because the lichen it eats was weak in atmospheric pollutions such as photochemical smog in the 1970s. Oomizuao Actias artemis rare in central Tokyo, was seen in the Palace Butterflies Eight families and 37 species of butterflies were confirmed in the investigations of 1996 to 1999. In the monitoring of 2001 to 2005, 11 more species were found, to a total of 48 species, indicating that the Palace is a precious area for the butterflies.Biology Study Group[2001:176-183] Butterflies fly from one place to another, so that, various open green spaces in Tokyo are important in the ecology of butterflies. Administrative works should be to a minimum, since butterflies are small in number in the Meiji Shrine which is well cared and administered. Jakou-ageha Atrophaneura alcinous rare in central Tokyo, was seen in the Palace Beetles According to the survey between 1996 and 1998, three families and 738 species of Beetles were confirmed in the Palace including Prosopocoilus inclinatus, which is rarely seen in central Tokyo.Biology Study Group[2001:168-175] Oomidzusumashi or a kind of whirligig beetle which has become extinct in central Tokyo was also confirmed. Beetles in the Palace suggests close relationships with those in the Izu Peninsula and Miura Peninsula. The presence of chairochibigengoro, or a kind of Dytiscidae, which is seen near the sea, may suggest that the Palace was once near the seashore.Biology Study Group[2001:173-175] 2 families and 39 species of longhorn beetle were confirmed in the Palace. Five families and 161 species of rove beetles were confirmed between 1996 and 1997 and the following monitoring. Nokogiri kuwagara, rare in central Tokyo, was seen in the Palace Wasps Forty-eight families and 513 species of bees were confirmed in the investigations of 1996 to 1999. Ants Forty-nine species of ants were confirmed in the Palace; which is a larger number than that in Ota-ku, Nakano-ku, and Itabashi-ku, Tokyo. Ants in the Palace were characterized by their not being the species spreading their spheres artificially. Vespinae 18 families and 128 species of vespinae were confirmed, including Vespinae and honeybees. Most honeybees are Apis cerana japonica Rad, which is common in Japan. The reason why western honey bees are smaller in number might be that Apis cerane japonica has resistance to larger Vespinae. Flies and mosquitoes 525 species of flies and mosquitoes, including kogata-akaieka (Culex tritaeniorhynchus) which transmits Japanese encephalitis, were confirmed in 1996 and 1997. There were 74 species of Chironomidae, this number corresponded to the whole number seen in the area of Tama River. The species of flies were the same as those of Tama Area of Tokyo and those multiply in the garbage were few in number. Among the flies, there were 77 species of Drosophilidae in the Palace. The ecology studies with Drosophilidae in the Palace and the experimental plantation in Chiba revealed that both places have woods, and grassland and marshland in common, serving to the diversity of animals. Although the Palace is a secluded circumstance, its connections with outer circumstances are apparent and important. Proturae Three families and 16 species of proturae were confirmed, indicating the richness of nature of the Palace. Springtails Twelve families and 74 species of springtail were confirmed in the Palace indicating the favorable circumstances of the Palace. Characteristics of the Biota of Tokyo Imperial Palace Based on the distribution of Myriapoda and spiders, the Tokyo Imperial Palace area had been a laurel forest facing the sea, before the entry of Tokugawa Ieyasu into the Edo castle. Since then, it had been changed in a number of ways such as the castle, residences of daimyōs, gardens and a golf course. In 1937, the administration as a park had been discontinued and in 1948, at the request of Hirohito that nature of old Musashino or old Tokyo should be revived, some of the plants of Musashino or old Tokyo were transplanted. Although it is not a virgin forest, the Tokyo Imperial Palace is exceptionally rich in nature, considering its location in the heart of a great city. Therefore, the biota of the Palace is rich in vegetation as well as in animals of the Animal Kingdom. While small Japanese mole has outlived a long history since the Edo era, this is an exceptional case, and it is considered that many living creatures and plants have disappeared. Especially due to urbanization and pollution, such as photochemical smog in the 1970s, big trees such as fir and Cryptomeria have withered. Large sized lichens have completely disappeared. As a constituent of the biota of the Palace, the bringing of animals or plants from outside, either intentionally or unintentionally, is important. In the present investigations, many new species have been observed. Although the Palace is a closed circumstance, the effects from other places should be watched for any changes. As constituents of animals and vegetation, Cryptoparlatorea edentata (Takagi et Kawai, 1966) might have been introduced in the Edo era with transplanted fir, indicating the effects of trees at large. Some of land shellfishes might also have been introduced. Some species which had not been documented were found in algae, Oribatida and earthworms. The Palace is encircled by Central Tokyo, and bordered by moats. Some of the living creatures without an ability to move may disappear, while the introduction of bullfrogs produced immense effects on other animals. There is closedness of the Palace but at the same time, there are also strong connections with the outer world. The northern goshawk has become a sedentary bird, producing great changes in the ecology of other birds. The biota has shown constant changes, and it should be maintained, with the least artificial modulations of the circumstances.Biology Study Group[2001:21, 253] References *Biological Research Institute (Biological Laboratory Imperial Household), Flora Sedis Imperatoris Japonicae1989, Hoikusha, *Biology Study Group(National Science Museum Imperial Palace Biota Investigation Group) Biota of Imperial Palace Fukiage Garden 2001, Sekai Bunkasha, *Kazuma Anezaki, Mitsuhiko Imamori, Takuya Kanouchi, Woods in the Palace, 2005, Shinchōsha, In this book, observations in the eastern garden were included. *Yasuhisa Tashiro, Hirohito and golf, A key to the understanding of the Showa era, 2012, Shufunotomo-sha, Footnotes Category:Tokyo Imperial Palace Category:Gardens in Tokyo Category:Palaces in Tokyo Category:Biota of Japan Category:Natural history of Japan Category:Japanese woods ","title":"Biota of Tokyo Imperial Palace"},{"id":"35816879","title":"Snowpiercer"},{"id":"35816913","text":"thumb Helena Grossówna (1904, Thorn, German Empire – 1994, Warsaw, Poland) was a Polish actress and dancer, who starred in several popular Polish films during the interwar period.

They include the Paulanerhof (1894) and the Habig-Hof (1896).\\"Carl Holzmann\\", Architektenlexikon Wien 1770–1945. Retrieved 15 May 2012. Biography Carl Holzmann was first trained as a bricklayer. After a period in Germany and Upper Austria, he settled in Vienna, where he worked for a builder in Liesing and attended Mathias Prem's building school. From 1873 to 1875, he was foreman for City Architect Sonnleithner and the building contractor Johann Sturany. From 1875 to 1877, he studied at the Vienna University of Technology. He then worked for the Union-Baugesellschaft (Union Construction Company), where he contributed to the Palace of Justice as deputy foreman and to the Hofburg Palace as a draftsman. In 1885, Holzmann started his own construction company, which was initially successful but, probably as a result of inadequate quotations, fell into bankruptcy in 1906. As a result, he had to sell all his properties. Thereafter Holzmann worked on national or provincial assignments for the remainder of his life. His firm was still in debt when he died at the age of 65 but was maintained by his wife and daughter until 1928. Approach Carl Holzmann designed his buildings strictly in accordance with Historicist principles although his later works were decorated in the Vienna Secession style. His buildings in the centre of Vienna exhibit a representative style while those in the outskirts were influenced by the Swiss chalet style. Holzmann often bought old properties, replacing them with buildings to his own designs. He included components of all the fashionable styles of his day, integrated by his own experienced hand. Hardly a proponent of innovation, he simply kept up with mainstream architectural trends.

That accident was caused by a prank by the local football star, Vin, who is sent to a juvenile detention center as punishment. Their family has emigrated from Lebanon and is distantly related to Kahlil Gibran. The brothers are forced to not only take care of themselves but care for their aging uncle, Bill. Joseph, who has mysterious pains, goes to work for Gloria, a book-packager, to get health insurance. Gloria tries to convince Joseph to write a book about his family, thinking this will return her to success in the publishing world. Joseph, who is gay, starts a romance with a reporter.

He is a sports announcer for NBC Sports coverage of the NHL as well as Notre Dame Fighting Irish football and NBC Sunday Night Football. He is also perhaps the face of NBC Sports Network, anchoring much of its staple programming, including the NHL, Tour De France, college football, college basketball and the Premier League. Early life and education McHugh grew up in Williston Park on Long Island and played basketball and soccer at Herricks High School. His father, Frank McHugh, was a long-time track coach at a different high school on Long Island called Elmont. McHugh graduated from the University at Buffalo and received his master's degree from Syracuse University. Career Prior to joining NBC, he worked at Newsday (1999-2001), WTHI in Terre Haute, Indiana (2004-2007), KOKH in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (2007-2009), and ESPN The Magazine (2001-2007). On April 5, 2010, The Daily Line debuted with McHugh as host. The show consisted of a four-person panel (host McHugh, handicapper Rob DeAngelis, comedian Reese Waters, and former Playboy model Jenn Sterger) which discussed, often with heavy satire, sports-related topics that were popular that day and aired on Versus. However, the show was canceled due to low viewership on November 4, 2010. McHugh would be retained by the network to originally work on NHL coverage, mostly on NHL Overtime and Hockey Central. In 2011, McHugh began the year as the host of NHL Live, the network's pre- and post-game show that airs before and after each NHL telecast. He also contributed to NBC's Stanley Cup coverage, hosting Games 1 and 2. In the summer of 2011, McHugh stepped into the role of host for NBC's live daily coverage of the Tour de France. In the fall, he contributed to the NBC Sports Network's college football coverage as the host of the newly created College Football Talk, a weekly wrap up show. Additionally, he served each week as the host for the network's studio show before and after game coverage. 2012 saw McHugh return to the NBC and NBC Sports Network coverage of the NHL as lead studio host. He hosted NHL Live several times weekly and the NHL on NBC intermission report weekly. He finished off the 2011-2012 NHL season in his biggest role to date, hosting every game of the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals. He served as a reporter for NBC's Super Bowl XLVI pre-game coverage. McHugh expanded his portfolio even farther as he was to be a part of NBC Sports's coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics. McHugh hosted the afternoon action on NBC Sports Network daily throughout the games. In the fall, he continued to host NBC's college football studio show alongside Doug Flutie and newcomer Hines Ward. In November 2012, McHugh hosted NBC Sports Network’s Carrier Classic Countdown, live from the deck of the USS Bataan, as well as pre-game, halftime and post-game coverage. He made his Winter Olympics debut as a hockey host at the 2014 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi for NBC. For the final 6 weeks of the 2015-2016 Premier League season, McHugh filled in as the Lead Studio Host for the Monday afternoon Premier League games while Rebecca Lowe was on maternity leave. McHugh continued in that capacity for the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 Premier League seasons when he has no NHL responsibilities for NBC Sports Network. Shortly before Super Bowl LII, it was announced that McHugh would join Dan Patrick as a studio co-host for the game, filling in for Mike Tirico as the latter prepared to anchor the 2018 Winter Olympics, set to open a few days later.

Originally deriving from biology, where the term hybridizations denotes the process of combining different varieties of organism to create a hybrid, the term is transferred to the field of political communication when a hybrid election campaign arises. One main aspect of this concept is the emphasis on an international comparative perspective. In Globalization theory the term hybridization means the ongoing blending of cultures, which denotes in political campaign communication also the blending of political cultures. Characteristics Hybridization in political campaigning is concerned with the diffusion of political communication practices “mediated by cultural factors and accentuated by specific institutional arrangements” and “where country-specific, traditional modes are supplemented with select features of transnationally traded modern practices\\" Influence factors An important role in the development of campaign practices plays the political culture in the specific country. This culture finds expression in the relationship between political culture and political communication as organizing framework for comparing political systems The three key dimensions are the relationship between the media and the political system (e.g. regulations for political ads on TV), the norms that define roles and function of media for society (e.g. publishing of delicate private details of candidates) and relationship between citizens and political system (e.g. political fatigue) In the process of hybridization “new technologies and techniques are adapted and blended together with preexisting modes of campaigning” Although the rise of the Internet, for example, lead to a variety of political websites of candidates, the preexisting norm of how personal a candidate is shown in campaign, i.e. whether there are information about the personal life of the candidate or not, remains decisive for the shape of the website. Contextual constraints There are several influence factors which determinate the way of hybridization, which practice is applied and which not. For example there are no candidate debates in Japan because in the culture-specific background there is a norm which stands for less confrontation between the candidates. Institutional arrangements are, e.g., party-specific working methods, cultural traditions include for example the importance of political life and private life of president candidates for the public. Other contextual constraints for campaign styles are illustrated in regulatory frameworks like laws against specific campaigning methods like data mining and the media environment itself like the availability of free air-time on television. Mediating factors in specific countries which influence campaign practices can be characterized as institutional and regulatory factors in three important areas: Electoral system, party system and Mass mediamedia system. The following table shows the most important factors shaping the way of hybridization: Electoral system Party system Media system Types, levels and frequencies of elections Number of parties Dominant type of broadcasting system Election laws Fragmentation scores Possibility to buy air time on TV Candidate or party vote Party identification TV consumption Public vs. private funding of campaigns Party system polarization Daily newspaper reach Modus of voter registration Strength of parties Attitude of journalists towards politics Table 1:Mediating system factors Those factors shown in the table interact and shape the way of how the hybridization is practiced in a specific country and the cultural and practices of the existing campaigning culture in that country matter as well. The three top categories Electoral, Party and Media System show in which area the campaign practices are influenced. For example, data privacy protection is a high value in German society and law so the campaign practice of data sourcing is highly frowned upon there.  Earlier approaches  The shift and changes in political campaigning in different countries have been visible for a long time and there have been different explanations in research. Evolution of theoretical approaches = Media revolution = One of the earlier research approaches is the occurrence of a media revolution which came up with the rise of television.cf. Mancini, & Swanson, 1996. Media is seen here as a causal factor for changes in campaigning and political culture: “The mass media are assuming many of the information functions that political parties once controlled. Instead of learning about an election at a campaign rally or from party canvassers, the mass media have become the primary resource of campaign information”.Dalton & Wattenberg, 2000, p.11. = Modernization and marketing revolution = Another process that is seen as explanatory factor in research is modernization which includes “changes in political culture as a consequence of a prolonged, universal structural change in politics, society and media system”.Esser & Pfetsch, 2004, p.12. An example is the ongoing negativity of campaigning as a consequence of an endogenous change Plasser & Plasser, 2002, p. 17. i.e., changes in the specific country and culture. Often it is also used as a synonym for professionalizationMancini & Swanson, 1996, p.4. which means for example that major parties use more and more external consultants for campaigning.cf. Gibson & Römmele, 2006. Often the changes in campaigning are also called marketing revolution. In this approach, change in parties and their relationship to voters leads to the fact that “many major parties turned to experts in marketing and public relations, opinion polling, and other techniques to discover how they could effectively appeal to citizens”.Swanson, 2004, p.49. = Americanization = The most prominent approach to explain the diffusion of campaign practices is called Americanization. American campaigning acts as a role model and is the reason for convergence of political communication in Asia, Europe, Africa and Australia to American methods like for example the orientation at marketing strategies.Plasser & Plasser, 2002, p.16. The idea of convergence of campaigning “comprises a targeted, uni-linear diffusion of political communication practices from the United States to other countries”.Esser & Pfetsch, 2004, p.11. This approach contains several weak points, for example “it refers only to symptoms and practical patterns of political communication, whereas the institutions of the political system or the organizations and roles of media and political actors are neglected”. The change is caused only external in this approach but not from a social change inside the country and culture. = The Shopping and Adoption Model = To explain the global diffusion of American campaign and marketing techniques there have been two models, the Shopping and Adoption Model.Plasser, Scheucher & Senft, 1999, p.105. Both models take into respect that American aspects, practices and strategies of campaigning find resemblance in other country’s campaigning. Both use different perspectives to find the causal factors and future developments. The Adoption Model detects a standardization which will lead to a “gradual phase-out of country-specific traditional campaign styles and their substitution by capital-intensive, media- and consultant-driven campaign practices”.Plasser & Plasser, 2002, p.19. Today the Shopping Model is preferred because it focuses on the process of hybridization and proclaims a “country-specific supplementation of traditional campaign practices with select features of the American style of campaigning”. To summarize, the hybridization approach is the evolutionary explanation approach which arose from different earlier ones to explain changes in election campaigning.  Examples: hybridization around the world  Hybridization as a mixture of culture- and country-specific campaign methods and new practices from the U.S. or other countries like image management, which means the focus on the personality of a candidate, can be found in several countries. A number of concrete examples are listed in the following: = In Sweden = In his study Still the Middle Way: A Study of Political Communication Practices in Swedish Election Campaigns (2006) Lars W. Nord examines the change in Sweden in the light of hybridization. He discovers a mixed picture where media are becoming more important both as an arena and an actor in the political communication process.cf. Nord, 2006. “The transformation process in Sweden is, however, rather slow and does not correspond in any way to the dramatic changes taking place within the electorate and the media system”.Nord, 2006, p.73. Nord names several reasons for Sweden’s particular hybridization: First, he indicates that the political and electoral context in Sweden, which means a proportional and party-based electoral system, compromises “a possible global diffusion of campaign and marketing techniques based upon a two-party system and candidate centered”.Nord, 2006, p.74. Second the Swedish media structure is still politics-friendly and much time and space during election time is spend on more substantial political coverage than on power plays or scandals. As a last reason Nord names the political culture of Sweden where “political parties still thrive on party platforms and manifestos in their campaign activities, while they officially play down political marketing practices” because most of the members and voters expect that. In his conclusion Nord characterizes the hybridization of political communication practices in Sweden by a growing use of marketing tools, although he admits that substantial obstacles to the complete implementation of modern practices still exist. Therefore he identifies existing laws and regulations and, even more, public perceptions of parties, politics, and elections. Nord’s study shows a particular insight how hybridization can look like in a Western European country. = In Ecuador = To examine hybridization processes in a Latin American country, Corres de la Torre and Catherine Conaghan analyzed the election campaign race between presidency candidates Rafael Correa and Alvora Noboa in the year 2006.cf. de la Torre & Conaghan, 2009. They did a multi-level-analysis and looked at campaign practices of the candidates like mass rallies and the reports on the candidates in media like in TV shows or newspaper articles. Their results show that there is a hybrid nature of campaigning in Ecuador: They found that both candidates used esp. television as a platform to present their personalities and project negative images of the competitor (e.g. in a TV spot where the other one was pictured as reckless capitalist). Secondly they found a trend towards professionalization. Both candidates used political professionals with considerable experience in presidential elections. “Both camps employed the standard communications tactics, from ‘going negative’ on opponents to the endless repetition of simple, understandable messages as in Noboa’s promise of ‘jobs, jobs, and more jobs.’ The focus on media strategies, however, did not preclude more old-fashioned efforts at grassroots organizing; both organizations recognized the need to establish local networks of supporters for the ground war of political canvassing and getting out the vote on election Day\\".de la Torre & Conaghan, 2009, p.349. What both authors stress in their conclusion is that the hybridity in Ecuador is not only a hybridity in politics but also in public life which involves “the candidates’ intensive use of some of the most traditional political rhetorics and practices, namely populism and clientelism\\".de la Torre & Conaghan, 2009, p.350. = In Japan = In his study Japanese Lower House Campaigns in Tradition: Manifest Changes or Fleeting Fads? (2009) Patrick Koellner examined if there is temporal change in campaigning practices in Japan.cf. Koellner, 2009. Recently he noticed a significant change in campaigns, like the increasing use of voter-chasing strategies which was earlier very local becoming higher on a national level. For example parties started in 2003 to publish manifesto, i.e., central issues and election main topics, ahead of the election which was new for Japanese party but is an established practice for example in Western European countries. As a causal factor he names the growing number of independent voters in Japan who are no longer bound to any specific party, so a change in the electorate. He also identifies the mixed electoral system for the House of Representatives of Japan as reason for changing practices because in Japan the voting system for the Parliament has changed recently and so election campaigns did, too. Additionally, he names media- and technology-related developments as factors for new implementation of campaigning practices and comes to the conclusion that “the concurrence of elements of continuity and change in electioneering has led to a ‘hybridization’ of Lower House election campaigns\\".Koellner, 2009, p. 121.  Criticism  The wide concept of hybridization covers a broad variety of changes and gives a rough frame for different processes. However, still questions remain and further research is needed in several areas. As most important gap “a lack of clearly specified and standardized independent and dependent variables, and a lack of explanatory hypothesis-based analyses with large aggregated data sets”Esser & Strömbäck, 2012, p.304. can be identified. Another important factor which has to be analyzed further is the importance of new media practices especially in the light of changes in Arabic and African countries where institutional and social changes are taking place. And a constraint that should be considered when talking about hybridization is a conclusion Swanson and Mancini made: “it would be wrong to conclude that campaign practices in each country have followed paths which are completely unique\\".Swanson & Mancini, 1996, p.269.

Only Boys Aloud finished third in the Britain's Got Talent competition in May 2012 and released their debut album in November 2012. History Only Boys Aloud was founded in May 2010 by Tim Rhys-Evans. Rhys- Evans, who founded Only Men Aloud in 2000, brought 144 boys onstage to sing with Only Men Aloud at the opening of the National Eisteddfod in Ebbw Vale in 2010. According to Rhys-Evans, he intended to use this one-time event to gauge the level of interest in a Welsh boys' choir. The event led to the formation of an organization, the Aloud Charity, which funds Only Boys Aloud. Rhys-Evans \\"'noticed choirs were getting older and older, which went hand in hand with a breakdown in the traditional sense of community in South Wales'\\", and he desired to \\"'inject some new blood into the Welsh tradition of choir singing'\\". According to Rhys-Evans, he also wanted to help boys in economically depressed areas of Wales: \\"'Choral singing is a stronghold of the Valleys and I wanted to use it as a way of getting teenage boys doing something positive'\\". In December 2011, Only Boys Aloud joined forces with its father company, Only Men Aloud, to perform on the final night of Only Men Aloud's arena tour at the Motorpoint Arena Cardiff and also featured on their Christmas CD. They have been the subject of two TV documentaries and appeared on BBC's Songs of Praise. Only Boys Aloud have appeared at many events, including at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff with Dame Shirley Bassey and Catherine Zeta-Jones in the \\"Ryder Cup Welcome to Wales\\" concert. The choir gained publicity when they auditioned for the ITV talent show Britain's Got Talent. They performed \\"Calon Lân\\" in their audition, which was aired on the first audition episode on 24 March 2012. With support of all judges, they progressed to the semi-finals. In the semi-final, they performed \\"Gwahoddiad\\". After a split decision of the judges, the public vote sent them to the finals. In the final, on 12 May, they again performed \\"Calon Lân\\" and finished third in the competition. According to Wales Online, Only Boys Aloud \\"won over the nation when they took third place on ITV’s Britain’s Got Talent\\". In August 2012, it was announced that Only Boys Aloud had signed a record deal with Relentless Records–Sony Music. The news was announced at the opening concert of the National Eisteddfod in the Vale of Glamorgan. The choir's self-titled debut album was released in November 2012. \\"Calon Lân\\" went into the number one position on the iTunes classical singles chart and the choir developed a list of TV and radio credits, including This Morning, Songs of Praise, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire: Christmas Special, All Star Christmas Presents, and Stepping Out with Katherine Jenkins. In 2018, Only Boys Aloud released an album entitled A New Generation. As of September 2019, the Aloud Charity sponsored 14 choirs throughout Wales. Only Boys Aloud choirs do not require auditions and do not charge fees to members.

Appreciative advising is based on the organizational development theory of appreciative inquiry that was conceptualized in 1979 by David Cooperrider at Case Western Reserve University. Appreciative advising also draws from the positive psychology, social constructivist theory, and choice theory literature.  History  The appreciative advising model was first developed in article written by Jennifer L. Bloom and Nancy Archer Martin titled \\"Incorporating Appreciative Inquiry into Academic Advising\\" that appeared in the online academic advising journal at Penn State, The Mentor,The Mentor on August 29, 2002. Subsequently, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) began implementing the appreciative advising model and found that its advising approach contributed to student retention. Bloom, Hutson, and He (2008) developed the ideas further in the book The Appreciative Advising Revolution. In 2012, the University of South Carolina began offering an online appreciative advising course as well as a process for certifying appreciative advisers. Building on the success of the appreciative approach to academic advising, the framework has expanded to other areas, including teaching (appreciative college instruction), orientation, admissions, Greek life, and tutoring. This expansion of the principles of appreciative advising is now known as appreciative education.  Core  = The six phases = :Disarm :The Disarm phase involves making a positive first impression with students and allaying any fear or suspicion they might have of meeting with the advisor. :Discover :The Discover phase is spent continuing to build rapport with students and learning about their strengths, skills, and abilities through utilizing effective and positive open-ended questions that encourages narratives. :Dream :The Dream phase involves uncovering students' hopes and dreams for their futures. :Design :The Design phase is spent co-creating a plan to make their hopes and dreams come true. :Deliver :The Deliver phase is the implementation phase where students carry out their plan, and the advisor’s role is to support them as they encounter roadblocks. :Don't Settle :The Don't Settle phase involves challenging students to achieve their full potential and supporting them along their journey. Certification =Professional certification= The University of South Carolina's Office of Appreciative Education now offers a professional rating for academic advisers: Appreciative Advising Certification. Certified Appreciative Advisors are committed to a standard of excellence in the field of advising and optimizing their students' educational experiences. The certification process includes successful attendance of the Appreciative Advising Institute or completion of the appreciative advising course, as well as completed advising rubrics, recommendations, a current CV, and personal advising theory. =Benefits of certification= *Advanced professional qualification *Increased skills and knowledge *Raised professional expectations *Elevated advising experience for students =Appreciative Advising Institute= The Appreciative Advising Institute was first held in August 2011 in Las Vegas, Nevada. The 2012 Appreciative Advising Institute was held July 28–31 in Charleston, SC. The Institute is intentionally designed to teach participants the theoretical structure of appreciative advising and to provide skills training in implementing this framework. This conference is designed to provide ample opportunity for participants to extend theory to practice. Participants learn how the six phases help both the advisor and advisee optimize their educational experiences. =Appreciative Advising Course= The Appreciative Advising Course is designed to be a community of learners (instructors included). There are opportunities for participants to interact with other community members each week. This is done via discussion board conversations, as well as optional live chat dialogues. Active participants greatly enhance their own learning experience as well as that of the community. This is an eight-week course. Institutions using AA * University of North Carolina Greensboro ::Advising, adviser training, undergraduate academic courses, Appreciative Advising Inventory, and graduate-level ESL courses * University of North Carolina at Wilmington ::Advising, adviser training, TEAL Learning Community, and Academic Recovery Program * Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis ::Advising students on probation, workshops for students on probation, and adviser training * University of South Carolina at Columbia ::Advising students on probation, adviser training, Appreciative Advising Inventory, advising master's degree students in Higher Education and Student Affairs programs, and a graduate-level course that focuses on appreciative advising * Miami University Hamilton ::Advising all students, including probation students; advising syllabus; adviser training; and Appreciative Advising Inventory * Eastern Illinois University ::Advising adult and non- traditional students, electronic advising * Prairie State College ::Advising at-risk students, faculty and adviser training * Grand Valley State University ::Advising honors students and candidates for fellowships * Florida Atlantic University ::Advising traditional and non-traditional students, honors students, probation/suspension/at-risk students; advising syllabus, advisor training, workshop presentations  UNCG's usage  = Academic recovery programming = When students feel academically discouraged, such as when they are on academic probation, they may need to be reminded of the strengths that led them to college in the first place. Students in academic trouble also typically have a limited time in which to improve their status. Practically, it is quicker to correct this status by building on strengths and maintaining a course load and engaging in academic and social behaviors that reflect these strengths than it is to attempt to correct long-standing deficits. The SAS 100 program at UNCG features the use of the Appreciative Advising Inventory as the basis for three mandatory advising sessions and the use of appreciative advising questions in weekly reflections and discussions. All instructors are trained to use appreciative advising in their meetings with the students. After the appreciative approach was introduced, retention of SAS 100 students improved 18%. When control and treatment groups were compared, the treatment group achieved a statistically significant GPA gain of .73 (p=. 03) compared to the control group at .42. = Internal transfer advising = Appreciative advising can be used in internal transfer cases in which a student has realized that their current declared major may not be a good fit, but are struggling to identify a new major. Student Academic Services at UNCG has used appreciative advising to assist declared pre-nursing majors who have not met continuance requirements. This began as a pilot program in the spring of 2005, and currently includes all pre-nursing majors who have a cumulative GPA that has been identified as not competitive by the School of Nursing. The goal of the program is to help students explore their options, given that they are unlikely to be accepted into the School of Nursing. Of the 145 students served by the program during the spring and fall semesters of 2005, 30% have changed their major, while an additional 43% continue to receive advising through Student Academic Services. The mean GPA for participants has also improved dramatically. = First-year Experience Program = UNCG's First-Year Experience program is called University Studies 101 (UNS 101), and uses a curriculum emphasizing appreciative advising. One stated aim of the program is to assist students in discovering their purposes, identifying their strengths, and aligning these newly discovered assets with plans for their future. The activities, class discussions, and assignments used in the course guide students through the six appreciative advising stages. A comprehensive program evaluation which includes the tracking of academic outcomes and assessment of student attitudes and behaviors has evidenced the positive impact of the UNS 101 program (Hutson & Atwood, 2005). For example, the freshman to sophomore retention rate of freshmen who completed UNS 101 in fall 2006 and returned for fall 2007 was 81.9%. This compares to a retention rate of 74.4% for freshmen who did not take the course. Meanwhile, the average first semester GPA for students who did not take the course was 2.49, while UNS 101 participants had an average first semester GPA of 2.72.

It established that, in English trusts law, third parties could be liable for a breach of trust in two circumstances, referred to as the two 'limbs' of Barnes v Addy: knowing receipt and knowing assistance.Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan [1995] 2 AC 378, 382. Although the decision remains historically significant in common law countries, the House of Lords significantly revised the relevant equitable principles in cases such as Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan (1995) and Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam (2002). Statement of principle In Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan, the House of Lords described this passage as the \\"much-quoted dictum\\" in Barnes v Addy: Lord Selborne LC. This passage was adopted by the High Court of Australia as a statement of the 'rule in Barnes v Addy' in Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say- Dee Pty Ltd (2007).(2007) 230 CLR 89; [111]. Facts Henry Barnes appointed William Crush, John Lugar and John Addy to be testators and executors of his will. His money would be invested and then used as a £100 annuity for his widow, Ann, and his three daughters and son. John Addy, the sole remaining trustee, appointed another trustee, with an indemnity. Addy’s solicitors, including Mr William Duffield, had advised against appointing a sole trustee, but drew up the deeds of appointment and indemnity, introduced him to a stockbroker, and the broker transferred the trustee money. This trustee misapplied the trust property and became bankrupt. The children sued Addy and the solicitors. At first instance, Wickens VC held the solicitors were not liable for the trustee's breach. Judgment Lord Selborne LC held that neither of the solicitors had any knowledge of or reason to suspect dishonesty in the transaction. In any event, Barnes had not established a breach of trust by Addy: Sir W M James LJ and Sir G Mellish LJ agreed. Continuing significance Barnes v Addy was the starting point for the academic debate as to the proper grounds of accessory liability and claims for knowing receipt of trust property. Lord Nicholls revised the test for assistance liability in Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan (1995), whereby it is no longer necessary for the trustee to have acted dishonestly and instead the key element is that the third party acted dishonestly. This change was deemed necessary on the facts of Royal Brunei as the defendant was a sole director of a company who had caused the dishonest misapplication of trust property, but it had been held that the director's mental state would not be imputed to the company which had held the proceeds under trust. Writing extra-judicially, Lord Nicholls has also argued that the receipt limb of liability for third parties is based on unjust enrichment, a proposition which was decisively rejected by the High Court of Australia in Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd.

Facts In December 1923, the future tenth Duke of Manchester assigned his trustees, under clause 14, 'all articles of furniture plate pictures and other chattels' that he would be entitled to after the ninth Duke’s death, and under clause 14(B) the trustees should make an inventory of the chattels, which would be included in the settlement, and hold the residue for the future tenth Duke absolutely. When the ninth Duke died in February 1947 the trustees did not make the inventory, and released them to the tenth Duke. His solicitor knew that this was not following clause 14(B), but said in a letter on 15 November 1948 that he was free to sell the items. The Duke sold some. He died in 1977. The eleventh Duke brought a claim for breach of trust by failing to make any selection or an inventory of the chattels, and release them all to the tenth Duke, who was a constructive trustee when he received them. Judgment Sir Robert Megarry VC held that the solicitor’s knowledge of clause 14(B) should not be imputed to the tenth Duke so as to affect his conscience. Even if the tenth Duke had known, he probably would not have remembered when he received the chattels. So although the trustees were in breach of their fiduciary duty in 1948, the Duke had received nothing as a constructive trustee. The touchstone of liability is unconscionability. There is a defence if one knows of a breach but genuinely forgets before receipt. One must have, at least, wilfully and recklessly failed to make inquiries that an honest person would. In his view there are some people who, though not sufficiently innocent to not be bona fide purchasers for value, they may not be sufficiently guilty or knowledgeable to be knowing recipients.

Covering an area of pasture the lease provides good grazing land. In 2015 it was purchased by Bettini Bros, now Bettini Beef, in a package with Mallina and Pyramid Stations. The Bettinis still owed the lease in 2018 Sherlock is operating under the Crown Lease number CL311-1966 and has the Land Act number LA3114/558. The homestead was placed on the register of the National Estate in 1986. The homestead complex is composed of the main homestead, the kitchen block, meat-house, storeroom, quarters, stables, wool-shed and overseer's house all spread apart in a typical Pilbara layout. The main buildings are constructed from rubble masonry and have corrugated iron roofs mostly with Pilbara vaulting. In 1879 John and Emma Withnell bought the station after selling Mount Welcome Station. They retired to Guildford in 1890. Emma Withnell was known as Mother of the North West among the aborigines in the area as she often tended to the sick and delivered babies in her own house. 1882 was a dry year on the station when John Withnell contracted a Mr Lock to cut 7,500 fencing posts and erect of boundary fencing. The station was sold by John Withnell Snr. to Messrs Meares and Withnell in 1890 for the figure of £24,000. The cost included all of the plant and equipment, 16,000 sheep, 50 head of cattle and 60 horses. A large grassfire occurred at the station in 1893 when a station hand accidentally started it when lighting a campfire. The fire cost Withnell and Meares a paddock long that has been destocked for 6 months in preparation for lambing. The station suffered damage to the homestead, stables and outbuildings along with the loss of 8,000 sheep following a storm and resulting floods in 1894. A devastating cyclone tore through the area in 1898, with an aboriginal woman being swept away along with her mia in the resulting flood waters. The shearing shed was also washed away with both the Sherlock and Balla Balla rivers being in full flood. Meares and Withnell lost a large number of stock but the homestead was undamaged. Another storm followed in 1902, the station received about in the deluge. The nearby town of Balla Balla was almost submerged as the sea level rose to be almost level with the town. Following a dry year, in 1908, 4,000 wethers were sold from the station. J. G. Meares sold his share of the station in 1910 to Samuel Peter Mackay and bought the nearby Pyramid Station. In 1912 two kangaroo hunters, Carl Hedman and Frank Deschow, were arrested at the station for sheep stealing. The station had a bumper season in 1913 when good rains fell across the district. Grasses growing over one foot and good lambing numbers were reported at Sherlock and surrounding stations, Pyramid and Malina. A flock of over 10,000 sheep were overlanded to Lower Clifton Downs Station. Ernest A. Hall acquired the station in 1916 from Sam Mackay Hall had previously owned Croydon Station before purchasing Sherlock. In 1923 Hall sold Sherlock to Edward Meares and acquired Wooramel Station. Good rains fell at the station in 1928 with falling in one day that year. The station was sold in 1938 for an undisclosed amount by Messers A.E. Hardie and Son, the property carried 15,000 sheep, plant and homestead. Cyclone Shirley struck the Pilbara coast in April 1966 and dumped of rain on the station . In December 1999 Cyclone John also flooded the area when over of rain fell. The Keller family owned the station from the 1970s through to 1990. The station was owned during the 2000s until 2015 by Peter Cook, a pharmacist, who own also four other stations in the Pilbara including Croydon, Mallina and Pyramid Stations.

It was most famous for giving rise to the \\"Baden scale\\" or the \\"Baden knowledge scale\\" following on from the judgment of Peter Gibson J as to the five different types of relevant knowledge in knowing assistance cases. The use of the Baden scale has since fallen out of judicial favour in the United Kingdom.See where Lord Nicholls referred to knowledge as a \\"gradually darkening spectrum\\" rather than five separate compartments (in the context of dishonest assistance). Facts Mr Georges Baden, Jacques Delvaux and Ernest Lecuit were liquidators of the Luxembourg Mutual Investment Fund (FOF Proprietary Funds Ltd, along with a fund of funds, Venture Fund (International) NV, and IOS Growth Fund Ltd, all mutual 'dollar funds'). They claimed that Société Générale owed it $4,009,697.91, which it held for its customer, the Bahamas Commonwealth Bank Ltd in a trust account. On 10 May 1973, it followed BCB's instructions, in arrangement with Algemene Bank, Amsterdam, transferred the money to Banco Nacional de Panama, to a non-trust account in BCB's name. This, claimed Baden, made Société Générale a constructive trustee, and so had a duty to account. Alternatively, Société Générale was claimed to owe a duty of care, and to be liable in damages for the loss suffered. Judgment Peter Gibson J held that Société Générale was not liable because it had no knowledge at the time of the fraud in which it assisted. The relevant knowledge had to be knowledge of the facts. Recklessly refraining to make enquiries that a reasonable banker would have made would be enough. But otherwise a banker had a primary obligation to comply with instructions, save in exceptional circumstances, in which it came under a duty of enquiry.

Facts The liquidators of BCCI sued Chief Labode Onadimaki Akindele, a Nigerian businessman, for $6,679,226 that he got in divestiture payments in 1988. ICIC Overseas Ltd, in the BCCI group, had agreed Akindele would buy shares in BCCI Holdings, and be guaranteed a 15% pa return for a $10m investment. BCCI, in fact, gave him $16.679m to do this, thus leaving $6.679m over. Akindele did not know this was part of a fraud scheme to enable BCCI Holdings to buy its own shares. The liquidator argued he was a constructive trustee, for both knowing receipt and knowing assistance. The liquidators argued his dishonesty could be inferred from his knowledge of the artificially arranged loan transactions and his unusually high-interest rate of 15%. The High Court refused recovery and refused to find him dishonest.[1999] BCC 669 Judgment Nourse LJ held that Mr Akindele’s knowledge in 1985 was not enough to make the transaction unconscionable, and for him to retain the benefits of the divestiture payments, even though there were rumours about BCCI’s management. There was nothing to alert Mr Akindele to the transaction being tainted. Dishonesty was not needed to establish liability for knowing receipt as a constructive trustee, Belmont Finance Corp v Williams Furniture Ltd (No 2) [1980] 1 All ER 393 considered. The degrees of knowledge in Baden was unhelpful and a single test of unconscionability was better.

Program administration for this organization moved to Purdue University in 2018.  Background and History  Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant is one of 33 member institutions of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's National Sea Grant College Program. The National Sea Grant College Program fosters \\"scientific research, education, training, and extension projects geared toward the conservation and practical use of the coasts, Great Lakes, and other marine areas.\\" Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant is a collaboration between the University of Illinois and Purdue University, and focuses on education, research, and outreach efforts in the southern Lake Michigan region - an area of approximately 104 miles of shoreline contained in the two states. Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant began in April, 1982, as a joint venture between extension specialists and faculty at the University of Illinois and Purdue University in Indiana. The proposal that created the program under the National Sea Grant organization emphasized education and public engagement related to Lake Michigan. Over the years, the program has grown to include research and communication elements, with a continued emphasis on educational efforts. Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant \\"brings together scientists, educators, policy makers, community decision makers, outreach specialists, business leaders, and the general public to focus on coastal issues in the southern Lake Michigan region.\\" The program supports this mission by funding research, engaging in direct outreach to communities, developing educational materials, offering workshops and training for educators, and engaging in direct research efforts (where applicable) all related to Great Lakes issues. Some of the areas of work include invasive species research and prevention, water use planning, freshwater science education, ecosystem cleanup and remediation, and several other areas. Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant also produces a regular newsletter, \\"The Helm,\\" highlighting projects and accomplishments centered on preserving and protecting Lake Michigan's shoreline, communities, water, and wildlife. Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant celebrated its 30th anniversary in April, 2012.  Selected Issues and Areas of Work  = Aquatic Invasive Species = Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant has funded research, produced publications and educational materials, and performed public outreach projects related to monitoring and preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS) throughout the southern Lake Michigan area. There are numerous species of both plants and animals that can be considered invasive, but special attention has been paid in recent years to Asian carp, Eurasian watermilfoil, round goby, zebra mussels, and other plants and animals that can have a negative impact on ecology, industry, and public health in and around Lake Michigan. = Coastal Restoration = Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant partners with a number of local, regional, and federal agencies to help restore watersheds, rivers, shorelines, and other areas that have been identified by the U.S. EPA as contaminated or in need of restoration. The Great Lakes Legacy Act (PDF) “provides funding to take the necessary steps to clean up contaminated sediment in 'Areas of Concern located wholly or partially in the United States,' including specific funding designated for public outreach and research components.” Illinois- Indiana Sea Grant has been involved in holding numerous events to inform local communities about these projects, seek their input on potential impacts to their area, and keep them aware of the schedule and progress being made as well as the benefits. Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant has also produced publications, videos, and other media that help communicate the goals and accomplishments of such remediation projects. = Water Contamination = Another area of primary concern is the contamination of Lake Michigan (the main source of freshwater for over 40 million people in dozens of communities) by common household chemicals, medications, personal care products, lawn care chemicals, and more. Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant has helped several communities establish medicine collection events and permanent medicine disposal locations to prevent prescription and over-the-counter medications from entering local water supplies and impacting local and regional ecosystems. Previous advice on disposing of these substances had recommended flushing them, but recent research has found that they persist in water supplies and can enter the environment. Partnering with the DEA and U.S. EPA has allowed communities to collect these substances, especially “controlled substances,” which have specific requirements about their transfer and disposal. In addition, IISG's website \\"How to Dispose of Unwanted Medicine & Personal Care Products\\" provides information for communities and the public on proper disposal methods, events and drop-off locations, and how to start a collection event in their own area. Similarly, both ground and surface water can be contaminated by common lawn care products due to run-off or excessive application. For instance, in most areas near southern Lake Michigan, lawns often don’t require additional nitrogen, but many fertilizers contain the substance. The excess can enter various water supplies where it can lead to excessive algal blooms or water contamination. This has prompted the creation of IISG's Lawn to Lake program, designed to promote \\"healthy lawn and landscape practices to protect water resources in the Great Lakes region.\\" = Water Supply Use/Planning = Urban and suburban growth requires a larger and sustainable supply of clean water. While Lake Michigan would appear to be an abundant resource, lower rainfall and population increases are considerations in planning for both the present and future needs served by this freshwater supply. Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant has partnered with agencies such as the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning to fund and facilitate water management research, planning tools and procedures, and other necessary information for decision makers.

Facts Salaam's solicitors were seeking contribution for damages because of their former client. Mr Salaam had defrauded Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd. Mr Salaam's solicitors were Amhurst Brown Martin & Nicholson, and they had drafted documents for him. Amhurst's had been sued and had settled a $10m claim. Then, they sought contribution from Mr Salaam under the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978. This required showing that Amhurst's was liable for wrongful acts by Mr Anthony Amhurst, under the Partnership Act 1890 section 10. Judgment =Court of Appeal= The majority of the Court of Appeal,[2001] QB 113 Evans LJ and Aldous LJ, held that the firm was not vicariously liable for the dishonest acts of Mr Salaam, and so was not entitled to a contribution from Mr Salaam for settling the claim by Dubai Aluminium. Turner J dissented. Mr Salaam argued that wrongful acts that a partnership was vicariously liable for only extended to common law torts, not equitable wrongs like dishonest participation in a breach of trust. Jonathan Sumption QC acted for the solicitors. =House of Lords= The House of Lords held that Amhurst's was entitled to a contribution (which amounted to indemnity) from Mr Salaam. The 1890 Act was not restricted to tortious wrongs, and Mr Amhurst's actions were in the ordinary course of the business (Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd). So the firm was jointly liable for the damage, and Rix J had been wrong to take account of the firm's innocence when assessing Mr Salaam's contribution for a settlement. Given that Mr Salaam still possessed the proceeds of fraud it was equitable for him to pay the surplus for the firm's $10m liability. Lord Nicholls gave the first judgment and said the following on vicarious liability: Lord Millett gave a concurring judgment. In obiter dicta he said that the claim could be based on dishonesty, like for liability in assisting breach of trust. At the same time it could ‘be based simply on the receipt, treating it as a restitutionary claim independent of any wrongdoing.’ Lord Hobhouse gave a short concurring judgment. Lord Slynn agreed with Lord Nicholls. Lord Hutton agreed with Lord Nicholls and Lord Millett.

Facts Royal Brunei Airlines appointed Borneo Leisure Travel Sdn Bhd to be its agent for booking passenger flights and cargo transport around Sabah and Sarawak. Mr Tan was Borneo Leisure Travel's managing director and main shareholder. It was receiving money for Royal Brunei, which was agreed to be held on trust in a separate account until passed over. But Borneo Leisure Travel, with Mr Tan's knowledge and assistance, paid money into its current account and used it for its own business. Borneo Leisure travel failed to pay on time, the contract was terminated, and it went insolvent. Royal Brunei claimed the money back from Mr Tan.See the headnote of the Appeal Cases report, at [1995] UKPC 4, [1995] 2 AC 378 The Judge held Mr Tan was liable as a constructive trustee to Royal Brunei. The Court of Appeal of Brunei Darussalam held that the company was not guilty of fraud or dishonesty, and so Mr Tan could not be either. The case was appealed to the Privy Council, where the Privy Council found in favour of the claimant, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal. Advice Giving the advice of the Privy Council, Lord Nicholls held it was the dishonest assistant's state of mind which matters. Knowledge depends on a ‘gradually darkening spectrum’. Therefore, the test for being liable in assisting breach of trust must depend on dishonesty, which is objective. It is irrelevant what the primary trustee's state of mind is, if the assistant is himself dishonest. Lord Goff, Lord Ackner, Lord Steyn and Sir John May concurred.

Facts Barlow Clowes International Ltd was in liquidation, after its fraudulent securities scheme was exposed. It took £140m of investors’ money, and paid it into an Isle of Man company where Mr Henwood was a director. The liquidator of Barlow Clowes argued that Mr Henwood had dishonestly assisted the dissipation of the investors’ money. The deemster (judge on the Isle of Man) held that Mr Henwood was dishonest. The Court of Appeal held that Mr Henwood was not dishonest, and there was no evidence by which the deemster could have found this. Her disbelief at Mr Henwood’s oral testimony and her inferences were not enough. Advice Lord Hoffmann held Mr Henwood was liable, and the deemster had correctly applied the principles of liability for dishonest assistance. She had stated that Mr Henwood suspected the funds were misappropriated money, and (disapproving Brinks Ltd v Abu-Saleh (No 3) [1996] CLC 133) a person could know and suspect money was being misappropriated and thus be liable without knowing the money was held on trust or even knowing what a trust meant.

During the French Revolutionary Wars she spent some years on the Oporto station, where she captured many small privateers. The French captured her in 1806, early in the Napoleonic Wars. They lengthened her and she became the 17-gun privateer Duquesne. In 1807 the British recaptured her and the Royal Navy returned her to service as the 12-gun gun-brig HMS Unique. She was expended in an unsuccessful fire ship attack at Guadeloupe in 1809. Design Netley was built to a design by Sir Samuel Bentham. She was a modified and somewhat enlarged version of , which was a somewhat smaller version of his Dart-class vessels. Bentham's designs featured little sheer, negative tumblehome, a large-breadth to length ratio with structural bulkheads, and sliding keels. They were also virtually double-ended. French Revolutionary Wars Netley was commissioned in 1798 under the command of Lieutenant Francis Godolphin Bond. Her first recorded prize occurred on 25 September 1798 when she took the French sloop Clementine. =1799= On 1 May 1799, Netley captured Egyptienne, a French privateer schooner. She was pierced for 14 guns but only carried eight, four of which she had thrown overboard while trying to evade capture. She had only 35 men on board, having recently taken four neutral vessels as prizes. Netley had herself recaptured one of these, a galiot carrying a cargo of wine from Oporto. Netley also recaptured an English brig that had been carrying a cargo of provisions from Cork to Oporto when a French privateer lugger had taken her off Viana the day before. Next, on 14 June during a cruise out of Oporto, Netley recaptured a brig that had been sailing from Lisbon to Oporto when taken. The next day, Netley took possession of a schooner carrying corn. The day after that, Netley took possession of a second schooner carrying corn. All three vessels were part of a Portuguese convoy from Lisbon that had fallen prey to a French privateer. Lastly, Netley burnt a coaster at Vigo and ran a brig ashore a little north of that. On 14 October, Netley recaptured a brig that had been sailing from Gibraltar carrying brandy. Netley dropped a boat to take possession of the prize, and immediately set out after her captor. Netley was able to prevent the privateer from entering Bayonne, though Netley had to exchange a few shots with the fort there. Netley captured the privateer, which turned out to be a Spanish schooner from Muros called O'Reilly y Los Tres Amigos. The privateer was armed with four carriage guns and four brass 3-pounder swivel guns, and had a crew of 52 men. Because the number of prisoners exceeded the number of men Bond had left aboard Netley, Bond dropped them off at Oporto and turned them over to the Spanish consul there, who gave Bond a receipt for the men. On 28 November Netley was off Lisbon when she sent into port several prizes ahead of her. She was towing the packet ship Walsingham, which was delaying her entry. The prizes included two Spanish privateer luggers she had captured, one on the 14th and one that very day, and another lugger that had captured on the 24th within sight of Netley and that Captain Gower of Castor had requested that Bond take with him to port. Bond also reported that he had recaptured two brigs that had been taken while sailing from Newfoundland. On 22 December Netley captured Esperance, of Viana. Espereance was a French privateer lugger, formerly a privateer from Guernsey. She was pierced for 12 gun but only mounting five, and had a crew of 36 men. The next day Netley encountered and Captain Sir Henry Neale passed on to Bond the information that three convoys had become dispersed along the Portuguese coast and that the vessels had been unable to get into Douro for the previous 20 days. Weather conditions having improved, Bond therefore decided to sail to intercept any prizes attempting to get into Vigo. On the morning of 24 December, Netley recaptured the Hamburg brig Catharina, which had been sailing from Oporto to Cork Limerick with a cargo of wine and fruit when she was taken. That night, after a short chase, Netley captured a small Spanish privateer lugger. This was Felicidad, of two guns, eight swivels, and 22 men. Before Netley had finished taking her prisoners on board, she spotted another privateer, and the privateer's prize. At 1 a.m. on 25 January Netley retook the bark Dutchess of Gordon which had been transporting 7,600 quintals of salt fish from Newfoundland to Oporto. By 10 a.m., after a short chase, Netley captured the Spanish privateer schooner St Antonio y Animas (alias Aurora). She was armed with six guns and had a crew of 46 men. At the same time, Netley recaptured the privateer's prize, Venus, which had been carrying shot, lead, tin, staves, and the like from London to Oporto. Venus, Humphries, master, was reported to have arrived at Oporto after her recapture. On 27 December, Netley recaptured three more vessels. One was the English brig Commerce, which was carrying a cargo of salt fish. The second was a Swedish brig that had been carrying iron and deals (fir or pine boards) from Stockholm to Viana before a French lugger had captured her. The third vessel was a Portuguese schooner carrying a cargo of salt. The evening of the next day the weather began to worsen. =1800= On 8 January Netley had to leave behind near the shore Commerce, which had stayed with her. Commerce had no usable sails, and the wind forced Netley to sail away from the shore. Commerce, Bibbins, master, was again captured. This time her captor sent her into Vigo.LL 21 February 1800, №4026. The next day Netley also encountered the West Indiaman Trojan, which had lost much of her rigging and contact with her convoy. She was attempting to reach Lisbon to refit. Netley stayed with her through almost continuous storms until the 21st, and then saw her into port on the 27th. At some point Netley recaptured Liberty, Bly, master, which a Spanish privateer had captured off Porto Bar. Netley made a cartel of Liberty and sent her into Bayonne. There Bly rejoined her to sail her for Oporto. Unfortunately, bad weather cost Netley most of her prizes and some of her crew. Dutchess of Gordon was wrecked near Lisbon. All but one of the people aboard was lost, including Netleys pilot. Two brigs arrived safe, and two others had to take refuge in Vigo, i.e., in an enemy port. The French lugger stranded attempting to cross the bar at Viana, but without loss of life. On 20 February, Netley recaptured the Portuguese vessel Carmo y Diligente. On 7 March Netley recaptured a brig from Brazil. Two days later she recaptured a ship from Brazil carrying a cargo of cotton, rice, and the like, and a brig, also from Brazil, with a like cargo. Eight days later, Netley captured the Spanish privateer Pedro Apostle (alias Escariote), of five guns and 37 men. Next, Netley captured the American brig Nymph on 26 March. Nymph was carrying pilchards from Penzance to Naples. On 18 April Netley captured San Francisco e San Antonio el Lebre. On 15 May, Netley and the frigate captured the French privateer cutter Vengeance. Vengeance was armed with 15 guns and had a crew of 132 men. The next day Netley captured another privateer, the Spanish lugger Animas el sola (alias Desquite), or Animas Sola el Desquits. At the end of the month, on 29 May, Netley recaptured the \\"Hambro ship\\" Junge Lieppe, which was carrying staves and wheat. Two days later Netley recaptured the French privateer lugger Legere. Legere was armed with three guns, had a crew of 40 men, and was on a cruise from Jean de Luz. In August, Netley made a particularly valuable capture. On 11 August she captured the Spanish ship Reyna Luisa (or Reina Luisa), which was carrying cocoa, wool and £12,000 in bullion from Montevideo to Corunna. From 7 to 11 September, Netley escorted a convoy safely from Lisbon to Oporto. Then on the 28th, she captured the Spanish privateer Nostra Senora del Carmen La Confianza, of two guns and 26 men. The lugger Nostra Senora del Carmen La Connianza was on a cruise from Vigo. She was armed with two guns and had a crew of 26 men. Then on 16 October, Netley recaptured the brig Mary, from Dublin, and the Portuguese government 7-gun lugger Lial Invicta Vianna. A French 14-gun privateer had captured both the day before. A Spanish rowboat had cut Mary out from under the guns of Fort Saint John on 14 October. The Portuguese governor had sent Lial Invicta Vianna to retrieve her when they encountered the French privateer which, after an action of half an hour, had captured the Portuguese lugger. Netleys crew returned Lial Invicta Vianna to his Excellency M. Pedro de Millo free of salvage. Mary had been carrying 169 casks of butter and some coals from Dublin to Oporto. November yielded three more prizes. On the 8th, Netley captured Spanish privateer schooner St Miguel (alias Alerta), from Ponte Vedra. The privateer was armed with nine guns, 6 and 18-pounders, and had a crew of 65 men. That same day, Netley recaptured her prize, the English brig Hunter, which had been carrying fish from Newfoundland to Lisbon. Netley dropped off her boat to recapture the brig, and sailed up alongside St Miguel, dropped anchor, and captured her without a shot being fired.James (1837), Vol. 3, pp.57-8. Lastly, on 18 November Netley sailed from Lisbon and five days later captured the Spanish privateer lugger St Antonio y Animas La Fortuna, of six guns and 34 men. On 11 December Netley captured St Miguel El Volante, of two guns and 29 men. Then in the next three days Netley retook the brig Speedy, carrying cod fish from Newfoundland, and captured a Spanish coaster carrying wine, and the Spanish privateer schooner Pedro y San Francisco, of three guns and 39 men. These were Bond's last captures. On 11 December he received promotion to Commander. In all, under Bond Netley captured some 45 prizes, including 19 armed privateers. Reina Luisa was valued for purposes of prize money at £24,000. If Bond received the full ⅜ due the captain of the capturing vessel(s), his share would have been £9,000, or an amount equivalent to over 20 years pay for a senior captain (in rank). This would have been in addition to the prize money for all his other captures. =1801= In January Lieutenant James Mien replaced Bond. On 29 January, Netley sailed with the responsibility of protecting a convoy sailing north from Lisbon. On 3 February she encountered four privateers. She was able to capture one after a chase of two hours. The capture privateer was a Spanish lugger called Santa Victoria. Santa Victoria was armed with six guns and had a crew of 26 men. Netley was unable to catch any of the other privateers because of the necessity of protecting her convoy, which had sighted an enemy vessel to windward. The next month, on 9 February, Netley was nine leagues SW of Oporto when she captured the Spanish privateer lugger St Francisco de Paula. The privateer was armed with two carriage guns and four swivel guns, and had a crew of 31 men. She was on a cruise out of Pontevedra. Two days later, Netley captured the Spanish privateer San Josef (alias Belos), on a cruise out of Corunna. San Josef was armed with four guns and four swivels, and had a crew of 55 men. That same day Netley recaptured a British brig that had been taken while sailing in ballast from Southampton to Oporto, and a British snow, also sailing in ballast, but from London to Oporto. On the 16th, Netley captured the Spanish lugger Nostra Santa del Carmen, sailing with a cargo of wine and sardines from Vigo to Ferrol. Four days later Netley recaptured the snow Edward and Mary, which had been sailing from Oporto to Falmouth with a cargo of beef, pork, and coals. Next, Netley shared with and in the capture on 23 June of the Purissima Concepcion. On 17 October Netley captured the Spanish ship Santissima Trinidada (alias Casualidad. In early 1802 Netley was in Portsmouth, in ordinary. Lieutenant John Lawrence recommissioned her in May. He then sailed her to the Leeward Island on 17 November. Napoleonic Wars On 21 August 1803, and Netley captured the American ship Fame and her cargo of flour and corn. Then in September, Commodore Samuel Hood went on to take the colonies of Demerara and Essequibo from the Batavian Republic. Netley went ahead with a Mr. Casey, who knew the coast, to reconnoitre and to find boats to carry the troops. Lawrence was able to find 24 boats and have them ready by the time Centaur, , , , and the transport Brilliant arrived.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 10, p.501. On 20 September , Netley and 200 troops entered the Demerara River and took possession of Fort William Frederick. At the capitulation, the British took over the Batavian Republic's sole warship there, . At some point Lieutenant William Sanders replaced Lawrence. Lawrence then transferred to Hornet. Lieutenant William Autridge of Centaur replaced him. On 19 May 1804 Netley captured a French sloop (name unknown), carrying provisions. In August, Netley captured the French schooner Bellona. She too was carrying provisions. In October 1804, or perhaps earlier, Lieutenant William Carr, of , replaced Lawrence, who transferred to . On 4 October, Netley captured a small privateer, the French felucca San Benita, of one gun and 28 men. In June 1805 Netley was under the command of Lieutenant Richard Harward, albeit briefly.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, p.32. While under his command she was in company with as they escorted a convoy of 15 merchant vessels back to Britain. They had the misfortune on 8 June to encounter a Franco-Spanish fleet under Admiral Villeneuve. The two British warships managed to escape, but Villeneuve's fleet captured the entire convoy, valued at some five million pounds. He sent the convoy to Guadeloupe under the escort of the frigate .James (1837), Vol. 3, p.351. On her way Sirène encountered several British frigates. She escaped after burning the merchantmen.Lloyd's List №4252. Capture and recapture On 17 December 1806, the French frigate Thétis and the brig Sylphe captured Netley. Netley, again under the command of Lieutenant William Carr, had sighted two strange sails. Believing them, from their appearance, to be a French privateer and her prize. Netley started to distance herself when the two identified themselves as a frigate and a sloop. They opened fire and during the engagement Netley had one man killed. More critically, she started taking on water, and could not bring her guns to bear, the gun ports on the lee side being under water. The French sold Netley and she became the privateer Duquesne. Less than nine months later, on 23 September 1807, HMS Blonde captured Dusquesne. Two days earlier, Duquesne had captured the brig Jassyes, of Dublin, which had been sailing to Barbados in ballast. Captain Volant Vashon Ballard of Blonde remarked that the French had performed a complete repair on Netley, including lengthening her. He recommended that she be taken back into the Royal Navy. By this time the Royal Navy had commissioned a recently captured French privateer under the name , so Duquesne became the 12-gun gun-brig HMS Unique. HMS Unique Lieutenant Murray commissioned Unique at Antigua. Lieutenant Thomas Fellowes took command of Unique on 13 November 1808. On 11 November, , , and captured Intrepid. Nine days later, Amaranthe, Circe, , Epervier and Unique captured the American ships and Mary and Allen. Prize money for Intrepid and Bonetta was paid in 1814, and 1839. In April 1809, a strong French squadron arrived at the Îles des Saintes, south of Guadeloupe. There they were blockaded until 14 April, when a British force under Major-General Frederick Maitland and Captain Philip Beaver in , invaded and captured the islands. Unique was among the naval vessels that shared in the proceeds of the capture of the islands. Unique was also among the many vessels that shared in the proceeds of the capture on 17 April 1809 of the French ship Hautpoult. Fate On 21 May 1809, Fellowes and Unique were at Basse Terre as part of a squadron under Captain Philip Beaver of . They sighted a French schooner sheltering under the protection of some guns, and recognized the vessel as one that had sailed under their protection for several days while flying the Swedish flag. Beaver sent in Unique and to try and cut her out, but she was stuck fast on shore. Fellowes then led a party of 24 men ashore to spike an enemy battery's guns despite being opposed by a large French regular force; in the attack one man was killed, a midshipman from Julia, and seven men were seriously wounded. Of the remaining men, all but Fellowes were at least lightly wounded; he was the only unwounded man to return from the raid.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, pp. 320-1. In May 1809, British ships chased two French frigates, armed en flûte and bringing supplies to Martinique, into the Basse Terre roads. The British set up a blockade, trapping the Félicité and Furieuse in their shelter. By this time Unique, was in poor condition - in particular she was leaky, in part from the constant firing of her guns at shore batteries. The decision was made to use her as a fireship in an attempt to destroy one or both of the French vessels. On 31 May she was sent in during the evening but the mission failed. Having been lightened of most of her stores, Unique was vulnerable to gusts of wind, and she grounded not far from one of her targets. Fellowes then set fire to a train of explosives to prevent her falling into French hands.Marshall (1828), Supple. Par 2, pp.318-323. On 16 September Fellowes received a promotion to Commander. Félicité and Furieuse escaped some time later, only to end up being captured: Félicité by on 7 June 1809, Furieuse by on 5 July 1809.

Facts Before he died, Mr Tang Man Sit signed a deed to assign houses to Capacious Investments Ltd. Later, he let them, without Capacious knowing. Capacious sought a declaration that Mr Tang Wing Hon Alan, Mr Tang's personal representative, should assign back the house free of incumbrances, account for the profits from the lease, and pay the profits over. It should also compensate for losses from use and occupation of the house, with a deduction for profits, and damages to the fall in the house value, as a result of the wrongful occupation. The Court of Appeal of Hong Kong held that Capacious Investments Ltd had elected to get a remedy for restitution, and so could not recover damages for wrongful occupation as well. Both appealed. Judgment Lord Nicholls held that Capacious Investments Ltd could recover damages for loss of market rental value, and loss resulting from overuse and deterioration of the houses. It was true that remedies for loss of profits, and damages for loss of use and occupation were alternatives. However, Capacious had made no election when the judge made the order for profits and damages. It could proceed to claim for an assessment of damages, to see how much that would be, and then make an election. Lord Keith, Lord Lloyd, Lord Steyn and Hardie Boys J agreed.

Henry Borwin I was a son of Pribislaw and his wife, Woizlava of Pomerania, daughter of Wartislaw I, Duke of Pomerania. Pribislav was an Obotrite prince and was the first Lord of Mecklenburg. He died on 30 December 1178 of a wound he received during a tournament at the court of Henry the Lion in Lüneburg, and Henry Borwin I succeeded him as Lord of Mecklenburg. Shortly before Pribislav's death, Henry Borwin I married Matilda, a daughter of Henry the Lion. For several years, Henry Borwin I fought a war with his cousin Nicholas I. His father-in-law was unable to assist him during this war. This lack of outside assistance attracted the attention of King Canute VI of Denmark, who used the situation to expand his position on the Baltic Sea coast. The Danes took Henry Borwin I prisoner. He had to cede Rostock to Denmark and accept Canute VI as his liege lord. In 1200, Canute returned Rostock to him as a fief. In 1202, he fought on the Danish side in the Battle of Stellau. The Danes won, and Henry Borwin was rewarded with two more fiefs: Gadebusch and Ratzeburg. In 1218 and 1219, he assisted in the Danish conquest of Estonia, and, from 1225 to 1227, he assisted them in a war against Schauenburg. Henry Borwin I revived the cities of Rostock and Wismar and founded the abbeys of Dobbertin, Tempzin and Sonnenkamp.  Marriage and issue  Henry Borwin I married twice.

They have faced serious allegations of patient abuse and use of patients for unfree labor. Cenikor provides treatment based on the therapeutic community approach. History =1960s= Cenikor was founded in 1967 by James \\"Luke\\" Austin while incarcerated at Colorado State Penitentiary. Austin had previously worked at the new religious movement Synanon in California, and initially sought to start a Synanon spinoff group for Colorado prisoners. When his request to start a group under the Synanon name was rejected by prison leaders, Austin renamed the group Center of the Core of the Individual, shortened to \\"Cenikor,\\" and reframed Synanon's confrontational attack therapy approach as reality therapy. After Austin's release, he married Doris \\"Dottie\\" Austin, and the two formally incorporated Cenikor on May 27, 1968. The first major facility, housed in a former bakery in Denver, Colorado, was financed by a donation from businessman Charles Kettering III. =1970s= William Penn Hotel in downtown Houston The Austins moved Cenikor to Houston, Texas in 1972, where the organization expanded rapidly via private philanthropy.

Board members Ken Barun, Doug Sadbury, and Edward Fresquez took over leadership of the organization. In July 1978, Luke Austin and several other individuals, including his mother Helen Thompson, were arrested for attempting a violent takeover of Cenikor's Houston and Denver facilities. In 1977, Cenikor signed a year-round contract with the Astrodomain Corporation, establishing the Cenikor Astrodome Task Force, in which Cenikor patients perform painting, maintenance, field changeovers, and event set-ups at the Astrodome, the Astrohall, and the Astroarena complexes, with as much as three-quarters of Cenikor's monthly budget coming from this contract.\\"Strike taking toll on cities’ finances.\\" Lakeland Ledger, July 11, 1981.\\"Brief.\\" The Montreal Gazette, June 19, 1981.\\"Cenikor: The last stop before prison\\", by Rosalind Jackler, The Houston Post, April 29, 1984.

The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station. Location  The S-Bahn station is located in the centre of the Frankfurt district of Sindlingen in the state of Hesse. The station is located where the main street of the suburb, Sindlinger Bahnstraße, passes under the Taunus Railway (). To the north of the platform is a municipal building called the Haus Sindlingen (\\"Sindlingen House\\"), which is used as a community centre and library. It was used for a trial of members of the Red Army Faction, including Astrid Proll, in 1973–74. History In the 19th century the northern and central parts of Sindlingen were undeveloped. The rural town had just 750 inhabitants. The Taunus Railway, which was opened between Höchst and Hattersheim on 24 November 1839, ran through this area and crossed the highway to Zeilsheim (now called Sindlinger Bahnstraße, literally \\"Sindlingen railway street\\"). The progressive industrialisation of the area, in particular the growth of the factories of Hoechst AG, caused considerable population growth in Sindlingen and the surrounding villages. Eventually stations would be built in the district on the Taunus Railway and the Main-Lahn Railway, which was opened a little further north in 1877, although the northern station was not completed for more than a century. In 1893, the station was opened with the name of Sindlingen-Zeilsheim at the level crossing on Sindlinger Bahnstraße. The station building was replaced by a new one in 1968, which, however, was completely burned down on 29 February 1984 after an explosion. In 1974, the Frankfurter Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund (Frankfurt Transport and Fares Association, the predecessor of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund) introduced S-Bahn-like operations on the line, operating as line R 1; this was replaced by line S 1 in 1978. A major change came in 1980 when the level crossing was replaced by an underpass. In 2007, the long-planned Frankfurt-Zeilsheim station was opened on the Main-Lahn Railway, 500 metres further north, also on Sindlinger Bahnstraße. Design The architecture of the station is similar to the Frankfurt-Nied station. In contrast, however, the northern and southern platforms are on the opposite sides of Sindlinger Bahnstraße. Access to the platforms is via a pedestrian underpass that crosses the railway tracks parallel with and at the same level as the road underpass. In order to cross the road there are two pedestrian overbridges that run parallel on either side of the railway bridge. As well as the main entrances from Sindlinger Bahnstraße, there are additional external entrance from park and ride car parks. The platforms built after the old station building was destroyed in 1984 are very austere, but the so-called “DB-Plus” point provides waiting passengers with a shelter. Operations The only trains that stops at Frankfurt-Sindlingen station is S-Bahn line S 1 running between Rödermark-Ober Roden and Wiesbaden every 30 minutes during the day, every 15 minutes during peak hours and every 60 minutes during quite periods. Being close to the western gate of Industriepark Höchst (Höchst Industrial Park) and the Internationale Schule Frankfurt Rhein-Main, it is very busy during peak hours. The station is also served by bus route 53 towards the Bolongaro Palace and the Sindlingen cemetery and bus route 57 towards Siedlung Taunusblick.
