They all play major or medium-sized roles in one or more of the following works: Novels: * Night Watch * Day Watch * Dusk Watch aka Twilight Watch * Final Watch aka Last Watch * New Watch *Sixth Watch Stories: *\\"Face of the Dark Palmira\\" - by Vladimir Vasilyev *\\"The Other among Others\\" - by Vitaly Kaplan Movies: * Night Watch * Day Watch Computer games: * Night Watch * Day Watch Characters are categorized by their affiliation when they first appear.  Light Others  Characters with Magical abilities that have aligned themselves with the Light are called Light Others = Anton Gorodetsky = * (Light Mage) - The main character of Night Watch and the two movies, a main or major character in the rest of the stories (except Unauthorised Personnel Permitted) and the narrator of the tetralogy (sans Day Watch). A reluctant member of the Night Watch. In the beginning of the first book he prefers mundane, technical jobs to actual field work, initially supervising the Night Watch's IT department. The events of the series force him to step up and become a full-fledged operative. He eventually becomes an extremely powerful magician. Over time, he becomes considerably more cynical about the cause of Light Others. His favorite pastime is listening to custom mini-discs. In the novels, he uses the randomized playback feature of his player in much the same way a Taoist might throw stones to gain a rough idea of the future, for example an ominous song implying upcoming danger. Having discovered his powers 7 years (12 in the movies) prior to the series' beginning, he starts off as a relatively weak mage, only to discover unsuspected potential as time passes by, becoming a second level mage and then, affected by the Fuaran ritual, a mage Beyond Classification. Possesses a pistol with silver bullets for protection from vampires and werewolves. Day Watch (Movie): as he uses the Chalk of Fate to rewind time and corrects his biggest mistake, he becomes human without any powers or recollections of the Others. =Boris Ignatyevich/Gesar= * (Also spelled Geser and Gesser, also referred to as Boris Ignatyevich or Boris Ivanovich (depending on the print) in both movies) (Grand Light Mage) - an ancient mage of Tibetan descent who taught a number of heroes and philosophers during his lifetime. He moved to Europe during the early 15th century. Although he has had many opportunities to advance to high-level posts within Night Watch, he chooses to remain a Regional Director of the Moscow division (the Moscow division is the de facto head of all divisions of former USSR). Gesar is a battle-hardened tactician who's been known to turn devastating defeats into small victories. He cares a great deal about his subordinates, though he doesn't hesitate to put them in harm's way for the sake of the greater good. His mage level is Beyond Classification (i.e. doesn't fit into the 1-7 scale). Dusk Watch (Novel): During the course of the Dusk Watch, it was revealed that he and Olga had a son, who turned out to be mortal. =Svetlana Gorodetskaya (n√©e Nazarova)= * (Also called Sveta) (Grand Light Sorceress) - a young doctor who is not aware of her powers at the beginning of the novels. Night Watch (Book and Movie): She is a victim of a plot by Zavulon to either kill her or depress her until she turns to the Dark before she joins the Night Watch. Her power is discovered when Zavulon goes too far and she inadvertently curses herself; Svetlana's powers are so strong that the curse develops into an enormous vortex that threatens to unleash an Inferno and destroy Moscow. She enters into a relationship with Anton which becomes strained as Svetlana's powers continue to increase exponentially. Day Watch (Movie): She clashes with Yegor during his birthday, which starts a war between Light and Dark. Yegor attacks her with his weapon, blinding her. When Anton rewinds time and both forget what was, he meets her in a park, and shows interest in her. Twilight Watch (Novel): Svetlana and Anton eventually have a child together that is more powerful than either of them, a very rare occurrence among the others (who usually have normal, ungifted children). =Olga= * (Grand Light Sorceress) - an old friend and an occasional lover of Geser. Geser has a number of pet names for her (Olyushka, etc.) When he refers to someone whose name begins with \\"Ol\\", he is likely referring to Olga. Night Watch (Book and Movie): Olga was turned into an owl for breaking obligations she had to the Light. In the book, she was allowed to change back to her human form during wartime, for half an hour every day. In the movie, she changed back to her human form permanently after being assigned to Anton as a partner. Day Watch (Book): Thanks to Geser's manipulations, she was restored to her human form and regained her powers by the end of Night Watch. Day Watch (Movie): Geser reveals that Olga was imprisoned in an owl body by the Inquisition when she sacrificed herself to help Geser out in a difficult situation, and later Geser understood that it was the Dark Others' plan all along. =Semyon= * (Also spelled Simeon) (First-level Light Mage) - a crusty, experienced mage with a wryly cynical outlook on the world. Unlike many of his fellow mages, he is a capable fighter even without his magic. Unlike most mages, he is capable of \\"reading\\" people the same way a normal person would - by body language, as opposed to magic. In the films, he is associated with a large yellow supercharged truck to which he has an undefined connection. In the books, this connection is less distinct. However, he's still the designated driver of Night Watch parties, as he's a genius with anything that has wheels, even without his powers. In the film Day Watch, he is killed after ramming his truck through a much larger semi-truck attempting to stop him and Olga from reaching the hotel where Anton and Svetlana are stuck at a Dark Other party. They reach the hotel in the truck and he says \\"We made it\\", before slouching forward on to the car horn, supposedly dead. However, he is seen again at the end of the film, once Anton rewrites his own fate, back when he, Bear, and Tiger Cub were attempting to catch the witch at the beginning of the movie Night Watch. He speaks briefly to Anton, and tells his co-workers that Anton has become human again. =Tiger Cub/Yekaterina \\"Katya\\" Sorokina= * (Shifter-Mage) - a young, playful mage with a penchant for jewels and amulets. She is highly regarded both by Dark and Light Others. It is said that she can charm anyone. As the name implies, she shapeshifts to tiger as her preferred animal form. She has a large house riddled with secret passages and guarded by dogs trained to attack Others (normally animals are afraid of Others). She can be rather impulsive and vengeful, which gets her in trouble on several occasions. The books make the distinction that she is a mage (originally a light healer) that has developed the ability to change form through study and practice rather than the normal forced transition of a werewolf. Day Watch (Book): She was killed by a powerful Dark \\"Mirror\\" Other, who crushed her with a spell. =Bear= * (Shifter-Mage) - a reclusive, quiet mage known for his calculated, brutal tactics. His preferred animal form is a large polar bear, although he can take any bear form. Due to his shady personality, he is often referred to as an ex-Dark Other (though his supposed former affiliation to the Dark Others proved to be wrong). He is frequently partnered with Tiger Cub. Night Watch (movie): his first name is Ilya and he is romantically involved with Tiger Cub. Day Watch (book): when Tiger Cub dies, he is largely saddened by her demise, which leads other operatives to think he had a crush on her. =Ignat= * (Light Incubus) - a self-absorbed mage with \\"[the] face of a Hollywood actor and the body of a Greek god\\". He prides himself on being able to bed any woman (or man). As a result, he takes failure very hard. Night Watch (book and Russian version of the movie): He is called by Geser to attempt to seduce Svetlana, so she would relax the vortex or at least say who cursed her. However, he tries too hard and she figures him out. Day Watch (movie): his failure drove him to be downgraded to a simple archive guard. However, as seen in front of the hotel \\"Kosmos\\", he still has influence on other operatives, as he motivates them to attack before Olga stops him. =Garik= * (Light Mage) - a shy mage infamous for his bad luck with women. =Igor Teplov= * (Light Mage) - an idealistic mid-level mage. Despite his youthful appearance, he was born in the late 1920s. He is dedicated to the cause of Light Others, though his knee jerk reaction to Dark Others and refusal to compromise his principles has occasionally caused problems. Voluntarily dematerialized into the Twilight at the end of the events in the 2nd book, Day Watch. =Yulia= * (Light Mage) - a smart young girl who works at the Night Watch as an analytical sorceress. Yulia admires Tiger Cub. Geser punishes her by forcing her to live as a regular human girl of her age for a week. =Ilya= * (Light Mage) - bespectacled first-level mage who swapped bodies with Geser in Story One: Destiny to trick Zavulon. He is said to be a powerful mage. He is good friends with Semyon. Although they are both first- level magicians, Ilya is hinted to be slightly more powerful. =Nadya Gorodetskaya= * (Absolute Light Sorceress) - Dusk Watch (Novel): daughter of Anton and Svetlana. Two years old in Twilight Watch, five years old in Final Watch. Even at her young age, she's capable of feats few Light Others can match. In spite of the knowledge that comes with such power, she retains childlike innocence, which occasionally results in her using her powers without thinking of the consequences. She is a Zero-level Other - she does not emit magic, only absorb. In all the novels, there are only two Other's that had such a level: Merlin and Jesus (although he is only mentioned). Nadya was intended to be the Light Messiah, with help of Geser's manipulations with fate. However, due to Zavulon's intrigue, the only Light Other apparently able to be a teacher and mentor to a Messiah, voluntarily defleshed himself. Nadya is still going to become an incredibly powerful Light Sorceress, but it is not certain whether she will actually become Light Messiah. In New Watch, it's revealed that Nadya has the power to destroy Twilight itself and, by extension, all magic. =Foma (Thomas) Lermont= * (Grand Light Mage) - Final Watch (Novel): Once known as Thomas the Rhymer and is Mikhail Lermontov's ancestor, among other things. Head of Scottish Night Watch and friend of Geser. =Alexander \\"Las\\" Ulyanov= See below under Unaffiliated. =Alisher Ganiev= * (Light Mage) - Night Watch (novel): he comes from Uzbekistan and gives the Chalk of Fate to Geser, whom he respects for helping his father. Final Watch (Novel): he accompanies Anton to Uzbekistan to meet Rustam, even though he doesn't want to return. He reveals that his father was Geser's devona and a mentally challenged person, and that Geser helped him out by making him as smart as the others, but the spell wore off afterwards. Day Watch (Movie): he works in the Samarkand Night Watch and seems to be a friend of Anton's.  Dark Others  Characters with Magical abilities that have aligned themselves with the Dark are called Dark Others (Selfishness): =Zavulon (Zabulon) = * (Also spelled Zabulon) (Grand Dark Mage) - An ancient schemer about the same age as Geser. He runs the Day Watch in Moscow and his plans frequently involve misdirection and hidden agendas. His power seems to rival that of Geser but he is often, if not overpowered by Geser, outwitted by him. His true form has taken on demonic characteristics because he has spent a great deal of time in the Twilight. His chosen human appearance is often misleading, as he appears as a thin intellectual who does not seem to be a threat to those who do not know him. Day Watch Novel: Geser's consistent ability to outwit him eventually forces the intangible forces of the Twilight World itself to restore the balance between Light and Dark. Face of the Dark Palmira: His human name is revealed to be Arthur. The name \\"Zabulon\\" is from the Old Testament. =Alisa Donnikova= *(Also spelled Alyssa and Alicia) (Dark Witch) - A young witch with a penchant for mischief and discreet mind manipulation. Night Watch (book): She was Zavulon's lover until the end of the Night Watch novel, when she is caught attempting to steal power through illicit means. Night Watch (movie): she puts the vampire back on Yegor's track by giving her his goggles so she would \\"sniff him out like a starving dog\\". Later, she reads Daria's arrest report in front of Yegor, who, upon learning Anton tried to kill him before he was born, joins the Dark Others. Day Watch (book): The first story of the book is told from her point of view. She and Zavulon have a brief rapprochement in the first part of the Day Watch novel, but it's not clear how sincere Zavulon is. She meets Igor Teplov at a camp by the Black Sea and both believe the other is a simple human being, and they fall for each other. But as their powers come back, they realize they are on opposite sides. Igor challenges Alisa and Alisa, not even trying to fight back, is drowned. She is later temporarily revived as a witness during the trial in the last part of the book. It's strongly implied (and believed by Alisa) that Zavulon was manipulating her to remove Igor from play. Day Watch (Movie): She is forced to be Zavulon's lover after he puts a ring on her finger. The ring makes Alisa and Zavulon linked and Alisa is unable to take it off. When Kostya dies, and a massive disaster hits Moscow, she gets rid of the ring by cutting her finger off and tries to revive Kostya with the Chalk of Fate, but to no avail. =Kostya (Konstantin) Saushkin= * (Vampire) - A young, idealistic vampire whom Anton befriended before becoming an Other. Anton's actions during the first part of Night Watch drove a wedge between them. Kostya was bitten by his father after he was born, in order to prevent him from succumbing to a fatal disease (pneumonia in both lungs), and has resented being a vampire ever since. His goal is to study biology and find a cure for vampirism or at the very least find a way to make himself no different from everyone else. Dusk Watch (Novel): Normally, a vampire must drink blood, and kill (completely) about 6-7 humans to become a High Vampire. Kostya has managed to become one by only drinking the \\"Saushkin Cocktail\\" - a special mix from blood of 12 donors, willingly given. Later, thanks to the Fuaran book, he becomes the most powerful Other in the world. In the same novel, is revealed that the final objective of Kostya was to use the Fuaran on the whole world by undergoing the ritual on board the International Space Station. Anton hijacks the shuttle take off, stranding him in space without chance to open a portal to teleport away. In a subsequent novel, it's told he was burnt reentering the atmosphere and his skeleton was recovered by the Night Watch. Day Watch (Movie): he has an affair with Alisa. When the Inquisitors take Kostya's father away, Kostya tries to attack Zavulon and is killed in a tango dance. As the result of Anton's use of the Chalk of Fate, however, he is most likely alive again at the end of the film. =Edgar= * (Dark Mage) - a strong Dark mage (1-2 level) who was transferred to Moscow from an Estonian Day Watch on Zavulon's behest. Although he was, for a while, a steadfast supporter of the Dark Other's cause, he found many aspects of the Dark Others' lifestyle distasteful. Between Day Watch (Novel) and Dusk Watch (Novel): After becoming tired of being a pawn in Zavulon's schemes, he joins the Inquisition. Final Watch (Novel): After his wife is killed, Edgar is overcome with sadness and finds out about Merlin's Crown of All Things, which he believes will resurrect Others who have withdrawn into the Twilight; he then joins the Last Watch in an attempt to obtain the Crown. He is killed by Arina when he requests to be \\"helped\\" to join his wife in the Twilight at the end of the novel. =Arina= * (Witch, Grandmother of grandmothers, high other of the light, formerly high dark other.) Twilight Watch (Novel): She was involved in an experiment intended to create a perfect society, organised by both Watches together with the Inquisition, but she sabotaged it, together with an unknown Light Mage who is most likely Geser. Then she put herself to sleep for several decades, to wait out the hunt. Arina does most of her magic using plants and herbs. She chose darkness out of selfishness rather than any particular malice. She does not like to hurt people, although she will pretend she is willing to if it suits her goals. She actively dislikes and disrespects Zavulon. Final Watch (Novel): She becomes a Higher Light Other and is one of the members of Final Watch trio. New Watch (Novel): Arina becomes obsessed with prophecies and is determined to force Anton's hand to destroy Twilight itself, having decided that magic is evil. Anton strands her in the Sarcophagus of Time, but it's implied that she has a way out. Sixth Watch (Novel): The conclave of witches is incapable of choosing a new leader, Grandmother of grandmothers, because their current leader (Arina) is still alive but inaccessible to everyone so after 10 years trapped in the Sarcophagus of Time she is visited by Anton who offers her a way out on the condition that she accepts to be part of the Sixth Watch in order to save the world from peril, Arina who confesses to have already lived through the same situation in the year 1914 accepts and eventually tells Anton the whole truth behind the Two-in-one. Eventually she confesses her love for Anton but decides to sacrifice him in order to save the world. =Gennadiy Saushkin= * (renamed as Valeriy Saushkin in the movies) (Vampire) - Kostya's father. When Kostya was little, Gennadiy had to turn him into a vampire, for fear of him dying from a fatal disease, then turned his mother as well. Night Watch (book): he still lives with Kostya and his wife, Polina, a floor above Anton's apartment. Final Watch (book): after mourning the loss of his son Kostya, and that of his wife Polina (who committed suicide when she learned Kostya was dead), he became obsessed with vengeance on Anton. He drank blood from 50 people to become a Great Vampire, then joined the Final Watch. Night Watch (Movie): he is a butcher and lives alone with his son in an apartment on the same floor as Anton. Day Watch (Movie): he is taken away by the Inquisition for having broken the Truce. He however reveals that Zavulon made him do this, in exchange for cancelling Kostya's blood license.  Inquisition  The Inquisition is a policing group created by the treaty establishing d√©tente between Light and Dark. They are tasked with monitoring compliance with the treaty and meting out punishments for infractions. Members are personally either Light or Dark as above, but owe their loyalty to the Inquisition and not one or another of the Watch organizations. =Maxim= * (Inquisitor) - Night Watch (book): a middle-class Light Other whose powers emerged before Night Watch could find him. Maxim could sense evil in others around him, but was blind to good, leading him to see even people that were a mix of the two as completely evil. Because of this, he hunted and killed low-level Dark Others. Upon discovering the truth about the Others, he joined the Inquisition on the suggestion of Geser. =Witezislav= * (also spelled Vitezislav or V√≠tƒõzslav surname Hrub√≠n) (High Vampire, Inquisitor) - an old vampire who got tired of Zavulon and Day Watch and joined the Inquisition. He and Geser share a long-standing animosity for each other. According to Geser, when Vitezislav became a vampire, he killed his own mother, though it was not intended. In Twilight Watch, he discovers the Fuaran hidden by Arina and tests it on Kostya, who becomes a Higher Vampire and kills Witezislav to get hold of the book for himself. =Edgar= * See under Dark Others just above. Dusk Watch: While Maxim divorced his wife when he joined the Inquisition, Edgar married a witch. =Unnamed Inquisitor twins= * (only seen in the movies) (Inquisitors) - Night Watch (movie): when Geser and Zavulon forge the Truce, a young man is standing in the middle. While Geser and Zavulon speak, the young man's face changes as he grows older, becoming the first Inquisitor. Day Watch (movie): Two men identical to the first Inquisitor are featured in the movie (it can be only speculated if the first Inquisitor is one of them, if he was somehow divided in two, or if all Others who join the Inquisition take that form). They are old, both leaning on a walking stick, calm, serious and seemingly emotionless. They seem linked, as one of them can finish the other one's sentences. They show very developed powers when one of them throws an eavesdropping Anatoliy across the corridor with a mere look.  Unaffiliated  =Yegor (Egor)= * (spelled Egor in the Andrew Bromfield English translation) - a shy, seemingly ordinary young boy. Night Watch (Book and Movie): He was ambushed by a pair of renegade vampires in the beginning of Night Watch and is rescued by Anton. However, Anton has to save him again as the female vampire is back on his track. Night Watch (Book): Yegor is a very rare case, having a 'clean slate'. His aura shows his fate to be undetermined. In the second part of Night Watch, it is revealed that Yegor is destined to join the side of the Dark. However, at the very end of the novel his destiny is partially re-written and he remains unaffiliated. His potential mage level is very low (6 or 7). Day Watch (Novel): he is briefly seen on a subway train by the Mirror Vitaliy Rogoza, when the latter is on his way to an Inquisition tribunal. Final Watch (Novel): he meets with Anton on the way to Edinburgh and once again when there. It is revealed that an unaffiliated mage is a potential Mirror (just like Vitaly Ragoza) and Anton fears Yegor could become one. Night Watch (Movie): Being Anton's son in the movie, Yegor willingly joins the Dark Others, as Anton admits he wanted to kill him as an unborn child because he believed he wasn't his son and an obstacle from getting his wife back. Day Watch (Movie): He became very powerful (a match for Svetlana) and there is much concern that if and when the two begin to fight, Moscow will be destroyed. However, when this happens and Anton uses the Chalk of Fate to turn time back to 1992, he chooses not to kill Yegor, and the latter's future remains undetermined. =Vitaliy Ragoza= * (Spelled Vitaly Rogoza in the American Edition and in the original Russian edition) (The Mirror) - Day Watch (novel): a minor Other from Mykolaiv, Ukraine, who was not associated with either side, but was turned into the Mirror by the Gloom itself in order to correct the imbalance between the Night Watch and Day Watch in Moscow. As the Mirror, he had an ability to match the power level of any Other he was combating at the time. In the span of two weeks, he killed Tiger Cub and drained Svetlana's power. It was stated at the end of his story that he had become the most powerful other on Earth. He only possessed this level of power for a few minutes after completing his mission, at which point he was absorbed into the twilight/gloom. Vitaliy realized that, in restoring the balance between the light and the dark, he had attained a level of power so great as to be a threat to that balance. In a later novel Final Watch, it is stated that a low-level neutral Other is required to become a Mirror. He was the narrator of the second story of Day Watch. =Rustam= * (Grand Light Mage) - Final Watch: Rustam is an ancient mage, a contemporary of Merlin, with whom he was friends. He was also a close friend of Gesar once, but they fell out later. Rustam finally became a recluse, after he lost interest in the world. He moved permanently to the Gloom (but he did not disperse in it), visiting the reality only occasionally - for those purposes he borrows the body of Afandi, a relatively low-level old Other he once initiated. Rustam lives close to the Plane of Demons, a place where once he and Geser fought a war against Dark Others and used a spell so terrible that no one ever dared to use it since. That spell caused disruption in all levels of the Gloom, causing the opposing mages not to vanish into the Gloom, but to turn to stone in the real world, remaining alive but immobile and without any senses. They were released from their prison by Anton Gorodetsky, thanks to the power of the Crown of All. =Merlin= * Final Watch (novel): one of the few zero-level mages who ever lived. He left many artifacts and spells, including the one Gesar and Rustam used on the Plain of Demons. He was the only Other who changed his affiliation (going from Light to Dark), until Arina. Apart from other artifacts and spells, he left behind the Crown Of All Things, a deep seated philosophy in which all the levels of Twilight were connected via a grandiose loop, or \\"crown\\", hidden in the deepest level of the Twilight, and protected by carefully set obstacles and guardians. =Alexander \\"Las\\" Ulyanov= * Dusk Watch (novel): Normal human heavy metal bass player that Anton encounters while undercover in Dusk Watch. Anton's apartment has no toilet, Las's has no shower. As he has always been attracted to the strange and fantastic (and probably familiar with hallucinogens), he is unfazed by seeing magic used around him. He is eventually given powers by Kostya as a demonstration and joins the Night Watch. This character is based on a real Russian musician, Alexander \\"Las\\" Ulyanov. =Zoar= * Day Watch (Movie): besides the Inquisitor twins, he is the only key character present in a Watch movie, but absent from the pentalogy. Back to Tamerlane's age, he was the keeper of the Chalk of Fate in an impenetrable fortress in North Iran, until Tamerlane found the Chalk, and Zoar didn't oppose him owning it. Zoar even became Tamerlane's right-hand man. When Tamerlane died, he was buried in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, and Zoar remained there as a member of the government. He saw Olga during one of expeditions and warned her that if Tamerlane's tomb is opened, a war would start, but was disobeyed. Prior to the events of the movie, he moved to Moscow and started a restaurant, keeping a low profile and using the Chalk to write prices on a blackboard. When Anton discovers Zoar has the Chalk, Zoar gladly gives it to him. He seems to personally know Geser.

Two rondels covering the vulnerable underarm section of a suit of armour A rondel () is a circular piece of metal used for protection, as part of a harness of plate armour, or attached to a helmet, breastplate, couter or on a gauntlet. Rondels most commonly hang off breastplates and cover the armpit, which is a vulnerable point. They may also have been used to steady the jousting lance. In this instance they are commonly known as besagews. They also appear on the back of a type of late medieval helmet known as the armet. Their purpose for this is unknown, though it has been surmised that they may protect strapping, or just be some sort of added protection. Rondels also appear uncommonly on the metacarpal parts of some historical gauntlet designs, and appear in some period illustrations protecting the side of the head, and the point of the elbow (where a fan may normally be).

A third department, the Police judiciaire, is the criminal investigation division of the National Police but has become increasingly independent and is widely considered a separate branch in its own right. The size of the National Police has generally remained consistent at between 1,000 and 2,000 personnel for several decades since the collapse of the Central African Empire. In 2009 there were 1,350 police officers in the country. Organisations The Central African Republic has, in effect, two national police agencies patterned after the French law enforcement system: a civil police and a gendarmerie. =National Police= Toyota pick-up of the National Police in Bangui, April 2018. The National Police, formally known as the S√ªret√© Nationale, is a uniformed police component based in Bangui and charged with enforcing civil public safety laws throughout major urban districts. As its title suggests, the National Police is organised on the national, rather than the local, level and operates under the control of a central Direction des Services de S√ªret√© Nationale. Due to limited resources and manpower constraints, the police has been largely restricted to Bangui itself; outside the capital city its influence is mostly nominal. The outbreak of civil war in 2012 also frustrated the ability of the police to enforce the law in outlying settlements being threatened by heavily armed militias. Poor discipline and the frequent delay of salary payments has led to increased corruption within the National Police. According to the United Nations, the force has a low public approval rating due to well-publicized acts of corruption and its perceived inability to carry out its mandate, especially in the northeastern part of the country. The National Police was founded in 1963, shortly after the Central African Republic's independence from France, with a strength of 315 personnel. As crimes involving firearms were rare in the country at the time, the police were issued few weapons and mostly operated unarmed. The force declined greatly owing to rampant nepotism under the Central African Empire and some subsequent governments. In 2003, the National Police consisted of nine specialised divisions responsible for border control, administrative affairs, police training, anti-drug trafficking efforts, logistics and human resources, national security, criminal investigations, public safety, and urban counter- terrorism. Reports of widespread violence and looting carried out by heavily armed militants in recent years have led to the formation of a tenth division specifically for countering banditry. This was the first civil police unit trained and equipped to paramilitary standards in the Central African Republic's history, as well as the only one allowed to reissue any weapons it confiscated. Aside from the anti-banditry component, few of the other police divisions carried firearms in 2003, reflecting the longstanding trend since independence for an unarmed, largely non-militarised force. =Gendarmerie= The Central African Gendarmerie is a military component charged with maintaining internal security throughout all rural districts outside major settlements and towns. It functions as the sole agency responsible for law enforcement in the Central African Republic's least developed regions and has operated both independently and under the auspices of the Central African Armed Forces throughout the country's history. The Gendarmerie is headed by a Director-General and consists of four battalions and three specialist commands. It is unusual in that it has a division responsible for investigating white collar crimes, which is normally a task assigned to civil police in most other countries. The size of the Gendarmerie has generally corresponded to the size of the National Police, fluctuating between 1,000 and 2,000 personnel. Between 1994 and 2002, the Gendarmerie declined in importance and did not recruit or train any new personnel. In addition, most of its armouries were plundered by mutinous soldiers in 2002, leaving it critically short of equipment. While a number of weapons were later brought out of reserve to compensate for the shortage of firearms and ammunition, most were old and either obsolete or approaching obsolescence. Following the outbreak of civil war in 2012, the Gendarmerie was retrained and reorganised by the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA), with financial support from both the European Union and the African Union. Security agencies According to French military archives, in 1963 the French government helped the Central African Republic organise three other state- sponsored security units besides the National Police and the Gendarmerie. These consisted of forest rangers, \\"hunting guards\\", and a security contingent for maintaining order and policing near diamond mines. The two former examples apparently ceased to exist between the mid-1980s and 2000, as the government did not express interest in hiring or training new personnel for these occupations. The concept of hiring guards to protect the country's natural resources was revived again in 2000.

Both participated in numerous actions during the Russo-Japanese War and in World War I. Background The Niitaka class was the second cruiser class built to a completely Japanese design and was ordered as part of the 2nd Emergency Fleet Replenishment Program, with a budget acquired by the indemnity awarded to Japan by the Treaty of Shimonoseki ending the First Sino-Japanese War. These small cruisers were intended for high speed reconnaissance. The lead ship Niitaka was built at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, which already had considerable experiencing in building small cruisers. Its sister ship, Tsushima, was built at the new Kure Naval Arsenal, at Kure, Hiroshima and took considerably longer to complete. Design As depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1902 In terms of design, the Niitaka class was very conservative in layout and similar to, but somewhat larger and the earlier Japanese-designed . The increased displacement, heavier armor and lower center of gravity resulted in a more seaworthy and powerful vessel than Suma, and enabled Tsushima to outclass many other contemporary protected cruisers.Chesneau, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1860‚Äì1905, page 230 In terms of armament, the Niitaka-class cruisers were not equipped with torpedoes. Observing problems experienced by the United States Navy during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War with torpedo reliability and the dangers of sympathetic detonation, it was decided not to use this weapon on the new cruisers. The main battery was standardized to the QF 6 inch /40 naval gun used on most contemporary Japanese cruisers. The Niitaka-class cruisers were fitted with 16 Niclausse boilers, a great improvement on the locomotive boilers of Suma. Ships in class Two Niitaka-class cruisers were built. Both were lost before the start of World War II. ; Ordered in 1897, launched 15 November 1902, and completed 27 January 1904, Niitaka played a major role in the Russo- Japanese War. During World War I, Niitaka participated at the Battle of Tsingtao and was subsequently assigned to patrol of shipping lanes in Southeast Asia, and in the Indian Ocean from its base at Cape Town. After the war, the ship served during Japan's Siberian Intervention. The cruiser was lost after running aground in a typhoon on 26 August 1923 on the coast of Kamchatka. Tsushima ; Ordered in 1897, launched 15 December 1902, and completed 14 February 1904, Tsushima participated in the closing stages of the Russo-Japanese War. In World War I, Tsushima played an active role in the Battle of Tsingtao and pursuit of the German East Asia Squadron. The ship was subsequently assigned to Cape Town, where the cruiser assisted its sister ship Niitaka in patrol of shipping lanes in the Indian Ocean. The ship subsequently was used in the Siberian Intervention. Tsushima was struck from the navy list in 1936 and expended as a torpedo target in 1944.

The competition was marred by the Munich air disaster on 6 February 1958, when an aircraft carrying the Manchester United football team home from a European Cup match in Belgrade crashed at the Munich-Riem airport on take-off. Eight players and fifteen other people, including an array of senior coaches, officials and sports journalists were killed and another nineteen seriously injured. Three of the dead, Roger Byrne, Tommy Taylor and Duncan Edwards were experienced England team members while Jackie Blanchflower, an Ireland international, was left permanently disabled. Several other international footballers were also injured more or less severely. This tragedy rather subdued the tournament culmination two months later, although the England team did secure a cathartic 4‚Äì0 victory in Glasgow over the Scots with one of the goals coming from Bobby Charlton, who had been injured in the Munich crash. The tournament itself was shared by England and Ireland after weak performances by Scotland and Wales in their games. While Scotland and Ireland played out a 1‚Äì1 draw in their opener, England began well, beating the Welsh 4‚Äì0 in Cardiff. The second round of matches however changed the tournament's direction as Ireland beat England in London in a surprising overturn of form. The match was very close, the Irish only winning 3‚Äì2, one of the English goals coming from Duncan Edwards. Scotland and Wales meanwhile were both unable to take advantage of England's discomfort, drawing 1‚Äì1. Before the final matches, the season was permanently disfigured by the Munich disaster. Wales and Ireland again struggled to a 1‚Äì1 draw, denying the Irish a rare undisputed title while England, with a team containing several young and inexperienced players, achieved an impressive 4‚Äì0 victory over the Scots in Glasgow to take their share of the tournament. The competition was also intended to have been a good indicator of form going into the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden, which all four Home Nations had reached through separate qualifying groups. The disaster however made the tournament a poor indicator and so it proved, England and Scotland unable to progress from the group stage, England still suffering from the loss of so many key players. Wales and Northern Ireland progressed from their groups in impressive form but were unable to sustain their momentum, Wales going down to a Pel√© goal in a hard fought match to eventual winners Brazil, while the Irish lost 4‚Äì0 in the Quarter-Final to the France of Just Fontaine.

They play an important role in the duality theories of these groups. The Fourier‚ÄìStieltjes algebra and the Fourier‚ÄìStieltjes transform on the Fourier algebra of a locally compact group were introduced by Pierre Eymard in 1964. Definition =Informal= Let G be a locally compact abelian group, and ƒú the dual group of G. Then L_1(\\\\hat{\\\\mathit{G}}) is the space of all functions on ƒú which are integrable with respect to the Haar measure on ƒú, and it has a Banach algebra structure where the product of two functions is convolution. We define A(G) to be the set of Fourier transforms of functions in L_1(\\\\hat{\\\\mathit{G}}) , and it is a closed sub- algebra of CB(G) , the space of bounded continuous complex-valued functions on G with pointwise multiplication. We call A(G) the Fourier algebra of G. Similarly, we write M(\\\\hat{\\\\mathit{G}}) for the measure algebra on ƒú, meaning the space of all finite regular Borel measures on ƒú. We define B(G) to be the set of Fourier-Stieltjes transforms of measures in M(\\\\hat{\\\\mathit{G}}) . It is a closed sub-algebra of CB(G) , the space of bounded continuous complex-valued functions on G with pointwise multiplication. We call B(G) the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra of G. Equivalently, B(G) can be defined as the linear span of the set P(G) of continuous positive-definite functions on G. Since L_1(\\\\hat{\\\\mathit{G}}) is naturally included in M(\\\\hat{\\\\mathit{G}}) , and since the Fourier-Stieltjes transform of an L_1(\\\\hat{\\\\mathit{G}}) function is just the Fourier transform of that function, we have that A(G) \\\\subset B(G) . In fact, A(G) is a closed ideal in B(G) . =Formal= Let B(\\\\mathit{G}) be a Fourier‚ÄìStieltjes algebra and A(\\\\mathit{G}) be a Fourier algebra such that the locally compact group \\\\mathit{G} is abelian. Let M(\\\\widehat{\\\\mathit{G}}) be the measure algebra of finite measures on \\\\widehat{G} and let L_1(\\\\widehat{\\\\mathit{G}}) be the convolution algebra of integrable functions on \\\\widehat{G} , where \\\\widehat{\\\\mathit{G}} is the character group of the Abelian group \\\\mathit{G} . The Fourier‚ÄìStieltjes transform of a finite measure \\\\mu on \\\\widehat{\\\\mathit{G}} is the function \\\\widehat{\\\\mu} on \\\\mathit{G} defined by : \\\\widehat{\\\\mu}(x) = \\\\int_{\\\\widehat{G}} \\\\overline{X(x)} \\\\, d \\\\mu(X), \\\\quad x \\\\in G The space B(\\\\mathit{G}) of these functions is an algebra under pointwise multiplication is isomorphic to the measure algebra M(\\\\widehat{\\\\mathit{G}}) . Restricted to L_1(\\\\widehat{\\\\mathit{G}}) , viewed as a subspace of M(\\\\widehat{\\\\mathit{G}}) , the Fourier‚ÄìStieltjes transform is the Fourier transform on L_1(\\\\widehat{\\\\mathit{G}}) and its image is, by definition, the Fourier algebra A(\\\\mathit{G}) . The generalized Bochner theorem states that a measurable function on \\\\mathit{G} is equal, almost everywhere, to the Fourier‚ÄìStieltjes transform of a non-negative finite measure on \\\\widehat{G} if and only if it is positive definite. Thus, B(\\\\mathit{G}) can be defined as the linear span of the set of continuous positive-definite functions on \\\\mathit{G} . This definition is still valid when \\\\mathit{G} is not Abelian. =Helson‚ÄìKahane‚ÄìKatznelson‚ÄìRudin theorem= Let A(G) be the Fourier algebra of a compact group G. Building upon the work of Wiener, L√©vy, Gelfand, and Beurling, in 1959 Helson, Kahane, Katznelson, and Rudin proved that, when G is compact and abelian, a function f defined on a closed convex subset of the plane operates in A(G) if and only if f is real analytic. In 1969 Dunkl proved the result holds when G is compact and contains an infinite abelian subgroup. References * \\"Functions that Operate in the Fourier Algebra of a Compact Group\\" Charles F.

Written by drummer Bill Stevenson, the song describes an ex-girlfriend with whom he had a tumultuous romance. The B-side track \\"Crazy?\\", written by bassist Karl Alvarez, is from the Allroy's Revenge recording sessions but was not included on the album.  Background  Drummer Bill Stevenson wrote \\"She's My Ex\\" about a difficult relationship. Several of Stevenson's songs on Allroy's Revenge describe a tumultuous romance, including \\"Scary Sad\\", \\"She's My Ex\\", and \\"Net\\". The songs were written about an ex-girlfriend of Stevenson's who had problems with drugs and was placed on probation. \\"She's My Ex\\" describes how he \\"can't expect she'll change her ways, can't accept the things she done / She's just my ex / Nothing more, nothing less / She'll always be my ex\\". Recording engineer Richard Andrews remarked that \\"It seems like on every album, Bill would have the song that he knew was gonna bring people to the band and bring people to the record, and 'She's My Ex' was one of them.\\" \\"She's My Ex\\" was recorded with the rest of Allroy's Revenge in December 1988 at Third Wave Recording in Torrance, California, with Stevenson as record producer. It was singer Scott Reynolds' first recording session with All, and recording \\"She's My Ex\\" taught him how meticulous Stevenson could be during the recording process. \\"That was where Scott got his first taste of how absolutely particular Bill was\\", remembered guitarist Stephen Egerton. Reynolds later recalled: > I've never been in a band where phrasing was so fucking important as this > band. Karl would do some of that too. Not as bad as Bill. Oh god, Bill, he'd > just stop the tape, and it's terrible because you're going \\"She'll always > be...\\" and then all of a sudden the tape stops, and you're like \\"What?\\" and > he's like \\"You‚Äôre flat\\", and he goes back. So we got all done with this > thing after days on one song, and he goes \\"That‚Äôs awesome. We're done\\", and > I'm like \\"Phew!\\" and he goes \\"Okay, let's double it.\\" \\"Crazy?\\", written by Alvarez, was also recorded during the Allroy's Revenge sessions but was left off of the album. Several performers sang backing vocals on the track, including Milo Aukerman of All's precursor band the Descendents. \\"She's My Ex\\" was released through Cruz Records in 1989 as a 10-inch and 12-inch single, cassette single, and CD single. Ilisa Katz provided the cover photograph, while Alvarez and Reynolds drew the illustrations for the back cover. Live recordings of \\"She's My Ex\\" were later released on All's live albums Trailblazer (1990) and Live Plus One (2001), the latter sung by Reynolds' successor Chad Price. The studio versions of \\"She's My Ex\\" and \\"Crazy?\\" were later remixed by Stevenson, Egerton, and Jason Livermore for All's best-of compilation album All (1999).

Law enforcement in Ethiopia is dealt with by the Ethiopian Federal Police at federal level and by regional police commissions in the Regions of Ethiopia. The Ethiopian Federal Police (EFP) was established in 1995 to serve the public, to ensure the observation of human and democratic rights and to maintain the safety and welfare of the public. Its stated duties are the enforcement of laws and safeguarding constitutional guarantees, the prevention, detection and investigation of crime, the coordination of national state police commissions and development of national policing standards. The EFP also has to provide operational support to regional police commissions. However, local militias also provide local security largely independent of the police and the Ethiopian military. Corruption is a perennial problem, particularly among traffic police who solicited bribes.\\"2008 Human Rights Reports: Ethiopia\\", Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, US State Department (accessed 8 July 2009) The U.S. Department of State states that its contacts within the Ethiopian government report that the findings of investigations into abuses by local security forces, such as arbitrary detentions and beatings of civilians, are rarely made public. However, the Ethiopian government continued its efforts to train police and army recruits in human rights. During 2008 the government is seeking assistance from the International Committee of the Red Cross, the local non-governmental organization Prison Fellowship Ethiopia (JFA-PFE), and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission to improve and professionalize its human rights training and curriculum. The JFA-PFE provided human rights training for police commissioners and members of the militia in 2008.  History  In traditional Ethiopian society, customary procedures resolved conflicts. One example of these customary procedures was the tradition of parties in civil, and even minor criminal disputes, to call upon a passing stranger to decide the issue. As Margary Perham notes, \\"These informal roadside courts might last for hours to the deep interest of the spectators, and many travellers have described this characteristic Ethiopian scene.\\"Perham, The Government of Ethiopia, second edition (London: Faber and Faber, 1969), pp. 143f Families usually avenged wrongs committed against their members, and the armed retainers of the nobility enforced law in the countryside according to the will of their leaders. In 1916 the imperial government formed a civilian municipal guard in Addis Ababa to ensure obedience to legal proclamations. The general public despised the municipal guard, nearly all of whose members were inefficient at preserving public order or investigating criminal activities.\\"Public Order and Internal Security: The National Police\\", Library of Congress Country Studies: Ethiopia (data from 1991; accessed 26 April 2011) As part of his efforts to modernize the country, Emperor Haile Selassie undertook several reforms to improve law enforcement. The first was the drafting of a criminal code in 1930, but was not distributed until 1932.Perham, Government of Ethiopia, p. 140 This was followed in 1935 by the establishment of formal, British-trained police forces in Addis Ababa and four other cities. This replaced a police force of about 3,000 men who operated in and around Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, and along the route of the railway, and had been reorganized by Belgian advisors.Perham, Government of Ethiopia, p. 196f These promising beginnings were snuffed out with Ethiopia's defeat in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. After his restoration to power in 1945, the emperor promulgated the founding of the Imperial Ethiopian Police in Proclamation 4/1942.Perham, Government of Ethiopia, p. 156 This was organized under British tutelage as a centralized national force with paramilitary and constabulary units. Then in 1946 the authorities opened the Ethiopian Police College at Sendafa. Further developments was the promulgation of a new penal code, written by the jurist J. Graven of Switzerland in 1957, which was part of a series of legal codifications which included the promulgation of a criminal procedure code in 1961, written by jurist Sir C. Matthew of the United Kingdom.Perham, Government of Ethiopia, second edition, p. 415 In 1956 the imperial government amalgamated the separate city police forces with the national police force. Initially administered as a department of the Ministry of Interior, the national police had evolved, by the early 1970s, into an independent agency commanded by a police commissioner responsible to the emperor. Local control over police was minimal, despite imperial proclamations that granted police authority to governors general of the provinces. Assistant police commissioners in each of the fourteen provinces worked in conjunction with the governors general, but for the most part Addis Ababa directed administration. The Territorial Army's provincial units, commanded by the governor general and consisting of an unpaid civilian auxiliary, assisted the national police force in areas where police were scarce. Police posts were found in all cities and larger towns and at strategic points along the main roads in the countryside. The police usually recruited local men who were familiar with the social values of the areas in which they served; however, the populace rarely looked upon such individuals with affection. Police operations generally emphasized punishment rather than prevention. By 1974 the national police numbered approximately 28,000 in all branches, including 6,000 in the Mobile Emergency Police Force, 1,200 frontier guards, and a 3,200-member commando unit with rapid reaction capability. The Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) supplied the paramilitary police with weapons and vehicles and installed a nationwide teleprinter system, while Israeli counterinsurgency specialists trained commandos and frontier guards. About 5,000 constabulary police, mostly recruited locally, served in Eritrea, as did 2,500 commandos. After the 1974 Ethiopian revolution, the Derg severely circumscribed the authority of the national police, which had been identified with the old regime and regional interests. The authorities accused constables of protecting landowners against peasants in the countryside, of arresting supporters of the military regime in Addis Ababa, and of being members of the \\"rightist opposition.\\" In Eritrea, however, the army already had taken over police functions in January 1975 from local police units suspected of being sympathetic to the secessionists. The Asmera police voluntarily stayed at their posts for some time after their dismissal to protect civilians from attack by unruly soldiers. In 1977 the national police were re-organized, and a politically reliable commissioner put in command. A security committee formulated policy, which then was implemented by the Ministry of Interior. The army assumed a larger role in criminal investigation and in maintaining public order. People's Protection Brigades took over local law enforcement duties previously assigned to the constabulary. As a result of these changes, by 1982 the strength of the national police had declined to about 17,000. Mengistu also created the army's new Eighth Division from police commando units. Other special units joined the augmented 9,000-member paramilitary Mobile Emergency Police Force for employment in counterinsurgency operations. The Directorate of Police, which reported to the commissioner, included the special Criminal Investigation Branch, which had the role in directing police counterinsurgency activities through regional branch offices. Another branch of the directorate investigated economic crimes, particularly smuggling and other forms of illicit commerce. The Revolutionary Operations Coordinating Committee, organized at the subregion level, cooperated with the police in battling smuggling and economic sabotage. The Marxist regime stressed that the mission of the national police was essentially political‚Äîmore involved with suppressing political dissent as the local law enforcement role shifted to People's Protection Brigades. Mengistu described the police mission as contributing to the \\"intensification of the class struggle\\". The government adopted a policy whereby police constables were recruited at an early age and trained in their native regions. Training was designed to allow police stationed in remote areas to be self-sufficient in building and maintaining their posts. Training standards were not uniform, and, unless it took place in Addis Ababa, in-service or specialized training was limited. In politically stable rural areas where duty requirements and supervision were less exacting, the police were less efficient than their urban counterparts. A high percentage of rural constables could neither read nor write and therefore did not keep records of their activities. Many crimes were considered to be matters concerning only the persons involved and were often ignored by the police unless one of the interested parties filed a complaint. The Addis Ababa police, by contrast, were organized into uniformed, detective, and traffic units; a riot squad, or \\"flying column\\"; and a police laboratory‚Äîorganizational refinements not found in regional police units. A small number of women served in police units in large cities. Generally, they were employed in administrative positions or as guards for female prisoners. National police officers were paid according to the same standardized wage scale that applied to members of the armed forces. As a rule, police in constabulary units were armed only with batons. Small arms usually were kept in designated armouries and were issued for specific duties. Mat√©riel used by paramilitary units included heavy machine guns, submachine guns, automatic rifles, side arms, mortars, grenades, tear gas, light armoured vehicles, and other equipment adaptable to riot control and counterinsurgency operations. Larger police units, such as the one in Addis Ababa, were also equipped with modern military vehicles, which were used as patrol cars and police vans. In many rural areas, however, horses and mules were often the sole means of transportation for constables. In January 1992, a \\"Charter of National and Regional States\\" proclamation No. 7/1992 was issued. Under this proclamation, the national and regional states were vested with the power of establishing their own police forces. Ethiopian Federal Police The Ethiopian Federal Police (EPF) was established as a federal organ having its own legal personality tasked to maintain law and order at federal level, as well as to deal with riot control. Since a reorganization in October 2000, the responsibility of the federal police has been transferred to the Federal Police Commission, which oversees the EPF. The Commission reports to the Ministry of peace following the politically motivated reform of 2018, which in turn is responsible to the parliament; however, this subordination is loose in practice. In previous years, the police reported to the Security, Immigration, and Refugees Affairs Authority, a unit of the Ethiopian Ministry of Justice.\\"Ethiopia: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\\", Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, US State Department (accessed 9 July 2009) Within the EPF, the Special Force is tasked with the duty of keeping peace and security during riots, violence and demonstrations. At the supreme level, the Federal Police Commissioner is assisted by the Council of Commissioners and directly controls three services and two offices: the Legal Service, the Ethics and Anti Corruption Services, the Public Relation Services, the Office of Commissioner and the Addis Ababa, Diredawa & Regional coordination office. The Deputy Commissioner depends on the Federal Police Commissioner and handles the main operational Main Departments: Crime Forensic investigation, Crime Prevention and Support Service Main Departments. The Deputy Commissioner also commands the Ethics police college, the Human Resources and Administration and the Research and Planning departments. = Riot control = The Ethiopian Federal Police is in charge of riot control. This activity is dealt with by the Riot Control Department, which is part of the Crime Prevention Main Department. The Riot Control Department, in turn, is subdivided into 5 Riot Divisions (the operational arm), and into three auxiliary Divisions: Support Division, Information and Intelligence Division and Training and Appointment Division. Each Riot Division has three battalions with each battalion having about 400 men. Battalions are further subdivided into Platoons and both layers have their own equipment. The total Riot Police strength is approximately 6000. = Rank structure = During Emperor Haile Selassie and Dergue regimes, there were mainly three levels. At present, the hierarchical structure is almost the same except for the difference in title designation. The lower level ranges from constable to chief sergeant, the medium level from deputy inspector to inspector, and the top level from chief inspector to commissioner (Federal Police Regulation No. 86/2003). According to the Ethiopian Federal Police Commission Establishment Proclamation No. 720/2011, the ranks of police officers are the following from lowest to highest: # Constable; # Assistant Sergeant; # Deputy Sergeant; # Sergeant; # Chief Sergeant; # Assistant Inspector; # Deputy Inspector; # Inspector; # Chief Inspector; # Deputy Commander; # Commander; # Assistant Commissioner; # Deputy Commissioner; # Commissioner; # Deputy Commissioner General; # Commissioner General Prisons As of 2015, Ethiopia's prison system consists of six federal prisons, 120 local prisons, and many unofficial detention centers. Prison and pretrial detention center conditions remained harsh and in some cases life-threatening. Severe overcrowding was a problem. In October 2008 it was reported that there were 52,000 persons in prison. Earlier that year, prison populations decreased by 10,000 due to pardons but reportedly again increased due to increases in ethnic conflict and economic crimes. Prison conditions have been reported as unsanitary and there was no budget for prison maintenance. Medical care was unreliable in federal prisons and almost nonexistent in regional prisons. The daily meal budget was approximately 9 birr (US 43 cents) per prisoner, and many prisoners supplemented this with daily food deliveries from their family or by purchasing food from local vendors. Prisoners often had less than of sleeping space in a room that could contain up to 200 persons; sleeping in rotations was not uncommon in regional prisons. Kaliti Prison is a federal prison on the southern outskirts of Addis Ababa.

He was elected Governor in a historical landslide victory in December 2012,Japan Times Inose wins landslide victory in Tokyo December 18, 2012 but announced his resignation on December 19, 2013, following a political funds-related scandal; his resignation was approved and became effective December 24, 2013.  Early life  Inose was born in Nagano Prefecture; his father died of angina when Inose was three years old. He attended elementary and junior high schools affiliated with Shinshu University, and ultimately enrolled at Shinshu in 1966. He graduated from Shinshu University in 1970 and moved to Tokyo, where he was married later in the year. He enrolled in graduate school for political science at Meiji University in 1972, and had two children, born in 1974 and 1978.  Career as author  Inose's 1983 book describes the findings of the . During the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, the Institute would be accused of being part of Japan's militaristic machine, but Inose asserts that it was little more than a think-tank, of which the purpose was to examine dispassionately the consequences of a total war. Its conclusion was that \\"there [would] be no way for Japan to win the war because of its clear material inferiority. The war [would] be drawn out. The Soviet Union [would] butt in, and Japan [would] be defeated. Therefore, going to war with the United States must absolutely be avoided.\\" This book was followed in 1987 by , concerning the development of the image of the Emperor, and the biographies of Yukio Mishima, Osamu Dazai and Kikuchi Kan: Persona (Perusona, 1995), Picaresque (Pikaresuku, 2000), and . In 2009, his 1993 book was published in English. In 2012, Inose's 1995 biography of Mishima was published in English under the title Persona: A Biography of Yukio Mishima, edited and adapted by Hiroaki Sato and published by Stone Bridge Press.Revealing the many masks of Mishima Inose's examination of public affairs led him to bitter criticisms of Japan's ruling classes and their reluctance to enact reform. His longstanding proposal was for the privatisation of the four public highway corporations, and reform of the postal savings system that finances them.Jeremy Warner. \\"Outlook: Japan's challenge; change in a country that's immune to it.\\" The Independent. 31 Dec 2003. As a result, he joined Prime Minister Junichir≈ç Koizumi's taskforce and served on the commission to examine the Japan Highway Public Corporation (Nihon Doro Kodan).\\"New politics, old politicians.\\" The Economist. 6 Oct 2005. His insistence that cuts be made was so uncompromising that some other appointees declined positions on the board.Hiroaki Sato. \\"Foreseeing the future -- and ignoring it.\\" Japan Times. 26 Jan 2004. Inose said that Japan lost World War II because the government at the time ignored data suggesting Japan would be unable to defeat the Allies and forbade access to the information before Tokyo declared war in 1941. He has further argued that this action is being repeated today by bureaucrats with respect to the economy.\\"Follow the truth and not bureaucrats: Inose.\\" Japan Times. 20 July 2002. He advocated that people share accurate information with respect to Japan's economic situation, that is not necessarily issued by bureaucrats, in efforts to help a debt-ridden Japan. He claims that \\"any reform can be implemented if people share more accurate and objective data than that (initially) released by authorities.\\"  Political career  On 15 June 2007, Governor of Tokyo Metropolitan Government Shintaro Ishihara announced that Inose had agreed to serve as a vice governor for the capital stating that \\"our opinions might differ but I believe it is healthy for us to debate and discuss many of our differences.\\"Jun Hongo. \\"Author Inose agrees to become Ishihara's deputy\\" Japan Times. 16 June 2007. Inose was initially at odds with LDP lawmakers in the metropolitan assembly during confirmation hearings, and shortly thereafter overturned an LDP-sponsored urban redevelopment initiative, although Ishihara later pressured Inose to cooperate with the LDP lawmakers. (quoting the Japanese magazine Sentaku) Upon his resignation in 2012, Governor Ishihara designated Inose as his interim successor; Inose was elected as governor of Tokyo in the 2012 Tokyo gubernatorial election with the largest number of votes in Tokyo history. His platform included reform of the Tokyo Electric Power Company and the merger of Tokyo Metro with the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation subway network, although he made minimal progress with either issue following his election. = Role in Olympic bid = As governor, Inose served as the Chairman of Tokyo's successful bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics. He attended the 2012 Summer Olympics in London in order to launch Tokyo's campaign for the Games. He created controversy in April 2013 when he made a comment that was seen as a criticism of Istanbul and their bid for the 2020 Olympics: \\"Well, compare the two countries where they have yet to build infrastructure, very sophisticated facilities. So from time to time, like Brazil, I think it‚Äôs good to have a venue for the first time. But Islamic countries, the only thing they share in common is Allah and they are fighting with each other and they have classes.\\" In Promoting His City for 2020 Games, Tokyo‚Äôs Bid Chairman Tweaks Others Criticizing rival bids is forbidden under IOC rules; following Inose's statement, Tokyo 2020 made a statement saying that they \\"have the utmost respect for all candidate cities and have always taken pride in bidding in a spirit based on the Olympic values of excellence, respect and friendship.‚Äù Tokyo 2020 organizers say they ‚Äòrespect‚Äô IOC bid rules after governor‚Äôs remarks on Istanbul Inose apologized for his comments a few days later and stated that he was \\"fully committed\\" to respecting IOC rules. Tokyo Governor Apologizes for Remarks Japan later won its bid for the Olympics under Inose's chairmanship. = Money scandal and resignation = In November 2013, Inose became embroiled in a scandal concerning cash he received from the Tokushukai hospital group led by Torao Takuda, father of Lower House member Takeshi Tokuda. Inose claimed to have borrowed 50 million yen as a personal loan from Tokushukai, delivered to him in cash in exchange for a written IOU in November 2012, and that he repaid the loan in cash in September 2013. The loan was interest and collateral-free, and the funds were kept in a safe deposit box rather than in a bank account, without being reported to Japanese campaign finance authorities as part of Inose's assets. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Assembly conducted four days of public questioning of Inose in December, over the course of which Inose's recollection of events changed in several respects. The Assembly then established a special committee to investigate Inose, the first incidence of the assembly formally investigating a governor. The Asahi Shimbun called for Inose's resignation in an editorial on December 12, while the Mainichi Shimbun called him \\"no longer viable\\" as a governor on the same day. A Sankei Shimbun poll released on December 16 found that 89% of Tokyo respondents thought that Inose's explanation of the funds was not credible, while 63% thought he was no longer an appropriate representative of Tokyo as an Olympic host city. Inose announced his resignation as governor on December 19, 2013, following direct pressure from various senior political figures including ex-Governor Ishihara and Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe. In his resignation speech, he characterized himself as an \\"amateur\\" at politics and expressed hope \\"that our next governor will be a real political pro who can guide Tokyo successfully through the Olympics.\\" He expressed his desire to continue writing following his resignation as governor. The Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly approved and formalized his resignation on December 24. Inose was succeeded as interim governor by Vice Governor Tatsumi Ando. His term of office as governor was the shortest in Tokyo history at only 372 days. Y≈çichi Masuzoe won the February 2014 election to determine Inose's final successor as governor. In June 2016 Masuzoe also stepped down after a money scandal.Tokyo Governor Yoichi Masuzoe resigns over spending scandal June 15, 2016 BBC News Retrieved June 16, 2016  Personal life  Inose is a runner who jogs every day, and completed the 2012 Tokyo Marathon.Daily Yomiuri Tokyo's 'weird' new governor starts term December 20, 2012 He also holds a black belt in judo.

The band embraced a heavy southern bluesy jam oriented style which led to comparisons with groups such as Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers Band, The Black Crowes, Brother Cane and Cry of Love. History The core of the band was started by college buddies, Rick White (guitarist) and Terry Thomas (drummer). After meeting Bob Watkins (guitarist), the three started occasionally jamming together in 1989. It wasn't until Rick White met singer Mike Farris, in 1991, that things really came together. When Thomas called White and Watkins for another jam session at his space at Big Red storage, they brought Farris along with them. This meeting, April 24th 1991, was the inception of the band. The band recalls it as Divine Dispensation. They immediately bonded and wrote five songs the first night that would be on the SCW self-titled CD. With the addition of Steve Burgess (bass guitar), the lineup was complete. The band chose their name from a The Far Side illustration by artist Gary Larson captioned \\"Cheetah Wheelies\\". The band added \\"Screamin'\\" (officially omitting the last letter in a nod to colloquial southern slang) and began playing local bars. The band was soon playing all the local venues including Ace of Clubs and 328 Performance Hall, but it was their residency shows at a small blues club called The Grapevine Cafe, next door to the world-famous Exit/In near Vanderbilt University, that gained industry attention. These shows were always a sold-out affair and led to the band being signed to Atlantic Records in 1993 by the infamous Jason Flom. The band released their debut, \\"The Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies\\", in 1994.[] The album reached #40 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.[ Billboard], Allmusic.com The album was recorded at Ardent Studios in Memphis and produced by Paul Ebersold. Their single, \\"Shakin' the Blues\\", reached the album-rock top ten.[] In 1996, the band released \\"Magnolia;\\" this album's varied musical styles ranged from \\"Magnolia\\", a slow-burn build-up rock and roll epic, to \\"Gypsy Lullaby\\", a delicate ode showing Farris' blistering vocals at their best. \\"Magnolia\\" was produced by Michael Barbiero and featured a guest appearance by Warren Haynes of Gov't Mule. \\"Big Wheel,\\" released in 1998, contained \\"Standing In The Sun\\" and \\"Boogie King\\", a song as much at home in the mosh pit as cruising the local drag. \\"Boogie King\\" was used on the soundtrack of the movie \\"Bride of Chucky.\\" \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\" was used in the \\"Malcolm in the Middle\\" episode \\"Home Alone 4\\" and included in \\"Songs from Malcolm in the Middle,\\" the soundtrack to the television series which was released in early 2001. The SCW went on to release five studio CDs, two live CDs total with two independent releases recorded at the Watkins home studio, Thundershack. The band toured with many notable national acts through the 90s, including Meat Loaf, Joan Osborne and the Allman Brothers Band. SCW ended their touring career in 1999 opening a double bill arena tour with ZZ Top and Lynyrd Skynyrd. The band officially went their separate ways in 2005. Their final show was at a successful festival event called Azkena Rock Festival, in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque Country in northern Spain. Since the band's dissolution, Farris has released four solo albums: \\"Goodnight Sun\\" (2002), \\"Salvation In Lights\\" (2007) on INO Records, \\"Shine for All the People\\" (2014) on Compass Records, which won a Grammy for Best Roots Gospel album. He followed that up with \\"Silver & Stone\\" (2018) on Compass. The remaining Wheelies continued performing in various combinations. Members of the band have started or joined various side projects which continue to release recordings still. These bands include: Stack, Black Mountain Prophet, and Scale Hound.

The other two canid subfamilies are the extinct Borophaginae and Hesperocyoninae. The Caninae includes all living canids and their most recent fossil relatives. Their fossils were first found in North America and dated to the Oligocene era, then spreading to Asia at the end of the Miocene era, some 7 million to 8 million years ago. Taxonomy and lineage \\"Derived characteristics that distinguish the Caninae from other canids include small, simple, well-spaced premolars, a humerus without an entepicondylar foramen, and a metatarsal 1 which is reduced to a proximal rudiment.\\" The genus Leptocyon (Greek: leptos slender + cyon dog) includes 11 species and was the first primitive canine. They were small and weighed around 2 kg. They first appeared in Sioux County, Nebraska in the Orellan era 32-34 million years ago, which was the beginning of the Oligocene. This was the same time as the appearance of the Borophaginae with whom they share features with, indicating that these were two sister groups. Borophaginae skull and dentition were designed for a powerful killing bite compared with the Leptocyon which were designed for snatching small, fast-moving prey. The species L. delicatus is the smallest canid to have existed. At the close of their genus 9 million years ago one Leptocyon lineage resembled the modern fox. Leptocyons various species branched 11.9 Mya into Vulpini (foxes) and Canini (canines). The canines spent two-thirds of their history in North America, before dispersing 7 million years ago into Asia, Europe, and Africa. One of the characteristics that distinguished them from the Borophaginae and Hesperocyoninae was their possession of less weight in their limbs and more length in their legs, which may have aided their dispersion. The first canine to arrive in Eurasia was the coyote-sized Canis cipio, whose scant fossils were found in Spain. However, the assignment of C. cipio within the canines to the genus Canis or genus Eucyon is not clear.  Phylogenetic relationships  Skulls of various canine genera; Vulpes (corsac fox), Nyctereutes (raccoon dog), Cuon (dhole), and Canis (Eurasian golden jackal) The results of allozyme and chromosome analyses have previously suggested several phylogenetic divisions: ;Canina: The wolf- like canines (genus Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon) include the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), gray wolf (Canis lupus), red wolf (Canis rufus), eastern wolf (Canis lycaon), coyote (Canis latrans), Eurasian golden jackal (Canis aureus), African golden wolf (Canis anthus), Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas), side-striped jackal (Canis adustus), dhole (Cuon alpinus), and African wild dog (Lycaon pictus). ;Cerdocyonina: The South American canines include the bush dog (Speothos venaticus), hoary fox (Lycalopex uetulus), crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), and maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus). ;Vulpini: The fox-like canines include the kit fox (Vulpes velox), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), Cape fox (Vulpes chama), Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda), the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), and the bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis). ;Urocyon: A monotypic taxon for the basal California island fox (Urocyon littoralis) and the gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). DNA analysis shows that the first three form monophyletic clades. The wolf-like canines and the South American canines together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some 10 Mya and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canines by the fennec fox and Blanford's fox. The gray fox and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported. The cladogram below is based on the phylogeny of Lindblad-Toh (2005) modified to incorporate recent findings on Canis, Vulpes, Lycalopex species, and Dusicyon.

The Public Security Ministry and the State Security Department are responsible for internal security in North Korea. Although both are government organs, they are tightly controlled by the party apparatus through the Justice and Security Commission and the penetration of their structures by the party apparatus at all levels. The formal public security structure is augmented by a pervasive system of informers throughout the society. Surveillance of citizens, both physical and electronic, is also routine. People's Security The Ministry of Public Security, responsible for internal security, social control, and basic police functions, is one of the most powerful organizations in North Korea and controls the People's Internal Security Forces, composed of an estimated 144,000 public security personnel. It maintains law and public order; investigates common criminal cases; manages the prison system and traffic control; monitors citizens' political attitudes; conducts background investigations, census, and civil registrations; controls individual travel; manages the government's classified documents; protects government and party officials; and patrols government buildings and some government and party construction activities. The ministry has vice ministers for personnel, political affairs, legal counselling, security, surveillance, internal affairs, rear services, and engineering. There are approximately twenty-seven bureaus, but the functional responsibilities of only some of the bureaus are known. The Security Bureau is responsible for ordinary law enforcement and most police functions. The Investigation Bureau handles investigations of criminal and economic crimes. The Protection Bureau is responsible for fire protection, traffic control, public health, and customs. The Registration Bureau issues citizen identification cards and maintains public records on births, deaths, marriages, residence registration, and passports. Below the ministry level, there are public security bureaus for each province and directly administered city. These bureaus are headed by either a senior colonel or a lieutenant colonel of police, depending on the size of the population. Public security departments at each city or county and smaller substations through the country are staffed by about 100 personnel. They are organized roughly parallel to the ministry itself and have several divisions responsible for carrying out various functions. North Korean uniformed civil police officers are primarily unarmed traffic officers. State Security Department In 1973 political security responsibilities were transferred from the Ministry of People's Security to the State Security Department, an autonomous agency reporting directly to Kim Il Sung. The State Security Department carries out a wide range of counterintelligence and internal security functions normally associated with \\"secret police\\" known to North Koreans as Bowibu. It is charged with searching out antistate criminals‚Äîa general category that includes those accused of anti-government and dissident activities, economic crimes, and slander of the political leadership. Camps for political prisoners are under its jurisdiction. It has counterintelligence responsibilities at home and abroad, and runs overseas intelligence collection operations. It monitors political attitudes and maintains surveillance of returnees. Ministry personnel escort high-ranking officials. The ministry also guards national borders and monitors international entry points. The degree of control it exercises over the Political Security Bureaus of the KPA‚Äîwhich has representatives at all levels of command‚Äîis unclear.Ministry of People's Security - North Korean Intelligence Agencies Border Guard The People's Border Guards are the paramilitary force of the Ministry of People's Security.

Before entering the professional ranks, Geimer won a National Amateur Cup with St. Louis Kutis in 1971. He also earned six caps, scoring two goals, with the United States in 1972 and 1973. Youth and college Geimer grew up in St. Louis and attended St. Louis University where he played both soccer and baseball. He was a two-year letterman on the baseball team in 1969 and 1970, but gained his greatest fame on the soccer field. He was a member of the Billiken‚Äôs soccer team from 1967 to 1969, starting the last two years. In 1967 and then again in 1969, the Billikins took the NCAA Men's Soccer Championship. In 2004, St. Louis University inducted Geimer into the school‚Äôs Hall of Fame. St. Louis Kutis After leaving St. Louis University, Geimer played with St. Louis Kutis of the St. Louis Municipal Leagues. In 1971, Kutis won the National Amateur Cup title. NASL In 1971, the St. Louis Stars of the North American Soccer League (NASL) drafted Geimer. He played with the Stars for five seasons. In 1972 the Stars went to the NASL championship only to fall to the New York Cosmos. However, to get there, the Stars defeated the Rochester Lancers 2-0 in the semi-finals with one goal coming from Geimer. Geimer‚Äôs most productive season came in 1973 when he finished fourth on the NASL scoring list with ten goals and five assists. At the end of the 1975 season, the Stars traded Geimer to the Boston Minutemen. He began the 1976 season with the Boston Minutemen, but was traded to the Chicago Sting after ten games. He finished the 1976 season, then spent the 1977 season with the Sting. MISL In 1978, Geimer joined the Cincinnati Kids for the first season of a new indoor soccer league, the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). He set a regular season record with seven goals in a game, a record later broken by Steve Zungul. National team Geimer earned his first cap with the U.S. national team in an August 20, 1972 loss to Canada. He scored in his second game with the national team nine days later when the U.S. tied Canada 2-2 on goals from Geimer and Willy Roy. Geimer played two more games that year, scoring again in a 2-1 loss to Mexico on September 10. His last game with the national team came in an October 16, 1973 loss to Mexico.USA - Details of International Matches 1970-1979 References External links * NASL/MISL stats Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:American soccer players Category:Boston Minutemen players Category:Chicago Sting (NASL) players Category:Cincinnati Kids players Category:Indianapolis Daredevils players Category:Major Indoor Soccer League (1978‚Äì1992) players Category:North American Soccer League (1968‚Äì1984) players Category:Sportspeople from St. Louis Category:Saint Louis Billikens men's soccer players Category:St. Louis Stars (soccer) players Category:St. Louis Kutis players Category:United States men's international soccer players Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Gene Geimer"},{"id":"11795886","text":"The extinct Hesperocyoninae are one of three subfamilies found within the canid family. The other two canid subfamilies are the extinct Borophaginae and extant Caninae. Taxonomic history Hesperocyoninae are basal canids that gave rise to the other two canid subfamilies, the Borophaginae and Caninae. This subfamily was endemic to North America, living from the Duchesnean stage of the Late Eocene through to the early Barstovian stage of the Miocene, lasting around 20 million years. It comprises 10 recognized genera and 26 recognized species; among these, four genera and species are new. Four major lineages can be defined based on shared characteristics: *Mesocyon-Enhydrocyon clade (includes Cynodesmus, Sunkahetanka, Philotrox) *Osbornodon clade *Paraenhydrocyon *Ectopocynus clade The genus Caedocyon, which is only known from a single partial cranium that shows some Paraenhydrocyon affinities, probably represents another independent lineage. Hesperocyon, which lacks the shared derived characters that would include it within any of the aforementioned clades, is possibly ancestral to many of the lineages. Some evidence indicates the Paraenhydrocyon clade may be directly descended from Hesperocyon gregarius. According to Xiaoming Wang, Hesperocyon coloradensis provides an important link between H. gregarius and the Mesocyon-Enhydrocyon clade.Wang, X. 1994. Phylogenetic systematics of the Hesperocyoninae (Carnivora, Canidae). Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, 221:1-207. Extinction According to an analysis of the fossil record of North American fossil carnivorans, the decline of hesperocyonines to extinction during the period from about 20 to 10 million years ago was driven by competition with felids and borophagines.

The National Guard, with around 33,000 officers, is attached to the Ministry of Defence. The ', with around 8,000 officers, is the primary criminal investigation agency. The new ', created in 2009, had 2,400 officers in July 2010 (with a further 1,400 in training). In addition, each of Venezuela's 23 states has its own police force, numbering around 50,000 officers altogether. Finally, since 1989's decentralization legislation, many municipalities have set up their own police forces.Birkbeck, Christopher (2009), \\"Venezuela: the shifting organizational framework for the police\\", Police Practice and Research, Volume 10, Issue 4 August 2009 , pages 295 - 304 Both state and municipal/city police forces report to the Federal Ministry of Interior, Justice and Peace through their respective state governments. History =1958-1998= In 1958 Venezuela overthrew the dictator Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez, but for much of the 1958-1998 period the criminal justice and law enforcement system established under Jim√©nez and the earlier dictator Juan Vicente G√≥mez was not substantially reformed, and \\"the criminal justice system remained a blemish on this image of democracy\\".Alguindigue, Carmen; Perdomo, Rogelio Perez (2008), \\"Inquisitor Strikes Back: Obstacles to the Reform of Criminal Procedure\\", Southwestern Journal of International Law, Vol. 15, Issue 1 (2008), pp. 101-122 A small 1987 survey found that 74% of prisoners said that the police tortured them. The police relied heavily on obtaining confession evidence, and for poor defendants a lack of effective defence lawyers \\"led to frequent convictions of innocent people\\". Other aspects of the justice system conspired to make this worse: \\"Venezuelan criminal procedure crushed poor and uneducated defendants in its Kafkaesque gears.\\" Prisons were extremely violent, with a high probability of death or rape; and about 70% of prisoners were awaiting a judge's decision. After some years of public pressure, 1998 saw the drafting of a radically reformed criminal law, which came into effect in July 1999. =2006 CONAREPOL= In 2006 a National Commission on Police Reform (CONAREPOL, from the Spanish name) conducted studies aimed at reforming the police, in consultation with police and local communities. It found that > \\"Careful study of the different police agencies makes it evident that many > do not have adequate infrastructure, and they are lacking in basic services > or the spaces that are necessary for police activities (e.g., holding > cells).

He made his professional debut in 1984 and after reaching the top makuuchi division in 1990 he remained there for 15 years until his retirement in 2005. His highest rank was sekiwake and he earned seven special prizes and eight gold stars during his long makuuchi career. He is now the head coach of Sadogatake stable. Career At junior high school he practiced judo and shot put, and even represented his prefecture at the All Tohoku Shot put Championships. He was already tall by the age of 14. He was scouted into sumo by a supporter of Sadogatake stable. He had intended to join in March 1984 alongside Kotonishiki, but failed the physical because of high blood pressure, delaying his entry by two months. At first he wrestled under the name Imano and then Kotokonno before finally settling on Kotonowaka in 1988. It took him six years to achieve sekitori status by reaching the j≈´ry≈ç division in July 1990. He first reached makuuchi in November 1990 and remained continuously in the top division from March 1991. He advanced several times into the san'yaku ranks, first making komusubi in September 1993. However he had to wait until January 1999 to achieve his highest rank of sekiwake, following a strong 10-5 showing at komusubi the previous November. Kotonowaka never won a tournament, but he nevertheless earned eight kinboshi or gold stars for victories against yokozuna while a maegashira, with three such wins coming against Takanohana. He defeated Asashoryu twice as a yokozuna, and also looked to have defeated him in July 2004, but the judges controversially called for a rematch after deciding that Asashoryu had in fact not hit the ground before Kotonowaka touched down. Kotonowaka lost the rematch, but NHK received calls from viewers saying that Asashoryu was shini-tai (\\"dead body\\") and should have lost the first bout. He also received five Fighting Spirit and two Outstanding Achievement prizes in the course of his long career, the first coming in July 1995, nearly five years after his top division debut. He was ranked in the top division for 90 tournaments, which is the eighth best in history, and he was one of only a handful of wrestlers to win over 600 top division bouts. He was relatively injury-free until March 2000, when he suffered a serious injury to his left knee in training which was to bother him for the rest of his career. He injured the knee again in November 2003 and was the last wrestler to be able to take advantage of the kosho seido (public injury) system before its abolition, sitting out the January 2004 tournament without affecting his ranking. His good looks meant he was popular with female sumo fans. Fighting style Kotonowaka relied strongly on countering techniques against his opponents, and his bouts were often relatively long as compared to most other wrestlers. This proclivity led to him receiving the nickname \\"Mr. Ippun\\" (\\"Mr. One-Minute\\"). He favoured a migi-yotsu (left hand outside, right hand inside) grip on his opponent's mawashi. His speciality was uwatenage, or the overarm throw, which he used to win over 20 percent of his matches (the average is only 7 percent). Retirement from sumo During the 2005 November tournament, in which, at 37, he was the oldest rikishi in his division, he announced his retirement. He took over immediately as stable master of Sadogatake stable, as the previous head, former yokozuna Kotozakura, had reached the mandatory retirement age of 65. Kotonowaka had been in line to inherit the stable ever since he had married Kotozakura's daughter in March 1996, and changed his legal name from Mitsuya Konno to Mitsuya Kamatani. Kotonowaka oversaw the promotion of Kotomitsuki to ≈çzeki in July 2007, and Koto≈çsh≈´'s first top division championship in May 2008. The first wrestler from his stable to be promoted to the top division since he took over was Kotokasuga, also in May 2008. He produced his first new sekitori, Kotokuni, in January 2009, followed by Kotoyutaka in July 2009, although neither were able to maintain a position in j≈´ry≈ç . In July 2010 Kotomitsuki was dismissed from sumo for illegal betting on professional baseball, and Sadogatake was punished for his lack of supervision of his top wrestler by being demoted two ranks in the Sumo Association's hierarchy. In 2011 Sadogatake saw Kotoy≈´ki reach the sekitori ranks, and Kotosh≈çgiku was promoted to ≈çzeki, the first Japanese wrestler to reach the rank since Kotomitsuki. Kotoy≈´ki became his first makuuchi debutant in January 2013. Family Kotonowaka's son Masakatsu Kamatani was born in November 1997, and in November 2015 joined Sadogatake stable using the fighting name Kotokamatani. He won the jonokuchi championship in January 2016 and reached the makushita division in September 2016. Following the May 2019 tournament he was promoted to the second j≈´ry≈ç division, adopting his fathers‚Äô shikona Kotonowaka. It is understood that he will inherit his grandfather's shikona of Kotozakura if he reaches the ≈çzeki rank.

As a result, this was the final opportunity for many spectators to see their sporting heroes in an international setting, as players such as Wales's Dai Astley or Scotland's Tommy Walker would no longer be young enough to play for their country by the time professional football began again in 1946. The opening matches saw an immediate advantage for Wales and Scotland who beat England and Northern Ireland respectively. Scotland then followed by beating the Welsh in their second match during a close contest whilst England succeeded in victory over the Irish by a seven-goal margin to bring them into joint second place behind the Scots. During the match, Willie Hall scored five goals, an English record that has been equalled but never broken as of 2007. In the final games, Wales beat the Irish resulting in a whitewash of three defeats for Ireland and joint first place for the Welsh.

Cloister Hill  Map of √Öbo after the 1827 fire. Destroyed areas are in grey. The surviving area, now the museum, is the red section to the South East This area of Cloister Hill was developed relatively late for pre-fire √Öbo, from around 1775, after another fire. It was decided that the previously undeveloped, although not uninhabited, area to the south of Vartiovuori Hill would be developed as residential accommodation. The South of this area was less rocky and easier to build upon, so was developed first. Plots were surveyed officially, then the plot holder would develop within that plot as and when they saw fit. These first surveyed plots still form the boundaries within the current museum. Three plots: 158‚Äì160 appear on the maps of 1780, by 1800 171, 176, 178‚Äì189 are included and the 1808 map (the basis of the post- fire map illustrated) includes the whole extent of the museum site. The original occupations of the first inhabitants are represented by the buildings now within the museum. Some were building trades, such as carpenters and a stonemason, and probably built their own properties. The plot would be fenced in and a simple cottage with a stove and baking oven built. Other buildings might be provided for domestic animals. In time, the buildings would expand around the perimeter of the plot, enclosing a courtyard.  The museum  The museum consists of 18 blocks of original 18th-century ‚Äì early 19th-century buildings on their original location. The area of the museum was the only old residential area left in 1940, when the museum was opened. The location was the largest area to completely survive the Great Fire of Turku. The idea for the museum was put forward in a local newspaper article as early as 1908, after the oldest part of Cloister Hill had been demolished ‚Äì now the street of Sirkkalankatu. The idea was rejected for nearly 30 years, until the city's new museum committee was convinced to create a museum in the style of Den Gamle By, an earlier museum in Aarhus, Denmark. Nine blocks formed the original museum, the others being added in 1956. Expansion has continued since, with more buildings having their interiors refitted for display. On their addition to the museum, the houses were still decorated in the contemporary fashion of the 1930s. They were carefully recorded, then the interiors refitted to the style of the Great Fire period. This often involved removing ceilings of tongue and groove boards, or the restoration of open fireplaces. Some residents remained living in the museum area even after it opened, the last, Hilma M√§enp√§√§, remaining there until her death in 1982. The museum received the Golden Apple international tourism award as the only site in Scandinavia in 1984.

It is named after Sylvanus Thayer, West Point class of 1808, the \\"father of the Military Academy.\\" It replaced the West Point Hotel. The Thayer Hotel has three main markets: tourists visiting West Point, weddings, and corporate conferences. The Thayer Hotel came under new management in October 2009. The 151-room hotel has been completely renovated, re-branded, and is now being marketed to host corporate events and leadership training. Renovations completed at The Thayer Hotel in 2012, have brought about the opening of its new executive suite wing, which includes 23 suite-style rooms. History Thayer Hotel in the winter In 1829, the West Point Hotel was built near the Plain on Trophy Point. The West Point Hotel served the academy for over a century, hosting a long list of dignitaries such as Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant, Stonewall Jackson, Winfield Scott, William Tecumseh Sherman, Washington Irving, Edgar Allan Poe, and James Whistler. Perhaps that hotel's history is tied most famously to one of West Point's most famous graduates, General Douglas MacArthur. During General Douglas MacArthur's time as a cadet, his mother lived in the West Point Hotel. When Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur returned from World War I to become the Superintendent of West Point, he started a major expansion program of the buildings. The new Thayer Hotel was one of these expansion projects and the Thayer Hotel officially opened May 27, 1926 with 225 rooms. General MacArthur would return to West Point and stay in the hotel in 1962 for one final time to give his noted \\"Duty, Honor, Country\\" speech to the cadets as he received the Thayer Award. The former Iranian hostages were housed at the hotel immediately upon their return to the United States. The former hostages spent the night at the hotel and signed a menu which is still on display in the lobby, as well as a brass plaque given by the former hostages to the Thayer Hotel thanking the hotel for welcoming them home. The 151 room Thayer Hotel has undergone several renovations over the years- most recently in 2012, with the opening of the 23-room executive suite wing. The Thayer Hotel is listed as a Historic Hotel of America. The main conference rooms and public spaces are all named after prominent Americans who were instrumental in West Point's history. The hotel has named the \\"President George Washington Ballroom\\" (who first headquartered at West Point in 1779); President Thomas Jefferson Patio (founded the US Military Academy in 1802); President Ulysses S. Grant Room (class of 1843); President Dwight D. Eisenhower Room (class of 1915); \\"General Douglas MacArthur Room (class of 1903); General of the Armies John J. Pershing Room (class of 1886 who led ally armies in WWI); General Omar Bradley Room (class of 1915); and General George S. Patton Tavern (class of 1909). Room Dedication Program The room dedication program has recently been implemented at The Thayer Hotel. Each guest room is dedicated to a distinguished graduate of West Point. Each room's d√©cor reflects the accomplishments of an individual who has made significant contributions to the nation and the world. Only the most accomplished and distinguished have a room at The Thayer Hotel named and decorated in their honor. All chosen honorees, selected by committee, are now part of the hotel's history. Their names and accomplishments are listed as part of a dedication display that has created a museum inside of a hotel. Some notable graduates of West Point who have a room dedicated to them include: General Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Brigadier General Rebecca Halstead, the first female United States Military Academy graduate general officer.

In 1894, Gerlinger bought the existing Young's Brewery in Vancouver, Washington. He promptly renamed it Star Brewing Company to reflect the change in product line.

On May 29, 1903, the first train ran from Dallas to Falls City. At the end of June, passenger trains began regularly scheduled trips to and from Dallas and Falls City each day; the nine-mile (14 km), forty-minute, one-way trip cost 35 cents. Two of Gerlinger's sons, George T. Gerlinger and Louis Gerlinger Jr., managed the railway.

In 1901, Carl went to the US as an engineer aboard a Hamburg-American Line ship. When it docked in Tacoma, Washington, Carl was taken to the Tacoma Hospital suffering from malaria. Louis Gerlinger, Sr., Carl's uncle, persuaded Carl to make his home in Portland, Oregon. There he worked for the Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navigation Co. (OWR&N;).

He decided to concentrate on inventing. Among his inventions are the oil distributor, oil retort and spark arrestors for locomotives. Working for the Southern Pacific Railroad (which had purchased the SFC&W; once owned by Carl's uncle), he was quickly promoted and was the general foreman of the shops at Dallas). In 1918, Gerlinger, a gifted machinist and business leader, invested his savings into Ed Biddlle's Dallas Iron Works. A year later it became Dallas Machine & Locomotive Works which employed a dozen men. Business expanded quickly from manufacturing logging and railroad equipment. In 1920 they rebuilt nine locomotives and twelve in 1923. Next came the Gerlinger Carrier, a machine that could load and unload lumber. This business led to the Gerlinger Carrier Company, a manufacturer of both straddle carriers and forklift trucks. The company eventually merged with Towmotor and Caterpillar Tractor in the 1950s. In the 1970s, the business returned to family control. Today, the carriers are manufactured in nearby Salem, by G.C.C., Inc., which is controlled by one of Carl's descendants, and run by Mark Lyman and Ron Lyman.

Magnetic separation was typically limited and moderately effective. Magnetic separators that used permanent magnets could generate fields of low intensity only. These worked well in removing ferrous tramp but not fine paramagnetic particles. Thus high- intensity magnetic separators that were effective in collecting paramagnetic particles came into existence. These focus on the separation of very fine particles that are paramagnetic. The current is passed through the coil, which creates a magnetic field, which magnetizes the expanded steel matrix ring. The paramagnetic matrix material behaves like a magnet in the magnetic field and thereby attracts the fines. The ring is rinsed when it is in the magnetic field and all the non-magnetic particles are carried with the rinse water. Next as the ring leaves the magnetic zone the ring is flushed and a vacuum of about ‚Äì 0.3 bars is applied to remove the magnetic particles attached to the matrix ring. Standard operating procedure High-gradient magnetic separator is to separate magnetic and non-magnetic particles (concentrate and tails) from the feed slurry. This feed comes from intermediate thickener underflow pump through Linear Screen & Passive Matrix. Tailings go to tailing thickener & product goes to throw launder through vacuum tanks. Ion separation Ion separation is another application of magnetic separation. The separation is driven by the magnetic field that induces a separating force. The force differentiate then between heavy and lighter ions causing the separation. This phenomenon has been demonstrated on test bench and pilot scale.Maxwell Application Technologies References Category:Industrial processes Category:Separation processes Category:Magnetic devices ","title":"High-intensity magnetic separator"},{"id":"11796196","text":"Helianthella, the little sunflower, is a genus of North American plants in the sunflower family.Torrey, John, & Asa Gray. 1842.

(Eriksen 1974:200).) was a French neoclassical architect with an unsatisfactory career largely spent in Germany. His artistic personality remained shadowy until recently, though he was allowed to have had numerous pupils among the avant- garde of neoclassicism. He won the Prix de Rome in architecture in 1732, which, after an unaccountable delay, sent him for study to the French Academy in Rome from December 1738 to January 1742, when the Director, Jean Fran√ßois de Troy, remarked of him on his departure \\"il y a du feu et du g√©nie\\".\\"There's some fire and genius there\\". Gilbert Erouart, with a large body of Le Geay's drawings and etchings to judge from (Erouart 1983) concluded that de Troy's kindly words had been blown out of proportion by art historians. After he returned to Paris, there is no record of him, but about 1745 he was in Berlin, where he published eight etchings (1747‚Äì48) of plans and elevations for St Hedwig's Church (today's St. Hedwig's Cathedral), Berlin, which he produced in collaboration with Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, until recently the chief architect to Frederick II of Prussia; the church was eventually built to a modified version of the plan, by Johann Boumann, from June 1748, and Johann Gottfried B√ºring, in 1772‚Äì3. Le Geay served as architect to Christian Ludwig II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin from October 1748 until the Duke's death in 1756. For him he designed the formal water-garden at Schwerin, but built nothing; his project for Ludwigslust remained on paper, and his assistant, Johann Joachim Busch began the work in 1763, after Le Geay's departure. In 1756 he was appointed first architect to Frederick of Prussia. For Frederick he designed a Communs (or service-wing), in the form of semicircular colonnades flanked by domed and porticoed pavilions, to stand before the Neues Palais, Potsdam; the project was realized in 1765-66 to slightly altered designs by Carl von Gontard. He added a ballroom to the schloss at Rostock (Eriksen 1974; Erouart 1982) but after quarrelling with the King in 1763, Le Geay seems to have built little. He spent two years, 1766‚Äì67, in England (Eriksen 1974:200), fruitlessly, though Sir William Chambers took the opportunity to copy some of his drawings,They were pasted into Chambers' sketchbook of his continental travels, from 1749-54 (Middleton 1983:767), raising some confusion that for some years gave them an unwarranted early date and suggested phantoms of Le Geay's early role in neoclassicism, deflated by Gilbert Erouart. then returned to Paris, where he published four extravagantly idiosyncratic suites of etchings of fountains, ruins, tombs, and vases, dated 1767-68, which were collected as Collection de Divers Sujets de Vases, Tombeaux, Ruines, et Fontaines Utiles aux Artistes Invent√©e et Grav√©e par J.-L. Le Geay, Architecte (1770). They provide a large array of neoclassical motifs in the go√ªt grec, but their presumed origin in Rome in the 1740s,John Harris, \\"Le Geay, Piranesi and international neo-classicism in Rome\\" Essays in the History of Architecture presented to Rudolf Wittkower (New York) 1969, pp 189-96. has been disproved (Erouart 1982), though they show the influence of Giambattista Piranesi.Emil Kaufmann began the inflated reassessment of Le Geay in 1952, suggesting that the influence might have been the other way round: \\"it may be that the famous Piranesi style could better be termed the Le Geay style,\\" Kaufmann wrote, in \\"Three revolutionary architects: Boull√©e, Ledoux and Lequeu\\" Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1952:452). Le Geay taught √âtienne-Louis Boull√©e, Pierre-Louis Moreau-Desproux, Marie-Joseph Peyre, and Charles De Wailly, through whom his influence on neoclassical developments was more important than the direct influence of anything he built. Gilbert Erouart, examining Le Geay's surviving paintings and drawings, concluded that, rather than the eminence grise of neoclassicism, Le Geay's contribution had been limited to painterly techniques of picturesque presentation drawings.

This followed the introduction of each individual character in mid-1970s Iron Fist stories. Publication history The pair was first referred to by the name Daughters of the Dragon canonically in Marvel Team-Up #64 (December 1977). In the context of the story, the name comes from an attempted slight from Iron Fist foe Davos, the Steel Serpent, said in a tongue-in-cheek way while he flees from the two heroines.Marvel Team-Up #64 Despite the Daughters of the Dragon being given co-star billing in the issue, they appear in action for only a handful of panels, foreshadowing their status as perennial supporting characters who rarely starred in stories of their own. Since Iron Fist's first series had been canceled at that time, the two characters followed him into the new Power Man and Iron Fist series (a merging of the Power Man and Iron Fist series), with Colleen and Misty as supporting cast, who operated Knightwing Restorations Inc. Among the few stories to feature the Daughters of the Dragon as the stars were 8-page stories appearing in Marvel Comics Presents #42 (January 1990), #80 (April 1991), and #149 (March 1994). The first two of these stories were written by former Power Man and Iron Fist writer Mary Jo Duffy. In late 2005/early 2006 they gained a limited series which introduced both the style and many of the plots and characters that were later featured in the 2006 Heroes for Hire series. The Daughters of the Dragon received an entry in the All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #3 (2006). Misty Knight and Colleen Wing were featured in the Luke Cage and Iron Fist Netflix series, which take place in a shared universe. Both characters were eventually paired, as in the comic. The success of the duo led Marvel to launch a new Daughters of the Dragon comic in 2018, by Jed MacKay and Travel Foreman. It was released as a digital comic. In other media An intended Daughters of the Dragon TV series was in development in 2001, but was never produced.

On his retirement from playing football, he wrote for the Daily Record and The Celtic View. He was the elder brother of Billy McPhail, also a former Celtic player. Playing career Born in Lambhill, Glasgow, McPhail attended St Mungo's Academy before signing for the club he supported, in October 1941, aged just 17. He initially played as a right half and soon earned a nickname, \\"Hooky\\" due to his tendency to kick the football with the outside of his boot. The name stuck with him throughout his life. His early years with Celtic coincided with a period of domination by their Old Firm rivals, Rangers. In 1948, McPhail was part of the Celtic team that only narrowly avoided relegation on the last day of the season. However, he did earn a winners medal in the Victory In Europe Cup in 1945. In 1950 McPhail was transformed into a centre forward, a move that revitalised his career. During this season, he was \\"his side's inspiration, and the idol of the supporters\\", according to author and historian Tom Campbell in Glasgow Celtic 1945-1970.Tom Campbell, Glasgow Celtic 1945-1970, Civic Press, 1970 He captained the team to a Scottish Cup victory in 1951, scoring 7 of the club's 19 goals in that competition, and the only goal of the final. This marked the first Cup success for the club in 14 years; it was followed by with a Coronation Cup victory in 1953 and a league championship title in 1954.James E. Handley, The Celtic Story, 1960 It was in this period McPhail earned 5 caps for Scotland, scoring 3 goals. He also played for the Scottish League. By 1954 McPhail had begun to struggle to maintain his match fitness and he only played for the Celtic first team intermittently. Journalist, Archie Macpherson recounts that McPhail admitted to him that he began to adopt the \\"ageing remedy of the Hungarian international Ferenc Pusk√°s, shortening the stride and increasing the number of steps he took to lend the false impression of pace.\\" Additional problems curtailed his career further, including a family crisis and bankruptcy as a business venture went wrong. His younger brother, Billy McPhail also played for Celtic, and is widely remembered for scoring a hat-trick in Celtic's 7-1 victory over rivals Rangers in the 1957 Scottish League Cup. John McPhail also scored three goals against Rangers, in the 1950 Glasgow Merchants' Charity Cup. This is the only occasion in Old Firm history that brothers have achieved this feat. Retirement On 5 May 1956 McPhail retired from professional football, having spent 14 years with just one senior club. He went on to work as a journalist with the Daily Record for over ten years. He then wrote for The Celtic View in the years following its launch. McPhail was married, and had two daughters and a son, also called John. He died in Glasgow on 6 November 2000.

A former amateur sumo champion, he made his professional debut in 1994 and reached a highest rank of sekiwake in 1997. He fought in the top makuuchi division for twelve years, won five special prizes and earned seven gold stars for defeating yokozuna. He retired in 2008 and is now a sumo coach. In February 2010 he took over the running of Kataonami stable. Career He entered professional sumo in January 1994, after having practiced sumo at Chuo University. He joined Kataonami stable, adopting the shikona (fighting name) of Tamakasuga (\\"Tama\\", meaning \\"jewel\\", being a common prefix at his stable). Because of his achievements in amateur sumo he was allowed to enter at the bottom of the third makushita division, skipping the lower divisions. After steady but unspectacular progress he reached the j≈´ry≈ç division in March 1995 and was promoted to the top division five tournaments after that, in January 1996. He scored ten wins in his top division debut and was awarded the Fighting Spirit prize. Tamakasuga had a long career in the top makuuchi division of sumo, earning seven gold stars for defeating yokozuna. He upset yokozuna Akebono, Wakanohana and Takanohana in three successive tournaments from September 1998 to January 1999. The highest rank he achieved was sekiwake, but he never achieved a kachi-koshi win/loss ratio as a san'yaku wrestler, managing only a 7‚Äì8 score in his sekiwake debut, and then a 6‚Äì9 as komusubi in the next tournament. Subsequently, he spent his career either as a rank and file maegashira, or fighting his way back into the top division, as he was demoted to j≈´ry≈ç a number of times. Tamakasuga made something of a comeback in 2006, and was awarded the Technique Prize in July of that year, following his 11‚Äì4 performance which gave him his best ever top division score and a share of third place. His previous special prize, for Outstanding Performance, was in May 1997, 55 tournaments earlier. This is the longest ever gap between awards. He was promoted all the way up to maegashira 4 in September 2007, fighting the top rankers for the first time in several years. He remained in makuuchi until July 2008, where he was the oldest man in the top division, but could only manage three wins in that tournament and withdrew on the final day, citing a neck injury. Fighting style Tamakasuga was a solidly oshi-sumo wrestler, relying on pushes to the opponent's chest as opposed to grabbing the mawashi. His most popular winning technique was oshi- dashi, a simple push-out. He also frequently employed pull-down moves such as hataki-komi and hiki-otoshi.Tamakasuga Bouts by Kimarite- Sumo Reference Retirement from sumo He announced his retirement in September 2008, at the age of 36, after posting a losing record in that tournament. He remained in the sumo world as a coach at Kataonami stable, under the toshiyori (elder) name Tateyama-oyakata. His danpatsu-shiki, or official retirement ceremony, was held at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan on 30 May 2009. In February 2010 he swapped elder names with his old head coach (former sekiwake Tamanofuji) and took charge of the stable. Tamakasuga has an asteroid named after him. Known as 8432 Tamakasuga, it was named by astronomers at an observatory in his home prefecture.

He was among a group who asked unsuccessfully that the bomb not be dropped on civilian targets. After his Los Alamos stint, Weissman went to the Washington University in St. Louis in 1946 becoming a full professor in 1955. At Washington University, Weissman worked with others developing the use of electron spin resonance. He was one of the first, probably in parallel with Clyde Hutchison, to measure the hyperfine splitting of the ESR line caused by the interaction with nuclear spins. This hyperfine splitting is the main source of the sensitivity of ESR to the chemical environment of the electron, and hence it underlies the broad applications of ESR in chemistry. Much of his work concerned the way this interaction term behaves as molecules tumble around in solution or undergo chemical reactions. He also investigated the special non-equilibrium ESR effects which are found as reactions take place.

It is considered an introduced species in North America, where it is known as Dovefoot Geranium or Awnless Geranium. Although non-native in parts of its range, this species poses little threat to native ecosystems.E-FLORA BC: ELECTRONIC ATLAS OF THE FLORA OF BRITISH COLUMBIA It is found in dry meadows, hedges, banks and forest edges. It prefers sunny places on sandy and relatively dry soils, at an altitude of above sea level. Herbal medicine Nicholas Culpeper in his herbal of 1652 suggested a variety of uses for G. molle, including the treatment of internal and external injuries. A note was made that the bruised leaf healed external injuries faster. A decoction in wine was said to relieve gout and other joint pains.

She was executed by hanging. Personal life Ann's maiden name is not known, nor the place of her birth. Thomas Greenslade was her first husband and they had five children (Thomas Jr., Ruth, John, Samuel, and James). After Thomas' death in 1674, she was hired by Jacob Pudeator to nurse his alcoholic wife, who died in 1675. Ann then married Jacob in 1676. Jacob died in 1682, leaving Ann well-off. Some have theorized that Ann Pudeator's likely occupation as a nurse and midwife, along with her being a woman of property, made her vulnerable to charges of witchcraft. Witch trials When she was accused of witchcraft, the inventory of Goody Pudeator's alleged misdeeds included: * Presenting the Devil's Book to a girl and forcing her to sign it * Bewitchment causing the death of a neighbor's wife * Appearing in spectral form to afflicted girls * Having witchcraft materials in her home, which she claimed was grease for making soap * Torturing with pins * Causing a man to fall out of a tree * Killing her own second husband and his first wife * Turning herself into a bird and flying into her house Many of these allegations were made by Mary Warren, one of the so-called \\"afflicted girls\\". Her other accusers were Ann Putnam Jr., John Best Sr., John Best Jr., and Samuel Pickworth. Ann Pudeator was tried and sentenced to death on , 1692, along with Alice Parker, Dorcas Hoar, Mary Bradbury, and Mary Easty. She was hanged on Gallows Hill in Salem Town on . It is not known where she is buried, but a memorial stone for her exists at the Salem Witch Trials Memorial in Salem. Ann's son Thomas testified against George Burroughs at his trial for witchcraft. George Burroughs was executed in August; Thomas testified after Burrough's hanging in a desperate effort to save his mother's life. In October 1710, the General Court passed an act reversing the convictions of those for whom their families had pleaded, but Ann Pudeator was not among them. Pudeator was exonerated in 1957 by the Massachusetts General Court, partly because of the efforts of Lee Greenslit, a Midwestern textbook publisher who learned about Pudeator's execution while researching his family origins.

The structure of combat commands was task-organized and so the forces assigned to a combat command often varied from mission to mission. Abbreviations Combat command is most often abbreviated by one of the related derivative notations: * CCA, or CC-A or CC A * CCB, or CC-B or CC B * CCC, or CC-C or CC C (an older convention for \\"reserve formation\\") * CCR, or CC-R or CC R (for Combat Command Reserve) History The concept of the combat command was developed by General Adna Chaffee during the 1930s. Chaffee's concept envisaged combined arms mechanized units with no formal structure. When the first U.S. armored divisions were organized a few years later, Chaffee's concepts for the combat command were incorporated into the divisional structure.Coffey, p. 42. The combat command was a flexible organization that did not have dedicated battalions. Instead, tank, armored infantry, and armored field artillery battalions, as well as smaller units of tank destroyers, engineers, and mechanized cavalry were assigned as needed in order to accomplish any given mission.McGrath, pp. 48‚Äì49. During a U.S. Army reorganization in the 1960s, the term combat command fell out of favor and was replaced by the designation brigade. While flexible, this task-force organization lacked the high cohesion characteristic of traditional regiments that always kept the same group of battalions together. The organization of the combat command contrasted with that of the infantry, who employed reinforced infantry regiments with permanently assigned infantry battalions. This type of infantry organization was called a regimental combat team. Use of combat commands was first specified in Armored Force Tentative Table of Organization A, for armored divisions, dated December 22, 1941. The initial organization envisioned two combat command headquarters at the disposal of the armored division. The combat command headquarters themselves were small, fielding only five light tanks and 56 men. Revisions to this structure in 1943 resulted in a headquarters of three light tanks and 99 men. The 1943 structure also allowed for three combat command headquarters in an armored division. Within the armored division, the combat commands were named \\"A\\", \\"B\\", and later, \\"R\\" (for Reserve).\\"While still at Camp Cooke the division also started developing the combat command type of tactical headquarters. CC A was first commanded by Brig. Gen. Wood and later, by Brig. Gen. Harold W. Blakely, CC B's first commander was Brig. Gen. Serene E. Brett. CC A's tactical units included: the 34th Armored Regiment, 71st Armored Field Artillery Battalion, and the 1st Battalion of the 46th Armored Infantry Regiment. CC B's organization consisted of: the 81st Armored Regiment, 47th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, and the 2nd Battalion of the 46th. The remainder of the units formed what was known as the Division Reserve.\\", Paths_of_Armor, p. 8. Thus, historical accounts of U.S. armored divisions of this period refer to \\"Combat Command B\\" or \\"CCB\\" and so forth. During the latter stages of World War II in Europe, armored divisions tended to fight with CCA and CCB, while moving worn-out battalions into CCR for rest and refit, though this was not always the case.Some armored used CCR as an operational combat element of the division as well, such as the 7th Armored Division's use of CCR during the reduction of the Ruhr Pocket and the 12th Armored Division's CCR spearhead outpacing CCA and CCR in the XXI Corps' dash for Austria in the final weeks of the war.UNITED STATES ARMY IN WORLD WAR II, Special Studies, CHRONOLOGY 1941-1945 The 5th Armored Division used CCR as a combat element during the entire campaign in northwestern Europe. See Paths_of_Armor for details, particularly the biography section for Colonel Glen H. Anderson, the CCR commander. In 1954, CCR was redesignated \\"Combat Command C\\" (CCC). The combat command proved to be the forerunner of modern U.S. Army organizational structure for divisions. In the early 1960s, divisions were restructured as part of the Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD), in which all divisions, including infantry, were organized with three brigades which also did not have dedicated battalions and could be assigned as many battalions as needed for a mission. With the transition to ROAD divisions, the term combat command was no longer employed by the U.S. Army. Notes  Citations   General sources * Rod Coffey, Doctrinal Orphan or Active Partner?

There were claims also that the guards drank excessively and misbehaved whilst under the influence, did not speak English or Pashto (as they were largely Gurkhas) and had not been properly equipped to carry out their work. On 4 September 2009, the US State department announced that eight private security guards and some of their managers would be fired.Cole, August, Firm Fires U.S. Embassy Guards in Kabul, The Wall Street Journal, September 5, 2009 Several days later on September 10, the Project on Government Oversight offered further details on the company's problems with upholding its obligations at the embassy as outlined in a $189 million contract. A federal complaint was filed over the company's \\"serious and chronic under-staffing,\\" the \\"language and communications violations committed by personnel,\\" the \\"numerous instances of making false statements, misrepresentations and withholding information from the State,\\" and \\"jeopardizing the safety of the guard force via the purchase of cheaper, sub- par armored vehicles.\\" The report also said that ArmorGroup demonstrated \\"a pattern of blatant and longstanding violations\\" leading to a \\"pervasive breakdown\\" in discipline, morale and security at the embassy.POGO Statement on ArmorGroup Whistleblower Lawsuit Filed Today: State Department Accountability Remains Key Management Issue, POGO, 10 September 2009 On Sept. 14th, witnesses and panelists at a Commission on Wartime Contracting hearing urged the U.S. State Department to cancel its Afghanistan contract with ArmorGroup for massive failures, deficiencies and \\"egregious violations.\\"State Urged to Cancel Kabul Embassy Security Contract, Government Executive, 14 September 2009 On 27 October 2010, the Department of State's Office Inspector General released a report finding that AGNA had not been able to recruit, train, or manage the Kabul Embassy Security Force (\\"KESF\\") at the staffing level or the quality required by its contract with the Department of State. They also found that AGNA had employed Nepalese guards without verifiable experience, training, or background investigations in violation of its contract.Kabul Embassy Security Force, Department of State, Office of Inspector General In July 2011, the US Department of Justice announced that ArmorGroup paid the US government $7.5 million to resolve issues stemming from false claims the company made regarding charges for its services at the embassy. The payment also covered claims that its employees violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), and that management was aware of this, as well as allegations that ArmorGroup misrepresented the prior work experience of 38 national guards it hired. Additional allegations stated that the company had failed to comply with Foreign Ownership, Control and Influence mitigation requirements on the contract, as well as those outlined in a separate contract to provide guard services at a US naval support facility in Bahrain.Armor Group North America and Its Affiliates Pay $7.5 Million to Resolve False Claims Act Allegations, United States Department of Justice, 7 July 2011 As of 15 June 2012 AGNA has turned over security responsibilities for the embassy to Aegis Defense Services LLC, an American branch of Aegis Ltd. Warlord and Sex Trafficking Scandal in Afghanistan On Oct. 7, 2010, the Senate Armed Services Committee released a report detailing how ArmorGroup turned to local, Afghan warlords to provide most of the guard force at a US airbase in the Herat Province in Western Afghanistan. The report included statements from many, including an army sergeant, who said that one of the warlords used by the company \\"would provide money because of his contracting jobs with ArmorGroup. He had a lot of money from that and he would give that money to Taliban commanders, and they in turn would buy weapons and ammo, whatever they needed.\\"Senate Armed Services Committee Releases Report on the Role and Oversight of DoD's Private Security Contractors in Afghanistan, Senator Carl Levin, 7 October 2010 According to Gordon's lawsuit on or about November 8, 2007, ArmorGroup North America deputy program manager Jimmy Lemon informed James Gordon, a former ArmorGroup director of operations, and Puja Power, the acting director of human resources, that AGNA's armorer (the official in charge of the upkeep of small arms, machine guns and ammunition) was not properly performing his duties and had recently been forcibly removed during work hours from a brothel in Kabul. Gordon instructed Power to initiate action to terminate him at once. Gordon knew that the procurement of commercial sex acts by AGNA employees violated the laws of the United States and the Kabul Embassy contract. He was concerned both because the frequenting of brothels by AGNA personnel raised security concerns about the guard force's ability to safeguard the US Embassy and because it was well known that young Chinese girls were trafficked to Kabul for commercial sexual exploitation, in violation of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. The act and its implementing regulations prohibit contractors, like ArmorGroup and their employees, from engaging in severe forms of trafficking in persons and from procuring commercial sex acts during the period of performance of the contract. According to the US State Department's 2008 Trafficking in Persons Report, Afghanistan is a destination for women and girls from China, Iran and Tajikistan trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. Afghan children also are trafficked within the country for sexual exploitation.http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/KJ06Df03.html The Danny Fitzsimons Case On February 28, 2011, Danny Fitzsimons, a British employee of ArmorGroup, was sentenced to twenty years in prison for killing two colleagues and attempting to murder an Iraqi man.

The author wrote, \\"I have written The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying as the quintessence of the heart-advice of all my masters, to be a new Tibetan Book of the Dead and a Tibetan Book of Life.\\" The book explores: the message of impermanence; evolution, karma and rebirth; the nature of mind and how to train the mind through meditation; how to follow a spiritual path in this day and age; the practice of compassion; how to care for and show love to the dying, and spiritual practices for the moment of death. In his foreword to the book, the 14th Dalai Lama says: Conception and writing =Background= According to Daniel Goleman, Rinpoche was already planning to write a book on living and dying in the late 1970s. In 1983, he met Elizabeth K√ºbler-Ross, Kenneth Ring and other figures in the caring professions and near-death research, and they encouraged him to develop his work in opening up the Tibetan teachings on death and helping the dying.Rigpa Wiki  About Rigpa Rinpoche continued to teach throughout the world. Then, in 1989 in Nepal, Rinpoche met Andrew Harvey and invited him to help on the project. =Writing process= Hundreds of hours of Sogyal Rinpoche's teachings on audio-cassettes were gathered and transcribed. In 1991, Andrew Harvey and Patrick Gaffney moved into a small house in California, selected for the creative process, and close to Sogyal Rinpoche's residence. They began to draft the first chapters of the book based on Rinpoche‚Äôs oral teachings, regularly visiting Rinpoche, who would correct them and provide new ideas. More was done in London, but the most intense period of all began in Paris, at the end of 1991. Later, while Rinpoche was leading retreats in Germany and Australia, he would send through long faxes to Gaffney and Harvey full of corrections, changes and new paragraphs. He was testing the key chapters, for example on the Nature of Mind, the practice of meditation, compassion, Guru Yoga and Dzogchen, by teaching them directly, again and again, all over the world in retreats and courses. Some parts were corrected and re-written twenty five times. The final changes were composed in July 1992, during the three- month retreat which Rinpoche conducted at his European retreat centre, Lerab Ling, in France. Of the process, Patrick Gaffney said, Publication history The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying was first launched in the United States in September 1992, where it received high acclaim and spent several weeks at the top of the bestseller lists.'Best Sellers'.

The book‚Äôs success contributed to an expansion of the work of Rigpa, the network of Buddhist centres and groups set up by Sogyal Rinpoche in the 1970s.The History of Rigpa 1992-1996 It also prompted Rigpa to introduce a Spiritual Care Education and Training programme, providing for the needs of caregivers.History and Development of the Spiritual Care Program A major conference held at Germering, near Munich in 1996 and involving several leading authorities on care for the dying, had a considerable influence on the emerging hospice movement in Germany.

Lopez, Jr. characterized the book's many references to, and quotations from, prominent figures of Classical and European history as \\"cosmopolitan eclecticism\\", saying that Sogyal Rinpoche places Tibetan wisdom \\"in a global and a historical spiritual lineage of thinkers that no other Tibetan author has ever cited.\\" The religious studies scholar Huston Smith said, ‚ÄúI have encountered no book on the interplay of life and death that is more comprehensive, practical and wise. The perspective is forthrightly and profoundly Tibetan, but it is expounded so clearly that the reader has no trouble discerning on every page its universal import.‚ÄùHarper Collins  Critical Praise The book has also received praise from a number of celebrities and public figures, who have cited it as influential in their lives. Comedian John Cleese said the book was one of the most helpful he had ever read. Musician Thom Yorke said, \\"It's the most extraordinary thing I've ever read\\" and \\"It felt like common sense from start to finish. I guess that's what wisdom is, really.\\" The Spanish footballer Carles ‚ÄúTarzan‚Äù Puyol is said to have taken a keen interest in Tibetan culture and Buddhism after reading The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying which helped him deal with the death of a family member. Influence =Health care= Since The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying was published, it has been adopted by institutions, centres and groups of various kinds, educational, medical and spiritual. Sogyal Rinpoche said in his introduction to the revised edition: In 1993, an international programme of education and training called, Spiritual Care, was established by Christine Longaker and others in response to requests from healthcare professionals for practical ways to bring the compassion and wisdom of teachings in The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying into their work and lives. Over the past 17 years, they have worked with hospitals, hospices and universities, and trained more than 30,000 healthcare professionals and volunteers worldwide in all areas of healthcare and social services, and supported many people facing serious illness, death, or bereavement, and their families.The Spiritual Care Programme Adaptations *Director Stan Lai, in his project with the Dharma Department of the National Institute of Arts, Taiwan, developed a 7-hour drama with as the starting point and central theme, a story that Rinpoche told in the book about \\"Patient Five\\", a woman who tells the story of her life as she faces imminent death.A Broader Canvas *Australian composer Nigel Westlake's son was murdered just before the age of 21.

Life and career Jim Stewart was born in Wales and his family moved to Warwickshire when he was a boy.John Arlott, Arlott on Cricket, Willow Books, London, 1984, pp. 130‚Äì32. He made his first- class debut for Warwickshire in 1955 and played frequently without establishing his place until 1959, when he scored 1799 runs at an average of 40.88 with five centuries. He hit four of those centuries in five innings. Against Lancashire he set a world first-class record by hitting 17 sixes in the match. A tall, powerfully built opening batsman, he was an especially strong driver. He had another successful season in 1960, with 1764 runs at an average of 42.00.

His seven centuries that year included his highest score, when he made 182 not out and 79 not out in the victory over Leicestershire. A broken big toe on his left foot, which led to the toe's amputation, hampered his progress for the next few years, and he was also held back by an operation for arthritis in his right hand. Nevertheless, he still exceeded 1000 runs in 1965 and 1968. After leaving Warwickshire at the end of the 1969 season he played a few matches for Northamptonshire in the John Player League in 1971 and 1972, but with little success. He was also a rugby union player who played at full back in three of the Warwickshire teams that won the rugby union County Championship.

He won the gold medal in the 1500 metres at the 1958 European Championships. Hewson was one of the first men to run a four-minute mile, clocking 3:59.8 at the White City Stadium in London on 28 May 1955. As he placed third to L√°szl√≥ T√°bori and Chris Chataway, he became the first to run a mile in less than four minutes and not finish in the top two; before that race, only Roger Bannister and John Landy had run a four-minute mile.  Early life and education  Hewson was born in Croydon, Surrey. He went to Pollards Hill Junior School, Pollards Hill, London and continued his education at Mitcham Grammar School, Mitcham, London, followed at aged 16 to learn every aspect of tailoring at the Regent Street Polytechnic, London.  Athletics career  = Early running career = Hewson started running whilst attending Mitcham Grammar School. In 1947 he began to run quarter miles and won the Mitcham Schools Championship. Cecil Dale of Mitcham Athletics Club saw this win and as a result awarded Hewson a scholarship to Mitcham A.C.. He was then introduced to Frank Drew one of the club's coaches who then became Hewson's first coach. In his last year as a Youth he ran the 880 in 1:59.4. In his first year as a Junior he won the A.A.A. Junior 880 title in a record time of 1:55.3. = Sub-4-minute mile = Sadly in April 1955 Hewson's coach Frank Drew died. He was then introduced to Austrian coach Franz Stampfl who was already coaching Chris Chataway. At this time Hewson moved up to run the mile. Then on May 28, 1955, at the British Games Meeting in London, he became only the fourth = man in the world to run a four-minute mile, running 3:59.8 the same time achieved by Chris Chatterway in this same race which was won by L√°szl√≥ T√°bori in a time of 3:59.0., but where Hewson was placed third in the race.

In the 1500 metres final Hewson was leading in the final straight, only to be then passed by four men. The race was won by Ron Delany in a time of 3:41.2. Hewson came fifth in a time of 3:42.6. = 1958 = 1958 was Hewson's best season, in addition to winning gold medal in the European Games, he also produced his best times over the half and the mile and their metric equivalent times, which when added to his record performances of previous years made him the fastest-ever Englishman over 880 yards, running a personal best in 1958 of 1:47.0, 1000 metres, 1000 yards and 1500 metres running a personal best in 3:41.1, whilst only Derek Johnson had run faster over 800 metres and Roger Bannister and Derek Ibbotson had run faster over the mile. = 1958 European Athletic Championships Sweden = Hewson won Gold Medal in the Men's 1500 metres at The European Championships in Stockholm on 24 August 1958 in a time of 3:41.9. = 1960 Olympics Rome Italy = Hewson damaged a calf muscle six weeks before the Rome Olympics and so selectors insisted he run the 800 metres. In his qualifying heat he led for 700 metres before being passed by three runners, meaning that he came fourth and so eliminated from the 800 metres final.  Career  Having retired from athletics after the Rome Olympics, Hewson continued working at Simpson's of Piccadilly, London as a tailor, before setting up his own tailoring company in the East End of London. Clothing, sport, fashion and retailing were to shape his working career, where he became women's fashion buyer for English Lady and subsequently sportwear and sporting goods buyer for Debenhams. He then joined the Incentive Group where he was involved in the design and manufacture of corporate uniforms for major UK multi-national companies.  Personal life  Hewson married Roberta E. \\"Bobby\\" Bassford in 1957, but the marriage was annulled on the grounds that she had refused to consummate the marriage. He married Alison Blaiklock, a secretary, in 1963; the couple had three children, James, Caroline and Charles. They divorced in 1980 and Hewson was remarried to Marion Stiff and has four stepchildren Tim, Sally, Robert and Penny.  Publications  = Autobiography = * Flying Feet. Stanley Paul & Co Ltd. 1962.

It was the first of seven generations of this Australian-made model, produced until 2016. Overview The first Falcon sold in Australia was the XK series, which was introduced in September 1960. It was initially offered only as a four-door sedan, in both Falcon and Falcon Deluxe trim levels. The XK was essentially a right-hand drive version of the North American model, although local country dealers often included modifications such as heavy-duty rear suspension (five leaves) and larger 6.50 x 13 tyres. Front seat belts were optional. The steering was light and the ride surprisingly good, on well-paved roads. Whereas the North American model used an 'economy' 3.10:1 rear axle ratio, the Australian Falcon was built with a 3.56:1 ratio which better complemented the torque characteristics of the engine. It had a turning circle. The wagon, added to the range in November 1960, was shortened at the rear due to concern that the back of the car might scrape on rough roads and spoon drains. Billed as being \\"Australian-with a world of difference\\", Falcon offered the first serious alternative to Holden, and became an instant success. Sales were aided by the contemporary FB series Holden being perceived as lacklustre and dated by comparison. Two engines were available; a Falcon Six inline-six, which produced and an optional version of the Falcon Six, which produced . The Falcon was available with either a three- speed column shift manual transmission, or a two-speed Ford-O-Matic automatic transmission. Although the engines were superior to the Holden FB's inline- six, which produced , and the Holden did not offer an automatic gearbox, the Falcon quickly gained a reputation for weak gearboxes and suspension components, and struggled to take much of Holden's marketshare. This was further compounded by the introduction of the new Holden EJ in July 1962. The XK range was expanded in May 1961 with the addition of utility and panel van body styles, officially designated as Falcon Utility and Falcon Sedan Delivery, respectively. As with the wagons, these lacked the extended rear overhang of their American counterparts, and also used the four-door front doors rather than the longer two-door units used by the Ranchero and US sedan delivery. When production of the XK Falcon ended in August 1962, 68,465 units had been sold. The Falcon was also exported in small numbers to the various Empire colonies and Commonwealth nations.

The authority of the accepted description, Rumex palustris, was James Edward Smith, in Fl. Brit. volume 1, on page 394 in 1800. =Subspecies= *Rumex palustris uliginosus *Rumex palustris maritimus Habitat and distribution Rumex palustris can be found in wetlands such as moist meadows, marshes, lake shores and the shallow edges of streams. It is native to Europe and is concentrated in the Southeastern and Middle parts of the continent. The species was also introduced to America; it now grows in California and New Jersey. Uses Rumex palustris is used as a model organism for research. Most studies involve flood-resistance in Rumex palustris due to its unique mechanism to elongate in an effort to outgrow submergence. When flooded, Rumex palustris is able to elongate its petioles in order to emerge from the surface of the water. This mechanism is a beneficial adaptation for Rumex palustris to survive its wetland habitat and is being studied for research on plant stress resistance.

The VT520 is an ANSI standard computer terminal introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1993 and 1994.Paul Williams, Meet the Family, vt100.net, retrieved June 16, 2007 The VT520 is a multi-session monochrome text-only terminal with a built-in 14\\" monitor. The VT510 was a single-session version, while the VT525 added color support and used a separate external monitor. The VT500s replaced all existing models of DEC's VT line, which at that time consisted of just the VT420 text and VT340 graphics terminals. It was introduced in an era when the market was being flooded by low-cost IBM PC clones which could perform the same functions using a terminal emulator while also running other software. DEC introduced the VT500s only a short time before selling off their entire terminal division in August 1995. This brought the VT series to a close, after a total of about six million terminals had been sold. The VT520 was available from Boundless Technologies until the company went defunct in 2003. Description By the mid-1990s the price of low-end PCs was rapidly falling to under $1000. When equipped with a terminal emulator, these machines could perform all the functions of a DEC terminal, as well as running software locally. The terminal market began to crash, but remained important to DEC's core minicomputer business. DEC responded by introducing the VT500 series as simplified and lower-cost options to the existing VT420 and VT340. The new 500s were text- only but they added an RS-232C serial port and a Centronics port as well as a PS/2 keyboard connector which made them easier to integrate into a mixed computing environment. They also had two DEC proprietary MMJ serial connectors and a DEC proprietary keyboard port like their predecessors. The VT510 was introduced in 1993 as an all-in-one unit with a built-in 14\\" display. The VT520 was similar but supported up to 4 sessions using a system known as TD/SMP. The later VT525 color terminal dispensed with the integrated monitor as well, packaging the system into a pizza box case with an SVGA port for connection to an external user-supplied monitor. Like all models of the VT series, the VT500's primary purpose is to act as an ANSI standard terminal. The VT510 supported only a single session, while the 520 and 525 supported up to four sessions, up from two in earlier VTs. The user can flip between the sessions using control sequences on the keyboard (typically ), or display multiple sessions at the same time by splitting the screen horizontally or vertically. All models have multiple character sets in ROM, supporting DEC, international and PC characters. They can also replace any of these by downloading custom characters using sixels, and perform single-character swaps using the National Replacement Character Set, swapping with for use with UK keyboards for instance. The speed of the serial ports was increased to 115.2 kbps, up from 38.4 kbps on the VT300s. Any one of the serial ports could support two sessions using TD/SMP. Like earlier models of the VT line, the 500s could be put into modes emulating the VT100 and VT52, but added a wide variety of other emulations for Wyse, ADDS TeleVideo and other terminals. The 500s also directly supported ANSI commands for color, like the Wyse, in addition to the custom escape sequences used for color support on previous VT models. Another new feature was the inclusion of a set of desk accessories running on the terminal's CPU. These included a calculator, alarm clock, calendar, and a character set viewer. Terminal emulator specifications may refer to VT500 instead of VT510, VT520 and VT525 in the statements about their compatibility.

It features a spiral track, and players race their pieces along the spiral from the outside to the centre and back. The first player to finish wins the hyena, which also travels along the spiral. On the return journey to the outside, the hyena eats any of the players it passes.  Overview  The playing area is traditionally marked on the ground, but may be drawn on paper. It has a sequence of many circles arranged in a spiral, each representing a camp and the end of a day's journey. The first circle at the outside of the spiral is larger and represents a village, and the final circle at the centre of the spiral represents a well at an oasis. Each player owns a piece, representing a mother. The objective of the game is to travel from the village to the well, then be the first player to return to the village. There is also a piece to represent the hyena, which is unleashed by the winning player to jeopardise the return of the other mothers.  Gameplay  All pieces start at the village. The players move their mothers according to the roll of a die (traditionally pieces of stick were used). A player must throw a six to get their mother from the village onto the first circle. A player must throw the exact number to reach the well; if the number thrown is higher than the number of days to the well they must try again on their next turn. Once they reach the well the mother washes her clothes until the player rolls a six again. Then the mother starts the return journey to the village. The first player to get their mother back to the village (an exact throw is not required) wins the game. For added entertainment, the winner is allowed to play the hyena. Again, a six must be thrown to release it from the village. The well must be reached by an exact throw and can only be left when a six is thrown. The hyena moves at twice the speed of the mothers (double the score of the die), and any mothers the hyena passes on the return journey are eaten and removed from the game.

Its population was estimated to be 54,849 in 2005.2005 population estimates for cities in Pakistan Qila Didar Singh lies on the Gujranwala-Hafizabad Road, 17 km west of Gujranwala. The town's rice market is one of the largest in the Punjab. In 2007, Qila Didar Singh was administratively upgraded to City Town, one of four in the Gujranwala District. Affiliated with the University of the Punjab, there are two Govt colleges in town, one each for boys and girls, which offer BA and BSc degrees, among others. Qila Didar Singh is center of education and shopping for nearby villages. There are also many other educational institutions in the town. History The origin of the town is related to a Sikh land owner called Didar Singh. When Didar Singh was married, his father gave him the lands surrounding the part of Qila Didar Singh that is currently known as \\"Old/Inside part of Qila\\". The name Qila implies a fort; this name originates in the fact that Didar Singh's family had a very large and tall mansion, which was surrounded by smaller houses. Because there was a wall surrounding the whole town with several gates, the town had the appearance of a fort. During the Indian rebellion of 1857, British troops during chase of the rebels, arrived at the Qila and surrounded it, believing it to be a fort. Representatives of the townpeople however managed to convince the troops that the town was not in fact a fortification. In 1947, the year of Pakistan's independence from the British Indian Empire, Qila Didar Singh was a very small town with mainly Sikh and Hindu population. Most of the Sikhs and Hindus living in the town moved to the Indian part of the Punjab and many Muslim immigrants moved to the area from the East Punjab, Haryana. Source of income Due to fertile soil of the surrounding area, the economic backbone of Qila Didar Singh is agriculture; the main cash crops being rice in the summer and wheat in winter. Most people from Qila Didar Singh are self employed, have their own business because of very big rice market and lot of customer for other commodities also come from the surrounding villages. There are government employees, private employees and factory workers. There has been considerable migration from the area to other countries. Residents of Qila Didar Singh are not farmers but people living in villages around Qila Didar Singh earn their living from rice and wheat fields. A couple of hundred people from Qila Didar Singh commute to Gujranwala daily for labour or to do technical jobs in various small industries in the city.

Whatever is unusable (e.g. old colouring books or broken toys) is thrown away (into Colin the Dustbin, a 'clutter compactor'). *7. Contestants weigh their remaining items. *8. Whichever contestant has lost the most 'clutter' wins a prize, usually tickets to the theatre, football game or other recreational outing. *9. Both contestants are shown their new rooms which have been redecorated by the presenters - regardless of whether they want it or not. Forfeits include two 5 kg teddy bears which are awarded to the contestants who sells or donates the least amount of clutter Selling Each team must battle it out to raise the most money and avoid the 5 kg teddies.

It is classified as critically endangered, having declined dramatically in the last 60 years due to increased fertiliser and herbicide. Modern farming techniques such as autumn cultivation have also affected the plant because they are killed before they have set seed.

Botanical Society of the British Isles,1980. Ploidy Chromosome number of Scandix pecten-veneris and infraspecific taxa 2n = 16, 26. Scientific name Scandix is in origin a Latin word for chervil used by Pliny the Elder, who was also the first to record the descriptive name pecten Veneris signifying 'Venus's comb'. English names Scandix pecten- veneris has a wealth of evocative common names in English - most of them needle-related, in reference to the distinctive fruit, which, when mature, make it unlikely to be confused with any other native umbellifer. The English folk imagination has made of the plant the 'needle' of the following : Adam, the beggar, the clock, the crow, the Devil, the old wife/old woman/witch, Puck, the shepherd, and (more prosaically) the tailor. Of these, the tailor is (self-evidently) a user of needles in his work; Adam, the beggar, the crow and the shepherd convey rustic simplicity; the clock draws a parallel with clock hands and 'needles', and the Devil, the Witch and Puck play on the idea of the (malignly) supernatural and uncanny. English 'comb' names for the plant are less plentiful, one, of the two recorded, invoking (once again) the shepherd and the other relating to the lady i.e. 'Our Lady' ‚Äî one of the titles of the Virgin Mary. '(Our) Lady's Comb' is thus a Christianised form of 'Venus's Comb' (first recorded by Pliny in the Latin form pecten Veneris) with the name of the preeminent female figure of the newer religion replacing the name of the Roman goddess. The connection between a harmless, edible plant growing in a cornfield and somewhat sinister supernatural entities (to say nothing of an ancient Roman goddess) is not immediately apparent to the modern mind, but may be explained by a study of ancient harvest customs. When growing corn waves in the wind, a shiver appears to run through it; and this was often described (by pre-industrial populations) as some imaginary creature running through the field. This supernatural 'creature' could be identified with the last sheaf cut at harvest time, as could certain female entities, preserving traces of half-remembered, pre-Christian goddesses. The association of grain with a goddess could be as old as the first attempts at sowing seed and collecting plants that were useful for food, and the grain field as a human-made environment in the British Isles and Ireland dates from the Neolithic period, with its attendant mythology (surviving only as iconography) colouring later Celtic myth.The Language of the Goddess, Gimbutas, Marija, pub. Thames and Hudson 1989 In this context, the Old Wife/Old Woman/Witch names for Scandix pecten-veneris can be seen to refer to a harvest goddess of the kind still remembered in Celtic countries and present in English folk belief as part of a Celtic substrate pre-dating the Saxon invasions. The folkloric entity known as the 'Old Wife' can thus be understood in relation to the Welsh Gwrach, the Northern English and Lowland Scots Carlin and the Scottish Highland and Irish Cailleach. Puck and the Devil in names for the plant can likewise be understood as conceptions of the uncanny corn spirit whose passage is marked by the waving of the wheat in the wind, the Devil being a Christian interpretation of an earlier Puck figure.Hilda Ellis Davidson. Roles of the Northern Goddess. Routledge, 1998. Chapter II (page 52): 'Mistress of the Grain'. See also p.155 re. Venus/Our Lady plant names. Distribution Scandix pecten-veneris has a range extending from Western, Central and Southern Europe Eastwards to Western and Central Asia and is found also in the Maghreb. Within the U.K. the plant used to be widely distributed as a weed of arable land in the Southeast of England, being found as far west as Wiltshire, but became rather rare in its former haunts, a state of affairs attributed to stubble-burning and the use of modern herbicidesStreeter, David The Wildflowers of the British Isles illustrated by Garrard, Ian, pub. Midsummer Books Ltd. 1983. This gloomy tale of decline was, however, qualified in 1996 by wild food enthusiast Richard Mabey, who noted that, although the plant had suffered a dramatic decline in England, beginning in the 1950s, it began to recover with the banning of stubble-burning in the early 1990s. Furthermore ‚Äî and contrary to earlier theories ‚Äî the plant has proven to be resistant to modern herbicides after all and Mabey notes that the 'needles' of the plant are not readily separated from wheat by modern harvesting machinery ‚Äî another factor contributing to its return to the English countryside.Richard Mabey. Flora Britannica. Sinclair-Stevenson, 1996. Habitat Scandix pecten-veneris is a ruderal species, tending to favour dry, calcareous soils and often occurring in open meadows and woodland edges, this species does well in arable land and was formerly cultivated as a vegetable, as well as being gathered from the wild (see below). As an edible plant Scandix pecten-veneris has a long history of use in Europe, both as a leaf vegetable and as a salad vegetable. Some of the earliest references to its consumption are to be found in Ancient Greek texts satirising the tragedian Euripides (c.480-c.406 B.C.), of Salamis Island, which portray the playwright's mother, Cleito, as a humble greengrocer,Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in A Companion to Greek Tragedy, Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), page 252 amongst whose wares was the vegetable scanthrix - the name of which found its way into Latin, in the modified form scandix, as a name for chervil (a related, edible umbellifer). The edible plant scanthrix is mentioned also by the Ancient Greek writers Opion, Theophrastus, and Erasistratus of Ceos, while the variant form of the name scanthrox is used by Pedanius Dioscorides for the same plant. Among Latin authors, Pliny the Elder lists scandix among the edible plants of Egypt. Much later, the Vicentine physician Onorio Belli (a.k.a. Honorius Bellus, 1550-1604) notes that, in his day, it was eaten on the island of Crete.E.L. Sturtevant. Sturtevant's Notes on Edible Plants, pub. J.P.

The campaign called for an irregular and extraordinary (one-off and one-time-only) general amnesty, regularisation, naturalisation and British citizenship for illegal immigrants in the United Kingdom. The campaign became defunct in 2013. The campaign was founded by Austen Ivereigh, a former director of public affairs for the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, and as such had strong links with amongst others the Cardinal Archbishop, Westminster Cathedral, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales and the Catholic Herald newspaper, all three being supporters of the political advocacy campaign. The campaign attempted to influence the policies of the political parties and candidates in both the 2008 London mayoral election and in the 2010 general election in the United Kingdom During the London mayoral election, the campaign was supportively endorsed by the Liberal Democrats and the Labour and Conservative candidates for the Mayoralty of London in their personal capacity, being Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson respectively. Prelude When it was launched in February 2007 with the backing of church leaders, trade unions and migrant support groups, the campaign made rapid political progress, later counting the Conservative mayor of London and the Liberal-Democrat party among its principal advocates. Background data The Home Office calculated there to be at least 500,000 refused asylum-seekers and visa overstayers who have made new lives in the UK, and admits that most will never be expelled. But these estimates, based on 2001 figures, have been superseded by a study by the London School of Economics (LSE) which suggests that \\"the current population of irregular migrants and their children in the UK is somewhere in the range of 525,000 to 950,000 with a central estimate of 725,000\\". At current removal rates and costs, this means it would take 34 years and cost ¬£8 billion forcibly to remove them all. Recently, a study carried out by the University of Oxford has estimated that there are 120,000 irregular migrant children in the UK, of whom 65,000 born in the UK to parents without legal immigration status. Strangers into Citizens argues that a proportion of these should become legal by means of a two-year work permit available to asylum-seekers or economic migrants who can show they have been in the UK for four years or more. The proposals put forward by the campaign would give indefinite leave to remain at the end of a two-year period, subject to criteria such as an English language test, a clean criminal record and valid references from an employer and community sponsor for those qualifying for a work permit. Campaigners describe this as a \\"pathway to citizenship\\" of the sort advocated by President Barack Obama. In Europe, they point to the Spanish amnesty of 2005, in which 700,000 were granted legal status, as a possible model for the UK. Strangers into Citizens Campaign Photo by Alban Bytyqi, Social movement organizer Strangers into Citizens Campaign Photo by Alban Bytyqi, Social movement organizer Endorsements The campaign was inspired by a call by the Archbishop of Westminster Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, who first raised the possibility at a Mass for Migrant Workers on 1 May 2006, organised by London Citizens.Cardinal suggests UK amnesty for illegal immigrants  Ekklesia The Cardinal was moved to make the call following representations by Catholic priests concerned at the welfare of some of their congregants who either faced destitution or were paid less than the London Living Wage (LLW). London Citizens was also concerned that the LLW, for which they had long campaigned, was being undermined by employers exploiting illegal immigrants. The Cardinal's call was taken up by faith leaders across the UK, as well as by the then Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone., trade unions, migrant and refugee organisations, as well as policy think tanks from all sides of the political spectrum, among them Compas and the Institute of Public Policy Research as well as politicians in both Houses of Parliament. In 2007 dozens of MPs in all the main parties signed an Early Day Motion in favour of the proposal. Strangers into Citizens was supported by three out of six of the candidates to the deputy leadership of the Labour Party., including the winner of that contest, Harriet Harman, who is married to the campaign's leading trade union advocate Jack Dromey A poll commissioned by the campaign shows most British people back the idea of giving status to those who have been living and working in the UK for many years.Refugee Council  April  Two thirds of British people think asylum seekers should be allowed to work Strangers into Citizens is supported by the major migrant NGOs in the UK (among them the Immigration Advisory Service, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Refugee Action, the Migrant Rights Network, the Jesuit Refugee Service and the Churches' Refugee Forum). The campaign's proposals have been supported by editorials in The Independent, The Tablet and The Universe, and advocated in articles published in the Guardian, the Daily Telegraph, The Voice, the Observer, the Spectator, and the Evening Standard. The campaign has been strongly attacked in the Daily Express and the Sun. Rally in Trafalgar Square, May 2007 On 7 May 2007 15,000 people gathered in the rain in Trafalgar Square to call for regularisation. Among those addressing the Strangers into Citizens call were the (Catholic) Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor; the (Anglican) Bishop of Southwark, Tom Butler; Dr Mohammed Bari of the Muslim Council of Britain; Rabbi Shissler (representing the Chief Rabbi); Baroness Williams of Crosby; Jon Cruddas, the MP for Dagenham; Jack Dromey, deputy secretary- general of the TGWU; Dave Prentis, head of UNISON; the singer Billy Bragg; as well as the campaign's co-ordinator, Dr Austen Ivereigh. On 20 June 2007 the proposal was debated in the House of Commons. Progress of the campaign In June 2006, the Institute for Public Policy Research applauded the apparent openness by Liam Byrne, the immigration minister, to the idea, following the Institute's study of the benefits of regularisation to the UK. IPPR calculated that ¬£4.7 billion would be needed to be spent to deport all illegal residents, whereas the extra tax revenues from regularisation would result in a ¬£1bn bonanza to the Exchequer in unpaid taxes. By regularising the most eligible, IPPR argued, the enforcement effort on the remainder can be reduced by at least half, perhaps even by as much as three-quarters or more. Currently, the Home Office repatriates up to 25,000 illegal immigrants a year, and has openly admitted it does not have the resources to remove all illegals in the country. On 19 February 2007, the immigration minister rejected the idea, saying \\"it would act as a pull factor in drawing illegal immigrants to this country.\\" However, a Spanish expert on the issue told the BBC Today Programme on 7 May that the Spanish regularisation of 700,000 migrants in 2005 had reduced the numbers of illegal immigrants. A Council of Europe report in February 2007 argues that regularisation should be seen as part of a package of immigration reforms which reduce illegal immigration. Through measures that aim to crack down on the informal economy, cut down on impractical bureaucracy, and give immigrants a legal option for admission, Spain hopes to better control unauthorised immigration. A BBC report in June 2006 found that the Spanish regularisation had been a success, and that most Spaniards believed it had worked. Strangers into Citizens believes the Spanish model could provide a way forward for the UK. Endorsement by the Liberal Democrats The campaign scored its first major success in August 2007, when following meetings with campaigners the Liberal Democrats announced it would be consider adopting the proposal at its party conference. Its immigration minister, Nick Clegg MP, argued in The Observer that \\"a route of earned legalisation should be made available to those who have lived here unauthorised for many years\\", and promised to \\"set stringent criteria ‚Äì this is not a blanket amnesty\\". Among the criteria were * that the applicant should have lived in the UK for many years; * should have a clean criminal record; and * should show a long-term commitment to the UK. Clegg also said the applicant would be subject to a public interest test and an English language and civics test, and would be required to pay a charge. \\"Frankly this is just in recognition of the fact that, because of incompetence or mismanagement in the immigration system over many years, we have very large numbers of people who live in this twilight world of illegality and ‚Äì in many cases ‚Äì exploitation in the workplace which we need to deal with,\\" Mr Clegg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The Government repeated its opposition to the idea, while the Conservative Party's David Davis attacked the idea as \\"irresponsible\\": \\"on the one hand it will encourage people to come here illegally as well as being unfair to those who have obeyed the law and tried to enter the UK legally.\\". On 18 September 2007, the Liberal-Democrats adopted the idea of \\"an earned route to citizenship\\" with 10 years' residence conditions. Although the residence requirement was too strict, Strangers into Citizens campaigners said they were \\"delighted that a major political party has adopted a specific policy of regularisation\\". At the Labour Party conference in Bournemouth on 24 September 2007, Jon Cruddas, the leading parliamentary advocate of the campaign, criticised immigration minister Liam Byrne's objections. \\"There's a fork in the road on this issue\\", he said at a fringe meeting organised by the Immigration Advisory Service and Strangers into Citizens campaign. London mayoral candidates' endorsement, 2008 A major advance for the campaign came in the run-up to the London mayoralty election on 1 May 2008. At a public assembly organised by London Citizens on 9 April 2008, the four leading mayoral candidates all agreed to brand London a \\"Strangers into Citizens\\" capital, and to throw their weight behind the campaign. The backing of the Labour and Conservative candidates was in defiance of their national party policies. Quizzed about Boris Johnson's stance in advance of the assembly, the Conservative Party leader, David Cameron, disagreed with him, but acknowledged that he was not bound by central party policy. At the Assembly itself, Johnson expressed pride in his Muslim immigrant ancestry, saying that his Turkish great-grandfather who had fled from Turkey would be proud to have a descendant standing for mayor.. \\"If an immigrant has been here for a long time and there is no realistic prospect of returning them, then I do think that person's condition should be regularised so that they can pay taxes and join the rest of society,\\" Boris Johnson told the 2,500-strong assembly. Despite a Sunday Times report after the election the mayor had \\"quietly dropped\\" his commitment, Johnson has since become the campaign's highest-profile advocate. Endorsement by the Catholic bishops of England and Wales In March 2007, Vincent Nichols, the then Archbishop of Birmingham, added his support for the campaign proposals at a Birmingham Citizens assembly. In April 2008, the Catholic bishops of England and Wales issued a major policy document, \\"Mission of the Church to migrants in England and Wales\\", which included a call for regularisation, without specifying conditions. Noting that \\"many [undocumented] migrants have been here for several years; some have even set down roots and started families\\", the bishops said: \\"Without condoning illegal immigration, the Church's position on this, as in other fields of human endeavour, does not allow economic, social and political calculations to prevail over the person, but on the contrary, for the dignity of the human person to be put above everything else, and the rest to be conditioned by it. The Church will continue to advocate compassion to allow the 'undocumented' an opportunity to acquire proper status, so that they can continue to contribute to the common good without the constant fear of discovery and removal.\\" Speaking at the third Mass for Migrant Workers at Westminster Cathedral in London, on 5 May 2008, the Bishop of Brentwood, Thomas McMahon, pledged support for Strangers into Citizens and described as \\"shameful\\" and \\"unjust\\" the Government's failure to regularise the position of thousands of long-term illegal immigrants in Britain. The bishop called on Catholics to remain \\"resolute\\" and \\"steadfast\\" in backing the campaign proposal. \\"For any Government to choose to do nothing about regularisation is irresponsible and leaves countless migrants vulnerable to exploitation and living in fear and in limbo,\\" Bishop McMahon told the congregation. \\"They cannot work, they cannot claim benefit, they cannot get public housing. I can only describe it as shameful and unjust.\\" The bishop added that there would be another rally in Trafalgar Square on May Bank Holiday in 2009 \\"to demonstrate to the Government that this issue has not gone away\\". An idea gaining momentum? Starting in 2007, the UK Border Agency (formerly the Border and Immigration Agency and, previously, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate of the Home Office) began an attempt to clear the backlog of unresolved asylum cases. Although not officially an amnesty but a 'case resolution exercise', this has led to a number of asylum-seeking families whose applications had been refused being granted Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK. Because this legal recognition was given on the basis of their \\"long association with the UK\\", according to wording of the letters that these families have received, it has obvious points in common with the Strangers into Citizens campaign, and may well have been influenced by it. In July 2008, the liberal policy thinktank Centre Forum published a policy paper whose title ‚Äì \\"Earned amnesty: bringing illegal workers out of the shadows\\"‚Äîborrowed heavily from the Strangers into Citizens campaign's language and concepts. But while many of the arguments were the same, Centre Forum proposed that immigrants pay their way into British citizenship, spending ¬£5,000 over a period of years, and requiring a residence of just three months. In September 2008 The Independent reported that Anthony Browne, director of the Conservative policy thinktank Policy Exchange who is soon to start as the Mayor of London's policy director, would be releasing a policy document favouring regularisation. In a comment piece in the newspaper, Browne argued for a \\"permanent earned amnesty for those who have been in the country a long time\\", halving the current long residency concession of 14 to seven years before reducing it still further. The new Labour Immigration Minister Phil Woolas told The Times that \\"An amnesty... starts with a discussion among politicians and ends with dead bodies in the back of a truck in Calais.\\" Boris gives explicit support In October 2008, the London Assembly passed a motion backing the Mayor's support for an amnesty for long-term migrants and called on the Government to implement it. The following month, London's Conservative mayor, Boris Johnson, gave an interview to Channel 4 News endorsing the idea in terms almost identical to the Strangers into Citizens proposals. He said the expulsion of London's 400,000 illegal immigrants was \\"just not going to happen\\". While he was powerless to change national policy on the issue, Johnson said he wanted to \\"lead the debate\\" by commissioning a study into the feasibility of the idea. He said he favoured the idea of an \\"earned amnesty\\", whereby after a period of about five years individuals could \\"show their commitment to this society and to this economy\\" to earn the right to stay. \\"We want to look in detail at what the economic impact of such an earned amnesty system would be,\\" he said. Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor repeated his support for the idea, backing mayor Boris on the BBC Sunday programme. In November 2008 the mayor announced he had commissioned a study from the London School of Economics. On 9 March 2009, a BBC Panorama programme included some findings from the LSE's interim report which showed that the undocumented population of the UK had increased to around 725,000, and that it would take 34 years and cost ¬£8bn forcibly to remove them. The report estimated that around 70 per cent of the UK total lived in London, and that 450,000 would be regularised under the mayor's proposal. Strangers into Citizens welcomed the revised figures as more realistic. \\"We have consistently said that the Home Office figures were too low and that 700‚Äì800,000 was more realistic, said its policy director, Dr Austen Ivereigh. \\"We welcome confirmation of the reality by a leading research institution. We can now have more realistic discussion about what to do.\\" \\"If it was completely impossible back then to claim that deportation was a solution, it is even more impossible in the light of the new figures,\\" he added. The mayor told 'Panorama': \\"If it does look as though they could make a contribution to society, we should regularise their status or offer them the chance of regularising their status. There would be some very tough criteria. Obviously no criminal record would be one, an ability to support yourself and support your family, commitment to society and the most, the most important thing is they should have been here for a considerable period of time.\\" Mr Johnson said it was a \\"hard political argument to win\\" but added: \\"If people are going to be here and we've chronically failed to kick them out it's morally right that they should contribute in their taxes to the rest of society.\\" BBC Panorama examines the issue \\"Immigration ‚Äì time for an amnesty?\\", examined the mayor's proposal, but without referring to the Strangers into Citizens campaign which had led to it. It featured profiles of undocumented migrants, including a Brazilian mother of two who came to the UK seven years ago with the specific intention of overstaying her visitor's visa. She earned ¬£8 an hour cleaning people's houses ‚Äì all cash in hand, no taxes. If she were regularised and allowed to pay tax, she would contribute to the economy, but would get access to benefits such as healthcare and education. In Maria's case it would mean that her five-year-old son, who was born in the UK, could go to school instead of accompanying her on cleaning job; at present the boy is missing out on his education because Maria is worried they would get deported if her illegal status is discovered. The programme also profiled Maria's eldest son, born in Brazil, who came over on a student visa which expired three years earlier. He worked as a washer of dishes in a restaurant kitchen 60 hours a week, earning less than the minimum wage. Because he is illegal, he can do nothing about it. The programme also examined the case of a 28-year-old Bangladeshi teacher, Farhan Zakaria, who has been in the UK for 12 years and considers himself British. He had become illegal without knowing it when his father lost his job at the High Commission. The school where he taught French was forced to sack him; replacing him had proved difficult and costly. Panorama included comments by Phil Woolas, the immigration minister, and Sir Andrew Green of MigrationWatch, who repeated their opposition to the idea. The LSE study: interim findings In March 2009 the LSE published the interim findings of a report commissioned by the Greater London Authority (GLA) to explore the proposition of an earned regularisation scheme. It noted three categories of irregular migrant: * illegal entrants ‚Äì those who evade formal migration controls and present false papers (the minority); * migrants who entered legally and have been lawfully present in the UK but whose remain after the end of the agreed period (the overwhelming majority); * children born in the UK to irregular migrants, who are not migrants themselves but have no right to remain. The second category, into which the majority falls, includes two main subcategories: * failed asylum seekers who stay in the UK despite a final decision refusing them the right to remain, and, * overstayers whose period of legal residency has expired without renewal. This second group also includes those who are no longer eligible to stay because of the Government's introduction of a points system. The report noted that eligibility for regularisation programmes varies greatly between countries, and that proportions of the irregular population accepted for such programmes were mostly in the range of 60 to 90 per cent. A \\"very preliminary note\\" on the costs of regularisation noted that there were costs associated with regularisation which arose from the increased use of services (schools, education, health, housing, welfare benefits etc.). But the LSE noted that the extent of use would vary widely and in some cases make little or no impact. The report also observes that there are economic benefits from reducing the size of irregularity which have not yet been addressed.

The tunnel crosses under the Liverpool Range near its east end, below Nowlands Gap (otherwise known as Murrurundi Gap), the crossing used by the New England Highway, and provides a vital link between Newcastle and Werris Creek. The tunnel was completed in 1877 and is owned by the Transport Asset Holding Entity, a state-owned corporation of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Description The tunnel is long, and is approached on either side by climbs at the ruling grade of 1 in 40 (2.5%). The single track tunnel, the oldest of its type in use in New South Wales, when combined with the steep grades, make this section of the Main North rail line a rail bottleneck. Construction of the tunnel was commenced by boring from both ends. The new line from Murrurundi had been finished up to the east of the tunnel to aid in the supply of materials, and the two bores had met with the tunnel navigable by foot. By June 1876 the tunnel was enlarged and brick lined with track laid. The contractors engine made it through the tunnel by July 1876. The line to Quirindi was opened in August 1877. = Fumes = The Ardglen Tunnel is at the summit of ruling grades, and because of its narrow profile, it created fume problems during steam days. Larger locomotives, such as the 60-class Garratt, were either prohibited or limited in load. Fortunately most heavy trains went through the tunnel in the downhill direction, towards Sydney and Newcastle. ARTC Curve and Gradient chart shows the tunnel as being level. Sydney and Newcastle are to the left. = Proposed deviations = To cope with considerably increased coal traffic from north of the tunnel from 2010 and beyond, various deviations are proposed. These deviations can either keep the existing summit tunnel, or bore a much longer tunnel at a lower elevation. The deviations that keep the existing tunnel increase the length of the line so as to ease the gradient to 1 in 80 which is the ruling gradient on the rest of the line to the port. The existing line would be retained for empty trains going the other way, so forming double track. = Stations = The stations on either side of Ardglen Tunnel from the south are: * Murrurundi ‚Äî medium length crossing loop and start of ruling grades. Had a locomotive depot for bank engines in steam days * Pangela ‚Äî closed short crossing loop on ruling gradient * Ardglen Tunnel ‚Äî summit * Ardglen ‚Äî medium length crossing loop and railway station, being further lengthened in 2010 * Kankool ‚Äî short crossing loop on ruling gradient * Willow Tree ‚Äî medium length crossing loop and railway station and end of ruling grades  Heritage listing  Ardglen tunnel is of high significance as the oldest single line tunnel in use in the State and as one of the very few remaining single line tunnels in use. It is also an important landscape element at the head of the ridge which is approached by steep grades in both directions. Ardglen Tunnel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare. This item is assessed as scientifically rare. This item is assessed as archeologically rare. This item is assessed as socially rare.

It was the third iteration of the first generation of the Australian-made Ford Falcon. Overview The XM series Falcon range was introduced in February 1964, as a replacement for the XL series Falcon. The XM featured around 1,500 modifications from the XL, including numerous changes to the suspension which now featured stronger ball joints, new front upper wishbones, coil-over shock units and relocated rear spring-hangers. Also new were bigger axle shafts and tougher engine mounts. The vacuum operated windscreen wipers of the XL series were replaced by a two- speed electric motor unit and the seats were stronger with better quality upholstery. Unlike previous Australian Falcons, the XM represented a significant departure from the contemporary US Ford Falcon models in terms of exterior styling. Both of the engines from the XK and XL Falcons were retained, albeit with a small power increase for both engines; a Falcon Six inline-six, which produced and an optional version of the Falcon Six, which produced . For higher specification models, such as the Deluxe trim, a version of the Falcon Six was available for the first time (often referred to as the Super Pursuit engine), and produced .

He rose to fame after winning the eighth series of reality series Big Brother. Since then, he has become an internet columnist for entertainment magazine, Heat magazine, as well as a TV segment entertainer for Harry Hill's TV Burp and Big Brother's Big Mouth. Career = Big Brother = Belo entered the Big Brother house on 15 June 2007. He was noted for his apparent ignorance with regard to William Shakespeare, claiming that he had never heard of the playwright. Belo was announced as the winner of the series on 31 August 2007, with 60% of the vote to win. Until 2018, Belo was the youngest winner of the series. =Post Big Brother= Within a month of leaving Big Brother, Belo made his stage debut as the Guardian Angel in The Vegemite Tales opposite Jonathon Dutton and Blair McDonough at The Venue off Leicester Square. Belo then made a cameo appearance a 2007 episode of Hollyoaks; he expressed his enjoyment of the series whilst in Big Brother. Belo later became a regular on the ITV comedy show Harry Hill's TV Burp, where he gives his thoughts on the week's television. Along with Harry, he sings, \\"Ebony. And Ivory. Side by side by the piano keyboard. Oh Lord, why don't we . . . \\", and Harry sprayed him with a stinger. Belo returned to the Big Brother franchise when making a brief appearance in E4's Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack, in which Chris Moyles sent him into the house to surprise the housemates. Belo performed segments of Shakespeare's plays as part of Stratford-upon-Avon's Shakespeare Aloud initiative in March 2008 in order to bring the works to a wider audience. In July 2008, he released a single, entitled Essex Boy, which failed to chart. In October 2008, Belo appeared in TV horror series Dead Set, both as himself and as a zombie. From June 2009 onwards, Belo became a columnist for Heat Magazine's website, documenting the events of the tenth series of Big Brother and he also featured regularly on Big Brother's Big Mouth. In order to commemorate the tenth year of Big Brother, Belo temporarily returned to the house in July 2009 to participate in a task alongside Charlie Drummond. In October 2010, Belo appeared on Gayle Tuesday: The Comeback. =Big Brother 16= In June 2015, Belo returned to Big Brother as part of a \\"Time Warp\\" twist. He was sent in with other former housemates; Big Brother 15 winner Helen Wood and Big Brother 7 finalist Nikki Grahame. They all later entered the Main House on Day 34. Belo's stay in the House was surrounded in controversy, mainly due to the heated arguments between him and fellow guest, Wood. He voluntarily left on 23 June 2015 (Day 43) by climbing out of the House after an argument with Wood.

It was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, St. James, and the Holy Cross. History The convent's first prioress was Lucy (or Lucia), named in a well-preserved, early thirteenth- century bede in which she is called the foundress of the priory, leading to much confusion, as it was assumed that she was a wife of the founder or a member of the Vere family.Victoria County History, Essex, II, 122. The convent was torched by the men of the founder's son and heir late in 1190 or early in 1191, and in punishment Aubrey IV was fined 100 marcs by the king and in atonement donated additional property to the priory in February 1191.William Dugdale, 'Monasticon Anglicanum, IV, 437-8, num.

It was the fourth and last iteration of the first generation of this Australian-made model, and also included the Ford Fairmont (XP), the luxury- oriented version of the Falcon. Introduction The XP Falcon was introduced in March 1965,AC Bushby, The Australian Falcon Collection, 1989, page 62 replacing the XM Falcon which had been in production since 1964. It was the final series of the first-generation Falcon which had been introduced as the XK Falcon in 1960. The main change from the XM was the 'torque box' steel subframe which added structural rigidity to the car. This was a key in improving the public perception of the car, as the early models were considered flimsy and were unpopular with Australian fleet buyers. The running gear and most other components stayed the same from the XM through to the XP. All of the utility, sedan delivery, and taxi/police kit vehicles had five-lug 13-inch wheels and larger 10-inch drum brakes, as had all previous commercial models. Commercials had always had lower-ratio differentials (4.00:1) and larger 6.70 x 13 tyres. The high-end Fairmonts, which were released by Ford Australia as a means of competing with Holdens Premier came with 14-inch four- lug wheels to accommodate the standard disc brakes on this model, whereas other models had 13-inch wheels if disc brakes were not optioned. Both Fairmonts and Futuras (including Futura hardtops) featured bucket seats, however only the Futura models had a center console, The 200 ci Super Pursuit engine initially in four-main bearing form and finally with the imported seven-main bearing unit, three-speed automatic transmission, and a padded dash along with carpets, perforated, colour-matched headlining, blower heater, screen washers, chrome-plated interior mirror, seven interior door-operated lights, and a handbrake on warning light flasher as standard. Vacuum-assisted disc brakes were standard in the Fairmont only and optional on other sedan and hardtop models. The XP Falcon shared the same front panels (bonnet and front guards) as the 1960-63 Mercury Comet.

Finsbury Park should not be confused with Finsbury, which is a district of Central London roughly three miles to the south, forming the south-eastern part of the London Borough of Islington. Geography The area is centred on Finsbury Park station, a major bus, rail and tube interchange near the southern end of the public park of the same name. The neighbourhood includes part of Finsbury Park and Highbury West wards within the London Borough of Islington,Islington Ward Map oncycleislington.uk (accessed June 2018) part of Brownswood ward in the London Borough of Hackney,Hackney Wards map on hackney.gov.uk (accessed June 2018) part of Stroud Green Ward and a very small part of Harringay ward in the London Borough of Haringey.Ward boundaries classify the park as being within Harringay Ward - Haringey Council Map showing the ward boundaries. Locale The area is distinctly cosmopolitan and urban, as reflected by the variety of shops and establishments on Seven Sisters Road, Blackstock Road and Stroud Green Road. The North London Central Mosque (also known as the Finsbury Park Mosque) is located here. Arsenal Football Club's Emirates Stadium is nearby. Demographics The centre of Finsbury Park has a larger than average immigrant population with a lower level of residents born in the UK than the national average and a higher rate of residents either born in other EU countries or outside the EU. This composition is probably not fully representative of the whole neighbourhood. =Demographic history= Scottish and Welsh Presbyterian churches reflect patterns of immigration into London from other regions of the United Kingdom. Welsh-language poet Dewi Emrys and Timothy Eynon Davies were among those who ministered in the district in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The 1960s and 1970s saw a large influx of Bangladeshis alongside pockets of Pakistanis, Indians and Burmese who settled in the borough. Many moved to surrounding locales as their economic prowess grew in the 1980s. They made significant contributions to local business and politics as well as to religious institutions (e.g. the founding of the original Finsbury Park Mosque. A number of immigrant-led businesses opened on Blackstock Road, an area associated with the Algerian immigrant community amongst others. There had been a large minority of the African Caribbean diaspora arriving in the area bordering Manor House throughout the same period and as early as the Windrush generation. Greek Cypriots and later Turkish Cypriots started to arrive in the 1960s and 70s as economic migrants firmly establishing themselves in business through the clothing trade on Fonthill Road. In the 1980s and 90s, immigrants included significant populations of Somalis populating the area as refugees and asylum seekers at the height of the crisis in their homeland and more recent arrivals of settled EU nationals from Scandinavian countries. The top of Blackstock Road is colloquially called \\"little Algiers\\" because of the large North African presence in the area.

Pre-silicon process During the pre- silicon process, engineers test devices in a virtual environment with sophisticated simulation, emulation, and formal verification tools. In contrast, post-silicon validation tests occur on actual devices running at- speed in commercial, real-world system boards using logic analyzer and assertion-based tools. Reasoning Large semiconductor companies spend millions creating new components; these are the \\"sunk costs\\" of design implementation. Consequently, it is imperative that the new chip function in full and perfect compliance to its specification, and be delivered to the market within tight consumer windows. Even a delay of a few weeks can cost tens of millions of dollars. Post-silicon validation is therefore one of the most highly leveraged steps in successful design implementation. Validation Chips comprising 500,000 logic elements are the silicon brains inside cell phones, MP3 players, computer printers and peripherals, digital television sets, medical imaging systems, components used in transportation safety and comfort, and even building management systems. Either because of their broad consumer proliferation, or because of their mission-critical application, the manufacturer must be absolutely certain that the device is thoroughly validated. The best way to achieve high confidence is to leverage the pre-silicon verification work ‚Äî which can comprise as much as 30% of the overall cost of the implementation ‚Äî and use that knowledge in the post- silicon system. Today, much of this work is done manually, which partially explains the high costs associated with system validation. However, there are some tools that have been recently introduced to automate post-silicon system validation. Observability Simulation-based design environments enjoy the tremendous advantage of nearly perfect observability, meaning the designer can see any signal at nearly any time. They suffer, however, from the restricted amount of data they can generate during post-silicon system validation. Many complicated devices indicate their problems only after days or weeks of testing, and they produce a volume of data that would take centuries to reproduce on a simulator. FPGA-based emulators, a well-established part of most implementation techniques, are faster than software simulators but will not deliver the comprehensive at-system-speed tests needed for device reliability. Moreover, the problem of post-silicon validation is getting worse, as design complexity increases because of the terrific advances in semiconductor materials processing. The duration from prototype silicon ‚Äî so- called \\"first silicon\\" ‚Äî to volume production is increasing, and bugs do escape to the customers. The expense associated with IP-hardening is increasing. The industry today is focused on techniques that allow designers to better amortize their investment in pre-silicon verification to post- silicon validation. The best of these solutions enable affordable, scalable, automated, on-chip wire-scale visibility. Benefits Post-silicon validation encompasses all that validation effort that is poured onto a system after the first few silicon prototypes become available, but before product release. While in the past most of this effort was dedicated to validating electrical aspects of the design, or diagnosing systematic manufacturing defects, today a growing portion of the effort focuses on functional system validation. This trend is for the most part due to the increasing complexity of digital systems, which limits the verification coverage provided by traditional pre- silicon methodologies. As a result, a number of functional bugs survive into manufactured silicon, and it is the job of post-silicon validation to detect and diagnose them so that they do not escape into the released system. The bugs in this category are often system-level bugs and rare corner-case situations buried deep in the design state space: since these problems encompass many design modules, they are difficult to identify with pre-silicon tools, characterized by limited scalability and performance. Post-silicon validation, on the other hand, benefits from very high raw performance, since tests are executed directly on manufactured silicon. At the same time, it poses several challenges to traditional validation methodologies, because of the limited internal observability and difficulty of applying modifications to manufactured silicon chips. These two factors lead in turn to critical challenges in error diagnosis and correction.

Jainism does not support belief in a creator deity. All the constituents and actions are governed by universal natural laws. It is not possible to create matter out of nothing and hence the sum total of matter in the universe remains the same (similar to law of conservation of mass). Jain texts claim that the universe consists of jiva (life force or souls) and ajiva (lifeless objects). The soul of each living being is unique and uncreated and has existed during beginningless time.Nayanar (2005b), p.190, GƒÅthƒÅ 10.310 The Jain theory of causation holds that a cause and its effect are always identical in nature and hence a conscious and immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Furthermore, according to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its karmas and desires achieves liberation (nirvana). A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the cosmos: a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas. Through the ages, Jain philosophers have rejected and opposed the concept of any omnipotent creator god, and this has resulted in Jainism being labeled as nastika darsana, or an atheist philosophy by the rival religious philosophies. The theme of non- creationism and absence of omnipotent God and divine grace runs strongly in all the philosophical dimensions of Jainism, including its cosmology, karma, moksa and its moral code of conduct. Jainism asserts a religious and virtuous life is possible without the idea of a creator god. Jaina conception of the Universe Representation of the Universe in Jain cosmology in form of a lokapurusa or cosmic man. Structure of Universe as per the Jain Scriptures. Jain scriptures reject God as the creator of the universe. Jainism offers an elaborate cosmology, including heavenly beings/devas. These heavenly beings are not viewed as creators, they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and must eventually die. If godliness is defined as the state of having freed one's soul from karmas and the attainment of enlightenment/Nirvana and a god as one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods/Tirthankara. Thus, Mahavira was a god/Tirthankara. According to Jains, this loka or universe is an entity, always existing in varying forms with no beginning or end. Jain texts describe the shape of the universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arms resting on his waist. Thus, the universe is narrow at the top, widens above the middle, narrows towards the middle, and once again becomes broad at the bottom.Gopani (1989), GƒÅthƒÅ 4.103‚Äì6 =Wheel of time= Jain Cosmic Wheel of Time According to Jainism, time is beginningless and eternal. The cosmic wheel of time rotates ceaselessly.Schubring, Walther (1995), pp. 204‚Äì246 This cyclic nature eliminates the need for a creator, destroyer or external deity to maintain the universe. The wheel of time is divided into two half- rotations, Utsarpi·πáƒ´ or ascending time cycle and Avasarpi·πáƒ´, the descending time cycle, occurring continuously after each other. Utsarpi·πáƒ´ is a period of progressive prosperity and happiness where the time spans and ages are at an increasing scale, while Avsarpi·πáƒ´ is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality.Jaini (1998) =Concept of reality= This universe is made up of what Jainas call the six dravyas or substances classified as follows ‚Äì * Jƒ´va ‚Äì The living substances * Ajƒ´va ‚Äì Non-Living Substances ** Pudgala or Matter ‚Äì Matter is solid, liquid, gas, energy, fine karmic materials and extra-fine matter or ultimate particles. ParamƒÅnu or ultimate particles are the basic building block of matter. One quality of paramƒÅnu and pudgala is permanence and indestructibility. It combines and changes its modes but its qualities remain the same. According to Jainism, it cannot be created nor destroyed. ** Dharma-tattva or Medium of Motion and Adharma-tattva or Medium of Rest ‚Äì Also known as DharmƒÅstikƒÅya and AdharmƒÅstikƒÅya, they are distinct to Jain thought depicting motion and rest. They pervade the entire universe. Dharma-tattva and Adharma-tattva are by itself not motion or rest but mediate motion and rest in other bodies. Without dharmƒÅstikƒÅya motion is impossible and without adharmƒÅstikƒÅya rest is impossible in the Universe. ** ƒÄkƒÅ≈õa or Space ‚Äì Space is a substance that accommodates living souls, matter, the principles of motion and rest, and time. It is all-pervading, infinite and made of infinite space-points. ** KƒÅla or Time ‚Äì Time is a real entity according to Jainism and all activities, changes or modifications are achieved only in time. Time is like a wheel with twelve spokes divided into descending and ascending: half with six stages of immense durations, each estimated at billions of \\"ocean years\\" (sagaropama).James (1969) p. 45 In each descending stage, sorrow increases and at each ascending stage, happiness and bliss increase. These uncreated constituents of the universe impart dynamics upon the universe by interacting with each other. These constituents behave according to natural laws without interference from external entities. Dharma or true religion according to Jainism is vatthu sahƒÅvo dhammo translated as \\"the intrinsic nature of a substance is its true dharma.\\" =Material cause and effect= According to Jainism, causes are of two types ‚Äì UpƒÅdanƒÅ kƒÅrana (substantial or material cause) and Nimitta kƒÅrana (instrumental cause). UpƒÅdanƒÅ kƒÅrana is always identical with its effect.Nayanar (2005b), p.107 For example, out of clay, you can only produce a clay pot; hence the clay is the upƒÅdanƒÅ kƒÅrana or material cause and the clay pot its effect. Wherever the effect is present, the cause is present and vice versa. The effect is always present in latent form in the material cause. For transforming the clay to a pot, the potter, the wheel, the stick and other operating agents are required that are merely nimitta or instrumental causes or catalysts in transformation. The material cause always remains the clay. Hence the cause and effect are always entirely identical in nature. A potter cannot be the material cause of the pot. If this were the case, then the potter might as well prepare the pot without any clay. But this is not so. Thus a clay pot can only be made from clay; gold ornaments can be made only from gold. Similarly, the different modes of existence of a soul are a result of activities of the soul itself. There cannot be any contradiction or exceptions. In such a scenario, Jains argue that the material cause of a living soul with cetana (conscious entity) is always the soul itself and the cause of dead inert matter (non-cetana i.e. without any consciousness) is always the matter itself.Nayanar (2005b), p. 189, GƒÅthƒÅ 10.308‚Äì9 If God is indeed the creator, then this is an impossible predication as the same cause will be responsible for two contradictory effects of cetana (life) and acetana (matter).Nayanar (2005b), p. 73, GƒÅthƒÅ 2.85 This logically precludes an immaterial God (a conscious entity) from creating this universe, which is made up of material substances. =The soul= According to Jainism, one of the qualities of the soul is complete lordship of its own destiny.Nayanar (2005a), Gatha 27 The soul alone chooses its actions and the soul alone reaps its consequences. No god or prophet or angel can interfere in the actions or the destiny of the soul. It is the soul alone who makes the necessary efforts to achieve liberation without any divine grace.Nayanar (2005a), GƒÅthƒÅ 29ƒÄcƒÅrya Amrtacandra S≈´ri, Laghutattvasphota, S≈´tra 156 Jains frequently assert that ‚Äúwe are alone‚Äù in this world. Amongst the Twelve Contemplations (anupreksas) of Jains, one is the loneliness of one's soul and nature of the universe and transmigration. Hence only by cleansing our soul by our own actions can we help ourselves.Vallely (1980), p.182 Jainism thus lays a strong emphasis on the efforts and the free will of the soul to achieve the desired goal of liberation. Jaina conception of divinity Although the siddhas (the liberated beings) are formless and without a body, this is how the Jain temples often depict the siddhas. According to Jainism, gods can be categorized into Tƒ´rthankaras, arihants or ordinary kevalins and siddhas. Jainism considers the devƒ´s and devas to be celestial beings who dwell in heavens owing to meritorious deeds in their past lives. =Arhats= Arihants, also known as kevalins, are \\"gods\\" (supreme souls) in embodied states who ultimately become siddhas, or liberated souls, at the time of their nirvana. An arihant is a soul who has destroyed all passions, is totally unattached and without any desire and hence has destroyed the four ghƒÅtiyƒÅ karmas and attained Kevala j√±ƒÅna, or omniscience. Such a soul still has a body and four aghƒÅtiyƒÅ karmas. An arhata, at the end of his lifespan, destroys his remaining aghƒÅtiyƒÅ karma and becomes a siddha. =Tƒ´rthankaras= Tƒ´rthankaras (also known as Jinas) are arihants who are teachers and revivers of the Jain philosophy. There are 24 Tƒ´rthankaras in each time cycle; MahƒÅvƒ´ra was the 24th and last Tƒ´rthankara of the current time cycle. Tƒ´rthankaras are literally the ford makers who have shown the way to cross the ocean of rebirth and transmigration and hence have become a focus of reverence and worship amongst Jains. However it would be a mistake to regard the Tƒ´rthankaras as gods analogous to the gods of the Hindu pantheon despite the superficial resemblances in Jain and Hindu way of worship.Thrower (1980), p.93 Tƒ´rthankaras, like arhatas, ultimately become siddhas on liberation. Tƒ´rthankaras, being liberated, are beyond any kind of transactions with the rest of the universe. They are not the beings who exercise any sort of creative activity or who have the capacity or ability to intervene in answers to prayers. =Siddhas= Siddhashila as per the Jain cosmology Ultimately, all arihants and Tƒ´rthankaras become siddhas. A siddha is a soul who is permanently liberated from the transmigratory cycle of birth and death. Such a soul, having realized its true self, is free from all the karmas and embodiment. They are formless and dwell in Siddhashila (the realm of the liberated beings) at the apex of the universe in infinite bliss, infinite perception, infinite knowledge and infinite energy. Siddhahood is the ultimate goal of all souls. Jains pray to these passionless gods not for any favours or rewards but rather pray to the qualities of the god with the objective of destroying the karmas and achieving godhood. This is best understood by the term ‚Äì vandetadgunalabhdhaye i.e. we pray to the attributes of such gods to acquire such attributes‚Äù.Nayanar (2005b), p.35 GƒÅthƒÅ 1.29 =Heavenly beings ‚Äì Demi-gods and demi-goddesses= Jainism describes the existence of ≈õƒÅsanadevatƒÅs and ≈õƒÅsanadevƒ´s, the attendant gods and goddesses of Tƒ´rthankaras, who create the samavasarana or the divine preaching assembly of a Tƒ´rthankara. Worship of such gods is considered as mithyƒÅtva or wrong belief leading to bondage of karmas. However, many Jains are known to worship such gods for material gains. Nature of karmas According to Robert Zydendos, karma in Jainism can be considered a kind of system of laws, but natural rather than moral laws. In Jainism, actions that carry moral significance are considered to cause certain consequences in just the same way as, for instance, physical actions that do not carry any special moral significance. When one holds an apple in one's hand and then let go of the apple, the apple will fall: this is only natural. There is no judge, and no moral judgment involved, since this is a mechanical consequence of the physical action.Zydenbos (2006) Hence in accordance with the natural karmic laws, consequences occur when one utters a lie, steals something, commits acts of senseless violence or leads the life of a debauchee. Rather than assume that moral rewards and retribution are the work of a divine judge, the Jains believe that there is an innate moral order to the cosmos, self-regulating through the workings of karma. Morality and ethics are important, not because of the personal whim of a fictional god, but because a life that is led in agreement with moral and ethical principles is beneficial: it leads to a decrease and finally to the total loss of karma, which means: to ever increasing happiness. Karmas are often wrongly interpreted as a method for reward and punishment of a soul for its good and bad deeds. In Jainism, there is no question of there being any reward or punishment, as each soul is the master of its own destiny. The karmas can be said to represent a sum total of all unfulfilled desires of a soul. They enable the soul to experience the various themes of the lives that it desires to experience.Kuhn (2001) They ultimately mature when the necessary supportive conditions required for maturity are fulfilled.Acharya Umasvati, Tattvartha Sutra, Ch VIII, Sutra 21 Hence a soul may transmigrate from one life form to another for countless of years, taking with it the karmas that it has earned, until it finds conditions that bring about the fruits. Hence whatever suffering or pleasure that a soul may be experiencing now is on account of choices that it has made in past. That is why Jainism stresses pure thinking and moral behavior. Apart from Buddhism, perhaps Jainism is the only religion that does not invoke the fear of God as a reason for moral behavior. The karmic theory in Jainism operates endogenously. Tirthankaras are not attributed \\"absolute godhood\\" under Jainism. Thus, even the Tirthankaras themselves have to go through the stages of emanicipation, for attaining that state. While Buddhism does give a similar and to some extent a matching account for Gautama Buddha, Hinduism maintains a totally different theory where \\"divine grace\\" is needed for emanicipation. The following quote in Bhagavatƒ´ ƒÄrƒÅdhanƒÅ (1616) sums up the predominance of karmas in Jain doctrine:- Thus it is not the so-called all embracing omnipotent God, but the law of karma that is the all governing force responsible for the manifest differences in the status, attainments and happiness of all life forms. It operates as a self-sustaining mechanism as natural universal law, without any need of an external entity to manage them. Jain opposition to creationism Jain scriptures reject God as the creator of universe. 12th century ƒÄcƒÅrya Hemacandra puts forth the Jain view of universe in the Yoga≈õƒÅstra thus ‚Äì Besides scriptural authority, Jains also resorted to syllogism and deductive reasoning to refute the creationist theories. Various views on divinity and universe held by the vedics, sƒÅmkhyas, mimimsas, Buddhists and other schools of thought were analysed, debated and repudiated by the various Jain ƒÄcƒÅryas. However the most eloquent refutation of this view is provided by ƒÄcƒÅrya Jinasena in MahƒÅpurƒÅna thus ‚Äì Criticism Jainism, along with Buddhism, has been categorized as atheist philosophy (i.e. NƒÅstika dar≈õana) by the followers of Vedic religion. Those who did not believe in Vedas and rejected Brahma as the creator of the universe were labeled as NƒÅstika. However, the word NƒÅstika corresponds more to \\"heterodox\\" than to \\"atheism\\". Sinclair Stevenson, an Irish missionary, declared that \\"the heart of Jainism is empty‚Äù since it does not depend on beseeching an omnipotent God for salvation. While fervently appealing for them to accept Christianity, she says Jains believe strongly in forgiving others, and yet have no hope of forgiveness by a higher power. Jains believe that liberation is by personal effort, not an appeal for divine intervention.Stevenson (1999) (Original 1915) p. 289 If atheism is defined as disbelief in the existence of a god, then Jainism cannot be labeled as atheistic, as it not only believes in the existence of gods but also of the soul which can attain godhood. As Paul Dundas puts it ‚Äì \\"while Jainism is, as we have seen, atheist in a limited sense of rejection of both the existence of a creator God and the possibility of intervention of such a being in human affairs, it nonetheless must be regarded as a theist religion in the more profound sense that it accepts the existence of divine principle, the paramƒÅtmƒÅ i.e. God, existing in potential state within all beings\\".Dundas (2002) p.111 The Jaina position on God and religion from a perspective of a non-Jain can be summed up in the words of Anne Vallely.

He failed to make the Hammers' League sideafter becoming a full-timer in August 1969, but soon made an impact for Oxford United. Aylott joined an Oxford side already well-stocked with centre-backs and was converted to anchor man in midfield for the Reserves, who were embarking on their best season. He inched ahead of John Fleming to earn a League debut on 9 October 1971, against Middlesbrough, in place of Ron Atkinson and after a substitute slot, succeeded the injured, soon-to-depart, Atkinson for much of the rest of his Manor career. Sometimes he appeared as full-back. He scored his first goal on 18 December 1971, in a home match against Preston North End. The competition for midfield places intensified in 1973‚Äì1974, but Aylott enjoyed his best season in 1974‚Äì75. His last game for Oxford was 19 April 1976, away to Southampton.

It was founded in 1967 by music academics Christopher Hogwood and David Munrow and produced many highly influential recordings. The group disbanded in 1976 following Munrow's suicide. History The formation of the Early Music Consort in the late 1960s has been credited with popularising the genre of Early music in UK and being main instigator of the British Early music revival of the late 20th century. Munrow was inspired by the Alte Musik movement that had already gained popularity in Germany, and sought to foster an interest in music of the Medieval and Renaissance eras among British audiences. Munrow collaborated with Christopher Hogwood, with whom he had studied as Cambridge University in setting up a new specialist music group, originally called the Early Music Consort. The group's original line-up consisted of Munrow, a wind instrumentalist who played many different instruments; Hogwood playing keyboard and percussion; Mary Remnant on fiddle, organ and tabor; Oliver Brookes on viol; James Tyler on lute; and the countertenor James Bowman. Selected discography The Voyager Golden Record The Early Music Consort produced many influential collections of early music, typical of which was The Art of the Netherlands issued as a three- record set in 1976.

To this estate also belonged a few nearby places. On 28 October 895, King Zwentibold acknowledged the Abbey‚Äôs holdings after being requested to do so by Archbishop of Trier Ratbold. Listed in this directory of holdings is, among other places, Gladbach. Gladbach was a lordly domain of the Duchy of Luxembourg and was assigned to the lordship of Bruch. In Gladbach and nearby Bruch, unlike the development in Dreis, the Abbey of Echternach could not extend its lordly authority, as the river Salm formed the boundary between the Duchy of Luxembourg and the Electorate of Trier. Gladbach and Bruch lay on the Salm‚Äôs right bank, putting them on the Luxembourg side. Beginning in 1794, Gladbach lay under French rule. In 1814 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1947, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

Amnesty International South Africa was founded in 1990 and grew from modest beginnings to become a key player in South Africa's transition to democracy and an important part of Amnesty's international movement, hosting the Amnesty International ICM in 1997. Today Amnesty International South Africa continues to campaign on multiple fronts including human rights education, women's rights, arms control and Zimbabwe. History Amnesty International did not have a group presence in South Africa up to the end of the 1980s because mixed race meeting were not allowed under the apartheid regime. However, there were individual members linked to London. It was only in 1990 when the local situation improved with a reduction in repression and the unbanning of the ANC and its allied organisations, that the International Secretariat allowed the formation of groups in the country. In 1990-92, four groups started around the country - Port Elizabeth was the first group, followed by Durban, Pietermartizburg and Pretoria. Members from these groups met in 1993 to form a national coordinating committee (some representatives Piotr Nowosad and Linda Stiebel). By that time there were additional groups in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Grahamstown. A national office was opened in Cape Town in 1995 and this moved to Pretoria in 1998. By that time a Board had taken the place of the NCC. A director was appointed for the first time in 2001. Amnesty South Africa's achievements in the 1990s included lobbying to abolish the death penalty; developing a national police human rights training programme focusing on children's rights; and lobbying to stop South African arms sales to states such as Turkey, Rwanda and Burundi, whose human rights records were questionable. In 1995 Pierre Sane, Amnesty International's secretary general, visited South Africa and met the deputy president Thabo Mbeki to discuss human rights abuses in South Africa, Nigeria and the African Great Lakes region. In 1997, Amnesty South Africa hosted the international movement's ICM meeting in Cape Town, also attended by nobel prizewinner Archbishop Desmond Tutu. In 2006 the membership at the AGM voted for the Programme for Growth which allowed the International Mobilisation Fund, based at the International Secretariat, to take over governance and management of the organisation for a period of 2‚Äì3 years. Campaigns today Amnesty International South Africa runs a national human rights education programme , campaigns strongly to stop violence against women and against human rights violations in Zimbabwe . The Darfur conflict in Sudan is one of Amnesty International's top priorities, as a result of the large scale human rights abuses occurring. Amnesty has called for the introduction of a United Nations peacekeeping force to prevent conflict and stop further unnecessary suffering.

Sprague de Camp, the eighth book of his Viagens Interplanetarias series and the sixth of its subseries of stories set on the fictional planet Krishna. Chronologically it is the fourth Krishna novel. It was first published in hardcover by Phantasia Press in 1982, and in paperback by Ace Books in April 1983 as part of the standard edition of the Krishna novels. An E-book edition was published by Gollancz's SF Gateway imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form.Orion Publishing Group's L. Sprague de Camp webpageAmazon.com entry for e-book edition The novel has also been translated into German. As with all of the \\"Krishna\\" novels, the title of The Prisoner of Zhamanak has a \\"Z\\" in it, a practice de Camp claimed to have devised to keep track of them. Short stories in the series do not follow the practice, nor do Viagens Interplanetarias works not set on Krishna. Plot and storyline Word comes to the Terran spaceport of Novorecife that anthropologist Alicia Dyckman, off studying the culture of the tropical Khaldoni nations, has been imprisoned in Zhamanak, one of these realms, by its Heshvavu (king) Khorosh. Diplomat Percy Mjipa, currently between consular assignments, promptly volunteers to rescue her. Mjipa travels by ship to Kalwm, the much-shrunken remnant of the ancient Empire of the Triple Seas, whose mad king Vuzhov is attempting to build a tower to reach the heavens. From there he attempts to reach Zhamanak by road through the intervening realm of Mutabwk. Mutabwk's scholarly king Ainkhist refuses him passage unless he does him the service of obtaining a copy of Vuzhov's jealously-guarded genealogy, which he desires as a source for a history he is writing of the Khaldoni kingdoms. Perforce returning to Kalwm, Mjipa is unexpectedly granted a copy of the chart in return for serving as a witness for the prosecution at the heresy trial of Doctor Isayin, a local philosopher charged with teaching the world is round. Expected to support the Khaldoni religion's flat world theory, Mjipa uncomfortably commits the requisite perjury, salving his conscience by telling himself the proceedings are fixed against Isayin anyway. Standard Ace edition of The Prisoner of Zhamanak. Ace Books, 1983. With passage through Mutabwk now open to him, Mjipa finally reaches Zhamanak. However, Khorosh's only response to his demand that Dyckman be freed is to imprison him with her. He learns that Khorosh regards the alien Terrans as enemies, and that the purpose of their incarceration is to study them. More specifically, now that the king has two of them, he wants to see how they mate. Mjipa, who is married, indignantly refuses, and Alicia, while not sharing his qualms, is also disinclined to perform to satisfy their captor's curiosity. In the course of a long incarceration, they get to know each other, and at times their resolve weakens, but their incompatible personalities help keep them honest; Mjipa being stiff-necked and duty-driven, and Alicia strong-willed, hectoring and opinionated. At length the two pretend to agree to Khorosh's demand, but only to lure him into the cell, where the powerful Mjipa quickly overpowers him and takes him hostage. Keeping the king's soldiers at bay by threatening his safety, they effect their escape and flee back to Mutabwk, only to be taken prisoner again! It seems that King Ainkhist, also curious in regard to Terran biology, had made certain advances to Alicia during her earlier passage through his realm on her way to Zhamanak, which she repulsed. This time he is determined to have his way with her. Alicia, being a practical sort, sees no alternative this time and so complies, much to her rescuer's chagrin. Allowed to proceed, the pair continues on to Kalwm. While awaiting a ship to take them to safety, Mjipa and Alicia take in the sights of Kalwm, try to avoid the assassins dispatched on their trail by the vengeful Khorosh, and plot to free the doomed Doctor Isayin, as Mjipa is conscience-stricken by his role in the doctor's condemnation. They succeed in spiriting Isayin out of jail, concealing him in Vuzhov's fabulous tower, but are overtaken by the assassins. Forced to fight their way free of the tower, they flee to their ship, the Tarvazid, and make sail; the assassins pursue in another ship, but are defeated. Mjipa maroons the remaining assassins on the island of Fossanderan, where the Tarvazid has put in for repairs. Undeterred, the assassins await their chance and ambush the Terrans, only to be taken in turn by the tailed natives of Fossanderan, who assume them to be slavers. Recognizing Mjipa from a previous diplomatic mission, the natives free the Terrans. Continuing on their way, the two finally return to Novorecife, dropping off Isayin on the way in the free city of Majbur. Back in the Terran enclave the travelers are enthusiastically welcomed. During the ensuing festivities, Alicia encounters tour guide Fergus Reith (protagonist of the earlier novel The Hostage of Zir) and he and she fall head-over-heels in love with each other. Mjipa and his wife, happy to be reunited, look on and foresee trouble ahead. Setting The planet Krishna is de Camp's premier creation in the Sword and Planet cretion from me genre, representing both a tribute to the Barsoom novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs and an attempt to \\"get it right\\", reconstructing the concept logically, without what he regarded as Burroughs' biological and technological absurdities. De Camp intended the stories as \\"pure entertainment in the form of light, humorous, swashbuckling, interplanetary adventure-romances - a sort of sophisticated Burroughs-type story, more carefully thought out than their prototypes.\\"De Camp, L. Sprague. \\"The Krishna Stories\\" (Essay, in New Frontiers, v. 1, no. 1, Dec. 1959, page 3.) As dated in James Cambias's GURPS Planet Krishna (a 1997 gaming guide to the Viagens series authorized by de Camp), the action of The Prisoner of Zhamanak takes place in the year 2146 AD., falling between The Hostage of Zir and The Virgin of Zesh (more conclusively dated to 2150), and making it the eighth story set on Krishna in terms of chronology. Internal evidence in The Bones of Zora, which closely follows Virgin, indicates that Prisoner may precede these stories more immediately, which could put its events as late as 2149. Reception Publishers Weekly calls the book a \\"light adventure of rescue and escape ... diverting pure entertainment, with comic sparkle and lots of dash.\\"\\"Science Fiction. The Prisoner of Zhamanak\\" (review). In Publishers Weekly, v. 221, no. 14, April 2, 1982, p. 71. Susan L. Nickerson, writing for Library Journal demurs, stating that while \\"Percy's halting progress across three primitive kingdoms is mildly amusing, ... his imprisonment with Alicia so that Khorosh can watch Terran sexual methods is a scenario full of unfulfilled potential. Not one of de Camp's best efforts, Prisoner verges on the tedious.\\"Nickerson, Susan L. \\"de Camp, L. Sprague. The Prisoner of Zhamanak\\" (review). In Library Journal, May 15, 1982, pp. 1013-1014. Robert Coulson in Amazing Science Fiction Stories, reviewing the book together with the a new edition of The Hand of Zei (which he considers \\"the first (and probably best) novel of the series\\") calls Prisoner \\"[s]horter than Zei and less inventive, but sufficiently amusing to be well worth reading.\\"Coulson, Robert. \\"Book Reviews.\\" In Amazing Science Fiction Stories, v. 56, no. 4 [misnumbered v. 28, no. 9], January 1983, p. 19. Don D'Ammassa notes that \\"[a]though there is a strong flavor of humor in most of de Camp's fiction, this is the funniest of the Krishna stories, and one of the best.\\" Addressing this and other late entries in the Viagens series, he writes \\"[t]he quality of the series remains undiminished in [these] volumes, which combine good-natured mayhem and a crisp, exciting narrative style.D'Ammassa, Don. \\"de CAMP, L. Sprague.\\" In Twentieth-Century Science-Fiction Writers, Third Edition, Chicago : St. James Press, c1991, p. 192. Greg Costikyan reviewed The Prisoner of Zhamanak in Ares Magazine #15 and commented that \\"Readers should not be put off by the pulpish names of the Krishna novels; The Prisoner of Zhamanak is not Conan the Blood-Drenched. Rather it is de Camp at his best.\\" Relation to other works The main plot device of bickering male and female protagonists not destined for a happy ending together is featured in several late de Camp novels, notably The Bones of Zora (1983), The Incorporated Knight (1987), and The Pixilated Peeress (1991).

In 1285 Giovanni's uncle, Cardinal Savelli, was elected Pope Honorius IV. Giovanni Boccamazza began his career in the Church as a Canon of the Vatican BasilicaJohrendt, Die Diener des Apostelf√ºrsten, 451-452. and Chaplain of Pope Nicholas III (1277-1280). Bishop of Monreale He was made Archbishop of Monreale, near Palermo, by Pope Nicholas III on 15 August 1278.Conradus Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi I, editio altera (Monsterii 1913), p. 348. He had not, however, been the original choice as bishop. The Chapter of the Cathedral of Monreale had originally and unanimously chosen Guillaume, Bishop of Potenza, but he declined the position and resigned the election into the hands of the Pope. The matter was referred to the usual committee of cardinals on episcopal elections, in this case composed of Cardinals Latino Malabranca Orsini, Guillaume de Bray, and Matteo Rosso Orsini. Nicholas then received the bishop's resignation of the election to Monreale and sought to appoint Bernard de Montemirato, OSB, the Abbot of Montismajoris in the Diocese of Arles.Denis Sammarthani (editor), Gallia christiana I (Paris 1716), p. 610. But he flatly refused. Nicholas then chose his Chaplain, Giovanni Boccamazza.Jules Gay (editor), Registres de Nicolas III (Paris 1898), no. 120, pp. 38-39. He was there at the time of the Sicilian Vespers (1282). It was Cardinal Boccamazza who delivered the news of the Sicilian Vespers to King Charles I of Anjou V.

Legate in Germany As soon as Honorius IV became pope, he was approached by King Rudolf of Germany, King of the Romans, with regard to his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor. This honor had been promised him by Gregory X in 1275, but succeeding popes had not authorized the coronation. Now he approached the new pope through the new Archbishop of Mainz, Heinrich de Isnay, O.Min. (1286-1288). In reply Honorius sent Cardinal Giovanni Boccamazza as Apostolic Legate to Germany, Bohemia, Hungary and Sweden to engage in conversations with Rudolf.The continuator of Martinus Polonus, in G. Pertz (ed.), Monumenta Germaniae Historica Vol. 22 (Hannover 1872), p. 482. Cardinal Giovanni attended the significant synod of March 1287 in W√ºrzburg, considered as a German national council.Pawlicki, pp. 81-88.

On 22 July 1287, during the Sede Vacante following the death of Honorius IV (1285-1287), he was at Cambrai, where he issued orders for Dacia and Suecia.Augustus Potthast, Regesta pontificum Romanorum II (Berlin 1875), no. 22598. While he was at Cambrai the Legate, Cardinal Giovanni was attacked by a nobleman, Nicholas, his brothers and sons, and his retainers, while he was in church. When that attempt failed, they followed him to his house, where there was a riot. The bishop of Cambrai, who held both spiritual and temporal power in the city, was excommunicated by Cardinal Giovanni, and the city was placed under interdict. When Cardinal Giovanni returned to Rome and explained the whole affair to Pope Nicholas personally, the Pope cited the Bishop, the Archdeacon, the Bailli, the Chapter of the Cathedral, and numerous others, to appear before his court in Rome.E. Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV (Paris 1905) no. 582, p. 116-117. The case was finally disposed of on 3 October 1291 with the suspension of the Bishop from his pontifical powers and right to collate to benefices for three years.E. Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV (Paris 1905) no. 6140, p. 827-828. Also, during the same Legatine assignment, Cardinal Giovanni became involved in strife between the Dominicans and the people of Strasbourg, and he felt compelled to lay the city under the Interdict.E. Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV (Paris 1905) no. 2683, pp. 447-448. On 16 September 1287 Cardinal Giovanni was at Clairvaux,Potthast, no. 22599. and he was still there on 8 November, when he wrote to the Archbishop of Uppsala, Sweden (Suecia),Potthast, no. 22601. and 6 December 1287, when he wrote to the Dominicans of Hungary and Poland.Potthast, no. 22602. He wrote from Novaevallis, on 14 December, to all of the clergy in his Legation for the benefit of the Cistercians.Potthast, no. 22603. He did not, therefore, attend the Conclave of 1287-1288. Work in the Roman Curia He was back in Italy, at Rieti, in September, 1288, when he subscribed a bull for Pope Nicholas IV.E. Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV (Paris 1905) no. 243 (3 September 1288). Later in the year, in Rome, he was a member of an examination committee of an abbot-elect.E. Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV (Paris 1905) no. 397 (31 October 1288). On 28 January 1289 he is mentioned as having been an Auditor in the case involving the canonical election of a bishop of Avignon.E. Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV (Paris 1905) no. 532, p. 104. Two days later he was assigned the task of consecrating the newly approved Archbishop of Crete.E. Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV (Paris 1905) no. 541. In September 1290 Cardinal Giovanni served on the examination committee that investigated the contested election to the Bishopric of Alatri.E. Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV (Paris 1905) no. 3316, p. 525 (Orvieto, 16 September 1290). In March 1291 he was a member of the committee that reviewed the election of the Abbot of S. Albans.E. Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV (Paris 1905) no. 4638, p. 667. At nearly the same time, he did the same in the case of the monastery of S. Pietro in Perugia.E. Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV (Paris 1905) no. 4911, p. 694. On 5 March 1291 Pope Nicholas granted Cardinal Giovanni Boccamazza the power to investigate and reform the apparently large number of encroachments and illegal occupations made by various persons upon the properties belonging to the Lateran Basilica. The Senators and other magistrates of Rome were ordered to assist the Cardinal in restoring the properties of S. Giovanni Laterano.E. Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV (Paris 1905) no. 4557-4558, p. 657. The same service was imposed on Cardinal Giovanni with respect to the Premonstratensian monastery of S. Quirico de valle introducti in the diocese of Reate.E. Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV (Paris 1905) no. 6521, p. 871 (13 January 1292). He was then empowered to do the same for the Monastery of Farfa.E. Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV (Paris 1905) no. 6948, p. 928 (18 March 1292). At the end of November 1295 Cardinal Giovanni was present and working in the Roman Curia, and was one of eighteen cardinals who received a distribution from the funds of the Treasury of the College of Cardinals.Johann Peter Kirsch, Die FInanzverwaltung des Kardinalkollegiums im XIII. und XIV. Jahrhundert (M√ºnster 1895), p. 98. On 12 March 1296 he was one of twenty-one cardinals who received a 1/18 share in the payment of 2000 livres Tournois presented by the Procurators of the Abbot of Cluny.Kirsch, p. 112-113. At Easter 1296 he had his share of 600 gold florins presented by the Archbishop of Florence; and likewise a share in the 400 gold florins presented by the Bishop of Tortona in Lombardy.Kirsch, p. 113. On 29 April he shared in the 600 florins paid by the Bishop of Famagusta. At Pentecost 1296, eighteen cardinals shared in the 1900 florins presented by the Bishop of S√©ez; and a distribution of the 500 livres Tournois paid by the Archbishop of Rouen; and a 1/23 share in the 50 livres of the Bishop of Teramo.Kirsch, p. 115. On 29 June 1296 there was a distribution of 500 florins paid by the Bishop of Patras. Around the Feast of S. Michael, 29 September 1296 he received a share of the payment made through the bankers of the Abbot of S. Victor of Marseille.Kirsch, p. 112. On 10 May 1297 he was present at the degrading of Cardinals Jacobus and Petrus Colonna, from whose confiscated income Pope Boniface VIII granted a half to the cardinals, nineteen of whom are named, included Giovanni of Tusculum.Kirsch, p. 102. He also participated in a distribution of 5 gold pieces which had been offered by the Archbishop of Strigonia at his ad limina visit. On 24 June 1297 he was one of twenty-two cardinals who received his share of the money offered by the Abbot of S. Justinus in Padua; of the money offered by the Bishop of Padua; and of the money brought by the Proctor of the Bishop of Siena.Kirsch, p. 103. At Easter 1298 the Archbishop of Tours visited Rome, and presented the College of Cardinals with 200 livres Tournois, which was divided among fourteen cardinals, including Giovanni of Tusculum. At the same time the sum of 2500 florins out of the payment of the Bishop of Zaragoza was distributed to the same cardinals; and a distribution from the sum of 2000 florins paid by the Bishop of Pamiers.Kirsch, p. 120. On 20 May 1298 the 500 florins brought by the Bishop of Lod√®ve was shared by eighteen cardinals in the Curia; at the same time there was a distribution of the 1000 gold florins paid by the Bishop of Urgel; and a distribution from the 500 livres Tournois presented by the Archbishop of Rouen. On 2 June 1298 the Abbot of Subiaco paid 300 gold florins owed by his predecessor, which was shared by twenty cardinals.Kirsch, p. 121. On 5 September 1298 there was a distribution of the payment of 180 livres Tournois made by the Abbot of the Major Monasterium in Tours, with a 1/15 share coming to Cardinal Giovanni of Tusculum.Kirsch, p. 124. These are only examples, showing the very large, if irregular, income of a cardinal at the time, and indicating that a cardinal was present in the Roman Curia at the time. Cardinals who were not present in the Curia (except occasionally deceased cardinals, whose estates benefitted from a late payment of dues) did not share in the distributions; this applied to Papal Legates, who had to be paid by the Pope through the Apostolic Camera, not by the Camera of the College of Cardinals. On 1 February 1301 Cardinal Giovanni of Tusculum, who had been acting as Assessor (judge) on appointment by Boniface VIII, pronounced his verdict in the case of the contested election of Leo, Bishop of Soli in Cyprus.Georges Digard (editor), Les Registres de Boniface VIII (Paris 1907), no. 3957. On 20 May 1301 he and three other cardinals, Jean de Cressi, Robert de Pontigny and Matteo Rosso Orsini, were given the mandate to choose a new Abbot of the Monastery of S. Richard in the Diocese of Amiens.Digard, Les Registres de Boniface VIII, no. 4069. In June 1301 he was Auditor in the request that the Cathedral of Sagunto be transferred from regular to secular clergy.Digard, Les Registres de Boniface VIII, no. 4081. On 20 September 1301 his name heads the list of fifteen cardinals, ahead of Bishops Theoderic (Civitas Papalis) and Leonardo (Albano), subscribing to the papal grant of privileges to the Monastery of Santa Croce Saxivivo in the Diocese of Foligno.Digard, Les Registres de Boniface VIII, no. 4132. Cardinal Niccol√≤ Boccasini, OP, Bishop of Ostia, who would normally have signed first as senior Cardinal Bishop, was serving as Legate in Hungary. When the year 1301 began, the Curia was resident at the Lateran Palace in Rome; from 1 May to mid- October it was in Anagni; from 17 October to the end of the year it was back at the Lateran. In January 1302 Cardinal Giovanni served on a committee to examine the election of the Bishop of Cammin in Germany.Digard, Les Registres de Boniface VIII, no. 4481 (Lateran). On 2 July 1302 he is noted as having on a committee which examined the election and person of John, Abbot of Holy Cross Monastery in Waltham in the Diocese of London.Digard, Les Registres de Boniface VIII, no. 4721 (Anagni). In 1302, Cardinal Giovanni Boccamazza was Canon of the Cathedral of Amiens.G. Boudon, \\"Un feuillet du registre de la Quotidiane du Chapitre de N√¥tre-Dame d' Amiens,\\" Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© des antiquaires de Picardie 18 (1892-1893-1894) (Paris 1895), p. 322. At the beginning of 1303 Cardinal Giovanni was consulted by the Pope concerning the depredations which had taken place against the Chapter of the Cathedral of Cambrai.Digard, Les Registres de Boniface VIII, no. 5149 (13 February 1303). Papal Elector He participated in five papal conclaves, which saw the elections of popes Nicholas IV in 1288, Celestine V in 1294, Boniface VIII in 1294, Benedict XI in 1303 and Clement V in 1305. He became dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals in 1302, upon the death of Cardinal Gerardo Bianchi, Bishop of Sabina (1 March 1302). Reign of Benedict XI On 30 October 1303, a week after his election, Pope Benedict gave the College of Cardinals a gift of 2680 gold florins, 380 livres Tournois, and over 600 other gold coins of various origins and values. These funds were distributed among the Cardinals, including Cardinal Giovanni Boccamazza, except for the Bishop of Ostia, Niccol√≤ Boccasini, who was absent on a Legateship.Kirsch, p. 128. In 1304 Cardinal Giovanni was again a member of a committee of cardinals that examined the election of an abbot for the Benedictine monastery of S. Maria de Alfiolo in the Diocese of Gubbio;Ch. Grandjean (editor), Le Registre de Benoit XI (Paris 1905), no. 130, p. 112 (Lateran, 2 January 1304). and likewise for the Benedictine Monastery of S. Angelo de Gaifa in the Diocese of Urbino;Ch. Grandjean (editor), Le Registre de Benoit XI (Paris 1905), no. 518, p. 348 (Lateran, 17 February 1304). On 4 March 1304 Pope Benedict XI (1303-1304) granted Cardinal Giovanni Boccamazza subinfeudation of three castles, Scandrillia, Castellucii, and Rocca Soldana, which belonged to the Monastery of Farfa by primary infeudation of the Roman Church, along with their tenements and vassals, with full jurisdiction and authority. The properties and their rights would descend to the Cardinal's heirs.Ch. Grandjean (editor), Le Registre de Benoit XI (Paris 1905), no. 649, p. 412. Death Pope Nicholas IV had granted Cardinal Giovanni the privilege of making his own Will on 25 November 1289.E. Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV (Paris 1905) no. 1886, p. 341.

A two-time winner at the International Cross Country Championships (1955, 1957), Sando represented Great Britain in two consecutive Summer Olympic Games.  Early life  Sando was born on 31 March 1931 in Maidstone, to Ernest and Maria Sando. Attending Maidstone Grammar School, Sando first began his involvement in athletics at sixteen, breaking the school mile record. Simultaneously, he began an amateur career at Maidstone Harriers, winning the Kent County Junior Cross-Country Championship in 1948 and the Kent Youth Cross-Country Championship in 1949. He finished fourth in the English Youth Cross-Country Championship in 1948 and 1949. Having left school, Sando undertook National Service in October 1949, joining the army. In 1951, he broke the Army three-mile record which had stood for 23 years, having previously that year won the Inter-Services Cross-Country Championship.  Senior career  Leaving the army in 1951, he began working for the Reed Paper Group in Aylesford, Kent, where he met his future wife Sybil Page. After resigning from Maidstone Harriers, Sando joined the Paper Group's athletics club, juggling work, professional examinations, family commitments and his athletic career. It was at this time that he gained the nickname: the \\"Maidstone Mudlark\\". The following year, 1952, he finished fifth in the National Cross-Country Championships and ninth in the International Cross- Country Championships. Over the next eight years Sando maintained a record of finishing in the top eight positions in the International Championships, as well as an extended period of captaincy of the British team over seven years. In 1952 he was called up to represent Great Britain at the Helsinki Olympic Games, in the 10,000 m. It was in this event that he famously lost a shoe early in the race but, continuing on with one bare foot, he still managed to finish in fifth position. In 1954 Sando ran in the British Empire and Commonwealth Games, where he finished second in the six miles to Peter Driver and third in the three miles to Chris Chataway. Later in that year he finished third in the 10,000 m in the European Athletics Championships in Berne, Switzerland ‚Äì which was won by Emil Z√°topek. He married Sybil Page in September of the same year. Sando went on to win the International Cross- Country Championships in San Sebastien, Spain in 1955. In 1956, after returning from injury, he finished second in the International Cross-Country Championships. Running well in the domestic track season of 1956, Sando was selected to represent Great Britain in the 10,000 m in the Olympics of that year, where he finished in tenth position. He later described this as the greatest disappointment of his athletic career, and it was the final time he represented his country on the track. In 1957 Sando won the National Cross- Country Championship at Parliament Hill Fields and the International Championships. The International Championships of 1958 resulted in a 3rd-place finish for Sando and, in the two consecutive years, he finished 2nd and 8th in the same competition. However, in 1961 he failed to qualify for the national cross-country team. He subsequently decided to retire from serious athletics to concentrate on family commitments and further study, bringing to an end a long sporting career at the top of world athletics. He was one of many signatories in a letter to The Times on 17 July 1958 opposing 'the policy of apartheid' in international sport and defending 'the principle of racial equality which is embodied in the Declaration of the Olympic Games'.Brown and Hogsbjerg, Apartheid is not a game, 16  Later life  After retiring from athletics, Sando studied at Birkbeck College and graduated with a degree in Statistics in 1964. The following year he resigned from the Reeds Paper Group and joined the Civil Service. He retired from the Civil Service in 1991 as Chief Statistician. Sando continued his involvement with athletics in an organisational capacity into his later years, having been President of Kent County Athletics Association in 1980 and 2003, as well as various other administrative roles within the county organisation. Subsequent to his presidency of KCAA, he continued to be involved in organising grass roots cross-country events. From 2007‚Äì2008, Sando served as President of the Old Maidstonian Society.  Family and personal life  Sando was married to Sybil and the couple have two children ‚Äì Lorraine and Andrew ‚Äì and two grandchildren, Benjamin and Toby Abbott (who both attended Maidstone Grammar School like their grandfather). Until his death in October 2012, Frank continued to live in Aylesford, Kent with his wife ‚Äì within sight of the Aylesford Paper Mill training ground where his athletic career first began.

Despite being Kenyan-based the scheme awards artists from a variety of countries, predominantly Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, and incorporates a range of music genres.Yardflex: Kisima Music Awards in Kenya, written by Senabulya Frank 13 July 2006 History Named after the Swahili word for \\"well\\" the Kisima Awards was founded by Pete Odera and Tedd Josiah in 1994. The scheme initially aimed to recognise outstanding achievement in the performing arts and associated spheres such as education and business, and was held locally at Nairobi's Braeburn Theatre with clay trophies being awarded. This process continued annually with the awards being held at the Carnivore Restaurant, however in 1997 the scheme was discontinued. The awards were revitalised in 2003, with organisers arranging to coincide its events with the F√™te de la Musique. With increased funding and support from both government and sponsors the new scheme featured updated nomination and voting processes, larger award ceremonies held at a customised Kisima Dome tent and targeted artists from across the nation. However rather than all performing arts the new awards now recognised only musical talent. In 2004 the scheme was expanded to incorporate artists from all of East Africa, no longer restricting the talent to Kenya, and subsequently recognised musicians from Uganda and Tanzania.Art Matters: Kisima Music Awards haunt organisers In 2005 Tedd Josiah stepped down as CEO of the awards amid controversy surrounding his winning of the Best Producer Award, appointing Victor Mayeya Odwori in his place.Kisima Awards: Tedd Josiah Statement (13 April 2005) The awards have since continued to expand, attracting international entrants and personalities, and have come to be an integral part of both Kenyan music and culture.http://www.enterkenya.com/culture.html However, the 2008 event was repeatedly delayed and eventually held a year later.Daily Nation, 3 October 2009: Kisima woes Awards process =Categories= The Kisima Music Awards aim to cover a diverse range of music genres and the variety of roles within production. The categories have changed regularly since 2003, however those frequently recognised within the scheme are: * Best artist/group performing: ** Afro-fusion ** Asian Music ** Boomba Rap ** Boomba Pop ** Contemporary Gospel ** Eastern Benga ** Western Benga ** Hip hop ** R&B; ** Rap ** Reggae/Ragga ** Traditional * Best Artist/Group from Kenya/Tanzania/Uganda nb: separate award for each country * Best Music Video Kenya/Tanzania/Uganda nb: separate award for each country * Best Song * Best Album * Best Collaboration * Best Male Performer * Best Female Performer * Most Promising Performer * Best Group * Producer of the Year * Most Socially Aware Artist =Nomination and voting= Artists, groups and producers are able to nominate themselves for an award or be nominated, although they must approve the latter. To be eligible for nomination artists must have worked on a song or album that has been released in the year prior to the entry. A hard copy of the nominee's profile, photographs and a sample CD/cassette is required with the entry form.Kisima Nomination Process After the cut off date for nomination all entries are screened for eligibility and categories are determined based on the field of contestants. A \\"nomination academy\\" made up of recognised members of the East African music scene then reduce each category to 4‚Äì5 finalists based on artistic flair and technical achievement, sales and chart positions are not taken into account during nomination. The winners within each category are determined by a twofold voting system. The first is a percentage of the final score allocated to the nomination academy who individually vote for their preferred artist/group. The second is a larger percentage allocated to the general public who vote via SMS for their favourite artist after having access to various music samples on the official website. All the votes go to an independent auditing firm who determine the final winner.Details of Kisima Voting Process =Ceremony= The pinnacle of the awards process is the gala night, in which winners are announced and receive their trophies. The contestants and audience, a crowd of thousands drawn from both influential media, political and cultural personalities and paying members of the general public, are also treated to a variety of acts including musical performances, comedy routines and acrobatics. The night itself can last for up to six hoursOnly in Kenya: Kisima Reward Kenyas Finest and is broadcast across Africa by satellite television Channel O. After the gala night a winner's concert is held open to the public. Artists have also been called on to participate in tours in reflection of the social responsibility of the awardsKisima Awards: Celebrity Charity Tour =Social responsibility= The awards aim to foster social responsibility with both artists and their audience. This is achieved through presentations and speeches at the gala night, the recognition of a category dedicated to social awareness and charity concerts and tours held after the event. Through this the organisers hope to use music to improve conditions and reduce poverty in Africa. =Kisima Music Trust= The governing body behind the awards is the Kisima Music Trust. It operates as a non-profit body and aims to bring stability to the Kenyan music scene and to encourage artists to perform both domestically and internationally. The organisation derives most of its funding from sponsorship, with the largest donors including: * Kenya Government * Capital FM * 3 Mice * Deloitte * Baraka FM * Nu-Metro Cinema * TMX * Phat buzz * Init * Mac & More Solutions * Radar * Numetro Media Store Kisima Award winners Please see the respective page or website for the winners of that year *2003 Kisima Music Awards *2004 Kisima Music Awards *2005 Kisima Music Awards *2006 Kisima Music Awards *2007 Kisima Music Awards The 2012 winners included Nameless as top Fusion Artiste (also winner of the \\"Lifetime Achievement Award\\"), Daddy Owen as top Gospel Artiste, Avril as top Boomba Artiste, Nonini as Hip Hop Artiste, Wyre as top Ragga Reggae Artiste, Camp Mulla as Upcoming Group, P-Unit and Sauti Sol as top Collaboration, Willie Owusu for top Music Video (Color Kwa Face - Nonini), Chameleone for East African Recognition Award, and Daddy Owen / Denno as Artiste / Group of the Year. The full list of nominees is also available on the award website. Controversy The Kisima Awards have experienced their share of controversy. In 2004 the then CEO of the scheme Tedd Josiah received the award for Best Producer, and faced allegations of \\"swinging himself an award\\". He subsequently resigned citing a conflict of interest, and claimed he had pleaded with the judges not to allow him in the category.Pulse: February 2005 Tedd resigns from Kisima committee Musicians and producers such as Lydia Achieng Abura have also been critical of the voting system used to decide the awards, citing that SMS was predominantly used by youth and that this combined with the ability to vote an indefinite number of times would produce a flawed representation of the popularity of an artist. They claim that voting should lie with a panel of judges. In 2006 at least five artist refused to attend the winners concert, Beach Fusion, claiming they had not entered into a performance contract with the event organisers. These claims were refuted by the organisers, who alleged the concert was solely for charity and that contestants had been briefed prior to the eventsKenya Times Newspaper: BEACH FUSION AND MORE!

History  In 1161, the placename Kinheim had its first documentary mention. The name‚Äôs meaning is uncertain. It is believed that the determiner Ken is of pre- Roman origin. The root word Heim suggests that Kinheim was an early Frankish settlement.Erwin Schaaf: Verbandsgemeinde Kr√∂v-Bausendorf. Land und Leute in alten Fotos. Geiger-Verlag, Horb am Neckar 2006, S. 114-115. The outlying centre of Kindel across the river was named as early as 1069 as Kennelle, and was later called Kinelle (1304) or Kinnel (1404). Kindel is surely a daughter settlement of Kinheim, for Kennelle means ‚Äúlittle Kindel‚Äù. Furthermore, Kinheim had an outlying centre in the Alf valley, today‚Äôs Kinderbeuern (1296: Kynheymerb√ºren), which until sometime about 1740 was politically united with the municipality of Kinheim. Beginning in 1794, XXX lay under French rule as part of the D√©partement de Rhin-et-Moselle (Rhein-Mosel-D√©partement in German). In 1814 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In the outlying centre of Kindel, the remnants of a Celtic-Roman estate from the 3rd century were unearthed. This also entailed the discovery of a high relief of the hammer god Sucellus. This archaeological find is said to be the oldest evidence of winegrowing on the Moselle.  Politics  = Municipal council = The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat = Coat of arms = The municipality‚Äôs arms might be described thus: Or an eagle bicapitate displayed sable armed and langued gules, on his breast an inescutcheon chequy of sixteen argent and gules, between the heads a royal crown proper.Kinheim‚Äôs arms = Town partnerships = Kinheim fosters partnerships with the following places: * Harelbeke, West Flanders, Belgium * Ambonnay, Marne, France  Culture and sightseeing  = Clubs = The clubs in Kinheim-Kindel include a gymnastic and sport club, a Winzerkapelle (‚Äúwinemakers‚Äô orchestra‚Äù), a volunteer fire brigade, the village youth club and a Carnival club. These clubs organize and stage several events over the year.  Economy and infrastructure  * The municipality is characterized by winegrowing and tourism. Thriving in roughly 120 ha of vineyards are wine grapes in the locations of Rosenberg, Hubertuslay and R√∂merhang (‚ÄúRomans‚Äô Slope‚Äù). All three locations belong to the winemaking appellation ‚Äì Gro√ülage ‚Äì of Schwarzlay and to the winegrowing domain of Bernkastel in the Mosel wine region. * Kinheim is a state-recognized recreational municipality (Erholungsort). * Running through the municipality is Bundesstra√üe 53. To the west runs the Autobahn A 1\\\\. Access thereto is gained through the Wittlich-Mitte interchange about 15 km away. After the completion of the High Moselle Crossing (Hochmosel√ºbergang ‚Äì a highway link whose centrepiece will be a long, high bridge over the Moselle), the four-lane Bundesstra√üe 50 will be reachable through the Erden-L√∂snich interchange about 4 km away beginning in 2016, shortening the travelling time to the A 61 at the Rheinb√∂llen interchange from the roughly 50 minutes that it takes now to an expected 40 minutes or so. * In nearby √úrzig is a railway station on the Koblenz-Trier railway line.

It was announced in June 2007 as the flagship product in Sony Ericsson's K (\\"Kamera\\") series, with a 5 megapixel CMOS camera sensor. The K850 was the first Sony Ericsson phone released outside of NTT DoCoMo to support microSD and microSDHC along with Sony's traditional M2. It also introduces the usage of three touch-sensitive softkeys right under the display and a new form of navigation button, omitting the classic joystick introduced with the Ericsson T68. The camera interface has been revamped to resemble the format of cybershot digital cameras. According to the manufacturer the UMTS talk time has been significantly increased to 3 hours 30 min over its predecessor, the K800 and K810. (K800 2 hrs 30 min). It was Sony Ericsson's first 3.5G HSDPA supporting mobile phone, and was also the first 3G \\"global\\" mobile with supporting all major operating network frequency in the world including GSM 850, GSM 900, GSM 1800, GSM 1900, HSDPA, UMTS 850, UMTS 1900, UMTS 2100. Design and features The phone introduces a new button in the Cyber-shot line: on the right side a switch allows choosing between photo, video and playback mode. The phone is available in the colours \\"Luminous Green\\", \\"Velvet Blue\\" and \\"Quicksilver Black\\". Key features include: * 3G video calling * Cyber-shot 5-megapixel camera with Xenon flash and additional 3 LED flash for video recording * Bluetooth 2.0 (10 m) * Web Access (NetFront browser included) * Exchange ActiveSync * 3.5G high speed internet (Support up to 3.6 Mbit/s (download speed), 384 kbit/s (upload speed)) * Multiple audio playback (AAC, WAV, MP3, WMA) * Built in Media Center (Sony PSP/PS3 XrossMediaBar menu) * Video player with progressive fast forward and slow motion * Memory Stick slot to expand the memory to up to 16 GB. Camera Information 5.04 megapixel CMOS sensor, 16x digital zoom, natural color rendering, and built in xenon flash plus three additional LEDs for autofocusing and can be used for video recording. It also features Bestpic (Sony Ericsson's brand name for burst mode) which captures nine images in a row then you can choose the ones you want to save. In camera mode the keypad is differently lit so the user can easily find the camera shortcut buttons (Shoot mode, Scenes, Self-timer, Flash mode). In common with the K810i and the K800, programs called Photo Fix, HP print and Face Warp are bundled with the K850i. Users can also easily increase the brightness and the contrast of the photo with PhotoFix and PhotoDJ. Video recording is QVGA (320√ó240) at 30 frames per second. (K800 QCIF (176√ó144) @ 15 frame/s.) Supports Image and Video Stabilizer so videos and photos taken would be less likely to appear blurred and shaky. There have been major software problems in the past but now have been solved. Moreover, as in most Sony Ericsson phones, the camera software, called camdriver, can be modified to bring new features along with considerable improvement. The line of camdrivers known as Cybershot Xperience, developed by Hasaan Rafique (known online as Witchking) is the most promising as it implements many additional features like Manual Focus, Contrast, Saturation, Colour Balance, ISO, Shutter-speed and so on. It also allows the user to increase the video recording resolution.

The central site covers an area of 4.5 km2; the greater oasis extends over an area of 22 km2. The site flourished from the sixth century as a site along the southern branch of the Silk Road until its abandonment before the Tibetan advance at the end of the eighth century. Dandan Oilik was rediscovered and partially excavated by a succession of foreign explorers starting in 1896, and has yielded rich finds including manuscripts, stucco reliefs, painted wooden panels, and murals. A detailed survey was conducted in 2006 although much of the site remains unexcavated. Dandan Oilik is currently off-limits to the public. Rediscovery After over a millennium of abandonment to the shifting sands, Dandan Oilik was rediscovered in 1896 by Swedish explorer Sven Hedin. Leaving his baggage in Khotan, Hedin set out on 14 January 1896 with a retinue of four men, three camels, and two donkeys, along with enough provisions to last fifty days. After five days the party left the White Jade River, heading east between the dunes, which gradually increased to a height of fifty feet. Steering through the or \\"passes\\" between the dunes, with live tamarisk or poplar indicating sources of water, ten days after departing Khotan Hedin rode his camel bareback to the \\"Buried City of Taklamakan\\". There he found traces of hundreds of wooden houses; a \\"Temple of Buddha\\", with walls constructed of bundles of reeds fixed to stakes, and covered in earthen plaster and wall paintings - of kneeling females, moustachioed males in Persian clothing, animals, and boats rocking in the waves; fragments of paper with indecipherable characters; a life-size gypsum foot; and a series of Buddha images. Most of the ruins, extending over an area two to two and a half miles across, were buried under high dunes. Hedin found that excavation was \\"desperate work\\", with the sand immediately filling whatever was dug, necessitating the removal of entire dunes; furthermore, and despite their antiquity, the camels and donkeys still \\"consumed with relish\\" the reeds once used in construction. Although unable to recover the overall plan of the city, Hedin found traces of gardens, rows of poplars indicating ancient avenues, and remains of ancient apricot and plum trees, concluding that \\"the walls of this God-accursed city, this second Sodom in the desert, had thus in ancient times been washed by a powerful stream - the Keriya-daria\\". Aurel Stein silkworm eggs in her headdress to smuggle them out of China to the Kingdom of Khotan. In December 1900, alerted in Khotan by a \\"reliable 'treasure-seeker'\\" who brought fragments of wall painting with Brahmi script, stucco reliefs, and paper documents from a site known locally as DandƒÅn-Uiliq, Aurel Stein set off in the footsteps of Hedin, accompanied by two of his guides and a team of thirty labourers, to begin excavations. He uncovered a series of structures (labelled by Stein D. I to D. XVII), including dwellings and a number of Buddhist shrines. D. II has a central rectangular platform surmounted by a moulded lotus statue base, on which only the foot of the image survives; the surrounding passage Stein identified as serving for parikrama (ritual circumambulation). In an adjoining smaller building was a headless Buddha which Stein carted off on a mule and is now in the British Museum; another headless figure, clad in mail, wearing wide boots similar to the soft leather chƒÅruks of contemporary Turkestan, trampling another figure, and thought to represent Kubera; and wall paintings of a seated monastic, a Buddha, horsemen, and a nude dancing girl in a pool of water against a backdrop of flowering lotus, adorned with jewels and a strategically placed vine leaf. Among the documents discovered, written in a variety of scripts on paper, wooden tablets, and sticks, were Buddhist texts; a petition for the recovery of a donkey after the failure of its two purchasers to pay even ten months later; a petition for exemption from requisitions of grain and forced labour after visitation by bandits; a request for the military of skins for drums and quail feathers for arrows; records of loans; and an important early Judeo-Persian document edited and dated to 718 by David Samuel Margoliouth seemingly concerned predominantly with the sale of sheep, complaints of unfair treatment, and the teaching of a girl. Aurel Stein translated the document into English. Later expeditions In 1905 geographer Ellsworth Huntington visited Dandan Oilik, observing that it was once watered by a river that no longer flows through the area. From 1928 and the visit of Emil Trinkler and Walter Bosshard, the site lay untouched for nearly seventy years until an initial inspection in 1996 by the Xinjiang Archaeological Institute. In 1998 Christoph Baumer led an expedition to the site, making further discoveries. In 2002 a joint expedition by teams from the Xinjiang Cultural Relics Bureau, the Xinjiang Archaeological Research Institute, and Niya Research Institute of Bukkyo University in Japan discovered a new Buddhist temple with wall paintings. This was subsequently excavated and thirty sections of the paintings were detached and removed to √úr√ºmqi. They include seated Buddhas, serial figures in the Thousand Buddha tradition, bodhisattvas, horsemen on dappled mounts and an inscription in the Iranian Saka language. In 2006, in recognition of its significance, Dandan Oilik was listed by State Administration of Cultural Heritage as a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level.

Geography  = Location = The municipality lies in the southern Eifel. The nearest middle centres are Wittlich and Bernkastel-Kues. The Gr√∂nbach and the Kramesbach empty into the Salm. Klausen belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Wittlich-Land, whose seat is in Wittlich, although that town is itself not in the Verbandsgemeinde. = Constituent communities = Klausen‚Äôs Ortsteile are Klausen, Pohlbach, Krames, Neu-Minheim, Hof Weidenhaag and Pohlbacher M√ºhle. = Climate = Yearly precipitation in Klausen amounts to 749 mm, falling into the middle third of the precipitation chart for all Germany. At 51% of the German Weather Service‚Äôs weather stations, lower figures are recorded. The driest month is February. The most rainfall comes in August. In that month, precipitation is 1.4 times what it is in February. Precipitation varies only minimally and is spread out quite evenly throughout the year.  History  In 1442, Klausen had its first documentary mention when Eberhard, who revered Mary, put up, on a spot where nothing had yet been built (but now the site of the Church of Eberhardsklausen) a wooden figure showing Mary with Jesus in her arms after having been taken off the cross (Piet√†). The figure was soon moved into a so-called Marienh√§uschen (‚Äúlittle Mary house‚Äù). Two years later came the building of the first chapel on this spot. On 25 March 1449, the Late Gothic Church of Mary (Marienkirche), work on which had begun in 1446 under Antwerp master builder Cluys, was consecrated by Archbishop of Trier Jakob von Sierck. About 1480 came the carved high altar, which is still to be found in the church today. It is one of the oldest preserved examples of ‚ÄúAntwerp altarpiece‚Äù production. A monastery of Augustinian canons from the Congregation of Windesheim, built near the church, was consecrated in 1461. The church soon developed into a pilgrimage site that still draws worshippers today in some numbers. In the course of the War of the Polish Succession, Imperial troops under Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff‚Äôs command beat a French army led by Marshal Fran√ßois de Franquetot de Coigny on 20 October 1735 at the Battle of Clausen (commonly spelt thus in English history texts). In 1802, the Augustinian canons‚Äô monastery was dissolved. The monastery church became a parish church that also ministered to the many pilgrims. In 1927, the parish in Klausen was raised to deaconry. On 7 June 1969 came the amalgamation of the municipalities of Krames and Pohlbach into the municipality of Klausen (the old Eberhardsklausen with the monastery zone was not a self-administering municipality, but rather it was shared between the municipalities of Krames and Pohlbach). Until the amalgamation of the municipalities of Krames and Pohlbach, Klausen was merely the parish‚Äôs name. In 1988, Klausen was awarded the statewide first prize in the contest ‚Äúfor exemplary ecological performance‚Äù and was the winner in its Regierungsbezirk in the contest Unser Dorf soll sch√∂ner werden (‚ÄúOur village should become lovelier‚Äù).  Politics  = Municipal council = The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"350\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"   FBL Klausen  WG Kohl  FWG Maes  WG Dietzen  SPD  Total - align=\\"center\\"  2009  11  5  ‚Äì  ‚Äì  ‚Äì  16 seats - align=\\"center\\"  2004  7  ‚Äì  5  3  1  16 seats } = Mayor = The Mayor is Alois Meyer, who reached the mayoralty in a runoff election on 27 June 2004. = Coat of arms = The German blazon reads: In Gold eine zur Kreuzblume erbl√ºhte blaue Lilie mit doppeltem gr√ºnen Fruchtknoten. The municipality‚Äôs arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Or a fleur-de-lis, the middle petal winged and charged with a cross azure, and doubly seeded vert.  Economy and infrastructure  Klausen has at its disposal a network of hiking trails roughly 60 km long. = Transport = Klausen is connected to the Autobahn A 1 through the Salmtal interchange one kilometre away. Landesstra√üen (State Roads) 47 (from Trier to Machern) and 50 (from Piesport to Binsfeld) both run right through the municipality and form the links to the neighbouring municipalities: Salmtal in the north, Piesport in the south, Esch and Sehlem in the east and Osann-Monzel in the west. = Local public transport = Klausen lies in cell 338 in the Verkehrsverbund Region Trier (VRT) plan and has all together 5 bus stops at its disposal. Bus route 304 of the Rhein-Mosel Verkehrsgesellschaft (RMV) links Klausen by way of Altrich several times daily (Saturdays only once; Sundays not at all) with the district seat of Wittlich, where transfers are possible in all directions at the bus station. RMV bus route 212 runs direct buses twice daily on weekdays between Klausen and the nearest city, Trier, passing through Esch, Rivenich, Hetzerath, F√∂hren and Schweich on the way. The nearest Regionalbahn stations are Salmtal and Sehlem (Kr Wittlich) on the Koblenz-Trier railway line, both of which are some 5 km away from Klausen. Wittlich‚Äôs main railway station, some 15 km away from Klausen, is the nearest long-distance station. It can be reached by bus with only one transfer to route 301 or 305 at the Wittlich bus station, and the trip takes, depending on where one transfers, between 20 and 87 minutes.

It is the second oldest zoological garden in the world (after Tiergarten Sch√∂nbrunn). Today it does not have very large animals like elephants, but a lot of rare smaller and medium-sized mammals and a variety of birds and reptiles.  The location  The zoo is located directly by the Seine in the centre of Paris. It takes up about one third of the Jardin des Plantes.  From herb garden to menagerie  = The botanical garden = In the beginning the term Jardin des Plantes referred only to a botanical garden of , created and built by the royal physicians Jean Herouard and Guy de La Brosse. It therefore became known as the royal herb garden. Created in 1626 and opened for the public in 1635, it is the oldest part of the national research and educational institute for science, the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle, which was founded in 1793. = The foundation of the menagerie = Animal artists at the Jardin des Plantes, Paris. From the magazine L'Illustration, 7 August 1902. In the course of the French Revolution the menagerie was founded in 1793. According to a decision of the National Assembly in 1793, exotic animals in private hands were to be donated to the Menagerie in Versailles or killed, stuffed and donated to the natural scientists of the Jardin des Plantes. However, the scientists let the animals (the exact number of which is unknown) live. In due course the Royal Menagerie in Versailles (m√©nagerie royale) was dissolved and these animals were also transferred to the Jardin des Plantes. Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (1737‚Äì1814) is considered to be the founder of the menagerie. He was committed to the principles of keeping exotic animals in their natural environment, having regard to their needs, placing them under scientific supervision, and allowing public access in the interest of public education. The Jardin was free for all visitors and tourists right from its inception. While the menagerie at first was just provisional it grew in the first three decades of the 19th century to be the largest exotic animal collection in Europe. The Zoo was under the scientific leadership of the former head of the zoological department at the museum, √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772‚Äì1844). From 1805 onwards the menagerie was under the leadership of Fr√©d√©ric Cuvier, who was replaced in 1836 by Geoffroy's son Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire.  Research  The institutional incorporation of the menagerie within the National Research Institute of the National Natural History Museum facilitated the academic study of the animals by doctors and zoologists. Studies related to systematics, morphology and anatomy were all carried out, notably by Georges Cuvier. √âtienne Geoffroy, Fr√©d√©ric Cuvier (the brother of Georges Cuvier) performed research in the area of behavioral observation. √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Fr√©d√©ric Cuvier published their results in the quarterly work Histoire des Mammifi√®res. It was first published in 1826 and became one of the foundational books concerning the biology of exotic animals. Furthermore, F. Cuvier's plans regarding the breeding of new domestic animal species were formulated.  Attractions and species growth  Plan of the M√©nagerie du Jardin des plantes, Paris, France. Pallas's cat at the zoo The expanding range of species was chiefly the result of French travelling researchers, colonial officials and donations from private people, which accounts for the fact that the animals in the Jardine were not limited to local French species. The so-called Rotonde was added to the basic enclosures in 1804, and from 1808 was used to harbour large animals such as elephants. In 1805 the bear ditch followed and in 1821, a so-called Fauverie or predator enclosure. The Volieren enclosure (voleries, birdhouses) for diurnal birds of prey was added in 1825, and two years later a birdhouse specifically for pheasants. A monkey house was set up for the first time in 1837, while reptiles had to wait until 1870 for their enclosure. Most animals were kept in functional, classicist, gallery-like buildings. These buildings and the zoo itself can be seen as an expression of the Imperial Power of France. In another part was the Vall√©e Suisse which had been built as a romantic garden. Here were several small enclosures which held exotic animals such as antelopes. Some buildings from this period still exist today - the semicircular birdhouse for pheasants (1827), the reptile house and the new pheasants enclosure (1881). At the beginning of the 20th century a hibernation enclosure (1905), a small monkey house (1928), a vivarium (1929), another monkey house (1934) and a reptile house (1932) had been built. A half century passed after this improvement without any further innovations except the restoration of the bear pit and some technical corrections. A new enclosure for diurnal birds of prey was built in 1983. A variety of renovations were carried out in the 1980s. At the beginning of the 21st century the pheasants enclosure from 1881 was renovated. However, as all of the structures are listed buildings, it is almost impossible to create new structures here. However the Jardin des Plantes still exists today and is the second oldest civil zoo in the world.

Early Life  Born in the tiny village of Paraiso De Osorio , La Paz department, El Salvador, to Vicente and Maria Soriano Rosales as the third child of seven. Despite his father's effort to have his male children help in the farm, his mother, a school teacher, insisted that all their children obtain an education and made all efforts to ensure that they obtained at least a high school education, having to send all children to a larger town, Cojutepeque, to achieve that. Showing interest to enter the military at the age of fifteen, his parents worked hard to enroll him into the country's military academy, despite being of little means.  Service in the military  On February 2, 1941, he joined the academy, as one of 124 new recruits. However, by July, his parents could no longer afford his tuition but his stay at the academy was assured when he received one of the two scholarships that were being granted to the new recruits. Around Rub√©n's first year at the academy he was befriended by Colonel √ìscar Osorio, who was the sub-director of the academy and would later be a member of the Revolutionary Council governing the country (1948-1950) and eventually President of the Republic (1950-1956).On April 2, 1944, while on military leave working the family farm, a rebellion to overthrow President Maximiliano Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez broke out, he reported to the Cojutepeque garrison for duty and was one of two cadets from the entire academy who saw military action against the rebellion. Later that year, he was introduced to a cadet recruit's sister, Maria Garay, daughter of Colonel Eduardo Garay, who would become his wife three years later. They would have four children. On July 1945, he along with twelve others from the original 124, graduated as commissioned officers. He was assigned to the artillery regiment, known as El Zapote, (now a military museum) in the nation's capital, across from the Presidential House. On December 14, 1948, being the commander on duty at the strategic location across the Presidential house for that day, he was enlisted to participate in a rebellion to overthrow President Salvador Castaneda Castro. The rebellion proved successful and brought an old friend, Coronel √ìscar Osorio, into a governing position in the country. From February, 1950 to February, 1953, he was one of two Salvadorean officers to receive a scholarship from the Mexican government to attend the Escuela Superior de Guerra in Mexico City. Upon his return to El Salvador, he served in the Military Academy but eventually returned to El Zapote as the third in command. By this time, the artillery regiment had become the most elite of the armed forces in the nation. In 1957-1958, as a delegate of the Armed Forces, he joined the entourage of President Jos√© Mar√≠a Lemus in many of his official trips throughout Latin America. In 1958, he was promoted to second in command of El Zapote. Major Arturo Armando Molina, who later became President of the Republic (1972-1977) was his replacement as third in command. In 1960, in large part due to the strategic position of the elite regiment across the Presidential House, he was enlisted to play a part in the overthrow of President Jos√© Mar√≠a Lemus. Coronel √ìscar Osorio was instrumental in the planning of the overthrow. Upon the successful overthrow, Major Rosales was named one of the six-man government that took control of the country. The junta ruled from October 26, 1960 to January 25, 1961, when it was subsequently overthrown by another coup and replaced by the Directorio Civico- Militar.  Post-Military  Sent into exile, Rub√©n Alonso Rosales, ended in Mexico, where he had befriended many military officers from the Mexican Army a decade earlier, who assisted him for a few months. Returning to El Salvador at the end of 1961, he was allowed to stay in the country, but the government in power, suspecting that he was fomenting a rebellion, strongly recommended that he leave the country for his own safety. The Salvadorian government arranged for his immigration to the United States in September, 1962. Rub√©n Alonso Rosales settled in Los Angeles area, he worked for a furniture moving company until 1985, when he retired.

All the lines were either solely owned by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) or jointly by the GNR and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;). The terrain was extremely challenging for railway construction, and the lines were very expensive to build. The lines were * the Halifax and Ovenden Junction Railway,There were other variations on the name. opened from 1874; * the Bradford and Thornton Railway, opened in stages from 1876; * the Halifax, Thornton and Keighley Railway from Holmfield to Queensbury and from Thornton to Keighley, opened in stages from 1878; * the Halifax High Level Railway, opened from 1890, but closed to passengers in 1917.. For some time the network was busy, both for passengers and goods, but carryings declined steeply, and passenger services were discontinued in 1955. Goods traffic ceased in 1974. The lines were marked with a number of major civil engineering works including several viaducts and tunnels. A feature of the line was the unusual station at , which was on a triangular track layout, with two platforms on each of the three chords. Background The Queensbury lines in 1884 West of Bradford, the Pennine terrain rises steeply to a plateau around above sea level, with numerous steep-sided valleys: an area of exceptional difficulty for railways. Nevertheless it included a large area of Yorkshire with active industries, not well served by road transport. Halifax and Ovenden Junction Railway North Bridge, Halifax carrying the road over the former line The first Halifax station on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway was opened in 1844.Marshall, page 60 The main station, opened later, is approached from the north-east by a tunnel: it is located at the bottom of the town, which is hilly. From 1854 the Great Northern Railway had running powers to Halifax over the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway.Whitaker and Cryer, page 6 Both the L&YR; and the GNR were concerned about the difficulty of carting goods to and from the higher-lying districts, as well as congestion at the station itself. The Ovenden valley, north-west of the town, was a significant source of traffic, and a branch line there would potentially assist.Bairstow, page 4 A company was formed in 1863 to build a railway along the Thornton valley, to connect Halifax with Keighley. At the time this was considered to be a very ambitious project, and during its time in Parliament, the scheme was much reduced in scope, to connect Halifax and Holmfield through the Ovenden Valley. It was to be titled the Halifax and Ovenden Junction Railway, and it was incorporated on 30 June 1864, with capital of ¬£90,000. The GNR and L&YR; each subscribed ¬£30,000 towards the capital, and were to work the line jointly.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 162Awdry, page 217Carter, page 362 Queensbury tunnel Construction of the line was much delayed; there was an Act of 12 August 1867, permitting a doubling of the authorised capital, some deviations of the route, and an extension of time. Nevertheless the depressed state of the money market meant that the scheme lay dormant until a further Act was obtained on 1 August 1870, sanctioning a second extension of time, and vesting the undertaking jointly in the GNR and L&YR.; The concern was then renamed the Halifax and Ovenden Joint Railway. Soon afterwards, construction began from a junction with the L&YR; at the north end of Halifax station, for to . The steepest gradient was 1 in 45 and the sharpest curve was radius. A masonry viaduct carried the line through Halifax, with 35 spans which varied from . A short distance beyond that, the line crossed another viaduct of 11 spans which varied from . There were two tunnels, North Bridge () and Lee Bank (). Earthworks were heavy, with high retaining walls. Goods depots were opened at North Bridge and Holmfield.Wrottesley, volume 2, page 18 The line opened for goods between Halifax and on 17 August 1874, to Holmfield on 1 September 1874, and was opened to passengers throughout on 1 December 1879. Bradford and Thornton Railway Disused tunnel on the City Road branch Thornton, West Yorkshire was an important industrial centre, and in 1865 separate proposals were advanced by the L&YR; and the GNR for lines to Thornton, but they were rejected by Parliament. During 1870 local businessmen put forward a scheme for a railway from Bradford to Thornton via Clayton and Queensbury; this would connect industrial locations hitherto not served by railways. The project had already been cut back in scope from an earlier project to reach Keighley, on the grounds that such a line would be unaffordable, due to the difficult terrain.Whitaker and Cryer, page 7 The GNR agreed to sponsor the reduced scheme and subscribe half the capital; the GNR was partly motivated by the belief that the rival Midland Railway would step in, getting access to Halifax, if the GNR held back. Accordingly the Bradford and Thornton Railway Act was passed on 24 July 1871,Grant refers to the company as the Bradford and Thornton Railways.Carter, page 404Grant, page 63 sponsored by the GNR, and the undertaking was transferred to and vested in the GNR by Act of 18 July 1872.Bairstow, page 6Awdry, page 120 The authorised construction was of line between St Dunstan's, Bradford, and Thornton. The junction at St Dunstan's was to be a triangle joining the existing GNR connecting line between Hammerton Street Junction and the Mill Lane Junction, approaching the L&YR; Exchange station: this would allow direct running towards the L&YR; station and also towards Laisterdyke and Leeds. (There were to be no platforms on this west-to- east side of the triangle.) In addition there was to be a short branch to Brick Lane, on the west side of Bradford, where a goods station was to be established, named City Road. An important object of the Bradford and Thornton Railway was to provide railway facilities for Queensbury, home of the important Black Dyke Mills, run by John Foster. The town is at an altitude of above sea level. The weaving industry had flourished in this inhospitable location because of coal supplies in the immediate area; these were originally plentiful but there were now fears that the deposits were nearing the end of their life. Construction and opening: Bradford to Thornton Work started in the Bradford to Thornton line on 21 March 1874. The earthworks were heavy, and construction was slow. The first section to be opened was from the St Dunstan's junctions at Bradford as far as Great Horton on 4 December 1876. The short branch line to City Road goods depot opened on the same day; both openings were for goods traffic only.Whitaker and Cryer, page 10 The short extension to Clayton followed on 9 July 1877Bairstow, page 64 or on 9 August 1877. The next stage was dependent on completion of Clayton Tunnel and Thornton Viaduct; opening for goods from Clayton to Thornton was on 1 May 1878. The line was opened throughout from Bradford to Thornton to all traffic on 14 October 1878. Thornton Viaduct crossed the Pinch Beck valley. The viaduct is long and rises from the valley floor. It was built of brick and stone quarried locally and the central piers were sunk underground to the foundations. Each of its 20 arches are of span. It is still (2019) standing. The initial passenger service was five trains each weekday from Bradford Exchange to Thornton and two from , giving Leeds connections (and avoiding the use of the L&YR; station). The opening of St Dunstan's station in January 1879 meant that Leeds connections were available there, and the Laisterdyke trains were soon taken off, while the Bradford service was increased. Although the line passed through Queensbury, there was no station there at first; a temporary structure was built, to the east of the later East Junction on 14 April 1879.Whitaker and Cryer, page 70 It had no goods facilities, and was reached only by a primitive and unmade footpath.Bairstow, page 10 The improved station, with platforms on all three curves of the triangular layout, opened later, on 1 January 1890.Whitaker and Cryer, page 22 Halifax, Thornton & Keighley Railway Hewenden Viaduct In 1864 and again in 1867 moves were made independently (seeking Midland Railway support) for a rail link between Huddersfield, Halifax and Keighley, but these were unsuccessful. In 1872 another attempt was made, but the Midland Railway was implacable in refusing to assist. The GNR also rebuffed the promoters at first, and they decided to go it alone; however on 23 December 1872 agreement was reached. The GNR would not support a line from Halifax to Huddersfield, (which was now finally dead), but undertook to adopt the proposal as between Halifax and Keighley, if the independent supporters would find half the cost. The GNR's financial commitment was ¬£640,000.Joy, pages 90 to 94 The Great Northern Railway (Halifax, Thornton & Keighley Railway) Act was passed on 5 August 1873.Awdry, page 136 The route was to start from the almost-completed Halifax and Ovenden line at Holmfield, and join the Bradford and Thornton Railway at Queensbury, making a triangular junction there. It would then extend that line from Thornton on to Keighley. There was to be a separate terminus at Keighley near the Midland station, but this was later changed.Bairstow, page 8Grant, page 252 Between Queensbury and Holmfield the and Strines cutting caused even greater difficulties with water-bearing strata than had the tunnel, and held up opening of this section to passengers until 1 December 1879. Construction and opening: Holmfield to Queensbury Between Holmfield and Queensbury the line was almost entirely within Queensbury Tunnel or the massive Strines Cutting. Considerable trouble was encountered with water-bearing strata during construction. Goods trains started running on 14 October 1878, the same day that Thornton station opened to passengers. In 1878 the GNR was in serious financial difficulty on capital account, and invited the Midland Railway to join in the Keighley line works, but the Midland refused. Passenger trains began to run from Bradford to Halifax on 1 December 1879. Initially they ran nonstop after Queensbury but a temporary station was provided at within a fortnight. North Bridge station opened on 25 March 1880, and Ovenden station in June 1881. The Halifax to Holmfield section remained in joint ownership with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. Both companies ran goods trains but the GNR alone provided the passenger service. Queensbury was not reached from Ovenden until late 1879, the line opening for goods traffic on 1 December and to passenger services two weeks later when temporary platforms at Holmfield were brought into use. Two temporary platforms at Queensbury had been in use for several months for Bradford-Thornton trains and completion of the long- awaited Halifax route gave the station a great deal of importance on account of its junction status. Initially, a daily service of six trains each way was provided between Bradford and Halifax.Whitaker and Cryer, page 11 Contractors started boring the Queensbury Tunnel on 21 May 1874; this was to be the longest tunnel on the GNR until the opening of Ponsbourne Tunnel near Hertford in 1910. Four streets of temporary houses were built in Queensbury for the construction workers; although supposedly temporary, the buildings were not condemned until 1957. The tunnel work was completed on 31 July 1878. Construction and opening: Thornton to Keighley Cullingworth Viaduct Work on the ¬£282,000 Thornton to Keighley section was proving exceptionally difficult and progress was slow. The most serious problems were encountered on the stretch between Denholme and Wilsden where repeated landslips frustrated progress with construction. The intention had been for the line to pass through a series of cuttings, but the persistence of these earth slips forced the GNR to substitute two short tunnels. Goods trains began running from Thornton to Denholme on a single track alignment from 1 September 1882, or 3 September.Whitaker and Cryer, page 12 Passenger operation to started on 1 January 1884. The line was opened to Keighley goods depot on 1 April 1884, but the joint passenger station at Keighley was not ready. From 7 April 1884 GNR passenger trains were extended to ; the train service was eight trains a day. Finally, on 1 November 1884 passenger trains began running from Bradford and Halifax to Keighley Joint station. There were 18 GNR trains each weekday and four on Sundays. The station had cost ¬£80,000, and in fact was not completed until the following spring.Carter, page 423 Keighley station In 1880, the GNR applied for Parliamentary sanction to reduce its financial liability for the Thornton to Keighley line on which work was about to begin. It approached the Midland Railway with a proposal to make a joint station at Keighley, to be used by the Midland Railway main line trains, the Worth Valley line trains, and the GNR. The Midland Railway were amenable to this, and by an agreement of 1 June 1881, the Midland granted the GNR the necessary running powers, and agreed to make a new junction station. The agreement was in exchange for the Midland getting running powers to Halifax. The northernmost part of the Worth Valley branch was relaid and doubled; the agreement marked the start of a more amicable relationship between the GNR and the Midland. Powers for the new Keighley station and for the widening of the last part of the Worth Valley line were granted by an Act of 1882. Although agreement had been reached about a shared station, goods facilities at Keighley were kept entirely separate: the GNR built a spur line off the Worth Valley route just outside Keighley station; the spur crossed under and entered its own goods yard. Queensbury station The town of Queensbury was the most important on the route. However the high altitude of the town made it impossible for the railway to get close to it; the distance from the town to the station was downhill along an unsurfaced and unlit footpath; the difference in altitude was about . When the line opened in 1878 there was no station at Queensbury until a temporary structure was hastily made ready for Easter 1879; it was located east of the East Junction. It had no goods facilities, no access for vehicles and the only footpath was unmade and unlit. There was repeated pressure from the Queensbury Local Board to improve the access, but the GNR delayed. In 1885 a report was considered, which showed that it would be possible to construct a new station with platforms on all three sides of the triangular junction. Remarkably a railway connection to the town was considered: either a rope-worked incline at a gradient of 1 in 6, or a slightly more conventional locomotive-worked line, following a roundabout route. The latter would cost twice as much: it would be in length with a maximum gradient of 1 in 30. Work started on the new station in 1889 and a road to the town was included in the plans. The station opened on 1 January 1890 and the road came into use soon afterwards. The railway connection schemes were quietly forgotten. Train services Queensbury station operated as an interchange point, making useful local connections. At certain times of the day trains stood on all three sides of the triangle allowing connections to be made in all directions. In 1910 there were 22 weekday departures from Bradford Exchange to Halifax or Keighley. In most cases the destination not served by a direct train could be reached by changing at Queensbury. There were 21 trains from Halifax for the Queensbury line and 16 starting from Keighley. On Sundays nine trains left Bradford Exchange for Halifax or Keighley. The journey from Bradford to Halifax by this route took between 35 and 40 minutes depending on the number of stops and the duration of the wait at Queensbury. This was slower than by the alternative Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway service, which was more frequent. A Great Northern train from Bradford to Keighley took 45 minutes, twice as long as the faster trains by the Midland Railway from Forster Square. Some traffic was lost to the electric tramways after the turn of the century. The Bradford trams began to eat into the traffic at stations as far as Thornton, whilst Ovenden, Holmfield and Queensbury became prey to the Halifax tramways. Because of the breaks of gauge, trams were not a threat on longer journeys in the West Riding, but when motor buses were operating in later years, the threat was considerable. Halifax High Level Railway Tower blocks and the Wheatley viaduct In 1884 an ambitious plan was authorised, to make a north to south railway through Halifax connecting Holmfield to the planned Hull and Barnsley Railway at a Central Station in George Square, Halifax. In addition there would be a local branch to St Paul's, also in the high level part of Halifax. The Huddersfield part of the project was abandoned as too expensive, and the railway was authorised as the Halifax High Level & North & South Junction Railway on 7 August 1884.Carter, page 460Grant, page 251 The Hull and Barnsley Railway was unable to complete its planned lines and by an Act of 1886, the Halifax High Level Railway was reduced to the Holmfield to St Paul's section. Authorised capital was ¬£360,000. The line would be worked jointly by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the Great Northern Railway, although the L&YR; only ran goods trains on the route.Bairstow, page 41 The line opened for goods as far as Pellon on 1 August 1890 and to all traffic throughout on 5 September 1890. The timetable was generally arranged so that the High Level train arrived at Holmfield to change there for Bradford. In 1910 there were 11 departures from St Paul's Mondays to Fridays, 12 on Saturdays and five on Sundays. A steam railmotor was given a trial on the branch about 1906 but did not find favour, possibly because of the gradients. The High Level Company was absorbed jointly by the L&YR; and GNR by an Act of 3 July 1894;Whitaker and Cryer, page 16 a clause in the Act obliged them to build a goods station at Wheatley. The branch was steeply graded and heavily engineered with an tunnel at Wheatley, approached at both ends by deep cuttings. There was a ten-arch viaduct across the Hebble Valley. St Paul's and Pellon Stations served a well- populated area of Halifax but the train service was of little value to anybody travelling south or west from Halifax. By 1898 electric trams had been introduced serving both St Paul's and Pellon. The High Level passenger service was temporarily closed at the end of 1916 because of the demand for manpower in the war effort. In fact the passenger service never resumed, though there were occasional excursions during the 1920s and 1930s. The track was singled and most of the signalling removed. The main value of the High Level line was for freight. St Paul's was at an altitude about higher than the Old Station, and the slow and roundabout route was not significant to goods traffic; there were numerous mills and factories in the upper part of Halifax, and goods traffic continued until 27 June 1960. Queensbury tunnel problem Defects were discovered in the sidewalls of Queensbury tunnel, and urgent repairs were carried out from January to September 1883. Single-line working through the tunnel was instituted to enable the work to proceed. Normal working was able to resume on 9 September 1883 and no further problems were encountered. Decline and closure Sunday trains were withdrawn in December 1938, but otherwise the timetable showed a continuing good service. In 1950 the timetable was recast to give a better peak-hour service to and from Bradford but with fewer off-peak trains and a reduction in direct trains between Halifax and Keighley. St Dunstan's and stations closed in September 1952, and less than three years later, the entire passenger service was withdrawn. In May 1956 the sections between Queensbury and and between and were closed to all traffic. This saved the cost of maintaining Queensbury and Lees Moor Tunnels and divided the route into three separate branch lines which were then operated with reduced signalling. The remaining operation was progressively cut back over the next 18 years. Holmfield and the High Level closed in 1960, Cullingworth in 1963, Thornton and Ingrow in 1965. The last remnants were from St Dunstan's to Horton Park and City Road which survived until 1972. City Road had been reduced to a coal depot on 5 June 1967.Whitaker and Cryer, page 17 Halifax to North Bridge coal yard closed in 1974. The Hewenden and Cullingworth Viaducts survive.Bairstow, page 13 Close to ¬£1 million had been spent on building the Queensbury lines, and it is doubtful if the expenditure was ever really justified. Advantages of the Bradford‚ÄìHalifax section were to a considerable extent nullified by the 1882 GNR‚ÄìL&YR; agreement, while the Bradford‚ÄìKeighley route was too steeply graded to compete with the Midland's low-lying line along the Aire Valley. At first the GNR provided the fastest service from Keighley to London in 4 hours 55 minutes by a Keighley‚ÄìBradford train, stopping only at St Dunstan's to connect with a King's Cross express. A service from Halifax avoided St Dunstan's by using the Leeds curve to connect with London trains at . After a brief heyday the routes settled down to concentrate on purely local traffic, and even this diminished when trams started running from both Bradford and Halifax to Queensbury in 1901. Buses caused a further reduction in traffic in the late 1920s and Sunday trains were withdrawn in December 1938, but by 1946 the service was still surprisingly lavish with one through coach working to King's Cross, running from Halifax to Bradford in 22 minutes. It was only after a survey showed the line was losing ¬£48,000 a year that regular passenger trains were withdrawn on 23 May 1955. All lines west of Horton Park were completely closed by 1965, and those east of this point followed suit in 1972. Queensbury and Lees Moor tunnels were abandoned in 1956 owing to their poor state of repair.Whitaker and Cryer, page 41 The line was cut back to Thornton on 11 November 1963 and the entire section west of Horton Junction closed from 28 June 1965. Horton Park Yard and the Cty Road branch survived until August 1972.

The character is featured in the Marvel Universe, and is commonly associated with Spider-Man. He first appeared in Spider-Man #70. Fictional character biography When the Kingpin (Wilson Fisk) lost control of New York's underworld, crime lord Don Fortunato filled the power void; but his son, Giachomo \\"Jimmy-6\\" Fortunato, disapproved of his family's methods and tried to quit organized crime just as his father's plans were coming to fruition. Enraged, Don Fortunato demands his son's death. On the run, Jimmy-6 pushes Ben Reilly (a clone of Peter Parker) away from a barrage of bullets intended for him; as Spider-Man, Reilly returns the favor later by rescuing Jimmy-6 from an assassination attempt. Although the wounded Jimmy-6 wants nothing to do with Spider-Man, he reluctantly accepted Reilly's offer to hide out at his apartment.Spider-Man Volume 1 #70-71 Hoping that Jimmy-6 could still be persuaded to return, Don Fortunato orders that he be captured rather than killed. Shortly after meeting Reilly's \\"cousin\\" Peter Parker, Jimmy-6 learns of an alliance of rival crime lords formed by gangster Hammerhead which plans to assassinate Don Fortunato. Jimmy went to warn his father of the planned hit, only to learn that Don Fortunato has formed an alliance with the HYDRA terrorist organization to defeat his rivals.Spider-Man Volume 1 #73 In a small ceremony, Fortunato reveals he has kidnapped civilians from each of the territories of the attending crime lords. Jimmy-6 learns the civilians are to be executed as an example of what would happen in case of disobedience. Horrified, Jimmy pulls a gun on his own father. The attendees wait and see what happens. Don Fortunato disowns Jimmy right there on stage. Spider-Man - then Ben Reilly - and Daredevil help rescue the civilians but need help themselves when they are cornered near an exit. Jimmy-6 flies in on an attack helicopter, killing the men threatening the group and carrying the heroes and civilians away to safety.Spider-Man Volume 1 #74 Later, Jimmy-6 learns the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn) has killed Ben Reilly, and vows to avenge his friend's death.Extra pages of Peter Parker: Spider-Man Volume 1 #75 Wounded by enemies of his father in Forest Hills, Queens, Jimmy-6 seeks refuge at the nearby Parker residence, where he stops an assassin sent by the Green Goblin.Peter Parker: Spider-Man Volume 1 #86-87 He then departs. When Spider- Man (Peter Parker) was suspected of murdering street thug Joey Z, Jimmy-6, feeling he owes Spider-Man his life, saves him from vigilantes trying to collect the $5 million bounty placed on Spider-Man's head.Peter Parker: Spider-Man Volume 1 #89 Soon after, Jimmy-6 shot a new Green Goblin (a genetic creation employed by Osborn), although the Goblin's armor saved him. Several vigilantes sought the bounty on Jimmy's head afterward, but the Punisher (Frank Castle) and government mercenary Shotgun (J.R. Walker) save him.The Spectacular Spider-Man Volume 1 #255 When the Kingpin returns to claim his criminal empire, Jimmy-6 challenges him and rejoins the Fortunato crime cartel, replacing his incapacitated father (allegedly hospitalized by Kingpin). Trying to stop the bloodshed, Jimmy-6 reaches an agreement with the Kingpin. Peter Parker is caught photographing a secret meeting between Jimmy and the Kingpin, but Jimmy lets Parker go due to his \\"relationship\\" to Ben Reilly. After one of Jimmy's men accidentally knocks over the Kingpin's high- stakes poker game, New York erupts in a gang war between rival underworld faction. When Jimmy and his family are caught in a crossfire involving Kingpin's Enforcers (Fancy Dan, Montana, & Ox), Spider-Man's intervention enables Jimmy to escape, and he later helps Jimmy defeat the Enforcers in Jimmy's penthouse. Jimmy-6's current status is unknown now that Don Fortunato has regained his health and control of the cartel, but it was confirmed that Jimmy-6 had somehow made peace with his father, as Fortunato briefly refers to him as \\"My Beautiful Giacomo,\\"Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #7 showing no signs of ill will. With Angelo dead after as short term as the second Venom, Jimmy-6 is in all probability the sole heir to Fortunato's crime empire. Powers and abilities Composed almost entirely of muscle, Jimmy-6's massive frame grants him peak human strength and resists many penetration wounds. He is a skilled strategist and electrical engineer, having designed the Fortunato estate's security systems. A veteran of two tours of duty with the U.S. Army, he is an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, firearms user, and helicopter pilot. In other media In the first iteration of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, the show was narrated by the Geek Chorus, Spider-Man fans who were in the process of writing the most extreme and ultimate Spider-Man story ever.

Geography  = Location = The municipality lies surrounded by vineyards, meadows and forests in the natural and cultivated landscape of the Moselle valley not far from the university city of Trier. M√ºlheim is found on the river‚Äôs right bank, where the valley begins to broaden out into country marked by even slopes on the banks and by former riverbeds. The village lies at the foot of a small, narrow mountain, a former river island surrounded by an old riverbed of the Moselle that has now been cut off from the mainstream. This is planted all round with grapevines and is purportedly the only mountain in Europe wholly given over to winegrowing. M√ºlheim belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Bernkastel-Kues, whose seat is in the like-named town. = Nearby municipalities = Neighbouring municipalities are, among others, Brauneberg and Lieser. The nearest middle centres are the double town of Bernkastel-Kues, some 4 km away, and the district seat, Wittlich, some 12 km away. Trier is some 33 km away. = Climate = M√ºlheim lies in a transitional zone between temperate oceanic climate and continental climate; compared to other regions in Germany, a very warm and sunny climate prevails here. In neighbouring Brauneberg on 11 August 1998, a record temperature of 41.2 ¬∞C in the shade, the highest ever air temperature recorded in the Federal Republic, was confirmed at the Meteomedia weather station by J√∂rg Kachelmann (however, Brauneberg is not said to be Germany‚Äôs number-one hotspot because the weather station is not included in official measurements owing to its location on a slate mountain). The barrier formed by the Eifel shields M√ºlheim from west winds, putting it in a rain shadow and sometimes subjecting it to a f√∂hn effect. At the same time, the warming of the air is favoured by the only slight exchange of air with the surrounding area. Tied in with this is the high humidity due to ongoing evaporation of water from the Moselle, which, especially in summer, makes at times for heavy and muggy weather, and which also brings many storms along with it.  History  Schloss Veldenz, a few kilometres from M√ºlheim In nearby areas, remnants of human habitation have been found from the Bronze Age, as have the ruins of a flight castle, the Heidenmauer (‚ÄúHeathen Wall‚Äù), which is found a few kilometres away from M√ºlheim, behind Schloss Veldenz. As early as about 500 BC there came settlement by the Treveri, a people of mixed Celtic and Germanic stock, from whom the Latin name for the city of Trier, Augusta Treverorum, is also derived. From about 50 BC until sometime about AD 500 came the Romans. After the collapse of Roman hegemony, the area around M√ºlheim was taken over by the Salian Franks, which their king, Childebert II, eventually donated to Bishop Agericus of Verdun. Episcopally installed princes from the Nahegau made themselves ever more independent and beginning in 1129 bore the title Count. Thereafter, M√ºlheim was part of the County of Veldenz, although after both the first and second comital families had died out, the County passed first to the new Principality of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken and eventually in 1694 through inheritance to Electoral Palatinate. In 1752 in Burgen, not far away, the notorious robber, Johann Peter Petri, known as ‚ÄúSchwarzer Peter‚Äù (‚ÄúBlack Peter‚Äù), the outlaw Schinderhannes‚Äôs henchman, was born. Until 1795, M√ºlheim belonged to Bavaria.  Politics  = Municipal council = The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. Bavarian coat of arms from 1835 with the Lion of Veldenz. It also depicts: the Palatine Lion, the Franconian Rake and the Margraviate of Burgau as well as the Bavarian lozenges in the inescutcheon. These arms held their place until the end of the monarchy. The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"300\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"   Bottler  Falke  Fehres  Total - align=\\"center\\"  2009  7  5  4  16 seats } = Coat of arms = Coat of arms of M√ºlheim The municipality‚Äôs arms might be described thus: Argent a lion rampant azure armed Or and langued gules holding between his sinister fore gambe and dexter hind gambe a waterwheel of the third. The two charges in the arms are the blue (\\"azure\\") Lion of Veldenz with a red tongue (\\"langued gules\\") and gold claws (\\"armed Or\\"), along with a special municipal symbol, the golden waterwheel. The tinctures gules and Or (red and gold) were taken from the heraldic beast on the helm of the arms borne by the old County of Veldenz. In 1835, the lion in M√ºlheim's arms was adopted by the King of Bavaria into that kingdom‚Äôs state coat of arms, where it remained as a charge until the end of the First World War when the last Bavarian king, Ludwig III was forced to abdicate as a result of the November Revolution.  Culture and sightseeing  = Regular events = Local history and wine festivals are held regularly in M√ºlheim. The highlight is the M√ºlheimer Markt, a market and court day established by the Counts in 1555, today a wine festival marked with a parade, market stalls and a midway. The M√ºlheimer Markt is not held on a weekend, but rather each year between the first Tuesday and Thursday in August. Nevertheless, it is in no way inferior to other wine festivals in the Verbandsgemeinde of Bernkastel-Kues and draws a good number of visitors.  Economy and infrastructure  Winegrowing and also tourism play an important r√¥le. A local supply of food is guaranteed. The winemaking village also has a landing stage from which boat tours are available. Moreover, several ‚ÄúFirst- Class Hotels‚Äù (that is, four-star, under the German hotel classification system) have arisen in M√ºlheim to meet the high demand. Public transport is integrated into the Verkehrsverbund Region Trier (VRT), whose fares therefore apply, and which also includes, besides Trier, the districts of Bernkastel- Wittlich, Bitburg-Pr√ºm, Vulkaneifel and Trier-Saarburg.

It is the episcopal seat of the Diocese of Verona. It was erected after two Palaeo-Christian churches on the same site had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1117. Built in Romanesque style, the cathedral was consecrated on September 13, 1187. The structure was later modified by several renovation interventions, although the plan has remained unchanged. Exterior The fa√ßade is divided into three parts, with a pediment and a two storied projecting porch or protiro embellished with sculpture, which is the work of the twelfth-century sculptor Nicholaus, who also executed and signed the entranceway at the abbey church of San Zeno, also in Verona, and Ferrara Cathedral. The portico is supported on the backs of two griffins, similar to those from the dismantled Porta dei Mesi at Ferrara. The lunette depicts the Virgin holding the Christ child in high relief, centered between two low relief scenes, the Annunciation to the Shepherds (left) and the Adoration of the Magi (right). On the lintel in medallions are the three theological virtues, Faith, Charity and Hope. Ten figures of prophets are set in the doorposts and jambs; the four symbols of the Evangelists and the Hand of God are set above in the barrel vault of the first story of the porch. Set into the walls on either side of the portal are figures of Roland and Oliver, who as holy warriors, remind one of the constant need to provide protection to the church. The Gothic windows in the facade provide evidence of the renovation that took place in the 14th century. The Baroque addition at the upper part of the facade is part of 17th-century additions. On the south side of the church is a second portal executed in the so-called Lombard or Como style. The main apse has retained its integrity and as such is an example of mid-12th-century architecture. The bell tower, begun in the 16th century by Michele Sanmicheli and left unfinished, has two orders of columns with highly decorated capitals, bas-reliefs and traces of 14th-century frescoes. It contains nine bells in the scale of A. The tenor weight is 4566 kg. The bells are rung with the tradition of Veronese bellringing art. Interior The current appearance of the interior dates from the 15th-century renovations. It has a nave and two aisles divided by tall pilasters in red Verona marble, which support Gothic arcades. The first three chapels on each side are in the same style, and house mostly Renaissance artworks by Veronese artists. The nave ends with the main Chapel (Cappella Maggiore), also by Sanmicheli.  Library  The Chapter Library of Verona Cathedral (Biblioteca Capitolare della Cattedrale di Verona) is one of the world's oldest libraries in continuous function. Such is its importance that it has been dubbed the ‚ÄúQueen of ecclesiastical collections‚Äù. Many ancient works of the Classical tradition have survived only because of the Chapter Library, including: *the only surviving corpus of Catullus (Verona Codex, now lost); *the epistulae ad Atticum, ad Quintum, ad Brutum by Cicero, rediscovered by Petrarch (exemplar now lost); *the Institutes of Gaius, overwritten with works of Saint Jerome, rediscovered by Barthold Niebuhr; *the fasti consulares of Verona, a list of Roman consuls from 439 to 494; *the Laterculus Veronensis, a list of Roman dioceses; It holds also important early Christian writings, such as: *the Leonine Sacramentary, the oldest liturgical book of the Roman Rite; *the Verona Palimpsest, containing early Church Orders; *the Codex Veronensis, containing an old version of the Latin Psalter; *the Codex Veronensis (R) is a diglot psalter in Greek and Latin The following signature in a life of Saint Martin of Tours by a scribe is usually considered to mark the conventional dating of the founding of the Library: ‚Äúmy name is Ursicinus, Lector of the Church of Verona‚Äù, confirming that he finished the work in the consulship of Agapitus (517).

On 5 February 1136, Stephen reached Durham with an imposing troop of Flemish mercenaries, and the Scottish king was obliged to negotiate. Stephen recovered Wark, Alnwick, Norham and Newcastle, and let David I retain Carlisle and a great part of Cumberland and Lancashire, alongside Doncaster. The English king asked the Scottish king to make him oath of allegiance, but David had already sworn one with his niece Empress Matilda, heir to Henry I from whom Stephen had usurped the throne. David I asked his son Henry, to make the oath, in return for which he was made Earl of the Honour of Huntingdon and Northampton which up to that point had been held by his father. In 1138, David invaded the North of England again, leading to the Battle of the Standard and the Treaty of Durham (1139).

The municipality‚Äôs arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Azure a bend argent charged with three roses gules seeded Or, above which a cramp palewise of the second, in a chief of the second a cross of the third. The red cross in the chief is the armorial bearing once borne by the Electorate of Trier, which was once the village‚Äôs landholder. The bend (slanted stripe) charged with the three roses is the arms borne by the noble family ‚Äúvon Platten‚Äù, also known as ‚ÄúHaich von Platten‚Äù, whose seat was Castle Neuerburg near Wittlich. This composition is handed down through Paul von Platten‚Äôs seal (from 1390) and a colour drawing in Archbishop Balduin‚Äôs book of documents, the so-called Balduineum, for Richard von Platten, who in 1326 was enfeoffed with Castle Neuerburg by this Archbishop. The cramp (double-ended hook, called a Forsthaken, or ‚Äúforest hook‚Äù, in the German blazon, but often called a Wolfsangel, or ‚Äúwolf‚Äôs hook‚Äù, in blazons for other German coats of arms that bear this charge) came from the arms borne by the noble family Plait (or Platten), whose ancestral seat was in Platten and who, owing to their holdings in Longuich sometimes called themselves ‚ÄúPlait von Longuich‚Äù.

It is the location of the like-named castle, now in ruins.  Geography  = Location = The municipality lies on a 250 m-high ridge sloping down from the Hunsr√ºck to the Moselle on the river‚Äôs right bank, downstream between Traben-Trarbach, the Ahringsbach valley and Enkirch. Towards the north, the village is bordered by a castle crag, where a few remnants of walls from the Starkenburg (castle) can still be discerned. Starkenburg is surrounded by unbroken greenbelt characterized by vineyards, woods, meadows and farms. Starkenburg belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Traben-Trarbach, whose seat is in the like-named town.  History  The Romans were already using this place‚Äôs strategic location, in which they built a fort. The Roman fortification of the heights was a forerunner to the later castle. The complex is believed to have been destroyed by the Franks about 412. In the Middle Ages, Starkenburg was from 1125 the residence of the County of Sponheim for the ‚ÄúHinder‚Äù County; in 1350 it was relieved of this function by the newly built Grevenburg. The Sponheim noble family first appeared on the Moselle, according to documents, with Count Meginhard I of Sponheim in Enkirch in 1125. The first documentary mention of the castle as ‚ÄúStarkenberg‚Äù (not ‚ÄúStarkenburg‚Äù), in a directory of landholdings from Trier, comes from 1200. The castle became well known in the 14th century because of the bold and dynamic Countess Loretta, Count Heinrich II‚Äôs young widow. Her great adversary was the eminent Archbishop and Elector of Trier Baldwin of Luxembourg, who would gladly have brought the bothersome ‚Äúforeign body‚Äù within his Electorate that was the County of Sponheim under his sway. Countess Loretta, irreverently and boldly, had the great Baldwin taken prisoner in 1328 during a voyage on the Moselle and locked him up at her stronghold of Starkenburg in ‚Äúhonourable‚Äù detention. Neither the threats of Baldwin‚Äôs nephew the Emperor nor the Pope‚Äôs anathema could move the young and, it is said, attractive Countess to release the Archbishop. He was finally let go after having paid a high ransom and made sweeping political concessions, which itself led to further questions about his stay at Starkenburg. According to legend, the ransom was later used to build the Countess‚Äôs new dwelling ‚Äì a ‚Äúwidow‚Äôs seat‚Äù ‚Äì called Frauenburg () near Frauenberg [sic] on the river Nahe. About 1350, the Grevenburg in Trarbach became the seat of the Counts of Sponheim. In 1558, the Reformation was enforced throughout the Sponheim domains. The wars that came in the French Revolution‚Äôs wake swept the County of Sponheim away. At the Congress of Vienna, Starkenburg was annexed to Prussia. Since 1947, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.Ortsgeschichte auf der offiziellen Webseite (Zugriff 17.

But in the spring of 1139, Stephen was to face another problem when Empress Matilda, decided to retake the crown of England usurped by Stephen after the death of Henry I of England, landed in England. This marked the beginning of the English civil war known as The Anarchy. Stephen, not wishing to face several forces at once had to make concessions with the Scottish king.

Because the new turboprops were much lighter than the radial engines, they had to be mounted far forward to maintain the plane's center of gravity specifications. The replacement engines increased the aircraft's cruising speed from 170 mph to 215 mph. The prototype was later converted into the Conroy Tri-Turbo-Three. The second Turbo Three was called the Super Turbo Three because it was converted from a surplus Super DC-3. Unlike the first conversion, the Dart engines were mounted in the rear part of the engine nacelle. Due to the small diameter of the Viscount propellers, airflow was restricted by the bulky nacelles and landing gear fairings. This caused the takeoff distance to be 6000 feet, making it unappealing as a commuter aircraft. The aircraft ended up parked at Groton-New London Airport in Groton, Connecticut where on February 19, 1984 its cockpit was hit by a wing from a Trans American Lockheed L-100 Hercules. A similar conversion had been performed for British European Airways (BEA) in the 1940s when a Dakota was converted to Dart power in order to obtain turboprop experience prior to the introduction of the Viscount.

Gale, 2007 Whiteside started with the Kansas City Kansan in 1959. He moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin where he covered the Milwaukee Braves as well as civil rights issues. Team owner Bud Selig offered Whiteside a job with the Milwaukee Brewers when the franchise relocated from Seattle in 1970, but he preferred to continue working in journalism. In 1971, Whiteside started The Black List to help sports editors find qualified black journalists to hire. Initially The Black List only had nine names, but by 1983 it had expanded to more than 90.AP via the Houston Chronicle, \\"Larry Whiteside, 69, black sports journalist\\" ‚Äì June 15, 2007 Career in Boston He moved to Boston in 1973 where he worked for most of his career.

It incorporates hip hop, reggae and African traditional musical styles. The lyrics are in Swahili, Sheng or local dialects. It is associated with the Ogopa Deejays and is believed to have originated in the late 1990s with artists such as Redsan, Bebe Cool and Chameleone. It went on to dominate East African airwaves (especially Kenya and Uganda) after the release of the Ogopa Deejays' first album in 2001, which included artists such as the late E-Sir, Nameless, Mr. Lenny, Amani, Mr. Googz and Vinnie Banton amongst others. The over-saturation of playlists with this music style caused some to criticise it, including the artists K-South who had a hit titled \\"Kapuka This, Kapuka That\\". This also led to other styles such as genge music being formed by producer Clemo to diversify the market. Despite the critics the music continues to be very popular in Kenya although more so now in Uganda. Of late, \\"genge\\" has also come to refer more generally to boomba and \\"kapuka\\" music. VEGATONE VEGATONE/NAXVEGAS MUZIK is a genre of hip hop/Afro Dancehall music that originated from the town of Nakuru or colloquially Naks/NaxVegas as many youths call it. The music is a blend of indigenous kapuka mixed with a reggae baseline. It is characterized by very flashy Musicians who mainly rap and sing about their sexual escapades and the number of women that they keep, but cipher their language to avoid being explicit. Vegatone has evolved in recent times. Artists in this genre include award-winning artist Teferah who has numerous hits having worked with Nyanda from Brick and Lace on the song \\"Put It On Me\\" produced in Romania by Tommo records, and getting signed to an American music label Mpact Muzik in 2017. Teferah is seen as a break-through artist in this genre. Other Vegatone artists are Rhonda Bwoy, Skymer,Juss Nera, Hush BK, Avril,Vivian,K-FRESH,Igiza,Obako,Mavo,77 and many more. Nakuru is credit for creating the viral sounds of Gengetone which uses the slang used in Nakuru and most Gengetone producers are from Nakuru Sadafa,Mavo on the beat,Duboiz,Samba on the beat,Andah water and other creatives that fuse Vegatone arrangements.Vegatone is a common sound especially on Kenyan and local nakuru radios highly popularized by Radio presenter Caleb Koyo.

A left-hander, he was listed as tall and . A native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, he attended the University of Michigan, and in 1988 he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Powell was a third-round selection by Cincinnati in the 1989 Major League Baseball Draft. He was called up by the Reds at the end of his fifth professional season and debuted on September 5, 1993, against the Philadelphia Phillies, when he threw two innings of one-hit relief. In his second appearance, six days later against the Montreal Expos, Powell took the mound for one of his four career starting assignments. He allowed two earned runs and three hits in four innings, and left for a pinch hitter with the Reds trailing, 2‚Äì1. He was charged with the loss in an eventual 4‚Äì2 Montreal victory. Powell then absorbed two more losses in relief over the season's last month. In April 1994, Powell was traded to Houston in a deal for catcher Ed Taubensee. He spent much of that year at Triple-A, but made 12 appearances in relief in June and August for the Astros. He faced 32 batters in only 7 innings pitched, but was effective: although he allowed six hits and five bases on balls, he surrendered only one earned run, for a 1.23 ERA. That MLB season was curtailed by a players' strike on August 12, one day after Powell, pitching against the San Diego Padres, surrendered the earned run. The 1995 season started late because of the strike. Powell made seven relief appearances for Houston between April 27 and May 13, but was treated harshly, allowing ten hits, eight bases on balls and nine earned runs in five innings pitched. He returned to Triple-A for six weeks, then was recalled by the Astros in July. His effectiveness returned, as he allowed two earned runs in four innings pitched and eight appearances. Then, on July 28, his contract was sold to the Pirates. After four appearances out of the Pittsburgh bullpen, Powell was given three starting assignments in mid-August by Pirate manager Jim Leyland. He received no-decisions against the Florida Marlins on August 19 and the Colorado Rockies on August 24, before losing a return match against Colorado on August 28. He then returned to the bullpen for the remainder of the year, his last in the majors. Throughout his MLB career Powell played in 48 games, with four starts. He never collected a big- league win and ended his career with a 0‚Äì5 win-loss record. In 53 innings pitched, he gave up 52 hits, 32 bases on balls, and 32 earned runs. He struck out 42. His professional baseball career lasted for eight seasons (1989‚Äì96). Two decades after leaving baseball, Powell, 49, who had opened a lawn-care company, was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his business's van in Lucas, Texas, a suburb of Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth. His 72-year-old father, Lyle, also perished in the October 25, 2017, incident.

The entire film was refused a certificate by the British Board of Film Censors in 1954, and has never been released in the UK.BBFC database - I Vinti The French episode had trouble with French censorship, and was not released until 1963. The English-language episode is loosely based on the murder of 48 year old Mrs Mabel Tattershaw by Herbert Leonard Mills, aged 19. Wanting to commit the \\"perfect murder\\", on 3 August 1951 Mills lured Tattershaw to Sherwood Vale, where he struck her about the head, and strangled her. He then returned home and waited for the body to be discovered. When this had not happened by 9 August he rang the News of the World, told them he had found the body of a strangled woman, and demanded payment for his story. Mills was quickly implicated, tried for the crime, and found guilty. He was executed on 11 December 1951. A report by the Nottingham Evening Post of Mills's arrest for the crime is shown on screen during the narrated introduction to the film, amongst others from across Europe reporting crimes by youths, including John Straffen.

This article will focus on density-dependence in the context of macroparasite life cycles. Positive density-dependence Positive density-dependence, density-dependent facilitation, or the Allee effect describes a situation in which population growth is facilitated by increased population density. =Examples= For dioecious (separate sex) obligatory parasites, mated female worms are required to complete a transmission cycle. At low parasite densities, the probability of a female worm encountering a male worm and forming a mating pair can become so low that reproduction is restricted due to single sex infections. At higher parasite densities, the probability of mating pairs forming and successful reproduction increases. This has been observed in the population dynamics of Schistosomes. Positive density-dependence processes occur in macroparasite life cycles that rely on vectors with a cibarial armature, such as Anopheles or Culex mosquitoes. For Wuchereria bancrofti, a filarial nematode, well- developed cibarial armatures in vectors can damage ingested microfilariae and impede the development of infective L3 larvae. At low microfilariae densities, most microfilariae can be ruptured by teeth, preventing successful development of infective L3 larvae. As more larvae are ingested, the ones that become entangled in the teeth may protect the remaining larvae, which are then left undamaged during ingestion. Positive density-dependence processes may also occur in macroparasite infections that lead to immunosuppression. Onchocerca volvulus infection promotes immunosuppressive processes within the human host that suppress immunity against incoming infective L3 larvae. This suppression of anti-parasite immunity causes parasite establishment rates to increase with higher parasite burden. Negative density-dependence Negative density- dependence, or density-dependent restriction, describes a situation in which population growth is curtailed by crowding, predators and competition. In cell biology, it describes the reduction in cell division. When a cell population reaches a certain density, the amount of required growth factors and nutrients available to each cell becomes insufficient to allow continued cell growth. This is also true for other organisms because an increased density means an increase in intraspecific competition. Greater competition means an individual has a decreased contribution to the next generation i.e. offspring. Density- dependent mortality can be overcompensating, undercompensating or exactly compensating. There also exists density-independent inhibition, where other factors such as weather or environmental conditions and disturbances may affect a population's carrying capacity. An example of a density-dependent variable is crowding and competition. =Examples= Density-dependent fecundity Density-dependent fecundity exists, where the birth rate falls as competition increases. In the context of gastrointestinal nematodes, the weight of female Ascaris lumbricoides and its rates of egg production decrease as host infection intensity increases. Thus, the per-capita contribution of each worm to transmission decreases as a function of infection intensity. Parasite-induced vector mortality Parasite-induced vector mortality is a form of negative density-dependence. The Onchocerciasis life cycle involves transmission via a black fly vector. In this life-cycle, the life expectancy of the black fly vector decreases as the worm load ingested by the vector increases. Because O. volvulus microfilariae require at least seven days to mature into infective L3 larvae in the black fly, the worm load is restricted to levels that allow the black fly to survive for long enough to pass infective L3 larvae onto humans. In macroparasite life cycles Density- dependence processes (red) in filariasis life cycle In macroparasite life cycles, density-dependent processes can influence parasite fecundity, survival, and establishment. Density-dependent processes can act across multiple points of the macroparasite life cycle. For filarial worms, density- dependent processes can act at the host/vector interface or within the host/vector life-cycle stages. At the host/vector interface, density- dependence may influence the input of L3 larvae into the host's skin and the ingestion of microfilariae by the vector. Within the life-cycle stages taking place in the vector, density-dependence may influence the development of L3 larvae in vectors and vector life expectancy. Within the life-cycle stages taking place in the host, density-dependence may influence the development of microfilariae and host life expectancy. In reality, combinations of negative (restriction) and positive (facilitation) density-dependent processes occur in the life cycles of parasites. However, the extent to which one process predominates over the other vary widely according to the parasite, vector, and host involved. This is illustrated by the W. bancrofti life cycle. In Culex mosquitoes, which lack a well-developed cibarial armature, restriction processes predominate. Thus, the number of L3 larvae per mosquito declines as the number of ingested microfilariae increases. Conversely, in Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes, which have well-developed cibarial armatures, facilitation processes predominate. Consequently, the number of L3 larvae per mosquito increases as the number of ingested microfilariae increases. Implications for parasite persistence and control Negative density- dependent (restriction) processes contribute to the resilience of macroparasite populations. At high parasite populations, restriction processes tend to restrict population growth rates and contribute to the stability of these populations. Interventions that lead to a reduction in parasite populations will cause a relaxation of density-dependent restrictions, increasing per-capita rates of reproduction or survival, thereby contributing to population persistence and resilience. Contrariwise, positive density- dependent or facilitation processes make elimination of a parasite population more likely. Facilitation processes cause the reproductive success of the parasite to decrease with lower worm burden. Thus, control measures that reduce parasite burden will automatically reduce per-capita reproductive success and increase the likelihood of elimination when facilitation processes predominate. =Extinction threshold= The extinction threshold refers to minimum parasite density level for the parasite to persist in a population. Interventions that reduce parasite density to a level below this threshold will ultimately lead to the extinction of that parasite in that population. Facilitation processes increase the extinction threshold, making it easier to achieve using parasite control interventions. Conversely, restriction processes complicates control measures by decreasing the extinction threshold. Implications for parasite distribution Anderson and Gordon (1982) propose that the distribution of macroparasites in a host population is regulated by a combination of positive and negative density-dependent processes. In overdispersed distributions, a small proportion of hosts harbour most of the parasite population. Positive density-dependent processes contribute to overdispersion of parasite populations, whereas negative density-dependent processes contribute to underdispersion of parasite populations. As mean parasite burden increases, negative density-dependent processes become more prominent and the distribution of the parasite population tends to become less overdispersed. Consequently, interventions that lead to a reduction in parasite burden will tend to cause the parasite distribution to become overdispersed. For instance, time-series data for Onchocerciasis infection demonstrates that 10 years of vector control lead to reduced parasite burden with a more overdispersed distribution.

(80 c, d). male very bright blue, with a metallic gloss like enamel, black margin to the forewing and black distal-marginal spots to the hindwing, these spots contrasting strongly with the pure white fringes. Female brown, sometimes with yellowish red distal-marginal spots. Underside strongly recalling icarus, but male as well as female with distinct white median streak on the hindwing. In the higher mountains of southern Europe as far as the Alps, and in the mountain-districts of Anterior Asia. ‚Äî In ab. petrividenda Favre the hindwing beneath has no black marginal spots, but instead a white band before the margin, ab. albipicta Schultz has a white discocellular spot on the forewing above instead of the hardly visible black one. ab. caerulescens Oberth. (80 d) are females with bright blue upperside, which occur singly and rarely in Europe, but are said to be a constant form in West China; this, however, is very improbable, and Leech says nothing about it. ‚Äî erotides Stgr.

Biography Among connoisseurs of classical music Herman Makarenko is well known as the Ukrainian conductor - philosopher, who gave a new lease of classical music from different eras due to his tireless work. Herman Makarenko was born on 29 June 1961 in the city of Lviv in the family of musical theater artists. Beginning his study at the Kiev music specialized school named after Mykola Lysenko (the part of the National Music Academy of Ukraine) in 1976 (in those days - State Conservatory), Herman graduated from the piano faculty of this Academy in 1986. In 1985, during his study, he became a student of conducting faculty of the Department of opera and symphony conducting. Among the mentors who had a great influence on the formation and fate of a young musician were national actors of Ukraine Roman Kofman and Oleg Ryabov, and principal conductor of the National Opera of Ukraine - Stephen Turchak. It was he who in 1987 invited, then a young intern at the Opera House, where Herman, as well as all new conductors, went through all the stages of formation - from assistant-trainee to the lead conductor. He has toured with various symphony orchestras and opera theaters around the world, including United States, Canada, France, Italy, Belgium, Serbia, Czech Republic, Croatia, Macedonia, Slovakia, Iran, Cyprus, Russia and others. Headed by Herman Makarenko \\"Kyiv-Classic\\" Symphonic Orchestra has been widely recognized in Ukraine as well as abroad. High professional status of the collective in many aspects supported by his exclusive music projects, including \\"Concert Premiere\\", \\"New Year‚Äôs Strauss Concert\\", \\"Declaration of love\\". The program of the orchestra includes a large number of works by composers of different eras and nations. The musical compositions by Ukrainian composers such as S. Gulak-Artemovsky, N. Lysenko, V. Gubarenko, M. Skoryk, E. Stankovich, M.Chemberdzhi, I. Shcherbakov, Y. Shevchenko etc. take a special attention in the creative portfolio of \\"Kyiv-Classic\\" Orchestra. Maestro Makarenko efficiently combines an active conductor's practice activities with the theoretical comprehension of the philosophical and aesthetic essence of the musical art form, the phenomenon of the complex and multifaceted problem of creativity and, in particular, the creativity of opera and symphony conductor. The writing of his PhD thesis \\" The Irrational Aesthetics of the 19th Century: The Musical Point\\" became the consequence of symbiosis of theory and practice, the defense of which was held at the Philosophical Faculty of Kyiv National Taras Shevchenko University (May 2000), and Doctoral thesis - \\"Creativity in the context of a conductor‚Äôs integrative approach \\", the defense of which was held at the National Music Academy of Ukraine (June, 2006).

Currently the international standard ICAO requires a 90m (300 feet) RESA starting from the end of the runway strip (which itself is 60m from the end of the runway), and recommends but not requires a 240m RESA beyond that. In the U.S., the recommended RSA may extend to in width, and beyond each runway end (according to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration recommendations; 1000 feet is equivalent to the international ICAO-RESA of 240m plus 60m strip). The standard dimensions have increased over time to accommodate larger and faster aircraft, and to improve safety. Historical development In the early years of aviation, all airplanes operated from relatively unimproved airfields. As aviation developed, the alignment of takeoff and landing paths centered on a well defined area known as a landing strip. Thereafter, the requirements of more advanced aircraft necessitated improving or paving the center portion of the landing strip. The term \\"landing strip\\" was retained to describe the graded area surrounding and upon which the runway or improved surface was constructed. The primary role of the landing strip changed to that of a safety area surrounding the runway. This area had to be capable, under normal (dry) conditions, of supporting aircraft without causing structural damage to the airframe or injury to the occupants. Later, the designation of the area was changed to \\"runway safety area,\\" to reflect its functional role. The runway safety area enhances the safety of aircraft that undershoot, overrun, or veer off the runway, and it provides greater accessibility for firefighting and rescue equipment during such incidents. One of the difficulties is that overshooting aircraft do not always run off the end of the runway at relatively slow speed; they leave from the side of the runway (as in the TAM Brazilian Airlines Flight 3054 accident), they run off the end at such a high speed that they would overrun any safety area (as in the Air France Flight 358 accident in Toronto), or they land well short of the runway (as in the British Airways Flight 38 accident at Heathrow). Recent changes in the United States The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recognized that incremental improvements inside standard RSA dimensions can enhance the margin of safety for aircraft. This is a significant change from the earlier concept where the RSA was deemed to end at the point it was no longer graded and constructed to standards. Previously, a modification to standards could be issued if the actual, graded and constructed RSA did not meet dimensional standards as long as an acceptable level of safety was provided. Today, modifications to standards no longer apply to runway safety areas. Instead, FAA airport regional division offices are required to maintain a written determination of the best practicable alternative for improving non-standard RSAs. They must continually analyze the non-standard RSA with respect to operational, environmental, and technological changes and revise the determination as appropriate. Incremental improvements are included in the determination if they are practicable and they will enhance the margin of safety. Warnings in Canada After the Air France Flight 358 accident in Toronto, Ontario, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada recommended changes to the runway safety areas on runways at Canadian airports. TSB suggest that airports employ EMAS (engineered material arresting system) on Canadian runways by constructing a 300 m (as per ICAO standard of 60 m + 240 m or FAA 300 m) overrun at the end of all runways. TSB advises runway changes in light of Air France crashNTSB Final report 2007-12-12, Retrieved 2007-12-13 The EMAS can be of benefit where the aircraft leaves the runway neatly at the end, and there are several clear examples where it saved an aircraft from a serious accident. All EMAS are tailor fitted to a specific runway, allowing them to offer the best performance within the available area.

Most used two-stroke engines made by either J.A.P. or Precision, but there were also 225cc and 296cc engines designed and manufactured by Ivy. The company also made its own suspension forks, carburettors and sidecars. The company was heavily involved in motorcycle racing, with several of the Newman brothers entering races themselves. The race bikes were kept as standard wherever possible to demonstrate the build quality and specification of the production machines. The Newman brothers believed that this was the best way to prove their designs and advertise their products. H. C. Newman was especially successful, winning many local events and finishing well in the Isle of Man TT races several times. Models Various different models were made during the company's existence. These included: *Ivyette: This had a 2 ¬º horsepower Valveless 224 cc two-stroke Ivy engine. Designed to be a cheap and reliable vehicle for getting around town. Powered by the Ivy engine. *Model C: This had a 2 ¬Ω horsepower Precision engine.

The Act is far-reaching, providing for the admissibility of previous convictions in support of a propensity to commit like-offences and untruthfulness. Common law rules in relation to the admissibility of bad character evidence have been abolished, with the existence of one exception. The legislation draws heavily on the Law Commission Paper No. 273. Definition Bad character evidence is evidence of, or a disposition towards misconduct; other than evidence which has to do with the alleged facts of the offence with which the defendant is charged or is evidence of misconduct in connection with the investigation or prosecution of that offence. Misconduct is defined as \\"the commission of an offence or other reprehensible behaviour\\". Bad character in relation to the alleged facts offence itself has always been admissible for obvious reasons. The Act provides for different rules in relation to the bad character of defendants, and that of non-defendants. In assessing the probative value of evidence it is assumed to be true, unless there is material to suggest the contrary. Apart from evidence of previous convictions, other evidence, amounting to \\"reprehensible behaviour\\" is admissible. The Government stated the following during debate: :\\"Examples of where it might be appropriate to admit such evidence include circumstances where evidence on a number of charges being tried concurrently is cross- admissible in respect of the other charges. :It might also be appropriate to admit evidence relating to charges on which the defendant was acquitted, as I have already cited in the example of. It would be unfortunate if an argument were to be accepted that, because a person has not actually been convicted of the offence, it cannot be said that the evidence shows that he has indeed committed such an offence and it is therefore excluded\\". Exclusion of bad character evidence In addition to the statutory tests for exclusion of bad character evidence the power to exclude evidence under section 78 PACE 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 is not affected by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provisions (House of Lords, Hansard, 19 November 2003, Col. 1988). Bad Character evidence may be excluded on the grounds of unfairness.

It was the first iteration of the third generation of this Australian-made model and also included the Ford Fairmont (XA)‚Äîthe luxury- oriented version of the Falcon. Overview Sold between March 1972 and September 1973, the XA series was the first Falcon to be designed (with assistance from Ford's US headquarters) and manufactured in Australia.Pedr Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 129 It featured an entirely new body which was larger and more roomy than that of its XY series predecessor, giving it the \\"coke-bottle\\" look. The XA range also had a longer list of options, although the choice of engines carried over from the previous XY Falcon range. All V8 302 CID and most 351 CID \\"Cleveland\\" engines were now Aussie made. GT Falcons could have Aussie or imported 351 CID V8s fitted.Ford Falcon XA Retrieved from www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au on 25 April 2010 Wagons, utilities and panel vans now featured a longer wheelbase than the sedan. Fairmont wagons had a dual-action tailgate that could be opened either downwards or sideways, optional on base model Falcon and Falcon 500 Wagons. The addition of a two- door hardtop to the range marked the first time that this body style had been offered on an Australian Falcon since the XP series of 1965‚Äì1966.Norm Darwin, The History of Ford in Australia, 1986, page 167 The hardtop's longer doors with frameless windows were shared with the utility and van, with a different shape glass to suit the commercial vehicles' body apertures. The shorter doors of the sedan and wagon with their framed windows were also available with optional quarter vent windows, though these were very rare, mainly fitted to cars in the hotter parts of Australia. This option was available in the subsequent XB and XC models, though very scarce. The XA Falcon range were the first Falcons fitted with in-dash vents for face level flow-thru ventilation, although they only worked while the car was in motion. A total of 129,473 XAs were built. While successful, the XA Falcon range proved to be short-lived as it gained a significant frontal appearance update to become the XB series in September 1973.

It also shared many options as used on the GT Falcon, such as the 12 slot steel wheels with plain brushed centre caps, the three spoke wooden rimmed steering wheel with rim squeeze horn and full GT dash instrumentation featuring tachometer, odometer, oil pressure, water temperature and voltmeter as standard. For the first time the GS model range was also available as a two- door hardtop and was also offered as an option on utes and panel vans.

Production of the required 200 examples was abandoned in July 1972 following intense media and political pressure, and only one production example was completed.Stewart Wilson, Ford Falcon, Mustang, Sierra, 1993, pages 36-38Australian Muscle Car, Issue 20, page 41 This significant road car was manufactured in Calypso Green metallic with a white vinyl interior, and has recently been completely restored. Additionally, three regular production Falcon GT sedans - especially painted in Brambles Red - had been in the process of being developed for racing to GT-HO specification by Ford Special Vehicles Division and were to be raced at Bathurst in 1972 by factory drivers Allan Moffat and Fred Gibson. With the abandonment of the XA Falcon GT-HO as a production car, development was immediately halted on the three race cars and they were sold off. However, one of these cars did go on to serve a life in motorsport, specifically as a rally car campaigned by Bruce Hodgson. It was later destroyed in a road accident. Although the three cars featured standard Falcon GT compliance plates, they are considered by most Ford fans to be race-prepared versions of the XA Falcon GT-HO Phase IV. Howard Marsden, head of Lot 6, designated the race cars as follows XA-1 Alan Moffat (Carthew); XA-2 Gibson (Bowden); XA-3 (Hodgson). =Falcon GT - RPO 83= Between April 1973 and August 1973, Ford Australia built 250 XA Falcon GTs fitted with the RPO 83 package, 130 of these being sedans and 120 being hardtops.Mark Oastler, RPO 83 - Ford's secret Falcon GT, Australian Muscle Car, Issue 20, July/Aug 2005, pages 40-79 RPO 83 comprised three variations from the standard XA Falcon GT, these being of a Holley 780 carburettor, 2.25 inch exhaust headers and a clutch slave cylinder hydraulic pipe heat shield. Pricing and external appearance did not vary from the standard models. The 2.25 inch exhaust headers were subsequently homologated for the XA Falcon GT for Group C Touring Car racing, including the 1973 Hardie-Ferodo 1000. = Falcon 500 Superbird - RPO 77= Ford XA Falcon 500 Superbird Hardtop.

Recent DNA fingerprinting suggests that it is a cross between Gouais blanc and Pinot, the same ancestry as Chardonnay. The name Auxerrois blanc has actually been used as a synonym for Chardonnay in the Moselle region in France, which explains why there is also a longer name (Auxerrois Blanc de Laquenexy) for the grape variety.

Free Run Cellars in Berrien county, Michigan (southwest MI) is now producing it (2018) =Canada= In Canada, Auxerrois is grown on Vancouver Island in British Columbia where it is successfully blended with another cold climate grape Ortega (Dragonfly Hill Vineyard) and Chardonnay (a Bacchus blend by Alderlea Vineyards). It is also produced as a varietal wine in the Okanagan wine country by five or six different producers, but most notably Gray Monk Vineyards, just north of Kelowna, who were responsible for bringing the grape over from Alsace in the 70's. In Ontario, the Essex Region wineries Viewpointe Estate) and Oxley Estate produce varietal Auxerrois, and Pelee Island Winery blends Auxerrois with Chardonnay. Ch√¢teau des Charmes winery was the first to plant Auxerrois in the mid 1980s. = United Kingdom = A few vineyards in the United Kingdom grow Auxerrois, notably Davenport Vineyards, Danebury Vineyard and a'Becketts Vineyard. Auxerrois is used to produce still and sparkling wines, often blended with other varieties.

Kyburg Jr. (1928‚Äì2007) was Gideon Burbank Professor of Moral Philosophy and Professor of Computer Science at the University of Rochester, New York, and Pace Eminent Scholar at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, Pensacola, Florida. His first faculty posts were at Rockefeller Institute, University of Denver, Wesleyan College, and Wayne State University. Kyburg worked in probability and logic, and is known for his Lottery Paradox (1961). Kyburg also edited Studies in Subjective Probability (1964) with Howard Smokler. Because of this collection's relation to Bayesian probability, Kyburg is often misunderstood to be a Bayesian. His own theory of probability is outlined in Logical Foundations of Statistical Inference (1974), a theory that first found form in his 1961 book Probability and the Logic of Rational Belief (in turn, a work closely related to his doctoral thesis). Kyburg describes his theory as Keynesian and Fisherian (see John Maynard Keynes and Ronald Fisher), a delivery on the promises of Rudolf Carnap and Hans Reichenbach for a logical probability based on reference classes, a reaction to Neyman‚ÄìPearson statistics (see Jerzy Neyman, Karl Pearson, and Neyman‚ÄìPearson lemma), and neutral with respect to Bayesian confirmational conditionalization. On the latter subject, Kyburg had extended discussion in the literature with lifelong friend and colleague Isaac Levi. Kyburg's later major works include Epistemology and Inference (1983), a collection of essays; Theory and Measurement (1984), a response to Krantz‚ÄìLuce‚ÄìSuppes‚ÄìTversky's Foundations of Measurement; and Science and Reason (1990), which seeks to allay Karl Popper's and Bruno de Finetti's concerns that empirical data could not confirm a universally quantified scientific axiom (e.g., F = ma). Kyburg was Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1982), Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Science (1995), Fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (2002), and recipient of the Butler Medal for Philosophy in Silver from Columbia University, where he received his PhD with Ernest Nagel as his advisor. Kyburg was also a graduate of Yale University and a 1980 Guggenheim Fellow.http://www.gf.org/fellows/8279-Henry-E-Kyburg Kyburg owned a farm in Lyons, New York where he raised Angus cattle with his wife, Sarah, and promoted wind turbine systems for energy-independent farmers. Philosophical relatives Several full professors of philosophy today were once undergraduates of Henry Kyburg, including Daniel Dennett, Robert Stalnaker, Rich Thomason, Teddy Seidenfeld, and William L. Harper. His AI dissertation students were Ronald Loui, Bulent Murtezaoglu, and Choh Man Teng, and postdoctoral visitor Fahiem Bacchus. His philosophy students included daughter Alice Kyburg, Mariam Thalos, Gregory Wheeler, William Harper, Abhaya Nayak, Prashanta Bandyopadhaya, in addition to those listed above. Theory of probability Several ideas distinguish Kyburg's Kyburgian or epistemological interpretation of probability: *Probability is measured by an interval (some mistake this as an affinity to Dempster‚ÄìShafer theory, but Kyburg firmly rejects their rule of combination; his work remained closer to confidence intervals, and was often interpreted by Bayesians as a commitment to a set of distributions, which Kyburg did not repudiate) *All probability statements can be traced to direct inference of frequency in a reference class (there can be Bayes-rule calculations upon direct-inference conclusions, but there is nothing like a prior distribution in Kyburg's theory) *The reference class is the most specific class with suitable frequency knowledge (this is the Reichenbach rule, which Kyburg made precise; his framework was later reinterpreted as a defeasible reasoning system by John L. Pollock, but Kyburg never intended the calculation of objective probabilities to be shortcut by bounded rationality due to computational imperfection) *All probability inferences are based on knowledge of frequencies and properties, not ignorance of frequencies; however, randomness is essentially the lack of knowledge of bias (Kyburg especially rejects the maximum entropist methods of Harold Jeffreys, E.T. Jaynes and other uses of the Principle of Indifference here; and Kyburg disagrees here with Isaac Levi who believes that chance must be positively asserted upon knowledge of relevant physical symmetries) *There is no disagreement over the probability once there is agreement on the relevant knowledge; this is an objectivism relativized to an evidential state (i.e., relativized to a set of observed frequencies of properties in a class, and a set of asserted properties of events) Example: Suppose a corpus of Knowledge at a level of acceptance. Contained in this corpus are statements, e is a T1 and e is a T2. The observed frequency of P among T1 is .9. The observed frequency of P among T2 is .4. What is the probability that e is a P? Here, there are two conflicting reference classes, so the probability is either [0, 1], or some interval combining the .4 and .9, which sometimes is just [.4, .9] (but often a different conclusion will be warranted). Adding the knowledge All T1's are T2's now makes T1 the most specific relevant reference class and a dominator of all interfering reference classes. With this universal statement of class inclusion, the probability is [.9, .9], by direct inference from T1. Kyburg's rules apply to conflict and subsumption in complicated partial orders. Acceptance and principles of rational belief Kyburg's inferences are always relativized to a level of acceptance that defines a corpus of morally certain statements. This is like a level of confidence, except that Neyman‚ÄìPearson theory is prohibited from retrospective calculation and post- observational acceptance, while Kyburg's epistemological interpretation of probability licenses both. At a level of acceptance, any statement that is more probable than the level of acceptance can be adopted as if it were a certainty. This can create logical inconsistency, which Kyburg illustrated in his famous lottery paradox. In the example above, the calculation that e is a P with probability .9 permits the acceptance of the statement e is a P categorically, at any level of acceptance lower than .9 (assuming also that the calculation was performed at an acceptance level above .9). The interesting tension is that very high levels of acceptance contain few evidentiary statements. They do not even include raw observations of the senses if those senses have often been fooled in the past. Similarly, if a measurement device reports within an interval of error at a rate of .95, then no measurable statements are acceptable at a level above .95, unless the interval of error is widened. Meanwhile, at lower levels of acceptance, so many contradictory statements are acceptable that nothing useful can be derived without inconsistency. Kyburg's treatment of universally quantified sentences is to add them to the Ur-corpus or meaning postulates of the language. There, a statement like F = ma or preference is transitive provides additional inferences at all acceptance levels. In some cases, the addition of an axiom produces predictions that are not refuted by experience. These are the adoptable theoretical postulates (and they must still be ordered by some kind of simplicity). In other cases, the theoretical postulate is in conflict with the evidence and measurement-based observations, so the postulate must be rejected. In this way, Kyburg provides a probability-mediated model of predictive power, scientific theory-formation, the Web of Belief, and linguistic variation. The theory of acceptance mediates the tension between linguistic categorical assertion and probability-based epistemology.

Opened in 1883 by The Lydd Railway Company, it closed to passengers in 1937. Part of the line which served the station is converted to the main access road as a means of transporting atomic waste from nearby Dungeness nuclear power station.  History  Dungeness was the terminus of the Lydd Railway Company's branch from Appledore which opened on 7 December 1881. Passenger services initially terminated at Lydd, although a goods service operated as far as Dungeness. The line was opened throughout to passengers as from 1 April 1883. A second branch was opened the following year from a point just south of Lydd to New Romney. The railway terminated almost at the foot of Dungeness lighthouse (1901) where very basic facilities were provided in the shape of a single platform on which was perched a small arched roof weather- boarded shed comprising a ticket office, waiting room and ladies and gents toilets. A run-round loop was provided to facilitate engine reversals and a siding led to the lighthouse.Subterranea Britannica, \\"Dungeness\\". The promoters of the line had hoped that linking Dungeness, one of the largest expanses of shingle in the world, with London by rail would lead to its development as a port from which cross-channel steamers could operate to the small French fishing port of Le Tr√©port, 60 miles distant and 114 miles from Paris. Proposals to construct a harbour at Dungeness had been around since the 1870s and received support from South Eastern Railway chairman Edward Watkin; the inexhaustible supply of shingle could, if dug out, have been used for track ballast and to form the basin of what could have been one of the most cheaply built dock systems in the world. The development of Dungeness failed to materialise and the South Eastern Railway, which had taken over the Lydd Railway Company in 1895, was left with two short branch lines in a remotely populated area, with the Dungeness branch carrying the lightest of traffic; shingle did provide some traffic, including flints for the Potteries which used them to provide glaze on china. The line survived for a further fifty years, aided somewhat by holiday camp development along the coast which prompted the Southern Railway (which had taken over the line upon the railway grouping of 1923) to realign the New Romney branch closer to the sea (approximately 1¬º miles towards Dungeness) in 1937. The realignment coincided with the closure of Dungeness branch to passengers, leaving it open for goods until May 1953. To make up for the closure of Dungeness, the Southern Railway opened a new station at Lydd-on-Sea (¬Ω mile away) whose running in board read \\"Lydd-on-Sea (for Dungeness)\\".Harding, P.A., op. cit. p. 14.  Present day  The Dungeness branch remains open from Appledore to sidings on the site of the old Romney Junction where the original branch to Dungeness left the line to New Romney. Atomic Waste is taken one mile by road from the Dungeness Power Station and is transported away by rail. About half mile of the trackbed of the branch has been converted into the main access road to Dungeness power station. Another half mile section is walkable towards the site of Dungeness station which is approximately 50 yards to the west of the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway's own Dungeness station. As at 2017 the station site and trackbed is still undeveloped with degraded remains of the clinker and timber platform after years of coastal erosion. The small shelter building has now gone, but its concrete base can still be seen. Many of the shacks scattered around the southern end of Dungeness arrived in the 1920s when Southern Railway workers purchased old rolling stock which were dragged off the end of the line to be used as holiday shacks.

Hoffman (July 23, 1903 in New York City - December 6, 1967 in Los Angeles) was a notable thereminist. At age 14, began playing the violin professionally in New York City. Under the stage name Hal Hope, he led nightclub and society bands. By 1936, he had taken up the theremin and begun featuring it in publicity for his engagements. In 1941, Hoffman moved to Los Angeles, where he established a medical practice and had little time for musical activity. But as the only theremin player in Local 47 of the Musicians Union, he got the call in 1945 when composer Miklos Rozsa decided he wanted to use a theremin in the score to Spellbound. Hoffman began performing under his real name; he was customarily referred to as \\"Doctor\\" because he was also a podiatrist.[ All Music bio] In the wake of the film's success, he was asked to play on many more soundtracks; for instance, The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). He was in demand for horror movie and sci fi soundtracks through the end of the 1950s. In the late 1940s, he recorded three studio albums with bandleader Les Baxter. These were forerunners to exotica; they also influenced Sun Ra, who recorded a composition from Perfume Set to Music on his first LP, Jazz by Sun Ra. One of Hoffman's last recordings, made in 1967, was Safe as Milk by Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band, where he appeared on two tracks. Death Hoffman died of a heart attack on December 6, 1967.

Description Male has the uppersides of wings dark brown. Forewings and hindwings are overlaid from base outwards for some distance with purplish blue, clear dark blue or shining metallic green. The extent of this colour very variable; in some specimens, on the forewing it spreads irregularly outwards mainly along the costa and on the hindwing in the middle to the disc; in others, it covers the basal three-fourths of the wings, leaving a well-defined broad terminal margin of the ground colour on the forewing, and on the hindwing, broad costal, terminal and dorsal margins; cilia conspicuously white. Underside of forewing is a clear, slightly brownish grey, paler along the costal and terminal margins; a transverse, slightly lunular discocellular spot and a transverse series of six small discal spots black, all with slender white edgings, the discal series placed in a slight curve, the posterior three spots en echelon; no terminal markings except an anteciliary dark line. Hindwing metallic green; in many specimens faint traces of one or two subbasal spots, entirely absent in others; a discocellular spot and a curved, transverse, discal series of from three to five spots, white; terminal markings, with the exception of a slender anteciliary dark line, absent, as on the forewing. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen brownish black, the shafts of the antennae ringed with white, the head, thorax and abdomen with some bluish pubescence; beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen white, the palpi fringed anteriorly with stiff black hairs. Female has the upperside uniform brown. Forewings and hindwings with slender, black, anteciliary lines and conspicuous snow-white cilia. Many specimens have some slight irroration (sprinkling) of blue scales at the bases of the wings. Underside similar to that of the male, the black spots on the forewing and the white spots on the hindwing generally larger, and on the latter wing more clearly defined. Wingspan of 26‚Äì33 mm.

It forms the westernmost lake of one of the branches of the Tyres√•n lake system and is located within the Lida-Riksten Open-air Area. With its isolated location surrounded by moorlands and forests, the lake remains relatively unaffected by human activities, which is mostly limited to precipitation and incoming nutrients from local soil. The lake is used for wireless radio-controlled boats in summers and for ice racing in winters, which have reduced the previously prominent bird life by the lake. Notwithstanding, it is classified as of considerable importance for nature conservation.Hacksj√∂n  Catchment area  The lake is located in a marshy moorland surrounded by forests. West of it is a former military airport today used for motocross and a shooting range. Sj√∂ar i Botkyrka In a 2002 key plan, the land surrounding the lake, owned by the city of Stockholm, is intended to be transformed into one of three nature reserve within the Lida-Riksten Open-air Area forming one of the important green wedges of Stockholm. Encompassing 240 hectares, it is marked as \\"conservation of rural area\\" and \\"larger area valuable for open-air life\\". Additionally, the area is considered as of significant archaeological interest since it 8.000 years ago, during the Stone Age, was an archipelago composed of sparsely scattered islands and thus contains many traces of the earliest settlements in Stockholm. The area between the lake and the golf course south of it is considered as of great importance for social history since the homestead there is believed to be about 1.500 years old.Inriktningsprogram Lida-Riksten = Environmental influence = The shallow lake is moderately rich in nutrients and virtually unaffected by pollution. Additionally, it is rich in humus which gives the water its dark brown colour. With a pH of 7,3, the lake is unlikely to acidified.  Flora and fauna  Aquatic plants thriving in the shallow lake include bladderwort, common club-rush, and water lilies. The quagmire bordering the lake, dominated by peat moss and reed, also include sedges, marsh willowherb, common marsh bedstraw, mare's tail, gypsywort, bog-myrtle, white water-lily, milk parsley, broad-leaved pondweed, marsh cinquefoil, grey sallow, common club-rush, bur-reed, narrow leaf cattail, and broadleaf cattail. Open-air and motor sport activities have driven away a range of birds species once abundant by the lake, including the colony of black-headed gulls which once dominated it, other common species such as pochard, common teal, mute swan, Eurasian coot, and more rare visitors such as osprey and black-throated diver. Fry of smooth newt was reported in 2000, the only amphibian reported by the lake. An inventory of damselflies in 1997 resulted in a list of emerald damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, variable damselfly, southern hawker, brilliant emerald, four-spotted chaser, eastern white-faced darter, and black darter. A second inventory in 2000 produced the following list interpreted as a normal amount of species: common hawker, brown hawker, Irish damselfly, variable damselfly, downy emerald, red-eyed damselfly, northern white-faced darter, brilliant emerald, and black darter.

He is best remembered for his restoration and production of The Beggar's Opera by John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch, and its sequel, Polly, in 1920‚Äì23. Austin was the older brother of the composer Ernest Austin (1874‚Äì1947). The standard melody for the carol \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\\" was published by Austin in 1909. He arranged a traditional folk melody, adding a two-bar motif for \\"Five gold rings\\". He also altered the lyric, adding \\"on\\" at the beginning of each verse.The New Oxford Book of Carols Training and early career Born Frederick William Austin in Poplar, Middlesex on 30 March 1872 the son of William and Elizabeth Austin, his father was a shirt tailor.1881 Census of Fulham, RG11/55, Folio 85, Page 48, Frederick William Austin, aged 9, a Scholar, born Poplar, living at 15, Elm Grove, Hammersmith, London with parents William and Elizabeth Emily Austin, also listed five sibilings including Ernest John Austin aged 7. Austin was sent at the age of about 12 to live at Birkenhead, where he received organ and music lessons from his Uncle, Dr. W. H. HuntA Dictionary of Modern Musicians, Dent 1924, and had singing training from Charles Lunn. By 1896 he had obtained a B.Mus. from Durham University and was organist in several Birkenhead churches. He became a teacher of harmony, and later of composition, at Liverpool College of Music. At Liverpool he became close friends with the composer Cyril Scott, and through him was introduced to H. Balfour Gardiner, who became a lifelong friend. Through them he was received into the circle of young English composers known as the Frankfurt Group, and their friends. These included Scott, Gardiner, Norman O'Neill, Roger Quilter, Percy Grainger (owing to their training at the Hoch Conservatory) in Frankfurt and such friends as Ernest Bryson, Benjamin Dale, Gervase Elwes, Eug√®ne Goossens, fils and Arnold Bax. This group, in which Frederick Delius sometimes appeared, often performed each other's music in informal surroundings, and Austin in particular used to improvise at the piano with Arnold Bax. In August 1900 he completed his first orchestral work, the concert Overture Richard II, which received its first performance on 12 December 1901 by the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra under Dan Godfrey.Source: original Concert Programme In 1902, the year of his marriage to Amy Oliver, Austin gave lessons in composition to Thomas Beecham, sang Tchaikovsky's \\"Pilgrim's Song\\" for a Henry Wood promenade concert, and was introduced to Hans Richter, for whom he later sang in Beethoven's Choral Symphony and Missa solemnis, and Bach's St Matthew Passion. In 1904 he moved to Pinner, sang under Felix Weingartner and at Wagner nights at the Prom Concerts, and took the name role in Mendelssohn's Elijah at Gloucester in the Three Choirs Festival. In June 1905 he took part in Beecham's London debut at the Bechstein Hall, in the first London performance of Scott's Ballad of Fair Helen of Kilconnell (dedicated to him).  Recitals in London and the provinces  At the 1905 Sheffield Festival Frederic Austin gave the final scena from Eugene Onegin, with Olga Wood (repeated 1911). At Hereford he appeared in Franck's Les Beatitudes, and introduced songs by Thomas Dunhill. His Queen's Hall performances included the Four Serious Songs of Brahms. His first major London recital (Aeolian Hall) with Hamilton Harty (piano) was on 3 April 1906, and he sang for the Philharmonic Society. For Weingartner he gave the Die Walk√ºre finale with Agnes Nicholls, and at Queen's Hall the premiere of Balfour Gardiner's When the lad for longing sighs. In 1906 at Southport he took baritone roles in The Dream of Gerontius (beside John Coates) under the baton of the composer, Sir Edward Elgar. In April 1907 he was at Reading, Berkshire, in Parry's De Profundis and Stanford's Elegiac Ode: at Hanley he gave the premiere of Havergal Brian's By the Waters of Babylon. In October, after Gerontius at Preston, he sang for Elgar in The Apostles at Birmingham. Henry Wood introduced Austin's symphonic composition Rhapsody: Spring, and engaged him to sing in two concerts, including that in which Delius's Piano Concerto in C minor was first given. Austin met Delius that year, and also made a Covent Garden debut, a small role in Tannh√§user, for Richter.  New work in opera and oratorio  1908 saw much oratorio, with Handel's Messiah (Wood, Queen's Hall), Gerontius (with Coates, Manchester, under Richter), Elgar's King Olaf (Norwich Festival), Judas in The Apostles (Liverpool), Bach's Phoebus and Pan (Queen's Hall), and Coleridge-Taylor's Hiawatha's Wedding Feast. His first Covent Garden lead appearance was Gunther (G√∂tterd√§mmerung) in Richter's English Ring cycle, repeated three times in February 1909. Late in 1908 he and Cyril Scott gave a recital of Scott's songs at the Bechstein Hall. At the Sheffield Festival of 1908 he was exceptionally busy, with performances of Samson and Delilah, Schumann's Paradise and the Peri, Sir Walford Davies' Everyman, Beethoven's Choral Symphony, and Debussy's L'Enfant Prodigue, specially re-scored by the composer, and delivered under Henry Wood with Austin, Agnes Nicholls, and the tenor Felix Senius. At this Festival also on 6 October he gave the English premiere (following the Essen, 1906, first) of Delius's Sea Drift. Wood chose Austin as the only man \\"who could be trusted to sing it con amore\\". He sang it again in December, and in February 1909, for Beecham: Birmingham first heard it in 1912. Austin premiered Granville Bantock's Omar Khayyam Part III (Birmingham 1909), and in that year sang The Apostles (Judas) and Parry's Job at Hereford. At Liverpool in September 1909 was the first Festival of The Musical League, created by English composers for performance of their music; Austin's symphonic poem Isabella appeared, and he sang in Ethel Smyth's The Dance and Anacreontic Ode, Havergal Brian's By the Waters of Babylon, and Vaughan Williams‚Äô cantata Willow-wood.  Operatic work and expanding repertoire  In 1910 Austin commenced his regular operatic career, appearing as Wotan and Wanderer, and doubling as Gunther, in the Edinburgh Denhof Opera Company Ring cycle under Michael Balling. He also appeared in two Ring cyles at Covent Garden. At Hereford he performed the traditional Festival-opening Elijah (and again in 1911), and gave the premiere of Bantock's Gethsemene, and in London repeated the Omar Khayyam. For the Philharmonic Society he gave songs by Ethel Smyth under her direction. In 1911 he was also singing concert performances of The Damnation of Faust (Berlioz) and Faust (Gounod), Dvo≈ô√°k choral works, Handel oratorios, Beethoven Missa solemnis, the Mozart Requiem, Brahms A German Requiem, Max Bruch's Frithjof and Lay of the Bell, Mendelssohn's St Paul and Die erste Walpurgisnacht, and many other works. In 1912 Beecham took the Denhof Ring cycle to Glasgow, Hull, Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester, and in these years Austin also appeared with them in the first English Elektra (Richard Strauss), as Kunrad in Feuersnot, Dr Coppelius in The Tales of Hoffmann, Gratiano in Cos√¨ fan tutte, Tomasso in Tiefland (Eugen d'Albert), Escamillo in Carmen and as Vanderdecken in The Flying Dutchman. In 1913 the Denhof Company was wound up and reformed as the Beecham Company, and until around 1920 Austin appeared for Beecham also as Wolfram (Tannh√§user), Iago (Otello), Ford (Falstaff), Hans Sachs (Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg), and in Madama Butterfly, La boh√®me, Pagliacci, Joseph Holbrooke's Dylan, and other works.  English recital and drama  In the spring of 1912 was the first series of the Balfour Gardiner Queen's Hall Concerts, devoted to contemporary English music, which effectually transformed the acceptance and establishment of the English composers. In the fourth concert Austin sang Scott's Helen of Kirconnell again, and gave the premiere of Norman O'Neill's La belle dame sans merci. Austin's own symphonic Rhapsody: Spring was also repeated, and in March 1913 his Symphony in E was first performed. In 1912 Austin delivered his own Three Songs of Unrest, and gave a serious lecture on the songs of Hugo Wolf. Before the War he was also singing in Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. In 1914 at The Music Club in London he performed several songs of Arnold Schoenberg in the composer's presence. Roger Quilter dedicated his song The Jocund Dance (Op. 18, No. 3) to him, written 1913‚Äì14. From 1913 Austin developed close connections with Rutland Boughton, and assisted in the development of the English music drama at Glastonbury. In the Summer Festivals of August 1914 and 1915 he sang the role of Eochaidh the King in The Immortal Hour there, and again at Bournemouth in 1915, with Frank Mullings and Percy Heming, and in 1916 was King Arthur in The Round Table. 1916 also saw the first performance of his most lasting orchestral composition, Danish Sketches, Palsgaard, conducted by Thomas Beecham on 11 December for the Royal Philharmonic Society.  Operatic farewell  Austin's last formal operatic performance was as Count Almaviva in The Marriage of Figaro for Beecham, at Covent Garden in 1920. Neville Cardus, who saw him in the role beside Agnes Nicholls and Frederick Ranalow, wrote: \\"Nobody else has passed across the closing scene of the opera with half of Austin's grace of bearing and suggestion of courtly cynicism\\".  The Beggar's Opera  The restoration of the musical score for The Beggar's Opera by John Gay and Dr Pepusch (originally produced in 1728) was undertaken by Frederic Austin and completed in 1920 in time for the production by Nigel Playfair, with artistic designs by Claud Lovat Fraser, which opened at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith on 6 June 1920 and ran for a record number of 1,463 performances until 23 December 1923. Austin preferred the simpler versions made by Pepusch to the edition prepared by Thomas Arne. He appeared as Peachum, with Elsie French, Frederick Ranalow (Macheath), Sylvia Nelis (Polly) and others, conducted by Eug√®ne Goossens. The entire venture received universal acclaim, and was performed in Paris, Canada, America and Australia. In 1922 Austin revived the sequel, Polly. Recordings were made of the original cast production.  Radio and recordings  Austin composed music for a made-for-radio short drama, The Blacksmith's Serenade (based on a poem by Vachel Lindsay), which was aired by the British Broadcasting Company on 15 January 1924. He made recordings for both the Gramophone Company and Columbia Records.  Directing and composition  In 1922 he became Artistic Director of the British National Opera Company, reformed out of Beecham's company, and in 1923 was elected a member of the Royal Philharmonic Society. In this way, and through his teaching, he continued to train and encourage English singers for many years more. He continued to compose theatre incidental music, notably for The Knight of the Burning Pestle (1923), The Insect Play (1923), Congreve's The Way of the World (1924), John Drinkwater's Robert Burns (1925), Vallombrossa (1926), and Prudence (1931). He wrote a cello sonata in 1927. In 1932 he made a last singing appearance in Alfred Reynolds‚Äô Derby Day. He composed the music for the Ealing Studios film Undercover (1943), aka Underground Guerrillas (USA), The Insect Play (1939) (TV), The Knight of the Burning Pestle (1938) (TV), and for the movie Midshipman Easy (1935), aka Men of the Sea (USA: reissue title). Family life He was married to Amy and they had a son and a daughter. Frederic Austin's son Richard (1903‚Äì89) was the chief conductor of the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra (now the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra) from 1934 until 1939, and became Head of the Opera Department of the Royal College of Music in 1953. Austin died in a hospital in the Kensington area of London on 10 April 1952 aged 80.\\"Mr. Frederic Austin.\\" Times [London, England] 12 April 1952: 8. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 2 August 2015.

Host and symptoms  left Soybean (Glycine max) is the most economically important host of soybean stem canker caused by Diaporthe phaseolorum var. caulivora. Since the early 1940s, Stem Canker was a prevalent disease in the upper Midwest. Soybean host plant susceptibility has been researched since the early 1950s, bringing light to the need for developing resistant varieties. Botanist AA Hildebrand ran a varietal selection experiment to determine susceptible varieties in northern climates. Successful removal of susceptible cultivars ‚ÄúHawkeye‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlackhawk‚Äù greatly reduced the impact of this disease. In the past 30 years, successful breeding for resistant varieties has greatly reduced the significance of this disease in certain parts of the country, however sporadic incidences of the disease still occur. In soybean, the main factor affecting disease susceptibility is the presence or absence of resistance genes in specific cultivars. Along with soybean, many common weed species have been studied as potential hosts. Investigations have identified 13 weed species for soybean stem canker when inoculated directly with ascospores. Inoculation success to these weeds species was found in greenhouse experiments though outdoor trials were not as successful. More recently, many weed species, such as black nightshade, curly dock, and morning glory, have been confirmed as susceptible hosts, yet few show symptomology of the disease until plant death. Weed species as host for this disease are of particular interest because of their potential to act as an inoculum for the disease on soybean. 290x290px Disease symptoms occur primarily on the stems, leaves and can lead to whole plant symptoms. Reddish brown lesions on the lower stem of soybean plants progress into brown cankers. In some cases, the disease can spread to all parts of the stem. Stem girdling can result in premature plant death. Grey streaking along the lower stem and taproot has also been observed. Studies suggest a toxin may influence the development and symptomology of stem canker. Leaf symptoms include interveinal chlorosis and necrosis during early reproductive stages. Leaves eventually dry and fall off the plant as the disease worsens. Stem canker has similar symptomology as brown stem rot, fusarium wilt, phytopthora stem rot, sudden death syndrome, tobacco streak virus, and sclerotinia stem rot, which can make distinguishing this disease particularly difficult. Stem canker can be differentiated primarily by its long dark red or brown canker that can extend over multiple nodes. Inside the stem, discoloration is localized to areas near the canker or lesion.  Environment  Environmental conditions during the vegetative growth stage are most important for stem canker development. When plants are infected at V3 growth stage they are subject to the highest severity of disease of any growth stage. The combination of early growth stage susceptibility to disease and optimal environmental conditions can cause a stem canker epidemic if not treated properly. Fields subjected to hail damage have been shown to have increased stem canker severity. The optimal air temperature for infection occurs at 83.5 ¬∞F, while infection readily occurs when temperatures are between 82 ¬∞F and 93 ¬∞F. Along with optimal temperature, moisture is needed for infection. During vegetative growth stages, rainfall is crucial to the development of stem canker infections. Cumulative rainfall is positively related to higher disease severity. Further, if dry conditions follow wet conditions during vegetative growth stages, plant mortality increases. This is because the disease inhibits the flow of water through the stem to plant extremities, therefore dry periods after infection stress plants more than wet periods after infection.red/brown symptomology of soybean infected with stem canker  Management  Management of soybean stem canker is greatly influenced by proper cultivar selection. Selecting resistant soybean varieties is currently the best management practice for this disease, followed by crop rotation to a non-host crop. Furthermore, soybean grown for seed should not be planted if harvested from a field with a history of stem canker. In-furrow fungicides applied at planting can reduce infestation to seed during germination, but will not control the disease completely. Rotations in to corn, wheat or sorghum for at least 2 years is recommend after a severe infestation. Fungicide sprays for this disease may not be effective on susceptible cultivars, however will manage an outbreak in moderately susceptible cultivars. Fungicides, such as benzimidazoles, should be sprayed during the early vegetative growth stages to avoid an outbreak. Minimum or no till fields have a higher susceptibility to stem canker because of the increased amount of crop residue that increases the survival rate of the disease. Incorporation of residue or tillage will reduce disease development in the field. Lastly, high organic matter and/or high fertility levels can positively influence stem canker infestation. To manage this, use best management practices to maintain sufficient soil fertility levels.291x291px  See also  *292x292pxList of soybean diseases  References   External links * Index Fungorum * USDA ARS Fungal Database Category:Fungal plant pathogens and diseases Category:Soybean diseases phaseolorum var. caulivora ","title":"Diaporthe phaseolorum var. caulivora"},{"id":"11798013","text":"Presteg√•rdskogen () is a village area located in the municipality of Grimstad in Aust-Agder county, Norway.

M. diffusa infections on soybeans are referred to as powdery mildew. Importance: Powdery mildew of soybeans is an important pathogen and tends to cause epidemics about every 10‚Äì15 years in Wisconsin. In 1975 the first epidemic there was observed and several have occurred since. Powdery mildew affects the soybean plants. When 82% of the soybean leaf area is covered by M. diffusa, photosynthetic and transpiration rates are less than half of normal soybeans, thus affecting soybean yield. Different studies have found different amounts of yield reduction due to the powdery mildew. In Illinois, measured yield losses ranged up to 14 percent. From Iowa studies, measured yield losses were estimated up to 10 bushels per acre. In Wisconsin, the yield loss was up to 5 bushels per acre. And it's important to note that yield loss due to powdery mildew will be greater for soybeans planted late for a region compared to early-planted soybeans. Environment: The temperature plays an important role in powdery mildew development. Powdery mildew favors cooler temperatures (65-77 degrees F). Temperatures above 30 degrees C appears to constrain disease development. Rainfall does not appear to affect the disease. But, it has been found that a shorter leaf wetness duration appears to be a driver of the disease. Additionally, low relative humidity is required for disease development. Management: Variety selection is a tool that can be used to help combat powdery mildew. It's not entirely effective because no variety of soybean has complete resistance to powdery mildew, but there are definitely some varieties more susceptible than others. Resistance affects initial inoculation of the plant. The currently effective management tools are fungicides. They can be sprayed once powdery mildew is detected and they kill the spores. This affects the dispersal and secondary inoculation of the plant. Some examples of fungicides include Topsin M, Quadris, and Headline, with the last two being less effective. Another management practice is planting date. Early-planted soybeans tend to show less severity of powdery mildew than late-planted soybeans.

Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae is the perfect form of the causal pathogen of pod and stem blight of soybean.Mueller, Daren and Alison Robertson. \\"Soybean Diseases.\\" Iowa State University of Science and Technology. (2010): 28. It is a fungal ascomycete that commonly infects seeds, pods, stems, and petioles. This pathogen is also found in its imperfect state, Phomopsis sojae. This is a common disease of most soybean growing regions in the United States. Losses result from losses in field stands, reductions in yield, and poor seed quality.Malvick, Dean K. Pod and Stem Blight, Stem Canker, and Phomopsis Seed Decay of Soybeans. Urbana-Champaign: Department of Crop Sciences University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1997. Symptoms Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae can infect any above ground parts of the plant; the disease may be present without showing any symptoms. Early-season infection typically takes place without showing any symptoms. Mid-season symptoms appear as tiny black dots (pycnidia) on fallen leaves or abscised petioles. Late-season symptoms (pycnidia) appear on dead stems, branches and seed pods. Heavily infected seeds will often fail to germinate. Visual symptoms include: ‚Ä¢ Light brown spots on cotyledons or lower stems, ‚Ä¢ Small black dots (pycnidia) appear in rows along necrotic stem, branch, and petiole tissue (mature leaf tissue is not commonly infected),Copping, L.G., M.B. Green and R.T. Rees. Pest Management in Soybean.

Hosts Alternate hosts include: Lima bean, cowpea, snap beans, peanuts, lespedeza, lupine, pepper, tomato, okra, onion, and garlic.Kucharek, Tom. Some Common Soybean Leaf and Stem. Gainesville: University of Florida, 2001.  Environmental factors  Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae is present throughout the world wherever soybeans are in production. Conditions that favor this fungal infection include: ‚Ä¢ A warm, wet, and humid growing season, particularly during pod development and maturation, ‚Ä¢ Continuous soybean planting and infected seed, ‚Ä¢ Delayed harvest, insect damage, and hail damage lead to seed infection. Disease cycle Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae (sexual) and Phomopsis sojae (asexual) overwinter as mycelia in infected seeds and plant debris. This serves as the primary inoculum. In the spring, pycnidium are produced on plant debris and the petioles of abscise leaves. In the early summer, perithecia develop on decaying stem tissue. The perithecium contain asci while the pycnidium releases conidia. Spores will germinate and penetrate through primarily immature or wounded tissue. Spores need at least 24 hours of free moisture to cause infection. The spores can then spread into mycelium and form perithecia and pycnidia. More progressive spread of disease can occur through secondary infection. Secondary infections will occur when conidia are dispersed onto different parts of the by the splashing of water. Management High quality thoroughly cleaned seed and crop rotation are the primary controls of Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae.Pederson, Palle and Craig R Grau. \\"Effect of Agronomic Practices and Soybean Growth Stage on the Colonization of Basal Stems and Taproots by Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae.\\" 2010. Resistant varieties are available but not commonly used. Proper seed treatments will protect seeds and increase stand count. A higher stand count will lead to less branching and breaking of branches.

Early life Alma Routsong was born Elma Louise Routsong in Traverse City, Michigan on November 26, 1924.‚ÄúElma Louise Routsong‚Äù in the U.S., Social Security Applications and Claims Index, 1936-2007. Her father, Carl Routsong, was a police sergeant, and her mother, Esther Miller Routsong, was a nurse.‚ÄúElma L Routsong‚Äù in the 1930 United States Federal Census (Census Place: Traverse City, Grand Traverse County, Michigan; Page: 4B; Enumeration District: 0019; FHL microfilm; 2340723). She had an older brother Richard and a younger brother Gary. Routsong attended Traverse City Senior High School, where she was on a college preparatory track. She was the senior class president and participated in several other organizations including the National Honor Society.‚ÄúElma L Routsong\\" in the U.S., School Yearbooks, 1900-1999 (School Name: Traverse City Senior High School; Year: 1942). As an adolescent, Routsong read lesbian fiction including Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness, and Djuna Barnes' Nightwood. During World War II, Routsong served in the WAVES. She trained at the Farragut, Idaho Naval Training Center before working as a hospital apprentice.Traverse City Record-Eagle, August 17, 1945. After leaving the WAVES, she graduated from Michigan State University in 1949 with a degree in art.  Literary career  Routsong began her literary career in 1953 with the publication of her first novel, A Gradual Joy. She followed the success of this book with Round Shape in 1959. Both books were mainstream and lacked lesbian content; however, they were autobiographical and captured \\"her seemingly happy heterosexual married life.\\" In 1969, Routsong self-published A Place for Us under the pseudonym Isabel Miller. She used her own Bleecker Street Press imprint - named after her shared apartment with Elizabeth Deran on Bleecker Street - after numerous rejections from mainstream publishers. Routsong based this novel on the 1820s relationship between folk painter Mary Ann Willson and Florence Brundage, and as a result, it was her first explicitly lesbian work. Routsong and Deran sold copies of the book outside Daughters of Bilitis meetings. As the book increased in popularity, McGraw-Hill took notice and republished it as Patience and Sarah in 1972. For each of her subsequent works, Routsong continued to use the name Isabel Miller, a combination of an anagram of \\"Lesbia\\" and her mother's maiden name. Between 1968 and 1971 Routsong worked as an editor at Columbia University. In 1971, the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table of the American Library Association created the first award for LGBTQ+ books, the Stonewall Book Award, which celebrates books of exceptional merit that relate to LGBTQ+ issues. Patience and Sarah was the first winner. From the mid-1970s until 1986 Routsong was a proofreader for Time Magazine.

Personal life  Alma married Bruce Brodie in 1947 and they had four daughters; Natalie (1949), Joyce (1952), Charlotte (1954), and Louise (1958). In 1962, Routsong met Elizabeth Deran at a church event and entered into a romantic relationship with her. Brodie and Routsong divorced in 1962. When the pair's relationship became known, Deran was forced to leave her job with the United States Treasury Department. Routsong and Deran then moved to Greenwich Village in New York City. Routsong struggled with alcoholism in the 1970s as her relationship with Deran came to an end. The pair rekindled their friendship in the early 1980s, and Deran motivated Routsong to write more books. Routsong developed an interest in spiritualism and enjoyed making astrological charts of the women in her life. She also spent time at Kate Millett's Women's Art Colony Farm. Later in life, Routsong shared a relationship with artist Julie Weber.  Death  Routsong died of ovarian cancer at age 71 in Poughkeepsie, New York on October 4, 1996.‚ÄúAlma L.

Ferrari was a well- regarded pastor and theologian who led two dioceses before being appointed to the prestigious Milanese archdiocese which he led until his death. But he was later accused of Modernism which led to a strained relationship with Pope Pius X who finally reconciled with Ferrari in 1912. The cause for his canonization opened after his death in 1963 and he became titled as a Servant of God. He was named Venerable in 1975, and Pope John Paul II beatified him in 1987. Life =Education and priesthood= Cardinal Ferrari's remains housed in the Cathedral of Milan. Andrea Ferrari was born on 13 August 1850 in Lalatta (now Palanzano) in the Parma province as the eldest of four children to the shoemaker Giuseppe Ferrari and Maddalena Longarini; his baptism was celebrated on 14 August. His two paternal uncles Abbondio and Pietro were priests serving in Parma. He received his First Communion in 1860 from Father Giovanni Agostini and received his Confirmation in 1866. He felt called to serve as a priest and was educated in Parma where he was to obtain a doctorate in theological studies in 1883. Ferrari received the first two minor orders on 18 September 1869 and the other two on 23 September 1871. He received the subdiaconate on 21 September 1872 and the diaconate on 15 December 1872. He was ordained to the priesthood on 20 December 1873 for the Diocese of Parma where he served from 1874 until 1890. He also served as the archpriest of Fornovo di Taro from 1874 until 1875 when he was made the vicar curate for the San Leonardo church. Ferrari served as the Vice-Rector for seminarians in Parma and served also as a professor of mathematics and natural sciences in 1875 and later became its rector in 1877. He served also as a professor of theological fundamentals and ecclesial historical sciences as well as educating them in moral theological subjects in 1878. It was later that he published the \\"Summula theologiae dogmaticae generalis\\" in 1885 which proved to be a respected work in the field at that time and it was reprinted several times. =Episcopate= In mid-1890 he was appointed as the Bishop of Guastalla and he received his episcopal consecration as a bishop on 29 June 1890 from Cardinal Lucido Parocchi in the church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Villa Lante. The co-consecrators were Vincenzo Leone Sallua and Giovanni Maria Majoli. He took possession of his new diocese on 3 October 1890 and was later transferred to the Diocese of Como in mid-1891 after a brief tenure in Guastalla. In Como he was noted for his dedication to the people and made several pastoral visits to see all his parishes. In 1894 the newspaper Corriere della Sera noted his \\"meticulous visits\\" as proper diocesan management and attentiveness while noting that \\"he talks well with a good voice\\". In 1893 he supported the appointment of Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto ‚Äì future Pope Pius X ‚Äì as Patriarch of Venice and was successful in securing the appointment. =Cardinalate= Ferrari was elevated to the cardinalate in 1894 and Pope Leo XIII named him as the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Anastasia (the title and red hat were conferred a week after the elevation). It was just a week after his elevation that he was transferred to the Archdiocese of Milan and was granted the pallium prior to his departure; he also took Carlo as a middle name in honour of Charles Borromeo who was a predecessor during the Counter-Reformation period. His private assistant while in Milan was Father Giovanni Rossi. Ferrari was a strong supporter and promoter of Rerum Novarum and espoused the core themes of social justice that the pope highlighted in that document. He also enlisted the aid of Giuseppe Toniolo to promote it and make it a theme of his professorship. His main mission in Milan was to preserve the faith of the people through catechesis and he made four pastoral visits as archbishop. He pushed for the publication of the Catechism of Pius X in Milan as a step towards this aim. He also visited all parishes in his archdiocese and was attentive to the social circumstances of each parish. In addition Ferrari held several episcopal conferences to discuss matters of ecclesial life. In 1895 he held the Archdiocesan Eucharistic Congress from 1-5 September 1895. Ferrari participated in the papal conclave in 1903 that elected Pope Pius X, and had been considered to be \\"papabile\\" for his pastoral qualities. Ferrari petitioned the cardinals to support a pastoral candidate to become pope and began casting his votes for his old colleague Sarto. He tried to persuade Sarto to accept the election if chosen though the latter insisted that he should not be voted for and that he would not accept. But Ferrari insisted that the refusal could become harmful for the Church and painful for Sarto for the remainder of his life. But Francesco Satolli convinced Sarto of the ramifications of his refusal which prompted Sarto's acceptance of the pontificate. Ferrari returned to Milan on 10 August and that month travelled to Cologne to meet with its archbishop Cardinal Anton Hubert Fischer. In 1908 he was in London at Westminster for the nineteenth Eucharistic Congress held from 9-13 September. In 1910 he organized festivities for the third centennial of the canonization of Charles Borromeo. In 1918 he founded the Women's Youth for Azione Cattolica and entrusted its direction to Armida Barelli. During World War I he formed a group that was dedicated to caring for soldiers and prisoners and was awarded in 1919 with the Grand Cross of the Order of Saints Maurizio and Lazzaro for his efforts. Ferrari was accused of \\"Modernism\\" in 1907 which was an accusation that Pope Pius X had accepted. He was no Modernist and denounced them in a pastoral letter he issued in 1908. Despite this the accusations put him in a negative position with Rome and he decided to keep quiet so as not to attract the ire of Pius X. He had been accused of excessive liberalism and defended his archdiocese against misunderstandings that Rome held though this prompted a 1911 canonical investigation. In 1912 the pope realized the mistake he had made and received the cardinal after this matter was resolved for a reconciliation. In 1912 he promoted the establishment of the newspaper L'Italia which replaced L'Unione. He also partook in the conclave in 1914 that elected Pope Benedict XV. Ferrari was on good terms with Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli ‚Äì the future Pope John XXIII. The two knew the other well and Roncalli was the one who celebrated his funeral. He was also close with Achille Ratti who was his successor in Milan and the future Pope Pius XI. Ferrari ordained as priests the future cardinals Camillo Caccia Dominioni (1899) and Carlo Confalonieri (1916) in addition to Bishop Giorgio Giovanni Elli (1903) and Archbishop Mario Giardini (1904). =Death= Ferrari died in 1921 at 5:55pm after he finished the recitation of one of the rosaries he himself started due to throat cancer, and was buried in the archdiocesan cathedral under the Sacred Heart altar. The first sign of his ailment around 1918 was simple hoarseness, later diagnosed as throat cancer. His old friend Roncalli would refer to him later as an \\"authentic saint\\". In Legnano a church was constructed from 1987 to 1989 and dedicated to him. Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini consecrated the church in 1991. Beatification The Milanese came to revere Ferrari for his strong holiness and his old friend Pope John XXIII opened his cause for canonization on 10 February 1963. This came after his Milanese successor Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster opened the informative phase of investigation for his beatification in 1951. Pope Paul VI (another Milanese successor) proclaimed him to be Venerable on 1 February 1975 in recognition of his life of heroic virtue. Pope John Paul II beatified Ferrari on 10 May 1987 in Saint Peter's Square. The current postulator for this cause is the Franciscan priest Giovangiuseppe Califano.

The recording features a sparse musical arrangement and recalls Harrison's work with the Beatles during 1966‚Äì68, through its Indian-inspired mood and use of sitar drone. Part of Harrison's inspiration for the song was the popular 1971 book Be Here Now by spiritual teacher Ram Dass ‚Äì specifically, a story discussing the author's change in identity from a Western academic to a guru in the Hindu faith. Some Harrison biographers interpret \\"Be Here Now\\" as a comment from him on the public's nostalgia for the past following the Beatles' break-up. Harrison wrote the song in Los Angeles in 1971, while working on the soundtrack to the Ravi Shankar documentary Raga, and shortly before organising the Concert for Bangladesh. The recording took place in late 1972 at his Friar Park home, with musical contributions from Klaus Voormann, Nicky Hopkins, Gary Wright and Jim Keltner. Contrary to the song's message, its release coincided with heightened speculation regarding a possible Beatles reunion, following Harrison, Ringo Starr and John Lennon recording together in Los Angeles in March 1973. \\"Be Here Now\\" has received critical attention for its dreamlike sound and the quality of Harrison's acoustic guitar playing. Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone described the track as a \\"meltingly lovely meditation-prayer\\", while author Ian Inglis views it as a moving musical expression of \\"the spiritual, scientific, and metaphysical implications of time\\".Inglis, p. 42. Singers Robyn Hitchcock and Ian Astbury have each covered the song. Background and composition In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison recalls coming up with the tune for \\"Be Here Now\\" while staying in Nichols Canyon, Los Angeles, in the spring of 1971. At the time, Harrison was in Los Angeles producing the soundtrack to Raga,Badman, p. 36. an Apple Films documentary about Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar.Lavezzoli, p. 187.Clayson, p. 308. The same visit led to Harrison staging the Concert for Bangladesh in New York that summer,Lavezzoli, pp. 187‚Äì88. following a plea from Shankar, a Bengali Hindu, that something be done to raise international awareness for refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War.Greene, pp. 185‚Äì86.Shankar, pp. 217, 219‚Äì20. In his autobiography, Harrison says of writing the song: \\"I was almost falling asleep. I had the guitar in bed and the melody came fast.\\"Harrison, p. 252. In keeping with this description, the mood and melody of \\"Be Here Now\\" have a meditativeJohn Metzger, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", The Music Box, vol. 13 (11), November 2006 (retrieved 11 January 2015). and dreamlike quality.Spizer, p. 255.Tom Doyle, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", Q, November 2006, p. 156. The song is in the musical key of A, with a time signature of 4/4 throughout.\\"Be Here Now\\", in George Harrison Living in the Material World: Sheet Music for Piano, Vocal & Guitar, Charles Hansen (New York, NY, 1973), pp. 78‚Äì79. According to his handwritten note on the lyrics reproduced in I, Me, Mine, Harrison played the guitar part in open G tuningHarrison, p. 253. ‚Äì which would typically require the placing of a capo on the guitar's second fret, to attain an open chord of A major.Keith Wyatt, \\"G Whiz: How to Play Like Keith Richards, Master of Open G Tuning\\", Guitar Legends, March 2007, pp. 60, 61. Author and music journalist Paul Trynka writes of \\"Be Here Now\\" containing \\"modal folk riffs\\". The composition includes a recurring guitar motif, played over the chords of A major and A major 7, and is structured into two sections of verse separated by a middle eight. Lyrical inspiration and interpretation Ram Dass (right, pictured with Zalman Schachter-Shalomi), whose autobiographical story \\"The Transformation\\" inspired Harrison's song Harrison drew inspiration for the song's lyrics from \\"The Transformation: Dr. Richard Alpert, PhD. into Baba Ram Dass\\". A humorous story,Clayson, p. 322. \\"The Transformation\\" was the first of four sections in Ram Dass's book Be Here Now, a popular introductory text to Hindu spirituality.Allison, p. 85. As Richard Alpert, Dass had been a Harvard academic and an associate of Timothy Leary during the early 1960s,Tillery, p. 43. before embracing Hinduism ‚Äì like Harrison in 1966, via experimentation with hallucinogenic drugsGeorge Harrison, in The Beatles, pp. 179‚Äì80.The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 34, 36. ‚Äì and changing his name.MacDonald, pp. 164, 167fn. Before the book's publication in 1971, according to musicologist Ian MacDonald, the phrase \\"Be here now\\" had become a \\"hippie maxim\\",MacDonald, p. 167. reflecting a fundamental contention of Hindu philosophy regarding the all-importance of the present moment. For Harrison, the present meant his identity outside the public's perception of him as a Beatle,Allison, p. 137. a role he had already tired of in 1965‚Äì66,The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 144‚Äì45. during the height of the band's fame.Doggett, pp. 21‚Äì22.Lavezzoli, p. 176. Author Ian Inglis writes of the parallels between \\"Be Here Now\\" and one of Harrison's 1968 compositions for the Beatles, \\"Long, Long, Long\\", due to the two songs' \\"common subject matter: time\\". In \\"Be Here Now\\", Harrison delivers his message in simple terms, stating that \\"The past was\\", whereas \\"Now is\\".Josh Hathaway, \\"VCV: George Harrison ‚Äì 'Be Here Now'\\", Blogcritics, 25 February 2010 (retrieved 11 January 2015). According to theologian Dale Allison, the song also addresses the Hindu concept of maya,Allison, pp. 83, 115. whereby the physical world is an illusion and the only truth is to realise the divine nature of one's soul.Tillery, pp. 106‚Äì07.Schaffner, pp. 142, 159. Harrison warns against what Allison terms \\"mistak[ing] the material world, which is only a grand illusion, for the real world\\", particularly in the lyrics to the middle eight:Allison, pp. 114‚Äì15. Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, views \\"Be Here Now\\" as the singer questioning the validity of his role as a world-famous musician.Leng, p. 137. Leng writes of Harrison yearning to escape \\"a Fab Four prehistory that so obsessed the media and his fans\\", and draws parallels between the former Beatle's predicament and a comedy sketch by Monty Python, featuring the character Arthur \\"Two Sheds\\" Jackson.Leng, p. 133. In the sketch, Jackson is a composer of modern symphonies, yet the interviewer fixates on the trivial detail of how he acquired his unusual nickname.\\"Time Machine: October 6 1969 ‚Äì Something completely different\\", Mojo, October 1999, p. 35. In his book discussing the religious themes in Harrison's songwriting,Inglis, p. 171. Allison qualifies the literal message of \\"Be Here Now\\" by stating, \\"this song must be understood as an endorsement [of Dass's book]\\", yet it is \\"hardly the typical George\\".Allison, pp. 84‚Äì85. Allison cites many compositions from throughout Harrison's career, all covering issues of karma and reincarnation, as evidence that Harrison \\"encourages all of us to ponder our inescapable end and so imagine the future\\", rather than focusing only on the here and now.Allison, pp. 79‚Äì80, 85. Harrison returned to the specific theme of \\"Be Here Now\\" in later songs such as \\"Flying Hour\\"Inglis, p. 102. and \\"Just for Today\\",Huntley, p. 208. the last of which adopts the here-and-now message as an inspirational statement for members of Alcoholics Anonymous.Allison, pp. 137, 142, 148.

In the search for a good sound, Voormann recorded his part, on standup bass, in one of the bathrooms at Friar Park; he remembers being interrupted during a take by longtime Beatles aide Mal Evans flushing the toilet.

Writing for The Huffington Post in 2011, Steve Rabey cited Harrison's drawing of inspiration from Dass's book, as from the Tao Te Ching and Autobiography of a Yogi in other songs, as an example of his standing as both a \\"cafeteria Hindu\\" and \\"perhaps the most explicitly and consistently theological rock star of the last half-century\\". Rabey concludes: \\"While he failed to convert everyone to his beliefs, he nudged his [former] bandmates ‚Äì and his listener fans ‚Äì a bit further to the East, encouraging audiences to open themselves to new (or very old) spiritual influences.\\"Steve Rabey, \\"George Harrison, 'Living In The Material World'\\", The Huffington Post, 9 October 2011 (retrieved 11 January 2015). =Biographers' assessment= Among Beatles and Harrison biographers, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter admire the \\"hypnotic, droning effect\\" on \\"Be Here Now\\", which they describe as \\"a lovely track\\";Madinger & Easter, p. 441.

Ian Inglis admires the song as \\"one of Harrison's most haunting and mysterious compositions\\", and writes of the recording: \\"The gentle, largely acoustic backing, and Harrison's achingly beautiful vocal give the song a nebulous, yearning quality, almost as if something barely understood is slipping out of sight.\\"Inglis, p. 41. Inglis likens \\"Be Here Now\\" to the performance monologue \\"Time\\" by English actress and author Joyce Grenfell, whose conclusion that \\"there is no such thing as time ‚Äì only this very minute, and I am in it\\" he finds echoed in Harrison's \\"sense of wonder and helplessness in the face of the spiritual, scientific, and metaphysical implications of time\\".Inglis, pp. 41‚Äì42. =2014 appraisal= The song continues to receive attention following the 2014 Apple Years Harrison reissues. In Mojo, Tom Doyle writes of Living in the Material World \\"spot[lighting] the spirituality and the dreaminess\\" in Harrison's songwriting, through \\"the gentle, non-preachy 'The Light That Has Lighted the World' and 'Be Here Now', both great works of look-around-you wonder\\".Tom Doyle, \\"Hari Styles: George Harrison The Apple Years 1968‚Äì1975\\", Mojo, November 2014, p. 109.

One generation per year. Flight time in June - early August. Female are much less common than males and practically do not leave their habitats. After mating, the female lays one egg each on the stems and leaves of the forage plants of caterpillars - Astragalus spp. Egg discoid, with pronounced cells on the surface. Its color is white with a greenish tinge, the micropyle is green. Eggs hibernate with the already formed caterpillar inside. Caterpillars of the first age are yellowish-green with dark dots and a brownish-black head. They eat up the parenchyma of the leaves, scrape off the juicy inner parts of the stipules, but especially prefer to penetrate into the young buds and eat in them. Caterpillars of the senior, the fifth, age are bright green with a black head. They feed on buds and flowers. By the end of their development, they sometimes acquire a reddish hue. Puppies in shelters - under the bushes of a forage plant or in cracks in the soil, attaching to the substrate a spider's loop. The length of the pupa is 11-12 mm.

This square holds the historical building of Universitat de Barcelona, celebrated for its neo-gothic style. The station is accessible for disabled persons since 1995, when Barcelona Metro line 2 opened its platforms. It is served by TMB-operated Barcelona Metro lines L1 and L2. Line 1 Barcelona Metro line 1 station was opened on 10 June 1926 as part of the original section of Ferrocarril Metropolit√† Transversal between the former station of Bordeta and Pla√ßa de Catalunya station. The former metro station was very different from this one and was similar to Urgell and Rocafort metro stations. The metro station was closed between 1971 and 1972 when the new rail link between Sants railway station and Pla√ßa de Catalunya was built, which passes very close to the metro station. This forced to change the original composition of the platforms to two platforms situated one above the other. The current station was opened on 23 December 1972, is located under Pla√ßa de la Universitat and has two levels. The upper level has a large hall that is used by line 2 too and has some commercial areas and a customer office. On the same level there is one of the platforms while the other one is situated on the lower level. Line 2 Barcelona Metro line 2 station was opened on 25 September 1995 with the opening of the line between Sant Antoni and Sagrada Fam√≠lia metro stations. The station is located under Ronda de Sant Antoni, between Sep√∫lveda and Aribau streets. On the upper level there is a large hall which is the same for line 1 and it is connected directly with line 1 platform toward Hospital de Bellvitge.

Common leaf symptoms are browning, chlorosis, and necrosis Foliar symptoms which are often seen with genotype A are chlorosis, defoliation, and wilting. Brown Stem Rot of soybeans is a common fungal disease in soybeans grown in the upper Midwest and Canada. Brown Stem Rot (BSR) may commonly reduce yield of soybeans by 10-30% on susceptible varieties, up to 10 bu./acre in severe cases. BSR decreases both the number of beans per pod as well as bean size as a result of wilting, premature defoliation and lodging. In addition to decreasing yield, plants infected by BSR can be difficult to harvest due to lodging of soybean plants. University of Wisconsin Extension Field Crop Pathologist, Damon Smith ranks Brown Stem Rot as the third most important soybean disease in Wisconsin. Brown Stem Rot can impact most susceptible soybean beans in the north central states, especially during cooler late summer months. There are many ways to manage Phialophora gregata. The most effective form of management is disease resistance, but crop rotation, tillage, SCN management, and changing the pH of the soil can also be effective Robertson, A.E. and Nutter, F.W. Iowa Soybean Disease Survey. www.soybeandiseasesurvey.info Symptoms and Signs Phialophora gregata‚Äôs infection of a soybean plant is accompanied by browning of the plant‚Äôs vascular and pith tissues. The plant often exhibits chlorosis and necrosis, as well as leaf browning. Wilting and defoliation are also known to occur. Signs of infection often go unnoticed until reproductive stages of a plant‚Äôs life cycle. They can be diagnosed earlier on by opening the stem and visualizing the pathogen. One can visualize signs by cutting open the stem in early stages of infection, but symptoms do not become apparent until after the soybean pod formation.Monsanto. \\"Brown Stem Rot and Sudden Death Syndrome in Soybean.\\" Lewis Hybrids.

Genotype A causes browning of stems as well as foliar symptoms such as interveinal chlorosis, defoliation and wilting.Robertson, A. & Tabor, G. ‚ÄúSoybean Brown Stem Rot.‚Äù Iowa State University. 2012. Symptomatic leaves have a shriveled appearance, but remain attached to the stem. Genotype B causes only browning of stems. Secondary symptoms of brown stem rot are stunting, premature death, decrease in seed number, reduced pod set, and decrease in seed size. Disease from P. gregata is easily confused with Fusarium wilt, due to the similar vascular symptoms observed in both.Smith, S. N. \\"Association of Phialophora Gregata with Fusarium Solani F. Sp. Pisi in Garbanzo Beans in California.\\" APS Net 83.9 (1999): 876.1. Web. The diseases could be differentiated through growth on isolation media. The two diseases can be further distinguished by splitting the stems. A split stem with Fusarium infection would have tan or light brown discoloration in the cortex and a normal white pith, while a split stem with P. gregata would have a discolored, reddish brown pith. Root rot and blue masses of spores are symptoms only caused by Fusarium. Environment The fungal pathogen, Phialophora gregata, that causes Brown Stem Rot (BSR) of soybeans prefers conditions that are also optimal to soybean plant growth. Later planted soybeans are more susceptible to BSR as cooler temperatures during early pod forming stages make the plant most vulnerable. Early season wet conditions can also favor early season pathogen growth, often causing more dramatic affects later in season. Foliar symptoms of BSR are favored when conditions are cool during flowering and pod formation. The Phialophora gregata pathogen proliferates in stem tissues when soil has high moisture content and air temperatures remain near 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. Fungal growth of Phialophora gregata shuts down above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Low water available to the plant, late in season can also dramatically increase disease severity. As the disease is soilborne, it is not uncommon to find clusters of diseased plants together. Additionally, the prevalence of Soybean Cyst Nematodes (SCN) can affect the growth of Phialophora gregata, the BSR pathogen. Greater populations of SCN, can greatly increase the likelihood and impact of Brown Stem Rot. Disease Cycle The Phialophora gregata fungus is a deuteromycete with a monocyclic life cycle. There are two strains of Phialophora gregata, referred to as genotype A and genotype B. Genotype A causes both foliar and stem symptoms, while genotype B causes only stem symptoms. The Phialophora gregata fungus produces no survival structures, but can overwinter as mycelium Pedersen, Palle. ‚ÄúBrown Stem Rot.‚Äù 2006. in decaying soybean residue. During overwintering, conidia are produced; these conidia are the inoculum for new plants in the spring. The amount of asexual reproduction that occurs during the winter affects the spring inoculum levels. Infection initially occurs in the roots of young soybean plants, and then spreads to the stem (and foliage, depending on the strain). Generally, early and severe foliar symptoms indicate that the yield losses will be heavier. Economic Significance Brown Stem Rot of soybeans is a source of major crop loss. It is not uncommon for soybeans grown in management systems prone for brown stem rot to have yield losses between 10%, with a maximum potential loss of 30%.Grau, Craig, and Nancy C. Kurtzweil. \\"Brown Stem Rot: Management and Variety Options.\\" The Yields II Project: Research-Based Management Information. Soybean Research and Development Council, Oct. 2003. Web. It has been listed as the 3rd most important disease to soybeans in Wisconsin. A recent study showed that nearly half the counties in Iowa, from 2006 and 2007, had brown stem rot of soybean. Management Brown Stem Rot can be easily managed using several techniques employed by the grower. Common techniques include crop rotation, tillage, selection and Soybean Cyst Nematode management. There are currently no available seed treatments or fungicides to prevent or protect against BSR. Crop rotation The easiest and most effective way to protect against Brown Stem Rot in soybeans is crop rotation. Phialophora gregata has no overwintering structures but instead lives in plant debris. Due to this, waiting until plant debris has decomposed (at least one full growing season) is the most effective way to control this disease. In cases of severe infection 2‚Äì3 years without planting soybeans in infected fields may be necessary. =Disease resistance= Given the presence of Phialophora gregata on much of the nation‚Äôs soybean acres, research and development have gone into selecting soybean varieties that have greater resistance to BSR, although not immunity. Brown stem rot has the uncanny ability to produce yield loss even without obvious symptoms. Higher rated BSR tolerance in beans can be selected for when choosing a variety to be grown. Genetic Resistance should not be relied upon when expected BSR pressure is high. Additionally, choosing varieties higher rated for tolerance against soybean Cyst nematode can be effective. =Tillage= More decomposition of soybean residue results in less pathogen, as the fungus can only survive on soybean residue. Therefore, tillage can be effective. Once the soybean residue has decomposed, the survival of P. gregata is drastically decreased. It is common for farmers to practice both crop rotations and tillage in a cyclic fashion.Dorrance, Anne E., and Dennis R. Mills. \\"Brown Stem Rot of Soybean.\\" Ohio State University, 2008. Web. <>. This is done by conducting little to no tillage when a soybean crop is planted after corn, followed by intensive tillage when a corn crop is planted after soybean. =Management of Soybean Cyst Nematode (Heterodera glycines) = P. gregata is often found to be more severe in the presence of SCN; soybean plants showing resistance to SCN have been found to produce greater yields. Soybean plants with resistance to both SCN and genotype A of P. gregata can grow normally, even when both pathogens are present. Given the correlation between SCN populations and disease impact of BSR it is important to control SCN. SCN can be controlled using rotation to non-susceptible crops, seed treatments, variety selection and nematicides. = Monitoring soil pH = Maintaining a soil pH near 6.5-7.5 can also help protect against BSR. There is evidence of significantly lower disease severity with a near neutral soil pH, although there is no evidence to suggest a neutral pH prevents BSR.

It has also been known as Warren Halt and Warren Bridge Halt. History =1920s= Opened on 16 July 1927, this was one of three stations deliberately included in the timetable despite being sited far from a population centre, in the hope that their location near a bridge (Prince of Wales and Warren) or level crossing (Botolphs Bridge Road) would encourage traffic connecting from buses or other road transport. The experiment failed, in all three cases. Warren Halt closed later in the same year that it had opened (1927) and no longer appeared on timetables. =1940s= In the immediately post-war timetable of 1946, the halt was briefly re-opened.Butt, R.V.J. (1995). The Directory of Railway Stations, Patrick Stephens Ltd, Sparkford, , p. 241. The railway company had regained control from the War Office (the line had been a military railway from 1939 to 1945) and concentrated efforts on recovering custom on the main Hythe to New Romney section, of which Warren Halt was a part. However, the experiment with this little station was again deemed a failure, and it closed again at the end of 1946. Current use The site at Romney Warren is now home to the Romney Marsh Visitor Centre. During 2008, in connection with the provision of transport links to the Centre, it was announced that Warren Halt was due to re-open in February 2009.Announced by railway management in 'The Marshlander' railway magazine, issue 164 (Autumn 2008), page 9 (illustrated on page 23). In the Autumn of 2008 the railway's General Manager confirmed in newspaper reports that construction work had begun on the installation of platform facilities.Example from Kentish Express newspaper. The Romney Marsh Visitor Centre and Country Park authorities also publicised the re-opening as part of the transport solution to providing 'green tourism' (tourism that is environmentally friendly).Bullet-point citation in green tourism summary. The actual re-opening ceremony took place on Monday 16 February; a special train (hauled by locomotive No 4) carried approximately 60 specially invited guests including local mayors, councillors, and Michael Howard (member of parliament for Shepway).See BBC news report for details. Passenger services to the station began later the same week, on Thursday 19 February 2009, and have continued on selected days annually since that time, and also for pre-booked private parties. Facilities The original station never had any buildings or surfaced platforms, and for many years there was nothing to mark the site as trains passed by at speed. During late 2008 a single surfaced and fenced platform was laid on the up line, this being the line on which the Romney Marsh Visitor Centre shuttle trains began operating between New Romney and Warren Halt in February 2009. The surfacing and fencing was completed in December 2008, with partial funding by the local County Council and District Council, and with signage added in January 2009. The extensive rabbit warren from which both the station and this local area of New Romney take their name, is still very much evident, and large numbers of rabbits may be viewed from the train when passing the location.

Hosts and symptoms  While P. longisetula is best known for infecting strawberry crops, it can also infect other plants, including apricots, peaches, guava, and tomato fruits. Some plants such as beans are immune to the disease. It takes on average about two weeks for mature plants to be fully infected, while plants at an earlier stage of growth spread infection more slowly. Infected areas become covered with white mycelia growth and the host plant starts to rot from the skin to the core of the plant. The plant as a whole suffers as the leaves develop lesions with spores to spread the disease.  Infection  P. longisetula infects other plants through the leaves. Spores grow on the leaves and spread through the wind. The disease thrives in areas with high humidity and high wind. Once the plant has been infected, the disease spreads throughout the leaves and then attacks the fruit, causing it to rot on the skin and then the core. After eight days, most mature plants will be completely infected and a new phase of the infection begins, which spreads to the next plant. The host plant dies in most circumstances. Using pesticides and growing strawberries in areas with low wind power and low humidity can slow the progression of the infection.  Importance  Countries depend on growing strawberries as profits. If the disease manifests in the area then by the time farmers locate it, a percentage of the plants are wiped out and profits are lost. Countries most affected are those that do not have access to pesticides or greenhouses to protect the plants.

Habitat  The habitat of L. kluyveri is not well known because only about 30 isolates have been recorded. It is, however, thought to be environmentally widespread. First described as Saccharomyces kluyveri in 1956 from fruit flies in California, this species has been isolated from slime fluxes on tree, soils in North America and Europe, and cheeses. It has also been reported as an agent of disseminated mycosis in a patient with HIV/AIDS.  Biology  Lachancea kluyveri is a budding yeast related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or baker's yeast, the model organism intensively used in biochemistry, genetics and cell biology. In 2003 it was transferred from the genus Saccharomyces to the genus Lachancea named for Canadian mycologist and yeast biologist Marc-Andr√© Lachance. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and L. kluyveri have several fundamental differences that warrant genomic comparisons. First, like most cell types, L. kluyveri resorts to fermentation (degrading sugars in the absence of oxygen) only when oxygen is limiting. S. cerevisiae, on the other hand, prefers to carry out fermentation even in the presence of oxygen. This means that L. kluyveri makes a more efficient use of glucose for energy production. Therefore, L. kluyveri provides a contrasting model to one of the most unusual features of S. cerevisiae. Second, L. kluyveri has a simpler genome organization than S. cerevisiae: it appears to have become a species before the whole genome duplication that occurred in the Saccharomyces lineage. As a result, its genome is smaller (about 9.5 million base pairs) than that of S. cerevisiae with fewer duplicated genes. Additionally, L. kluyveri is becoming more widely used as a model organism and for industrial applications, such as the production of proteins, since its biomass yield is greater than that of S. cerevisiae due to more efficient use of glucose.  Sequencing information  The L. kluyveri genome was originally sequenced in 2002 to approximately 3.5√ó whole genome shotgun (WGS) coverage.

The witty scientist loves his job and enjoys life to the fullest, often without considering the feelings of others. Karl-Friedrich Boerne loves the good things in life, plays golf, fences and is fond of classical music, especially if it's loud. But what he loves most are his luxury cars (Jaguar, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, etc.), which he drives without worrying too much about wrecking them, and the sound of his own voice. Boerne's irony and intellect make him seem cynical and arrogant at times, but still it's evident that there's a good heart beating inside him. His wife left him and ever since Boerne lives alone in his big city apartment. The much smaller neighbouring apartment he let to inspector Frank Thiel. But not only at home the idiosyncratic, quirky forensic physician and the quiet, down-to-earth police officer share a close partnership.

It is a minor component of traditional blends such as Chianti, but interest has revived in recent years. In Umbria it is made into a light quaffing wine, while in Tuscany it is made into a bigger, more structured style. Pedigree and relationship to Sangiovese A study published in 2007 using DNA typing tentatively identified the Ciliegiolo and Calabrese di Montenuovo as the parents of Sangiovese, but this was immediately disputed by another study published the same year which claimed Ciliegiolo was the offspring of Sangiovese rather than the other way around.‚ÄòSangiovese‚Äô and ‚ÄòGarganega‚Äô are two key varieties of the Italian grapevine assortment evolution , M.

Some legend claims that Ciliegiolo came to Italy from Spain, but the genetic link between Ciliegiolo and Sangiovese is practically impossible to reconcile with a Spanish origin. Distribution and wines Ciliegiolo vines. =Italy= There are around 5000 hectares of Ciliegiolo in Italy, a figure that has been in steady decline. It is used in the wines from Torgiano Rosso Riserva, Parrina, Colli Lucchesi, Chianti, Val di Cornia, Golfo del Tigullio and Colli di Luni. It's possible to find ciliegiolo grapes as well in Sicily. The label is \\"Dedalo\\". It is a product from Fiore winery in Butera area. Vine and viticulture Ciliegiolo is not an easy grape to grow, suffering at times from shatter.

Young was a mentor and teacher to Ethan Allen. Early life and activities Thomas Young was born February 19, 1731 in Little Britain, New Windsor, New York. He was the son of first cousins John and Mary Crawford Young. John Young emigrated from Ireland to America in 1729 with a group led by Charles Clinton of County Longford. Charles Clinton, John Young, and Mary Crawford Young were all second cousins through their grandparents, siblings James Clinton 1667-1718 and Margaret Clinton Parks 1650-1710. The Clintons, Youngs, and Crawfords shared a distant grandmother, Elizabeth Blount mistress of King Henry the VIII and mother of the king's son Henry FitzRoy. As Covenanters, the Clinton family had escaped from Scotland to Ireland in the seventeenth century (New York Genealogical and Biographical Record 1882, Vol. 12: p. 193). Although Charles Clinton and John Young had emigrated from Ireland with the intention of settling in Pennsylvania, near a group of fellow-Covenanters, their chartered ship, the George and Anne, was taken off- course by an unscrupulous captain who held Clinton and Young captive until they paid a ransom. During their captivity, most of their fellow passengers perished of small-pox, starvation, or ship fever. Finding themselves in Boston after this ordeal, within a year Young and Clinton made their way to Little Britain. It is unclear when Mary Crawford joined them in Little Britain or whether she was among the passengers of the George and Anne, although it seems likely that she emigrated with her cousins (New York Genealogical and Biographical Record 1882, Vol. 13, p. 882). A biographical sketch of Charles Clinton describes Little Britain thus: \\"after investigation, [Charles Clinton] settled at a place designated (for town purposes until 1763) as 'the precinct of the highlands.' It is embraced in modern Orange County, but until after the Revolutionary War it was in Ulster County. His neighborhood was called Little Britain. James Kennedy, a New York merchant . . . James Alexander, a New York lawyer and member of the Governor's council, and his co-partner, William Smith, had before secured grants of land in the precinct of the highlands. It was border-land toward the Indians, west of the Hudson, not yet settled by white men. It was without habitations, except Indian huts, and without roads, except Indian trails. So late as about 1845, more than one hundred years after this settlement, a living occupant could describe the appearance of one hundred wigwams on the side hills within sight of her father's house (Eager, p. 619)\\" (ibid.). Thomas Young's parents settled in farmland adjoining the Clintons, and here Thomas Young was born soon after the group's arrival in Little Britain. After demonstrating much intellectual brilliance as a child, Thomas Young was apprenticed to a local physician and then began his own medical practice in Amenia, Dutchess County in 1753. In 1755 he married Mary Winegar of Litchfield, Connecticut. They had two sons and four daughters.Bielinski, Stefan. \\"Thomas Young\\", New York State Museum, nysm.nysed.gov; accessed January 10, 2016. In August 1758 Young was indicted in the Crum Elbow Precinct of Dutchess County, New York for speaking and publishing \\"blasphemous words\\" concerning the Christian religion.Raphael, Ray. Founders, The New Press, 2013 Young met the young Ethan Allen while Allen was living in Salisbury, Connecticut and Young was practicing medicine just across the provincial boundary in Amenia, New York. Only five years older than Allen, Young taught the younger Allen a great deal about philosophy and political theory. Young and Allen eventually decided to collaborate on a book intended to be an attack on organized religion, as Young had convinced Allen to become a Deist. They worked on the manuscript until 1764, when Young moved away from the area, taking the manuscript with him.Jellison, Charles Albert. Ethan Allen: Frontier Rebel. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press (1969); They also shared an interest in ingrafting, an early form of inoculation, particularly in relation to smallpox. Ingrafting was considered a heresy by New England clergy and punishable by law, if not conducted with the consent of the town selectman. In 1764 Allen insisted that Young inject him with the virus on the Salisbury meeting house steps to prove whether or not ingrafting worked. They did this on a Sunday. Allen did not suffer from the virus, but when news of what they had done spread Allen was hauled into court for a blasphemous response to the investigating official.\\"Story of Ethan Allen\\", let.rug.nl; accessed January 10, 2016. In October 1764, Young moved to Albany to establish a medical practice. While there his son Rasman was baptized at the Lutheran Church. Young invested in a real estate venture with John Henry Lydius which subsequently failed. Young became involved in the resistance movement in Albany in the 1760s and helped found the Sons of Liberty there.\\"Thomas Young\\" profile, gilderlehrman.org; accessed January 10, 2016. Boston Young arrived in Boston in 1765 and became a family physician to John Adams.\\"Thomas Young\\", Boston Tea Party Museum He was active in the city‚Äôs Committee of Correspondence and became a committeeman for the Sons of Liberty. In 1773 Philadelphia physician Benjamin Rush and member of the Sons of Liberty authored a diatribe inveighing against British Tea and its harmful properties, both physical and political. It was quickly reprinted in Boston, where Young had already spoke out in a similar vein in a letter to the Boston Evening Post of October 25.Knott, Sarah. Sensibility and the American Revolution, UNC Press Books, 2009 Young is considered to be one of the active organizers of the Boston Tea Party although he himself did not actually participate in the destruction of the tea chests. At the time he was addressing a crowd at the Old South Meeting House on the negative health effects of tea drinking. According to the Boston Tea Party Museum, this was probably a diversion intended to help the Tea Party organizers by keeping the crowd in the Meeting House while the tea was being destroyed. Philadelphia In 1774 Young, having received death threats (although for his political or religious views is unclear) left Boston for Newport. In 1775, he moved to Philadelphia and helped frame the state constitution, the most democratic constitution among the original states. Young also suggested the name of Vermont for the new state north of Massachusetts, which was originally called New Connecticut. The reasoning in his letter to the Vermont Constitutional Convention in 1777 was that most of Vermont was in the Green Mountains, said to have been named by Samuel de Champlain. Young chose to combine \\"vert\\" (green) with \\"mont\\" (mountain)\\"Origins of the Names of U.S. States\\", World Almanac, (Edward A. Thomas, ed.), 2005 to honor the Green Mountain Boys. Young named several communities in New York state, including Amenia. Young died in Philadelphia on June 24, 1777, aged 46.

Most of the songs concern rogues and drinking. \\"Weila Waile\\" is a tragic murder ballad, sung with a certain jollity. The album title is both an allusion to hard liquor, particularly Irish whiskey, and to the musical difficulty of the fourteen songs chosen for the album, which emphasize the considerable depths of talent of the group, from the intricate fiddle and banjo work on \\"The Galway Races\\" and the reels, to the impressive a cappella rendition of \\"Limerick Rake\\".

Prior to this conference, three other high-level meetings between the Netherlands and Indonesia took place; the Linggadjati Agreement of 1947, Renville Agreement of 1948, and the Roem‚ÄìVan Roijen Agreement of 1949. The conference ended with the cession of sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia.  Background  On 17 August 1945, Indonesian nationalist leader Sukarno declared Indonesian independence. The Dutch, who had been expelled in 1942 by the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, viewed the Indonesian leadership as Japanese collaborators, and wanted to regain control of their colony. The conflict between the Dutch and Indonesian nationalists developed into a full-scale war of independence. By mid-1946, both sides were under international pressure to negotiate. The Dutch favoured a federal Indonesian state, and organised the Malino Conference in July 1946, which led to the establishment of the State of East Indonesia. In November, the Dutch and Indonesian sides reached an agreement at Linggadjati, in which the Netherlands agreed to recognize republican rule over Java, Sumatra and Madura, and that republic would become a constituent state of a federal United States of Indonesia. On 28 January 1949, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 67, calling for an end to the recent Dutch military offensive against republican forces in Indonesia and demanding the restoration of the republican government. It also urged the resumption of negotiations to find a peaceful settlement between the two sides. Following the Roem‚ÄìVan Roijen Agreement of 6 July, which effectively endorsed the Security Council resolution, Mohammad Roem said that the Republic of Indonesia‚Äîwhose leaders were still in exile on Bangka Island‚Äîwould participate in the Round Table Conference to accelerate the transfer of sovereignty. The Indonesian government, in exile for over six months, returned to the temporary capital at Yogyakarta on 6 July 1949. To ensure commonality of negotiating position between the republic and the federal delegates, from 31 July until 2 August, Inter-Indonesian Conferences were in Yogyakarta between all component authorities of the future United States of Indonesia. The delegates agreed on the basic principles and outline for the Federal Constitution of 1949. Following preliminary discussions sponsored by the UN Commission for Indonesia in Jakarta, it was decided the Round Table Conference would be held in The Hague.  Negotiations  The conference in session Negotiations, which took place from 23 August to 2 November 1949, were assisted by the United Nations Commission for Indonesia. The Dutch, Republic of Indonesia and Federal Consultative Assembly delegations reached agreement resulting in a number of documents, namely a Charter of Transfer of Sovereignty‚Äîto come into immediate effect‚Äîa statute of union, a draft constitution, an economic agreement and agreements on social and military affairs. The Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian Union would not have any powers: it would be a consultative body with a permanent secretariat, a court of arbitration to settle any legal disputes, and a minimum of two ministerial conferences every year. It would be headed by the Dutch Queen in an entirely symbolic role. The delegations also reached agreement on the withdrawal of Dutch troops \\"within the shortest possible time,\\" and for the United States of Indonesia to grant most favoured nation status to the Netherlands. In addition, there would be no discrimination against Dutch nationals or companies and the republic agreed to take over trade agreements negotiated by the Dutch East Indies. However the two major areas of disagreement were over the debts of the Dutch colonial administration and the status of Western New Guinea. Negotiations over the internal and external debts of the Dutch East Indies colonial administration were protracted, with each side presenting their own calculations and arguing over whether the United States of Indonesia should be responsible for debts incurred by the Dutch after the Japanese occupation of Indonesia in 1942. In particular the Indonesian delegations were indignant at having to cover what it saw as the costs of Dutch military action against it. Finally, thanks to the intervention of the United States member of the UN Commission on Indonesia, the Indonesian side came to realise that agreeing to pay part of the Dutch debt would be the price they would have to pay for the transfer of sovereignty. On 24 October, the Indonesian delegations agreed that Indonesia would take over approximately ∆í4.3 billion of Dutch East Indies government debt. The issue of the inclusion or not of Western New Guinea almost resulted in the talks becoming deadlocked. The Indonesian delegations took the view that Indonesia should comprise the entire territory of Dutch East Indies. The Dutch refused to compromise, claiming Western New Guinea had no ethnic ties with the rest of the archipelago. Despite Dutch public opinion supporting transfer of Western New Guinea to Indonesia, the Dutch cabinet was worried it would not be able to ratify the Round Table Agreement in parliament if it conceded this point. Finally, in the early hours of 1 November 1949, a compromise was reached: the status of Western New Guinea would be determined through negotiations between the United States of Indonesia and the Netherlands within a year of the transfer of sovereignty. The conference was officially closed in the Dutch parliament building on 2 November. Aftermath The Dutch parliament debated the agreement, and the upper and lower houses ratified it on 21 December 1949 by the two-thirds majority needed. Despite criticism in particular of the Indonesian assumption of Dutch government debt and the unresolved status of Western New Guinea, the Indonesian legislature, the Central Indonesian National Committee, ratified the agreement on 14 December. Sovereignty was transferred to the United States of Indonesia on 27 December. # The Kingdom of the Netherlands unconditionally and irrevocably transfers complete sovereignty over Indonesia to the Republic of the United States of Indonesia, and thus recognises the Republic of the United States of Indonesia as an independent and sovereign Nation. # The Republic of the United States of Indonesia accepts this sovereignty based on the provisions of its Constitution; the Kingdom of the Netherlands has been notified of this proposed constitution. The unresolved status of Western New Guinea would lead to the dispute, which was only ended in 1962.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide. This eclipse is a hybrid event, a narrow total eclipse, and beginning and ending as an annular eclipse. It was visible within a narrow corridor in the Pacific Ocean. The path of the eclipse started south of New Zealand and crossed the Pacific Ocean in a diagonal path and ended in the extreme northwestern part of South America. The total solar eclipse was not visible on any land, while the annular solar eclipse was visible in the southern tip of Puntarenas Province of Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela.

It stars Benedict Wong, John Henshaw, Eddie Marsan, Pierce Quigley, Omid Djalili, Alan Williams, Philip Jackson, and Olivia Colman. The film centres on a group of gardeners at a Merseyside allotment, who react angrily when a group of refugees are given plots at the site, but after they get to know them better, soon change their minds. The film was previously known under the title The Allotment. Production The original idea for the film came from Carl Hunter's involvement with the Merseyside community group \\"Art in Action\\". With the project he had worked with a number of refugees who had taken up residence in Liverpool. The refugees were each given an allotment as part of a Liverpool City Council initiative. This led Hunter to produce a series of documentaries about the lives of the refugees entitled Putting Down Roots, they were broadcast as part of the \\"3-minute wonder\\" slot on Channel 4. Frank Cottrell Boyce saw some potential in the concept and asked Hunter if he wished to work with him to turn the real-life story into a film. The film was supported by North West Vision, BBC Films and the UK Film Council. Shooting for the film began on 14 August 2006, taking place for six weeks. All filming took place in Merseyside, with the shoot providing numerous jobs for locals. Reception Leigh Singer gave the film four stars, calling it \\"a gentle, astute, life- affirming British comedy.\\" Tom Hawker gave it three stars, praising Eddie Marsan's performance and stating \\"Grow Your Own has about as much edge as a prize melon, but even if the land's been well filled, there's still plenty of fertile soil here. Occasionally melancholy, often funny, this is touching, lyrical home-grown fare.\\" Kevin Maher gave three stars, noting his favourite part of the film as being \\"a serious discussion between the gardeners about Bob the Builder.\\" Anthony Quinn of The Independent criticised the film citing \\"one could wish that this parable of difference and tolerance gladdened the heart, but its effortful comedy has quite the opposite effect\\", as well as expressing his distaste for the film's score. Catherine Chambers also disliked it, stating \\"Grow Your Own's twee optimism is sometimes a little too much to digest.\\" References External links Grow Your Own at the BBC Category:2007 films Category:2007 comedy-drama films Category:British comedy- drama films Category:British films Category:English-language films Category:Films about race and ethnicity Category:Films about immigration Category:Films directed by Richard Laxton Category:Films set in Liverpool Category:Films with screenplays by Frank Cottrell Boyce ","title":"Grow Your Own"},{"id":"11798745","title":"List of lakes named Diamond"},{"id":"11798749","text":"William Marsh Acker Jr. (October 25, 1927 ‚Äì June 21, 2018) was a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.

The idea gradually attracted the interest of some leaders of India's Congress Party (\\"Ahimsa Finds Teen Voice\\", The Telegraph, Calcutta) until a Satyagraha Conference resolution in New Delhi in January 2007, initiated by Indian National Congress President and Chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance Sonia Gandhi and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, called upon the United Nations to adopt the idea. On 15 June 2007 the United Nations General Assembly voted to establish 2 October as the International Day of Non-Violence. The resolution by the General Assembly asks all members of the UN system to commemorate 2 October in \\"an appropriate manner and disseminate the message of non-violence, including through education and public awareness\\". Also here The United Nations Postal Administration (UNPA) in New York City prepared a special cachet to commemorate this event, following a request from the Indian Ambassador at the Permanent Mission of India to the UN.

Cythna Letty is best remembered for her book \\"Wild Flowers of the Transvaal\\" which was published in 1962. When decimal currency was introduced in South Africa, she was asked to design the floral motifs for the 10, 20 and 50 cent coins. Besides painting she was an accomplished poet and published \\"Children of the Hours\\" when she was in her eighties. Cythna was the eldest child of her mother Josina Christina Lindenberg's second marriage and was named after the heroine in Percy Shelley's poem \\"The Revolt of Islam\\". The Lettys had five children and for many years the six children from Josina's first marriage were part of an extended, disciplined family. They were taught to play a number of musical instruments. Cythna's father, Walter Edward Letty, had many career changes and the family were often uprooted. As a result Cythna attended a total of 13 schools, ending at the Pretoria Girls' High School. With the outbreak of World War I, Walter enlisted and served in France, and remained there after peace was declared. Josina supported the family by illustrating genealogical charts. Her artistic skills were passed on to a number of her children, but only Cythna had a passion for botanical subjects. Cythna's main occupations until 1924 were teaching and nursing. For two years she worked as an artist, at the Veterinary Division at Onderstepoort near Pretoria, illustrating diseased and cancerous organs, after which she transferred to the Division of Plant Industry under Dr I.B. Pole-Evans. It was here that she started on 730 contributions to \\"Flowering Plants of Africa\\", an example of which is Anemone fanninii Harv. ex Mast. She resigned in 1938 to marry Oscar William Alric Forssman. After producing a son, she rejoined the Division of Botany in 1945 and stayed until 1966. She was awarded a silver medal by the Royal Horticultural Society for her exhibition of flower paintings in 1970. Her interest in Zantedeschia led her to a study of the genus and her revision appeared in Bothalia 11: 5-26 (1973). She illustrated numerous books on botany such as the Botanical Survey Memoir Trees and shrubs in the Kruger National Park (1951) by L. E. W. Codd, who was at that time director of the Botanical Research Institute. Others were The Stapelieae (1937) by White & Sloane, and Grasses and Pastures of South Africa (1955) by Lucy K.A. Chippindall. In 1973 she received an honorary LL.D. from the University of Witwatersrand. Kniphofia porphyrantha Bak. Calodendrum capense (L.f.) Thunb. Her ashes were scattered in the Cythna Letty Nature Reserve near the small town of Barberton in Mpumalanga. In 1989 the National Botanical Institute published a portfolio of seven prints of flower paintings selected from two journals kept by Cythna's mother, Josina Letty, and housed in the Institute's Mary Gunn Library in Pretoria. The Botanical Society of South Africa commemorated her by the awarding of the \\"Cythna Letty Medal\\" which is awarded for significant contributions to the promotion of South African flora through the medium of published botanical paintings or drawings. Plants named for her include Crassula lettyae Phillips and Aloe lettyae Reynolds. She is denoted by the author abbreviation Letty when citing a botanical name.

As a soldier, Ranjit Singh led the capture of the Haji Pir pass by the Indian army during the 1965 war with Pakistan. He also drew up the plans for Operation Blue Star, and served as the General-Officer-Commanding-in-Chief of the Southern Command. Later, he served as Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  Early life  Ranjit Singh Dyal was born in a Sikh family of the Teokar (also spelled Tuker) village in Punjab, British India (in the present-day Kurukshetra district of Haryana). His father was Sardar Bahadur Risaldar Ram Singh Dyal. His brother Rattan Singh Dyal was also in the army, and was awarded the Indian Distinguished Service Medal. He attended the Rashtriya Military School, Chail.  Military career  Dyal completed his schooling from Rashtriya Military School Chail and then graduation in 1942, and was admitted to the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun in 1946. He was later commissioned in the Punjab Regiment (Para) of the Indian Army, and was assigned to the 1st Battalion, which participated in the first Indo-Pak War during 1948 as a part of the 50 Independent Parachute Brigade. Between 1959 and 1962, he was deployed in the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) sector. After further education from the Defence Services Staff College, he was posted as a Brigade Major to the 50 Independent Para Brigade. Subsequently, he became second-in-command of the 1st Para (Special Forces) battalion in the Uri sector. He later commanded this battalion during 1965-1968 in Jammu & Kashmir, and also as part of the 50 Independent Para Brigade at Agra. =Indo-Pakistani War of 1965= During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Ranjit Singh (then a Major) led the 1st Para team to capture the strategic Haji Pir pass (which was later handed over to Pakistan after the Tashkent Agreement). According to the original plan prepared by Lieutenant General Harbaksh Singh, the then General- Officer-Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the Western Command, the Army was to capture Rustan and Badori (or Bedori) on the way to the Haji Pir pass. Ranjit Singh's unit was tasked with capturing Sank, Sar and Ledwali Gali to stop the enemy infiltration. However, the attack on Sank on the night of 25/26 August was unsuccessful, resulting in 18 casualties. Ranjit Singh's paratroopers captured Sank on the night of 26/27 August, and Point 1033 the next day. Meanwhile, four attacks on Rustan and Badori by other battalions had proved unsuccessful. Ranjit Singh then volunteered to capture the Haji Pir pass, and his battalion took over the operation on 27 August. The unit moved along the Hyderabad nullah with only damp shakarparas and biscuits as field ration. Ranjit Singh's paratroopers were fired upon by the Pakistani Army, but were saved by an unexpected shower. They subsequently captured some Pakistani soldiers from a house during the trek, took over their weapons and used them as load carriers for rest of the journey to the pass. The unit launched the final assault on the pass on 28 August, walking up 4,000 feet on foot. The attack was successful, as the Pakistan troops retreated from the pass. Ranjit Singh Dyal was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra for this operation. =Maha Vir Chakra Citation= The citation for the Maha Vir Chakra reads as follows In 1984, Ranjit Singh Dyal was appointed the security adviser to the Governor of Punjab for the Operation Blue Star, and effectively had the overall charge of leading the assault. At that time, he was chief of staff of the Western Army Command. Along with Kuldip Singh Brar and Krishnaswamy Sundarji, he drew up the plans to evict the Khalistani militants from the Golden Temple in Amritsar. In 2005, the Chandigarh police arrested two Babbar Khalsa militants recruited by Jagtar Singh Hawara to kill Ranjit Singh in retaliation for the Operation Blue Star. Ranjit Singh later became the General-Officer-Commanding- in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the Southern Command. He also served as the first head of the Chandigarh regional chapter of the Punjab Regiment Officers Association (PROA) in 2008.  Gubernatorial Career  Ranjit Singh Dyal served as the 10th Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry. He served from June 1988 to February 1990. After this stint, Dyal took over as the Lieutenant Governor of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  Last days  In his last years, General Singh was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He died on 29 January 2012 in the Command Hospital at Panchkula, where he had been admitted for terminal care.

(The white arrow is used to determine the position and orientation of the robot via a vision-based algorithm.) A Spherical Robot, also known as spherical mobile robot, or ball- shaped robot is a mobile robot with spherical external shape . A spherical robot is typically made of a spherical shell serving as the body of the robot and an internal driving unit (IDU) that enables the robot to move . Spherical mobile robots typically move by rolling over surfaces. The rolling motion is commonly performed by changing the robot's center of mass (i.e., pendulum- driven system), but there exist some other driving mechanisms . In a wider sense, however, the term \\"spherical robot\\" may also be referred to a stationary robot with two rotary joints and one prismatic joint which forms a spherical coordinate system (e.g., Stanford arm ). The spherical shell is usually made of solid transparent material but it can also be made of opaque or flexible material for special applications or because of special drive mechanisms . The spherical shell can fully seal the robot from the outside environment. There exist reconfigurable spherical robots that can transform the spherical shell into other structures and perform other tasks aside from rolling. Spherical robots can operate as autonomous robots, or as remotely controlled (teleoperated) robots . In almost all the spherical robots, communication between the internal driving unit and the external control unit (data logging or navigation system) is wireless because of the mobility and closed nature of the spherical shell. The power source of these robots is mostly a battery located inside the robot but there exist some spherical robots that utilize solar cells. Spherical mobile robots can be categorized either by their application or by their drive mechanism. Applications Spherical mobile robots have applications in surveillance, environmental monitoring, patrol, underwater and planetary exploration, rehabilitation, child-development, and entertainment. Spherical robots can be used as amphibious robots viable on land as well as on (or under) water. Locomotion The most common drive mechanisms of the spherical robots operate by changing the robot's center of mass. Other driving mechanisms make use of: (1) conservation of angular velocity by flywheels, (2) environment's wind, (3) distorting the spherical shell, and (4) gyroscopic effect. Current research The research on spherical robots involves studies on design and prototyping , dynamical modelling and simulation, control, motion planning, and navigation. From a theoretical point of view, the rolling motion of a spherical robot on a surface represents a nonholonomic system which has been particularly studied in the scope of control and motion planning. Commercial spherical robots Commercial spherical robots are available for sale to the public. Some current commercial products are GroundBot, Roball, and QueBall, as well as Sphero's BB-8, based on the droid character of the same name introduced in the 2015 film Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

He was the last consul of the Claudii Nerones until his descendant (the future emperor) Tiberius was elected in 13 BC. Biography His grandfather Tiberius Claudius Nero (a son of Appius Claudius Caecus) was the first person to have the cognomen Nero. =Career= In 204 BC, Claudius Nero was assigned as praetor to the provincia of Sardinia, where he gathered and shipped supplies of grain and clothing for soldiers under the command of Scipio in Africa.Livy 29.36.1‚Äì3. As consul, he was assigned to Africa with imperium equal to that of Scipio,Livy 30.27.1‚Äì5. but storms and delays in his preparations prevented him from ever arriving.Livy 30.38.6‚Äì7 and 30.39.1-3; Zonaras 9.14. His consular colleague was M. Servilius Pulex Geminus. =Later life= It is possible that this Nero was the one who in 172 BC participated in diplomatic missions. The historical sources for which pose difficulties. Livy says he was sent on an embassy with a Marcus Decimius to Asia and islands in the Aegean, including Rhodes and Crete, and travelled as far as Syria and Egypt. His task was to renew friendships and alliances, and to gather information on the influence of Perseus of Macedon.Livy 42.19.7‚Äì8 and 26.7‚Äì9. Polybius says he was accompanied by Postumius Albinus and a Marcus Junius Brutus, and describes their mission as urging the allies, particularly Rhodes, to join the Romans against Perseus.Polybius 27.3.1‚Äì5; Livy also has a similar account (42.45.1‚Äì7) that seems to repeat but confuse what he had reported earlier. It is also possible that this Claudius Nero was either the Tiberius Claudius Nero who was praetor in 178 BC, or the praetor of 181 BC who had the same name.See discussion by Broughton, MRR1 p. 415, notes 4 and 5. Friedrich M√ºnzer favors the praetor of 178 in this role. It is possible that the two later are also one and the same, possibly the consuls son.

It was first released on their second album Axis: Bold as Love (1967). Later, it appeared on the soundtrack for the 1969 film Easy Rider and the soundtrack for the 1991 film Point Break. Style and instrumentation The style of the song has been referred to as \\"acid-fueled blues\\". The guitar solo is noteworthy for making innovative use of studio technology for the time, with stereo panning from left to right and vice versa, along with other effects, such as slap echo, fuzzbox distortion, and reverb. There is some confusion as to whether Hendrix played a flute or a soprano recorder on this track. The credits list Hendrix as playing flute, but recorder player Rodney Waterman and Joe Vanderford of Independent Weekly refer to Hendrix's instrument as a recorder. Early music enthusiast Nicholas S. Lander maintains that \\"the high tessitura, the typical 'breaking' between octaves, and other characteristics are more suggestive of a soprano recorder.\\" Compared to the other tracks on Axis: Bold As Love, \\"If 6 Was 9\\" suffers from an unusually large amount of tape noise, dropouts, and overall \\"rough\\" sound quality. According to Hendrix biographer John McDermott, the master tape used for the album was a quarter-inch open reel tape belonging to bassist Noel Redding, containing an early rough mix of the song. This technically inferior copy (intended for a home tape player) had to be used at the last minute since the album's final stereo master tape had been accidentally lost, and \\"If 6 Was 9\\" was the one song that Hendrix and engineer Eddie Kramer could not satisfactorily remix. They reportedly had to use a clothes iron to remove wrinkles in the badly mishandled tape, copied it onto new studio-quality tape, and inserted it into the final album master with no further modification. Interpretation The theme has been described as an \\"individualist anthem\\". The lyrics portray the underlying conflict of the counterculture of the 1960s: the \\"social and cultural dichotomies\\" between the hippies and the \\"white collared conservative\\" business world of the establishment. Beginning with a blues riff, the lyrics accompany a \\"spacey\\" free-form jam, with Hendrix epitomizing the existentialist voice of the youth movement: \\"I'm the one that's gonna have to die when it's time for me to die/so let me live my life/the way I want to.\\" Authors Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek believe the lyrics, \\"if the mountains fell into the sea\\" are a reference to the creation myth of the second world of Hopi mythology.Shapiro & Glebbeek 1995, p. 225 Frank Waters' Book of the Hopi (1963) was known to have influenced Hendrix, and many of his songs contain mythological themes and images related to Native Americans in the United States;Shapiro & Glebbeek 1995, p. 148 Hendrix himself was part Cherokee.Shapiro & Glebbeek 1995, p. 13 Various urban legends based on numerology have developed around the meaning of number 9 in the song and Hendrix's death in 1970.

The legal justification of capital punishment was found in Article 22 of the Fundamental Principles of Criminal Legislation, which stated that the death penalty was permitted \\"as an exceptional measure of punishment, until its complete abolition\\". According to Western estimates, in the early 1980s Soviet courts passed around 2,000 death sentences every year, of which two-thirds were commuted to prison terms. The death penalty was not applied to minors or pregnant women. History The first person to be sentenced to death by a Soviet court was Alexey Schastny, Admiral of the Baltic Fleet, on 21 June 1918. Conditional death sentences also occurred in the early 1920s. Decrees issued in 1922, 1923 and 1933 provided police with the right to carry out summary executions, but they were repealed in 1959. The death penalty was abolished on 26 May 1947, only to be reinstated in 1950. Capital punishment was extended to cases of first-degree murder in 1954. Capital crimes In addition to crimes such as high treason, espionage, terrorism and murder, the capital punishment was imposed for economic crimes, such as \\"the pilfering of state or public property in especially large amounts\\". The hijacking of a plane became a capital crime in 1973. =Economic crimes= Capital punishment for crimes against state and public property was reintroduced in 1961. During the same year, two foreign currency traders, Rokotov and Faibishenko, were retroactively sentenced to death and executed. By 1987, over 6,000 people had been executed for economic crime. The death penalty was generally applied if the crime involved sums exceeding about 10,000 rubles, though there was no fixed threshold. Several officials were executed for economic crimes as part of Yuri Andropov's anti-corruption campaign. Vladimir I. Rytov, a deputy Minister of Fisheries, was executed in 1982 for smuggling millions of dollars worth of caviar to the West. The director of Gastronom 1, one of Moscow's most prominent gourmet food stores, was executed in 1984 for corruption. The chairman of Technopromexport was executed in 1984 for \\"systematically taking big bribes\\". Bella Borodkina, head of the restaurants and canteens department in Gelendzhik, was sentenced to death for receiving $758,500 in bribes.

Russia retains the death penalty, but it is rarely used. There have been 4 brief periods when Russia has completely abolished the death penalty, in the 18th century Russian empress Elizabeth abolished it, but it was restored by the next emperor, Peter III of Russia; then, on 12 March 1917 to 12 July 1917 following the overthrow of the Tsar, 27 October 1917 to 16 June 1918 following the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks, and 1947‚Äì1950 after the end of the Second World War (Joseph Stalin abolished it in 1947, but he had restored it in 1950, and for this short period, the strictest punishment in USSR was penal servitude in GULAG for 25 years). Currently the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation envisages the death penalty for five crimes: murder with aggravating circumstances, assassination attempt against a state or public figure, attempt on the life of a person administering justice or preliminary investigations, attempt on the life of a law-enforcement officer, and genocide. On 16 April 1997, Russia signed the Sixth Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, but has yet to ratify it. There has been a moratorium on executions since 1996; no executions in the Russian Federation since August 1996 (except one in 1999 in the Chechen Republic, a former limited recognition state). In November 2009, the Constitutional Court extended the moratorium indefinitely pending ratification of the Sixth Protocol. The death penalty is still present in statutes.

The development was headed by the designer . It was developed under designation \\"Grach\\" in response to Russian military trials, which began in 1993. In 2003, it was adopted as a standard sidearm for all branches of Russian military and law enforcement, alongside the Makarov PM, GSh-18, and SPS. Design details An MP-443 Grach field stripped to its main parts The PYa is a high-capacity, double-action, short-recoil semi-automatic pistol. Barrel/slide locking is a simplified Colt‚ÄìBrowning design, similar to that found in many modern pistols (for example the SIG Sauer and Glock families of pistols); the breech end of the barrel is rectangular in shape, rather than rounded, and fits into matching locking grooves within the slide, near the ejection port. The slide stop lever can be mounted on either side of the weapon to accommodate both left- and right-handed users. Likewise, the manual safety is ambidextrous, with safety catches on both sides of the weapon, where it is manipulated by the thumb. It is mounted on the frame, below the rear slide grooves, and directly behind the slide stop lever. The hammer is partially concealed at the sides to prevent catching on clothes and equipment. The magazine release catch is located in the base of the trigger guard on the left side, where it can be manipulated with the thumb (right- handed users) or index or middle finger (left-handed users). The front sight is formed as a fixed part of the slide and is non-adjustable. The back sight is drift adjustable for windage (dovetail type), but this requires a tool. Both feature white contrast elements to ease aiming in low-light conditions. The standard magazine capacity is 17 rounds, fed from a double-column, two position feed magazine. Magazines with an 18-round capacity were produced after 2004. Though the grips of the pistol are polymer, the weapon is largely made of metal (stainless steel for the barrel, carbon steel for the frame and slide). It is chambered for the 9√ó19mm 7N21 cartridge, the Russian loading of the ubiquitous 9mm NATO pistol cartridge, which is broadly equivalent to NATO standard loadings,(itself an overpressure version of 9√ó19mm Parabellum) loaded to comparable pressure specifications.7N21 generates about 600 J muzzle energy, compared to roughly 450 J for standard 9mm Luger or 700 J for 9mm NATO. The 7N21 features a semi-armour-piercing bullet with a tempered steel core. Jane's Infantry Weapons. The weapon can also use standard 9√ó19mm Parabellum/9mm Luger/9√ó19mm NATO cartridges, including civilian loads such as hollowpoints for law enforcement (only full metal jacket bullets are permitted for use in military weapons).  Adoption in Russia  As of 2008, it was supplied only in small numbers to selected special forces units, presumably those in the North Caucasus. In October 2008 the Russian interior minister planned to equip more Russian police with PYa pistols.Mark Galeotti. New guns for Russia‚Äôs cops ‚Äì so what? // \\"In Moscow's Shadows\\", October 23, 2008. But due to financial problems and the fact the Makarov pistol is so plentiful in Russia, the Makarov remains as primary police service pistol in Russia. Mass production started in 2011. Officers of the Western Military District received weapons in 2012. Scouts of the intelligence compound, belonged to the Central Military District and stationed in Siberia, fully rearmed on Yarygin pistols in early 2015. The massive deliveries of PYa pistols to the Russian Armed Forces started in 2012. As of early 2016, several thousand of such handguns have been supplied. Officers are training to master the new firearms. Nevertheless, the PM pistol have not been brought out of service. It supposedly will have been finally replaced by PYas by 2019.

His dissertation was on The Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Currently, he is a professor in the Department of Hebrew Language at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, in Israel. For several decades, he has been one of the team of international scholars working on the Dead Sea Scrolls, particularly on the texts found in Cave 4 at Qumran. In 1979 Qimron was co-opted by John Strugnell, the editor-in-chief of the Dead Sea Scrolls publication team, to assist in completing long-overdue work on the Halakhic Letter (4QMMT) on which Strugnell had been working alone since 1959. The work on the fragments was eventually completed and published in 1994. Qimron was the first Israeli scholar on the team. During the late 1970s and the early 1980s, many scholars felt frustrated at the delay in publishing the Dead Sea Scrolls. It was generally known that most of the texts had been translated but still had not been available to researchers. Some also complained about the proprietary attitude of some of Strugnell's team toward the scrolls that they were working on, which made access to them difficult, if not impossible, in some cases. Hershel Shanks, of the Biblical Archaeology Society, decided that the reconstructions of the Dead Sea Scrolls should be made available to scholars. In 1992, he published the two-volume A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls. It included, without permission, material on the Halakhic Letter (4QMMT) that Qimron had been working on for some 11 years. Qimron had even given the document its title. Qimron decided to sue the Biblical Archaeology Society for breaching his copyright on the grounds that the research it had published was his intellectual property, as he had reconstructed about 40% of the published text. Such reconstruction is unique in the sense that if the original photographs had been given to 100 different researchers, that number of different reconstructions would be made. In 1993, Judge Dalia Dorner of the Israeli Supreme Court awarded Qimron the highest compensation allowed by law for aggravation in compensation against Shanks and others. A 2000 appeal in front of Judge Aharon Barak and colleagues against upheld the verdict. Publications * Elisha Qimron, John Strugnell et al. (1994) Discoveries in the Judaean Desert Volume X.

After experiencing chronic illness throughout her childhood and adolescence, she launched a campaign against the use of pesticides in industrial agriculture. Early life In 1983, Downs moved with her family from Pagham, West Sussex, to a house next to agricultural fields near Chichester. The nearest field adjoining the house and garden was initially used for grazing livestock, but shortly after she arrived, it was converted to arable land. According to Downs, over the following years, her health gradually worsened as the result of exposure to the pesticides used in the nearby fields. Medical tests at that time ruled out motor neurone disease and Parkinson's disease as the cause. UK Pesticides Campaign After researching the subject of pesticides and their effects on human health, Downs decided to challenge government regulations. In 2008 she challenged the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in the High Court of Justice, which ruled that the department did not comply with European Union regulations. The court ruled that Downs had provided \\"solid evidence\\" that residents had suffered harm to their health and that the existing approach to pesticide regulation in the UK was not, as DEFRA had argued, \\"reasonable, logical and lawful\\". DEFRA appealed the ruling, however, and it was overturned by the Court of Appeal in July 2009. The appeal judge, Lord Justice Sullivan, ruled that the High Court justice had substituted his own evaluation of the health effect of pesticides for the evidence provided by DEFRA. Downs said that the appeal judges had ignored the evidence that she had provided ‚Äî and that the landmark High Court victory had been based on. She stated that she would take the case to the European Court of Human Rights. In 2016 Downs launched a petition calling on the Prime Minister Theresa May to ban all crop spraying of pesticides near residents' homes, schools and playgrounds. The petition was signed by thousands of other rural residents also reporting adverse health impacts of crop spraying in their localities. The petition was also signed and supported by English barrister Michael Mansfield QC, along with other high-profile environmentalists including Stanley Johnson, Jonathon Porritt, Gordon Roddick and Ben Goldsmith, amongst others. Affiliations and awards Since 2006 Downs has been registered as a journalist with both the International Federation of Agricultural Journalists (IFAJ) and the British Guild of Agricultural Journalists (BGAJ). Downs won a British Environment and Media Awards (BEMA) in 2006, and was one of the winners at the inaugural Cosmopolitan Awards also in 2006 winning the Heroine award. She was awarded the Daily Mails first \\"Inspirational Eco Woman of the Year\\" and as part of the prize went to 10 Downing Street to meet with the then Prime Minister's wife Sarah Brown. In 2015 Downs was nominated for The Observer Ethical Awards to find the best green Briton. A report in The Guardian said her work \\"promotes a vision of a green and sustainable Britain where non-chemical and natural farming methods are widely adopted.\\" Other work Before starting her pesticides campaign full-time, Downs was a singer-songwriter, performing in various live acoustic venues including at the Kashmir Klub in London.

Its fame rests partly on its Romanesque architecture and partly upon the tradition that its crypt was the place of the marriage of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It stands adjacent to a Benedictine abbey, both dedicated to St Zeno of Verona. History St. Zeno died around 371-380. According to legend, at a site above his tomb along the Via Gallica, the first small church was erected by Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths. Erection of the present basilica and associated monastery began in the 9th century, when Bishop Ratoldus and King Pepin of Italy attended the translation of the saint's relics into the new church. This edifice was damaged or destroyed by a Magyar invasion in the early 10th-century, at which time Zeno's body was moved to the Cathedral of Santa Maria Matricolare: on May 21, 921, it was returned to its original site in the crypt of the present church. In 967, a new Romanesque edifice was built by Bishop Raterius, with the patronage of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor. On January 3, 1117, the church, along with most of the city, was damaged by an earthquake; the church was restored and enlarged in 1138. Work was completed in 1398 with the reconstruction of the roof and of the Gothic- style apse. Exterior =Fa√ßade= Details The church of San Zeno constituted the model for all subsequent Romanesque edifices in Verona. Built of cream-coloured tuff, the fa√ßade is divided into three vertical components, the central nave surmounted by a pediment and the two aisle with sloping rooflines, all supported upon small pendented blind arcades. The intersections of the three parts are marked by angled pilasters ending in foliate capitals below the pediment. Across the fa√ßade, at the level of the door lintel, runs a shallow arcade of paired arches, divided by thin paired colonettes identical to those found above in the rose window. The pink marble of the arcades contrasts with the light yellow stone of the fa√ßade. The fa√ßade is further divided vertically by shallow pilasters, passing visually through the colonettes and into the pediment. The triangular pediment defines the nave and creates a striking contrast with the tuff stone of the rest of the church's fa√ßade, being of white marble divided by seven pink marble pilasters. In 1905, graffiti designs for a large Last Judgement were discovered on the pediment. Central to the upper fa√ßade is a rose window, in the shape of a Wheel of Fortune, the work of one Brioloto, and one of the earliest examples in the Romanesque architecture of such a structure that was to become a particular feature of Gothic architecture. The outer rim of the window is decorated by six figures representing the vacillations of human life. The porch is from the 12th century with lions at the base of its columns which are symbols of law and faith. The spandrels of the exterior arch each have a bas-relief portraying St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist while above the arch are the Lamb and the blessing hand of God. Above the door is a lunette with scenes of the Veronese history of the time, including: The Consecration of the Veronese Commune, St Zeno stamping on the Devil, (symbol of imperial power) and St Zeno delivering a banner to the Veronese people. Under the lunette are bas-reliefs with the Miracles of St Zeno. The internal and external mensulae around the arch of the porch show the cycle of the months, which relate to the Wheel of Fortune of the window above. The portal is flanked by 18 twelfth-century bas-reliefs. They portray scenes from the New and Old Testament, together with episodes of the life of Theoderic: the duel with Odoacer and the King hunting a deer, a symbol of the devil in Theoderic's Legend. The sculptures associated with the porch, the portal itself, and those set into the wall to the right, depicting scenes from the Old Testament and the Flight of Theodoric, are the work of the sculptor Nicholaus and his workshop. The New Testament scenes and other historical subjects to the left of the porch are by a member of Nicholaus's workshop named Gugliemus. Their signature inscriptions are located over the lunette, in the background of \\"The Creation of Man\\" and on the cornice above the sculptures on the left. The bronze door is decorated with 48 square panels. The identities of all the figures portrayed is not known: they include Saints Peter; Paul; Zeno; Helena; Matilda of Canossa (who had patronized the abbey); and her husband Godfrey, as well as the unknown sculptor of the work. Other panels show the three Theologic Virtues and, in the eight smallest ones, themes connected to music. As for the dating, some of the panels were made by Saxon masters of Hildesheim in the 11th century, while others are from Veronese masters (according to some scholars, including Benedetto Antelami himself). =Bell tower= The bell tower stands as a separate building. It is 62 m-high and was begun in 1045 and completed in 1178. It is stylistically Romanesque like the church, having a central vertical belt of alternating tuff and brickwork bands. It is divided in floors by cornices and small tuff arches, and rises to a double-storied bell chamber with triple mullioned windows. It is surmounted by a conical spire with small pinnacles at each angle. The exterior is decorated with Roman sculptures. There were six bells in chord of F#, cast in the years: 1067, 1149, 1423, 1498 and 1755. Only four of them are still ringing on the bell tower. The treble, cast during the 8th century, is now displayed in the museum (see Veronese bellringing art). The nave Interior The interior of the church is on three levels with an extensive crypt on the lower level, the church proper and a raised presbytery. =Crypt= Since 921, the crypt has housed the body of St. Zeno in a sarcophagus, his face covered by a silver mask. The crypt has a nave with eight aisles the arches of which are supported by 49 columns, each having a different capital. On the entrance arches, the local sculptor Adamino da San Giorgio sculpted fanciful and monstrous animals. The crypt was restored in the 13th and 16th centuries. =Central church= The central church, known as Chiesa plebana, is of the Latin Cross layout with a nave, two aisles and transept. The aisles are divided by cruciform pilasters with alternating capitals with zoomorphic motifs and of Corinthian style. The walls above the colonnade are polychrome. The trefoil-arched wooden ceiling dates from the 14th century. Artworks in the central church include a Crucifix by Lorenzo Veneziano, a porphyry cup taken from a Roman bath-house, the octagonal baptismal font of the 13th-century, an altarpiece by Francesco Torbido and a 13th-century fresco of St Christopher. =Presbytery= Smiling St. Zeno, statue in the Presbytery The presbytery is raised on an arcade above the crypt which thus remains visible from the nave. The presbytery is accessible by stairs in the aisles. The High Altar houses the sarcophagus of Sts Lupicinus, Lucillus and Crescentianus, all Veronese bishops. On the left of the apse, over the sacristy's entrance, is a Crucifixion scene from the School of Altichiero, while in the small left apse is a red marble statue of St. Zeno of the 12th-century, which is the most venerated image in Verona. The most important artwork of the basilica is the polyptych by Andrea Mantegna, known as San Zeno Altarpiece. Only the upper paintings are original, however, since the predellas, looted together with the former by the French in 1797, were never returned. =Church of San Procolo= Adjacent to the basilica is the small church of San Procolo, which houses the remains of Saint Proculus (Italian: San Procolo), the fourth bishop of Verona. It dates from the 6th or 7th century, being erected in the Christian necropolis across the Via Gallica. It is first mentioned however only in 845. After the 1117 earthquake it was totally rebuilt. It houses frescoes of various ages, including a Last Supper and St Blaise healing the Sick by Giorgio Anselmi. The 12th-century fa√ßade has a small narthex and two double mullioned windows. It has a single nave with a crypt, which is what remains of the original Palaeo-Christian structure. The crypt has a nave and two aisles. =The Abbey= Cloister at San Zeno Attached to the basilica is an abbey was erected in the 9th century over a pre-existing monastery. Of the original structure, destroyed in the Napoleonic Wars, only a large brick tower and the cloisters survive. It had originally another tower and the abbot's palace. For long time the abbey was the city's official residence of the Holy Roman Emperors. In the 1980s a restoration discovered frescoes from the 12th to 15th centuries.

In 1790, the Hopewell Presbyterian Church, which was also called the Hopewell-Keowee Church, was built in the Pickens District. Hopewell was the name of General Andrew Pickens's house on the Seneca River. Keowee was a common name for this section of the Seneca River in this period. The first church was a log building. Its location is on South Experimental Forest of Clemson University in Pickens County on Seed Orchard Road about 200 m west of West Queen St. This church burned in 1796. The ruins can be found at the edge of the forest. A monument was on the site until 1980 when it was moved to inside of Old Stone Church to prevent vandalism.Historical and Cultural Survey of the Clemson University Experimental Forest The congregation was given a tract of land for the new church by John Miller, who was a printer in Pendleton. Miller had been a publisher in England. In 1775, he and two partners were tried for libel because of their publications of the Junius letters in the London Evening Post. They were found not guilty. In 1782, Miller came to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1783, he moved to Charleston, South Carolina and began publishing a newspaper, Pendleton Messenger. After the Treaty of Hopewell, he was given 640 acres (259 ha) on Eighteen Mile Creek near Pendleton by Governor Benjamin Guerard. He or his son later deeded about 16.9 acres (6.8 ha) to the Trustees of Hopewell Church. The new church was constructed of field stone and mortar by John Rusk, who was the father of Texas Senator Thomas Jefferson Rusk, over the period from 1797 to 1802. It was a simple building with wooden pews and a pulpit. Early members of the church included Robert Anderson and Andrew Pickens. In 1824, the congregation built a new church, Hopewell- Pendleton, in Pendleton. After the new church was built, The Old Stone Church was only used occasionally. The congregation in Pendleton is now known as the Pendleton Presbyterian Church.Holder, Frederick C., Historic Sites of Oconee County, S.C., 2nd edition, Oconee County Historical Society, 1991, pp. 40-41.Brackett, Richard N., The Old Stone Church, Old Stone Church and Cemetery Commission & Pendleton District Historical and Recreational Commission, 1972.

De Marez Oyens was born in Velsen as Woltera Gerharda Wansink. She studied at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam with a major in piano, studying the instrument with Jan Od√©, and graduated in 1953 . Here, her talent for composition was discovered as she wrote her first pieces. These included chamber music and song cycles. After that she came in contact with youth groups, for whom she also wrote individual pieces. She then became the cantor of the Reformed church community of Hilversum. Because of this she was very busy with church music. She wrote 14 melodies for the church songbooks that appeared in 1973. The lyrics for these songs were supplied by, among others, Muus Jacobse, Willem Barnard and Ad den Besten, whom she knew personally. She wrote the melody for \\"Zolang er mensen zijn op aarde\\" by Huub Oosterhuis. Grave of Tera de Marez Oyens (centre) In the 1960s she became interested in electronic music, and studied with Gottfried Michael Koenig at the Institute of Sonology in Utrecht . Sound and Silence (1971) and Mixed Feelings (1973) are pieces of electronic music she composed, and Pente Sjawoe is an example of a work in which the tone poem plays an important role. In 1978 she became an instructor at the conservatory in Zwolle, where she taught until 1988 . Her lessons focused especially on the development of the student's own style. But she wanted to continue to write her own pieces and after the death of her second husband she became a full-time composer. At that time she wrote The Odyssey of Mr. Good-Evil (1981). In 1988 she contributed pieces to the international cello competition in Scheveningen, and in 1989 she was composer in residence at the Georgia State University in Atlanta. She wrote over 200 works of music, many commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Culture and various broadcasting networks. In 1995 she was asked to write a piece (Unison) for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations . She had been married to Gerrit de Marez Oyens and Menachem Arnoni.

The British Association for Immediate Care was founded as a charity in 1977 and combines bringing people together who have an interest in pre-hospital immediate care with supporting and promoting regional and local immediate care schemes across the UK. The organisation relies on volunteer medical professionals to provide healthcare assistance in support of the emergency services. It is registered as a charity, with two trading subsidiaries ‚Äì BASICS Education Ltd and BASICS Trading Ltd ‚Äì that are both registered as separate limited companies Purpose BASICS is an association of health care professionals, who undertake additional training as immediate care practitioners. The members provide their services in support of the statutory or voluntary ambulance services. Road Traffic Collision. BASICS members are used to provide extra skills at the scene of major incidents, or for particularly difficult patients. For this, individuals may be summoned on a case by case basis by the local ambulance control centre.  The Role of Affiliated BASICS Schemes  BASICS schemes across the country assist the ambulance service trusts where a multi-agency response is required at a local level, or additional skills and qualification levels are required. An example of this multi-agency response would be seen at an 'industrial accident' where for example a worker has become trapped in machinery. The ambulance service would work alongside the fire service to co-ordinate the rescue. Individual schemes can supplement the skill set available at scene with a medical doctor, nurse or critical care paramedics, who can provide skills outside the remit of most front-line paramedics. These supplementary skills include different methods of providing analgesia and, if necessary, surgical procedures which might be needed to extricate the patient. BASICS schemes may make use of all grades of first responder including doctors, critical care paramedics, paramedics and nurses alongside community first responders. =Local schemes= BASICS-affiliated schemes across the UK include: *Lincolnshire Integrated Voluntary Emergency Service *Suffolk Accident Rescue Service *SWIFT Medics Wiltshire *Mercia Accident Rescue Service *West Midlands CARE Team *Norfolk Accident Rescue Service (NARS) *MEDSERVE Waleshttp://www.medservewales.org *BASICS Essex Accident Rescue Service (BEARS)http://bearsmedics.org.uk *BASICS Devonhttps://www.basics-devon.org.uk *North Wales Emergency Doctors Service (NWEDS)https://www.nweds.org.uk *Bravo Medics History The 7/7 London Bombings. The British Association of Immediate Care Schemes was established in June 1977. Kenneth Easton, a General Practitioner, was the first chairman of the organisation. Initially it was formed from the existing schemes. The organisation then offered individual membership to doctors that had an interest in immediate care, such as those working in General Practice, Surgery, Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Anaesthesia and Critical Care. Associate membership was open to paramedics and nurses which later again changed to offering full membership recognising the changing roles of these professions . In 1991, the organisation increased their involvement in educational aspects, making available residential courses covering pre-hospital care and resuscitation. Around this time, it became clear that Scotland had different requirements to the rest of the UK, and BASICS Scotland was formed. In 1998, the organisation brought in a scheme for its members to have voluntary accreditation. Further support for the work of BASICS during major incidents came after the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The following year the British Medical Association announced their support for a series of training courses, over three years, to be organised by BASICS.

In 1908, Kedward was made minister of three Wesleyan congregations in Hull and earned the nickname 'the fighting parson' for physically protecting a woman from her wife-beating husband.Reynolds, op cit During the First World War, Kedward served in Egypt and France.The Times, 7 December 1923 He was invalided out of the army in October 1916 with 'trench fever' but served as president of ex-servicemen's associations after the war. Kedward unsuccessfully contested the Kingston upon Hull Central constituency at the 1918 general election, losing by a long way to a Conservative who had been favoured with the Lloyd George coalition 'coupon'. By then he had established a considerable local connection with Hull having been a minister of religion in the city for seven years and having founded the Kings Hall Brotherhood. He stood in Bermondsey West at the 1922 general election but was soundly beaten by the Labour candidate, a former Progressive (Liberal) member of the London County Council, Dr. Alfred Salter. At the next election in 1923, there was a straight fight between Kedward and Salter and Kedward was elected as the constituency's Member of Parliament (MP) by uniting the anti-Labour vote. He been associated with Bermondsey for some years having been Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Borough Council and a member of the Board of Guardians. However Labour surged back the following year, a year in which the Liberal vote slumped badly all over the country and he was defeated at the 1924 general election. Transferring his political allegiance to his original home area, Kedward stood at the 1929 general election for Ashford in Kent. He won a remarkable victory with a swing of over 20% from the Conservatives to the Liberals. During this time, Kedward was strongly associated with the National Tithe-payers Association, a group which campaigned against the collection of tithes by the Church of England mainly for the upkeep of the clergy and which was unevenly levied across the country, hitting some areas harder than others. In 1931, having sided with the Simonite faction in the Liberal party, Kedward fought Ashford as a Liberal National but was defeated as the local Conservatives refused to endorse his candidacy, seeing him as too radical and disliking his overt non-conformism (anti-tithe stance). They put up their own candidate against him. He was unsuccessful again at the 1933 by-election (this time as an anti-government Liberal) following his successor's elevation to the House of Lords. At the time of his death from the sudden onset of a duodenal ulcer at the relatively young age of 55 years, Kedward was superintendent of the South London Mission. His successor praised his energy and said that Kedward had worked himself to death serving his community.The Times, 6 March 1937 His grandson Roderick is a historian of 20th-century France.

She left Germany for good to live in London in October 1934.  Training, and first recitals with Nikisch  Elena Gerhardt was born at Connewitz near Leipzig, the daughter of a Leipzig restaurateur. She studied at the Leipzig Conservatory from 1899 to 1903, first with Professor Carl Rebling and then with Marie Hedmondt (d. 1941), who remained her friend and vocal adviser for many years. After a year of only technical study, she began work on operatic roles, such as Cherubino, Dorabella, the Mignon of Ambroise Thomas and Hermann Goetz's Katharina, interspersed with lieder. She won the Carl Reinecke Scholarship. Leipzig provided many opportunities to hear international artists and to hear the early masters. In 1902, Arthur Nikisch became director of the Leipzig Conservatory, and approved her to sing publicly in Leipzig, which she first did in November 1902: he also gave her a solo in Franz Liszt's \\"Choruses from Herder's Entfesselter Prometheus\\" (S. 69). On graduating in 1903 and with many engagements, she mentioned her wish to give a lieder recital, and Nikisch offered to be her accompanist, their first (victorious) performance being at the Kaufhaus in Leipzig on her twentieth birthday. Concert engagements poured in, and she sang lieder in almost every university town as supporting artist to names such as Eug√®ne Ysa√øe, Teresa Carre√±o and Max Reger. By 1905 she made her first appearances (with Nikisch) in Hamburg and Berlin (the Bechsteinhall), and in Berlin made the friendship of Richard Strauss. From summer 1905 she spent holidays with the Nikisch family near Ostend.  London, Europe, Russia, and USA before 1914  Gerhardt first appeared at the Leipzig Opera as Mignon, in June 1905, and also performed Charlotte in Massenet's Werther there, under Nikisch, being coached by his student Albert Coates as Korrepetitor. Nikisch arranged and accompanied her 1906 London debut, first in a Mischa Elman concert, and then in a lieder recital (songs of Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Wolf, etc.) at the Bechstein Hall. In April 1907 she first sang at the Royal Albert Hall, with an orchestra under Nikisch. Thereafter she returned to England annually until 1914 for autumn seasons, including regular tours of the provinces with Hamilton Harty or her loyal accompanist Paula Hegner. The partnership with Nikisch was preserved in two series of records made in 1907 and 1911 in Berlin. A particular triumph was their appearance in the 1908 season of the Philharmonic Society in London. She sang by invitation to entertain royal guests to the Coronation of King George V and Queen Mary in 1911. Nikisch introduced her into the highest circles, including the Villa Wahnfried. She sang in many European capitals - Vienna, Budapest, Prague, Copenhagen, Christiania (Oslo) - and with old musical Societies at Cologne and Frankfurt, annually in Paris and London, and under Mengelberg at The Hague. Nikisch usually accompanied the first lieder concert at each centre, after which other accompanists took over. Alexander Siloti arranged her first visit to Russia (to Moscow) in 1909, and until the War she sang there and in St Petersburg. Gerhardt made her American debut at the Carnegie Hall in January 1912, with Paula Hegner, and was then in Cincinnati and Philadelphia with Leopold Stokowski (singing the Wesendonck Lieder), and with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Max Fiedler, before finally combining there with Nikisch and the London Symphony Orchestra tour. In London in 1912 she performed the Angel in Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius, a role more associated with her 'rival' and friend Julia Culp. Her second American tour was in early 1913, opening with the Boston Symphony under Karl Muck, and with Erich J. Wolff as accompanist, who died during the tour. They visited Boston, New York, Baltimore, Washington and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Next season she sang in Paris, Moscow, Scandinavia, Hungary, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Scotland and England, culminating in London in July 1914 at the Queen's Hall under Richard Strauss - her last appearance there for eight years.  The First World War  Returning from Ostend to Leipzig in August 1914, her English tours were impossible to fulfil, but she sang from Hamburg to Vienna and Budapest and returned triumphantly to America in 1915, and that winter sang in Denmark and Norway. In August 1916 she sang to German troops on the Western Front at Laon, through the efforts of her brother the singer Reinhold Gerhardt, a pupil of Karl Scheidemantel. Meanwhile in late 1916 she returned to the USA to give the East Coast tour with Karl Muck, and in April 1917 was singing in Los Angeles and San Francisco. As America entered the war she was shipped back to Germany with many other artists. She visited the Front again in summer 1918 with Wilhelm Backhaus (in uniform) as accompanist and concert partner. She continued to tour, from Norway to Hungary, through the chaos following the armistice, and was in Munich when Kurt Eisner was assassinated.  Between the wars  In early 1920, she made a prolonged tour of Spain with Paula Hegner, and later that year to the USA again, where her collaboration with the model accompanist Coenraad V. Bos began. This partnership was renewed in the winter season of 1921-22 in New York. In March 1922 (soon after the death of Nikisch) she braved the return to London (Queen's Hall) with Paula Hegner, where her German art was received with an ovation. That was the start of an unbroken tie with England, which later became her home. The following years saw annual winter tours in USA (and the Pacific Coast from San Francisco to Vancouver in 1925), with extensive tours in UK, Europe and Germany. There were further Spanish tours, including one in winter 1928 with Bos. She was then singing Schubert's Winterreise which, as a female singer, she made particularly her own. At the start of 1929 she became head teacher of singing at the Leipzig Conservatory, and after October 1930 she discontinued her American tours, though still touring intensively in Britain and Europe. One of her students in Leipzig was Indian contralto Bina Addy.\\"Bina Addy Indian Contralto to Tour A. B. C.\\" The Wireless Weekly (February 5, 1937): 67. via Trove In 1928, she met and fell in love with Dr Fritz Kohl, Director of Administration of the Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk in Leipzig, and they married in November 1932. In London she reappeared before the Royal Philharmonic Society in January 1931, under John Barbirolli, to perform Wolf songs with orchestral accompaniment, and Mahler's Kindertotenlieder. Her Hugo Wolf Song Society recordings were made in 1932. Following Hitler's rise to power, Kohl was arrested and imprisoned, not being released until June 1935, the only one of the German Broadcasting Directors to be acquitted by the Reichsgericht in Leipzig. With the help of Landon Ronald at the Guildhall School of Music, Elena meanwhile got a foothold in London in 1934, and after a last visit to Bayreuth to see Strauss conduct Parsifal ('It was no longer Richard Wagner's Bayreuth, but Hitler's'Gerhardt 1953, 118.), London became the settled home of the couple. Over the following years, as the storm gathered, Elena gave recitals in the Netherlands, France and Britain, often with Gerald Moore accompanying, and developed a circle of singing pupils.  Wartime recitals in England  With the outbreak of war, Gerhardt expected that her singing career was at an end as there should be no taste for German music in Britain, especially as she would only sing in German, and the broadcast of the German language was forbidden on the BBC home programmes. However, Myra Hess insisted upon involving her in the National Gallery mid-day concerts, where she first appeared in December 1939, and afterwards in twenty-two concerts with Myra Hess or Gerald Moore, being very greatly appreciated. With Myra Hess and Lionel Tertis she sang the Brahms viola songs and other lieder recitals in many parts of England and Scotland, including a complete Winterreise in Reading, and in 1942 gave BBC lieder broadcasts to Argentina. Her teaching picked up again after 1941. With Myra Hess she sang at Haslemere for Tobias Matthay and his pupils. She gave a sixtieth birthday concert in the Wigmore Hall in 1943, and further National Gallery and Wigmore Hall concerts in 1944. News of the destruction of Leipzig and Dresden filled her with deep sadness.  Late career  In 1946, when the BBC Third Programme (i.e., Radio 3, the classical music station) was inaugurated, she gave three broadcasts, including lieder recitals and talks about her career and the interpretation of Winterreise. She also recorded Schumann's Frauenliebe und -leben in that year. She made a broadcast of Brahms's songs in May 1947. That was soon after her formal retirement from the platform in March 1947. Her husband Dr Kohl died in May 1947 and the remainder of her professional life was devoted to teaching in London, where one of her earliest pupils was Marina de Gabar√°in. She managed to arrange the escape of her brother Reinhold and his family from Eastern Germany, and he joined the staff of the Guildhall School of Music. Gerhardt was one of the very great interpreters of German lieder, a singer who made her career almost entirely in this genre. She published her autobiography in 1953. She died on 11 January 1961 aged 77, in London.  Recordings  (See discography by Desmond Shawe-Taylor, with titles and number listings. Dates may be of recording or of issue.)Gerhardt 1953, 173-180.

Japan Society North West organised a Japan Day in 2006, at Manchester Town Hall. This event was opened by His Excellency Mr Yoshiji Nogami, Japan's Ambassador to the UK, and Councillor David Sandiford, Lord Mayor of Manchester.

History After the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome and the Acad√©mies Royales in Paris, the Prussian Academy of Art was the oldest institution of its kind in Europe, with a similar mission to other royal academies of that time, such as the Real Academia Espa√±ola in Madrid, the Royal Society in London, or the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm. The academy had a decisive influence on art and its development in the German-speaking world throughout its existence. For an extended period of time it was also the German artists' society and training organisation, whilst the Academy's Senate became Prussia's arts council as early as 1699. It dropped 'Prussian' from its name in 1945 and was finally disbanded in 1955 after the 1954 foundation of two separate academies of art for East Berlin and West Berlin in 1954. Those two separate academies merged in 1993 to form Berlin's present-day Academy of Arts.  People  Most artists were associated with the academy as members. Membership was an honorary distinction extended to prominent domestic Prussian artists (after unification, German artists) and selected foreign figures as well. A 'deliberative' body of senators was chosen from the membership ‚Äì some elected, and some automatically included due to other rank. The academy was not a school, although it had associations with educational institutions, notably the state school that evolved into the present-day Berlin University of the Arts. =Directors= * Joseph Werner (16941710) * Blaise Nicholas Le Sueur (1756?1785) * Bernhard Rode (17851797) * Daniel Chodowiecki (17971803) * Johann Gottfried Schadow (18151850) * Anton von Werner (18751915) * Franz Heinrich Schwechten (19151918) * Max Liebermann (19201932) * Max von Schillings (19321933) History =1694 to 1799= The academy was founded to include painters, sculptors, and architects as members, reflecting the classical unity of the arts ideal.

Originally, they made high-capacity 14-inch drives, developed for mainframe computers, available for mini-computers and high-end workstations, but switched to 8-inch disk drives in 1980. Priam harddisk 72 MB Their 8-inch harddisks could be found in a wide variety of add- on products like the huge Mator Shark box with IEEE-488 interface for Commodore PET/CBM computers or the Priam DataTower series, external storage solutions, combining high-capacity hard disks and streamers in a single case, which could interface to various computers including IBM PCs. While Priam was considered a leader in certain technology segments at one time, they were late catching up in the transition to the 5.25-inch form factor and were ultimately one of the many hard drive manufacturers in the 1980s and 1990s that went out of business, merged, or closed their hard drive divisions; as a result of capacities and demand for products increased, and profits became hard to find. In 1985, Priam dropped their own 5.25-inch drive in-house development and merged with Vertex Peripherals, a company competing in the market for 5.25-inch drives. In the mid-1980s Priam's InnerSpace series offered fully integrated disk drive solutions to overcome disk capacity limitations imposed by MS-DOS prior to the release of version 3.31/4.0. This included custom hard disk controllers (based on Western Digital designs) as well as dedicated software for formatting (PFMT.EXE) and partitioning (EDISK.EXE). PFMT.EXE placed a driver EVDR.SYS into the root directory of the boot volume. This was used by DOS to retrieve drive and partitioning information located in the last 12 KB of the disk. Priam's EDISK also used dedicated MBR partition IDs 0x45 and 0x5C. Solutions were offered for DOS, NetWare, Unix and Pick. Priam opened a manufacturing facility in Taiwan in 1987 to move the production of 5.25-inch drives there. After having suffered losses since 1985, the company declared bankruptcy in 1989. It was re-established with the help of external investors as Priam Systems Corp. in 1990, led by Wil Cochran as president and Dick Reiser, a founder of Priam, as vice-president. Finally, the disk drive business was sold to Prima International of Santa Clara, California, a computer peripherals VAR, in 1991. Service was provided by Sequel.

Herd of Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica) The Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica), also known as the Altai ibex or Gobi ibex, is a species of ibex that lives in central Asia. It has traditionally been treated as a subspecies of the Alpine ibex, and whether it is specifically distinct from other ibex is still not entirely clear. It is the longest and heaviest member of the genus Capra, though its shoulder height is surpassed by the markhor. Appearance Siberian ibexes are large and heavily built goats, although individual sizes vary greatly. Males are between in shoulder height, and weigh between . Females are noticeably smaller, with heights between , and weights between . The nose is straight in profile, the neck short, and the back straight. The neck is also particularly thick and muscular in males, but much less so in females. Both sexes have beards, although the male's beard is more pronounced, and those of females are sometimes absent altogether. Both sexes also possess a large scent gland, about across, beneath the tail.Huffman, B. (2004). Capra sibirica. ultimateungulate.com The coat of Siberian ibex is well suited for camouflage in mountains with low or no vegetation.Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica) in Kargil, Ladakh, J&K;, India. The female's horns are relatively small, and grey-brown in colour, measuring an average of long. Those of fully- grown males are black and typically measure about , although in extreme cases they can grow to . Both sexes have circular rings around their horns that represent annual growth, but males also have large transverse ridges along the front surface. The exact shape of the horns varies considerably between individuals. The colouration is also variable, from dark brown to light tan, with some reddish individuals. There is usually a stripe of darker hair down the centre of the back and onto the tail, and some males have saddle-like patches on the back in the winter. The undersides are paler, and, in the winter, mature males becoming much darker with white patches. Females and infants are generally more bland in colour than the adult males, and do not always have the stripe down the back. Siberian ibexes typically moult between April and July, developing their paler summer coat, which continues to grow and become darker as the year progresses, reaching the full winter condition around December. Female Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica) near Kargil, J&K;, India =Subspecies= Though some recent authorities treat the species as monotypic, others have recognized four subspecies, based mainly on differences in total size, size of horns and colour of pelage: * C. s. sibirica - Sayan Mountains * C. s. alaiana - Alay Mountains * C. s. hagenbecki - western Mongolia * C. s. sakeen - Pamir Mountains, western Himalayas, and Afghanistan and Pakistan Reproduction The rut takes place from late October to early January. During the rut, the males spend considerable effort courting females, and they are often emaciated from lack of grazing by the time it ends. Courtship lasts for over 30 minutes, and consists of licking, ritualised postures, and flehmen if the female urinates. Males compete for dominance during the rut, rearing up on their hind legs and clashing their horns together. Gestation lasts 170 to 180 days, and usually results in the birth of a single kid, although twins occur in up to 14% of births, and triplets are born on rare occasions. Newborn kids weigh about , and grow rapidly during their first year. The horns are visible after about three to four weeks. They begin to eat grass as little as eight days after birth, but do not do so regularly until they are about one month old, and are not fully weaned until six months. Males are sexually mature at eighteen months, but do not reach their full adult size for nine years. Females first breed in their second year. Males typically live for ten years in the wild, and females for up to seventeen years. They have been reported to live for up to 22 years in captivity. Behavior Usually living at high elevations, sometimes at the vegetation line and well above the tree line, Siberian ibexes seek out lower slopes during the winter in search of food. They have also been known to seek out tree lines on hot days, but they do not enter forested areas, preferring to return to their alpine habitat when the weather has cooled. When snow is heavy, they have to paw away snow to reach the vegetation below. Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica) males feeding on bushes in Kargil, Ladakh, J&K;, India. Their diet primarily consists of alpine grasses and herbs. During spring and summer, grasses and sedges form the bulk of their diet, while during winter they eat more tall herbs, and the twigs and needles of trees such as aspen, spruce, juniper, and willow. During the summer, they often visit salt licks. Herds vary in size depending on the local population; about 5-30 is most common, although they can become much larger during the rut. Outside of the rut, most herds are single-sex, although some mixed-sex herds persist throughout the year. Herds spend much of the day grazing, spending an hour or more at each location before moving on. The main predators of Siberian ibex are Himalayan wolves, dholes, snow leopards, and brown bears; young ibex may also fall prey to lynxes, foxes, and eagles. A Siberian Ibex skull. Habitat and distribution Siberian ibexes live mostly above the tree line, in areas of steep slopes and rocky scree. Their habitat consists of a mixture of high altitude tundra, alpine meadows, and regions of semidesert. In the Gobi Desert, they may be found on hills as low as , but they are more commonly found between about in summer, descending to lower, sometimes sparsely forested, slopes during the winter. In Tajikistan, the ibex distribution is controlled by climatic variables such as seasonal temperature and precipitation of warmest quarter. Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica) rarely come close to human settlements. This picture was taken near irrigation canal, Indus river. Most Siberian ibexes are seen in central and northern Asia, Afghanistan, western and northern China (Primarily Xinjiang), north-western India, south-eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, eastern Uzbekistan, Mongolia, northern Pakistan, and south-central Russia.

Beginning in early 1940 under Khasan Israilov, it peaked in 1942 during the German invasion of North Caucasus and ended in the beginning of 1944 with the wholesale concentration and deportation of the Vainakh peoples (Chechens and Ingushes) from their native lands as well as from the locations across the USSR, resulting in the death of at least 144,000 civilians. However, scattered resistance in the mountains continued for years. Beginning  In late 1939, encouraged by the Soviet failures in the Winter War against Finland, Chechen ex-communist intellectual Khasan Israilov and his brother Hussein had established a guerrilla base in the mountains of south-eastern Chechnya, where they worked to organize a unified guerrilla movement to prepare an armed insurrection against the Soviets. By early February 1940, Israilov's rebels took over several auls in Shatoysky District. The rebel government was established in Israilov's native village of Galanchozh. They then defeated the NKVD's punitive detachments sent against them, capturing modern weapons. Israilov described his position on why they were fighting numerous times: After the German invasion in the USSR in June 1941, the brothers convened 41 different meetings in summer 1941 to recruit local supporters under the name \\"Provisional Popular Revolutionary Government of Chechen-Ingushetia\\", and by the end of midsummer of that year they had over 5,000 guerrillas and at least 25,000 sympathizers organized into five military districts encompassing Grozny, Gudermes and Malgobek. In some areas, up to 80% of men were involved in the insurrection. It is known that the Soviet Union used carpet bombing tactics against the revolutionaries, causing losses primarily to the civilian population. Massive Soviet bombing air raids twice targeted Chechen-Ingush mountain villages in the spring of 1942, completely devastating several auls and killing most of their inhabitants, including large numbers of elderly and children. By January 28, 1942, Israilov had decided to extend the uprising from Chechens and Ingush to eleven of the dominant ethnic groups in the Caucasus by forming the Special Party of Caucasus Brothers (OKPB), with the aim of an 'armed struggle with Bolshevik barbarism and Russian despotism'. Khasan also developed a code among the guerrilla fighters to maintain order and discipline, which stated: In February 1942, another Chechen ex-communist, Mairbek Sheripov, organized a rebellion in Shatoi and tried to take Itum-Kale. His forces united with Israilov's army relying on the expected arrival of the German Wehrmacht. In neighbouring Dagestan rebels also took the neighbourhoods of Novolakskaya and Dylym. The insurrection provoked many Chechen and Ingush soldiers of the Red Army to desert. Some sources claim that the total number of the mountaineers deserting reached 62,750, exceeding the number of mountaineer fighters in the Red Army. In fact, this figure refers to the whole North Caucasus for the whole period of the war. German support On August 25, 1942, nine German-trained saboteurs from Abwehr's Nordkaukasisches Sonderkommando Schamil landed near the village of Berzhki in the area of Galashki, where they recruited 13 local Chechens for their cause. Later in August and September, a total of 40 German agents were dropped in various locations. All of these groups received active assistance from up to 100 Chechens. Their mission was to seize the Grozny petroleum refinery in order to prevent its destruction by the retreating Soviets, and to hold it until the German First Panzer Army arrived. However, the German offensive stalled after capturing only the ethnic-Russian town of Malgobek in Ingushetia. The Germans made concerted efforts to coordinate with Israilov, but his refusal to cede control of his revolutionary movement to the Germans, and his continued insistence on German recognition of Chechen independence, led many Germans to consider Israilov as unreliable, and his plans unrealistic. Although the Germans were able to undertake covert operations in Chechnyasuch as the sabotage of Grozny oil fieldsattempts at a German‚ÄìChechen alliance floundered. That the Chechens actually were allied to the Germans is highly questionable and usually dismissed as false.Avtorkhanov. Chechens and Ingush. p183Wood, Tony. Chechnya: The Case for Independence.p36Gammer. Lone Wolf and Bear. p. 161-165 They did have contact with the Germans. However, there were profound ideological differences between the Chechens and the Nazis (self-determination versus imperialism), neither trusted the other, and the German courting of the Cossacks angered the Chechens (their traditional enemies with which they still had numerous land disputes and other conflicts). Mairbek Sheripov reportedly gave the Ostministerium a sharp warning that \\"if the liberation of the Caucasus meant only the exchange of one colonizer for another, the Caucasians would consider this [a theoretical fight pitting Chechens and other Caucasians against Germans] only a new stage in the national liberation war.\\"Avtorkhanov. Chechens and Ingush. p. 183. Deportation By 1943, as the Germans began to retreat in the Eastern Front, the mountain guerrillas saw their fortunes change as many former rebels defected to the Soviets in exchange for amnesty. On December 6, 1943, German involvement in Chechnya ended when Soviet counter- intelligence agents infiltrated and arrested the remaining German operatives in Chechnya. After the German retreat from the Caucasus, almost 500,000 Chechen and Ingush people from Checheno-Ingushetia as well as other republics were forcibly resettled to Siberia and Central Asia (mostly to Kazakhstan SSR) en masse, resulting in a large number of deaths among the deportees. Many of those who were not deported were simply massacred on the spot. In mountainous regions of the country, mass atrocities such as the Khaibakh massacre took place. By the next summer, Checheno-Ingushetia was dissolved; a number of Chechen and Ingush placenames were replaced with Russian ones; mosques and graveyards were destroyed, and a massive campaign of burning numerous historical Chechen texts was nearly complete.Gammer, The Lone Wolf and the Bear, p182Jaimoukha. Chechens. p212 Throughout the North Caucasus, about 700,000 (according to Dalkhat Ediev, 724,297,Ediev, Dalkhat. Demograficheskie poteri deportirovannykh narodov SSSR, Stavropol 2003, Table 109, p302 of which the majority, 479,478, were Chechens, along with 96,327 Ingush, 104,146 Kalmyks, 39,407 Balkars and 71,869 Karachays) were deported. Many died along the trip, and the extremely harsh environment of Siberia as well as of other regions the people were deported to (especially considering the amount of exposure) killed many more. The NKVD, supplying the Russian perspective, gives the statistic of 144,704 people killed in 1944‚Äì1948 alone (death rate of 23.5% per all groups), though this is dismissed by many authors such as Tony Wood, John Dunlop, Moshe Gammer and others as a gross understatement.Wood, Tony. Chechnya: the Case for Independence. page 37-38 Estimates for deaths of the Chechens alone (excluding the NKVD figures), range from about 170,000 to 200,000,Dunlop. Russia Confronts Chechnya, pp 62‚Äì70Nekrich, Punished PeoplesGammer. Lone Wolf and the Bear, pp166-171Soviet Transit, Camp, and Deportation Death Rates thus ranging from over a third of the total Chechen population to nearly half being killed in those 4 years alone (rates for other groups for those four years hover around 20%). In 2004, the European Parliament recognized it as a genocide. However, some rebel groups stayed in the mountains, continuing the resistance. Rebel groups were also formed in Kazakhstan. Israilov was betrayed and killed by two of his own men in December 1944. Following his death, the resistance was led by Sheikh Qureish Belhorev, who was captured in 1947. Several security divisions were sent to suppress the remnants of partisan movement, achieving this task only in the mid-1950s.

He helped design the church of Santa Maria in Trivio (1575). He also helped sculpt the tomb of Elena Savelli (1570) in San Giovanni in Laterano. In 1588, Del Duca returned to Sicily, and settled in Messina, where he completed a number of late mannerist structures, such as San Giovanni dei Gerolamini and the Loggia dei Mercanti. He died in Messina. Jacopo del Duca is a character in Manuel Mujica L√°inez's Bomarzo, a novel about the Orsini family and its sacred grove of monsters.

British Medical Journal 326: 1343-4. ECT was first used in the United Kingdom in 1939 and, although its use has been declining for several decades, it was still given to about 11,000 people a year in the early 2000s.Electroconvulsive therapy: survey covering the period from January 2002 to March 2002, Statistical Bulletin 2003/08. Department of Health. In contemporary psychiatric practice, ECT is used mainly in the treatment of depression. It is occasionally used in the treatment of other disorders such as schizophrenia. When undergoing modern ECT, a patient is given an anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant. A brief-pulse electric current of about 800 milliamperes is passed between two electrodes on the head for several seconds, causing a seizure.Lock T (1995) Appendix VI: review of ECT machines. In C Freeman (ed) The ECT Handbook. London: Royal College of Psychiatrists. The resulting convulsion is modified by the muscle relaxant. ECT is usually given on an inpatient basis; about one in five treatments are given on an outpatient basis. Treatment is usually given twice a week (occasionally three times a week) for a total of 6‚Äì12 treatments, although courses may be longer or shorter. About 70 per cent of ECT patients are women. About 1,500 ECT patients a year in the UK are treated without their consent under the Mental Health Acts or the provisions of common law.Care Quality Commission 2010 Monitoring the use of the Mental Health Act in 2009/10 : 89‚Äì93 Early years: 1938‚Äì1969 ECT was invented in Italy in 1938. In 1939 it was brought to England and replaced cardiazol (metrazol) as the preferred method of inducing seizures in convulsion therapy in British mental hospitals. Although soon established as especially useful in the treatment of depression, it was also used on people with a wide variety of mental disorders. There was large variation in the amount of ECT used between different hospitals. As well as being used therapeutically, ECT was used to control the behaviour of patients. Originally given in unmodified form (without anaesthetics and muscle relaxants) hospitals gradually switched to using modified ECT, a process that was accelerated by a famous legal case. =Origins of ECT= ECT originated as a new form of convulsive therapy, rather than as a completely new treatment.Berrios, GE (1997) The Scientific Origins of electroconvulsive therapy: a conceptual history. History of Psychiatry 8: 105-119. Convulsive therapy was introduced in 1934 by Hungarian neuropsychiatrist Ladislas J Meduna who, believing that schizophrenia and epilepsy were antagonistic disorders, induced seizures in patients with first camphor and then cardiazol.Mowbray RM (1959) Historical aspects of electric convulsant therapy. Scottish Medical Journal 4: 373-378. Meanwhile, in Rome, professor of neuropsychiatry Ugo Cerletti was doing research on epilepsy and using electric shocks to induce seizures in dogs.Cerletti U (1956) Electroshock therapy. In AM Sackler et al. (eds) The Great Physiodynamic Therapies in Psychiatry: an historical appraisal. New York: Hoeber-Harper, 91-120. Cerletti visited the Rome abattoir where electric shocks were used to render pigs comatose prior to slaughter. Inspired by the fact that the pigs were not actually killed by a voltage of 125 volts driving an electric current through the head for a few tenths of a second, he decided to experiment on a person. In April 1938 Cerletti tried ECT for the first time on a man who had been brought to his clinic in a confused state by police. The man was given a total of 11 treatments and recovered. It later emerged that he had had cardiazol treatment in another hospital three months previously. Cerletti called his treatment \\"electroshock\\" and developed a theory that it worked by causing the brain to produce vital substances that he called \\"acro-agonines\\" (from the Greek for \\"extreme struggle\\"). He put his theory into practice by injecting patients with a suspension of electroshocked pig brain, with encouraging results. Electroshocked pig brain therapy was used by a few psychiatrists in Italy, France and Brazil but did not become as popular as ECT. Cardiazol convulsion therapy was soon replaced by ECT all over the world. Cerletti and Bini were nominated for a Nobel prize but did not get one. =Early use of ECT in the UK= ECT arrived in the UK with Lothar Kalinowsky, one of Cerletti's assistants, who was on his way to the USA. Kalinowsky demonstrated Cerletti's technique at the Burden Neurological Institute (BNI) and wrote an article about ECT which appeared in the Lancet in December 1939.Kalinowsky L (1939) Electric convulsion therapy in schizophrenia. Lancet 234, 9 December: 1232-33. He said that electrically induced seizures were cheaper and easier to administer than cardiazol seizures. The first paper on ECT by British authors appeared three weeks later in the same journal.Fleming GWTH, Golla FL and Grey Walter W (1939) Electric convulsion therapy of schizophrenia. Lancet 234, 30 December: 1352-1355. Gerald Fleming, the medical superintendent of Barnwood House Hospital in Gloucester and editor of the Journal of Mental Science, psychiatrist Frederic Golla and neurophysiologist William Grey Walter (both from the BNI) described how they had tested the new method of convulsion therapy on five chronic schizophrenic patients from Barnwood House. Electrical parameters, technique of administration, seizures and electroencephalograms, but not therapeutic results, were discussed. An accompanying editorial entitled \\"More shocks\\" said that ECT \\"may well turn out to be a valuable step forward\\" but criticised Fleming's claim that the use of ECT required only minimal training, expertise and patient preparation. The editorial also queried Kalinowsky's dismissal of concerns about brain damage. \\"There is still a chance\\" it said \\"that the brain has nemo me impune lacessit for its motto.\\"Editorial (1939) More shocks. Lancet 234, 30 December: 1373. ECT soon became more popular than cardiazol convulsion therapy in mental hospitals in the UK.Mccrae N (2006)'A violent thunderstorm': cardiazol treatment in British mental hospitals. History of Psychiatry 17: 67-90. It was quickly identified as being especially useful in the treatment of affective psychosis.Brain WR and Strauss EB (1945) Recent advances in neurology and neuropsychiatry, 5th edition. London: J & A Churchill Ltd. The therapeutic value of ECT in schizophrenia was recognised as limited, but some psychiatrists saw it as useful to control the behaviour of institutionalised patients who had been diagnosed as schizophrenic. Some psychiatrists thought that ECT should be restricted to the treatment of depression;Allen C (1949) Modern discoveries in medical psychology, 2nd edition. London: MacMillan and Co Ltd. others used it in the treatment of a wide variety of disorders, for example, schizophrenia, epilepsy, neurosis, and hysteria.Hemphill RE and Grey Walter W (1941) The treatment of mental disorders by electrically induced convulsions. Journal of Mental Science 87: 257-275. It was also used on people who had suffered war trauma.Sargant W (1942) Physical treatment of acute war neurosis: some clinical observations. British Medical Journal, 14 November: 574-576. By the mid 1950s there was a 20 fold difference in the rate of ECT use in mental hospitals in the UK, and a similar difference in its rate of use in teaching hospitals.Barker JC and Baker AA (1959) Deaths associated with electroplexy. Journal of Mental Science 105: 339-348. In the 1940s and 1950s ECT machines used sine-wave current and patients were given a shock lasting a fraction of a second. Views on ECT were generally positive in the early days of its use. The Ministry of Labour ran a recruitment campaign for psychiatric nurses featuring a picture of someone undergoing ECT.Times, February 20, 1947, p7. Barnwood House, which catered for \\"ladies and gentlemen suffering from nervous and mental disorders\\", said in advertisements that it offered \\"all the most modern methods of treatment including electric shock and prefrontal leucotomy\\".Advertisement for Barnwood House. Journal of Mental Science, January 1948, page vii. There were however dissenting voices. Cyril Birnie, the medical superintendent of St Bernard's Hospital, Middlesex, raised concerns about persistent intellectual deficits following treatment and said that mental patients were \\"in danger of having a pretty thin time of it\\".Golla FL (1940) Electrically induced convulsions. Lancet 235, January 20: 127-128. =Anaesthesia= In the 1940s and early 1950s ECT was usually given in unmodified form, that is, without muscle relaxants, and the seizure resulted in a full-scale convulsion. An anaesthetic was used by a few psychiatrists but most considered it unnecessary as the electric shock produced instant unconsciousness.Kiloh LG, Smith JS, Johnson GF (1988). Physical Treatments in Psychiatry. Melbourne: Blackwell Scientific Publications, 190-208. ECT was even occasionally used to anaesthetise patients for psychosurgical operations.Freeman W (1948) Transorbital leucotomy. Lancet 252, 4 September: 371-37. A rare but serious complication of unmodified ECT was fracture or dislocation of the long bones, caused by the violence of the muscular contractions during the convulsion. In the 1940s psychiatrists began to experiment with curare, the muscle-paralysing South American poison, in order to modify the convulsions. The introduction in 1951 of succinylcholine, a safer synthetic alternative to curare, led to the more widespread use of modified ECT. A short-acting anaesthetic was usually given in addition to the muscle relaxant in order to spare patients the terrifying feeling of suffocation that can be experienced with muscle relaxants. By the mid 1950s most hospitals in Britain routinely used modified ECT, although a few still used unmodified ECT or ECT with muscle relaxants but without anaesthetic. In 1957 a patient who had sustained fractures to both hips whilst undergoing unmodified ECT at a London hospital took legal action. He lost the case but it had far-reaching consequences, encouraging a debate about ECT techniques which led to the abandonment of routine use of unmodified ECT in British hospitals.Barker JC (1958). Electroplexy (ECT) techniques in current use. Journal of Mental Science 104: 1069-78. The case is also famous for having established the Bolam principle. =Intensive ECT= Most patients in the early years of ECT were given treatment two or three times a week, or occasionally daily; a few psychiatrists experimented with more intensive treatment. At St James' Hospital, Portsmouth, William Liddell Milligan gave neurotic patients ECT up to four times daily. His aim was \\"to reduce the patient to the infantile level, in which he is completely helpless and doubly incontinent\\".Liddell Morgan W (1946) Psychoneuroses treated with electrical convulsions: the intensive method. Lancet 248, 2 November: 653. Robert Russell and Lewis Page tried a slightly different regime, giving patients one or two sessions of ECT a day but with several additional electric shocks during the convulsion. This treatment was given to over 3,800 patients at the Three Counties Hospital. Arlesey, Bedfordshire.Russell RJ, Page LGM and Jillett RL (1953) Intensified electroconvulsant therapy: review of five years‚Äô experience. Lancet 262, 5 December: 1177-1179. The Page-Russell technique was taken up by Scottish-American psychiatrist D Ewen Cameron who used it to \\"depattern\\" his patients at the McGill University in Canada.Cameron DE (1962) The depatterning treatment of schizophrenia. Comprehensive Psychiatry 3: 65-76. It later emerged that the CIA had put funds into Professor Cameron's work. In 1988 nine of his former patients received compensation from the US government; the Canadian government later compensated those patients whose treatment had not been funded by the CIA and court cases continue to this day.Canada to pay victims of mind-altering treatment.

Robert Russell set up a company, Ectron Ltd, to manufacture ECT machines.Russell RJ (1988) Stimuli used in ECT. In JC Malkin and S Brandon (eds) Current Approaches: ECT. Southampton: Duphar Medical Relations, 58-60. At one time nearly every hospital in the UK was equipped with Ectron machines.Pippard J (1992) Audit of electroconvulsive treatment in two National Health Service regions. British Journal of Psychiatry 160: 621-37. The middle years: 1960‚Äì1985 The next two and a half decades saw ECT maintain its place as a commonly used psychiatric treatment in spite of the introduction of neuroleptics, antidepressants and benzodiazipines into British psychiatric practice in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the early 1970s there were an estimated 50,000 courses annually in the UK; by 1985 this had dropped to about 24,000. This period saw stirrings of professional and public disquiet over some aspects of ECT use; in response the Royal College of Psychiatrists produced guidelines and carried out an extensive survey of ECT use. The Mental Health Act 1983 introduced a legal framework for the use of ECT on non- consenting patients. =Guidelines= In 1976 the Royal College of Psychiatrists received a request from the regional medical officer of the South East Thames regional health authority for advice on giving ECT to non- consenting patients. One of the region's mental hospitals had been the subject of a committee of enquiry, and the use of force when giving patients ECT had been criticised.Inquiry upholds complaints of grossly bad care for mental hospital‚Äôs patients. Times, 31 March 1976. In Parliament, Secretary of State David Ennals had referred to the death of one woman following ECT as \\"disturbing\\".Commons Hansard, 25 May 1976, oral answers, column 254. The Royal College of Psychiatrists duly produced guidelines, in the form of an eleven- page article in the British Journal of Psychiatry.Royal College of Psychiatrists (1977) Memorandum on the use of electroconvulsive therapy. British Journal of Psychiatry 131: 261-272 The guidelines summarised the current state of knowledge about ECT, set standards for its administration and discussed aspects of consent. ECT was, the guidelines concluded, an effective treatment for endogenous depression. There was less certainty about its value in mania, and little evidence for its usefulness in schizophrenia. The guidelines said that the possibility of long-term memory impairment following ECT had been \\"too little investigated\\". Recommendations for the administration of ECT included: anaesthesia for all patients, a pre-treatment physical examination, avoidance of currents greatly above seizure threshold and the use of machines with a choice of waveforms. The question of electrode placement was left open: evidence of less memory loss with unilateral electrode placement was noted, so too was psychiatrists‚Äô preference for bilateral electrode placement. The guidelines recommended that informal patients who were unable or unwilling to consent to ECT should be sectioned and a second opinion obtained (unless the need for treatment was seen as urgent). =Survey= In 1981 the Royal College of Psychiatrists published the results of an extensive survey into the use of ECT in Great Britain.Pippard J and Ellam L (1981). Electroconvulsive treatment in Great Britain, 1980. London: Gaskell. It revealed many psychiatrists ignoring the guidelines. ‚ÄúECT in Britain: a shameful state of affairs‚Äù read the title of a Lancet editorial on the results of the survey.Editorial (1981) ECT in Britain: a shameful state of affairs. Lancet 318: 1207-1208. Less than half of the clinics visited by the researchers met the minimum standards in the guidelines. In many clinics, ECT was being given by \\"bored and uninterested staff with obsolete machines operated by ignorant and uncaring psychiatrists\\". One clinic, where the staff used the phrase \\"old is gold\\" was using a 30-year-old machine mended with sticking plaster. A total of about 27,000 people received ECT in 1980. The authors of the survey estimated that ECT use had approximately halved since the early 1970s. There was wide regional variation, with the heaviest user, Jersey and Guernsey, using ECT at more than 5 times the rate of the lowest user, the Oxford region. There was a 17 fold difference in rates of ECT use between different hospitals and in many hospitals a large proportion of ECT was given by just one or two psychiatrists. Some psychiatrists didn't use ECT at all; others thought that the main, or even the only, indication for ECT was in psychotic or endogenous depression; yet others thought it appropriate in the treatment of a wide range of disorders. The median age of patients was mid-fifties. About 900 people over 80, and about 420 people under 20, were given ECT in 1980. 69 per cent were women. 21 per cent were treated with unilateral ECT. The survey found that a small number of clinics were still, in 1980, occasionally using unmodified ECT. That same year it emerged that ECT without anaesthetic had been used to control a patient's behaviour in Broadmoor Hospital; such use was defended by the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Department of Health.Commons Hansard, 26 January 1981, col 744-750. =Legislation= The Mental Health Act 1959 had given psychiatrists implied authority to treat detained patients without consent. The Mental Health Act 1983 gave psychiatrists explicit authority to treat detained patients without consent.Jones, R (1996) Mental Health Act Manual, 5th edition. London: Sweet and Maxwell. Psychosurgery and the surgical implantation of hormones to reduce male sexual drive were classified as irreversible treatments that could only be carried out on consenting patients (section 57 of part IV of the Act); ECT was classified as a slightly less serious treatment that could be given to non-consenting patients if certain procedures were followed (section 58). The patient had to be detained (if they were not already detained), then a psychiatrist from the Mental Health Act Commission had to authorise treatment. If the treating psychiatrist decided there was an urgent need for ECT it could go ahead without authorisation from a Mental Health Act Commission psychiatrist (section 62). ECT was not actually put on the face of the Bill, in recognition of the fact that some people thought it belonged in section 57 with irreversible treatments and a subsequent Secretary of State might wish to move it there.Commons Hansard, 18 October 1982, col 86. The Mental Health Act 1983 covers England and Wales. The Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 and the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 made similar provisions for the use of ECT on non-consenting patients in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Recent years: 1986-2010 The use of ECT in the UK has continued to fall, from about 23,000 courses in 1986 to about 11,000 in 2002. There is still marked variation in use, both in prescribing and in standards of administration. The Royal College of Psychiatrists produced three more sets of guidelines, and carried out two more surveys. The National Health Service produced guidelines on ECT use in 2003 and the following year the Royal College of Psychiatrists set up a voluntary accreditation scheme for ECT clinics. =More guidelines and surveys= The Royal College of Psychiatrists produced another set of guidelines in 1989, followed by a survey which showed that, although there had been improvements since the previous survey in 1980, many hospitals still failed to meet the standards set out in the guidelines. This time the survey was limited to East Anglia, and showed a 12 fold difference in the rate of ECT use between hospitals. Further guidelines appeared in 1995, followed by yet another survey with similar results. There were still problems with the training and supervision of doctors administering ECT; only a quarter of clinics were rated as good and two-thirds failed to meet the most recent standards.Duffett R and Lelliott P (1998) Auditing electroconvulsive therapy: the third cycle. British Journal of Psychiatry 172: 401-405. In 2004 the Royal College of Psychiatrists set up a voluntary accreditation scheme for ECT clinics. Two years on, only a minority of clinics in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland had signed up.Royal College of Psychiatrists (2006). ECTAS newsletter, issue 5. In 2003 the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, a government body which was set up to standardize treatment throughout the National Health Service, issued guidance on the use of ECT. Its use was recommended \\"only to achieve rapid and short-term improvement of severe symptoms after an adequate trial of treatment options has proven ineffective and/or when the condition is considered to be potentially life-threatening in individuals with severe depressive illness, catatonia or a prolonged manic episode\\".NICE (2003) Guidance on the use of electroconvulsive therapy. London: NICE. The guidance got a mixed reception. It was welcomed by an editorial in the British Medical Journal, but the Royal College of Psychiatrists launched an unsuccessful appeal.NICE (2003) Appraisal of electroconvulsive therapy: decision of the appeal panel . London: NICE. =Effectiveness and adverse effects= In 2003 the UK ECT Review Group, led by Professor Geddes of Oxford University, reviewed the evidence and concluded that ECT had been shown to be an effective short-term treatment for depression‚Äîas measured by symptom rating scales‚Äîin physically healthy adults, and that it was probably more effective than drug treatment. Bilateral ECT was more effective than unilateral, and high-dose was more effective than low-dose. Their conclusions were qualified: most of the trials were old and conducted on small numbers of patients; some groups (for example, elderly people, women with postpartum depression and people with treatment-resistant depression) were under-represented in the trials even though ECT is believed to be especially effective for them.The UK ECT Review Group (2003)Efficacy and safety of electroconvulsive therapy in depressive disorders: a systemic review and meta-analysis. Lancet 361: 799-808. A review of the literature found that between 29 per cent and 55 per cent (depending on the study) of people who had undergone ECT reported persistent memory loss.Rose, D et al. (2003). Patients' perspectives on electroconvulsive therapy: systematic review. British Medical Journal 326: 1363-1365. =Treatment without consent= Although the use of ECT on consenting patients fell by over a half between 1986 and 2002, its use on non-consenting patients remained constant at just over 2,000 people a year (in England and Wales).The Mental Health Act Commission (2003) Tenth biennial report, 2001-2003, 152. About two-thirds of those treated without their consent lack capacity, the rest are \\"capable but refusing\\".The Mental Health Act Commission (1999) Eleventh biennial report, 2003-2005, 240. As well as those treated under sections 58 and 62 of the Mental Health Act 1983, a small number of informal patients are treated without their consent under the common law. In 2002, just over one in five ECT patients had not consented to treatment. In Scotland the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 gave patients with capacity the right to refuse ECT.The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, Part 16, sections 237-239. In 2007 Parliament in London considered amendments to the Mental Health Act 1983, including one which would give capable people the right to refuse ECT in some circumstances.See for example, Lords Hansard, 15 January 2007; Commons Hansard, 18 June 2007. Section 58A of the Mental Health Act 2007 gives people who retain decision- making capacity the right to refuse ECT, unless their psychiatrist thinks they need it urgently. It came into force in November 2008 and led to a fall of about 23 per cent in the number of non-consenting patients.Care Quality Commission 2010 Monitoring the use of the Mental Health Act in 2009/10 : 90 References Electroconvulsive therapy in the United Kingdom Electroconvulsive therapy in the United Kingdom Category:British human subject research Electroconvulsive therapy History ","title":"History of electroconvulsive therapy in the United Kingdom"},{"id":"11799619","text":"Voulton is a commune in the Seine-et-Marne department in the √éle-de-France region in north-central France.

It is currently the northern terminus of the Dean Forest (heritage) Railway. History A 1911 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Parkend In 1864 the Severn and Wye Railway began operating small mineral trains on its existing tramroad, but they were not satisfactory and, in 1868, the company added a broad-gauge steam railway line. However, both were removed and replaced with standard gauge tracks by 1874. The station was constructed in 1873, and subsequently opened in 1875, to enable the company to also offer passenger services alongside its freight operations which, by now, had given the railway a sizeable presence in the village, including several sidings. A decline in mineral traffic and passenger numbers saw regular passenger services cease in 1929. The last goods train left Parkend on 26 March 1976 and much of the track was dismantled. The line was bought by the Dean Forest Railway Preservation Society, now based at Norchard. In 2004-2005 Parkend station was extensively reconstructed, and it reopened 26 December 2005. Diesel Railcars ran the service in December 2005 and then Steam services have run into Parkend since 25 March 2006. It was then officially opened, by the Princess Royal, on 19 May 2006. The station has two platforms, a water column, footbridge, goods shed (not in use yet), level crossing and a signal box (not in use yet). On the 'Down' Platform there is the main station building which has a ticket office and also sells some food & drink along with some gifts. Toilets are also part of this building. The level crossing gates at the north end of the station are reputedly the longest in Britain.

Early life Weinert was born in 1890 in Magdeburg to a family supporting the Social Democratic Party of Germany. He attended a boys' school in Magdeburg and, from 1908 to 1910, he visited the arts, crafts and trade school in the city and went to an art school in Berlin in 1912. He later joined the military, where he participated as an officer during World War I. It was during his time as a soldier that he was attracted to the revolutionary ideology. After the war, he went to Leipzig and worked as an actor and lecture artist, joining the Communist Party of Germany in 1929. Meanwhile, he made various works. Literary career Weinert started writing in 1921. From the very beginning, his poems were thoroughly anti-imperialist. In the second half of the 1920s, Weinert's work leaned towards portraying the struggles of the German proletariat. In 1929, he joined the Communist Party of Germany. Weinert's works were always political, and the role of political poet, agitator, and satirist were gradually assumed, as best seen in his collections Theater of the Apes (1925) and Erich Weinert Speaks (1930). Exile and fight against fascism Following the Nazi assumption of power, Weinert fled to Switzerland. From 1933 to 1935, Weinert, with his wife and daughter, Marianne Lange-Weinert, went into exile in the Saar protectorate. From there, he went to Paris, France, and so he would be able to arrive in the Soviet Union. Working in the Soviet Union, he published an anthology of anti-fascist poems in 1934, 'The Cobblestones and The Day Will Come'. He became a member of the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War from 1937 to 1939, where he was active as front correspondent. He turned his experience on the Spanish front into poems, which were published in the book Camaradas (1951). After Germany attacked the Soviet Union, Weinert sided with the Soviets and began creating propaganda to encourage soldiers in the Wehrmacht to abandon their positions using methods such as poems printed on handbills that were thrown off behind the German lines as well as making pleas to them via the radio. In 1943 he was selected as the president of the National Committee for a Free Germany. Once again the time spent on the front lines found literary expression. Weinert published his war diary under the title 'Remember Stalingrad' in 1943. Two short stories ‚Äì 'Death for the Fatherland' and 'Expediency' ‚Äì came out in 1942. A collection of leaflet poems written during the war came out in 1944 as 'Against the Real Enemy'. In 1947, he also published 'Chapter Two of World History: Poems About the Land of Socialism', an anthology of poems about the Soviet Union. Return to Germany In 1946 he returned to Germany in a sickly state. Regardless, he served actively as vice-president of the Central Administration for National Education in the Soviet Occupation Zone. In recognition of his work, he was awarded the National Prize in 1949 and 1952. He was also elected into the position of a member of the German Academy of Arts. He continued to publish works until his death at the age of 62 in 1953. Memorial plaque of Erich Weinert in Wilmersdorf, Berlin.

He is a Director of Leeds City Credit Union, and a Director of PAFRAS ‚Äì Positive Action for Refugees and Asylum Seekers, and until June 2009 was a National Executive Committee member of the Co-operative Party. Background Michael McGowan was born in the village of Birkenshaw in the West Riding of Yorkshire. His father, Edgar, was a baker at Bradford Co-op bakery and his mother, Marion, a waitress. McGowan was educated at Birkenshaw Primary school, Heckmondwike Grammar School, and won a West Riding scholarship to Leicester University where he read History, philosophy, Politics, and Economics. He is married to Margarita and they have three grown up children, Joseph, Emily, and Sebastian. The couple live in Leeds. Political career Michael McGowan was elected a Labour Party District Councillor at the age of 21, a West Riding County Councillor at 23, and has served for 2 periods on Leeds City Council. He was Parliamentary Labour candidate for Ripon in 1966 and for Brighouse and Spenborough in 1979. A former BBC Television and Radio producer based in Leeds, Bristol and at the Television Centre, London, McGowan is a member of the National Union of Journalists. European parliament In June 1984, having secured the nomination by defeating the sitting Member of the European Parliament, Derek Enright, McGowan was elected as the Labour MEP for Leeds, serving three terms in the parliament before he stood down in 1999. During those fifteen years, he served on the Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, and External Trade committees of the European Parliament and as Vice-President of the ACP EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly which links the European Union with the countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. McGowan has been a member of delegations to 37 African countries and was an EU election observer in Chad, Guinea, and Nigeria. He was a United Nations election observer at the Namibian independence elections in November 1989 and the first democratic elections in South Africa in 1994, when he was based in Durban. The South African city has since been twinned with Leeds, which Nelson Mandela visited and where he was made an honorary citizen. Michael McGowan is the only British MEP to be elected President of the Development and Co- operation Committee of the European Parliament, a position also held by the former French Prime Minister, Michel Rocard, and the present French Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner. Journalist In two op-ed pieces published in The Yorkshire Post during 2009, Michael McGowan has raised a number of controversial issues. One article called for an urgent independent inquiry led by the United Nations into the Lockerbie disaster. McGowan wrote that he was personally affected by the crash: \\"As President of the Development Committee of the European Parliament, I had invited Bernt Carlsson, the Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations and UN Commissioner for Namibia, to call in at Brussels in December 1988. That Bernt Carlsson was on that plane should be an extra incentive for the UN to take action in view of the fact that this impressive diplomat was dealing with some of the most sensitive and violent situations being perpetrated by the brutal apartheid regime in both South Africa and Namibia, besides his work in the Middle East. The best tribute to the lives and families of the 270 victims of Lockerbie, including Bernt Carlsson, and the most positive action for the international community to take against terrorism, is to launch an independent inquiry into this gross act of mass murder. Nothing less will suffice.\\" The second article by McGowan expressed the hope that Ireland would vote against ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, thus frustrating Tony Blair's ambitions to become President of the European Council. McGowan, fearing that ratification would nonetheless go ahead, argued in favour of a different British candidate for the presidency: Chris Patten, \\"who has to be rated as one of the more heavyweight and internationally respected UK politicians of recent times. His experience as a UK Government Minister, as European Commissioner for External Affairs with responsibility for international development, and the last Governor of Hong Kong would make him a serious candidate. The appointment of Chris Patten as the first President of the European Union would be good for Britain, good for Europe and good for the developing world. It would also signal a determination that Britain intends to play a greater part at the heart of Europe.\\" References Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:British male journalists Category:English people of Scottish descent Category:Labour Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:People from Birkenshaw, West Yorkshire Category:Labour Party (UK) MEPs Category:Councillors in Yorkshire and the Humber Category:Councillors in Leeds Category:Co-operative Party politicians Category:MEPs for England 1984‚Äì1989 Category:MEPs for England 1989‚Äì1994 Category:MEPs for England 1994‚Äì1999 Category:People educated at Heckmondwike Grammar School ","title":"Michael McGowan (politician)"},{"id":"11799701","text":"Y√®bles is a commune in the Seine-et-Marne department in the √éle-de-France region in north-central France.

She has lived in London for many years but has recently returned to Greece and now lives in Athens.  Style and themes  Rapi's writing focuses on power, desire and freedom. In an interview with The Scavenger she described her core themes in her latest trilogy of plays (Angelstate; Reasons to Hide; Kiss the Shadow) as being surveillance, censorship and power on the one hand, with intimacy, resistance and freedom on the other. In a more recent interview with Samuele Grassi, and regarding her aesthetic approach, she says: 'The place from which I write is very intimate and personal but the situations/dynamics, characters and stories I create are fictional and often intellectually worked out (the mental and the emotional are for me closely inter-linked.' & 'I do often use different media on stage, not only videos but live music and choreography...Text is of course primary.' Lizbeth Goodman analysing Ithaka, Rapi's first play,writes: 'It is this concept of transformative progressive freedom that provides the key to Nina Rapi's first play Ithaka, a play that looks at the darker side of sexuality...' & 'Ithaka explores the concept that individuals are constantly subconsciously attracted to conflict and domination...Most important, Ithaka is a dark comedy ‚Äì surreal in some aspects, bizarelly \\"realistic\\" in others. The tone of the piece is strikingly irreverent.' Samuele Grassi, analysing Rapi's more recent work (Angelstate, Lovers, Tricky, Josie's Restrooms) writes of 'Rapi's use of a multi-layered structure...focusing on freedom and/or desire as freedom.'  Plays  Nina Rapi's first play Ithaka was initially performed as a staged reading in 1989 at Riverside Studios by the Women's Theatre Workshop. Dimple Godiwala referring to Shadow,one of the key characters in the play, wrote: 'Shadow is where we begin to recognise the depths of sexuality (and otherness) we all possess...To invite an introspection which rests on the shadowed self we need to recognise that our sexualities, however they may have been moulded, are based on a certain opacity of self.' The play went on to get published in Seven Plays by Women, Aurora Metro, winner of the Raymond Williams award,1991;Seven Plays by Women, Aurora Metro,1991, , http://aurorametro.com/newsite/products-page/play- collections/seven-plays-by-women-female-voices-fighting-lives/ and to win Best Play Award at BITS Theatre Festival, Pirani, India, 1995.

It served the local park and lake, both near the station, and was the original southern terminus of the DFR from 1991 to 1995. History The halt was not an original station of the Severn and Wye Railway and was opened by the Dean Forest Railway on 8 September 1991. It was originally named Lydney Lakeside, taking its name from the lake behind the platform. From 1991 to 1995 it was the original southern terminus of the Dean Forest Railway prior to the reopening of Lydney Junction in 1995. It was later renamed St Mary's Halt in 1995 - which takes its name from St. Mary's Church, located opposite the platform. The halt was closed to passengers after the 2013 season, but was still used for the operation of the Bypass crossing until January 2016, when the crossing was automated. It will be removed within the foreseeable future for re-use elsewhere on the line. The Lakeside Extension, which involved the opening of Lydney Lakeside (now St Mary's Halt) was the first major extension that was undertaken by the Dean Forest Railway. The railway had been previously constrained to the Norchard site. To mark this event City of Truro visited the line, only one of two occasions that this has occurred at the DFR (the other in 2010 to mark the 200th anniversary of the Severn and Wye Railway). This section of the railway still retains some original features; mainly the cast iron lattice bridge, opened on 26 September 1892. Operation Services would always call when travelling to Lydney Junction (a necessity to operate the Bypass Level Crossing). After 2009 however services only called only on request heading towards Norchard, Lydney Town, Whitecroft, and Parkend until closure. In 1993, five services would operate each running day between April and October (a later service would run on Sundays, Bank Holidays, and other selected days). The first train would depart at 11:00 from the then new Norchard Low Level platform, with a journey time of 10 minutes to the Lakeside. A complete roundtrip would take 35 minutes. Special services would also run to the halt to provide access to Carol services at St Mary's Church opposite the halt. The train would wait in the platform to take the passengers back from the services, which always proved popular for the Dean Forest Railway.

It ran on Nostalgia Television (now Youtoo TV) from July 8, 1991 to May 28, 1993, with reruns airing sporadically for a number of years thereafter. Scott Sternberg was the host, creator and executive producer, while Charlie O'Donnell held announcing duties. The show is remembered for its a cappella, Doo-Wop style theme song and music cues, whose performers are unknown to this day. Rounds 1 & 2 In the first two rounds, the contestants faced a game board of five categories each with four questions that talk about each of the four decades (one question per decade). The player in control chose a category followed by the decade, then host Sternberg asked a question from that decade. The first player to ring-in had a chance an answer. A correct answer added points to their score, plus the right to choose another category & decade, but an incorrect answer subtracted points & gave the other players a chance to answer. These two rounds are identical to Jeopardy!. =Scoring= * Round 1 - +/-10 points * Round 2 - +/-20 points =Time Capsule= Also in the first two rounds, one decade in one category hid a special question called the \\"Time Capsule\\". The first player to choose that got a chance to answer the question unopposed for double value. A correct answer on that question added those points to his/her score, with no penalization if the player missed. A right answer also won a special memorabilia-type prize like a replica of KITT from Knight Rider, The Brady Bunch lunch box, or a Charlie's Angels board game. This was similar to the Daily Double on Jeopardy!. Decades Round In the Decades Round, the contestants were given a set number of answers according to their score. The player in first place needed to answer 4 questions. The contestant in second place needed five correct answers and the contestant in third needed six, identical to the Countdown Round on Split Second. Sternberg would read an event and contestants would attempt to guess which decade it occurred in. Each correct answer reduced the player's counter by one. The first player to clear their counter (make it to zero) won the game and $500 in cash. Notable contestants During the show's first season in 1991, Daniel Swartz appeared as a contestant, after a stint as champion on the short-lived 1990 version of Tic Tac Dough, and would later compete on Jeopardy! in May 1992. TV personality Ralph Garman, later host of The Joe Schmo Show and Family Guy voice-over artist, was a contestant during the show's second season in 1992. One of his opponents on that episode was veteran game show contestant John Gose, who had previously appeared on Password, Liar's Club, Split Second, Now You See It, Jeopardy!, The $25,000 Pyramid and Sale of the Century. Another veteran game show champion, Karen Levin (formerly Rachman), was a contestant during the second season; she had previously appeared on Name That Tune and Card Sharks, followed by a 1994 appearance on Shuffle: The Interactive Game, and more recently, she was the big winner on a special Oct. 2013 episode of The Price is Right which featured teachers playing.

Latinos were an untapped and highly lucrative market for which census statistics showed that 76 percent of the Latino population was either bilingual or monolingual in English.

The magazine was written in English, with some Spanish information for major features in the magazine. Lopez chose to print in English instead of Spanish because he felt that younger Latinos speak English more often. He also marketed the magazine as the first for Latinos in English.

S. \\"Bill\\" Heatly (September 3, 1912 ‚Äì February 25, 1984), was a Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives who served from 1955 to 1983. Known as the \\"Duke of Paducah\\", a reference to his hometown of Paducah, the county seat of Cottle County, Heatly wielded significant political power during his tenure in office.  Political career  First elected to the Texas House in 1954, Heatly had only four opponents during his subsequent twenty-eight years as representative of District 82 and then the nine-county District 80, which was reorganized in 1973 into the 15-county District 101. Heatly became a member of the House Appropriations Committee; in 1959, he was elevated to the chairmanship during the second term of Governor Price Daniel. In that position Heatly became one of the most influential and controversial figures in the legislature, and he seldom concealed the joy with which he wielded his power. He was credited with procuring increased funding in the state's mental-health programs, the prison system, programs for troubled and wayward youth, and cancer research and treatment. He also made several enemies because of his reluctance to spend state funds on what he considered \\"superfluous\\" programs and his generosity to favored institutions and agencies. Often Heatly was accused of using the appropriations bill to induce fellow legislators to vote his way. Many colleagues complained about his ruthless, domineering behavior, which included calling up influential people in their districts to put political pressure on them. Heatly, however, defended the practice by declaring that there was nothing wrong with \\"practical politics\\" and recommending that legislators be influenced by hometown voters instead of Austin lobbyists. Governor Preston Smith endorsed Heatly, and he obtained several state-funded projects for his district. His twenty-four-year tenure on the appropriations committee and the twelve he served as chairman both set records unmatched for at least another decade. Frustrated by the Legislative Redistricting Board's 1980 plan for West Texas counties, Heatly retired from politics in 1982 and returned to Paducah to \\"take some time to spoil his nine grandchildren.\\" He was succeeded by the Republican Anita Dorcas Hill (1928‚Äì2003) of Garland in Dallas County, in a renumbered and fully reconstituted district. Heatly was a thirty-third-degree Mason. He was also a past president of the Paducah Lions International and an elder in the Paducah First Christian Church. On February 25, 1984, he died in his sleep at his home from an apparent heart attack. He is interred at Garden of Memories Cemetery in Paducah.  Legacy  Heatly's son, Gene Heatly, served as 46th Judicial District attorney from 1977 to 1988. Another son, William H. \\"Bill\\" Heatly, also a Democrat, is the 50th Judicial District judge, having been elected in 2004. Heatly's grandson, J. Staley Heatly, was elected 46th Judicial District attorney in November 2006. The Brown-Heatly Building in Austin, which houses the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, is partly named for Heatly.

The translations of the Latin mottos are \\"Without skill art is nothing\\" and \\"While I lived I was silent‚Äîin death I sweetly sing.\\" The harpsichord was an important keyboard instrument in Europe from the 15th through the 18th centuries, and as revived in the 20th, is widely played today. This article gives a history of the harpsichord; for information on the construction of this instrument, its variant forms, and the music composed for it, see harpsichord. Origins The New Grove musical dictionary summarizes the earliest historical traces of the harpsichord: \\"The earliest known reference to a harpsichord dates from 1397, when a jurist in Padua wrote that a certain Hermann Poll claimed to have invented an instrument called the 'clavicembalum';The prefix clavi- means \\"with keys\\"; for cembalum see cimbalom. The harpsichord is called the cembalo in several languages. and the earliest known representation of a harpsichord is a sculpture (see below) in an altarpiece of 1425 from Minden in north-west Germany.\\"New Grove, online edition, article \\"Harpsichord\\" Boethius Whoever invented the harpsichord did not have to proceed from scratch. The idea of controlling a musical instrument with a keyboard was already well worked out for the organ, an instrument that is far older than the harpsichord. Moreover, the psaltery was a widely used instrument of the Middle Ages. Like the later harpsichord, it had metal strings which were held at controlled tension with tuning pins and transmitted their vibrations through a bridge to a soundboard, rendering them audible. The insight needed to create the harpsichord was thus to find a way to pluck strings mechanically, in a way controlled by a keyboard. The 14th century was a time in which advances in clockwork and other machinery were being made; hence the time may have been ripe for the invention of the harpsichord. The earliest known image of a harpsichord, from the 1425 altarpiece of the cathedral in Minden, Germany. The harpsichord is reversed in orientation in the original, not in the photograph. A second angel plays a psaltery. It is possible that the standard harpsichord mechanism, with jacks holding plectra mounted on retractable tongues, may only gradually have won out over alternatives. A Latin manuscript work on musical instruments by Henri Arnault de Zwolle from about 1440 includes detailed diagrams of three types of jack action, as well as a mechanism describable as a crude (and premature) predecessor of the piano action.See Stewart Pollens (1995) The Early Piano See also: Clavicymbalum. Another chain of development in the early harpsichord was a gradually increasing size. The psaltery was a hand-held instrument, far smaller than the fully evolved harpsichord. Early harpsichords were evidently small in both pitch range and string length. This can be seen, for instance, in the work of Sebastian Virdung, his Musica getutscht (Basel 1511). Virdung describes three instruments he calls the Virginal, the Clavicimbalum, and the upright Claviciterium. These had pitch ranges of 38, 40, and 38 keys, respectively, far smaller than later instruments. Frank Hubbard believed that all three must have been ottavini, meaning instruments that sound an octave above normal pitch. Since pitch range is linked to string length, an ottavino is one way of building a small instrument. Ottavini were also common later on in the early history of the harpsichord.Source for this paragraph: Hubbard 1967, particularly pp. 165-166 Italy The earliest complete harpsichords still preserved come from Italy, the oldest specimen being dated to 1521. (The Royal College of Music in London has a clavicytherium, lacking its action, which may be older.) Even the earliest extant Italian instruments represent an already well-refined form of the instrument, showing no traces of their more primitive origin. The Italian harpsichord makers made single-manual instruments with a very light construction and relatively little string tension. The Italian instruments are considered pleasing but unspectacular in their tone and serve well for accompanying singers or other instruments. Towards the end of the historical period larger and more elaborate Italian instruments were built, notably by Bartolomeo Cristofori (who later invented the piano). Flanders Flemish virginal (Paris, Mus√©e de la Musique) A major innovation in harpsichord construction took place in Flanders some time around 1580 with the work of Hans Ruckers and his descendants, including Ioannes Couchet. The Ruckers harpsichord was more solidly constructed than the Italian. Because the Ruckers workshop used iron strings for the treble, as a result the scaling (the length of the vibrating part of the string for a given pitch) was longer, (always with the basic two sets of strings; one 8-foot and a 4-foot), with greater string tension, and a heavier case, as well as a very slender and responsive spruce soundboard, the tone was more sustaining than the Italian harpsichords', and was widely emulated by harpsichord builders in most other nations. The Flemish makers of ca. 1600 were apparently the first to build two-manual harpsichords. They built them merely to permit easy transposition: the keyboards sounded the same strings, but one fourth apart.Hubbard 1967, 64-67 Thus, the player could effortlessly transpose at this interval (e.g., to accommodate a singer) by playing on the second manual. The Flemish harpsichords were often elaborately painted and decorated, and bore Latin mottoes.Hubbard 1967, 46 Fine instruments continued to be made by Flemish builders in the 18th century, generally along French lines, most notably by the Dulcken family. Another notable Flemish builder, Albert Delin, however continued making instruments close to the Ruckers tradition well into the latter half of the 18th century France Ruckers-Taskin harpsichord, (Paris, Mus√©e de la Musique) French builders were responsible for important further development of the Ruckers-type instrument. The first step, taken in the mid-17th century, was to change the purpose of the second manual in two- manual instruments: whereas in the Flemish school this had been for allowing the player to transpose, the French makers used the second keyboard to permit rapid changes (i.e., while playing) between different choirs of strings; in other words, they were \\"expressive doubles\\".Hubbard 1967, 105 The French harpsichord reached its apogee in the 18th century, notably with the work of the Blanchet family and their successor Pascal Taskin. These French instruments were founded on the Flemish design, but extended in range, from the roughly four octaves of the Ruckers instruments to about five octaves. The 18th-century French harpsichord is greatly admired and has been widely adopted as a model for the construction of modern instruments. A striking aspect of the 18th-century French tradition was its near-obsession with the Ruckers harpsichords. In a process called grand ravalement, many of the surviving Ruckers instruments were disassembled and reassembled, with new soundboard material and case construction adding extra notes to their range. A number of builders, Taskin included, constructed (often very fine) new instruments and passed them off as Ruckers restorations.Kottick and Lucktenberg (1997: 31, 55) A more basic process was the so-called petit ravalement, in which the keyboards and string sets, but not the case, were modified. England Virginal, probably English, late 17th century The harpsichord was important in England during the Renaissance for the large group of major composers who wrote for it, but apparently many of the instruments of the time were Italian imports. Harpsichord building in England only achieved great distinction in the 18th century with the work of two immigrant makers, Jacob Kirckman (from Alsace) and Burkat Shudi (from Switzerland). The harpsichords by these builders have been described by the famous builder-scholar Frank Hubbard as \\"possibly the culmination of the harpsichord maker's art\\".Hubbard (1966, 162) Visually, the instruments are considered very impressive, boasting a great deal of veneering and marquetry. Sheridan Germann writes of them, \\"English harpsichords must be acknowledged as great furniture, sumptuous in textures of wood and brass and fine joinery, and built to last forever.\\"Germann (2002, 90) A 1758 harpsichord by Kirkman, now in the Governor's Palace in Williamsburg, Virginia The sound of the Kirkman and Shudi instruments is described by the authors of Grove Dictionary as \\"enormously rich and powerful\\"; \\"whereas that of a French harpsichord may be compared to the sound of a woodwind ensemble, the tone of these developed English instruments, with their brilliant trebles and imposing basses, may be compared to that of a brass band. The sound thus lacks the subtlety of a French instrument but more than compensates by its volume and sensual impact. ... The sound of these instruments sometimes tends to call attention to itself rather than merely serving as a vehicle for projecting the music, a quality that may in abstract terms be viewed as a defect despite its splendour.\\"Quotation from the online Grove Dictionary, cited below; article \\"Harpsichord\\". The passage quote was written by Edwin M. Ripin, Howard Schott, and Charles Mould. A similar opinion was held by Frank Hubbard, who wrote: \\"For sheer magnificence of tone no other instrument ever matched them ... The only reproach that might be leveled against these instruments is that they are too good. The tone is so luxurious and characteristic that it almost interferes with the music.\\" Few modern replicas of the Kirkman/Shudi style instrument have ever been built; possibly because of the tonal issue just raised. Germann also notes that the solid construction of the original instruments means that quite of few of them are still in use today, lessing the demand for new ones. The Shudi firm was passed on to Shudi's son-in-law John Broadwood, who adapted it to the manufacture of pianos and became a leading creative force in the development of that instrument. Germany German harpsichord makers roughly followed the French model, but with a special interest in achieving a variety of sonorities, perhaps because some of the most eminent German builders were also builders of pipe organs. Some German harpsichords included a choir of 2-foot strings (that is, strings pitched two octaves above the primary set). A few even included a 16-foot stop, pitched an octave below the main 8-foot choirs. One still-preserved German harpsichord even has three manuals to control the many combinations of strings that were available. This represents the northern school of German harpsichord building as featured by builders such as Hieronymus Hass and Christian Zell. The southern school features instruments inspired by Italian harpsichord building: simple large double manual instruments, often undecorated, using brass strings and an Italian construction of the soundboard. These instruments were built by Michael Mietke, Heinrich Gr√§bner and the Silbermann family. Many modern builders have copied the Mietke instruments and they have proven to be an alternative to the French type harpsichord. center Obsolescence At the peak of its development, the harpsichord lost favor to the piano. The piano quickly evolved away from its harpsichord-like origins, and the accumulated traditional knowledge of harpsichord builders gradually dissipated. The old harpsichords were not valued, often destroyed (for example, they were used in the Paris Conservatory for firewoodFor further details see Hubbard 1967, 116.), and the instrument was something of a ghost for the duration of the 19th century. One exception is the continued use for recitative music in opera well into the 19th century, it was also used in basso continuoso because of its power to \\"cut through\\" the orchestra, the fact that it did not completely disappear from the public eye due to sporadic use in popular music (that persisted until around the turn of the century) played a role in revival efforts that began in the mid-19th century. However, by the late 19th century, despite revival efforts, its use even in the recitative style began to disappear and was rarely used in new basso continuoso pieces due to increasing orchestra size. The Pleyel \\"Grand Mod√®le de Concert\\", favored by Wanda Landowska Revival =Early stages= Interest reawakened around the dawn of the 20th century, and the harpsichord was gradually revived.Kottick and Lucktenberg (1997, 32) note a very early revival harpsichord by Pleyel, Wolff dating \\"from the 1880s\\"; it is in the Mus√©e Instrumental in Brussels A recurring theme in this revival has been the tension between the goal of authentic reconstruction of earlier instruments through rediscovery of old technology, and the use of modern technology‚Äîanachronistic, but often thought helpful in improving the quality of the instrument. An early authenticist was Arnold Dolmetsch, working early in the century in Surrey in England. Dolmetsch's efforts proved premature, as the first half of the century came to be dominated by modernist efforts. Such instruments, made for instance by the Pleyel firm of Paris, were heavily influenced by the modern grand piano, notably in using heavy metal frames, far sturdier than would be needed to support the tension of harpsichord strings. These instruments typically included a 16-foot stop to bolster their sound, following a (relatively unusual) practice of 18th-century German builders. Harpsichord scholar Edward Kottick has used the term \\"revival harpsichords\\" for this class of instrument, reserving the term \\"modern harpsichord\\" for the more historically authentic instruments that developed later. A notable player of the Pleyel revival harpsichords was Wanda Landowska, whose playing and persona greatly increased the popularity of the harpsichord in her time. A number of important 20th-century composers, such as Francis Poulenc, wrote works for revival harpsichords. The end of the Second World War brought new demand for harpsichords, and firms manufacturing the revival harpsichord prospered, notably Neupert, Wittmayer, and Sperrhake.Kottick (2003, 435) The revival harpsichord continued to evolve, even into the period at which it was being abandoned. Kottick and Luckenberg describe a 1970 Wittmeyer instrument, kept today in a Berlin museum, that incorporated amplification: \\"In an effort to give this huge but relatively quiet instrument some of the resonance the antiques had, it was equipped with an amplifier, and two speakers were built into the soundboard.\\"Kottick and Lucktenberg (1977, 80) =The harpsichord revival II: the authenticist movement= Starting around the middle of the century, the authenticist approach was given new impetus by the work of the builders Frank Hubbard and William Dowd, working in Boston, and Martin Skowroneck, working in Bremen, Germany. These builders based their construction on painstaking research: they took apart and inspected many old instruments and consulted the available written material on harpsichords from the historical period. These mid-century authenticist instruments proved very popular, and many other builders soon followed the example of Hubbard and his colleagues. As the authenticist movement developed, it grew ever more devoted to historical rather than revival-style technology. Plexiglas or metal upper and lower guides were abandoned for the historical wooden guides, heavy jack end pins were abandoned, piano-style keyboards were replaced by the lighter historical type,Kottick (2003, 440-441) and steel piano-wire strings were replaced by iron or brass. The authenticist instruments have largely vanquished the heavy revival instruments of the earlier 20th century.Kottick (2003, 451) asserted that revival instruments are no longer constructed, though as of 2014 a variety of revival harpsichords were offered for sale by the Neupert firm alongside its more authenticist offerings (). A kit-built Zuckermann \\"Z-box\\" harpsichord Since the late 1950s, harpsichords have often been constructed by amateurs from kits, a system pioneered by the American builder Wolfgang Zuckermann. The early Zuckermann kits were pragmatically rather than authentically designed, using plywood and straight \\"bentsides\\". They were an important force in increasing the popularity of the harpsichord. More recent kits have followed historical lines.

It follows the American boogie-woogie tradition of syncopated piano music. Background The title adopts 1940s' hipster slang coined by Raye's friend, Ray McKinley, a drummer and lead singer in the Jimmy Dorsey band in the 1930s. McKinley kicked off certain uptempo songs by asking pianist Freddie Slack (nicknamed \\"Daddy\\") to give him a boogie beat, or \\"eight to the bar\\". For that reason Raye gave a partial songwriting credit to McKinley. The song was formally published under McKinley's wife's name, Eleanore Sheehy, because McKinley was under a songwriting contract with another publisher. The nickname \\"Daddy Slack\\" was also used in the 1941 recording by \\"Pig Foot Pete\\" with Don Raye singing in Slack's band. It is commonly accepted by jazz historians that this song is in reference and tribute to Peck Kelley, a 1920s jazz pianist. The Will Bradley Columbia recording was also released on V-Disc as No. 489A by the U.S. War Department in August 1945. The song was first recorded in 1940 by the Will Bradley orchestra, featuring drummer McKinley on vocals and Freddie Slack on piano. The recording was re-issued by Columbia Records on its Hall of Fame series featuring landmark songs. Charts The single placed in Billboards \\"Leading Music Box Records of 1941\\" at number ten.

This knifefish is native to freshwater habitats in Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, but it has also been introduced to regions outside its native range. It is one of world's most invasive species. It is often seen in aquaculture and the aquarium trade where frequently confused with Chitala chitala; the latter species is very rare in the aquarium trade.Seriously Fish: Chitala ornata.

Distribution This species is native to Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, where found in the Mekong, Chao Phraya and Meklong river basins. It has also been introduced to regions outside its native range, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Myanmar, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Palm Beach County, Florida, United States.

Appearance Aquarium specimen showing the small ocellated spots on the lower rear body (towards the \\"tail\\") that are typical of adults The clown knifefish is very distinct, with normally silvery gray with a long knife-like body (laterally compressed) and a long anal fin that gives these fish their common name. Mature fish normally have five to ten (or even more) black spots ringed with white that usually decrease in size as the fish grows. These ocellated spots and the lack of faint stripes on the back separate it from Chitala chitala; a species it frequently has been confused with.Roberts, T.R. (1992). Systematic revision of the old world freshwater fish family Notopteridae. Ichthyol. Explor. Freshwat. 2(4):361-383. Albinos and leucistic specimens are seen with some frequency in the aquarium trade. Juveniles lack the spots, but are overall striped. Their long anal fins are used to make graceful forward and backward movements. The clown knifefish grows to a fairly large size, up to and in the wild. It has two nasal tentacles above its large, toothed mouth. In the center of the body is a flaglike dorsal fin and has no ventral fins. Behavior They are nocturnal and usually cruise during the twilight hours. They normally hunt live prey and will try any fish that fits into their mouths. Young clown knifefish usually school near water logs and plants for security, whereas more mature specimens usually become territorial and eventually become loners. These fish can also breathe air to survive in stagnant waters and little oxygen. The clown knifefish prefers water around neutral pH and temperature ranging from . These fish usually are found in lakes, swamps, and river backwaters. In the aquarium Clown knifefish are sold as exotic fishes in pet stores, but they grow much too large for the average home aquarium. These fish have periods of retreat, so aquaria which have caves, plants, or other hiding places are preferred. They are jumpers, so the lid should be kept tightly closed. Dim lighting may help lessen jumping. For the first few days, clown knifefish are shy and prone to hiding. As they grow larger they tend to be quite the opposite. =Feeding= Clown knifefish are hearty eaters, and will take live foods such as feeder fish, ghost shrimp, and blackworms. With time, they can be adapted to foods such as beefheart and will sometimes learn to accept commercial food pellets. They are mostly nocturnal, thus prefer feeding when the lights are off. As food The clown featherback is commonly seen in the cuisine of Thailand and other southeast Asian countries.

She is credited with coining the term \\"sex worker\\" and currently chairs the Sex Worker Film and Arts Festival and is the director of BAYSWAN, the Bay Area Sex Worker Advocacy Network. Biography Leigh was born in New York and grew up in Jackson Heights, Queens. She later attended Binghamton University (1968-70), Empire State College (1972-74), where she obtained a BA in creative writing, and Boston University (1974-75). In 1977 Leigh moved to San Francisco and started working as a prostitute. Two years later she was raped by two men at the establishment she worked at. She did not report this to the police for fear of the establishment being shut down. Leigh describes the rape as a defining moment in her life and prompted her activism for sex worker's rights. Leigh joined COYOTE and became involved in its activities, and through the Coalition on Prostitution coordinated a street outreach project for street workers in San Francisco. In 1983, Leigh wrote her one-woman satirical play The Scarlet Harlot, which she performed at that year's National Festival of Women's Theater in Santa Cruz. She has since performed the play in at clubs, theaters, rallies and as part of the Sex Workers Art Show tour. During the AIDS crisis in the early 1980s, Leigh was an advocate for safe sex but opposed mandatory HIV testing. Leigh decided to leave San Francisco, where HIV was dominating everybody's thoughts and headed to Texas where she intended to form an organisation: T.W.A.T. (\\"Texas Whores And Tricks\\"). During the journey to Texas her car broke down in Tucson, Arizona. Whilst in Tucson she answered a classified small-ad from media-life-artist Dennis Williams, who had a weekly 2 hour live comedy programme on Tucson Western International Television. Leigh joined the show and created and developed several characters for it. After two years Leigh decided she needed a more bohemian setting to develop her individuality and returned to San Francisco. On her return to San Francisco, Leigh joined the AIDS activist organisation Citizens For Medical Justice and organised demos and press conferences. She also collaborated with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. Leigh has been making videos since 1985, and has received awards from the American Film Institute for Yes Means Yes, No Means No; Outlaw Poverty, Not Prostitutes and Mother's Mink. The San Francisco Sex Worker Film and Arts Festival was founded by Leigh in 1999, which she also co- produces with Erica Elena and Jovelyn Richards. From 1993, Leigh was one of the main contributors to the San Francisco Task Force on Prostitution, who's report calling for the decriminalization of prostitution was published in 1996. In 2006 Leigh received a grant from the Creative Work Fund to establish, in collaboration with the Center for Sex & Culture, the Sex Worker Media Library. Leigh currently lives in San Francisco and is bisexual. The term \\"sex worker\\" She is credited with coining the term \\"sex worker\\" at a Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media conference in the late 1970s. The terminology used at the conference for the sex industry was the ‚ÄúSex Use Industry‚Äù. The phrasing bothered her because it objectified sex workers and trivialized the agency they had when organizing their labor. She suggested that the panel be renamed ‚ÄúSex Work Industry‚Äù and began to use the term in her one-woman plays before the first published use of ‚Äúsex worker‚Äù appeared in a 1984 Associated Press newswire. She explains in a later essay named ‚ÄúInventing Sex Work‚Äù that > ‚ÄúI invented sex work. Not the activity, of course. The term. This invention > was motivated by my desire to reconcile my feminist goals with the reality > of my life and the lives of the women I knew. I wanted to create an > atmosphere of tolerance within and outside the women's movement for women > working in the sex industry.‚Äù Works =Books= * =Film appearances= As listed by WorldCat. * Annie Sprinkle's amazing world of orgasm (2004) * Annie Sprinkle's Herstory of porn : reel to real * Dr. Annie Sprinkle's How to be a sex goddess in 101 easy steps (1992) * Mutantes : f√©minisme porno punk = Punk porn feminism (2011) (in French) * Mutantes : punk porn feminism (2011) * Our bodies, our minds (2005) * Released : 5 short videos about women and prison (2001) * Sphinxes without secrets : women performance artists speak out (1991) * Straight for the money : interviews with queer sex workers (1994) =Videos produced= As listed by Western Connecticut State University. * Die Yuppie Scum (1989) 30 min * Outlaw Poverty, Not Prostitutes (1989) 21 min * Safe Sex Slut (1987) 30 min * Spiritual Warfare: The G.H.O.S.T.* Campaign (1990) 28 min * Taking Back the Night (1990) 28 min * Whores and Healers (1990) 28 min * Yes Means Yes, No Means No (1990) 8 min * Whore in the Gulf (1991) 30 min  See also  *AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power References Bibliography  External links * San Francisco Sex Worker Film and Arts Festival * Sex Worker Media Library Category:Sex worker activists in the United States Category:American women's rights activists Category:HIV/AIDS activists Category:Bisexual writers Category:Bisexual women Category:LGBT writers from the United States Category:Living people Category:1951 births Category:American prostitutes ","title":"Carol Leigh"},{"id":"11800083","text":"Grishin () is a Russian surname derived from Grisha, a short form of the name Grigori.

She was a \\"wife, mother, and one of the earliest lay Dominicans\\". She was a \\"precociously pious child\\", running away at the age of seven to the forest to become a hermit. She was forced by her family to return home, and when she was 15, they forced her to marry wealthy nobleman Havel of Markvartice. He treated her brutally, but she was eventually able to perform acts of charity, give refuge to the poor and dispossessed at their home, found and support two priories, and join the Third Order of St. Dominic as a layperson. She died in 1252. She is the patron saint of Bohemia, of difficult marriages, and of those who are ridiculed for their piety. Her feast day is January 1.  Life  Zdislava was from the town of Litomƒõ≈ôice in what is now the northern part of the Czech Republic, to a Bohemian noble family.Cruz, p. 191 Her devout mother was born in Sicily and came to Bohemia as \\"a member of the retinue\\" of Queen Kunigunde. During her childhood, Zdislava went with her mother to visit Kunigunde, who probably first exposed Zdislava to the Dominicans. She might have met St. Ceslaus and St. Hyacinth. Zdislava, a \\"precociously pious child\\", was \\"extremely pious from her infancy\\", giving money away to charity at a young age. When she was seven years old, she ran away from her home into the forest to pursue a life of prayer, penance, and a solitary life as a hermit. Her family found her, though, and forced her to return home. When she was 15, her family forced her to marry, despite her objections, the wealthy nobleman Havel of Markvartice, who owned Lembeck Castle, a fortified castle in a frontier area that was occasionally attacked by Mongol invaders. Zdislava and Havel had four children. Zdislava's husband was \\"a man of violent temper\\" and treated her brutally, but \\"by her patience and gentleness she secured in the end considerable freedom of action in her practices of devotion, her austerities and her many works of charity\\". She devoted herself to the poor, opening the castle doors to those dispossessed by the invasions. Hagiographer Robert Ellsberg stated that Havel tolerated her \\"extravagant charity\\" because she followed his wishes and wore the costly clothes fitting her rank and station and would indulge in his \\"extravagant feasts\\" with him. Zdislava had ecstasies and visions, received the Eucharist daily even though it was not a common practice at the time, and performed miracles; one account reports that she even raised the dead.Cruz, p. 192 Ellsberg reported that Zdislava donated to hospitals and built churches with her own hands. According to one story, she gave their bed to a sick, fever-stricken refugee; Havel \\"became indignant at her hospitality\\"Farmer, p. 464 and was prepared to eject the man, but found a figure of the crucified Christ there instead. Writer Joan Carroll Cruz called the incident a \\"miracle\\", but one account states that she replaced the bed with a crucifix. The incident \\"deeply impressed\\" Havel, though, and he relaxed the restrictions he had placed on her. Eventually, he allowed her to build St. Lawrence Priory (a Dominican convent for women), donate money to another convent for men in Gabel, a nearby town, and join the Third Order of St. Dominic as a layperson. Hagiographer Alban Bulter states, however, that \\"the alleged connection of [Zdislava] with the third order of St Dominic remains somewhat of a problem, for the first formal rule for Dominican tertiaries of which we have knowledge belongs to a later date\\". Shortly after founding St. Laurence Priory, Zdislava fell terminally ill; she consoled her husband and children by telling them that \\"she hoped to help them more from the next world than she had ever been able to do in this\\". She died on January 1, 1252, and was buried, at her request, at St. Laurence.  Veneration  alt= Shortly after her death, Zdislava is reported to have appeared to her grieving husband, dressed in a red robe, and comforted him by giving him a piece of the robe. Her appearance to him \\"greatly strengthened him in his conversion from a life of worldliness\\". According to hagiographer Agnes Dunbar, her room was still being shown to visitors to the Lembeck Castle into the 19th century. Zdislava was beautified by Pope Pius X in 1907 and canonized by Pope John Paul II in the Czech Republic in 1995. She is the patron saint of Bohemia, of difficult marriages, and of those who are ridiculed for their piety. Her feast day is January 1.Farmer, p. 465  References   Works cited  * Cruz, Joan Carroll (2015). Lay Saints: Models of Family Life. Charlotte, North Carolina: Tan Books & Pub. pp. 191‚Äì. .

It is 3480 meters above sea level and 110 kilometers from the city of Cuzco.Sillar (2013) pg 30 It also known as the Temple of Wiracocha, one of its constituents. Both lie along the Vilcanota River.Sillar, Dean and Trujillo (2013) pg 21 The site has experienced a recent increase in tourism in recent years, with 83,334 visitors to the site in 2006, up from 8,183 in 2000 and 452 in 1996. Estad√≠sticas de Visitantes de los Museos y Sitios Arqueol√≥gicos del Per√∫ (1992-2008) Layout The Inka site at Raqch'i was a primary control point on a road system that originated in Cusco and expanded as the Inka empire grew. It is located in a valley known for sacred sites.Suarez and George (2011) pg 106 Most of the Inka structures are enclosed by a 4 km-long perimeter wall, but just outside it, on the Inka road that entered Raqch'i from Cusco, an enclosure with eight rectangular buildings around a large courtyard was probably a tampu (a lodging house for travellers).Sillar (1999) pg 49 The administrative records from around the same time as the site indicate that this was in all likelihood such a place.LaLone and LaLone (1987) The complex of Raqch'i consists of several different areas each designated with a specific function. Some have noted that these buildings may have been for religious and administrative officials. Others speculate that these buildings, paired with the scale of defenses may have been used as barracks to house troops. Nearby are approximately 220 circular buildings, likely used as storehouses, called qullqas. On the nearby hillsides are irrigated terraces which were likely used to keep the qullqas full for those traveling through. Raqch'i also houses a nearby spring and a pool or bath in proximity to the Temple of Wiracocha which could have been used for rituals. It has also been mentioned that because of the dual religious and administrative purposes, that the Sun cult might have held the surrounding lands to keep llamas for sacrifice like a similar site called Mayobamba. =Defense= There is some evidence that there was a village on the same site before the Inka conquest, but that it was the Inka who built the defensive changes to the city. Raqch'i is located on a prominent ridge overlooking the surrounding valley which provides a natural defensive position. Just beyond the wall there is a large dry moat running along the edge of the ridge the site is situated on. This in addition to the natural defense of steep slopes indicates that there was a reason that the Inka wanted or needed this site to be extremely well protected. =Temple of Wiracocha= The most prominent structure is the Temple of Wiracocha, an enormous rectangular two-story roofed structure that measures by .Templo de Wiracocha , P.A. de Raqchi: Sitios Arqueologicos This structure consists of a central adobe wall some 18 to 20 meters in height with an andesite base. Windows and doors allow passage. It is flanked on each side by a row of eleven columns. The foundations measure for both the wall and the columns are classic high Inca stonework with the remaining height built of adobe.Sillar, Dean, Trujillo (2013) pg 21 Prior to its destruction by the Spaniards, the temple had what is believed to be the largest single gable roof in the Incan Empire, know having its peak at the central wall, then stretching over the columns and some beyond on each side. The largest gable roof on the Inca Empire and Pre-Columbian Americas know so far is located inside the Inkallaqta complex, however it doesn't have a peak at the central wall like in the Temple of Raqchi. The huge proportions of the Raqchi temple, and its prominence on the site explain why the whole complex is also sometimes referred to as the Temple of Wiracocha. The temple is the only Inka building for which we have an account of how people should walk through it. It is highly significant that the design of the building means that, on entering its two known doorways, progress of visitors is immediately blocked by a series of tall pillars that they are forced to walk around. If devotees took this as a suggestion as to how to proceed through the building, they would have begun to trace a path similar to a zig- zag motion. This could have been deliberate design; a way to express aspects of Inka cosmology in particular their relationship with Wiracocha. In processing through the temple, the devotees would have wound their way towards the statue of Viracocha, the volcano and the spring.Sillar (1999) pg 51 According to Inca mythology, Wiracocha came to the region the Inka called Kacha but the local people there did not recognize him and tried to attack him. When he saw this, he made fire fall from the sky and burn the hills around the people. The Kacha went to Wiracocha pleading forgiveness and he put the fires out and explained to them who he was. They built a wak'a (shrine) where Wiracocha had stood and gave him many offerings. When the Inka Huayna Capac passed by the province of Kacha he saw the wak'a shrine of Viracocha in the midst of the plain and he asked why it was there. The people of the province told him of the miracle that Viracocha had performed. He decided that the remembrance of this event should be greater and ordered the erection of the temple. =Living quarters= Adjoining the temple to the north are twelve living quarters which would have housed both priests and local administrators. The living area is divided into separate squared lots the largest of which is roughly 4x6m. All have niches in their walls which might have been used for storage, though some of the niches have cover posts, suggesting they may have held sacred objects. The storehouses =Storehouses= To the eastern side of the temple are 152 round qullqas in parallel lines, each measuring some in diameter.Depositos/Qolqas , P.A. de Raqchi: Sitios Arqueologicos These storehouses were used to hold grains, such as corn and quinoa, that would have been used for ceremonial purposes as well as pottery, woven cloth and military equipment.Sillar (1999) pg 50 The storehouses are also unique as unlike other structures throughout the empire they are not square cornered. The reason for this is unknown. =Qucha= The Qucha (Quechua for \\"lake\\") is an artificial lake fed by a spring through two sets of finely constructed stone fountains with a raised platform beside one of them. It is a central feature of the site that is overlooked by both the temple and the raised platform, and is fed by the two fountains, which are of a type that the Inka used in cleansing rituals and as a place to make offerings. Between the northern fountain and the raised platform archaeologists found a deep layer of ash that may have been the remains of burnt offerings made on or near the raised platform. This ash was possibly being stored prior to depositing it in the qucha and letting it wash into the Willkanuta River (a similar ceremony is reported for Inka Cuzco). In Inka cosmology, springs were often regarded as sacred, and the association with the temple and the volcano may suggest that the spring at Raqch'i, with its fountains, was conceived of as the place of origin of the K'ana people mentioned in the legend of Viracocha. According to one legend, after Viracocha caused fire to come down from the sky, he was taken from the people and the rivers dried up. As the people prayed and were beginning to die from want of thirst, Viracocha appeared before them in a white robe and a staff in his hand. He then thrust the staff into the volcanic rock which caused water to flow. \\"This is the most sacred spring in South America, the life-giving Waters of Vira Cocha where the Prophet once stood and thrust His staff into the lava to save a repentant nation from death.\\" Hansen, 160-163 =Fairground and baths= To the west of the temple is a large field, now used by locals for farming, that might have been a fairground or to hold overflow of worshipers from the temple itself. On the far western edge of this field is a set of baths similar to ceremonial baths at important sites throughout the empire.

It is one of many types of rust fungi affecting plants. Like many rust diseases, G. sabinae requires two different hosts to complete its life cycle from year to year. Juniper is the winter host and pear is the most common summer host. Spores (called aeciospores) are produced from the fungal lantern-shaped growths which protrude from the blisters on the underside of the pear leaf which become airborne and infect junipers. This fungus overwinters in swellings or galls on infected twigs and branches of susceptible juniper plants. In the spring after a rain or heavy dew, the galls on the juniper produce tiny dark horn-like growths that become covered with an orange-brown gelatinous mass called telia. The corresponding stage on the pear trees is known as aecia. The telia and aecia release wind borne resting or hibernating spores (called teliospores and aeciospores) capable of infecting susceptible pear leaves and Juniper respectively. Spores produced from the fungus-induced swellings on juniper stems can be infectious up to 6 km. The disease causes a yellow-orange spot that turns bright red on leaves of pear trees. The disease can be particularly damaging on pear, resulting in complete defoliation and crop loss if not treated. The fungus feeds on the living cells of the host plant and is not capable of surviving on dead plant material, and so must either alternate with a different host or produce resting spores to pass the dormant season. Pear rust is a regulated disease in some countries. Gymnosporangium telia macro IMGP0418.jpgTelia emerging from juniper bark Control Pruning out any infected juniper twigs and branches in winter and early spring can help reduce the spread of G. sabinae. The vulnerable point of the fungus lies in its usual inability once established on a tree to reinfect it. Generally, the fungus must cross over to the opposite tree host. The most direct method of control is to exterminate junipers near pear trees. If there is a chance of infection, spraying pear trees with a fungicide in spring and summer (typically a systemic one that is certified as capable of dealing with rust) may help, although this is often not considered worthwhile.

The range has two distinct areas with the northern portion being primarily volcanic in origin, while the southern part of the range is primarily composed of metamorphic rock. McCullough Range was named after a pioneer settler. Wilderness Areas Some of the northern part of the range is designated as the North McCullough Wilderness Area by the US Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management while some of the southern part of the range is similarly designated as the South McCullough Wilderness Area. In addition the North McCullough Wilderness Area is within the newly designated Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area which allows further protection and enhancement. McCullough Range geography The McCullough Range is surrounded by three valleys. First, the Las Vegas Valley lies to the north; next, the north region of the Ivanpah Valley, with two major dry lakes borders the west; and to the east lies the endorheic basin of the Eldorado Valley. The range specifically borders one mountain range at the south, being connected to the northeast higher elevation foothills of the New York Mountains. Just northeast of the intersection of the two ranges, and in the southwest of Eldorado Valley lies the small Highland Range. Natural history =Northern= In the northern portion of the McCullough Range elevation spans from at the eastern base of the range to at Black Mountain. The peaks are volcanic in origin, rounded to flat-topped, and have a steep eastern escarpment and a gradual western slope. The area supports a unique combination of plants from the Mojave and Sonoran deserts and Great Basin Desert ecosystems. The primary vegetation is a creosote bush community with barrel cactus (Ferocactus cylindraceus), Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia), various chollas (Cylindropuntia spp.) and prickly pears (Opuntia spp.). Unlike other mountain ranges in Clark County, the McCullough Range is volcanic in origin. Examples of lava flows, ash falls and glassy zones are clearly visible. The area supports native black gramma grass (Bouteloua eriopoda), which is not known to occur anywhere else in Nevada and stands of teddy bear cholla (Cylindropuntia bigelovii), which is the northernmost extent of the species. Remarkable petroglyph panels and other important cultural resource features occur within the wilderness area. Another peak northeast of Black Mountain is home to most of the radio and television transmission towers for the Las Vegas Valley. =Southern= The southern portion consists of a north- south mountain range that drops off gradually to numerous valleys, foothills and sloping bajadas on the east and west flanks. Elevations range from in the northwest portion of the area to at McCullough Mountain in the center of the wilderness. Most of the area is composed of metamorphosed Precambrian rock, granite, and schist, although basalt and andesite flows occur in the northern reaches of the southern portion. Creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) scrub occurs below ; Joshua trees, Mojave yucca (Yucca schidigera), and other cacti occur between ; blackbrush occurs between ; pinyon-juniper occurs above . Scattered mesquite/catclaw communities also occur in washes throughout the area. Signs of prehistoric and Pre-Columbian habitation have been found in the area, including rock art, occupation and settlement sites, and pinyon pine nut caches. This was part of the historic homeland of the Mojave people. The desert tortoise, Nelson bighorn sheep, Gambel's quail and chukar are present.

Four or five such annular pulleys, together with three cruciate pulleys, form a fibro- osseous tunnel on the palmar aspect of the hand through which passes the deep and superficial flexor tendons. The annular and cruciate ligaments serve to govern the flexor mechanism of the hand and wrist, providing critical constraints to the flexor tendons to prevent bowstringing upon contraction and excursion of extrinsic flexor musculo-tendinous units. The first annular pulley (A1 pulley), near the head of the metacarpal bone, lies in the flexor groove in the deep transverse metacarpal ligament. As a general rule, the A1, A3, and A5 pulleys in the fingers are \\"joint pulleys\\" that originate from the volar plate on the volar aspect of the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and distal interphalangeal joints, respectively. The A2 and A4 pulleys arise from the periosteum on the proximal half of the proximal phalanx and the mid portion of the middle phalanx, respectively. The first annular pulley (A1 pulley), near the head of the metacarpal bone, lies in the flexor groove in the deep transverse metacarpal ligament. In the thumb there are two annular pulleys and a single oblique pulley. (\\"Mechanisms of Finger Flexion\\") Together, the A pulleys form a continuous tunnel and, because each A pulley's attachments on the bone is wider than its roof, its shape prevents the pulley from pinching its neighbours at extremes of flexion. The short roof also minimises pressure on the tendon under tension, instead distributing pressure throughout the tunnel.

In many programming languages, it is possible to check through type introspection to determine whether the type of the referenced object is indeed the one being cast to or a derived type of it, and thus issue an error if it is not the case. In other words, when a variable of the base class (parent class) has a value of the derived class (child class), downcasting is possible. Examples = Java = public class Fruit{} // parent class public class Apple extends Fruit{} // child class public static void main(String args[]) { // The following is an implicit upcast: Fruit parent = new Apple(); // The following is a downcast. Here, it works since the variable \`parent\` is // holding an instance of Apple: Apple child = (Apple)parent; } = C++ = // Parent class: class Fruit { public: // Must be polymorphic to use runtime- checked dynamic-cast. virtual ~Fruit() = default; }; // Child class: class Apple : public Fruit {}; int main(int argc, const char** argv) { // The following is an implicit upcast: Fruit* parent = new Apple(); // The following is a downcast. Here, it works since the variable \`parent\` is // holding an instance of Apple: Apple* child = dynamic_cast(parent); delete parent; } Uses Downcasting is useful when the type of the value referenced by the Parent variable is known and often is used when passing a value as a parameter. In the below example, the method objectToString takes an Object parameter which is assumed to be of type String. public static String objectToString(Object myObject) { // This will only work when the myObject currently holding value is string. return (String)myObject; } public static void main(String args[]) { // This will work since we passed in String, so myObject has value of String. String result = objectToString(\\"My String\\"); Object iFail = new Object(); // This will fail since we passed in Object which does not have value of String. result = objectToString(iFail); } In this approach, downcasting prevents the compiler from detecting a possible error and instead causes a run-time error. Downcasting myObject to String ('(String)myObject') was not possible at compile time because there are times that myObject is String type, so only at run time can we figure out whether the parameter passed in is logical. While we could also convert myObject to a compile-time String using the universal java.lang.Object.toString(), this would risk calling the default implementation of toString() where it was unhelpful or insecure, and exception handling could not prevent this. In C++, run-time type checking is implemented through dynamic_cast. Compile-time downcasting is implemented by static_cast, but this operation performs no type check. If it is used improperly, it could produce undefined behavior. Criticism Some languages, such as OCaml, disallow downcasting altogether. A popular example of a badly considered design is containers of top types, like the Java containers before Java generics were introduced, which requires downcasting of the contained objects so that they can be used again.

History Permanent communities of strangers segregated from the indigenous population had existed in Northern Nigeria and other parts of West Africa long before the arrival of the British at around 1900. Although living segregated from the Hausa population, residents of these communities were ultimately subject to the authority of the local emir. This has changed over the years as apart from Kano in northern Nigeria, the Sabon Garis are of mixed habitation. The establishment of British colonial rule under Frederick Lugard and the construction of new railway lines led to a large influx of laborers and traders from Southern Nigeria. The immigrants, which were mostly Igbo and Yoruba people, settled in new towns or Sabon Garuruwa, as these new towns were called by the local Hausa people. The Cantonments Proclamation of 1914 institutionalized this system of residential segregation. The Sabon Garuruwa became Native Reservations, officially reserved for employees of the government and commercial firms, and in practice inhabited by residents not indigenous to Northern Nigeria. British colonial rule in Northern Nigeria was indirect, leaving the emirs in power, albeit as part of the colonial administration. In the beginning the Sabon Garuruwa were administrated by the emirs. This changed with the Township Ordinance of 1917, which placed the Sabon Garuruwa and their residents under direct British rule. Sabon Gari residents were granted more rights than those under the administration of the local emir. For example, residents of a Sabon Gari could send representatives to the advisory board responsible for a township, or could choose between courts administering Muslim law or British law. Sabon Garuruwa were established in all major cities of Northern Nigeria, most notably in Kano, Kaduna and Zaria. One exception was Maiduguri, which never had a Sabon Gari. A typical city or town in Northern Nigeria would consist of the old city within fortified walls and inhabited by indigenous Hausa or Fulani people. The Sabon Gari would house immigrants mostly from Southern Nigeria. The Tudun Wada would house people from Northern Nigeria that were not indigenous to the local area. Europeans would live in the European Reservation Areas. Over time the initially strict residential segregation would partially break down. Eventually a typical Sabon Gari would house a diversity of people from all parts of Nigeria and to a lesser extent from other parts of West Africa. For example, in 1939 various ethnic groups were represented in the Sabon Gari of Kaduna as follows: 27% were Hausa, 11% were Igbo, 19% were Yoruba, 15% were Nupe and 28% were other ethnicities. Sabon Garuruwa today Even today Sabon Garuruwa are predominantly inhabited by people from Southern Nigeria. Ethnic tensions between groups from southern and northern Nigeria lead to frequent riots in the Sabon Garuruwa of northern cities. With the introduction of Sharia law in the northern states of Nigeria some Sabon Garuruwa with its predominantly Christian population have become the place of officially forbidden activities like alcohol consumption, gambling and prostitution.

The station broadcasts a music format featuring big band, swing and adult standards. KCEA is owned and operated by Sequoia Union High School District. History In 1979, Menlo-Atherton High School founded radio station KMAH, which broadcast local music and student programming. During off hours, the station broadcast a live audio feed of the Pacific Ocean from Fort Point, San Francisco. KMAH became KCEA (named after \\"sea\\") in 1983 and switched to its present big band music format in order to attract a wider audience and financial support. KCEA first broadcast local high school sports on January 8, 1999, when the station broadcast a Menlo- Atherton home basketball game. The October 11, 2013 broadcast of a football game between Sequoia and Terra Nova high schools was KCEA's 500th high school sports broadcast. Late in October 2018, the Sequoia Union High School District Board of Trustees discussed converting KCEA into a student run station in order to align the station closer to the district's educational mission.
