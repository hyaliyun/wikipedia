Composed primarily of buildings constructed in the middle of the nineteenth century, it has been converted into a park and designated a historic site. Active farmstead A family of Overmyers departed one of the German principalities to settle in Pennsylvania in 1751. One of the sons of this family, Phillip A. Overmyer, was born in 1823; after moving with his family to Washington Township in Sandusky County, Ohio at the age of ten, he married Margaret Waggoner in 1848, who had moved to the same vicinity in 1830. Besides farming, Phillip operated a sawmill and engaged in wagonmaking for many years. In 1862, the Overmyers erected a farmhouse on the present property; constructed of brick, it was built in the popular Greek Revival style of architecture. The family also arranged for the construction of barns and several other buildings on their property;Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1232-1233. seven historic buildings remain to the present day, including at least one that features elements of Gothic Revival architecture. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the Overmyer farm had passed into the ownership of a new family, the Roushes; this family owned the property and operated the farm for more than a century while transitioning from traditional draft animal power to modern mechanized equipment such as tractors. Before his 1999 death, family head Robert Roush operated the farm; his interests in conservation led him to attempt innovative techniques, such as establishing a tree farm and plowing his fields in circles to avoid damage to those fields.Murphy, Steve. \\"Park to Cultivate Farm Theme\\", The Blade, 2004-12-05. Accessed 2012-01-23. Conversion In 2004, Robert's widow Frances agreed to donate the farm to Sandusky County for conversion into a county park; besides the land and buildings, the donation included family journals and money to restore two dilapidated barns. Local officials welcomed the chance to convert the property into a park, due to its conservation potential. Among their premier interests was the tree farm: they saw it as significant because Roush had established it at a time when the typical Ohio farmer saw woodlots as nuisances that needed to be removed in order to make use of vacant land. This recognition was not the first that had been accorded to the farm: it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, qualifying both because of its place in local history and because of its distinctive architecture ‚Äî historians saw it as one of the area's best preserved nineteenth-century German family farms. After the donation was made, the Sandusky County Park District announced plans to build a visitor center on the property and to convert farmland along Muddy Creek into wetland, as well as restoring the farm's barns. Plans were announced to begin a program of historic farming: a local antiquarian group made arrangements to begin farming parts of the property with early twentieth-century equipment and to use modern equipment on other parts, in order to demonstrate technological change over the century. Presently measuring , the site is in the process of being developed by the Park District to resemble a farm of the 1930s through the 1950s. Although access to the buildings is restricted, visitors are free to hike on marked trails. Other activities sponsored by the Park District at the site include skiing, geocaching, nature watching, and metal detecting.Creek Bend Farm, Sandusky County Park District, n.d. Accessed 2012-02-08. In 2007, the Park District removed thirty-one ash trees from the property that were expected to be devastated by the Emerald ash borer, like others in northwestern Ohio. After milling, the wood was used as replacement flooring in the barn.\\"New Floor in Old Barn to be Rooted in Ash Trees\\", The Blade, 2007-03-28. Accessed 2012-02-08.

Fellow crime author, Ian Rankin, recognised the book in The Scotsman as one of his \\"books of the year\\" 2011. It was also listed by author Nick Quantrill as one of his \\"Top 5 Books of 2011\\". Plot The four-year-old son of Jack Caramac, a shock jock radio broadcaster and old friend of Dan Starkey, is kidnapped for one hour and returned unharmed. Starkey, now a self-styled \\"upmarket private eye\\", is hired to investigate the kidnapping and ascertain who might have been behind it ‚Äì a significant task given the number of people offended by Caramac's illustration of the crime and corruption prevalent throughout Belfast. Starkey's investigations lead him to the Miller brothers, officially the Chiefs of Staff for the Ulster Volunteer Force, although viewed by Starkey as merely a group of Shankill Road thugs intent on pedalling drugs across Belfast. The Millers have been attempting to evict a widow named Jean Murray from her house and Starkey intervenes, hoping his knowledge of their drug operation would dissuade any repercussions. Starkey's interference leads to the Murray's house being burnt down with Jean still inside. Characters * Dan Starkey; former well-known journalist turned private-eye. Starkey is currently living apart from his long-suffering wife, Patricia. * Patricia Starkey; Starkey's estranged wife * Jack Caramac; ex-journalist turned \\"shock jock\\" broadcaster * The Millers; UVF's chiefs of staff, cocaine dealers and general gangsters * Jean Murray; widow of a former gang member whose rivals were the Miller brothers * Bobby Murray; one-legged son of Jean, leg shot by the Millers * Tracey Caramac; wife to Jack and Starkey's old flame Reception The novel received universal acclaim, with reviewers praising Bateman's ability to create a likeable anti-hero and his comedic voice. Mike Ripley, reviewing for Shots magazine, did note that the similarities between this latest Starkey adventure and Bateman's more recent Mystery Man series appear to be quite significant, stating \\"there are [some] very scary similarities between Mystery Man ‚Äì a paranoid, anally-retentive, hypochondriac solidly double-parked on the wrong side of Aspergers Street ‚Äì and Starkey, not the least of which is their fondness for proprietary brands of confectionary\\". Ripley goes on to state that he found the ancillary characters to be a \\"splendid supporting cast\\" and that, of the novel as a whole, \\"once Nine Inches gets going... it turns into a dark, violent urban thriller\\". The novel was also reviewed by Maureen Carlyle for Shots, who opined that \\"if you can stand the extreme violence and the ripe language, this is a pacey tale, and you can't dislike Dan, no matter how hard you try\\". Reviewing for The Daily Telegraph, Mark Sanderson stated, of Bateman, \\"the biggest mystery about Nine Inches, a tale of kidnap and general cack-handedness, is why widespread success continues to elude him\\". Erin Britton, reviewing for Book Geeks was particularly effusive in her praise, stating that she found the novel to be \\"another excellent, darkly humorous crime novel from Bateman\\". She found the dialogue to be \\"great\\", the story to be \\"well-paced\\" and the novel to be \\"intricately plotted\\". Of Starkey, she stated that \\"while Starkey couldn't really be described as a likable character in the most obvious sense ‚Äì he has foibles upon foibles after all ‚Äì he is certainly charismatic and a great deal of fun to observe\\". Britton stated also that while \\"there is plenty of violence, sectarian and otherwise\\", \\"the story is actually rather emotional and melancholy in places\\". She found that, overall \\"Nine Inches is another excellent crime novel from Bateman, involving plenty of action, intrigue, mystery and downright bonkers characters\\". The Morning Star's Mat Coward also praised the novel, stating that Nine Inches \\"might be Bateman's funniest book so far\\" and going on to state that \\"the way he twists the jokes into the plot and the characters, rather than just pasting them on top like a layer of marzipan, is an object lesson in how to write comic crime fiction\\". The novel was well received in Ireland also. For The Irish Times, author Declan Burke stated that he found \\"the ex-paramilitaries Starkey encounters\\" to be \\"far more terrifying than those he outwitted when Bateman was writing during The Troubles\\". Burke found the novel to be \\"dotted with Starkeys blackly comic observations\\" and stated that \\"Nine Inches is an unsettling, breathless and very funny novel\\". The novel was also praised by Writing.ie with the reviewer finding that Starkey's \\"determination to have the last word or squeeze in one last quip is the hook that never disappoints\\" though states that \\"amid all the humour is a classic crime thriller plot\\". With respect to the story, the reviewer stated that \\"the plot twists and turns without ever leaving the reader behind; as with all Bateman books, the ending will always be a surprise without making any ridiculous leaps of logic. It will all make perfect sense\\" and concluding that \\"If you want a book that will keep you gripped and gripping your sides with laughter, look no further than Nine Inches\\". Further afield, the novel was well received by Sue Turnbull, in a review for 666 ABC Canberra, an Australian radio station. Turnbull, who had not read any Bateman novels before, stated, after reading Nine Inches, that \\"boy was she impressed\\". Turnbull recommends the novel \\"even if you've missed the earlier titles\\", stating \\"it's fantastic!\\".

It lies very close to the border with Yunnan, China, surrounded by mountains and rivers. Historically, Muang Sing has been a major producer of opium and still has problems with drugs and smuggling, due to its geographical position close to China and Myanmar. A notable Buddhist centre, with a dramatic growth in temples since the 1980s, it is popular with trekkers in northern Laos. History Not much is known about the history of the town before the 18th century. A walled settlement named Wiang Fa Ya was founded by the widow of the ruler of Chiang Khaeng and in 1792 she ordered the construction of a large stupa.Lao P.D.R.: M√ºang Sing The district of Muang Sing was the subject of a border dispute between the French and British for decades. The French set up a garrison here in 1896. Muang Sing was never formally incorporated into the kingdom of Xishuangbanna in the late-19th century and the ruler of Muang Sing, Chao Fa Sirinor, ruled the area as a semi-autonomous principality in the late 19th century. In 1885, Sirinor moved the capital of his Lue principality of Chiang Khaeng to Muang Sing, several kilometres to the southeast, bringing with him some 1000 Lue people. Because of its important position geographically, the people of the town have historically been on better terms with the Burmese, Thai, and Chinese people than the rest of Laos. However, it has continued to attract Lue pilgrims to its reliquary festival from Xishuangbanna since at least World War II due to its past. In 1904, Muang Sing was incorporated in French Laos after France and Great Britain made an agreement. In 1907, the Governor-General of Indochina in Hanoi issued a decree to establish the post of a \\"delegue du Commissaire du Gouvernement\\" at Muang Sing. It became part of French Indochina in 1916, but the locals continued to show discontent with the French occupation. In the first half of the 20th century, the French capitalized on the location of the town by using it as a weigh station and market to regulate their opium monopoly, Opium Regie, and control production by the Hmong and Mien peoples. By World War II, some 15% of the colonial revenue of the French was obtained through opium trading. When changes in the international situation after the war blocked off many historical trading routes, the French government encouraged Hmong farmers to mass-produce the poppies by some 800% to compete and maintain their monopoly. In 1953, however, Laos became independent from France and trading declined until the 1990s, when the opening of the country to tourism saw many people arriving in the area to smoke opium, leading to the reopening of drug dens. Geography and climate Muang Sing is in northwestern Laos in the northern part of Luang Namtha Province. The town lies about 60 kilometres northwest of the town of Luang Namtha, 77 kilometres northeast by road from Xieng Kok on the Burmese border and about 360 kilometres northwest of Vientiane. The district, which has jurisdiction over about 95 villages, borders Muang Long to the west and Muang Namtha to the east and Yunnan, China to the north. The district covers an area of 1650 km2, has a population of about 23,500 as of 2000 and a population density of 14.2 persons per km2. The terrain ranges in altitude between 540 in the lowlands to 2,094 metres in the highlands. Muang Namtha forms a valley of the same name with dramatic mountain scenery. Roughly half of the district lies within the Namtha National Biodiversity Conservation Area, also known as Nam Ha National Protected Area, a heavily forested area under national protection which extends much further to the southwest and includes the Pha Yueng Waterfall, about 17 kilometres south of the town of Muang Sing. The confluence of Nam Dai, Nam Sing and Nam Yuan is just to the northeast of the town of Mueang Sing. Due to its mountainous location at around 700 metres on average, the weather can be quite cool, rarely exceeding 30 degrees in the hottest part of the year in March‚ÄìApril and dropping to as low as 0 degrees Celsius in the coldest months, December‚ÄìJanuary. The monsoon season falls between May and October. =Villages= A selection of most of the villages in the district.

As of 2000 there were some 68 Akha villages, 26 Tai Lue villages, five Tai Neua villages, five Yao villages, three Hmong villages and one Tai Dam village in the district. These ethnic groups are classified in terms of elevation such as Lao lum (lowland Lao) and Lao sung (highland Lao). There are also many ethnic Yunnanese people in the area, mainly traders. The Akha which comprise about 45%, speak Tibeto-Burman languages and are mostly found in the rural parts of the district, especially the hills, and the Tai Lu, 30% of the people, form the largest ethnic group living in the main town.

The area is part of what is known as the Golden Triangle, one of the world's most productive and notorious areas for drugs and smuggling. A number of opium dens are known to operate in the area and in 2000, Laotian police confiscated 398,000 methamphetamine pills in a truck. Since 1992, political difficulties and territorial disputes between Laos and China has also led to increased trafficking of goods across the border including beer, cigarettes, fruit, rice, batteries and clothes. Tourism has also begun in Muang Sing, with both wealthy travellers and young backpackers, the main focus being to visit the remote Akha villages. Notable landmarks The principal temple of some 20 in Muang Sing is the Wat Sing Jai or Wat Xieng Jai, behind the Muangsing Guest House. The monastery, painted in hues reminiscent of the Caribbean, has a museum, but because its items are of high local value, it is closed to visitors for fear of theft. Another major temple is the Wat Namkeo. The wihan in the town are typically multi-tired roofed buildings typical of northern Laos, but most houses have corrugated metal roofs and wooden beams, reflecting a lack of wealth in the area. The Buddhas, however, are golden, and typically have large long earlobes, commonly seen in Xishuangbanna, China and Shan State of Burma.

Due to the increase in tourism in recent years, a number of small new hotels and restaurants have sprung up in the town, including the Phou Iu Guest House and Restaurant, built in 2003, Charmpathong, Muangsing Guesthouse, Danneua, Phou Lu, Saengdeuang and Singcharean, the largest hotel as of 2002 with 22 rooms Muang Sing's first eco-tourist resort was Adima, a hotel consisting of bamboo bungalows, about 8 kilometres north of the town. Culture Most of the houses in the district are built in the traditional style with wooden beams, raised off of the ground on stilts and covered with thatched/bamboo roofs. The locals, especially the Tam Dao and Tai Lue people, are adept at silk and cotton weaving. The Tam Dao weave sins (traditional Lao skirts), scarves and works of art. The Tai Lue cotton weavers in villages such as Nong Boua and Xieng Yun make dyes consisting of a blend of leaves, flowers, insects and wood and weave traditional cotton textiles. The women of the Akha ethnic group are also skilled at making heavy indigo-dyed cotton fabric, generally used to make bags, clothes and other souvenirs to sell to tourists. The Yao people are noted in particular for their needlework and embroidery and are skilled in making trousers, tunics and turbans. Between November to January, they produce a durable bamboo paper which is dried and later used as paper, primarily for religious purposes. The Hmong also manufacture embroidered clothing, bags and blankets for special ceremonies and festivals. The locals manufacture banners with bright colors such as orange, pink, blue, green, red and purple and often feature animals, humans and with Buddhist themes. The banners are typically 2 or 3 metres in length and 1 ft in diameter and are often adorned with beads, sequins, tassels, metal foil and paper. A notable local dish is Khao soi (English: \\"rice cut\\"), a Lao noodle soup, made by slicing a rice pancake into strips with scissors. Khao soi noodles are particularly popular among the Tai Lue and Tai Neua villagers, especially in the village of Ban Siliheung. The alcoholic drink Lao Lao is a staple of the locals, a rice beer made from fermenting and distilling rice in large steel drums. Ban Koum, four kilometres southeast of the main town on the road to Luang Namtha is noted for its whisky production. Since the 1980s, there has been a marked revival of Buddhism in Muang Sing and as of 2000, there was reported to be 21 temples in the district, most of them relatively new. In January 1996 Khuba Bunchum (1965-), a Buddhist teacher from Bangsa, built two stupas in the area.

Indian Army Harry Baxter was born a \\"child of the regiment\\" to the Royal Irish Fusiliers. Despite being blind in his right eye as the result of a childhood shooting accident in India he was determined to join the army in 1939. The medical officer who tested him was impressed to meet someone who was trying to cheat his way \\"into\\" the army that he passed him fit for the Indian Army.Doherty, pp. 37‚Äì8. He gave up a scholarship place at Oxford University and received an emergency commission as a 2nd Lt. in the Indian Army on 11 October 1942 with the number 363915. Baxter's service in India was mostly wartime and he served in Burma.Ryder, p. 69. His Emergency Commission was changed to a Permanent Commission in the British Army on 25 May 1946 when he joined the Royal Irish Fusiliers (RIrF) as a Lieutenant. =Royal Irish Fusiliers= In 1947 Baxter transferred to the RIrF on a regular (permanent) commission and served in Palestine, Egypt, Greece, Germany and finally Malaya where he was Mentioned in Despatches During this time he spent four years on Extra Regimental Engagement (ERE) to Lord Mountbatten's staff. Between 1963 and 1966 he was the commander of the North Irish Brigade's depot in Eglinton Camp County Londonderry and St Patrick's Barracks County Antrim and also spent a period as a staff officer with the Berlin Brigade before being appointed Brigadier UDR. He was appointed OBE in the 1968 Queen's Birthday Honours list.Ryder, p. 70. George Medal Baxter was awarded the George Medal for his actions at Gough Barracks, Armagh when, as a major, he and Captain Henry Chavasse removed a viable bomb from outside the armoury and drove it to a safe place for disposal. The detonator of the bomb exploded whilst it was in transit but the device did not explode.Ryder, pp. 69‚Äì70. =Ulster Defence Regiment= Baxter assumed command of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) in April 1973 from Brigadier Denis Ormerod. Like Ormerod, Baxter was a Roman Catholic commanding a locally raised and predominantly Protestant regiment during a time of intercommunal strife.Potter, p. 102. He was in command during the notable Ulster Workers' Council strike in 1974 which was considered to be a \\"turning point\\" in the regiment's history and \\"coming of age\\" comments listed by Major John Potter in his unofficial history of the regiment.Potter, p. 132. Having a brigadier as regimental commander was unusual in the modern British Army but the size of the Ulster Defence Regiment with its 11 battalions and over 9,000 men and women (at its peak) demanded an officer of higher rank than colonel. Baxter was the commander of the UDR at the time of the Miami Showband killings, when several soldiers of the regiment were involved in the killing of musicians outside the town of Banbridge. He returned to the UDR in 1977 as Colonel Commandant of the regiment until 1986.

It is also the final album with drummer David Kinkade, who joined Soulfly after recording sessions were completed and subsequently retired from music.http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/soulfly-drummer-david-kinkade-to-play- his-final-show-in-bangkok Background Borknagar‚Äôs founder, √òystein G. Brun, described the artwork for Urd as \\"an earthly expression...You can almost smell and feel the texture of the old Norse wooden carvings\\". Given that Borknagar's previous album was titled Universal, Brun suggested that it was natural for the band to \\"head back home to earth\\" when choosing the title for its next album. For Brun, this choice reflected a desire to \\"get back to the core of the band\\", and specifically \\"admiration and pondering about nature and mankind‚Äôs place therein\\". For Brun, the meaning behind the album title connects with the sound of the album: \\"Even though the album has a very progressive approach, the spirit of the album is very retrospective. Might sound a bit like a paradox, but in my opinion this 'duality' is the very core of progression. Progression without a musical anchor is plain drifting. But [there] is more to the title, different layers of philosophical ideas and perspectives.\\" Among the different layers of the album title is its connection to Norse mythology. Urd, which is the name of a norn that represents the past when deciding the fates of persons. This entity is taken by Brun as a metaphor for a modern scientific discovery. Brun speculated that Urd \\"is an ancient expression of what we today know as DNA. And I have always been very fascinated by the fact that parts and bits of our DNA actually derive from the very beginning of time. All living creatures are somewhat connected to the very first organic cell. That is some of the story behind the album title\\". Elaborating upon the interconnectedness of organisms through time, Brun has alluded to the deep ecology of Arne N√¶ss as an inspiration on Urd. \\"I just love how he [Naess] talks about nature, almost like in a childish but yet a very profound way. He professes the idea that every creature is connected and equally independent for survival. Some sort of revolt against the Christian dogma that mankind is the ruler of the earth. So based on this, I was inspired to turn my head down to earth to ponder about the 'roots' of mankind\\".

Founded in the third millenniumBC, Marat (, ) was the northernmost important city of ancient Phoenicia and a rival of nearby Arwad. During the 2ndcenturyBC, Amrit was defeated and its site largely abandoned, leaving its ruins well preserved and without extensive remodeling by later generations.  History  The city lies on the Mediterranean coast around south of modern-day Tartus. Two rivers cross the city: Nahr Amrit, near the main temple, and Nahr al-Kuble near the secondary temple, a fact that might be linked to the importance of water in the religious traditions in Amrit. The city was probably founded by the Arvadites, and served as their continental base. It grew to be one of the wealthiest towns in the dominion of Arwad. The city surrendered, along with Arwad, to Alexander the Great in 333 BC. During Seleucid times the town, known as Marathus, was probably larger and more prosperous than Arwad. In 219 BC Amrit gained independence from Arwad, and was later sacked by forces from the latter city in 148 BC.  Excavation  Excavations of the site principally began in 1860 by Ernest Renan. Excavations were again carried out in 1954 by French archaeologist Maurice Dunand. Ceramic ware finds at Amrit indicated the site had been inhabited as early as the third millennium BC. Middle and Late Bronze Age \\"silo tombs\\" were also excavated, with contents ranging from weapons to original human remains. Excavations at the necropolis south of the town yielded several tomb structures. The funeral art found in some tombs with pyramidal-or cube-shaped towers, is considered some of \\"the most notable grave-monuments of the Phoenician world.\\" Excavations also uncovered the town's ancient harbor, and a U-shaped stadium that dates back to the 4th and 3rd centuries BC and measures around in length. = Temples = One of the most important excavations at Amrit was the Phoenician temple, commonly referred to the \\"ma'abed,\\" dedicated to the god Melqart of Tyre and Eshmun. The colonnaded temple, excavated between 1955 and 1957, consists of a large court cut out of rock measuring and over deep, surrounded by a covered portico. In the center of the court a well- preserved cube-shaped cella stands. The open-air courtyard was filled with the waters of a local, traditionally sacred spring, a unique feature of this site. The temple‚Äîwhich was dated to the late 4th century BC, a period following the Persian expansion into Syria‚Äîshows major Achaemenid influence in its layout and decoration. According to Dutch archaeologist, Peter Akkermans, the temple is the \\"best-preserved monumental structure from the Phoenician homeland.\\" A second temple, described by visitors to the site in 1743 and 1860 and thought to have disappeared, was later discovered by the Syrian archaeological mission near the Nahr al-Kuble spring. = Stadium = The Pre-Olympic Phoenician Stadium north of Amrit About northeast of the main temples of ancient Marathos and north of the Amrit Tell are the remains of a rock-carved Phoenician stadium. It is separated from the other two archaeological sites by the Nahr al-Amrit and a site called by the locals al-Meqla '(the quarry').Ernst Honigmann: Marathos (2). In: Wilhelm Kroll (Publisher): Paulys Realencyclop√§die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft. 14.2, Metzler, Stuttgart, S. 1434, p. 65, 1930. The Stadium of Amrit was first described in 1745 by Richard Pococke in Part 2 of his book, A Description of the East, and Some Other Countries, as the site where an ancient Circus was held. Ernest Renan examined it in 1860 and discussed it in his book Mission de Ph√©nicie, making the conclusion that the complex was not Roman in its entirety and that the stadium was undoubtedly Phoenician. The stadium is about 225 to 230 meters long and 30 to 40 meters wide, it has similar dimensions to the stadium of Olympia in Greece (213 √ó 31/32 meters). Seven rows of seats have been partially preserved. The stadium was open to the west and had two entrances on the east side between seats. In addition, there was a tunnel to the interior. The stadium is located approximately at a right angle to the main temple of Amrit, the Maabed. The temples to the north and west have open sides or which the stadium forms a common intersection. It is believed that the Amrit stadium was the location for sacred competitions where anointing and funeral games took place. Labib Boutros, former director of athletics at the American University of Beirut has conducted recent studies of the stadium and suggested that its construction may date back as far as 1500 BC, saying that the Amrit stadium was \\"devoted to sports in Phoenicia several centuries before the Olympic Games\\".Dr. Boutros Labib., \\"The Phoenician stadium of Amrit\\", The Olympic Review, No. 112, February 1977 = Necropolis = Burial towers at Amrit called \\"al Maghazil\\" or The Spindles The Necropolis in the south of Amrit consists of underground burial chambers and two distinguishing burial towers called by the locals \\"al Maghazil\\" or The Spindles that stand up to high. The larger tower is composed of a square stone base with a slightly upward tapering cylindrical block with a base diameter of , rising to a pyramid as a top termination, which is badly damaged. The second is approximately 12 meters southeast and is not quite tall. At its base are three cylindrical parts whose diameters decrease and terminate in a dome. At the lower cylinder, to the corners of the square base plates, four lions decorate the building, which may not have been completed. Excavations of the burial chambers east of the towers has uncovered finds dated back as far as the 5th century BC.Michael Sommer: Die Ph√∂nizier. Geschichte und Kultur (= Beck‚Äôsche Reihe. Nr. 2444). C. H. Beck, M√ºnchen 2008, , II. Die Levante, p. 23. Plain limestone and clay sarcophagus were found arranged in cassette-like formation within the chambers. Other tombs are located south of the Nahr al- Qubli, the \\"al-Bur«ß BazzƒÅq\\" or Worm tower, a phenomenal structure that was originally 19.50 meters high and the Hypogeum \\"·∏§a«ßar al-·∏§ublƒÅ\\" with three burial chambers, which were still used in Roman times.Astrid Nunn: Der fig√ºrliche Motivschatz Ph√∂niziens, Syriens und Transjordanienes vom 6. bis zum 4.

Conservation  Amrit was included on the 2004 and 2006 World Monuments Fund watch lists of endangered archaeological sites. The Fund called attention to the site's rapid deterioration due to vandalism and encroaching development. In 2006 a three-day workshop was organized with participation from the UNESCO, Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums of Syria and local administrators responsible for the sites of Amrit, Tartus and Arwad.

On 6‚Äì7 April, 10 DC-3s of Pan American Airways begin hauling 30,000 gallons of fuel and 500 gallons of lubricants from Dum Dum Airport, Calcutta to Asansol for operations. This fuel, subsequently transferred via Dinjan Airfield, India to China, was for use by Lieutenant Colonel James H Doolittle's raiders when they landed in Chuchow, about 100 miles southwest of Shanghai, China after their attack on Japan. Doolittle Raiders never made Chuchow due to fuel shortages, aircraft subsequently lost. In 1943, airfield turned over to USAAF.

History In 1926 Hubert Stump founded Stump Printing, Inc. (the original name of the company) in South Whitley, Indiana, a small town located just outside Fort Wayne, Indiana. The original Stumps was started primarily as a local newspaper publisher and commercial printer. Local legend has it that in the depths of the Depression, Hubert Stump was left with one nickel that he could use to either buy a loaf of bread with or put in the church collection plate. Hubert decided to put the nickel in the collection plate. The very next day, he came up with the concept of the \\"Memorie\\" booklet, which was a printed favor for High School Proms and Junior-Senior receptions. The \\"Memorie\\" booklet turned out to be a great success.StumpsParty.com About Stumps - Our History Over the next decade, Stumps continued to expand and began to print products for schools like menus, award certificates, lunch tickets, and athletic schedules. During the 1940s, Stumps expanded their product line to include crepe streamers, balloons, and even the very first large-area theme decorating kit called \\"Evening in Paris\\". In the 1960s, it introduced the first full-color catalog that featured a large selection of themed decorating kits. In 1962, Stumps moved to a new manufacturing and distribution facility located in South Whitley, Indiana. Stumps grew rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s. Stumps not only created the first personalized favors offered to high- school students, but added a new special occasion catalog offering theme party concepts. In 1990, Shep and Wendy Moyle purchased Stumps. In 1996, Stumps pioneered the first website devoted entirely to the Prom and party market. Wendy Moyle & Shep Moyle moved back to the Fort Wayne area and took over operations of the company. These two met while working for Frito Lay in Dallas and Shep was responsible for the successful launch of Restaurant Style Tostitos chip before moving back to Fort Wayne. In January 1999, Stumps unveiled the world‚Äôs first on-line party superstore, Shindigz. This complete on-line catalog offered web shopping. Shindigz, Spiritline, and Stumps party are all offshoots of the original Stumps Printing company and are all part of the Shindigz family of brands.

Winners demonstrated innovation in cataloging, measurable company growth, and advancement to the catalog industry as a whole. According to Donna Loyle, editor of Catalog Success, the Business-to-Business Catalogers of the Year award was given to the Moyles because of their impressive business acumen. Since their purchase of Stumps in 1990, the Moyles have taken the company from a one-catalog company with 40 employees to a firm with three websites and over 225 employees.

The action began with six teams, like the previous season. But the Milwaukee Chicks and the Minneapolis Millerettes franchises were renamed the Grand Rapids Chicks and Fort Wayne Daisies respectively. The measure took effect for poor attendances in the cities of these teams the year before. At this point, the new clubs joined the Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox, all founding members of the league. The six teams competed through a 110 game schedule, while the split season was dropped in favor of a longer playoff format with the Shaugnessy format: the one seed facing the three seed and the two seed against the four seed. In addition, the pitching distance increased from 40 to 42 feet during the midseason.AAGPBL Rules of Play Nevertheless, the pitchers continued to dominate the league as an all-time record eight no-hitters were recorded in the season. Rockford's Carolyn Morris hurled a perfect game against Fort Wayne, while South Bend's Betty Luna threw four shutouts in a stretch, including her first career no-hitter. Grand Rapids' Connie Wisniewski led all pitchers with her 32 victories and a 0.81 earned run average, rivalizing with Fort Wayne's Dorothy Wiltse who recorded 29 wins and a 0.83 ERA. But the other side, Mary Nesbitt of Racine was the only hitter to top the .300 mark (.319) while Fort Wayne teammates Helen Callaghan and Faye Dancer tied for the home run title with three a piece. Wisniewski was honored with the AAGPBL Player of the Year Award.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000.

Rockford and Fort Wayne ended up facing each other in the finals, with Rockford becoming the first team to win both the season title and the championship in league history. Morris, who went 28-12 with a 1.08 ERA in the season, defeated the Chicks three times in the first round and repeated her feat against the Daisies in the finals, proving that good pitching is most important that hitting during a short series.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary ‚Äì W.

In early 2011, following the self-immolation of young Tunisian merchant Mohamed Bouazizi, a series of pro-democratic uprisings swept the Middle East, later to be known as the \\"Arab Spring\\". Bahraini activists joined the movement with a series of protests beginning on 14 February, which escalated into the Bahraini uprising. In March, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa declared martial law and a three-month state of emergency. Following the arrests of some protesters, al- Tajer coordinated a team of 25 defense lawyers to help those activists in incommunicado detention. Al-Tajer's wife Huda al-Juffairi, a medical doctor, was also active in providing medical aid to injured protesters. Al-Tajer was arrested without a warrant on 16 April 2011 at his home in Manama by more than 20 masked security officers, in front of his wife and children. The officers also confiscated laptops, mobile phones, and documents, and demanded the keys to al-Tajer's law office, forcing him to turn them over. His bank account was also frozen. On June 12, 2011, he was brought before a military tribunal; his attorneys were given no notice and were therefore not present. He was charged with inciting hatred for the regime, engaging in illegal protests, and inciting people to harm police, and pleaded not guilty. On 7 August 2011, al- Tajer was released from prison, though the charges against him appeared not to have been dropped. As one of the conditions of his release, he signed papers agreeing that he would not participate in \\"any activity against the country\\". He stated that he had been abused while in captivity by being beaten and deprived of sleep. Al-Tajer's arrest led to international outcry, with statements of protest from Human Rights Watch, the International Federation for Human Rights, Front Line Defenders, the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, and the New York City Bar Association. Amnesty International also called for the dismissal of charges against him, designating him a prisoner of conscience during his detention.

Lyons and Co., Greenford was a major food production factory located in Greenford, west London. Developed post World War I by J. Lyons and Co., covering at its height, it produced tea, coffee, grocery products and Lyons Maid ice cream. It was also where Ready Brek instant porridge breakfast cereal was developed. After the merger of Lyons with Allied Bakeries in the 1980s, and the focus of the new Allied Domecq business to focus on spirits, with the sell off of the businesses associated with the factory, the need for the facility dwindled. Redeveloped from 1998, today it is known as Lyon Way Industrial Estate. Background In 1899, the fledgling J. Lyons company had purchased property near Cadby Hall at No. 62 Hammersmith Road. They subsequently bought Cadby Hall complex itself and retained the name, although the official address of the Cadby Hall complex became 66 Hammersmith Road. In time it became one of the largest food factories in the United Kingdom, growing to cover an area of more than . However, developing a site in a fast expanding inner city meant compromise, together with large amounts of food- related diversification, resulted in stunted growth for the company in its fast growing cakes business due to the space limitations at Cadby Hall. Post World War I, the company wished to expand its cakes business on site, but concluded that to do so it needed to find a secondary site close by that would allow sufficient capacity to both house the tea and coffee business, as well as allow for potential expansion of cake production. Transport A modern view of the Grand Union Canal through Greenford, with the former J.Lyons & Co. factory in the background (demolished 2018) Transport was essential for a now international foods business, both for shipping goods in and distributing product outwards. Post the war, industry had been developing along the Grand Union Canal, north-westward from Brentford Dock to the then village of Greenford Green in Middlesex. The authorities had noticed this development, and had chosen to start development of the Western Avenue and the A4 Great West Road, both of which improved communications of the village to Central London. In 1919, Lyons bought a site which straddled the Grand Union Canal, connecting it directly to the tea warehouses of London Docks and the River Thames. Further, they signed a development and shipping agreement with the Great Western Railway. Accessed via the Greenford Branch Line, which had access to the Great Western Main Line directly via West Ealing or over the New North Main Line via Old Oak Common junction, The New North Main Line also gave access to Birmingham and the Midlands via the Chiltern Main Line, or the West Coast Main Line via Willesden Junction. Finally, the London Underground system was being pushed westwards, and had reached Acton by 1923. Production The factory officially opened in July 1921, with the first single-storey buildings known as \\"Zig-Zag\\" due to their northern light aligned windows allowing maximum light into the production area. There were steam and electrical power plants on site, which powered both the plant as well as the staff canteen and medical facilities, accessible to all plant employees and their dependents. Transport docks and a canal basin had been developed, allowing shipment of tea and coffee directly from the London Docks into HM Customs excise controlled bonded warehouses. The extensive onsite railway infrastructure allowed precise positioning of heavy raw goods into the factory, as well as the extraction of finished product. Lyons bought their own steam shunters to move wagons between the GWR exchange sidings and the factory system. Lyons, a later pioneer in electronic machines and computing, deployed the latest factory automation technology, making Greenford a showplace that was regularly visited by the media, academics, competitors and royalty, with more than one visit by King George V and Queen Mary. Areas of the site not initially developed for factory use were landscaped, with many trees planted. As the factory developed these diminished, particularly after the development of the Bridge Park factory in the 1950s, and the new administration block in 1971. =Tea= Tea was shipped directly from London docks to the bonded warehouses, where quality was checked by an onsite laboratory. Blending then took place in a dedicated and decorated blending hall. This enabled Lyons by the end of 1921 to match tea sales of the pre-War period, assisted by the acquisition of Horniman's Tea in 1918 which could now be fully integrated. By the late 1920s the Greenford factory handled over of tea per week, distributing to over 200,000 outlets throughout the country by road and rail. The tea production facilities were developed post World War 2, with the introduction of tea bags. As loose leaf tea became less popular, the balance of production facilities changed to reflect changed consumer buying patterns. To cope with this expansion, and increasing profits from the now wholly owned subsidiary tea division, in 1968 a new tea warehouse and distribution centre was built on residual land adjoining the Bridge Park ice cream factory. On hygiene production grounds, there were no connecting passages between the two facilities, except via the main entrances on Oldfield Lane North. =Coffee= Incoming infrastructure for coffee was similar to that designed and used for tea production, but separated to avoid cross- contamination. There was a separate coffee blending hall, and an additional liquid facility was constructed. The production lines eventually gained a freeze drying line to produce instant coffee products. =Lyons Maid ice cream= Lyons had purchased a site north of the Grand Union to its existing facility for expansion in the 1930s, but had not used it pre-World War II. During the war, while parts of the factory were turned over to war time production, the land to the north was used for battery hen egg production. In 1954, development of a new ice cream factory was completed, known as the Bridge Park factory. This meant that regular milk trains now entered the factory transport network. Sold under the Lyons Maid brand, the factory was continually expanded as the company battled Unilever's Wall's Ice Cream brand. =Grocery lines= Greenford also produced all of Lyons grocery lines, including: tomato sauce; salad cream; jellies; custard powder and mixes. Lyons chocolate was produced at the site, but only as an over-flow facility from Cadby Hall. Many grocery lines were phased out during and post World War 2, but new lines were also continually introduced. This included Ready Brek, created from experimentation by Walter Pitts, factory manager from the Tea division. Launched in 1957 as an instant porridge, and then in 1969 as an instant hot cereal. The brand was purchased by Weetabix in June 1990. Redevelopment: Lyon Way Industrial Estate Silos on the Lyon Way industrial estate From the 1960s, the business was losing money, but still controlled by the founding Salmon family. Lyons began to consolidate, selling and eventually closing down its tea shops, and selling its stake in the jointly owned LEO computer business with English Electric. In 1978, Lyons was acquired by Allied Breweries and became part of the resulting Allied Lyons. The new business decided to focus on the production of alcohol and spirits, renaming itself Allied Domecq, and so began to dispose of the now non-core food production brands and facilities. Greenford being an integrated food production facility was an obvious casualty of the asset sell-off. In 1992, the Lyons Maid business was sold to Nestl√©, and the cakes business to Rank Hovis McDougall, integrated to their Manor Bakeries subsidiary which also makes Mr Kipling's Cakes. In 1995 the tea business was sold in a venture capital-backed Management buyout, under the terms of which the Greenford site was to be vacated. In 1997, Allied Domecq arranged the phased disposal of the Greenford site from 1998. By 2002 the project was completed, and the site renamed Lyon Way Industrial Estate.

(anglicised as Cormack Magauran or McGovern), b. c.1442-d.1511, was the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kilmore diocese, Ireland from 1476 to 1480 and the anti-bishop of Kilmore from 1480 to 1511. Genealogy and birth Cormac M√°g Shamhradh√°in was a member of the McGovern clan who were the rulers in the Middle Ages of the tuath of Teallach n-Eachach in Breifne (now Tullyhaw, County Cavan, Ireland). He was born c.1442, probably in or near Drumlane Abbey, County Cavan, where his father Cormac M√°c Shamhradh√°in O.S.A. was the Prior of Drumlane and who later in 1444 was appointed Bishop of Ardagh.D√°n do Chormac M√°g Shamhradh√°in Easpag Ardachaidh by Gear√≥id Mac Niocaill in Seanchas Ardmhacha, vol. 4, no. 1 (1960-61), pp. 141-146. As the son of a priest Cormac was therefore illegitimate at birth. Under Canon Law this was a bar to receiving Church appointments and caused him trouble in later life. Cormac was descended from the chief who ruled Tullyhaw from 1258‚Äì1272, Donnchadh 'Cime' M√°g Samhradh√°in. His pedigree is Cormac mac Cormac mac Piaras mac Aindriu mac Cleiminnt mac Tom√°s Amhlaoibh mac Mac Craithe mac Donnchadh 'Cime' M√°g Samhradh√°in. Priesthood and Drumlane Abbey Cormac was presumably educated at Drumlane Abbey which was founded about the 6th century AD by Saint Columba. The abbey was a chapter house of the Augustinian Abbey of Kells, Co. Meath and it was dedicated to Saint Mary. Cormac was subsequently ordained a priest and on 13 October 1461 he was appointed vicar of Templeport parish, County Cavan, in succession to Rory McGovern who had been excommunicated.Calendar of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and Ireland. Papal Letters, ed. J.A. Twemlow (London 1933), vol. XII, pp. 141-142.De Annatis Hiberniae, ed. M.A. Costello 1909, vol I, pp. 236-237. On 26 August 1467, Cormac was transferred from Templeport to Drumlane where he succeeded John MacBrian to the post of Prior of Drumlane due to hereditary succession rights, as both his father and grandfather were previous Priors of Drumlane. He also became a member of the Augustinian Canons.Calendar of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and Ireland. Papal Letters, ed. J.A. Twemlow (London 1933), vol. XII, pp. 563-564. The McGovern clan through the ages were associated with Drumlane and in the 15th century alone at least five of its members were appointed Prior thereof. The ecclesiastical offices in Drumlane (Abbott, Prior, Parish Priest) were generally split between the McGoverns who were the hereditary erenachs and the O‚ÄôFarrellys who were the hereditary coarbs of Drumlane. Cormac retained the office of Prior until his death in 1511. Bishop of Kilmore On the death of Seo√°n √ì Raghillaigh II, the Bishop of Kilmore, in 1476, Cormac M√°c Shamhradh√°in was appointed as the new bishop on 4 November 1476 by Pope Sixtus IV.Calendar of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and Ireland. Papal Letters, ed. J.A. Twemlow (London 1955), vol. XIII, Part 1, p. 154.On the same date the Pope gave him a dispensation for his illegitimacy.Calendar of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and Ireland. Papal Letters, ed. J.A. Twemlow (London 1955), vol. XIII, Part 1, p. 277. Due to the small revenues of the diocese, Cormac was also allowed to retain his office of Prior of Drumlane. On 6 November 1476 Cormac was licensed to be consecrated as bishop by whichever bishops he chose.Calendar of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and Ireland. Papal Letters, ed. J.A. Twemlow (London 1955), vol. XIII, Part 1, p. 154. However immediate objections were raised to his appointment (perhaps because of the fact that he was illegitimate), which resulted in a schism which would disrupt the Diocese of Kilmore for the next 35 years. When the Archbishop of Armagh Ottaviano Spinelli de Palatio held his first Provincial Council at Drogheda in July 1480, neither Cormac nor his rival and successor Tom√°s Mac Br√°daigh was present at the council.The Register of Octavian de Palatio, Archbishop of Armagh 1478-1513 f. 385 As a result of the objections, Cormac's appointment as Bishop of Kilmore was revoked on 20 October 1480 and Tom√°s Mac Br√°daigh, the Archdeacon of Kilmore, was appointed as the new bishop by Pope Sixtus IV. The Pope of course had already given Cormac dispensation for his illegitimacy when appointed bishop so the decision may best be viewed as a political struggle between the Lords of West Kilmore, the O‚ÄôRourkes, who backed the candidacy of their client sept of the McGoverns against the Lords of East Kilmore, the O‚ÄôReillys, who backed their client sept of the Bradys for the bishopric. Cormac however did not accept the decision and appealed the matter on several occasions and still asserted himself as Bishop of Kilmore at his death in December 1511. On 25 November 1482 Primate Octavian arranged a meeting between the two rivals at Inismor in Lough Gowna in order to come to a settlement.The Register of Octavian de Palatio, Archbishop of Armagh 1478-1513 f. 276 At the meeting, in return for certain payments from Tom√°s Mac Br√°daigh, Cormac undertook to renounce all his emoluments from the two rural deaneries of Drumlane and Rossinver Dartry and also to refrain from seeking any further apostolic letters against the new bishop and to abide by the pledges given on his behalf by any nobles or poets. In the document Cormac is referred to as Prior of Drumlane. On 21 November 1483 the Consistorial Archives refer to Cormac as Electus Kilmorensis which probably meant Cormac was regarded as the Deputy Bishop of Kilmore with some rights, perhaps being in charge of the Breifne O‚ÄôRourke part of the Diocese from Drumlane westwards.De Annatis Hiberniae, ed. M.A. Costello 1909, vol I, p. 258. The confusion about who was bishop was still ongoing in 1487 where the preface to the Thebaid of Statius stated- \\"This book was written a.d. 1487‚Ä¶ and at the same period there were two bishops in the bishopric of Kilmore, to wit, Cormac, son of the bishop Magauran, and Thomas son of Andrew MacBrady, each one of them alleging that he himself is bishop there.\\"Togail na Tebe: The Thebaid of Statius:, ed. George Calder (Cambridge: University Press 1922), p. xxiii. An attempt to resolve the impasse was made at the Provincial Council of Armagh held in 1489 at St. Mary's Church, Ardee, County Louth under the presidency of Dr. John Payne, Bishop of Meath. The Council appointed said Dr. Payne together with Bishop Uilliam √ì Fearghail of Ardagh to look into the matter.The Register of Octavian de Palatio, Archbishop of Armagh 1478-1513 f. 386v. These two bishops met and co-opted the new bishop of Clogher John Edmund de Courcy as a third arbitrator. Their decision was that they \\"adjudged the rule, administration and property of said church to said Thomas, and the proceedings regarding them of said Cormac they declared to be rash, unlawful and de facto presumptuous, and imposed on Cormac perpetual silence, which sentence not having been appealed against, in rem transivit indicatam\\".De Annatis Hiberniae, ed. M.A. Costello 1909, vol I, p. 258. However that Cormac refused to take this decision lying down is evident from his attendance at the Provincial Synod of 1492 and the attendance at the Synod of Drogheda on 6 July 1495 of both Cormac and Thomas where they were styled as- \\"Thomas et Cormac gratia divina Kilmorensis Episcopi\\" (Tom√°s and Cormac, by the grace of God, Bishops of Kilmore).Hibernia Dominicana, p. 86. andThe Register of Octavian de Palatio, Archbishop of Armagh 1478-1513 ff. 397a and 404 No records of attendance survive for the subsequent Provincial Councils of 1498 and 1501. At those of 1504 and 1507, Cormac was absent but Tom√°s Mac Br√°daigh was present.The Register of Octavian de Palatio, Archbishop of Armagh 1478-1513 ff. 414 and 287 After disputing the See of Kilmore for 35 years, it was perhaps fitting that both bishops died within four months of each other. Bishop Tom√°s Mac Br√°daigh died at Dromahaire, County Leitrim on Tuesday 29 July 1511 and was buried in Cavan Monastery on the following Friday 1 August 1511, with presumably Cormac in attendance.The Annals of Kingdom of Ireland, J. O‚ÄôDonovan, Ed. (1851), p. 1309, Year 1511 AD. Diarmaid √ì Raghillaigh was then appointed as successor to Tom√°s Mac Br√°daigh as the Bishop of Kilmore by Pope Julius II. However Cormac M√°g Shamhradh√°in was still claiming the bishopric so an appeal was made by the new Bishop Diarmaid to Pope Julius II to implement the decision of the 1489 Ardee Synod. Before the Pope made his decision, Cormac died in December 1211 but as news to Rome travelled slowly in those days and the Vatican bureaucracy even slower, the word of his death had not reached the Pope by 3 June 1512 when Julius II issued a Bull which- \\"commanded the Bishop of Meath, and the Dean and Archdeacon of Kilmore, or any two or one of them, Cormac and any others evocandis being cited, if it should be evident to them then that in the matter adjudicated upon the sentence has been rightly given, to cause it by apostolic authority, appellatione postposita, to be firmly observed.\\"De Annatis Hiberniae, ed. M.A. Costello 1909, vol I, p. 258. Death Cormac died in December 1511. The Annals of Ireland for that year state- \\"Cormac Magauran, who was called Bishop in Breifny, died before Christmas\\".The Annals of Kingdom of Ireland, J. O‚ÄôDonovan, Ed. (1851), p. 1309, Year 1511 AD Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh states- \\"Thomas, son of Andrew Mac Brady, bishop and herenech of the two Breifnes during 30 years, quievit 1511. Cormac Mac Samhradhain, styled bishop in the Breifne, quievit 1511.\\"Of certain bishops of Erinn who are not now reckoned as having filled Bishop‚Äôs Sees, by Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh, tr. D.H. Kelly (Dublin 1869), p.13 He was probably buried at Drumlane. Descendants Cormac left at least one son, Fergal M√°g Shamhradh√°in, who continued the family traditions of priesthood and illegitimacy. Fergal was appointed vicar of Templeport parish on 22 February 1503.Calendar of Papal Registers Relating to Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 17: (1955), pp. 574-5. Fergal had at least two sons. Firstly Cormac, who was named in honour of both Fergal's father and grandfather. This Cormack had a son Edmund who lived in Kilnavert townland which was the location of the R.C. Church in Templeport. Fergal's other son was Pearse who he named in honour of his great-grandfather. This Pearse lived in Lisduff townland. Both of Fergal's grandsons received pardons in the Fiants of Elizabeth I dated 19 January 1586, No. 4813- \\"Pardon to Edm. m'Cormuck m‚ÄôFerrall Magawran of Kilfert and Philip m'Peirce m‚ÄôFerrall Magawran of Lysdoufe\\". The parish priest of Templeport in 1576 was Fergal McGovern and it is likely he was also a grandson of Fergal M√°g Shamhradh√°in, thus continuing the priestly line of succession.

He was the only accredited black foreign correspondent specifically reporting on African-American servicemen stationed in France during World War I. His career began in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, in the late 1880s, where he held several journalistic positions including editor of the Afro-American; co-founding the short-lived African-American newspaper, The Free American; contributing a Black news column and serving as society editor at the white-owned Columbus Evening Dispatch, and writing for The Ohio State Journal.Lorenz, Alfred Lawrence. 2005. \\"Ralph W. Tyler: The Unknown Correspondent of World War I,\\" Journalism History 31:1 Spring : 3‚Äì12. Early on, his journalistic skills placed him in constant dialog with black political and business leaders in the Midwest who were engaged in improving the social standing of African Americans at the height of the Jim Crow laws.George A. Myer's Papers, 1890‚Äì1929. Processed 1999. Papers. Archives/Library: Ohio Historical Society In 1906, Tyler actively campaigned for an appointment as United States consul to Brazil. His political activities drew the attention of prominent national Black figures. In 1907, upon the advice of Booker T. Washington, Tyler was appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt to fill the post of Auditor of the Department of the Navy. He held this post until 1913, when during the first year of Woodrow Wilson's presidency‚Äîoverlooking the advice of his colleagues‚ÄîTyler published an article in the Washington Evening Star criticizing the President's segregationist policies, such as the segregation of government offices. Soon afterward, Tyler's governmental post under Wilson ended. Booker T. Washington and his Secretary, Emmett J. Scott, next recommended Tyler to be the National Organizer of the National Negro Business League (NNBL), an organization founded by Washington to engage in documenting the state of black businesses to promote an organized and active League membership.National Negro Business League. 1913‚Äì1914. Papers. The Schomburg Center for Black Culture Tyler learned about the social conditions and concerns of blacks throughout the country. His role at the NNBL entailed visiting and addressing local branches of the NNBL. His findings were reported in a 1914 syndicated column of the American Press Association, and his travels through the Southern U.S. enabled him to undertake a personal study of the Great Migration then in progress by blacks out of the rural South for the North and Midwest. These reports were eventually published in various U.S. magazines, journals, and newspapers. In 1917, Tyler left this post to serve as secretary in another organization founded by Washington, the National Colored Soldiers' Comfort Committee, which provided financial support for black soldiers and their families. Following this position, Tyler was selected as the only African-American journalist to be stationed overseas during World War I to report on black soldiers at the front. Although approximately 30,000 black combat troops and 160,000 Army laborers were stationed in the 92 and 93rd divisions in France, the mainstream press largely overlooked their contributions. Thus, in 1918 a committee of black journalists and civic leaders overseen by Emmett J. Scott, (aka, Emmett Jay Scott) was formed to address the problem and Tyler was selected to report on the black troops serving in the War. At the time, Scott was employed by the U.S. as the Special Assistant for Race Relations to the Secretary of War, Newton Baker. Concurrently, there was also a growing concern among U.S. government officials that blacks, who were experiencing ongoing racism in the civilian population as well as overseas in France, would be swayed by German propaganda to turn against the U.S. war efforts. Scott was able to convince Baker to send Tyler to report on the developments of Black soldiers with the stipulation that Tyler's reports would be screened by Baker and the Committee on Public Information (CPI) then by Scott before they were circulated in the U.S. press. Tyler later said that he accepted the position without salary and he would only be paid his expenses so that he would be able to speak freely on what he witnessed once he returned home. He was stationed in the northeast Metz region of France with the all Black soldiered 92nd division of General John J. Pershing's brigade. Reporting from the trenches at the front in Northeastern Metz, France, Tyler's reports were screened by the U.S. Committee on Public Information, sent back to the U.S., and edited and distributed by Scott to newspapers and journals nationally. Later Scott published several of Tyler's reports in Scott's Official History of the American Negro in The World War (1919). Back in the States, Tyler's reports provided first-hand accounts of the heroic deeds of black soldiers and boosted the morale of the troops overseas. He also documented discrimination that the black troops faced at the hands of white American organizations and service personnel, and contrasted it with the relatively unbiased treatment they received from the French. Following the war, Tyler returned to Ohio where he worked in journalism, becoming editor of the Cleveland Advocate in 1919, associate editor of the Columbus Ohio State Monitor, and contributing articles to newspapers in New York and Chicago. Numerous letters of Tyler's personal correspondence can be found at the Ohio Historical Society. The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture holds Tyler's business letters and reports from his post as National Director of the National Negro Business League.

The series jokes about female conversation. Twitter The Twitter account @shitgirlssay was launched in April 2011, and promoted by Sheppard through his film and music industry contacts. As of August 2012, they had 1.6 million Twitter followers. Videos At one point, Toronto International Film Festival artistic director Cameron Bailey tweeted that he hoped the Twitter feed would be made into a movie. By that point, Juliette Lewis had already filmed an appearance in the first video. The original video, as of September 2012, had 30 million views. The boyfriend in some videos is played by Humphrey. Becoming an Internet meme, the series itself has been parodied on YouTube as a snowclone for other demographics, both for humorous effect and non-humorous, political effect. Some materials suggest that at least 700 imitation videos were created, while other reports suggest over 1000. Among them are \\"S--- Liz Lemon Says\\", the favourite imitator of the creators. The fourth video debuted at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, in a Maverick session hosted by George Stromboulopoulos. Other sessions in the series talked with Johnny Depp and Javier Bardem. Videos scripts are written as a team, and Sheppard directs. Sheppard auditioned for the role of Betsy Putch in The Mindy Project, admittedly bombing, a role given to Zoe Jarman.

Early life Born in Hamilton, Ontario in 1936, when he was seven years old in 1944, \\"his parents went out for a night of dinner and dancing at the local Moose Hall. The festivities took place in a second-floor room that became a death trap when an arsonist set fire to the only stairwell. His father wrapped his mother in drapes to protect her and was opening a window that provided access to a nearby tree when the panicked crowd rushed at him and accidentally pushed him out the window and into the tree. The next day, his father sent him and older sister Eileen to an aunt's farm for a week. On the car ride back, he unceremoniously presented them with an article rehashing the gruesome details of that night and conveying the news of their mother's death.\\" Aged 16, Martin lied about his age and joined the Navy. \\"I was a big kid for my age ... [then] they found out how old I really was and kicked me out\\". He had been dating his future wife already and they were married July 21, 1956, when Martin was 19 years old. The union produced two daughters. He took a job at Westinghouse in Hamilton, and a chance to play with the Hamilton Tigers football club came up. Needing to get in better shape, and rehab his knee, a friend directed Martin to a gym run by Al Spittles. The gym happened to be where local wrestlers trained and Pepper soon fell in with them, learning the sport. Professional wrestling career Martin debuted in 1957. In his first match, he teamed with Bolus against Johnny Evans (later Reggie Love) and Bull Johnson (father of \\"Bullwhip\\" Danny Johnson). Martin would live out of Windsor as he traveled the Detroit territory. He would leave for the Tennessee area and quickly return to Detroit, before going to work for Jim Barnett's Indianapolis territory, which had just opened in 1959. Even though he was still a preliminary wrestler, Pepper began making real money at this point, sometimes over $1,000 a night in the big arenas. Martin moved his family to the States to work for Leroy McGuirk's Tulsa, Oklahoma office in the 1960s and soon made good friends with his future tag partner and ring general, Al Lovelock. They worked out of New Orleans for a year; Pepper described the travel as \\"horrendous\\". They eventually made their way to Texas, where Pepper was stabbed by a fan. Returning home to Ontario to recoup, he later returned to Texas, but this time as a babyface (wrestling jargon for \\"good guy\\"). Over the next couple of years he would work in Minneapolis, Vancouver, and St. Louis before getting a phone call from Roy Shire, the promoter out of San Francisco. It was the call that would change his life by bringing him to the West Coast and his future on the silver screen. One weekend while wrestling in between San Francisco and Los Angeles, wrestler-turned-actor Woody Strode invited Pepper to Hollywood for a late night romp. They ended up waking director John Ford up at three in the morning, being ejected from his lawn and then drinking until eight o'clock with Hollywood tough guy Lee Marvin. Pepper would later befriend John Ford and even spend Sundays swimming at his house. It was also while working in Los Angeles that wrestling legend Freddie Blassie would give Martin the chance to commentate the matches with Dick Lane, something that he attributes to helping him in his future acting career. Then disaster struck Martin's life. During a 1962 match in Long Beach, Martin broke his back. The doctor discovered a small vertical crack in his spine, but denying surgery, Martin had a pallet made up that he would lie on for the next six weeks to keep his back straight and allow it to heal. Come June 1962, he was better and intending to return to Canada when Dick Beyer, who had worked as The Destroyer, suggested he go to the Pacific Northwest territory where a babyface was needed. Talking on the phone to promoter Don Owen (who was the first to ever put professional wrestling on television), Pepper decided to get outrageous with his pay, saying he'd do it for 10% of the gate. \\"I'll stay six weeks. If I get over, I'll stay. If I don't get over, that's my notice, and I want ten percent\\". Owen agreed, and what followed was the most successful run of Pepper Martin's wrestling career. In the NWA Pacific Northwest territory, Pepper became a multiple time champion, but continued in his role as commentator, calling matches in Portland, Seattle, Tacoma and Eugene. Officially, Martin was an NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Champion five times, exchanging the title with other wrestling legends Stan Stasiak, Mad Dog Vachon, Paul Jones, Tony Borne and the aforementioned Patterson. Martin also became an eight time NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Champion with Shag Thomas (4x), Luther Lindsay (2x), Paul Jones and Billy White Wolf. Acting career Martin's first feature film was the 1968 film Angels from Hell. He also appeared in Walking Tall (1973), The Longest Yard (1974), Live A Little, Steal A Lot (1975), the slasher Scream (1981) and the horror comedy Return to Horror High (1987). He may be best known for his role as the truck driver, Rocky, who beats up a depowered Superman in the 1980 sequel Superman II. Martin's TV appearances include Police Woman, The Mod Squad, I Dream of Jeannie, The Incredible Hulk, Mannix and The Rockford Files. The play The Time of Your Life was revived on March 17, 1972 at the Huntington Hartford Theater in Los Angeles with Martin, Henry Fonda, Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Thompson, Gloria Grahame, Lewis J. Stadlen, Strother Martin, Richard X. Slattery and Jane Alexander among the cast with Edwin Sherin directing.

Early life and career  Originally from Birchington-on-Sea, Kent, Aston went to Tonbridge Grammar School for Girls and was educated at University College London (BSc) and Reading University (MSc in applied meteorology). Between 2000 and 2003 Felicity Aston was the senior meteorologist at Rothera Research Station located on Adelaide Island off the Antarctic Peninsula operated by the British Antarctic Survey, monitoring climate and ozone. As was usual at the time for British Antarctic Survey staff, she spent three summers and two winters continuously at the station without leaving Antarctica.  Exploration and racing  Aston in Antarctica In 2005 she joined a race across Arctic Canada to the 1996 position of the North Magnetic Pole, known as the Polar Challenge. She was part of the first all-female team to complete this race; they came in 6th place out of 16 teams. In 2006 Aston was part of the first all-female British expedition across the Greenland ice sheet. In 2009 she was the team leader of the Kaspersky Commonwealth Antarctic Expedition, which was a Commonwealth of Nations expedition in which seven women from six Commonwealth member countries skied to the South Pole in 2009 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Commonwealth.\\"Sept femmes arrivent au P√¥le Sud apr√®s un trek de 900 km\\", Nouvel Observateur, 31 December 2009\\"Women complete 562-mile ski journey to South Pole\\", Los Angeles Times, 31 December 2009 \\"Call of the White: Taking the world to the South Pole\\" is her account of this expedition. It was published by Summersdale in 2011 and was a finalist in the Banff Mountain Book Competition in that year. In 2012 she became the first person to ski alone across the Antarctic land-mass using only personal muscle power, as well as the first woman to cross the Antarctic land-mass alone. Her journey began on 25 November 2011, at the Leverett Glacier and continued for 59 days and a distance of 1,084 miles (1,744 kilometres). She had two supply drops. Aston has also walked across the ice of Lake Baikal, the world's deepest and oldest lake, and completed the Marathon des Sables.

Tore Eriksen is chief-of-administration. Traditionally, the county administration was said to be in the village of Hermansverk, which was regarded as the administrative seat, but Hermansverk and the neighboring village of Leikanger have grown together and form one large village, and now the administrative seat is said to be Leikanger even though the buildings are still in the same place.

It links the downtown Kentron area of Yerevan with the Monument neighborhood. Designed by architects Jim Torosyan, Aslan Mkhitaryan, and Sargis Gurzadyan the construction of the cascade started in 1971 and was partially completed in 1980. Inside the Cascade, underneath the exterior steps, are seven escalators that rise along the length of the complex. There are also exhibit halls connected to some of the landings along the escalators which compose the Cafesjian Museum of Art. The exterior of The Cascade features multiple levels adorned with fountains and modernist sculptures from the Cafesjian collection. The stairs afford walkers unobstructed views of central Yerevan and Mount Ararat. At the base of the Cascade is a garden courtyard with statues by contemporary sculptors such as Botero, Lynn Chadwick, and Barry Flanagan. There are a number of cafes and restaurants on both sides of the Cascade frequented by locals and tourists. Classical and jazz concerts often take place at the Cascade during spring, summer and early autumn, with spectators sitting on the steps. History Construction began in 1971 during the Soviet era. The first phase was completed in 1980. The second phase began in earnest in 2002 and lasted until 2009. The complex was handed over to the American-Armenian magnate and collector Gerard Cafesjian in the early 2000s during which the complex underwent further renovation. A large museum complex is planned at the zenith but remains stalled and is still in the early stages of construction.

The arithmetic zeta function generalizes the Riemann zeta function and Dedekind zeta function to higher dimensions. The arithmetic zeta function is one of the most-fundamental objects of number theory. Definition The arithmetic zeta function is defined by an Euler product analogous to the Riemann zeta function: :{\\\\zeta_X(s)} = \\\\prod_{x} \\\\frac{1}{1 - N(x)^{-s}}, where the product is taken over all closed points of the scheme . Equivalently, the product is over all points whose residue field is finite. The cardinality of this field is denoted . Examples and properties =Varieties over a finite field= If is the spectrum of a finite field with elements, then :\\\\zeta_X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{1-q^{-s}}. For a variety X over a finite field, it is known by Grothendieck's trace formula that :\\\\zeta_X(s) = Z(X, q^{-s}) where Z(X, t) is a rational function (i.e., a quotient of polynomials). Given two varieties X and Y over a finite field, the zeta function of X \\\\times Y is given by :Z(X, t) \\\\star Z(Y, t)=Z(X \\\\times Y, t), where \\\\star denotes the multiplication in the ring W(\\\\mathbf Z) of Witt vectors of the integers. =Ring of integers= If is the spectrum of the ring of integers, then is the Riemann zeta function. More generally, if is the spectrum of the ring of integers of an algebraic number field, then is the Dedekind zeta function. =Zeta functions of disjoint unions= The zeta function of affine and projective spaces over a scheme are given by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\zeta_{\\\\mathbf A^n(X)}(s) &= \\\\zeta_X(s-n)  \\\\zeta_{\\\\mathbf P^n(X)}(s) &= \\\\prod_{i=0}^n \\\\zeta_X(s-i) \\\\end{align} The latter equation can be deduced from the former using that, for any that is the disjoint union of a closed and open subscheme and , respectively, :\\\\zeta_X(s) = \\\\zeta_U(s) \\\\zeta_V(s). Even more generally, a similar formula holds for infinite disjoint unions. In particular, this shows that the zeta function of is the product of the ones of the reduction of modulo the primes : :\\\\zeta_X(s) = \\\\prod_p \\\\zeta_{X_p}(s). Such an expression ranging over each prime number is sometimes called Euler product and each factor is called Euler factor. In many cases of interest, the generic fiber is smooth. Then, only finitely many are singular (bad reduction). For almost all primes, namely when has good reduction, the Euler factor is known to agree with the corresponding factor of the Hasse-Weil zeta function of . Therefore, these two functions are closely related. Main conjectures There are a number of conjectures concerning the behavior of the zeta function of a regular irreducible equidimensional scheme (of finite type over the integers). Many (but not all) of these conjectures generalize the one-dimensional case of well known theorems about the Euler- Riemann-Dedekind zeta function. The scheme need not be flat over , in this case it is a scheme of finite type over some . This is referred to as the characteristic case below. In the latter case, many of these conjectures (with the most notable exception of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, i.e. the study of special values) are known. Very little is known for schemes that are flat over and are of dimension two and higher. =Meromorphic continuation and functional equation= Hasse and Weil conjectured that has a meromorphic continuation to the complex plane and satisfies a functional equation with respect to where is the absolute dimension of . This is proven for and some very special cases when for flat schemes over and for all in positive characteristic. It is a consequence of the Weil conjectures (more precisely, the Riemann hypothesis part thereof) that the zeta function has a meromorphic continuation up to \\\\mathrm{Re}(s)>n-\\\\tfrac{1}{2}. =The generalized Riemann hypothesis= According to the generalized Riemann Hypothesis the zeros of are conjectured to lie inside the critical strip lie on the vertical lines and the poles of inside the critical strip lie on the vertical lines . This was proved (Emil Artin, Helmut Hasse, Andr√© Weil, Alexander Grothendieck, Pierre Deligne) in positive characteristic for all . It is not proved for any scheme that is flat over . The Riemann hypothesis is a partial case of Conjecture 2. =Pole orders= Subject to the analytic continuation, the order of the zero or pole and the residue of at integer points inside the critical strip is conjectured to be expressible by important arithmetic invariants of . An argument due to Serre based on the above elementary properties and Noether normalization shows that the zeta function of has a pole at whose order equals the number of irreducible components of with maximal dimension. Secondly, Tate conjectured :\\\\mathrm{ord}_{s=n-1} \\\\zeta_X(s) = rk \\\\mathcal O_X^\\\\times(X) - rk \\\\mathrm{Pic}(X) i.e., the pole order is expressible by the rank of the groups of invertible regular functions and the Picard group. The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is a partial case this conjecture. In fact, this conjecture of Tate's is equivalent to a generalization of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. More generally, Soul√© conjectured :\\\\mathrm{ord}_{s=n-m} \\\\zeta_X(s) = - \\\\sum_i (-1)^i rk K_i (X)^{(m)} The right hand side denotes the Adams eigenspaces of algebraic -theory of . These ranks are finite under the Bass conjecture. These conjectures are known when , that is, the case of number rings and curves over finite fields. As for , partial cases of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture have been proven, but even in positive characteristic the conjecture remains open. Methods and theories The arithmetic zeta function of a regular connected equidimensional arithmetic scheme of Kronecker dimension can be factorized into the product of appropriately defined -factors and an auxiliary factor. Hence, results on -functions imply corresponding results for the arithmetic zeta functions. However, there is still very little amount of proven results about the -factors of arithmetic schemes in characteristic zero and dimensions 2 and higher. Ivan Fesenko initiated a theory which studies the arithmetic zeta functions directly, without working with their -factors. It is a higher- dimensional generalisation of Tate's thesis, i.e. it uses higher adele groups, higher zeta integral and objects which come from higher class field theory. In this theory, the meromorphic continuation and functional equation of proper regular models of elliptic curves over global fields is related to mean- periodicity property of a boundary function. In his joint work with M. Suzuki and G. Ricotta a new correspondence in number theory is proposed, between the arithmetic zeta functions and mean-periodic functions in the space of smooth functions on the real line of not more than exponential growth. This correspondence is related to the Langlands correspondence. Two other applications of Fesenko's theory are to the poles of the zeta function of proper models of elliptic curves over global fields and to the special value at the central point.

While Wallachia was to receive a new Turkish sponsored ruler, Moldavia was to be simply incorporated into the Ottoman Empire as a province. The Ottoman intervention aroused alarms in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth which sought to reestablish its influence in the region, having lost sovereignty over Moldavia some hundred years earlier after the Battle of the Cosmin Forest. Battle In the summer of 1595 the crown army of the Kingdom of Poland, numbering around 5000 cavalry, 2300 infantry and a few artillery pieces, led by the Crown Hetman Jan Zamoyski entered into the territory of Principality of Moldavia and on the 27th of August took Chocim and shortly after, on September 3, the capital of the principality, Ia»ôi. Zamoyski then installed Ieremia MovilƒÉ, who was amicably disposed towards the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, as Hospodar (Prince) of Moldavia. Zamoyski's intent was to create a buffer zone of friendly states around the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth, consisting of Moldavia, Transylvania and Wallachia, in order to protect it from Ottoman Turkey. The Ottomans reacted swiftly, although at the time the Sultan Mehmed III was engaged in a war against Michael the Brave, the Prince of Wallachia. The Sultan send the Crimean Tatars, under Khan ƒûazƒ± II Girej, supported by regular Ottoman troops, altogether numbering around 25,000 soldiers, to meet the Polish army. Upon hearing that the Tatars were approaching, Zamoyski crossed the Prut river and on September 6 had his troops erect a fortified camp, which was protected on both flanks by the river. The front of the camp in turn was defended by a rampart studded with thirteen bastions. The rampart also possessed four sally ports which could be used for sorties. The Khan's army arrived on the 18th of September. That day minor fighting took place among individual skirmishers, during which Prince Kirill R√≥≈ºy≈Ñski wounded the khan's nephew with a bow. The main fighting took place the following day when the khan's troops tried to storm the Polish camp. However, because the Tatars had few infantry the attempt was unsuccessful, and the attackers were constantly harried by Polish sallies issuing from the camp. After the struggle went no better for the Tartars on the 20th, ƒûazƒ± came to the conclusion that he did not have the means to take the camp and agreed to peace talks. On October 21 a peace treaty was signed, according to which the Tatars recognized MovilƒÉ as Hospodar in Moldavia, and assented to Polish troops being permanently stationed in the Principality. Two days later the Tatar army began its withdrawal.

Niketas first appears in Irene's unique triumphal procession on Easter Monday, 1 April 799. At the time, he was already Domestic of the Schools (commander of the elite Scholai regiment) and holder of the supreme dignity of patrikios. Niketas was one of the four patrikioi (along with Bardanes Tourkos, Constantine Boilas, and Niketas' brother Sisinnios) leading the four white horses which drew the imperial carriage, a role that marks him out as one of the most prominent of Irene's supporters among the high dignitaries of the state.Guilland (1967), p. 436Treadgold (1988), p. 114Winkelmann et al. (1999), pp. 420‚Äì421 A few weeks later, in May, Irene's health worsened considerably and the issue of her succession became opened. At this point Niketas (and possibly his brother too) allied himself with the eunuch Aetios to curb the influence of Irene's powerful eunuch chief minister, Staurakios. The two went before the empress and accused him of conspiring to seize the throne. Staurakios managed to escape with a rebuke from the empress, but took steps to gather armed support to counter Aetios' and Niketas' control of the army's senior officers. The two camps remained at a stalemate thereafter until February 800, when Staurakios was forbidden to have contacts with the military and Aetios was promoted to the powerful post of strategos of the Anatolic Theme. Despite the fact that Staurakios fell ill soon after, his supporters launched a rebellion on his behalf in Cappadocia. Staurakios however died on 3 June 800, before news of this reached the capital; the revolt was swiftly suppressed.Treadgold (1988), pp. 115‚Äì117Winkelmann et al. (1999), p. 421 Despite his earlier support of Irene, Triphyllios opposed the fiscal policies adopted by the empress over the next year, as well as the rising influence of Aetios, who replaced Niketas' brother Sisinnios as strategos of Thrace with his own brother Leo. He was thus among the leaders of her overthrow by the General Logothete, Nikephoros I, on 31 October 802. He remained in his post as Domestic of the Schools until his sudden death on 30 April 803. The imperial chroniclers reporting the rumour that he was poisoned on the orders of Nikephoros, but given Nikephoros' continued close relation with Sisinnios, this is unlikely.Treadgold (1988), pp. 118‚Äì119, 129  References   Sources   Category:8th-century births Category:803 deaths Category:8th-century Byzantine people Category:9th- century Byzantine people Category:Byzantine generals Category:Patricii Category:Domestics of the Schools ","title":"Niketas Triphyllios"},{"id":"34472027","text":"The Sabre Wildcat is one of a series of American two-seat ultralight trikes that was designed by Richard Helm and produced by Sabre Aircraft.

It flanks both the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers and their confluence. The district has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1988. It is part of The City Beautiful Movement and City Planning in Des Moines, Iowa 1892‚Äî1938 MPS. Description The structures within the district were built between 1900 and 1938. with The contributing properties include six public buildings and seven structures. The six buildings include the Armory and World War Memorial Building, the former Public Library of Des Moines, the former Post Office, Municipal Building, Municipal Court Building and the U.S. Court House. The seven contributing structures include the Center Street Dam, West River Front Park, East River Front Park, the River Walls, Scott Avenue Bridge and Dam, Court Avenue Bridge and the Riverside Drive Bridge. There are also five noncontributing structures which include the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Bridge, the Des Moines Union Railway Company Bridge, the Grand Avenue Bridge, the Locust Street Bridge and the Walnut Street Bridge. The buildings in the Civic Center district were built along the river as part of the plans for riverfront development. Both the East and West Riverfront Parks are examples of the principles found in the City Beautiful Movement. The main facades of the municipal government buildings face the river itself while those of the federal government buildings face the street. Part of the planning included flood prevention from the flood-prone rivers as well as the way the Raccoon River flowed into the Des Moines River. There has been 11,617 linear feet of river walls built as part of the flood protection efforts. An intercepting sewer system to handle storm run-off is also a part of the river wall structure. Plans to construct the walls were completed in 1908. Construction of the walls, however, was not completed until 1938 as projects of the Civil Works Administration and the Works Project Administration. When the Locust Street, Walnut Street, and Grand Avenue bridges were reconstructed in the late 1960s their original ornamentation was removed and the bridge decks rebuilt. Even though the original shape of the spans and piers remained, the loss of ornamentation significantly altered the bridges and they are no longer capable of contributing to the historic nature of the Civic Center district. The Court Avenue Bridge was reconstructed in the 1980s and its decorative elements were left in place. The railroad bridges have always been seen as intrusions in the district and it was suggested the railroad right of way be moved when the bridges were in need to significant repairs or replacement. Architecture Five of the six buildings in the Civic Center Historic District were built between 1900 and 1928 (library, post office, municipal building, municipal court building, U.S. Courthouse) and are all designed in the Beaux-Arts style. They are further unified by the use of architectural elements such as the use of stone, rustication, full-height stone columns, balustrades, simple cornices and round-arched openings. The City Beautiful movement planned buildings that were intended to blend with each other and work as a unit rather than stand apart as a monument to an architect's design. Inspiration for the district came from the White City of Chicago's 1893 Columbian Exposition, the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, and European urban design in general on public building design. Even though it was designed in the Art Deco style, the Armory building blends in with the other buildings in the district. The river walls were designed to be both ornamental as well as functional. Built of concrete, they feature the balustrade motif that was utilized on the public buildings and the bridges. The Court Avenue Bridge also utilizes balustrades in its design as well as the rounded arch, which is also featured in the buildings. The Scott Avenue Bridge over the Des Moines River and the Riverside Bridge over the Raccoon River are both open-spandrel reinforced concrete arch-type bridges. They are both located near the confluence of the two rivers. Both bridges were completed in 1937 and were funded through the Works Progress Administration. The Scott Avenue Bridge also has a dam associated with it. It is a concrete overflow dam and was built at the same time as the bridge. The dam is eight bays across with an overflow section in the two end bays. It utilizes a gate structure of three small vertical slide gates. Both sanitary and storm sewer lines flow through the dam. It anchors the southern end of the historic district. Anchoring the northern end is the Center Street dam. It is also the terminal point for the river walls. Built in 1917, it is a concrete, multiple arch and buttress type dam. This dam features a free overflow section that is divided into eleven bays and a gate section composed of three vertical slide gates.

Father, Trofim Antonovich, died at the war front on August 3, 1943, and buried in the communal grave in the Voroshilovgrad region. Anatoly Chernousov was raised by his mother, Evdokiya Ivanovna, and his grandfather, Anton Fomich who taught him to ‚Äúpersevere in every work‚Äù. The writer's biography is typical for his time. His memories about his difficult postwar childhood amidst the native population of South-Western Siberia, the chaldons, served as a base for his novel The Chaldons. Biography In 1959, after graduating from the Omsk Polytechnic Institute Chernousov worked as a designing engineer at the Siblitmash factory, then taught engineering at the Novosibirsk Railway Transportation Institute. Parallel to this work, he was actively involved in the social work: he was a Pioneer leader and a youth leader at the Physics and Mathematics school at Siberian Branch of USSR Academy of Sciences. He traveled a lot with his students. Backpacking, trekking and skiing, Chernousov crossed the Carpathians mountings, Polesye (Belorussia), Crimea, Caucasus, the Altai Mountains, Sayan, Mountain Shoria, the Baltics, the Volga, the Urals and the Caspian Sea. He also went kayaking on the Irtysh, boating at the Teletskoye Lake, on the Angara, Lake Baikal and the Dnieper. Chernousov descended to the caves with the speliologues and took part in the expeditions to the site of the meteorite Tunguska. During the Soviet time, when foreign travel was often out of reach for the Intelligentsia, he visited Italy, Greece, India, and Ceylon. In 1974, Anatoly Chernousov was admitted to the Union of Soviet Writers. Since 1975, his main literary activity is combined with the work in the journal \\"Siberian Lights.\\" In 1987, he was awarded the Order \\"Badge of Honor.\\" In 1973, he married Anna Pavlovna Pavlyukevich (Moscow Polygraphic Institute graduate in Publishing and Journalism, 1974). They had two daughters, Julia (1974) and Olga (1984). During Perestroika, Anatoly Chernousov led the Novosibirsk regional writers' organization. On June 24, 2000, he died in Novosibirsk. Works In 1968, the \\"Siberian Lights\\" (Sibirskie ogni) publishes his first short story Engineer Zabrodin‚Äôs hobby. This first publication drew the attention of readers and critics with its acute psychological themes and characters. Chernousov's first book, The crews must be prepared, was published in 1971 in the West Siberian publishing house. It announced the voice of a new type of protagonist: \\"We shouldn‚Äôt continue living like this, comrades. We need to find something new and interesting ...\\" In 1979, the novel The crews must be prepared was made by the national TV channel into a two-part music film Breakfast on the Grass. In the novel Unusual task (1975), the protagonist, a young scientist Pavel Smirnov, is close to solving a scientific problem. However, in the middle of experimentation, he is sent to a collective farm to support students coming to assist villagers during the potato harvest. The novel tells the realities of village life in the Soviet times, and the relationship between Pavel and the students. Shturmovshchina (rushed production), the soviet industrial phenomenon, became the subject of the novel Intern (1975). The pervasive problem is seen through the eyes of an intern, student Andrey Skvortsov, who, with youthful enthusiasm, challenges his colleagues with a question they can not answer: \\"What will happen tomorrow?\\" This book was applauded by critics and the press. Strangers (1979) tells the tragic love story of a couple - Valeriy Klimov, a professor and his student Lina Zima, a Baptist. After making love with Valeriy, Lina is afraid of being ostracized by her family and she kills herself. The author was surprised when the novel was used as a base for the atheist debates. Second home (1984), a completely autobiographical novel, describes the chore of building a country house in the 80s. The author and his young family, eager to find an escape from the bustle of the city, move into the countryside. Their first experiences with gardening, and friendships with the natives are told with humor but are also melancholic. Circles (1990) narrates a story of a draftsman Kostya Zarubin, his rejection of human indifference, callousness and cynicism. Faith and faithlessness, strangeness and ardor of first love are some of the themes of the novel. Chernousov's novels and short stories appeared regularly in journals \\"Siberian Lights\\" (Sibirskie Ogni), \\"Smena\\", \\"Ural Ranger,\\" (Uralskiy Sledopit), \\"Soviet Literature\\"(Sovetskaya literatura), \\"Our Contemporary‚Äù (Nash Sovremennik), in the \\"Roman-Gazeta\\", and the \\"Literary Gazette\\" (Literaturnaya gazeta). Many short stories were translated and published in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland.

He was the editor-in-chief and director of the Detskaya Literatura publishing house. Early life Aleksandr Vinogradov was born in 1930 in Skrylevo, then a village in Moscow Oblast (now in Tver Oblast). In 1935 he supercooled his ears and had to go through an operation, as a result of which, however, he was able to keep his hearing. His younger cousin Dmitry (born 1931), who had also supercooled his ears, was unable to survive the operation and died. He soon moved to Leningrad where he went to school. However, in 1941, after the city had been surrounded by the German army, he managed to escape with his mother and sisters. His father, Aleksandr, stayed and died from hunger in early 1942. Aleksandr Jr. returned to his village, which became part of the newly formed Kalinin Oblast. During the war he worked at a kolkhoz called the Dawn of the Communes (Zarya Kommun). After the end of the war, he resumed his studies at school but had to take a sabbatical in 1947, when he got sick with tuberculosis. However, he was able to survive the life-threatening disease and came back to school. Professional career In 1950 Aleksandr Vinogradov entered the journalism faculty of the Leningrad State University. Upon graduation in 1955, he became a correspondent for the Red Kurgan (Krasnyy Kurgan) newspaper and moved to Kurgan. In 1957 he became an editor for the Young Leninets (Molodoy Leninets) newspaper. In 1959 he had his first trip abroad to China. In 1960 Aleksandr Vinogradov was transferred to Moscow. He became an instructor in the propaganda and campaigning department of the Komsomol. In 1962 he became deputy editor of the Komsomol life department for the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily. In 1963 he was appointed editor of the Our relatives (Nashy rodnye) department of the Vokrug Sveta magazine. This department was responsible for animal stories. In 1964 he became editor-in-chief of the Young Naturalist (Yunyy Naturalist) magazine. At the same time, he began writing stories, mostly describing his foreign trips and the impressions he got from visiting the different countries, such as the United States (Rock and Roll on the Knees), China (On the Shore of the Mighty Yangtze), Japan (The Bitter Smile of the Samurai), Mexico (Aztecs: The 20th Century). In January 1975 Aleksandr Vinogradov became editor-in-chief of the Children's Literature magazine, a publishing house specializing in editing and printing works of literature for children from around the world. The Library of world literature for children was published under Vinogradov's directorship. In 1982 he became the magazine's director. In the meantime, he continued writing and moved on to more psychologically complex novels, that dealt with the issue of death and life values. It was at this time that his most famous works, At the End of the Alley (V Kontse Allei) and The Unsheathed Saber (Sablya bez Nozhen) were published. In 1984, however, Vinogradov was forced to take a break from work after suffering a heart attack. In 1985 he was transferred to the Raduga publishing house, where he took the position of deputy editor-in-chief. He retired in October 1991. Vinogradov continued writing in the 1990s and published the stories The Misfire (Osechka) in 2001 and The Murdered Daylights (Ubityye Rassvety) in 2005. Personal life Aleksandr Vinogradov was married twice. In 1951 he married Nellya Danilova, but got divorced within a year. His second marriage proved to be much longer. In 1956 he married Elvira Belinina with whom he stayed together until his death. He had one child, born in 1958. Illness and death In December 2001 Aleksandr Vinogradov suffered a stroke which had little immediate consequences, with his eyesight and balance only slightly affected. However, he soon began to develop a glaucoma on the retina of his right eye, hampering his ability to see and write. In the late 2000s he started to develop brain ischemia, leading to problems with memory, judgment and gait. Possibly affected by his son's death, his condition severely worsened in May 2011, when he became unable to stand and started experienced hallucinations. He was placed in a hospital, but that only provided temporary relief and upon discharge, his range of debilitating symptoms returned. He died on June 14, 2011 at his dacha in the village of Alyokhnovo in the Istrinsky District of Moscow Oblast, where he was being taken care of by his wife. A burial ceremony took place on June 16, 2011, and he was cremated soon afterwards. His funerary urn was placed into the crematorium wall of Troyekurovskoye Cemetery.

Besides his rabbinical duties, he acted as a liaison between the local Jewish Community and the city's religious and political figures. He was a contributor to several newspapers and published six books. Biography =Early life= Born in Szczuczyn, Poland in an observant Jewish family, he was the son of a loving mother and a father known for his knowledge and oratory. At age 13, he was accepted into the Rabbinical Seminary in Bialystock, which meant leaving his home and family in order to pursue a career as a Rabbi. According to anecdotes, his teachers and classmates used to call him \\"Moshe the sage\\". At age 18 he graduated and received the title of Rabbi. =World War II= Rabbi Kaiman fled Europe during World War II, which left a strong mark on him: his parents and siblings, as his wife's family were murdered by the Nazis at the Auschwitz concentration camp. =Cuba= In 1941, Rabbi Kaiman arrived to Cuba, where he was hired as a Rabbi. His children were born while he worked there. A Jewish friend from his hometown of Szczuszyn convinced him to move to the city of Monterrey, Mexico, to work as the Rabbi of the small local Jewish Community. In 1944, he arrived to Monterrey. =Monterrey= Rabbi Kaiman was the religious guide of the Monterrey Jewish community from 1944 until his death. Given the small size and limited resources of the community, he did not only perform the duties of Rabbi, but had to take on multiple other tasks including Hazzan, Mohel, Shochet, teacher, etc. He was the Rabbi of Monterrey for 68 years, making him the longest serving Rabbi in the world. He became a Mexican citizenship in 1993. His spiritual work was not limited to the Jewish Community. Since his arrival he formed a cordial relationship with members of other religions and the local community in general, and promoted peaceful coexistence and inter-religious dialog. He kept an \\"open door\\" policy and received visitors from all religions on a daily basis. He formed a very close friendship with Archbishop and Cardinal Adolfo Su√°rez Rivera, who referred to him as \\"brother\\". He maintained friendly ties with his successor Cardinal Francisco Robles, who is now Archbishop of Guadalajara. He was part of the committee that received Pope John Paul II on both of his visits to the city and received a thank you note from the Vatican for the Hebrew Bible he gave the Pope as a present. Between 1993 and 2006 he wrote a popular weekly column \\"Desde la Sinagoga\\" (From the Synagogue) in a local newspaper El Norte with advice on daily life. From 2007 to 2009 he wrote \\"Cartas de la Sinagoga\\" (Letters from the Synagogue) for the same newspaper. He also collaborated with El Porvenir and El Diario de Monterrey, and for the New York-based Algemeiner Journal.

Their compositions, either instrumental or vocal melodramas, poetic, lyrical, cabaret crooning are sung or spoken in different languages; English, Spanish, French, and also in Arabic, German, Turkish or Russian. Since 1985, even before the \\"Computer music\\" era, they experimented within the likes of the post-industrial musical movement (Greater Than One, Cabaret Voltaire, SPK, Coil...) using intensive sound collage and sampling techniques. This work will give birth to their motto: \\"Sample us as we have already sampled you\\". Although strongly focused around the music component, the peculiarity of Von Magnet is to endeavour the recurrent relationship between theatrical actions, dance as well as visual or performance arts, resulting in the creation of \\"staged\\" concerts.

History =London, the \\"Electroflamenco\\" initiation. El Sexo Sur Realista. 1985-1990= After a collaboration with Robert Rental (The Normal) with whom they prepared their first demo tapes, Von Magnet, helped by Hugh Griffiths at the Remaximum studios, composed their first auto-produced E.P : \\"I\\". The record, firstly confidential, was soon distributed within Europe and featured in the charts of the independent music dance clubs. Coming from the world of theatre (Flore Magnet, Samia Doukali), visual arts (Laurence Abraham, Erik Yaeger) or music (Stocha, Phil Von), the different individuals forming the group invented a style of performance which combined all of those disciplines. In parallel, they were initiated to flamenco rhythms (palmas, zapateados, palos) by dancer Nuria Garcia and guitarist Mick Jingle (members of the London Pe√±a Flamenca) who both contributed to the first showings and tours. Von Magnet met with music wizard Phil Erb (keyboard player of the group Psychic TV) as well as producer Ken Thomas (Psychic TV, Test Dept, Sigur R√≥s, Dave Gahan, The Sugarcubes, Moby, Yann Tiersen, Current 93...), with whom they achieved their album El Sexo Sur-Realista, their first Electroflamenco manifesto inspired from Federico Garcia Lorca and Salvador Dal√≠, iconic flamenco artists Camar√≥n de la Isla, Lole y Manuel, Enrique Morente as well as from early electronic acts such as Suicide, Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, The Residents...). This performance, outlined in the London underground club scenes, then presented in diverse theatre festivals (Institute of Contemporary Arts, LIFT, National Review of Live Art...) went on to tour throughout Europe with the help of the Dutch agency NL Centrum. The scenography of the performance is set around a saw dust arena (a reference to bullfighting) surrounded by television screens and two opposite stages. Metal costumes hung from the ceiling, objects made out of wire (creations of Andalusian sculptor artist Manuel Olarte), physical actions, slide projections, flamenco dance and guitar, saxophone (Stocha), singing and electronic sequences are fused together to form this first interdisciplinary piece. =\\"Cybergypsies\\", the quest for a \\"total physical theatre\\" performance. Computador & El Grito. 1990-1994= Von Magnet left London to lead a new nomadic life following the path of different residencies and tours in Europe. They settled for a while in Barcelona, then Brittany, Paris, Amsterdam and Lille. The Rencontres Transmusicales Festival commissioned them for the creation of major multidisciplinary performance. Computador was born. Partially invented inside an abandoned slaughterhouse in Badalona (Catalonia) then created in a church in Rennes, the show was later on modified and re- adapted inside old disused factories or odd alternative spaces (hospital, warehouses, etc.). With that \\"off\\" or non stage production, the band became a real collective, close to street theatre or circus companies, sometimes compared to La Fura Dels Baus. With stages on wheels, moving objects and giant sculptures (Manuel Olarte), ingenious MIDI triggering, Pani projections (designed by Thierry Noyer), futuristic characters hanging in the air, acrobatics, contemporary and flamenco dance, water, fire and welding. Computador talked about mutations, human (physical or psychological) or material (scenographic), pushing the limits which can define a performance piece, questioning the place, voyeurism and comfort of an audience as well as constantly transforming the space and actions. The troupe expanded with the encounter of Spanish performer & actress Rosa Sanchez, Austrian performer Franz F. Feigl and French musician TNO. More artists arrived to collaborate on different presentations of this big project (Mariana Bouhsira, Gregory Ryan, William Petit, Rob Verdegaal, Patricia Ruyters, John Wagland, Kate Tierney, Ken Thomas, Mick Jingle, et al.). The album Computador portrayed the soundtrack studio version of the show as a musical drama. It was recorded by Norscq (aka JLM from the cult band The Grief) and again produced in London by Ken Thomas for the French record label Danceteria. =Berlin, entrance in the world of Ballet. Nuevas Cruzes. 1995-1997= To access a different network of smaller venues on a broader scale, Flore Magnet, Laurence Abraham, Rosa Sanchez, Stocha, Phil Von & Erik Yaeger, decided to condense their favourite themes. Coming back to a new concert-performance formula, this time more accessible, the show \\"Flamenco mutants\\" took place in rock venues, discoth√®ques or art galleries. The guitarist Sigmoon, aka Pierre Vildard, joined the venture. The last chapter of their electroflamenco trilogy, El Grito, produced by Norscq for Danceteria, proposed an opus of maturity which summed up their experience of industrial gypsy life. After paying tribute to Salvador Dal√≠ (El Sexo Sur-Realista) & Andre√Ø Tarkovski (Computador), this time it is Luis Bu√±uel & Jean Cocteau who are honoured in El Grito. New guest musicians excelled on that record, Simon Lee (cajon), Micha S. Zanx (electric guitars) and Richard Cuvillier, trumpet player, composer and sound engineer who also played on the record Mezclador and live for De L'Aimant. Invited by choreographer Jan Linkens to create the ballet Nuevas Cruzes at the Komische Oper Berlin, Von Magnet mutated once again, proposing a different musical approach. More acoustic or even \\"electro-rock\\", they brought a specific selection of songs onto the opera stage in the middle of the classical ballet dancers. The percussionist J√©rome Soudan aka Mimetic (T√©tines Noires, Art Zoyd) became the first drummer of Von Magnet. Countertenor singer Fran√ßois Testory (Lindsay Kemp company), whom they met in London for El Sexo Sur- realista, was invited especially for the occasion. Nuevas Cruzes was presented in Berlin for three years, then toured throughout Europe. It is that encounter with the world of German Ballet which led Von Magnet to work for choreographer Mario Schr√∂der in Kiel (Guten Morgen Du Sch√∂ne, Fight Club) and the Anhaltisches Theater in Dessau. =The Mediterranean/oriental mix. Mezclador / El Planeta. 1997-2002= After the completion of the arrangements on the album Mezclador (produced by Norscq), Stocha (aka Alain Baumann) left Von Magnet to dedicate himself to his work with Konic Theatre. With this record, Phil Von, inspired by film director Tony Gatlif and his film Latcho Drom took Von Magnet away from its flamenco influences and approached more diverse horizons. This time the music wanders towards Oriental, Mediterranean or even Eastern European sound atmospheres. The concert-performance Mezclador experimented again with some daring ideas of scenic destabilisation, this time using three stage areas, lighting sculptures and objects (created by visual artist Angelino), television screens, vinyl scratch (musician ON OFF aka Christophe Coutant) and choreographed physical actions in the midst of the audience. Stalker Project, a performance especially designed for 3 old factories (in France, Germany & the Netherlands) was set around four cardinal stages encircling the public and featuring a special collaboration with contemporary dancer Myriam Gourfink. The next stage production El Planeta gathered Mimetic (drums, electronics), Sigmoon (acoustic & electric instruments), Flore Magnet (vocals) and Phil Von (vocals & flamenco dance), a strong quartet for a frontal concert accompanied by video projections showing the graphic cybernetic visual creations of artist Servovalve. After Phil Von‚Äôs solo album in Morocco with the Gnawareview \\"L'Autre Nuit\\" Douban musicians of F√®s (album and performances \\"L'Autre Nuit\\"review \\"L'Autre Nuit\\" by Swayri / Skyrock. 12 March 2009), Von Magnet delved into different interpretations on the thematics of rituals or trance which somehow marked the live experience of the band. Still opening up to a wider range of musical landscapes, but this time with a slight Sufi flavour, the record El Planeta, mainly programmed by Mimetic & Phil Von, held a more electronic feel. The acoustic components remained with the multi-instrumental virtuosity of Sigmoon (bouzouki, sitar, israj, santur) and the Balkan style of violin player Frank Dematte√Øs. =Back to the roots of Flamenco. De L'Aimant. 2003-2007= With the direction of two singular ‚Äúmade to measure‚Äú big scale projects, 1+1+1+ =1 a piece written for twelve young Turkish artists at the International Theatre Festival of Izmit, and Deadline Nowreview Deadline Now Heathen Harvest, 15 June 2007. by ZG created in Portugal with the company Persona for the festival Imaginarius, Von Magnet approached the world of street theatre. In 2005, Flore and Phil decided to go back to their vision of modern flamenco. De L‚ÄôAimant (literal translation of Von Magnet in French) revisited the obsessive rhythms and patterns (buleria, soleares, siguiriya, fandango...) which kept haunting the band. The discovery of young talent Sabine Van Den Oever in Den Haag allowed each song to be coloured by a touch of feminine flamenco guitar. In De L‚ÄôAimant the essence of musical theatricality, poetical lyrics and cinema references (John Cassavetes, Andre√Ø Tarkovski, David Lynch, etc.) remained. The performance, although more traditionally flamenco, was atypical. Placed on a cross shaped stage structure in the center of a venue, each branch held one of the performer/singer/guitarist/dancer, directly aimed towards the public who was invited to move around the 360¬∞ scenic installation. Yana Maizel, flamenco dancer and cajon player completed the line-up. Circular images projections were created by film maker Xavier Ameller. The last production occurred in the Mus√©e des Beaux Arts of Lille during a Francisco de Goya exhibition. The same year, Holeg Spies, electronic musician and composer, achieved Spies under Von Magnet Influence, an album made out of his own versions of classic Von Magnet songs. =Staging Magnetism. Neither Predator Nor Prey & Polarized. 2008-2013= In its own intimate poetic way Ni Pr√©dateur Ni Proie or Neither Predator Nor Prey broached the delicate subject of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the complex situation in the Middle East. The album was more instrumental but resolutely industrial, tribal (with intricate Arabic percussions) and dark. Def, who had been sound engineering and shaping the live sound of the band (and also amongst many other acts for Diamanda Galas & Balkan Beat Box), became co-composer of the project and joined Flore Magnet & Phil Von on stage. The performance created from this CD was co-produced with the help of T.O.T.E.M Materia Prima in Nancy & Emmetrop in Bourges. The piece was a metaphor of the ‚Äúwall‚Äú which stands between two human beings and two close worlds. It radically cut up the theatre hall in two halves splitting the public in two groups. Two characters lived back to back in two rooms (a kitchen and a bedroom), separated by a white wall/screen but linked to each other by a video surveillance system. With its latest performance Polarized, Von Magnet returned to the conquest of classic theatre stages and pushed the idea of the confrontation between opposite poles, neighbour territories and conflicting characters. The arrival of new members : Tit‚Äôo, electric guitar player with the groups Picore, Uzul Prod. and Oddateee, Hugues Villette (drums) half of the electronic duet 2Kilos & More, and Lisa May (performer & dancer for the company Troubleyn Jan Fabre), complete the distribution of the concert/performance created in the Theatre of Vanves & in Le Fil St Etienne.

It is located in the Highland Park neighborhood that also includes the Highland Park Historic Business District at Euclid and Sixth Avenues. The College Corner historic district has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1998. History The name for the district reflect its proximity to Highland Park College, which later became Des Moines University after a merger with Des Moines College. with The college was founded in 1889 just after the Highland Park Land Company opened up this section of Des Moines for residential development. The College Corner commercial district was associated with the college's professors and students who in general lived nearby and patronized the establishments at the intersection of Second and Euclid Avenues. The establishments included a drug store, restaurants, cafes, a bookstore and a tea room. Until 1919 the post office went back and forth between this commercial district and the one at Sixth Avenue. An Odd Fellows hall was moved here in 1907. A bank opened in the district in the early 1950s. The college was closed in 1929 and the business district continued to serve the residents of the neighborhood. The extension of the Second Avenue street car line in the early 20th century helped develop and sustain the neighborhood. In 1954 the college campus was sold to a developer who built Park Fair Shopping Center on the site. It was Iowa's first enclosed shopping center. To an extent it drew customers away from the older business district. Architecture The College Corner Commercial Historic Business District is composed of seven buildings and an empty lot. One the buildings, the Odd Fellows Hall, is three stories in height and stands at the corner of Second and Euclid. At the time it was built it was the tallest building in Des Moines outside of the central business district. There are four two-story commercial buildings and two one-story buildings. The buildings are constructed of brick with the exception of the building at 208 Euclid, which is the oldest and the last two-story frame commercial building in the district. The structures in the historic district were built from the early 1890s through 1952. The three buildings constructed in the 1890s are two-story brick buildings that feature bold cornice lines, segmental arched window hoods and narrow window openings. The storefronts on these buildings have a recessed entrance in the center, a square-cut transom above the door and large display windows on the sides. Two buildings were constructed in the first decade of the 20th century. Their features are simpler than the older buildings. Their main features are a parapet wall of corbelled brick, wider window openings and round arched window hoods. A very simple one-story building was built in the 1920s. It employed metal window frames and has a wider storefront. The last building was a single-story bank building completed in 1952 and is an example of utilitarian construction methods, which were adapted to deal with post-World War II building material shortages. It is also one of the first drive-in businesses in Des Moines.

Sisinnios first appears in Irene's unique triumphal procession on Easter Monday, 1 April 799, through the imperial capital, Constantinople.

History  The Culverden Stadium was opened in 1962 as a permanent home for Tunbridge Wells. The occasion was commemorated with a charity football match between Tunbridge Wells and a TV All Stars team which included Jess Conrad and Bernard Bresslaw. On 31 August 2005, during an FA Cup Preliminary Round Replay, the Culverden Stadium was the location of a record set for the most penalty kicks taken in a penalty shoot-out. The match was won by Tunbridge Wells against Littlehampton Town 16-15 after 40 penalty kicks. This was recognised as an FA and European record. In September 2006, the Culverden Stadium was subject to a series of vandalism attacks. The clubhouse was broken into and equipment was stolen. A later attempt was thwarted after Tunbridge Wells officials boarded the windows of the clubhouse. The record crowd at the Culverden Stadium was 1,810 set in March 2013 for an FA Vase quarter final between Tunbridge Wells and Hadleigh United. = Pitch = The Culverden Stadium was recognised in non-league football for having a poor surface. It also has a sloped pitch. To address this in 2012, Tunbridge Wells set up a pitch fund to gain funds to improve it. Usage The Culverden Stadium hosts the annual Courier Cup in August. The Culverden is also used for non-football purposes with it being used as a location for bingo.

The network broadcast programs aimed at Hispanic and Latino American audiences throughout the United States ‚Äì featuring a mix of telenovelas and other serialized dramas, reality television series, game shows, and feature films (both Spanish-dubbed versions of American films and imported films produced in Spanish-speaking countries). Headquartered in Los Angeles, MundoMax had been headed since its inception in its pre-July 2015 existence as a joint venture between RCN and U.S.-based Fox Entertainment Group (which originally operated the network through its Fox International Channels division) by network president Jose Molina. History =As MundoFox= Original logo as MundoFox, used from August 13, 2012 (or August 1 on some pending affiliates) to July 27, 2015; logo briefly remained in use as on-air bug and on official network social media pages after the rebranding to MundoMax. MundoMax traces its origins to the announcement by Fox International Channels and RCN Televisi√≥n that the two companies would jointly launch a new Spanish language television network in the United States under the MundoFox brand on January 23, 2012. Hern√°n L√≥pez, president and CEO of Fox International Channels, said that the network would cater to \\"an increasing demand for quality Spanish-language content in the U.S. from both viewers and advertisers.\\" According to 2010 United States Census data, among the 309 million people living in the U.S., 50 million of them were of some form of Hispanic and Latino heritage (totaling 16% of the total population); advertising revenue from the Hispanic/Latino market made up $3.6 billion of the $80 billion (or 4.5% of all ad revenue) in the total domestic market in 2011. L√≥pez noted that the Fox Broadcasting Company saw \\"similar dynamics in play\\" when News Corporation (the corporate parent of Fox International Channels at the time of the announcement) launched the network in October 1986 against established English language networks ABC, NBC and CBS; MundoFox, he added, would seek to replicate Fox's early years while launching against established Spanish language networks Univision, Telemundo and Azteca Am√©rica. MundoFox commenced programming with a soft launch on some of its charter affiliates on August 1, 2012; the network's formal launch occurred twelve days later on August 13. Until it rebranding as MundoMax, MundoFox was headquartered with 21st Century Fox's other U.S. television operations in Los Angeles, California. =Relaunch as MundoMax= On July 16, 2015, 21st Century Fox announced that it had sold its stake in MundoFox to RCN Televisi√≥n, giving the Colombian private broadcaster full ownership of the network. Fox International Channels president Herman Lopez stated that the company was \\"proud of having started MundoFox with RCN and are confident that they will realize all of the potential of the network.\\" On July 28, 2015, RCN announced that it would rebrand the network as MundoMax effective that day; the name change and new imaging package was fully implemented on-air two weeks later on August 13, coinciding with the third anniversary of the network's launch; however, the logo used by the network under the MundoFox identity remained in use as on-screen bug during programming and on the network's Facebook and Twitter accounts until the rebrand was completed. Additionally, RCN announced that it had shut down the network's news division, with company representatives arguing that news programming was \\"never part of the plan\\" for the network. The folding of the news division resulted in the layoff of 35 staff members as a result. On July 31, network president Ibra Morales stated regarding the move that \\"although we have cancelled Noticias MundoFox, RCN Television Group continues its dedication to bringing quality news coverage to the vibrant and dynamic U.S. Hispanic community\\". =Closure= It was announced by RCN Television that MundoMax would end operations and all affiliation contracts on November 30, 2016 and lay off dozens of employees in several departments, including administration, programming, promotions, research and sales in Los Angeles, New York and Miami.MundoMax to go off air at local stations; lays off staff - Media Moves (published October 6, 2016) It was further confirmed on November 10, 2016. The network cited low ratings (which had not been tabulated since Nielsen Media terminated their contract with the network at the end of September), along with an affiliate base which was unable to acquire cable carriage due to their mainly low-power status where must-carry status was unable to be executed. Several affiliates switched to Estrella TV, with Azteca and other Spanish-language networks also taking advantage.http://www.mediamoves.com/2016/11/mundomax-shut-estrella-tv-takes- affiliates.html Media Moves (published November 10, 2016) The network went off the air without any ceremony at 11:59 p.m. ET the night of November 30.MundoMax Ends Run on Last Affiliates KWHY and WGEN - Media Moves (published December 2, 2016)Retrieved on December 8, 2016 Programming MundoMax operated on a 126-hour network programming schedule, which it adopted in January 2015. It provided general entertainment programming to owned-and- operated and affiliated stations Monday through Fridays from 8:30 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. and Saturdays and Sundays from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. Children's programming blocks under the brands \\"NatGeoKids\\" and \\"XtremaMax\\" ‚Äì the former of which features programs compliant with FCC educational programming requirements ‚Äì aired for three hours each Sunday starting at 9:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. All other time periods were filled with religious programming or infomercials. MundoMax had production and distribution agreements with companies including network parent RCN, former co-parent Fox International Channels and 21st Century Fox-owned Shine Group (which produced the company's first Spanish-language programs for the network); RCN co-owned NTN24 and Fox Deportes originally supplied content for the network prior to the divestiture of Fox's interest. Prior to the launch of what began as MundoFox, Fox International Channels was already a major producer of Spanish-language programming and sports for its Latin American and U.S. Hispanic-oriented cable channels, with some of the international programs being distributed to the network for broadcast in the United States. RCN is one of the largest producers and exporters of Spanish-language television programming, and had previously provided content mainly to Univision sister network TeleFutura (now UniM√°s); it stopped committing productions to other Hispanic-targeted networks in the U.S. in anticipation of MundoFox's launch. Brazilian novelas such as Jos√© do Egito and Lado a Lado also aired as did a dubbed version of the Turkish series Muhte≈üem Y√ºzyƒ±l under the title \\"Suleim√°n - El Gran Sult√°n.\\" A signature program format on MundoMax was the \\"teleseries\\", which produced fewer episodes compared to telenovelas traditionally seen on Spanish-language television (roughly 80 versus an average of 120), but emphasized action-oriented storylines, diverse locations and increased production values. One such teleseries that appeared on MundoFox at its launch was El Capo, a show produced for RCN by Fox Telecolombia. Once- a-week series are also featured ‚Äì which air on weekend evenings ‚Äì including fellow inaugural programs Kdabra and Tiempo Final (\\"No Return\\"); the network also airs current and classic telenovelas during the daytime hours (among the initial titles featured on its daytime lineup included Yo Soy Betty, la Fea (\\"I Am Betty, the Ugly\\"), the Colombian series that served as the basis for the Televisa novela La Fea M√°s Bella and the ABC comedy-drama series Ugly Betty, which returned to the network in November 2014). Telenovelas originally aired on the network only on weekdays and in late-night on Saturdays; in April 2014, the network added a three-hour block of comedic and seriocomic telenovelas on Saturday afternoons (which was inaugurated with the network debuts of La Playita (\\"The Beach\\"), Las Clinicas (\\"The Clinic\\") and the teen- oriented Chica Vampiro (\\"Vampire Girl\\")). Until June 30, 2014, MundoFox filled much of its late night and early morning schedule with same-day repeats of telenovelas and teleseries from its daytime schedule as well as novelas exclusive to the late night schedule; the network dropped the overnight and morning repeats on July 1, 2014, replacing them with a mix of Spanish-dubbed and English language infomercials in the 1:00 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time slot, giving it the highest infomercial total of any fully programmed commercial television network in the U.S. (MundoFox's nine hours of daily paid programming content surpassed the six hours carried by competitor Estrella TV among the Spanish broadcast networks, and the eight hours carried by Ion Television (until that network reduced its infomercial block to six hours in January 2015) amongst all networks). Lifestyle programs (consisting of how-to and cooking series) also aired on the network during the morning hours, particularly on Saturdays; the network also aired game shows, including 100 latinos dijeron (\\"100 Latinos Said\\"; which was based on Family Feud) and the now-cancelled Minuto para ganar (which continued to air in reruns as of 2015, and was based on Minute to Win It). The network also aired feature films on weekend afternoons, Saturday evenings and select major holidays (such as Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day), under the umbrella brand \\"Cine MundoMax\\" (originally \\"Cine MundoFox\\" until July 26, 2015), consisted of a mix of films produced in Spanish (mainly those from predominately first-language Spanish-speaking countries such as Mexico) or Spanish-dubbed versions of movies originally produced in English (including many produced by sister film studio 20th Century Fox and its subsidiaries). The network also originally aired Spanish dubs of select Fox series (such as Bones and American Dad!), which were dropped from the schedule by January 2014. Many of the initial original scripted series that air on MundoFox were produced in Colombia, though the network planned to produce U.S.-based series by its second year at the latest. Even though the network's initial slogan was Americano como t√∫ (\\"American Like You\\"), MundoFox's president at the time, Emiliano Saccone, said during its 2013-14 upfront presentation that he planned for the network to increase its \\"Mexican flavor.\\" It is unknown if any of the programs on MundoMax will air on any other Spanish networks once the shutdown occurred at the end of November. However, its website continued to offer free streaming episodes until mid-December 2016. =News programming= From August 2012 until July 2015 as MundoFox, the network operated its own news division, Noticias MundoFox (\\"MundoFox News\\"), which aimed to offer content that was conscious of the Hispanic market in the United States, and the diversity and sensitivities of the different demographics that comprise that market. Noticias MundoFox's operations included a Los Angeles-based newsroom and a bureau in Washington, D.C., as well as international news content from RCN Televisi√≥n's sister international cable news channel, NTN24. The Noticias MundoFox division was operated independently from Fox News Channel, which produces Fox News Sunday and other news content for MundoFox's sister English- language broadcast network, Fox. Noticias MundoFox produced a weekday evening news program of the same name, which was anchored for most of its run by Rolando Nichols (formerly of the network's Los Angeles affiliate KWHY-TV), that originated from Los Angeles; two live half-hour newscasts were produced every weekday, one for the east coast and the other for the west coast (originally airing at 6:00 p.m., before moving to 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time in 2013) as well as a pre-recorded newscast at 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time (which also originally aired at 10:00 p.m. Eastern until 2013), which was lighter in tone compared to the 5:30 p.m. edition. In 2013, the network launched a supplementary news and features program, MundoFox Y Ya! (\\"MundoFox Now\\"), which served as a lead-in to the flagship Noticias MundoFox broadcasts. In addition to conventional news programming, the network also produced Central Fox en MundoFox (\\"Fox Central on MundoFox\\"), an hour-long late night sports highlight and analysis program on Sundays produced by Fox Deportes that was cancelled in January 2015; it also produced an afternoon entertainment news and talk program, Que No Te Cuenten (\\"What They Won't Tell You\\"), which lasted until its cancellation in August 2014. Under Fox, MundoFox planned to further expand the amount of news programming on its schedule over time; to help bolster its news division, in November 2012, MundoFox tapped former CNN anchor Rick Sanchez, a contributor to Fox News and its Fox News Latino companion website, to present daily contributions to Noticias MundoFox and host several news specials for the network. However, RCN's takeover of the network led to Noticias MundoFox being cancelled on July 28, 2015, with its time slots being replaced by dubbed reruns of the TruTV caught-on-tape video programs Most Shocking and Most Daring. All the network's news staff, including on-air talent was fired as a result of the shutdown of the news division. =Sports programming= Sports programming featured on MundoMax formerly had U.S. Spanish-language broadcast rights to the Ultimate Fighting Championship. These rights were effectively lost in the FIC/RCN split, and the network carried no sporting events unless they were time brokered through an outside company. =Children's programming= In September 2012, shortly after it launched as MundoMax, the network debuted a weekend morning children's program block ‚Äì which originally aired on both Saturdays and Sundays, before being relegated exclusively to Sunday mornings in 2013 ‚Äì that was produced in conjunction with National Geographic Kids and Bento Box Entertainment, \\"National Geographic Ni√±os\\", which featured live-action and animated series selected to comply with educational programming guidelines set by the Federal Communications Commission; in January 2015, the block was extended to a stripped format, with a half-hour of educational programs airing on weekdays and an additional hour on Sunday mornings. In September 2013, the network launched a secondary two- hour-long children's program block on Sunday mornings, \\"XtremaFox\\", consisting of action-oriented animated series. Following the rebranding as MundoMax, the network's non-E/I children's programming was branded under the banner name \\"XtremaMax\\", while the E/I programming was branded under the name \\"MundoMax Kids\\". With the RCN takeover, the Bento Box/National Geographic block was dropped for programming imported from Colombia by RCN in a three-hour Saturday-only block, including Historias clasificadas, Betty Toons, and a Spanish dub of the former PBS series It's a Big Big World (known in Spanish as Gran Gran Mundo). A Spanish dub of the PBS Kids Sprout series Wibbly Pig aired on Monday mornings to fulfill the full three hour requirements. Stations , MundoMax had current and pending affiliation agreements with 60 additional television stations in 57 television markets, encompassing 22 U.S. and two Mexican states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. possession of Puerto Rico. Counting only conventional terrestrial affiliates, the network had a combined national reach of 38.83% of all households in the United States (or 121,322,371 Americans with at least one television set). In the eight months between the announcement of its formation and the network's formal launch, MundoMax expected to have an estimated national affiliate reach of 75% of U.S. households with at least one television set at the time of its launch. By early March 2012, the network reached charter affiliation deals with 20 stations including KWHY-TV in Los Angeles (which served as the network's West Coast flagship station), WJAN-CD in Miami, KGMC in Fresno and KFWD in Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth. These early deals gave MundoFox affiliates in five of the top 10 Hispanic markets and cover at least 40% of U.S. Hispanic households. However, MundoMax's affiliation with WJAN-CD ended on December 28, 2012 with the network's programming moving to full-power station WGEN-TV, then owned by Caracol Television (RCN's main rival in Colombia) through subsidiary Mapale LLC. 48 stations from MundoMax's initial 50-station affiliate body also committed to developing in-house news departments to provide locally-produced Spanish-language newscasts to the markets served by the stations, a small number of whom did not have a Spanish-language news option on local television at the time of the network's launch (KWHY and WGEN-TV already operated their own news departments; the former shut down its news operation in August 2015, when RCN Televisi√≥n took over KWHY's operations under an outsourcing agreement with its owners, the Meruelo Group). Some affiliates that did not carry full- fledged newscasts had the option to produce two-minute local news capsules inserted into the network‚Äôs Noticias MundoFox national evening newscasts, weather updates or air local public affairs programming. Any remaining affiliates prior to the closure on November 30, 2016 had already exercised the option to switch to similar Spanish programming or change affiliations/formats altogether. In the third quarter of 2016 alone, affiliates in Puerto Rico, Dallas, Chicago, and a few other markets have abruptly changed programming or went silent. Internet presences MundoMax maintained a website, streaming episodes of the network's existing primetime series after ceasing on-air operations, though there is little notice about it leaving the air. The network's Twitter account was cleared of the network's tweets since October 2012 days before its end, along with their Instagram. The MundoMax Facebook also remained active in an unmonitored state (besides automated posts from RCN's \\"Es Trending\\"), with questions about the network's demise going unanswered by the page's moderators. As of December 4, 2016, the Facebook page has been deactivated, and a couple weeks after that, the website redirects to the URL of RCN Nuestra Tele, RCN's international subscription network which remains carried in the \\"Latino\\" or \\"Hispanic\\" tier of most American pay television systems. Legal issues One day prior to MundoMax closing down, KM Communications (the owner of then-affiliated station WOCK-CD in Chicago) filed a lawsuit against the network, alleging fraud, breach of contract, unfair business practices and false promises with no intention to keep them (mainly involving the network acting as WOCK-CD's agent for advertising sales), seeking a jury trial and $525,000 in damages. Belinda Vega, an attorney who represents KM LPTV says \\"MundoMax committed to certain obligations and failed to fulfill their promises.\\".Chicago station sues MundoMax for fraud and breach of contract - Media Moves (published November 29, 2016) References Category:RCN Televisi√≥n Category:Television channels and stations established in 2012 Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2016 Category:Former News Corporation subsidiaries Category:Spanish-language television networks in the United States Category:Defunct television networks in the United States ","title":"MundoMax"},{"id":"34472510","text":"Mahrokhi Kalleh Jub (, also Romanized as MƒÅhrokhƒ´ Kalleh J≈´b) is a village in Beyranvand-e Jonubi Rural District, Bayravand District, Khorramabad County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

It was built by abolitionist James C. Jordan and was a station on the Underground Railroad in Iowa. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1973. James C. Jordan Jordan was a cattle farmer from Virginia, although the area is now in West Virginia, who settled in central Iowa in 1846. As a businessman he organized the State Bank of Des Moines and was involved in bringing the railroad to Des Moines. He platted Valley Junction and raised $70,000 to create a railhead there, which was also near his cattle operation. Today the area is the city of West Des Moines. As a civic leader he served on the Polk County Board of Supervisors, and was elected to both the Iowa Senate and the Iowa House of Representatives. While in the state legislature he led the effort to move the state capital from Iowa City to Des Moines. with Jordan was married twice. He and his first wife Melinda had six children. After her death, he married Cynthia Adams and the family grew to eleven children. History James Jordan's first dwelling in Polk County was a lean-to tent that he replaced with a log cabin in 1848. Two years later construction started on the present house. They moved into the basement when it was completed. It was divided into a kitchen and a bed/sitting room. In 1851 the first phase of the upper floors was completed. The white frame house is two stories tall. The first phase of the house featured an elegant entrance, two large rooms on the first floor and a walnut staircase that led to two large bedrooms on the second floor. The kitchen remained in the basement. Before the American Civil War the house was a station on the Underground Railroad. Jordan, who was a staunch abolitionist, was considered the chief conductor in Polk County. John Brown stayed in the house at least two times, and one of those times he was leading 12 slaves to freedom. The house was also a place where travelers stopped on their journeys to the American West. It was also a gathering place for local businessmen and politicians. The house was expanded in 1870. The addition provided space for another parlor, a dining room, library, and kitchen. Porches were added to the east and south sides of the house. A second entrance was also added with another black walnut staircase to the six additional bedrooms on the second floor. The Jordan family continued to live in the house until 1947 when it was sold to the Church of the Nazarene who used the house as a part of their summer campground. The West Des Moines Historical Society bought the house in 1978. They renovated it as a period house and use it as a museum.

Built in 1898 after a controversy surrounding the bidding process, it is one of the last Pratt through truss bridges left in an urban setting in Iowa. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998 as a part of the Highway Bridges of Iowa MPS. History The bridge was built amidst controversy in the late 19th century. The first controversy that the bridge faced was its placement. The bridge was first suggested in 1896. The aldermen on the west side of town wanted a bridge over the Raccoon River at Fifth Street. The aldermen on the east side thought that a bridge was needed over the Des Moines River at East Sixth Street to better serve that part of town. After some delay, the Fifth Street bridge was provided for with a Sixth Street bridge to be built the following year. with The second controversy, which ended up before the Iowa Supreme Court, had to do with the contract to build the bridge. J.H. Killmar won the contract with a low bid of $19,100. The other bidders charged that the specifications for the bridge were too general and Killmar's plans were flawed. Killmar had underbid the bridge combine by $5,000. The combine, or pool, had been established by the bridge building industry to counteract the ruthless competition that occurred during the bidding process as the result of the economic depression from 1873 to 1879. Killmar had been given more detailed plans for the bridge, but the city council said the other companies would have been given those plans had they asked for them. The lower court agreed with the combine, but on October 20, 1897 the Iowa Supreme Court sided with Killmar saying the specifications the other companies were given were adequate and that the work was not let for too large a sum. Killmar had planned to start construction in the fall of 1897, however, those plans had to be delayed because the steel for the piers and the superstructure had not arrived. The Des Moines Leader reported that the delay was due to the King Bridge Company who was responsible for supplying the steel and was one of the companies that was outbid for the contract to construct the bridge. King Bridge delayed work on the bridge until after the 60 days the plaintiffs had to demand a rehearing. Work was delayed until the spring of 1898 and the structure was completed on June 17, 1898. The bridge was used for vehicle traffic until 1993 when it was closed and was used after that as part of a recreational trail. In 2013, the bridge was up for demolition. Several neighborhood and city associations attempted to stop the demolition with no success by December 2013, but then they raised $2.3 million to stabilize and rebuild it, and the city of Des Moines agreed to pay the $750,000 it had planned to use for demolition toward the project, plus another $125,000 later on, as well as $500,000 from a state grant. The bridge was restored and reopened on Friday, November 11, 2016. Design The Southwest Fifth Street Bridge is one of a few pinned Pratt through truss bridges with three or more spans left in the state of Iowa. It is also one of only three left in an urban setting in the state. The structure is composed of three six- panel, pin-connected steel Pratt through trusses. Each span is for a total span length of . The roadway is wide. The steel structure rests on top of stone abutments and steel cylinder piers filled with concrete. The bridge was designed by L. Higgins, the Des Moines City Engineer, based on a bridge design fabricated by The King Bridge Company.

Leibler served as president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry and Chairman of the Governing Board of the World Jewish Congress. He was a leader in the global campaign on behalf of Soviet Jewry and played a role in the lead-up to Israeli diplomatic relations between India and China. Liebler and his wife moved to Israel in 1999, settling in Jerusalem. He writes weekly columns in the Jerusalem Post, the Hebrew daily Israel Hayom, and on his blog Candidly Speaking from Jerusalem.Candidly Speaking from Jerusalem www.wordfromjerusalem.com Liebler married Naomi Porush in 1958, and the couple had three sons and a daughter.

Soviet Jewry Leibler involvement in the fight for Soviet Jewry was first solicited by Shaul Avigur, the head of Nativ (the then-covert agency dealing with Soviet Jews) who played an enormous role behind the scenes in the formulation of policy during the early years of the state.http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Article.aspx?id=193595 In 1962, Mr. Leibler engineered a public campaign which resulted in Australia becoming the first country in the world to raise the plight of Soviet Jewry at the United Nations. In 1965, he published Soviet Jewry and Human Rights.http://wordfromjerusalem.com/?page_id=321 Before the collapse of the Soviet Empire, Leibler made numerous visits to the Soviet Union and developed close associations with the leading Jewish dissidents and refuseniks, which he still maintains in Israel. The visits came to an end in 1980 with his arrest and expulsion from the Soviet Union. When Gorbachev liberalised the system, Leibler became the first international Jewish leader to be invited to the Soviet Union to evaluate the changes. He subsequently launched the first Jewish cultural centre in the Soviet Union ‚Äì the Solomon Mykhoels Centre in Moscow,A Jewish Center, Officially Approved, Will Open in Moscow, New York Times February 1989 https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/08/world/a-jewish-center- officially-approved-will-open-in- moscow.html?scp=1&sq;=isi%20leibler%20soviet&st;=cse together with the first Hebrew Song Festivals in Moscow and Leningrad.

He met with Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen ahead of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and both countries. Leibler also convened a colloquium for leading Jewish and Chinese scholars in Beijing prior to diplomatic relations being instituted between Israel and China. World Jewish Congress Leibler occupied senior roles in the World Jewish Congress (WJC), an umbrella organisation representing global Jewry, including Chairman of the Governing Board and Senior Vice President. Controversy In 2004 Leibler confronted the leadership of the WJC over the issue of governance, financial transparency, and financial irregularities. The conflict between Leibler and WJC Chairman Israel Singer revolved around the former's demand for an investigation into the transfer of $1.2 million from the organization's New York headquarters to a bank account in Geneva, and the subsequent transfer of the money by Singer into a trust account held by his friend.Money shifting uproar shakes World Jewish Congress, New York Times November 2004 https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/30/national/30charity.html?

Funk in 1864. It was the first periodical of the \\"Old\\" Mennonite Church (MC) and was also published in German as the Herold der Wahrheit. Funk published the Herald through Charles Hess of Chicago, Illinois, until 1867, when Funk's own company, John F. Funk & Brother (later the Mennonite Publishing Company) took over publication in Elkhart, Indiana. The newspaper was sold to the Mennonite Publication Board in 1908. History The first issue was published 1 January 1864 in Chicago, Illinois. At the end of the first year, there were 1,200 subscribers. The Herald was filled with sermons and biblical exegesis as well as stories of horrific deaths or warnings about keeping the Sabbath holy. While, at several times in the late 1860s and early 1870s, John F. Funk called for \\"an original number,\\" the pages usually also featured selections from other evangelical periodicals or Anabaptist works. =Elkhart, Indiana= In 1867, founder John F. Funk moved his operation to Elkhart, Indiana, bringing 1,200 lbs. of type with him as well as a Cylinder press, reportedly the first in Elkhart. Funk printed the newspaper in the basement of a drug store until Funk built premises. By 1892, John F. Funk's Mennonite Publishing Company had 5 presses and 2 paper cutters. =Mennonite Immigration from Russia= The German-language edition, Herold der Wahrheit, reached German-speaking Mennonites living in colonies in the Russian Empire. The newspaper drew them into conversation with John F. Funk, who then arranged fundraising to aid their immigration to the United States and organized the logistics of their travel. Though Funk began corresponding with Cornelius Jansen as early as 1871, the news of the possibility of Russian Mennonite immigration was kept out of the Herald of Truth until the summer of 1872. From that point onward, however, the Herald of Truth kept its readers abreast of the developments, including the description, in August 1872, of the four young men who had come as a kind of advance guard. =Decline= Various factors seem to have led to the decline of the Mennonite Publishing Company and the sale of the Herald of Truth and the Company's other publications. In God Uses Ink, the institutional history of the Mennonite Publishing House, John A. Hostetler argues some of these factors include: conflict within Funk's church that led to removal from his position of Bishop in 1902, bankruptcy due to a bank failure in 1904, increasing competition from the Mennonite Tract and Book Society as well as the Gospel Witness (formed in 1905), and finally a devastating fire in 1907. James C. Juhnke suggests that many of those factors (other than the bank failure and the fire, of course) reflected Funk's personal unwillingness to yield control to a younger generation of Mennonite publishers and leaders. In any case, all of the Mennonite Publishing Company's periodicals were sold to the Mennonite Publishing Board for $8,000 in 1908. Beginning April 4, 1908, the Mennonite Publishing House issued the Gospel Herald, titled by taking one word from each of its preceding periodicals and edited by Daniel Kauffman.  Digital version and research materials  The entire run of Herald of Truth (1864-1908) and German language edition Herold der Wahrheit (1864-1901) are available online. Herald of Truth founder John F. Funk's personal papers are housed in the Mennonite Church USA Archives.

The show, which follows the adventures of two friends, is set on a series of small islands on a lake in a park in an unnamed city. The show was first broadcast on CBeebies in the United Kingdom in September 2011, and is produced by Ragdoll Productions. Characters The Adventures of Abney & Teal centres on two animated rag dolls named Abney and Teal who live on an island in a lake in a park in a city. Abney lives in a hut at the base of a tree. Teal sleeps in the branches of the tree, with her only possessions a blanket and an umbrella. Abney & Teal share their environment with several friends: * Neep, a small burrowing turnip-like creature. * Bop, an aquatic mammal somewhat resembling a furry male elephant seal who drinks 'tea' (actually water from the lake) and blows bubbles. * The Poc-Pocs, a set of 7 identical-shaped but different-sized comma-shaped wooden objects or hard tropical tree seeds, so named after the noise they make jumping about. Their first appearance was in the first episode, \\"The Porridge Party\\". * Toby Dog, a melodeon-playing dog who always sits upright on the same place on the lake's mainland shore. He normally plays the same tune, which the narrator describes as several sorts of music. There are rare occasions where Toby Dog will play a variation of his tune, notably the lullaby on the episode Bop's babies. From time to time Neep's 'friends and relations' come to visit. They look much like Neep but are different colours and have varying other features. For example, Zeep has a long blond moustache and Meep wears glasses. Production The show is produced by Anne Wood who, as founder of Ragdoll Productions, had previously brought successful children's shows such as Teletubbies and In the Night Garden... to BBC Television. Wood stated that she had been an admirer of Stewart's picture books and their \\"distinct brand of gentle, fantastical humour and exquisite drawing style\\", but stated that it was his work on the book Addis Berner Bear Forgets that prompted her to contact the author. As well as creator Stewart is also the series director, and spent three years working on the show before it aired. Stewart stated in 2011 that the characters were all original constructs, designed in his sketchbooks, and the inspiration for the setting came from a visit to Victoria Park in East London. The show is co-written by Steve Roberts and Matilda Tristram. The show is narrated by British actor Adrian Scarborough who also provides the voice for Abney, while Teal is voiced by Shingai Shoniwa, who is best known as the lead singer of the Noisettes music band. None of the other characters have speaking roles, apart from Neep's ability to say his own name. Each episode is roughly eleven minutes long. The first series of 26 episodes started airing in the United Kingdom during September 2011. The show is aimed at 3-6 year-olds, but has been recognised for its adult friendly style, which harks back to earlier British children's programmes, drawing comparisons with the work of Oliver Postgate. BBC licensing manager, Julie Kekwith, acknowledged the show's retro-feel in 2011, stating \\"we're sure [it] will appeal to adults and parents as well as children.\\" and that the show has a \\"unique nostalgic and literary feel\\". While Kate Monaghan in a 2011 review described the animation as having an \\"old- fashioned, puppet-esque feel\\", Fernando De Jesus of ITV Studios commented that the show has a \\"sort of chic brashness\\". In January 2012 it was announced that the show would be further promoted by a range of soft toys and games, made by Rainbow Designs. The first six episodes of Series 2 were broadcast in April 2012. The remaining episodes began airing on 28 October 2012. Series 2 also had 26 episodes.

Instituted in 1933, they were offered to newlywed couples in the form of vouchers for household goods, initially on condition that the woman stopped working. Unless the husband's earnings were very low, interest rates on the loans continued to be lower if only he worked; and one quarter of the principal was forgiven for each child. Marriage loans were created by the \\"Law for the Reduction of Unemployment\\" of June 1, 1933.Klaus-J√∂rg Ruhl, Brauner Alltag: 1933-1939 in Deutschland, Fotografierte Zeitgeschichte, D√ºsseldorf: Droste, 1981, , p. 63 Cornelia Schmitz-Berning, Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus, Berlin/New York: de Gruyter, 1998, , p. 161 Aryan newlyweds were eligible to receive an interest-free loan of 1,000 Reichsmarks,Richard Grunberger, A Social History of the Third Reich, London: Weidenfeld, 1971, , p. 235. in the form of vouchers in the husband's name that could be redeemed for household goods such as furniture.Matthew Stibbe, Women in the Third Reich, London: Arnold / New York: Oxford University, , pp. 40-41. The amount was approximately one fifth of average annual take-home pay;Stibbe, p. 40. industrial workers earned 140 RM a month.Ruhl, p. 64. Initially, the loans required that the bride stop work immediately and not take another position during the life of the loan unless the husband was earning less than 125 RM per month. Planners hoped that the loan programme would cause 800,000 women to leave the workforce over the first four years, and there was an associated programme of subsidies for household goods manufacture intended to provide jobs for another 200,000 men.David Schoenbaum, Hitler's Social Revolution: Class and Status in Nazi Germany 1933-1939, 1966, repr. New York/London: Norton, 1980, , p. 181. In November 1933, the V√∂lkischer Beobachter featured as a \\"shining\\" example the mass wedding and subsequent resignations of 122 female employees of the Reemtsma cigarette factory in Berlin, who thereby freed jobs for unemployed men.Stibbe, p. 41. By 1937, full employment had been achieved and women workers were needed, so the requirement was removed and the loan made available to all young people of documented Aryan ancestry and genetic fitness.Grunberger, p. 255.Ruhl, p. 75.Stibbe, p. 87. This caused an increase in applications: by 1936 approximately one third of couples were receiving them; by 1939 this had risen to 42%.Stibbe, p. 44. In July 1938, a special marriage loan programme for agricultural workers was added as part of the Decree on the Welfare of the Rural Population: couples were eligible if one partner had worked in agriculture or forestry for five years before they married, and the loan would be excused after a further ten years of such work. There was also a renewable 400 RM subsidy to farm workers for setting up a household.Schoenbaum, p. 171. Applying for the loans required demonstrating ancestral and medical \\"fitness,\\" which could be onerous.Stibbe, p. 54. However, a law of August 31, 1939 suspended the documentary requirements in anticipation of the effects of the war.Stibbe, p. 155. Couples who were both employed had to pay back the loan at the rate of 3% per month; if only the husband was employed, the repayment rate was 1% a month. In accordance with the Nazi policy of reversing the decline in the birth rate among Germans, one quarter of the loan was forgiven for each child, so that with the fourth child, no more was owed.Ruhl, pp. 62-64. This gave rise to the colloquialism abkindern (from ab, off, and Kind, child) for discharging the loan by producing offspring.Christian Zentner and Friedemann Bed√ºrftig, tr. Amy Hackett, The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, New York: Macmillan, 1991, ; repr. New York: Da Capo, 1997, , pp. 1, 718. By the end of 1938, 1,121,000 marriage loans had been extended, 800,000 under the original conditions of requiring the bride to stop work, and a \\"baby boom\\" had resulted in the forgiveness of 980,000.Grunberger, pp. 235, 254. The loan was then halved, to 500 RM. The 250 RM for each child remained a powerful incentive; other financial assistance, called Kindergeld, was also available to encourage families to have children. The loans were a particularly strong incentive to marry after extramarital pregnancy had occurred. The loans were partially paid for by a tax on unmarried people called Ehestandshilfe (marriage assistance, fund for the aid of marriage).Zentner and Bed√ºrftig, p. 574.Shepard Bancroft Clough, Thomas Moodie and Carol Moodie, eds., Economic History of Europe: Twentieth Century, Documentary history of Western civilization, New York: Harper & Row, 1968, , p. 254. This was levied at a rate of 2-5% of gross annual income on those under 55 who were liable for income tax; under a law of October 16, 1934, it was incorporated into the income tax beginning in January 1935.Schmitz-Berning, p. 122.Friedrich Hartmannsgruber, Die Regierung Hitler volume 3 1936, Munich: Oldenbourg, 2002, , p. 17 As a result of the marriage loan programme, furniture and home furnishings were amongst the few retail trade sectors to show expansion under the Third Reich; and this did not apply to department stores, which were specifically excluded.Schoenbaum, pp. 134, 143 and note 118. The East German government forgave all outstanding marriage loans in 1950, and in 1972 instituted its own loan programme, the Ehekredit (marriage credit), which was strongly reminiscent of the Nazi marriage loan: newlyweds under 26 received an interest-free loan of 5,000 East German marks, which was progressively forgiven as they had children (in this case 3), again referred to as abkindern.Heike Trappe, Emanzipation oder Zwang?: Frauen in der DDR zwischen Beruf, Familie und Sozialpolitik, Berlin: Akademie, 1995, , p. 70 Michael Schwartz, \\"Emanzipation zur sozialen N√ºtzlichkeit: Bedingungen und Grenzen von Frauenpolitik in der DDR\\" in Sozialstaatlichkeit in der DDR: Sozialpolitische Entwicklungen im Spannungsfeld von Diktatur und Gesellschaft 1945/49-1989, ed.

The development of Danish sculpture was greatly influenced in the mid-18th century by the French sculptor Jacques Saly (1717‚Äì1776), who was invited by the Danish government in 1752 to create a statue of King Frederik V. Shortly after the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts was founded in March 1754, Saly was appointed as its director, exerting considerable influence on the workings of the institution. After preparing a number of miniature and full-sized models, Saly finally completed his equestrian statue in 1768 as a bronze casting in the Neoclassical style but it was not unveiled in the courtyard at Amalienborg Palace until August 1771, five years after the king‚Äôs death in 1766.Bent S√∏rensen, \\"Saly, Jacques Fran√ßois Joseph\\", Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbachs kunstnerleksikon.

Early Neoclassicisism Johannes Wiedewelt:Frederik V's sarcophagus (1769) in Roskilde Cathedral Johannes Wiedewelt (1731‚Äì1802) was one of the primary figures responsible for introducing Neoclassicism to Denmark, inspired by stays in Paris and Rome which were facilitated by travel stipends from the newly established Academy. Soon after his return to Denmark in 1758, he was commissioned to sculpt a memorial monument to the long deceased King Christian VI by his widowed wife, Sophie Magdalene. Completed in 1768, the marble monument was not installed in Roskilde Cathedral until 1777. The sarcophagus with two female figures, \\"Sorgen\\" (\\"Sorrow\\") and \\"Ber√∏mmelsen\\" (\\"Fame\\") is considered to be Denmark's first Neoclassical work. Wiedewelt went on to design large collections of sculptures for gardens such as those at Fredensborg Palace. In 1769, he completed the monument to King Frederik V in Roskilde Cathedral which includes a large sarcophagus resting on footpieces and decorated by numerous sculptures, behind which is a column topped by an urn, a medallion with the king's portrait, and on each side of the sarcophagus, reaching some nine feet above the floor, are two crowned, grieving female figures representing Denmark and Norway. The memorial chapel was the result of collaboration between Wiedewelt and the architect Caspar Frederik Harsdorff. Wiedewelt was chosen for eight annual periods as Director of the Academy between 1772 and 1794. As a professor there, he introduced his Neoclassical theories to his students including the painter and architect Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard who later became Director of the Academy and Bertel Thorvaldsen's instructor.Hakon Lund, \\"Wiedewelt, Johannes\\", Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbachs kunstnerleksikon.

Thorvaldsen The Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen Bertel Thorvaldsen: Christus (1824), Church of Our Lady, Copenhagen Bertel Thorvaldsen (1770‚Äì1844) is the most famous Danish sculptor, recognised across Europe as one of the leading Neoclassical sculptors. After entering the Art Academy in Copenhagen when he was only 11, he went on to win all four of the institution's medals. In 1796, he received a stipend for a relatively short study tour to Italy but, apart from a short visit to Denmark in 1819, he stayed in Rome for over 40 years. After a model for his statue of Jason and the Golden Fleece received recognition from the leading Italian sculptor of the day, Antonio Canova, his success was ensured. Thorvaldsen gradually employed numerous assistants, extending his work to be executed in five studios in Rome, as he received orders from all over Europe.\\"About Bertel Thorvaldsen\\" , Thorvaldsen Museum. Retrieved 9 January 2012. Among his most important works are the colossal series of statues of Christ and the twelve Apostles for the rebuilding of Vor Frue Kirke in Copenhagen. Motifs for his works (reliefs, statues, and busts) were drawn mostly from Greek mythology with statues of Venus, Mercury, Ganymede, Hebe, and Cupid and Psyche, but he also created portraits of important personalities, as in his tomb monument for Pope Pius VII in St Peter's Basilica, Rome or the equestrian statue of Jozef Poniatowski in Warsaw. His works can be seen in many European countries, but there is a very large collection at the Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen. During his stay in Rome, Thorvaldsen played an important role in encouraging young Danish artists spending time in the city.\\"Bertel Thorvaldsen\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 9 January 2012. Thorvaldsen's students Three of those who had studied under Thorvaldsen in Rome made significant contributions to the development of Danish sculpture, influenced on the one hand by their master's interest in classicism and on the other by a growing interest in nationalism in their mother country. Hermann Ernst Freund (1786‚Äì1840), who had been Thorvaldsen's closest assistant in Rome, was an early proponent of Danish romantic nationalism, creating 12 statuettes of figures from Nordic mythology, notably Loki (1822), Odin (bronze 1827) and Thor (1829), all inspired by ancient Greek and Roman mythological works.\\"H.E. Freund\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 11 January 2012.

Herman Wilhelm Bissen (1798‚Äì1868), initially a Neoclassicist, is remembered for the Realism of his monumental works celebrating Danish military victories while reflecting the nationalistic trend of the times. Bissen's Landsoldaten or Danish Soldier (1858) in Fredericia and Isted Lion (1862) in Flensburg were both erected to commemorate the Danish victory over Schleswig-Holstein at the Battle of Isted (Idstedt) on 25 July 1850. The Danish Soldier is notable in that it does not depict a high-ranking officer but rather a simple footsoldier with whom Danish citizens could readily identify.\\"Dansk skulptur i nationalistisk perspektiv\\" , Skulpturstudier: dansk skulptur 1800-1940. Retrieved 11 January 2012. Bissen was inspired to design his massive bronze Isted Lion after studying the Piraeus Lion in Venice where it had been displayed as a prize of war since 1687.

Jens Adolf Jerichau (1816‚Äì1883) initially followed closely in Thorvaldsen's footsteps with his Neoclassical work Hercules and Hebe (1846) and his colossal figure of Christ from 1849. He then went on to develop his own, more dynamic style which can be seen in The Panther Hunter (1846), a work which has been seen as a prime example of the relationship between classical art and modern trends in naturalism.\\"Antikken l√¶nge leve: 1800-tallet\\" , Skulpturstudier: dansk skulptur 1800-1940.

A palace was located inside the city just north of city center with sacrificial sites and living quarters nearby. Cemeteries located outside the city to the southeast are divided by the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway into Sectors I and II. Sector I, from the Shang Dynasty, is smaller in size and contains remnants of human and dog sacrifice. Sector II, possibly from the Zhou Dynasty, contains greater numbers of large- and medium-sized tombs of nobles with chariots and rich set of burial items. In all, 200 tombs have been found, with the largest containing 42 sacrificed horses. Several thousand ceramic, ivory, jade, bone, lacquer and bronze artifacts including bronze ceremonial vessels and weapons have been found at the Liulihe Site. The most historically-significant discovery at Liulihe is M1193, the tomb of the Marquis of Yan, which yielded two inscribed bronzes. These two bronzes memorialize exchanges between Yan, the vassal state, and the Kings of the Zhou Dynasty. The inscriptions on the bronzes describe investiture ceremony and the enfeoffment of the vassal State of Yan to the Duke of Shao. The inscriptions corroborate the Records of the Grand Historian, which states that when King Wu of Zhou defeated the Shang Dynasty and founded the Zhou Dynasty in 1045 B.C., he conferred titles of nobility to vassal rulers in his domain. Among those receiving titles were the rulers of the States of Ji and Yan, two states located in modern-day Beijing Municipality. The capital of Yan at Liulihe has been established with considerable certainty through archaeological evidence at Liulihe. The capital of Ji, is believed to be located further north, near modern-day Guang'anmen in Xicheng District. The artifacts unearthed at Liulihe demonstrate the Yan capital's wealth and political importance during the Western Zhou Dynasty dating back to at least the 11th century B.C. During the subsequent Eastern around in the 7th century B.C., the state of Yan conquered the State of Ji to the north and moved its capital from Liulihe to Ji, which became the urban center of Beijing for the next 2,000 years until the 13th century, when the city centre shifted further north during the Yuan Dynasty. The ancient city at Liulihe was discovered in 1962. Four major archaeological excavation were undertaken from 1972 to the early 1990s.

This school represents, according to some authors, a step in overcoming the contradictions of legal positivismIt is a school that has, since the end of the 19th century, characterized the law as a dogmatic institution, or man's imposition over man, in opposition to the former school, legal naturalism, that treated law as a result of metaphysical-rationalist and scientific sources (natural consequence of the other sciences' conclusions and even work of God). The image of legal positivism nonetheless has deteriorated because of being used to favor class oppression. and, for this reason, it has been considered by some authors as a post-positivism school. Jurisprudence of values is referred to in various works all over the world. This modus of thinking of focuses on constitutional principles.The principle, as opposed to the legal rule, is more subjective, and the traditional interpretation gave it minor importance. Jurisprudence of values focuses on achieving the ideals underlying these legal principles. The jurisprudence of values centers on the concepts of incidence and interpretation of the legal norm, as well as rules and principles, and concepts like equality, freedom, and justice.  Juridical norms  According to Pontes de Miranda,Pontes de Miranda, 1973:3 \\"The juridical rule is the norm with which the man, willing to subordinate the events to an order and foreseeability, tries to distribute the life's goods\\". Mankind seeks to somehow control the facts; the juridical norm is used as a tool to decide what is right and wrong. The norm, according to this school, is seen as a creation of man, thus man is controlling man. Pontes de Miranda explains the concept of fact support. Fact support is the fact that is previewed by the norm; it is the abstract fact; it is the fact that, if it is verified true in the world of facts the norm will fall upon it. In other words, there is a world of concrete facts and there is another world of ideas or types. Thus, the legislator tries to use words to group possible concrete facts into sets, related to the world of ideas. This paradigm makes possible to attribute judicial effects to life's facts.

It is generally regarded as a reformation of parts of the military wing of the United Front (Northern Alliance) which with U.S. air support removed the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in late 2001. The National Front strongly opposes a return of the Taliban to power and retains significant military capabilities. The chairman of the National Front is Ahmad Zia Massoud, the younger brother of the Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud who was assassinated two days before the September 11 attacks in 2001. 2001 After the Taliban were removed from power by United Front ground forces and NATO special forces in late 2001, the Shura-e Nazar which more or less had already been replaced by the United Front, dissolved as an organization. Many of its members are still connected and organised within this political party (The National Coalition of Afghanistan). Berlin Statement In January 2012, the National Front raised concerns about the possibility of a secretive and untransparent deal between the US, Pakistan and the Taliban during a widely publicized meeting in Berlin. U.S. Congressman Louie Gohmert wrote, \\"These leaders who fought with embedded Special Forces to initially defeat the Taliban represent over 60-percent of the Afghan people, yet are being entirely disregarded by the Obama and Karzai Administrations in negotiations.\\" Ahmad Zia Massoud from the Tajik-dominated Jamiat-i Islami, Abdul Rashid Dostum, leader of the Uzbek-dominated Junbish-i Milli; Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq, a leader of the Hazara Hezb-e Wahdat and Amrullah Saleh, former director of the Afghan intelligence service NDS and leader of the newly formed Basij-e Milli (Afghanistan Green Trend) encompassing all ethnic groups, after the meeting with US congressmen in Berlin signed a joint declaration: The Asia Times writes: > This is the first time that the leadership of the Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara > communities [of Afghanistan] has come to a common line of thinking ... In > essence, the Northern Alliance is being resuscitated as a political entity. > ... As the Northern Alliance groups see it, Pakistani strategy is to wait > out the period between now and 2014 - the date set for the US troop > withdrawal - and then regroup the Taliban and make a bid to capture power in > Kabul. Their strong show of unity in Berlin suggests that they will not roll > over and give way to an exclusive US-Taliban-Pakistan settlement being > imposed on their nation. Countrywide political rallies Besides incorporating the political parties of the involved leaders, the National Front works in coordination with different Afghan political parties. Among the major political parties that support or work in coordination with the National Front are the National Coalition of Afghanistan led by Abdullah Abdullah, the Basej-e Milli led by Amrullah Saleh, the Nangarhar Shura led by a Pashtun leadership council, the National Congress Party of Afghanistan led by Latif Pedram, and the main Jamiat-e Islami led by Balkh governor Ustad Atta Mohammad Noor. The National Front has held major political rallies across different provinces in Afghanistan. These rallies were attended by thousands of Afghan citizens. Abdul Rashid Dostum speaking on one of these rallies said that the Taliban were establishing bases in the north of Afghanistan from which to mount attacks after the withdrawal of most international troops in 2014. The National Front announced it would have a candidate running for the presidential elections in 2014 and emphasized the need for \\"a transparent and fair election\\".

Career =Siemens= Heins spent 23 years working at Siemens. He served in several positions related to wireless technology including the chief technology officer of Siemens' communications division and several general management roles in hardware and software. =BlackBerry= Heins joined Research In Motion (now BlackBerry) in 2007. He rose through the ranks starting as senior vice president of BlackBerry's handheld unit; chief operating officer for product engineering, and finally chief operating officer for product and sales in July 2011. In January 2012, Heins was named to succeed co-founders Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis as president and CEO. During his time as CEO, the company continued to struggle in a rapidly changing market. Heins was responsible for BlackBerry's development of the BlackBerry 10 line of consumer and enterprise devices. In 2012, Heins was named Cantech Letter's 2012 TSX Executive of the Year and ranked a year later as third on a list of the worst CEOs of 2013. Heins was replaced by John Chen, a veteran Silicon Valley executive, during a November 2013 management shakeup and left the company with a $13.8 million severance. Prem Watsa, the board member who recruited John Chen said, \\"Thorsten did a very good job given the hand that he was dealt, but resigned because you can‚Äôt have two people being in charge.

During Heins' tenure Powermat secured an agreement from Samsung to incorporate its wireless charging technology into future smartphones. Heins found himself in the middle of a battle between two factions on Powermat's board. Since October 2015, he and some board members were the target of a lawsuit by other Powermat board members led by founder Ran Poliakane for allegedly running the company without an approved budget. Investors like Goldman Sachs and Hudson Clean Energy backed Heins. Heins and other board members, constituting a majority of the directors, countersued. Heins resigned from Powermat in July 2016. Heins' resignation helped settle the lawsuits just mentioned and allowed for new investment from several important shareholders. Heins had earlier threatened to leave due to what he called a hostile work environment. Public service As of 2012, Heins served on the board of the German Canadian Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Toronto. As of 2016, Heins serves on the University of Waterloo's board of governors.

It is also called N√©el-Arrhenius theory, after the Arrhenius equation, and N√©el-Brown theory after a more rigorous derivation by William Fuller Brown, Jr. N√©el used his theory to develop a model of thermoremanent magnetization in single-domain ferromagnetic minerals that explained how these minerals could reliably record the geomagnetic field. He also modeled frequency-dependent susceptibility and alternating field demagnetization. Superparamagnetism Superparamagnetism occurs in ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic nanoparticles which are single- domain, i.e. composed of a single magnetic domain. This is possible when their diameter is below 3‚Äì50 nm, depending on the materials. In this condition, it is considered that the magnetization of the nanoparticles is a single giant magnetic moment, sum of all the individual magnetic moments carried by the atoms of the nanoparticle. This is what people are working on in the subfield of superparamagnetism call ‚Äúmacro-spin approximation‚Äù. Mean transition time Because of the nanoparticle‚Äôs magnetic anisotropy, the magnetic moment has usually only two stable orientations antiparallel to each other, separated by an energy barrier. The stable orientations define the magnetic easy axis of the nanoparticle. At finite temperature, there is a finite probability for the magnetization to flip and reverse its direction. The mean time between two flips is called the N√©el relaxation time and is given by the N√©el-Arrhenius equation: :\\\\tau_\\\\text{N} = \\\\tau_0 \\\\exp \\\\left(\\\\frac{K V}{k_\\\\text{B} T}\\\\right), where is the height of the energy barrier, a product of the magnetic anisotropy energy density and volume ; is the Boltzmann constant, the temperature and their product the thermal energy; and is a length of time, characteristic of the material, called the attempt time or attempt period (its reciprocal is called the attempt frequency). Typical values for are between 10‚àí9 and 10‚àí10 seconds. The N√©el relaxation time can be anywhere from a few nanoseconds to years or much longer. In particular, it is an exponential function of the grain volume, which explains why the flipping probability becomes rapidly negligible for bulk materials or large nanoparticles.  Blocking temperature  Suppose that the magnetization of a single superparamagnetic nanoparticle is measured over a time . If this time is much greater than the relaxation time , the nanoparticle magnetization will flip several times during the measurement. In zero field, the measured magnetization will average to zero. If , the magnetization will not flip during the measurement, so the measured magnetization will be equal to the initial magnetization. In the former case, the nanoparticle will appear to be in the superparamagnetic state whereas in the latter case it will be blocked in its initial state. The state of the nanoparticle (superparamagnetic or blocked) depends on the measurement time. A transition between superparamagnetism and the blocked state occurs when . In several experiments, the measurement time is kept constant but the temperature is varied, so the transition between superparamagnetism and blocked state is a function of the temperature. The temperature for which is called the blocking temperature: :T_\\\\text{B} = \\\\frac{K V}{k_\\\\text{B} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\tau_\\\\text{m}/\\\\tau_0\\\\right)} For typical laboratory measurements, the value of the logarithm in the previous equation is in the order of 20‚Äì25.

The practice/theory is based on universal patterns of nature and of man as part of a universal design/order and was named by Laban: Space Harmony or Choreutics. Laban, who laid the foundation for Laban Movement Analysis, was interested in the series of natural sequences of movements that we follow in our various everyday activity.Laban, Rudolf. Choreutics (1966, 2011). Dance Books Ltd. Being a dancer/choreographer, he saw the everyday patterns of human action and abstracted the essence of these into the ‚Äúart of movement‚Äù. He saw spatial patterns in human movement and recognized the shapes of the Platonic Solids within these patterns. He applied the ideal patterns of the Platonic Solids as forms to the actualized movement of humans ‚Äì aligning with and closely approximating the space of these forms. Linking the directions of the vertices of a shape, following the natural spatial pulls to move along all directions within this shape, he came to specific movement Scales: patterned movement sequences that can be repeated, in which one moves through a Platonic Solid in a predefined way. Moving these Scales opens up the body in space, enlarges spatial awareness and at the same time balances the body spatially. This is why his space theory is called Space Harmony. Rudolf Laban showing direction symbols  History  See Rudolf Laban  Related terms  = General space = General space is the space in which we move. It is the actual space or environment, like the room we are in or the street. = Kinesphere = The personal space or Kinesphere is the space around us within reaching possibilities of the limbs without changing one's place.Dell, Cecily. Space Harmony (1966, 1977). New York: Dance Notation Bureau, Inc. We can use a large area around us (Far Reach Kinesphere) when we use big movements, especially with our limbs. Or we can use a small area (Near Reach Kinesphere) when we move only within near reach of ourselves. In between is called Mid Reach Kinesphere. = Levels = Laban believed there were three 'types' of dancers (or movers generally). Those who enjoy moving in the High Level, such as leaping and springing off the ground. Those who enjoy moving in the Central (Middle) Level, their bodies leading with more sensuous movement. And those who enjoy moving in the Deep (Low) Level [...], who prefer more earth-bound movements.Newlove & Dalby. Laban for all (2004, 2009). London: Nick Hern Books Limited = Pathways = A Pathway refers to the path that is being followed by the movement from one point in space to another. Within the Kinesphere, different approaches to the Pathways of the movement are defined: * Central Pathway - Movement which is initiated from or passes through the center of the body. * Peripheral Pathway - Movement along the outer limits of the Kinesphere. * Transverse Pathway - Movement passing between the center of the body and the periphery of the Kinesphere. = Directions = Laban's 26 Direction Symbols Laban has found a system to define the directions we can move in. This system includes 3 different levels as well as one-, two- and three-dimensional directions. The 26 directions that are in the system, are derived from the vertices of the Octahedron, the Icosahedron and the Cube. Laban has created symbols for all the directions that he defined in this system. These symbols can be used as a notation system, like in Labanotation, to describe where a person is moving (to) in space. Although often is being spoken of 'moving to a point in space', Laban explicitly did not see movement as 'moving from point to point', or change from position to position. \\"Over... ten years [1917-1927], the problem he tried to solve was how to write motion, not only positions passed through, a task which proved to be extraordinarily difficult. All his various solutions up until 1927 - and there are many recorded in Laban's book Choreographie Rudolf Laban. Chorographie (1926), translated by Evamaria Zierach and Jeffrey Scott Longstaff \\\\- retain this hope.\\"Preston-Dunlop & Lahusen. Schrifttanz, a view of German dance in the Weimar Republic (1990). London: Dance Books In his book Choreutics (1966) he writes: \\"The future development of kinetography must include the possibility of recording forms in free space ... the conception of a notation capable of doing this is an old dream in this field of research.\\" = Inclinations = One of the unique aspects of Laban's conception of space has become known as Inclinations. An inclination is conceived to be either \\"a diagonal deflected through a close-by dimensional, or alternatively, a dimensional deflected through one of the closest diagonals\\" and since these two conceptions are essentially identical, Laban related the inclinations to the three dimensions as they are more familiar.Laban, Rudolf. Choreographie (German) (1926). Jena: Eugen Diederichs. Therefore, three types of inclinations are distinguished:Bartenieff, I., Lewis, D. Body movement - Coping with the environment (1980, 2002). New York: Routledge. * Flat inclinations are diagonals deflected by the side-side dimension (horizontal or lateral). * Steep inclinations are diagonals deflected by the up-down dimension (vertical). * Suspended inclinations are diagonals deflected by the front-back dimension (sagittal).  Dynamics in space  = One-dimensional space = Three dimensions in an octahedral scaffolding The Dimensions are defined as single spatial pulls with two polar ends.Bradley, Karen K. Rudolf Laban (2009). New York: Routledge. They are the 3 perpendicular axes crossing in the middle. The 3 different Dimensions are: * Vertical Dimension (up-down) * Horizontal Dimension (side-side) * Sagittal Dimension (front-back) The crossing point is in the center of gravity of the body (Place Middle). The Platonic solid that is defined by the dimensional cross is the Octahedron. Laban devised movement scales that follow these three dimensions, called the Dimensional Scales. = Two dimensional space = Icosahedron with planes Two spatial pulls combined, produce planes in space as well as in the body. The combination of the horizontal and vertical dimensions result in what is called the vertical, or door plane. This plane is also called the plane of presentation. The combination of the horizontal and the sagittal dimensions result in the horizontal, or table plane. It is also known as the plane of communication. The third plane is the combination of the vertical and the sagittal dimensions and is called the sagittal, or wheel plane. It is also called the plane of operations. The Diameters are the lines that connect the opposite corners of the planes. Each plane has 2 diameters, crossing in the middle. The diameters of the planes each consist of 2 unequal spatial pulls. When putting the planes together, all diameters cross again in the center of gravity of the body. Connecting the corners of the planes with each other leads to the Icosahedron. Laban thought of many ways to order the movements through the Icosahedron, each with its own character and dynamics. Examples of these scales are: Primary Scale, Axis Scales, Girdle Scales, A and B Scales. = Three- dimensional space = Four diagonals in a cubic scaffolding Combinations of three dimensions, or spatial pulls, become diagonals; extremes of far reach space that crisscross the body's center from one corner of an imaginary Cube to the opposite corner. Laban devised the Diagonal Scale to explore these extremes of personal space. An animated stickfigure executing the Diagonal Scales, one of the Scales that are part of Space Harmony of Laban Movement Analysis Scales animated: To watch animations of the scales, go to Laban Scales  Scales  Analogous to a Musical scale, each choreutic scale (or space harmony scale) systematically encompasses particular ranges of space. Choreutic scales can also be compared to mathematical puzzles such as Leonhard Euler and his problem of the Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg, as well as William Rowan Hamilton and his Icosian game. Choreutic scales present symmetric solutions to these types of puzzles accomplished within the movement space of the human body. Most Choreutic scales follow regular sequential patterns, similar to these puzzles: * They form a complete ring (circuit), ending at the same place where they began. * They consist of a series of lines, all of the same type (for example, all transverse or all peripheral) or of regular repetitions (one central line followed by one peripheral line, etc.). * When the scale is related to a polyhedron, they might use every vertex once, and only once, or use every edge (line) once and only once, before completing the circuit. * They are structured with three-dimensional symmetry (rotational symmetry and reflection symmetry). = Scales in the icosahedron = Laban developed many scales within the Icosahedron, some of them with Transverse Movement, like the Axis and A- and B-Scales, others with Peripheral Movement, like the Girdle and Primary Scales. In the scales with Transverse Movement, one moves from a Direction in one plane through the second plane towards a Direction in the third plane, following the natural Spatial Pull of the missing Dimension. E.g.: when one starts a movement scale in the Right High Direction, one is in the Vertical Plane. This plane exists of the combination of the Vertical Dimension and the Horizontal Dimension. When reaching to the Right High Direction, the natural way to balance the body is to move towards the 'missing' Sagittal Dimension, so in this case going forward or backward. To accomplish the task of going from the one plane (in this case Vertical) through another plane towards the third, one can only cross the Horizontal Plane and thus move towards either the Front Low or the Back Low Direction in the Sagittal Plane. Note that the pathway of the movement in this example is a Transverse Pathway, because it passes between the center of the body and the periphery of the Kinesphere. Movements that follow the specific definition as described above, Laban called Transversals. So although moving from the one plane to the other, planes being two dimensional, one moves through all planes and thus through all dimensions during the scale as a whole, following an organic body-organization to stay balanced. Especially the sensation of being led by and leading oneself through all these different spatial directions, adding dimensions and leaving them out again, can give the feeling one flies through space, being pulled back and taking off again. = Trefoil knot= Blue Trefoil Knot The patterns of many scales can be found to be based on the Trefoil knot.

A separate entity, one could say. He strongly disagrees with several core ideas: that atheists are immoral people; that any society will become like Lord of the Flies if it becomes too secular; that without morality being laid out in front of us, like a commandment, we have no reason to be moral; that absolute moral standards require the existence of a God.

The complex consists of 16 rustic structures built from 1893 to about 1950. Since 1999 it has been managed by the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. History Crawford Livingston Jr. was born in 1848 to a prominent New York family. In 1870 he came to St. Paul and became involved in railroad, gas, electric and lumber ventures. In 1875 he married Mary Steele Potts With and they had daughter Mary Steele Livingston the following year. In 1884 the Northern Wisconsin Lumber Company bought the land that would become Forest Lodge, and by 1888 the company had built a logging camp there, on the south side of a bay of Lake Namekagon. Soon the timber was cut and in 1889 Crawford Livingston and some hunters and fishermen from Chicago leased the land around the camp as a hunting retreat. It is said that a blacksmith shop, bunkhouse, cookhouse and other log buildings were still present from the logging camp. The first new construction was probably a cabin in 1893. With the decline of logging, people realized the potential of the area around Lake Namekagon for recreation. In 1890 and 1891 two homes were constructed on Champaign Island, and in 1890 a home on Anderson Island. The area was connected by rail to Minneapolis and St. Paul and became a vacation destination. By 1911 six resorts were operating on the lake. Meanwhile, the focus of Livingston's camp shifted from a men's hunting camp to a family retreat. In 1902 Livingston assumed full ownership of 100 acres including the camp. Substantial remodelings in the 1910s, 1920s and 1930s expanded the retreat's size. Many of the additions came after 1927 when Crawford's daughter Mary and her husband Theodore Griggs owned Forest Lodge. Some came later after their daughter, Mary Griggs Burke, inherited it in 1943. The 1893 cabin was expanded or rebuilt into the main lodge in 1914-1915, then remodeled in 1928-29. The result is a rustic-styled log building on a stone foundation with full logs joined by saddle notches. Its roof is covered with wood shakes, pierced by four stone chimneys. An open porch spans the front. In the 1930s Edwin Lundie designed some improvements to the lodge. Inside are a dining room, living room, kitchen, maid's dining room, three bedrooms, library, sitting room, and three bathrooms. Decoration is simple - largely logs, wood paneling, and wood floors. The maid's cabin was built 1911-1912 and rebuilt in 1929. It is built into the hillside, one story, with walls of vertical logs and a hipped roof. Inside are five bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room, kitchen and laundry room. The 2-story guest house was designed by Magnus Jemne and built 1928-29. Inside is a 24x34 foot \\"old English great room\\" with a vaulted ceiling and a kitchen with a dumbwaiter to deliver food to the great room. The \\"Cow Palace\\" was built in 1929 and expanded in 1940. It served as garage, stable, and living quarters for chauffers, gardeners, and the dairyman's family. Like other buildings, the walls are vertical logs on a stone foundation. The footprint is an 'H'. Milk and cream were processed right in the building and the Forest Lodge Dairy supplied the lodge until 1961. The complex also includes a pumphouse/storage cabin built in 1912, a 1920 garage, a 1922 playhouse which was a gift for Mary Griggs Burke from her parents, a 1923 stonehouse/storage building, a gatehouse built 1928-29, a large wet boathouse built the same year, an icehouse built in 1940 and restored in 1999. It also includes a 1929 tennis court, a greenhouse and gardens built in the 1930s, a storm shelter/root cellar built in the 1930s, a steamer/fire engine shed, and various paths and walls built throughout the life of the complex. In 1999 an archaeological survey discovered Native American artifacts on the grounds. In that same year, Mary Griggs Burke donated her 872-acre estate to the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, requiring that it be used to \\"provide environmental research and educational programs.\\" Since then, they have partnered with Northland College to deliver those goals. Tours of the estate can be arranged through Northland.

The first (2011) & second (2014) series were broadcast on RT√â One. Season One Season One was filmed around Ireland in 2011 and aired later that year. The first season had four episodes, each filmed at beautiful historical Irish locations, Slane Castle, Glenlo Abbey, Adare Manor & Carton House. The series was presented by Derek Mooney and he was joined by a leading team of genealogists & historians; Turtle Bunbury (historian), Nicola Morris (genealogist) and John Grenham (genealogist). The team traveled the country with the roadshow meeting members of the public and helping them trace their family's roots and discover surprising stories from the past. Series one featured extraordinary stories; The Collins family from Boston were reunited with long lost relations in Co Galway, the experts helped Paul Duffy from Co Meath trace the owner of a mysterious 1858 passport and they even found evidence of a link between Glenn Webb from Dublin and the Arctic explorer Ernest Shackleton. Season Two The Second Season returned to RT√â One on Sunday 11 May 2014. Derek Mooney returned to present and he was joined by historian Turtle Bunbury and professional genealogists John Grenham and Susan Chadwick. In each episode, Turtle, John and Susan met members of the public at the roadshows and helped them look into their family histories & mysteries. Unearthing the truth behind family stories and solving age old family questions. In series two the experts helped a Dundalk man finds his links to St. Oliver Plunkett, A Cork man discovers that his relatives were saved from the gallows by none other than Daniel O‚ÄôConnell in a famous trial and looked into how a Wexford man was spared a terrible fate at Custer's Last Stand, only to be forgotten by history, until now. The second series was filmed at Powerscourt in Co Wicklow, University College Cork and Lumen Christi College, Derry. Format The format is somewhat similar to Antiques Roadshow. Each episode is set in a particular city and usually deals with people from that city and the surrounding area. There are several segments per episode. An individual, or family, looking to know more about their heritage arrives with a specific question about someone they might be related to or the reported exploits of an ancestor. The Roadshow genealogists have a sit down meeting with the guests and, using video monitors and tablet computers, reveal to them their findings. The segments usually contain a short video clip explaining more about the time period which the segment focuses on. Interspersed with these longer segments are short, informal, meetings between the genealogists and a guest, revealing information about their ancestry. It is \\"exactly like Antiques Roadshow except that it deals in dead people rather than mouldy artefacts\\", according to the Irish Independents John Bolans.

It ranges the Cantabrian Mountains in northern Spain, with a population of 17,000 animals in 2007-2008. Taxonomic classification The systematic of the species is still under discussion. √Ångel Cabrera (1914), on studying the body shape and skull morphology, considered this taxa so similar to the Pyrenean chamois as to be of the same species. Lovari (1987), using morphology, genetic and ethology data proposed to separate the south-west European animals of the Cantabrian Mountains and Pyrenees (Rupicapra pyrenaica parva, R.p. pyrenaica), from the rest of the European and Asian animals (Rupicapra r. cartusiana -Chartreuse Mountains-, Rupicapra r. rupicapra -Alps-, Rupicapra r. tatrica -Tatra Mountains-, Rupicapra r. carpatica -Romania-, Rupicapra r. balcanica -Balkans-, Rupicapra r. asiatica -Turkey- y Rupicapra r. caucasica -Caucasus Mountains).

Identification The Cantabrian chamois is a slim bovid the size of a domestic goat. Both sexes have peculiar hooked horns (more hooked and thicker in males than in females, Figures 1,2,3). Figure 1: Identification of sex and winter and summer coats in Cantabrian chamois. Figure 2: Male Cantabrian chamois in winter coat (left: in its second year of age; right: adult). The horns have a transversal segmentation pattern due to seasonal growth (winter- summer). The head, throat and cheeks are a light cinnamon colour with a dark mask design that crosses the big eyes (Figure 1). The back, chest, legs and flanks are dark brown, while the shoulders and hindquarters are pale brown. In winter, the back and belly become paler in colour and the flanks darker, giving a more contrasting colour pattern (Figure 4). Juveniles exhibit a less contrasting colour pattern.

Distribution Figure 5: Distribution of Cantabrian chamois in 2008. Dots are records of the presence of the species during the ninetieth century. Cantabrian Mountains (North West, Spain). From East Saja Reserve and Alto As√≥n (Cantabria) to West Ancares Reserve (Lugo, Galicia), (Figure 5). Species distribution shrank in historical time. The Cantabrian Mountains are situated in the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula, running 450 km East-West, parallel to the Cantabrian Sea and very close to the coastline (max. altitude 2648 m.a.s.l.). The north catchment is very wet (2000 mm/year) and the south catchment has a continental climate, dry and hot in summer and dry and cold in winter. Habitat Subalpine, preference for the ecotone between forest and alpine meadow, with nearby cliffs as refuge-escape areas. Food Grasses year-round with an increase in the proportion of dwarf shrubs in winter (Calluna vulgaris, Erica cinerea, Erica arborea). Reproduction Only one offspring/year (May‚ÄìJune, first births in the middle of May). Females sexually mature at 3 yr old and fertile until at least at 14 yr old. Behaviour Gregarious. Group size (2-55, median = 6.5). The only stable social unit is mother-offspring that can last until the offspring is 2 yr old. Population size and historic evolution of the population 17400 chamois in 2007-2008 (Figure 6). Historical minimum population size is unknown but it took place between 1943 and 1966. After the last Ice Age, R. pyrenaica occupied most of the Iberian Peninsula. During the Neolithic it was present as far south as the provinces of Teruel, Valencia, J√°en (Segura Mountains) and Granada (600 km south of the present distribution range). It maintained the occupation of the southern range at least until the Bronze Age 5000 yr BC.Alf√©rez, F., Molero, G y Bustos, V. (1981).

Written records indicate that by 1800 the distribution was restricted to the north of the Iberian Peninsula, from the north of Burgos to the Zamora provinces.Balboa, J.A. (1992). El Bierzo en la obra de dos militares del siglo XVIII: Datoli y Munarriz. Tr. Bellavista, Ponferrada. Excessive game hunting, together with the proliferation of long distance rifles, drove the population size to minimum numbers, this happened between 1943 and 1966. The population started to increase with the creation of protected areas (National Game Reserves) and establishing gamekeepers for the first time. Figure 6: Distribution area of the Cantabrian chamois and abundance (chamois/km2) estimated in 2007-2008. Isolated points indicate sporadic observations of roaming chamois. Predators and threats Adults are predated only by wolf. Kids can be predated by wolf, fox and golden eagle. Epizootic diseases, such as sarcoptic mange, are a serious threat. Sarcoptic mange is caused by the Sarcoptes scabies acari, which causes damage and itchiness in the skin of a large number of ungulate species worldwide.Arlian, L.G., Vyszenski-Moher, D.L. & M.J. Pole (1989). Survival of adults and development stages of Sarcoptes scabiei var canis when off the host. Exp. Appl. Acarol. 6(3): 181-187.

In this year an outbreak of mange (originally detected 2 years before, in the south-center of Asturias and north-center of Leon) seriously affected the populations of these areas. Fifteen years after the outbreak (1993-2008) the disease had spread about 40 km east, an average of 2.6 km/yr. In 2009 only the population at the west side of the outbreak focus was free of the disease. The disease may not have spread into the west population due to the very low population densities in the areas that separate the west from the east populations (Figure 7). In 2008, 56% of the whole population and 60% of the distribution range was affected by the disease. The mange is continuing to spread at the current time (2010).P√©rez-Barber√≠a, F.

Reintroductions Although the first reintroduction initiatives started in 1970, reintroduction programs were not successful until the 1980s. These programs have extended the distribution range in the east and west, where very low densities of chamois made the natural recolonization of these areas difficult.

Education and Training Alexander Goudie was born in the Renfrewshire town of Paisley, Scotland in 1933. He studied at the Glasgow School of Art under William Armour, David Donaldson and Benno Schotz and where he was awarded the Somerville Shanks Prize for Composition.Obituary for Alexander Goudie - The Daily Telegraph 27 April 2004 For many years he was a tutor at the school, before dedicating himself to his own studio work. The portraitist As a portraitist his sitters included Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Lord Chancellor Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the comedian and actor Billy Connolly and a host of other figures drawn from the worlds of politics, commerce and entertainment. He was elected a member of the Glasgow Art Club in 1956The Glasgow Art Club - History Page at glasgowartclub.co.uk/ and a member of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters in 1970.Timothy Clifford, Alexander Goudie: Don Quixote of Glasgow artists, The Independent, 18 March 2004 In 1979, was the focus of a three part BBC Television series, entitled 'Portrait' Brittany and the faienceries Although he achieved renown as a portrait painter, Alexander Goudie distinguished himself in a range of other creative spheres. A lifelong association with Brittany resulted from marriage to his Breton wife Marie- Renee. For over 30 years, summers were spent documenting the changing face of the rural landscape in sketchbooks and paintings, on harboursides and in the fields. The culmination of these decades of study came in 1989 with the commission to decorate the interior of the Brittany Ferries flagship, MV Bretagne.Mv Bretagne , in Brittany Ferries Enthusiasts Some years later he was chosen to revive the tradition of creative collaboration between artists and the famous ceramic faienceries of Quimper. The resulting series of ceramic sculptures depicting ‚ÄòBreton types‚Äô, bear testament to a way of life that had all but vanished at the end of the 20th century. Robert Burns' Tam o' Shanter A Scot first and foremost however, Goudie held a fascination throughout his career with Robert Burns' narrative poem, Tam o' Shanter and over many years he re-created the poem in paintings.Alexander Goudie, A Sign of the Tam, Scotsman.com, 22 January 2009 The final illustrative cycle of over 60 works, completed in 1999, would be purchased in its entirety and now resides on permanent public display at Rozelle House, near Burns‚Äô home in Alloway, Ayrshire. Salome Alexander Goudie also found literary inspiration in Oscar Wilde's play Salome and Richard Strauss' opera of the same name. When asked to create the d√©cor for a production by Scottish Opera, the painter immersed himself in both the text and the music. He devised a host of designs for costumes and sets, which were fated not to appear on stage when the project met financial difficulties. Undeterred, Goudie transformed his vision into an exhibition of dramatic canvasses which was unveiled at the Edinburgh Festival in 1990. Influences and legacy Alexander Goudie died in 2004 in Glasgow, Scotland. As draughtsman and colourist, he drew inspiration from a broad range of subjects. In his studio in Glasgow he worked painting portraits of society figures one day and immortalising the labouring Breton peasant the next. In character he was as theatrical as many of the canvasses to which he put his name. He saw himself in the tradition of figurative painting which stretched back from the work of his native Glasgow Boys, to encompass the influence of Paul Gauguin, Goya, Vel√°zquez and Titian. He identified with them in his strongly held belief that ‚Äúthe pictures should tell their own story‚Äù and that an artist should, above all else, ‚Äúspeak with a clear voice‚Äù. His son Lachlan Goudie, born 1976, is following in his father's footsteps as a painter himself as well as writing and presenting the BBC television series The Story of Scottish Art (2015)http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06hbvzn and presenting a BBC documentary celebrating the 150th anniversary of the birth of Charles Rennie Mackintosh (2018).

In 1852, he moved the company to London to be closer to the bonded warehouses of London Docks, then the biggest tea trading port in the world. Until 1826, only loose leaf teas had been sold, allowing unscrupulous traders to increase profits by adding other items such as hedge clippings or dust. Horniman revolutionised the tea trade by using mechanical devices to speed the process of filling pre- sealed packages, thereby reducing his cost of production and hence improving the quality for the end customer. This caused some consternation amongst his competitors, but by 1891 Horniman's was the largest tea trading business in the world. Friedrich Nietzsche once mentioned in private correspondence that it was his favourite tea.http://www.nietzschesource.org/#eKGWB/BVN-1887,870 letter to Franz Overbeck in 1887 In the 1870s, the business was taken over by his son Frederick John Horniman (1835-1906), who subsequently invested much of his fortune for social purposes. An avid collector since childhood, he travelled extensively, and founded and built the Horniman Museum in Forest Hill, South London, to house his various collections. Today the museum houses some 350,000 items, of which the core 10% are from Frederick's original donation. Post World War I, in 1918 Frederick's son Emslie Horniman sold the business to J. Lyons & Co., who moved production to their new factory in Greenford, Middlesex, in July 1921. United States distribution ended in 1993. However, Horniman's Tea remains a popular brand of tea and infusions in Spain, Paraguay and Uruguay.

During his study of film and design, he produced a few short documentaries and fictional films. In his films he often explores subcultures such as underground music genres, and people who exist parallel to or on the edge of society. He seeks to tell common but nevertheless extraordinary stories, and generate unique audiovisual atmospheres. Steineck also works as a graphic artist and illustrator. In his 84-minute feature documentary Truckfighters, he combines creative elements to tell the story about a common Swedish rock band in a most unconventional way. \\"Truckfighters Fuzzomentary\\" attracted media attention due to guest appearances of well known musicians and bands including Josh Homme and Fu Manchu. The release of his music documentary Lo Sound Desert is set for 2012. Trailers for this film are available on the internet since 2006 and have attracted attention of fans of the musical genre 'Desert or Stoner Rock', which is also a main topic in Truckfighters. Steineck started his creative development with drawing, painting and photographing during his childhood. He shot his first film in the age of thirteen with a friend's VHS camera.

He was the editor of Yachting from 1908 until 1952. Early life Herbert Lawrence Stone was born in 1871 in Charleston, South Carolina to William and Mary (Taylor) Stone. His father William was a successful New York attorney, after serving for a short time as the Attorney General for South Carolina. Herbert's paternal grandfather Thomas Treadwell Stone was a prominent New England minister and Transcendentalist. Herbert spent much of his childhood in New York, but spent many summers in Plymouth, Massachusetts learning to sail in Cape Cod bays. After being diagnosed with a lung condition that was expected to significantly shorten his life, Stone went to sea at the age of 17. He made several voyages on the schooner Hattie Weston under the command of Captain Josiah Morton. Stone subsequently went to work as assistant paymaster for the NY Central Railroad. In 1898 Herbert married Redelia Gilchrist in Iowa City, IA, and had two sons, William and James. Career with Yachting Magazine On January 1, 1907, publisher Oswald Garrison Villard released the first issue of Yachting. A year later Villard appointed his \\"schoolmate and lifelong friend\\", 37-year-old Herbert Stone, as the magazine's second editor.Villard, Oswald Garrison, Fighting Years, Harcourt, Brace and Company,1939. Stone continued as the editor through a series of ownership changes, except for a brief two-year period during World War I when he went to war and left William Atkin in charge of Yachting.Yachting, October 2007 - http://www.yachtingmagazine.com/2007/10/the-first-decades-photo- gallery?pnid=120701 In 1920 Herbert Stone, Albert Britt and William A. Miles purchased the magazine from Mr. Villard, and sold it to John Clarke Kennedy a few years later. In 1938 Stone assembled the Yachting Publishing Company, and took on the role of president, publisher, and editor. In the years that followed Herbert wrote many articles for the magazine, both under a variety of pen names as well as his own. Stone also wrote and edited a number of books, including his own ABC of Boat Sailing and America's Cup Races.\\"The Skipper\\", Yachting, November 1955, p. 42-43. Stone served as the editor and guiding spirit of the magazine until his retirement in 1952. He remained as publisher and president of the corporation until his death in 1955. World War I Stone joined the U.S. Navy when World War I started, and was the commanding officer of Submarine Chaser No. 1, sailing out of Hampton Roads and off the Virginia Capes. Later as a lieutenant and navigating officer of the he served on trans-Atlantic troop transport duty. When the war ended Stone and a few friends bought some cargo schooners and formed Mercator Navigation Company, operating in coastal and foreign trade. But that business soon closed as steam was replacing sail on the seas, and the operation of those schooners became economically impracticable. Boating and Racing In 1909 Herbert was one of the organizers of a sailing race around Long Island, NY, and won the Brooklyn Challenge Cup in Waialua the following year. In 1922 Stone helped to organize and became one of the 33 charter members of the Cruising Club of America, and served as its second commodore in 1923.Jones, Gregory O., American Sailboat, MBI Publishing Company, St. Paul, MN, 2002. His influence helped steer that club to a preeminent position in the national and even world yachting picture. Although primarily a sailor, Stone won a race around Long Island in 1916 in the power cruiser \\"Cero\\". In the early 1920s Stone and a few others decided to revive Bermuda racing. By \\"diligent and enthusiastic promotion\\" they convinced 22 yacht owners to take part in the Bermuda Race, an event that started in New London, Connecticut and finished in Bermuda. The race then took on national interest, and had grown to 84 entries in 1954. Stone sailed in the early Bermuda Races, but stopped racing in that event in the 1930s. Herbert L. Stone died on September 27, 1955, and his ashes were scattered in Long Island Sound. The Royal Bermuda Yacht Club flew its flag at half staff on the day of his funeral, the first time in the 111-year history of that club it was done for a non-member. A few months before his death friends of Stone provided a perpetual trophy in his name to go to the first yacht to finish the Bermuda Race Cruiser Division each year it is held. \\"The Skipper\\" did not live to make the first presentation of the Herbert L. Stone Memorial Trophy. Stone was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame on November 9, 2019.

It stars Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Wraysford and Cl√©mence Po√©sy as Isabelle Azaire and was directed by Philip Martin based on a screenplay by Abi Morgan. The adaptation was produced by Working Title Films for the BBC and PBS's Masterpiece. It premiered in January 2012 in the United Kingdom and in April 2012 in the United States. Plot The television adaptation differs from the novel in many respects, completely omitting the section set in the 1970s. The story is told in flashbacks, with Stephen Wraysford's (Eddie Redmayne) experiences in World War I alternating with his memories of his affair with Isabelle Azaire (Cl√©mence Po√©sy), a young married woman whom he met before the war when he was staying in her husband's house to learn about business. Stephen and Isabelle run away together when their affair is discovered by her husband, but she leaves Stephen after a short time. Stephen recalls these events when he is badly wounded as a result of an encounter with German sappers when he and his own men accompany the British tunnellers of the Royal Engineers underground. Left for dead, he is discovered and saved by Jack Firebrace (Joseph Mawle), a working-class man with whom Stephen has previously felt little empathy. In 1916, Stephen is reunited with Isabelle as a result of a chance meeting with her sister Jeanne (Marie-Jos√©e Croze), shortly before his battalion goes \\"over the top\\" in the Battle of the Somme. Upset by the encounter, he takes his fellow-officer, Weir (Richard Madden), to a prostitute, but neither man is able to obtain satisfaction. Weir plays a much smaller role than he does in the novel. During the battle, Stephen is again wounded and loses many of his men; Firebrace and Weir are among the survivors. Two years later, with the war drawing to a close, Stephen's men are preparing another mining expedition. He meets Jeanne, who tells him that Isabelle has died, but he also discovers that he has a seven-year-old daughter, Fran√ßoise (Oc√©ane Bersegeay-Holliday), whose existence Isabelle had concealed from him. He is also disheartened by the death of his friend Weir, shot dead by a sniper. German miners, digging close by, lay a charge and Weir's men are unable to get out of the tunnel in time. Stephen and Firebrace are the only ones left alive, but their way out is blocked. They talk and share their experiences, Firebrace grieving for his dead son while Stephen confides in him that he has a daughter. (In the novel, Stephen is unaware of the child's existence at this stage.) Stephen finds some explosives and Firebrace, himself close to death, tells him how to lay them in order to blast their way out of the tunnel. Before Stephen completes the task, Firebrace dies. The explosion successfully clears a way out for Stephen, and he stumbles out of the mine to be confronted by two German soldiers, who tell him that the war is over. Unlike in the novel, Stephen meets Fran√ßoise before the war is over and Jeanne implores him to be a part of her life; after the war he is seen showing up at Jeanne's house to be with her and his daughter. Whereas in the novel Stephen is terrified of birds, the television adaptation does not explore this although birdsong is frequently heard.

Spanning , it connects SR-196 and the Dugway Proving Ground with SR-36 between Rush Valley and the Deseret Chemical Depot. Route description State Route 199 begins at the junction with SR-196 near the control gate at Dugway Proving Ground in Skull Valley. The route travels northeast for , passing through the community of Terra before turning east and climbing over Johnson Pass in the Onaqui Mountains. Descending out of the mountains, the route continues to the east through the town of Clover before ending at SR-36, just north of the Deseret Chemical Depot. History In 1920, an improved gravel road over Johnson Pass from St. John to Orr's Ranch (just north of the modern-day terminus of SR-199) was built with the help of a donation from Carl G. Fisher, replacing Skull Valley Road (an unimproved dirt trail) as part of the Lincoln Highway.Kevin J. Patrick and Robert E. Wilson, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Lincoln Highway Resource Guide , August 2002 (submitted to the National Park Service for the National Register of Historic Places): , accessed January 2012 This road (along with the rest of the Lincoln Highway) was included as part of the state road system as an unnumbered highway from 1919 to 1925. Further west in Utah (near the current-day Dugway Proving Ground), Frank Seiberling, president of the Lincoln Highway Association and the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company committed $100,000 to build a short cut across the desert from County Well (west of Orr's Ranch) to Gold Hill, which would be known as the Goodyear Cut-off. After completing only , the state of Utah reevaluated its long-term highway plan and terminated the project, and instead, began constructing the Wendover Cut-off farther north. Utah officials favored this route, as it would keep southern California-bound motorists in the state longer by forcing them to take the Arrowhead Trail (now Interstate 15) south from Salt Lake City. The Wendover route became part of the Victory Highway, established in 1921.Reno Evening Gazette, May 16, 1921 With the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921, the federal government provided $75 million in matching funds to states for highway construction, but it required states to identify a maximum of 7% of its highway mileage as eligible for funds. The Wendover Cut-off was the sole highway west of Salt Lake City selected by Utah to receive federal funds, further cementing its status (over the Goodyear Cut-off) as the primary route from Utah to Northern California. The Wendover Cut-off was opened on July 13, 1925,Federal Highway Administration, FHWA By Day - July 13 and the system of United States Numbered Highways assigned it as part of U.S. Route 40 the following year. Furthermore, the state of Utah made this route part of the newly designated Utah State Route 4 in 1927. This forced the Lincoln Highway Association to accept the Wendover road as the route of the Lincoln Highway, to which it realigned in 1927. As a result of these changes, the road through St. John, Orr's Ranch, and the Goodyear Cut-off were left off the state highway system. State Route 199 was added to the state highway system in 1969, connecting Dugway with SR-36 south of Stockton, closely following the original Lincoln Highway stretch from St. John (now part of Rush Valley) to Orr's Ranch (just north of Dugway). A very similar route, SR 215, was designated from St. John to Dugway in 1957. This route was cancelled in 1959, and the road was never built.

He was a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives representing the 17th District from 2000 to 2013. He was reelected in 2016. He resigned on July 31, 2018. In 2011, Rivera Guerra was in the middle of a scandal, when it was revealed there were some irregularities regarding the registration and permits of his residence. Although the Ethics Committee of the House of Representatives initially dismissed the complaint, the case caused a public uproar among local newspapers and received major media attention. As a result, Governor Luis Fortu√±o and the PNP referred the case to the Department of Justice of Puerto Rico, and disqualified Rivera Guerra from running in the 2012 general election. After being removed from the party, Rivera Guerra started to campaign as a write-in candidate. He received more than seven thousand votes from the voters of Aguadilla and Moca. He was still unsuccessful to win. Early years and studies Jos√© Luis Rivera Guerra was born in Mayag√ºez on October 7, 1973. He studied on the island's public school system, graduating from the Jos√© de Diego High School on 1991. In 1997, he received a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry, with a concentration in Mathematics from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez. He then passed the licensing exam to be a chemist. Professional career Rivera Guerra served in the United States Army Reserve for eight years. Professionally, he has worked as a chemist with Procter & Gamble and as a Science teacher at the Liceo Aguadillano. He also directed the recycling program for Aguadilla. Political career Rivera Guerra was first elected to the Puerto Rico House of Representatives at the 2000 electionsElecciones Generales de 2000: Representantes Distrito 17 on CEEPUR becoming the youngest legislator elected in the history of that district. He was elected to represent District 17. During his first term, he was one of the PNP members involved in a controversial riot at the Office of Women Affairs, which resulted in the detainment of several party leaders. In 2003, Rivera Guerra won the primaries of his partyPrimarias 2003: Representantes Distrito 17 on CEEPUR and was again reelected at the general elections in 2004.Elecciones Generales 2004: Representantes Distrito 17 on CEEPUR That same year, he had to be expelled from a session after an aggressive outburst in which he broke a glass desk by hitting it. For the 2008 PNP primaries, Rivera Guerra became a close ally of candidate Luis G. Fortu√±o when he ran against former Governor and PNP president Pedro Rossell√≥. Rivera Guerra ran against Ernesto \\"Junior\\" Robledo and two other candidates in his district.Primarias 2008: Representantes por Distrito on CEEPUR Both Fortu√±o and Rivera Guerra prevailed in the primaries and in the general elections.Elecciones Generales 2008: Representante por Distrito 17 on CEEPUR He is running for mayor in the city of Aguadilla as an independent candidate in 2020. =Public scandal= At the end of 2011, Ernesto \\"Junior\\" Robledo presented various complaints against Rivera Guerra claiming irregularities in properly registering his residence with the Property Tax Collection Center (CRIM), the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA). Rivera Guerra denied the allegations and Governor Luis Fortu√±o defended him. Although initially, the House Ethics Committee had dismissed the issue, some irregularities and contradictions on the versions arose. As a result, Speaker Jenniffer Gonz√°lez evaluated the case individually and decided to send it back to the Ethics Committee. The scandal caused a public uproar among the people and the case received major media attention. On January 23, 2012, the House Ethics Committee determined that Rivera Guerra had committed no crime, but recommended that he be disciplined with a 10-day suspension due to his negligence in the issues regarding his properties. Again, this caused indignation among the people in the island, who made public manifestations against the decision. Minutes after the Ethics Committee made his decision, Governor Fortu√±o sent Rivera Guerra's case to the Department of Justice and said he would be evaluating his candidacy for the upcoming elections. On February 18, 2012, the Board of Directors of the PNP voted to disqualify Rivera Guerra from participating in the upcoming primaries. Still, Rivera Guerra campaigned as a write-in candidate for the elections, but was unsuccessful. On November 30, 2012, a court issued a warrant for the arrest of Rivera Guerra. The charges were construction of a pool without informing it to the Ethics Office, and living in his residence without the proper permits. On July 11, 2013, Rivera Guerra was sentenced to 40 days of community service, and was ordered to pay multiple fines that totaled $2,900. Personal life Rivera Guerra is married and has three children. He is an avid athlete, dedicating himself to martial arts and cycling. In March 2011 he suffered major injuries that kept him away from attending House sessions for several weeks when he was run over by a car while he was riding a bicycle and exercising.

Born in 1554, he distinguished himself in the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1578‚Äì90), gaining the trust of his Ottoman suzerains. He was appointed khan in 1588, after his homeland experienced a period of political turmoil. He failed to capture Moscow during his 1591 campaign against Tsardom of Russia, however he managed to secure a favorable peace treaty two years later. He was then summoned to support his Ottoman allies in the Long Turkish War, taking part in multiple military expeditions centered in Hungary. In late 1596, the Ottoman sultan briefly unseated ƒûazƒ± II Giray in favor of Fetih I Giray after heeding the advice of Grand Vizier Cƒ±ƒüalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha. He returned to power three months later, continuing his reign until his death in November 1607. Early life ƒûazƒ± Giray was born in 1554. Little is known about his youth, it is speculated that while being hanzade (son of the khan) he was sent to the Circassian tribe of Besleni to receive training in horsemanship and the military arts. His name is first mentioned in a document detailing a 1575 Tatar raid on Podolia. The raid was sparked by the revolt of Moldavian voivode John III the Terrible who refused to accept the raise in tribute he had to pay to the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans requested the Crimean Khanate to aid them in the conflict after realizing that Zaporozhian Cossacks had intervened on John's side. The conflict ended when the Ottomans executed the Cossack commander Ivan Pidkova and unseated John. In November 1578, Crimean khan Mehmed II Giray entered the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1578‚Äì90) on the Ottoman side. ƒûazƒ± Giray was among the soldiers taking part in the expedition. The Crimean army under the khan's brother Adil Giray relieved the besieged Shemakha garrison at a critical point, defeating the Safavids. The first rift between the allies appeared when the Ottomans prohibited the Tatars from conducting booty raids and insisted on organizing them into a regular unit of their army. Looting had been the primary objective of all Tatar military campaigns and a major source of wealth for the common soldier as they did not receive salaries. The dispute was settled after the Tatars managed to pillage a convoy carrying the treasury of Aras Khan. On 30 November, the Tatar army clashed with the main Safavid force on the Menla Hasan river. The battle lasted three days and ended with a Tatar defeat, Adil Giray was captured yet ƒûazƒ± Giray managed to escape. Due to Adil's death in captivity Mehmed II Giray appointed his son Saadet II Giray as kalgay. A year later, Mehmed II Giray arrived at the front with reinforcements, departing in the summer after a successful raid on Gence netted him enough booty. In the meantime Mehmed's younger brother Alp Giray instigated a revolt, in an effort to take the throne for himself. The Ottomans questioned the loyalty of the khan after he declared that he was an independent ruler rather than an Ottoman vassal, ordering ƒ∞sl√¢m II Giray to ascend. ƒûazƒ± Giray remained in the Caucasus at the head of a small force. In the winter of 1579, ƒûazƒ± Giray distinguished himself during a surprise attack on a Safavid encampment in Gence. The Ottoman sultan rewarded him for this action with 50,000 ak√ßes. In the spring of 1581, ƒûazƒ± Giray suffered a defeat in the vicinity of Shemakha and taken prisoner. After refusing numerous proposals of collaboration he was imprisoned in the Alamut Castle. He managed to escape after he was transferred to Tabriz, joining √ñzdemiroƒülu Osman Pasha in Erzurum. He continued his participation in the campaign until the death of Osman Pasha on 30 November 1585. He then traveled to Constantinople where he was granted the salyane of Yambol where he continued to live until 1588. That year he received news that he was appointed khan in place of his brother ƒ∞sl√¢m II Giray. The Ottomans chose ƒûazƒ± Giray due to his familiarity of the inner workings of the empire and his experience in military affairs. Upon his arrival his authority was not disputed by the Crimean tribal aristocracy. First Reign ƒûazƒ± Giray's first action as khan was to appoint his brother Fetih Giray and nephew Nepht Giray as the first and second heirs apparent (Kalgay and Nura'l-din respectively) to the throne. Alp Giray and his Nura'l-din Sakay Giray fled to Constantinople and Circassia respectively. He then moved in to secure the khanate's external borders from the Cossacks who had stepped up their raids following the death of Stephen B√°thory in 1586. A fort was erected on the mouth of river Dnieper and a punitive expedition was launched on Podolia. The expansion of Russian influence in the Caucasus the successive reigns of Ivan the Terrible and Feodor I caused concern in Crimea. ƒûazƒ± Giray seized opportunity of a Swedish offer of an alliance to attack Muscovy from the south, while the Swedes invaded from the north. On 13 July 1591, the Crimeans besieged Moscow, realizing that their cavalry was no match for the city's modern fortifications they lifted the siege. The khan was wounded in the campaign, returning to his palace in a cart on 9 August. After negotiations over a peace agreement broke down Fetih Giray successfully raided Tula and Ryazan, taking numerous prisoners later to be sold in the khanate's lucrative slave markets. Fearing a war on two fronts the Muscovites yielded, gifting the khan 10,000 rubles and agreeing to withdraw the Cossacks from Terek and Don. In return the Tatars swore not to attack Russia during the summer of 1594, the agreement was concluded in October 1593. The agreement paved the way for the Crimean intervention into the Long Turkish War in Hungary, while Russia was able to augment its northern borders. On 28 April 1594, the Tatar army crossed into the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth en route to Hungary. The Tatars found the Balkan pass blocked by ruble and then marched to the so called Tatar pass which was guarded by Kaspar Kornis an officer of the Voivode of Transylvania Sigismund B√°thory and commander of the nearby Huszt castle. A battle ensued, whereupon the defenders suffered a devastating defeat. The Tatars clashed with the Hungarians under Bastuvan in Devirsin (possibly Debrecen), achieving another victory. The Tatar force united with their Ottoman allies commanded by grand vizier Koca Sinan Pasha on 31 July, the event was later celebrated by a full dress military parade and a feast. At the time the Muslim army had camped opposite of Raab and was separated from the city by the river of the same name. On 1 August, the Ottoman‚ÄìTatar army crossed the river and stormed the Raab castle, they were met by a flurry of gunfire and were forced to retreat. The following day the Ottomans began constructing a bridge across the river, enabling their musketeers and artillery to close in on their target. On 27 September, a second assault took place, it proved successful and the city fell. A part of the Crimean army was diverted to the fort of P√°pa, which they found abandoned. The Muslims then besieged Kom√°rom, however the siege was soon lifted after the advent of winter. ƒûazƒ± Giray retired to his winter quarters after leaving 2,000 of his men to garrison P√°pa and Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. The palace intrigues surrounding the death of sultan Murad III frustrated Ottoman plans in Hungary. More importantly Wallachian voivode Michael the Brave and voidode of Moldavia Aaron the Tyrant had revolted against Ottoman authority. In late January 1595, the Tatars now loaded with booty began their journey home. Upon crossing the frozen Danube into Wallachia they were attacked by Michael's troops, suffering a devastating defeat they fell back to Silistra. The Khan informed the grand vizier Serdar Ferhad Pasha of the new state of affairs in Wallachia and urged him to dispatch a fleet to Ochakiv in order to ferry a 100,000 man army under Fetih Giray to the Balkans. The khan spent the summer in Crimea. The arrival of Fetih's army in September coincided with the Ottoman decision to transform Wallachia and Moldavia from tributary states into beylerbeyliks. ƒûazƒ± Giray seized the opportunity and requested that one of his relatives be appointed governor of the new province. The Ottomans feared that the Tatars would merge Moldavia with the rest of the khanate and instead appointed Ahmed Bey to the position. The Tatars conquered Moldavia after vanquishing Sigismund B√°thory's and »òtefan RƒÉzvan's forces. The Poles reacted by tasking Jan Zamoyski with checking the Tatar advance in the region. The two sides fought the Battle of Cecora (1595) on 19 September, before agreeing to mutually withdraw and recognize Ieremia MovilƒÉ as the new Moldavian voivode. The khan wintered in Bender, launching numerous diversionary raids into Wallachia while Fetih Giray besieged Eger with the Ottomans. In the meantime, the Habsburgs had crossed the swamps in the Eger area posing a threat to the Muslim army. The two sides engaged in the Battle of Keresztes on 26 October 1596. The Muslims emerged victorious at the conclusion of the battle, the largest to take place during the course of the war. Second Reign Cƒ±ƒüalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha was appointed Grand Vizier in recognition of his role in the battle. He immediately dismissed ƒûazƒ± Giray and elevated Fetih I Giray to khan. ƒûazƒ± Giray's refusal to personally participate in the campaign, alleged separatist tendencies and his aspirations over Moldavia being the main reasons behind the downfall. ƒûazƒ± Giray addressed a letter to the sultan claiming that he was preoccupied by the defense of Wallachia from Michael the Brave and that his dismissal was unjust since he did not engage in bribery, revolt or oppression of rayah. Although he was supported by a number of viziers, his letter had not achieved the desired effect and the sultan remained true to his word. Fetih accepted his new role with reluctance as he only commanded 20,000 soldiers and the Ottomans were unable to provide him with reinforcements due to their commitments in Hungary. Fetih built his network of supporters around the relatives of Selamet Giray and Baht Giray. However his influence was still limited and the Tatar army demanded that the old khan be brought back. Cƒ±ƒüalazade was dismissed only 20 days after his appointment further complicating the situation, the new grand vizier Damat Ibrahim Pasha supported the idea of reinstating ƒûazƒ± Giray. The sultan prepared two different letters of confirmation one for Fetih and another for ƒûazƒ±, instructing his representative Hamdan Agha to grant the letter to the candidate with the biggest base of support among the Tatars. Unbeknownst to the sultan Hamdan Agha had been a long time personal friend of ƒûazƒ± Giray, giving him the letter along with the regalia. Fearing for his safety Fetih fled to the Circassian controlled Taman Peninsula, he took the decision to meet ƒûazƒ± Giray one last time before departing for Constantinople. He was murdered by a member of the Mangit tribe outside of Kefe, Baht Giray met a similar fate. Selamet Giray avoided the power struggle by remaining in Circassia. Fetih's reign of three months was thus cut short and ƒûazƒ± Giray regained control over the khanate in early 1597. The khan refused to take part in the 1597 Ottoman campaign in Hungary. After renewing the truce with Russia, he sent envoys to Poland, Wallachia and Moldavia in an attempt to gain concessions. The Crimean army returned to the Balkans in July 1598. The khan served as an intermediary between the sultan and emperor Rudolf II, as the Ottomans sought to divert forces to Anatolia due to the outbreak of the Celali rebellions. The Tatars joined the Ottoman war camp at Beckerek on 29 August, afterwards the khan took active part in the planning of the upcoming offensive in Wallachia. Marching along the Moros river, the Muslims conquered the small fort of Canat before besieging their main target Varad on 1 October. Major shortages in gunpowder and ammunition, as well as difficult weather conditions rendered the siege unsuccessful. The Habsburgs had exploited the diversion of Ottoman troops to Wallachia by seizing Tata, V√°rpalota and Veszpr√©m, as well as encircling Buda. The khan spent the winter in Sombor, while the Tatar contingent was stationed in Szeged. Citing shortages in provisions the khan declared that the Crimeans would return home despite repeated Ottoman requests for him to remain, this may be attributed to bribes he had received from Rudolf II. He remained within the khanate until 1602 , during that time he had fallen seriously ill. He accused his wife of bewitching him, leading to her execution. In 1601, he learned that Nura'l-din Devlet Giray had conspired with a number of Mirzas to assassinate and take power for themselves. The plotters were invited to a feast where they were gunned down by arquebusiers. Devlet Giray's brothers fled either to Circassia or Anatolia with Selamet Giray following suit. In late August 1602, the khan once again set off for the Hungarian plains. On 23 September, the Tatars were defeated in the battle of Telzayn, whereupon the fell back to Silistria and united with the Ottomans in the middle of October. ƒûazƒ± Giray spent the winter in P√©cs, while his army commenced raids on the Meƒëimurje mountains, Lugoj, Sebe»ô, Tokaj, rivers Krka and R√°ba. The Tatars rode home at the end of the winter after the sultan failed to satisfy their monetary demands. Little is known about the last years of the khan's life. He did not campaign in person, sending his son and kalgay Toqtamƒ±≈ü Giray to Hungary in 1604. He erected the castle of Gazikerman in Circassia, dying from a plague outbreak shortly afterwards (November 1607). Toqtamƒ±≈ü Giray succeeded him as khan following his death.

The wreckage site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. History Ottawa, originally named Boscobel, was built in Chicago, Illinois. It was the largest tug ever built in Chicago at the time and remained the largest and most powerful tug on the Great Lakes until its sinking in 1909. Originally the boat was used for rafting logs on Lake Michigan, but in 1901 was bought (and renamed) by the Reid Wrecking Company, based in Sarnia, Ontario. On November 13, 1909, a steamboat passing the Apostle Islands became stranded on a shoal two miles off of Outer Island during a storm. The ship's first mate and other members of the crew launched the lifeboat and went to land in order to get help. Four vessels tried for a week to aid the steamboat. Eventually, three more vessels, including Ottawa, were dispatched to the scene. On November 29, they were finally able to free the steamboat. That evening, the Ottawas crew ate dinner and retired to bed. Less than 30 minutes later, they were woken by a fire that was already out of control. Ottawa was pushed away from the steamboat that they had earlier rescued by the other vessels in efforts to stop the spread of fire and another tugboat was sent to help Ottawa. Despite the efforts, Ottawa burned to the waterline and sank. All crew members were saved. The cause of the fire remains unknown. Theories include that the fire was a result of spontaneous combustion in the ship's coal bunkers, which contained 130 tons of fuel.

CryoJet/IceJet technology uses ice particles made of water coming from a running water or freshwater system to cut material. While the ice particles are cutting material, they melt and go into the water tank of the machine. The pressurized water acting as a cutting jet can be re-used, with adequate filtering, creating a closed water circuit. However, the majority of users do not re-use the water. If more widely used, CryoJet may produce a drastic reduction in the amount of abrasive waste spill currently produced during the water jet cutting process, as no mineral abrasive is used by this technology. Ice Generation There are two different approaches to ice particles generation. *The ice particles can be prepared beforehand using an ice particle generator, stored in a reservoir and then fed to the conventional entrainment based jetting head. *The need for ice particle generators, cooled storing facilities and conveying equipment can be eliminated by forming the ice particles in situ during the water jet formation. The ice jet in this case is generated either by sub-cooling of pressurized water and controlled phase transformation during pressure relaxation in the jet nozzle, or by phase transformation by entrainment of cold liquid gases such as liquid nitrogen (N2)(see: Phase diagram of water). Advantages In comparison to other cutting technologies such as plasma cutting or laser cutting, the traditional water jet cutter technology produces extra waste material (in addition to the kerf material itself). Above all, the use of mineral abrasives for improving the performance of the cutting jet is increasingly becoming a problem. Firstly, as a consumer, it is the most significant cost factor of the process, and secondly, it represents more than 99% of the waste material generated during cutting processes. Therefore, it requires a complex and expensive waste management system. Consequently, several approaches for eliminating the need of mineral abrasives while maintaining its powerful cutting performance have been discussed by researchers. History The first experimental researching done on Ice Jet technology dates back to 1982, when the first ice particles were created by mechanical crushing of bigger ice particles. Galecki and Vickers [Gal82] performed surface cleaning and abrading with an ice-blasting technique. The ice particles were produced by refrigeration of 3 cm blocks, which were then transferred to a container of liquid nitrogen where the ice cubes were further cooled, and finally transferred to a mechanical crusher where they were crushed and subsequently entrained into a nozzle. Also in 1982, Krzysztof et al. showed that one of the most promising applications for ice particles is the cleaning technology. Water ice is readily available, inexpensive material, which can be used as a green manufacturing tool. Only water, electricity and refrigerant are needed for the fabrication of this tool, which can be produced just in time. The use of ice tools might practically prevent pollution and eliminate work piece contamination. Since then, several researchers have developed equipment for producing ice particles, mainly for cleaning [Set98], polishing [His94] and surface decontaminating [Ges99] purposes. Newer research works [Shan05] and [Klu05] show that ice particles can be used for water jet applications such as cleaning, degreasing and cutting, with its concept based on the convective heat transfer between a cold cryogenic gas and atomized water droplets. Ice particles are formed inside the system by transferring latent heat of water droplets to liquid nitrogen. Kluz et al. show that the air-ice particle stream can be generated and applied for processing of bio materials and food. The performed studies showed feasibility and effectiveness of the use of fine ice powder as an abrasive, being the energy effectiveness of the process acceptable and the technology rather simple. Anyway, the process productivity is less than when using mineral abrasive particles. A similar technology is the high pressure hybrid water-abrasive-ice jet treatment. Such technology is based on a high- pressure abrasive-water jet with addition of dry-ice pellets CO2. Borkowski et al. [Bor03] show that effectiveness of surface treatment with the hybrid jet depends on the quality of ice particles.

Known officially in Russian as rezervniye polosy (\\"reserved lanes\\") notably but not exclusively used by ZiL and Chaika brand limousines transporting high ranking government and military functionaries of the Soviet Union. ZiL lanes emerged in the 1960s during the rule of Leonid Brezhnev, replacing the previous system of having other vehicles flagged down to make way for those of top officials. A two way lane was inserted into the middle of some of Moscow's main highways in place of the central reservations, and were off-limits to all traffic but authorised civilian and emergency service vehicles. ZiL lanes and restricted routes caused considerable disruption to Moscow's traffic because of the absolute priority given to their users. The Guardian's Martin Kettle described the frustration they caused to ordinary motorists in the mid-1980s: There were two principal ZiL lanes in Moscow. The one on Leninsky Prospekt was used to shuttle officials to and from Vnukovo International Airport (favoured for government traffic) while the other was on Kutuzovsky Prospekt, en route to the elite residential area of Dorogomilovo District and leading out of the city to the country dachas of the Communist Party elite. The latter was a key part of what was termed the \\"Government Route\\", a network of connecting city roads linking the Kremlin with the residences of the members of the nomenklatura. The network was always heavily policed and was off-limits to casual traffic until the late 1960s. The Leninsky Prospekt ZiL lane is no longer used as Vnukovo is no longer the government's preferential airport. However, the Kutuzovsky Prospekt lane continues to exist, and is used by Russia's current political elite who still maintain dachas in Moscow's outskirts, although they nowadays get driven by German luxury cars rather than ZiLs or Chaikas. London's \\"Zil lanes\\" The term has also been used pejoratively for the games lanes of the Olympic route network in London that were dedicated to vehicles transporting VIPs, athletes and officials during the 2012 Summer Olympics. Regular traffic was blocked from many Olympic Lanes, though local buses could share some of them. Such lanes have been used in other Olympic events, but attracted controversy in London for their disruptive effect on the traffic and because corporate sponsors were also entitled to use the lanes despite not having an operational need.

George Chandler (1779?‚Äì1859) was a 19th-century Anglican priest. Education Chandler was educated at Winchester College, New College, Oxford, and the Inner Temple. New College, Oxford awarded him his B.C.L. (Bachelor of Civil Law) in 1804 and D.C.L. (Doctor of Civil Law) in 1824. Career Chandler was Bampton Lecturer in 1825, and Chairman of the Committee appointed by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) of General Literature. Some of the more time-consuming work, he did for the SPCK, was the editing of their school books. Between 1825 and 1847, Chandler was Rector of All Souls Church, Langham Place, Marylebone, Middlesex, and from 1830 to 1859 was Dean of Chichester. Because of his duties at All Souls, Chandler was only in Chichester for 90 days a year. It was not unusual for deanships to be part-time positions. The belief that deaneries should be full- time appointments had contributed to strained relations between deans and their chapters. Between 1830 and 1902 there were five Deans of Chichester, the first was Chandler and he probably was the one who had the best rapport with his chapter, whereas the four deans that succeeded him all had problems. At the establishment of the Chichester Literary and Ecclesiological Society in February 1831, Chandler accepted the office of President and delivered the inaugural lecture. He spent much time on their affairs and for many years continued to give the annual opening address of the session. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1833. In partnership with William Otter (the Bishop of Chichester), a Theological College was created in Chichester in 1839, with Charles Marriott as the first principal. Building and restoration work The former church of St Peter the Great. Chichester Cathedral was in a poor state of repair when Chandler was appointed Dean. There had been a lot of damage to the cathedral during the Reformation, at the instigation of the Vicar General, Thomas Cromwell. The records and muniments were damaged during the civil war after the siege of Chichester, with the cathedral library itself nearly being sold off in London. The destruction of the contents of the cathedral had been compounded by years of neglect. Chandler took on the task of restoring the cathedral and work started during the 1840s. With restoration being carried out on the nave and its windows. Joseph Butler was appointed architect and surveyor in 1841. However Chandler refused to sanction the restoration of the choir, on the grounds that the architectural knowledge was not sufficiently advanced! The choir was not restored during Chandler's tenure but he did leave ¬£2000 in his will for its restoration. In the north transept of Chichester Cathedral, there was the parish church (or sub deanery) of St Peter the Great; its presence was possibly due to the cathedral being moved in 1075 from the Saxon see in Selsey to the site of the original St Peter's church in Chichester, hence the sharing of the property. In 1841 the partition was removed and plans for a separate parish church were supported by Chandler. After a public appeal, Richard Cromwell Carpenter was appointed as architect and the church built in 1848‚Äì52. Chandler provided funds for the pews in the new church out of his own pocket. The church could seat hundred people, making it the largest parish church in Chichester. However faced with a diminishing congregation and the possibility of expensive repair bills it was put up for sale in 1979. It now serves as a restaurant and bar.

He placed second behind Knockanroe Rover. Following a third-place finish in the Scottish Greyhound Derby, he returned to Wimbledon to take part in the English Greyhound Derby. He was defeated in the second round, but ultimately qualified for the final. He took the title from second- placed Rackethall Jet by three and a half lengths.

The victory earned ¬£50,000 for his owner, and made Rapid Ranger only the third Greyhound to win the Derby twice along with Mick the Miller and Patricias Hope. Ranger was retired, but after a change of heart by his owner and trainer prior to the 2002 Derby, he was entered once more in an attempt to become the first dog to take the title on three occasions. He won in the first round, but his career ended for the final time when he was knocked out of the competition after two further rounds. Retirement and later life A digitally composited artwork featuring Rapid Ranger was created by photographer Gideon Hart. The original hangs in the Crown and Sceptre public house in London W12. After retirement, he moved to live with Lorraine Patient in 2007. This enabled White to visit him on a regular basis. He was taken to a breeder's show in Harlow during his later life to take part in a parade of champions, but became over-excited and suffered a minor stroke. After suffering a further stroke on 30 September 2010, he was euthanized. The decision was made after he was initially prescribed medication but was in distress after losing the use of his legs.

It was the eighth tropical cyclone, the sixth named storm and the second tropical cyclone to form during the 2011‚Äì12 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. Funso was also the first intense tropical cyclone since Gelane in 2010 and the first storm to affect Mozambique since Jokwe in 2008. Meteorological history The origins of Cyclone Funso were from an area of convection in the Mozambique Channel. On January 17, a low-level circulation developed in the area as the convection organized into intense rainbands. An upper-level anticyclone provided favorable conditions for development, including weak wind shear and good outflow. The system encountered warm sea surface temperatures, and favorable inflow from the south of its circulation was expected to increase after Subtropical Depression Dando dissipated over southern Africa. Late on January 18, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, indicating a high chance of the system becoming a tropical cyclone. At 0000 UTC the next day, M√©t√©o-France (MF) classified it as Tropical Disturbance 8 about halfway between Mozambique and Madagascar in the northern Mozambique Channel. About six hours later, the agency upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression, after the convection became better organized. The JTWC had also begun issuing advisories on the system by that time, labeling it Tropical Cyclone 08S. Upon forming on January 19, the depression was moving to the southwest along the northern edge of a ridge. Though the system's low- level structure was disorganized, it gradually improved over the course of the day; MF upgraded the system to Moderate Tropical Storm Funso at 1200 UTC on January 19, or about 12 hours after its formation. Around that time, there was a warm spot, or a precursor to an eye, in the middle of a circular area of convection. Funso rapidly intensified after the eye became better established, and the MF upgraded the storm to a tropical cyclone - the equivalent of a 120 km/h (75 mph) hurricane - early on January 20. By that time, the outflow had increased significantly, partly due to an upper-level trough providing ventilation to the southeast. Shortly after Funso intensified into a tropical cyclone, the eye disappeared on satellite imagery, although this was due to the small size of the eyewall. Further intensification was forecast to be limited by the cyclone's interaction with the coast of Mozambique, as well as upwelling from its slow movement. On January 20, Funso turned to the west and slowed, due to its position between a ridge to the northwest of Madagascar and another ridge near the Mozambique‚ÄìSouth Africa border. The convection to storm's west over land diminished while the center remained well-organized. Despite land interaction, Funso intensified further, and the JTWC assessed 1 minute winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) early on January 21, based on the appearance of a well-defined eye 15 km (9 mi) in diameter. Around the same time, MF estimated the storm attained 10 minute maximum sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph), making Funso an intense tropical cyclone. At the time, the storm was located about 110 km (70 mi) east of Quelimane, Mozambique, and its movement was nearly stationary. By late on January 21, however, Funso weakened due to land disrupting the convection. A building ridge to the north forced the cyclone to the southeast into an area favorable for re-intensification. As the storm moved away from the Mozambique coastline, the convection became better organized, and the eye gradually reformed. Minimal wind shear, excellent outflow, and water temperatures of at least allowed for significant strengthening. Late on January 23, the JTWC estimated 1 minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (135 mph), and the agency forecast further strengthening to 260 km/h (160 mph). Early the next day, MF estimated 10 minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) about 330 km (200 mi) southeast of Quelimane, Mozambique. Intense Tropical Cyclone Funso on January 26, after an eyewall replacement cycle-the eye at the time of this image measured approximately 80 kilometers in diameter After reaching peak intensity, Funso turned toward the southwest, due to a building ridge to its east. Late on January 24, the cyclone began an eyewall replacement cycle, which initiated a brief weakening trend. MF remarked that Funso weakened below intense tropical cyclone intensity early on January 25. At the same time, the JTWC estimated the cyclone intensified further to peak 1 minute sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph), based on estimates via the Dvorak technique. The agency noted that the eyewall replacement cycle finished and produced a well-defined eye 28 km (17 mi) in diameter. At 1200 UTC on January 25, MF again upgraded Funso to an intense tropical cyclone, and later that day the cyclone began another eyewall replacement cycle, and developed a larger eye measuring 55 kilometers across. Funso underwent another eyewall replacement cycle on January 27 as it started weakening. On January 27, the government of Mozambique formally announced that the cyclone had begun to gradually weaken, in the early-morning hours. Cyclone Funso posed no imminent threat to the northeastern coast of South Africa. On January 28, Funso rapidly weakened and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, due to exposure to strong vertical wind shear, and colder sea surface temperatures below 25¬∞C. On the next day, Funso's extratropical remnant dissipated. Impact and preparations During the overnight hours of January 18, a ship carrying 54 people sank on its way from Anjouan to Mayotte amidst rough seas produced by Funso, while the developing storm remained offshore in its early stages. At least 15 passengers drowned while dozens remain missing. http://www.linfo.re/-Faits-divers,372-/Le-naufrage-d-un-kwassa-kwassa- fait-15-morts-a-Anjouan Although the core of the storm never made landfall in Mozambique, over three million people there were affected by tropical storm- force winds. The most affected area was Zambezia Province, where twelve people were killed by Funso, and 2,571 families were directly affected as of January 23. Seven of the fatalities occurred in the Maganja da Costa District, where 1,610 houses were destroyed, and one death was in Zambezia's capital city of Quelimane, where heavy rainfall flooded most neighborhoods, owing to poor drainage systems. In the town, the flooding destroyed four houses, and several other cities along the coastline experienced flooding. In Nicoadala District, the storm destroyed 66 houses and killed two people. Overall, more than 5000 people were displaced by the weather conditions. In Chokwe, at least 3,900 hectares of rice fields were flooded, while three people were missing in Guij√° District, Gaza Province on January 25. After affecting the central Mozambique provinces, Funso brushed the coastline of the Inhambane Province in the south with rains and winds of 70 km/h (40 mph). At least 70,000 people were without a clean drinking water supply following the storm, and more than 56,000 were left homeless in Mozambique. The cyclone hit the country about a week after Subtropical Depression Dando struck southern Mozambique, causing flooding and deaths. Initial forecasts suggested that the cyclone would impact South Africa or make landfall in southern Mozambique, but this became less likely as the storm continued tracking south. Nevertheless, some local tourists voluntarily evacuated the coastal city of Inhambane in Mozambique in anticipation of the storm. In Malawi, a country adjacent to Mozambique, the cyclone dropped heavy rainfall, causing two rivers near Nsanje to exceed their banks and flood nearby villages. Authorities were concerned about the fate of more than 450 families that lost their homes in the southern Nsanje District due to the effects of Funso, which mostly affected Bangula and Phokela, as three rivers overflowed. Across Southern Malawi, the storm destroyed more than 320 houses and flooded 125 more, primarily in Bangula and Phokela. As a result, about 5,000 people had to evacuate their homes during flooding on the Shire River and Ruo River, many of whom requiring rescue by helicopter or motorboat as they were stranded in the remaining unflooded areas of land. At least 30 villages became isolated after flooding destroyed roads and bridges between Blantyre and Nsanje. The flooding also killed livestock and affected maize fields, leaving whole communities at risk of starvation. As the cyclone retreated southward, waves up to occurred on the coasts of southern Mozambique and western Madagascar. =Ongoing floods= The impact of Cyclone Funso stalling over Zambezia Province worsened an ongoing flood situation that had been exacerbated by monsoon rains, producing flooding in Mozambique, Malawi, South Africa and Swaziland. Prior to Funso's impact, the landfall of Subtropical Depression Dando on January 16 over southeastern Africa killed at least ten people in Mozambique and South Africa, including six people in Mpumalanga Province in South Africa; Mpumalanga and Limpopo were the regions most heavily affected. During the inland flooding triggered by Dando, several drownings occurred, including one man swept away on the Mbuluzi River in Swaziland. Dando was the first tropical cyclone to impact southern Mozambique since Domoina in 1984. In Mozambique, flooding from the tropical cyclones cut off the arterial North-South Highway to Maputo, the capital of the country, as the Komati River flooded its banks. Traffic re-opened by January 24. High water levels occurred on the Movene River, an upstream tributary of the Umbeluzi River from which Maputo gets its water supply, which limited access to the treatment plant, leaving the city's water polluted. By January 25, twenty-five fatalities were confirmed from the combined flooding caused by Dando and Funso, including 16 in Zambezia and 9 in Gaza Province, where the initial flooding from Dando affected 5,393 families. Flooding also occurred in Inhambane Province. Tens of thousands of people were made homeless in the floods, and authorities expected the casualty toll to rise. Meteorologists predicted the flooding rains to continue for most of Mozambique throughout the first months of 2012.

The downtown Lee Park encampment was taken down on November 30, 2011, when 18 members of the movement were arrested and charged with trespassing.Moomaw, December 1, 2011 The group failed to establish a campsite after the eviction, although they continued to hold their 'General Assemblies' and participate in targeted actions for several months thereafter.NBC29 January 14, 2012 The group's protests target social and economic injustice both locally and nationally. Although the group's website is still online, there have not been any 'Occupy' events in Charlottesville since February 2012. Background The Occupy Wall Street movement began on September 17, 2011, as a protest against economic and social injustice.#Occupy Wall Street Retrieved 2012-1-23 Soon thereafter, autonomous satellite protests sprung up across the world, most of them in the United States. In the weeks leading up to the October 15 occupation in Charlottesville, protesters first met at Random Row books on October 5 and again on October 12, for the first Official General Assembly. Among other topics, \\"they discussed and developed a set of shared values for community members, including social and economic justice, mutual respect, cooperation and non-violence with each other\\". The occupiers chose to take Lee Park, a public park in the north downtown neighborhood. Chronology Several meetings in the first half of October lead up to Occupy Charlottesville's first action, which was a march from McGuffey Park (a few blocks away from the group's eventual campsite) to protest at a luncheon for the University of Virginia's corporate sponsors, hosted by the university's President, Teresa A. Sullivan. Later that night, the campsite was established in Lee Park. This physical presence lasted until the Charlottesville Police Department broke the encampment on November 30, 2011. The group remains active and continues to organize actions, as well as joining long-existing groups in actions of their own.Dunleavy, January 14, 2012 =Weeks 1 through 5= Occupy Charlottesville gathered at one of their General Assemblies Charlottesville City officials granted the group a three- day overnight permit on October 18, 2011.Strong, October 18, 2011 On October 26, the City Parks and Recreation Director, Brian Daly, granted the protesters an automatic permit renewal for the next 30 days, provided no problems arose.Moomaw, October 26, 2011 On November 1, three homeless men were arrested in Lee Park for various alcohol infractions, while two underage girls were taken to the hospital with \\"signs of alcohol consumption\\". Charlottesville Police Lt. Ronnie Roberts reported that the men were \\"some of [their] area homeless that [they're] pretty familiar with\\", and that the men were \\"not with Occupy Charlottesville\\". After the incident, City spokesman Rick Barrick said, \\"To date we have had nothing but cooperation from those in Lee Park who identify themselves as being part of Occupy Charlottesville.\\"Moomaw, November 1, 2011 Some members of the community, notably Carole Thorpe as chairwoman of the Jefferson Area Tea Party, called for an end to the encampment. Mrs. Thorpe argued that City Council (an all-Democrat body) was making politically preferential accommodations and exceptions to the group which were unfair. She warned that the encampment would end badly and reflect poorly on the city and on City Council itself. Charlottesville City Council expressed no intention of disbanding the encampment before the permit expired on Thanksgiving Day. City Councilor Kristin Szakos expressed her belief \\"that it's a First Amendment issue ... And I think the First Amendment isn't limited to certain times of the day', while then-Mayor Dave Norris proposed \\"a community discussion about turning a neighborhood park into a \\"24/7 free-speech zone\\".\\"Moomaw, November 11, 2011 =November 21 appeal to city council= Occupy Charlottesville packs Charlottesville City Council chambers in what Councilor David Brown says is the best-attended meeting in his 8 years serving. Supporters wear red and almost 60 people ask the council to allow the encampment. A handful of those who speak on the issue ask for the council to start enforcing the 11 pm curfew in Lee Park. On November 21, 2011, members of Occupy Charlottesville expressed their intention to continue the occupation to Charlottesville City Council. Many asked for the City to suspend the 11 pm curfew. Over 100 supporters packed the chambers in what Councilor David Brown called the best-attended meeting in his eight years on the board. An overflow room was opened for people who could not fit into the council chambers. About 60 people spoke to City Council regarding Occupy Charlottesville, a handful of them against its continued presence.Jaglois, November 22, 2011 Councilor response followed the public comments portion of the meeting. During this response portion of the meeting Councilor Szakos stated that she \\"[thinks] that free speech doesn't expire at 11 o'clock. It doesn't expire at Thanksgiving.\\" Szakos was the sole councilor in favor of allowing the occupation to continue in Lee Park despite complaints by some members of the neighborhood.Lewis, November 22, 2011 The rest of the council was in favor of the continuation of Occupy Charlottesville, albeit not in Lee Park. A desire was expressed to move the occupation to a new location, approved by the local city government. Mayor Dave Norris expressed his desire to find an alternative location for the occupiers other than a \\"neighborhood park\\". Although he expressed general support for the movement, he was resolved to end the Lee Park encampment. > I guess for me, the question is, is the movement stronger than this park? I > think it is. I think it's clear that it is. City spokesmen Ric Barrick sent out an email saying that Occupy Charlottesville would continue to receive 3-day permits for Lee Park until a suitable alternative location was found, and that no end date had been set for the city's thus-far tolerant stance toward the occupation.Moomaw, Graham. November 22, 2011 =Eviction= Despite the enthusiasm for the movement expressed at the November 21 City Council meeting an alternative location was not determined. City government opted to evict the protesters on November 30, 2011.Staff, November 1, 2012 After the 11:00 curfew came into effect, over 20 police officers moved in. Occupy supporters packed the sidewalk, City Council member Kristin Szakos among them. Eighteen arrests were made and sixteen of those arrested were taken to the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail while the other two were issued summons. One protester, Veronica Fitzhugh, was given an indecent exposure charge for running naked through the streets (in front of many children present) in addition to trespassing. Protesters yelled obscenities at the police as they were removed from Lee Park. The next night, occupiers met at the city's \\"Free Speech Wall\\", which had notices posted on it that camping would not be allowed. Mayor Norris expressed displeasure with the spectacle, calling it the \\"death knell\\" for the group. > ... The decision they made on Tuesday night ... a majority of them agreed to > work with the city on finding another venue, but obviously a significant > number decided to poke the city in the eye on the way out of Lee Park and > provoke a confrontation with the city. Szakos was displeased the city opted to remove and arrest the protesters. \\"I personally, as a councilor, feel very strongly that this is part of the speech that should be protected by the Constitution,\\" Szakos said. \\"And I personally disagree with us ordering them out.\\" =November 30 to present= Despite the enthusiasm for the movement expressed at the November 21 City Council meeting an alternative location was not determined. City government opted to evict the protesters on November 30, 2011. On December 15, 2011 a single male protester was cited for impeding traffic during a march to commemorate two months since the inception of the occupation. Lt. Ronnie Roberts, of the CPD, said the group was large enough to block rush hour traffic on West Main Street.The Daily Progres', December 15, 2011 On January 27, the Charlottesville General District Court found 17 of the 18 protesters who were arrested in November guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor for trespassing. Each of the convicted protesters must pay a $100 fine plus court costs. The 18th protester, Mario Brown had plead guilty and been sentenced to community service in December. Veronica Fitzhugh, who stripped naked to read a statement during the eviction, had her indecent exposure charge dismissed, as the court considered her actions to be \\"political, rather than sexual in nature\\". Jeff Fogel, a National Lawyers Guild attorney who represented Occupy Charlottesville was dissatisfied with the verdict.

A police brutality probe was conducted by the CPD but they declined to release the results.Richmond Times-Dispatch, January 22, 2012 Dave Norris, who was mayor when Occupy Charlottesville was evicted, said the current policy of the CPD is that they do not release information about disciplinary action. He added that he thought \\"it would probably serve the community well to at least provide some transparency in terms of the actions that may have taken place.\\" However, Satyendra Huja, who had taken over Norris' job as mayor by the time the police brutality investigation was complete, felt that it was unnecessary for the police to release the results of their probe. He felt that since the Charlottesville Police Department did not take any action against its officers, the brutality complaints were baseless.Moomaw, January 30, 2011 =Impact= On June 3, 2012, Charlottesville City Council passed a resolution condemning the Supreme Court's decision in the case Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission as harmful to the democratic process. Although the citizen-proposed resolution was not directly linked to Occupy Charlottesville, several key members of Occupy Charlottesville helped push the resolution and City Council.

Schrader (born ) is an American educator and former academic administrator. She was president of Wright State University from July 1, 2017 until she stepped down from the position December 31, 2019 midway through her five-year appointment. She was previously the chancellor of Missouri University of Science and Technology. Early life and education Schrader received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering with a concentration in computers and communications from Valparaiso University in 1984, and master's and doctorate degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Notre Dame in 1987 and 1991. Career Schrader began her teaching and academic career at Notre Dame during the early 1980s. She worked as a summer engineering intern for McDonnell Douglas Astronautics in 1982, 1983, and 1984. During the early 1990s, she also consulted for Chimera Research while continuing to teach at Notre Dame. After briefly teaching at Rice University during 1991, she became a tenured professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio and served as associate dean. She was president of the IEEE Control Systems Society in 2003. In 2005 she became professor and dean of the College of Engineering at Boise State University. In January 2011 she left the dean position and became associate vice president for strategic research initiatives in Boise State's Division of Research and Economic Development. In 2012 she took the position of chancellor at Missouri University of Science and Technology, which she held until her Wright State University presidency was announced in 2017. Awards and honors In 2005, Schrader received the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring from the White House. She was honored as one of the 2005 \\"Idaho Women Making History\\" by the Gender Equity Center at Boise State University. She received the IEEE Education Society Hewlett-Packard/Harriett B. Rigas Award in 2016.Hewlett-Packard/Harriett B. Rigas Award recipients, IEEE. Accessed May 15, 2016 For 2014, she was selected as an IEEE Fellow \\"for leadership and contributions in engineering education.\\" Federal investigation On May 21, 2014, during Schrader's tenure as chancellor of Missouri S&T;, the U.S. Department of Education launched a probe of the university for potential Title IX violations over their handling of sexual violence cases. Missouri S&T; was the only Missouri institution investigated at the time, and (as of 2019) remains the only public university in Missouri under investigation. The case remained open when Schrader left the university in 2017. Criticism of her leadership at Missouri S&T; led to an effort to hold a vote of no confidence against her, which she acknowledged after accepting the Wright State presidency. It was reported that the Wright State University board of trustees was unaware that Schrader had \\"stared down a no-confidence effort\\" when she was hired, although the board chairman said he was \\"not concerned\\". Wright State University presidency Schrader entered the position of President of Wright State on July 1, 2017, after a time of financial and political turmoil at the school. Years of overspending had drained the reserve funds. The university budget had already been cut by some $30 million by the board of trustees and the interim president before her arrival. According to Schrader, \\"the bulk of the budget cuts were supposed to have been completed\\" before she took over, but she faced further financial problems. By the end of her first year, she had implemented close to another $20 million more in cuts while producing a \\"projected\\" surplus of some $7 million, the first operating surplus since 2012. This earned her praise in her first annual review. However, controversy arose when the university released a statement implying she had declined to accept an annual raise or bonus, when in fact neither had been offered. The budget modifications did ultimately avoid a state fiscal watch, which had been considered likely in 2017 when she became president. Schrader's approach to the university budget, as well as her general leadership during the first year were not without criticism. One member of the Wright State University Board of Trustees called her proposed 2019 fiscal year budget \\"a recipe for disaster.\\" Schrader's strategic plan for the university, which had been specifically requested to be \\"different than anybody would see at another university,\\" received criticism for being \\"overly broad\\" and \\"generic.\\" Relations between the administration and faculty, which were already strained by the financial difficulties, deteriorated early in Schrader's presidency. Members of the Wright State Chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) were particularly strident in their criticism of the handling of the budget. In November 2017, the Wright State AAUP chapter president remarked that the relationship with the administration was no longer \\"cordial.\\" A major issue was the employment contract: the faculty had been working without one since June 2017. The union argued that the austerity measures in the contract being imposed by the administration were harmful to the students and to the educational mission of the institution, and that the faculty was being forced to bear a disproportionate burden of the financial crisis even though it had been brought by the administration. Tensions publicly erupted after a closed-door negotiating session in January 2018 when hundreds of faculty and students marched across campus to an open budget forum hosted by Schrader. More protests followed. At a February demonstration, a professor characterized the budget modifications as a \\"budget-cutting spree\\" that protects \\"extreme salaries and bloat of the upper administration\\" and \\"slashes\\" the core mission of the university. Some students also expressed concern about the impact the cuts would have on their studies. =Faculty contract dispute= Frustration mounted as the university entered the second fiscal year under Schrader's leadership without a faculty contract, even though both the administration and the faculty union acknowledged that the contract dispute was only one of many problems the university was facing. The administration insisted that the austerity measures in the contract were necessary, but the faculty union argued that the employment terms took power from the faculty and gave it to the administration, particularly in the areas of workload and imposed furloughs. Another issue was the right to collective bargaining, specifically, over health care. The faculty union also said that the reduction in benefits would amount to a nine percent pay cut. Talk of a strike, which had begun in January 2017 became more earnest in July. The faculty union maintained it would only strike if the president and board tried to \\"impose a contract that would damage education at Wright State.\\" The blame for the contract dispute shifted from the Board of Trustees and the former Wright State president to Schrader herself. Several hundred faculty protested the stalled contract negotiations at the October 19 meeting of the Wright State Board of Trustees. In November, some faculty members called for an expedited vote of \\"no- confidence\\" on Schrader. The faculty senate, however, voted against proceeding. The board president supported Schrader in the face of the no- confidence vote, while the faculty senate president said \\"morale is the lowest I can remember it being\\" after the senate's decision. A decline in morale among adjunct faculty was also indicated. On January 4, 2019, the trustees voted to implement a \\"last, best offer\\" it had extended and the faculty uniton had rejected in November 2018, effectively imposing the rejected contract onto the faculty. In response, the faculty union announced a plan to strike on January 22. In a January 6 statement, Schrader described the employment terms as \\"fair\\" and said \\"we can return to the bargaining table when the university is back on solid financial footing.\\" As the strike date drew closer, the faculty union maintained its willingness to negotiate and avoid a strike, and blamed Schrader personally for the impasse. Schrader stood firm in her support of the employment terms and the Board of Trustees. In a January 17 statement, Schrader said that renegotiation of the expired contract was \\"not possible.\\" The faculty union argued that continuing to work under the imposed terms was tantamount to accepting the imposed contract, which would diminish the future bargaining power of the faculty union. =Faculty strike= On January 22, 2019, following almost two years of failed contract negotiations and an unexpected imposition of employment conditions by the administration, the Wright State chapter of the American Association of University Professors began a strike that would ultimately become the second-longest public university strike in U.S. history. The strike received national attention. On February 10, day 20 of the strike, after a long weekend of negotiating, the faculty union and the administration negotiators reached a tentative agreement to end the strike. The faculty returned to work on Monday February 11. \\"Both parties made substantial concessions to help move the university forward together,\\" Schrader said. The faculty union admitted it made some \\"serious financial concessions,\\" such as agreeing to no pay raises until 2021, but kept protections on job security, workload, merit pay, and perhaps most significantly, the right to bargain over health care. On the whole, the faculty union hailed the agreement and considered the strike a success. Personal life Schrader is married to practicing attorney Jeff Schrader, who served as chief legal counsel for the Idaho State Board of Education. They have two children.

The Colorsport partnership was set up in the late 1960s by photographers Colin Elsey and Stewart Fraser, and they were soon joined by Andrew Cowie. The agency ‚Äì as its name suggests - was among the earliest to cover sport in colour as well as black and white, especially football, rugby union and the Olympics. History The business was established in the late 1960s when two sports photographers, Colin Elsey and Stewart Fraser, started to work together. They were initially based in Kings Cross before the business became established at St Peter‚Äôs Street in Islington for many years as it continued to expand. During that time Colorsport was the official photographer for the Rugby Football Union and Arsenal Football Club, as well as many sporting publications. In 2003 the business, which had moved to Crouch End, lost Colin Elsey who died suddenly. At around the same time Stewart Fraser retired. Colorsport gained new owners in late 2005, notably Nigel Wray, the owner of Saracens rugby club, and David Norrie, a former editor of Rugby World magazine and cricket and rugby correspondent of the News of the World, who became chairman. The business was moved to extensive new head offices in Surrey. Andrew Cowie, who joined the business in 1972, is still active as a sports photographer and also now heads up Colorsport's library operations. James Pinniger joined as Chief Executive at the start of 2009 from Reuters. Since that time Colorsport has revamped their online presence and developed a network of international partners. Colorsport photographers were nominated in two categories at the 2012 SJA British Sport Photography Awards, while Cowie's shot of Tony Woodcock's try for the All Blacks in the 2011 Rugby World Cup Final was voted the Sports Picture of the Year at the 2012 NAPA Awards. The Archive Colorsport Images has acquired a number of older photo archives, principally the Albert Wilkes Collection, The Provincial Press Archive, and the Barrett Collection. Colorsport has digitised these collections, enabling online distribution. They now operate a large commercial website which allows clients to search and browse for images, purchase usage rights and download images, in addition to a separate website that enables selected images from the archive to be ordered as consumer prints. The Wilkes Collection, which contains many thousands of glass plates (mainly football and cricket), had been set up in the 1890s by Albert Wilkes, who played football for Aston Villa and England. Wilkes, and later his son, ran the business from West Bromwich for over sixty years. Provincial Press had been based in Southport from the 1940s through to the 1970s, covering many FA Cup Finals, including the 1953 Matthews Final, as well as having contracts with Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle United and Arsenal football clubs among others. Photographers Colin Elsey‚Äôs reputation as one of rugby union's leading photographer was established with his work on the all-conquering 1974 British Lions tour to South Africa and confirmed on the next Lions tour to New Zealand three years later when he took the iconic ‚ÄúMudman‚Äù image of Fran Cotton peering out of the Wellington mud, considered by many to be among the greatest rugby photos ever taken. Stewart Fraser, a winner of the 1967 World Press Photo sports award, became a specialist in covering winter and summer Olympic sports. Andrew Cowie took up the mantle as Colorsport's soccer specialist - in 2010 in South Africa he covered his eighth World Cup for the company. Several other distinguished photographers learnt their trade and came through the Colorsport ranks, such as Stuart McFarlane and Matthew Impey. Current Colorsport photographers include Dan Rowley, Ian MacNicol, and Shaun Boggust.

Blueprints sent along with the petition were modeled very similarly to the Carnegie building constructed one year earlier in Albany, Georgia. On March 24, 1906 Andrew Carnegie accepted the request and gave the town of Montezuma $10,000 for construction of the building. This came with the stipulation that the town pay an annual upkeep and maintenance fee of $1,000 per year to keep the building in good condition. Construction began later that year with help from Masons across Georgia. By 1923 this library was seeing a circulation amount of 12,453 books per year, and the $1,000 annual cost of upkeep was still being administered per Carnegie's request.

The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \\"real world\\" town by a powerful curse. In this episode, Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) is asked by Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito) for help uncovering evidence that could expose Regina's (Lana Parrilla) corrupt ways in Storybrooke, while in the Enchanted Forest, Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) father King Leopold (Richard Schiff) is granted three wishes by a Genie (Esposito), which details the back story of the Magic Mirror's origins. It was co-written by Andrew Chambliss and Ian B. Goldberg, while being directed by Bryan Spicer. Plot =Opening sequence= The Genie appears in the Enchanted Forest. =In the characters' past= In The Enchanted Forest, King Leopold (Richard Schiff) finds a lamp and releases the Genie (Giancarlo Esposito) living inside, who grants the King three wishes. Having nothing more that he could want, the King uses his first wish to free the Genie and then uses his second wish to give away his third wish to the Genie. The King brings the Genie back to his castle and introduces him to Snow (Ginnifer Goodwin) and the Queen (Lana Parrilla). When the Genie meets the latter, he is enamored. At his birthday party, the King declares Snow the greatest gift and the fairest in the land. The Queen departs, feeling rejected, but the Genie follows her out and gives her a mirror which lets her see herself as he sees her; as the fairest of all. The King finds the mirror and the Queen's diary revealing feelings for the man who gave it to her. He commands the Genie to find this man who has stolen the Queen's heart. As the Genie wonders what to do, the Queen's father, Henry (Tony Perez), shows up and gives him a box. Henry claims the contents will free his daughter. The Genie brings the box to his beloved Queen and they find deadly snakes from the Genie's home country. The Queen wants to free herself from her loveless marriage by suicide via the snake's venom. The Genie stops her and offers an alternative, a plot to kill the King. He sets the snakes upon the King in his bed which startles him awake. As the venom takes hold, the Genie confesses to giving the Queen the mirror as a token of his love and begs forgiveness. The King responds by saying that the Genie was right, he should have never made a wish. Then, the Genie informs the Queen her husband is dead and they can be together at last. The Queen reveals it was her plan all along to have the Genie kill the King, even using snakes that would be traced to him. The Genie, stung by this betrayal, uses his wish: to stay at the Queen's side and look upon her face always. He finds himself trapped in the mirror, becoming the Magic Mirror. The Queen notes that he did get his wish. =In Storybrooke= In Storybrooke, the storm from the previous episode has wrecked Henry's (Jared S. Gilmore) castle so he checks the sand underneath to be sure his book is still there. He tells Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) it's their secret, but Regina Mills (Parrilla) finds him and plans to clear the castle away on the ground that it is a safety hazard. At Granny's, Sidney Glass (Esposito) approaches Emma to tell her Regina fired him from the paper and embezzled $50,000 of town funds. He needs her help to expose the mayor's corruption. When Henry discovers his book is missing after the castle is torn down, Emma agrees to help. Sidney and Emma follow Regina into the woods but Emma loses control when her brakes fail. They run into Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) who admits to selling Regina a plot of land. Emma and Sidney break into the mayor's house to find out what the land is for and they discover a plan for a building. Sidney also finds photos of Henry with Emma, concluding Regina had her followed. At a city council meeting, Emma shows the files to the whole town and accuses Regina of building a second home in the woods. Regina, unfazed, unveils her plans to build a new playground for Henry and all the children in Storybrooke. She goes on to warn Emma that if she continues to see Henry, she will file a restraining order. A victorious Regina congratulates her accomplice, Sidney, for convincing Emma he is an ally and for cutting her brakes. She tells Sidney she doesn't know what she'd do without him. After his book is lost in the tear down, Henry sits at Granny's and tries to write the stories down so he doesn't forget. The Stranger (Eion Bailey) questions him about what he's doing and Henry asks the same question back. Henry does not realize it is the Stranger who has his book. Production \\"Fruit of the Poisonous Tree\\" was co-written by co-producers Ian B. Goldberg and Andrew Chambliss, while 24 veteran, Bryan Spicer, directed the installment. Cultural references The episode contains a reference to the collection of short stories, One Thousand and One Nights, with the line, \\"In my time I have granted a thousand and one wishes and I have seen them end poorly a thousand and one times.\\" Reception =Ratings= This episode saw an increase from the previous episode, scoring a 3.5/9 among 18-49s and a 5.9/10 overall, with 10.91 million viewers tuning in. It was also the most watched episode in eleven weeks. In Canada, the episode finished in ninth place for the week with an estimated 1.58 million viewers. =Reviews= Reviews for the episode were mixed. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave it a B, noting, \\"What sets this episode apart from the last 10 is that we finally get some real emotion and motivation from Regina. For someone that doesn‚Äôt want to be thought of as a villain, Regina is a raging bitch all of the time, but we finally see her softer side come out in the fairyback in an instance that isn‚Äôt patricide.\\" He also praised recurring actor Giancarlo Esposito's performance, noting \\"Anyone who has watched the last three seasons of Breaking Bad knows what a remarkable actor Giancarlo Esposito is, so it‚Äôs not that big of a surprise that his first spotlight episode of Once Upon A Time is a highlight of the series.\\" IGN columnist Amy Ratcliffe reviewed the episode far less favourably, rating it a \\"mediocre\\" 5/10 and noting that \\"the idea that the genie fell for another man's wife and tragically became the Mirror had a lot of potential, but was torpedoed by a script that was going through the motions.\\" Laura Prudom of The Huffington Post felt that her \\"main problem with this episode was that, by the end, we were right back to where we started narratively, with nothing having truly developed,\\" a sentiment shared by Ratcliffe.

The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \\"real world\\" town by a powerful curse. In this episode, Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) suspects Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) of planning to seek vigilante justice when a cat burglar, Moe French (Eric Keenleyside), robs his house. Meanwhile, Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) plans a special girls' night out on Valentine's Day with Ruby (Meghan Ory) and Ashley (Jessy Schram). In the Enchanted Forest flashbacks, a fateful deal is made between Rumpelstiltskin (Carlyle) and Belle (Emilie de Ravin), in which she gives up her freedom to save her village from the horrors of the Ogre Wars. The episode was written by consulting producer Jane Espenson and directed by Milan Cheylov. It featured the first appearance of de Ravin, who was cast as Belle in November 2011 after being approached by series co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Espenson created a love- themed episode; initially its main theme was to be Rumpelstiltskin choosing power over love, but during the writing process Espenson decided instead to make the character believe that he was not worthy of love at all. \\"Skin Deep\\" first aired in the United States on ABC on February 12, 2012. A novelization of \\"Skin Deep\\" was released in 2013. Plot =Opening sequence= A straw spinning wheel is shown in the forest. =In the characters' past= In the Enchanted Forest, the Ogre Wars are not going well for the lands controlled by Sir Maurice (Eric Keenleyside). Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle) is summoned and agrees to aid the battle in exchange for Maurice's daughter, Belle (Emilie de Ravin) to live at his estate as his caretaker. Belle's fianc√©e, Gaston (Sage Brocklebank), and her father reject the terms, but Belle goes against both their wishes and accepts the deal. At his castle, Rumplestiltskin gives Belle a list of tasks, including \\"skinning the children he hunts for their pelts.\\" At this, Belle drops a teacup in shock, but he explains that it is a joke and is dismissive instead of angry about the now-chipped cup. As time goes by, Rumplestiltskin and Belle develop a bond. After a few months living with him, Belle asks the Dark One about some children's clothing she found in one of the castle's many rooms. Rumplestiltskin says it belonged to his son whom he lost along with his wife. Later, Gaston arrives to fight Rumplestiltskin to get Belle back, but Rumplestiltskin transfigures him into a rose, which he gifts to Belle. When Rumplestiltskin later asks about her relationship with Gaston, Belle says that it was an arranged marriage, not one of love. She adds that she left her home to live with him because she wanted to be heroic by saving her village, as there are not many opportunities for women back in her village. At this, Rumplestiltskin carefully asks Belle to go into town to buy straw for his spinning. When she expresses disbelief that he trusts her to come back, Rumplestiltskin (uncharacteristically somber) says that he does not expect to see her again. As Belle walks down the road towards her village, she encounters the Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla), who asks her if she is running from someone. Belle admits the man she is leaving is consumed by evil, yet she still loves him. The Evil Queen offers the solution: true love's kiss will break the curse. Belle returns to Rumplestiltskin's castle, where the Dark One initially feigns nonchalance but then asks why she came back to him. She replies that she wasn't going to return, but something changed her mind. After a moment of silence between the two, they share a true love's kiss. The magic starts to turn him back into an ordinary man (shown through a change in the pallor of his skin), but he becomes furious and breaks off the kiss, accusing Belle of conspiring with the Evil Queen to rob him of his powers. Rumplestiltskin rages that no one will ever love him, and the Evil Queen will never be able to take away his power. He throws Belle in his dungeon and begins destroying all of his breakable possessions, but even in his anger he cannot bring himself to destroy the chipped teacup. Finally, he orders Belle to leave his castle, claiming that his magic is more important to him than she is. Belle refuses to believe this and admonishes him for being too cowardly to believe that she can love him. She warns him that he will regret his actions, and all he'll have is an empty heart - and a chipped cup. A month later, the Evil Queen pays a visit to the Dark Castle. Rumplestiltskin informs her that her deception with Belle failed, and that the Evil Queen will never be more powerful than him. The Evil Queen counters that she had nothing to do with Belle's actions (although she prodded her into trying true love's kiss, Belle's feelings for him were genuine). She then lies to him that upon Belle's return home, she was shunned by her village for her association with Rumplestiltskin and Gaston's disappearance (which is Rumplestiltskin's fault). According to the Evil Queen, Belle was subsequently imprisoned and tortured by her father, leading her to commit suicide by jumping from her tower prison. Rumplestiltskin is devastated, and the loss leads him to remove a treasured gold chalice from its display pedestal, replacing it with the chipped cup. He mourns his loss upon the Evil Queen's departure. =In Storybrooke= In the present day, Mr. Gold (Carlyle) repossesses florist Moe French's (Keenleyside) van the day before Valentine's Day. At Granny's, David (Josh Dallas) and Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) talk from separate tables, until Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) interrupts to ask after her son Henry (Jared S. Gilmore). Ashley (Jessy Schram) arrives with her baby, noting how rarely she gets a babysitter or sees her boyfriend, Sean (Tim Phillipps). Ruby (Meghan Ory) suggests a girl's night out. Emma investigates a robbery at Mr. Gold's mansion. Gold claims to know that Moe is responsible. Following this lead, Emma recovers the majority of Mr. Gold's items, but one unspecified item is missing and Gold will stop at nothing until it is recovered. When Emma takes too long for his taste, Gold takes matters into his own hands. He kidnaps Moe, ties him up in an abandoned shack on the edge of town, and beats him up, demanding where the missing object is and who told the florist to take it. However, his rant about the theft soon devolves into simply \\"she's gone\\" (referring to Belle, whose \\"suicide\\" Gold blames Moe for), until Emma arrives to stop him. Mr. Gold believes Regina (Lana Parrilla) put Moe up to the theft, and that she knows where the last stolen item is. Emma has to arrest Mr. Gold for assault. In a Storybrooke bar, at their girls' night out, Ruby is trying to convince Ashley to find another guy since Sean is always working. Ashley tells Mary Margaret that all she wants is to be with Sean. Mary Margaret understands, since her own romantic arrangement is not ideal. Sean shows up, on a break between work shifts, and proposes to Ashley; she eagerly accepts and they go out for a drive together. David shows up next to give Mary Margaret her Valentine's Day card, but mistakenly gives her Kathryn's. Mary Margaret says she thought if two people were meant to be together they would find a way, but maybe she and David need another way. She tells him he should probably go home. At the sheriff's office, Mr. Gold reminds Emma about the favor she owes him, but unexpectedly does not use it to request his freedom. Regina shows up and tells Emma that she can see Henry for 30 minutes if Emma will allow her to pay a private visit to Mr. Gold during that time. Once alone, Gold asks Regina if she has what he wants and she claims she does. Regina put Moe up to the robbery in order to find out if Mr. Gold retains his Enchanted Forest memories. After some prodding, he admits that his true name is Rumpelstiltskin and addresses Regina as \\"Your Majesty,\\" confirming that both are aware of their former fairy-tale identities. Regina returns the chipped cup to Mr. Gold as part, then makes a visit to the hospital. We see an unmarked cell in the underground psychiatric ward that holds Belle, who did not commit suicide in the Enchanted Forest as the Evil Queen claimed, but is in fact being held prisoner by Regina in the hospital's mental ward. Production Emilie de Ravin, who portrayed Belle, described her character as someone who would \\"do anything basically for her father, but also her friends and family in general, and that‚Äôs what she does. She has this chance where she‚Äôs always wanted to be brave and make a change and do something different and not just sit around in the confinement of her castle and her simple life.\\" \\"Skin Deep\\" was written by consulting producer Jane Espenson, while 24 veteran, Milan Cheylov, directed the installment. Knowing that they were going to recreate the story of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", series co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz wanted its heroine, Belle, \\"to exude intelligence and strength and be someone you would immediately love,\\" which led them to approach Emilie de Ravin. Her casting was announced in November 2011. The actress agreed after reading the script, believing that the character was \\"very courageous\\" with a playful side that would endear her to Rumpelstiltskin. During their casting meeting, Kitsis and Horowitz told de Ravin that Belle is defined as a strong intelligent woman in a world that disapproves of those characteristics, and that de Ravin was going to be \\"tak[ing] the icon of Belle and mak[ing] her a woman.\\" Espenson said that this was one of their most love-centered episodes; when they realized it was going to be airing near Valentine's Day, they decided to \\"lean into\\" this theme. Unusually for Once Upon a Time, the theme of this episode changed during the writing process. It was initially meant to center on Rumpelstiltskin choosing power over love. However, as Espenson went through drafts and discussed them with others, she decided that Rumpelstiltskin might think he is choosing power over love, but in reality his actions are motivated by a belief that he is worthy of love at all. In the interest of time, Espenson was forced to edit out many plot points, including a failed escape attempt by Belle. Despite this, she sought to trim down more time from the Storybrooke scenes and \\"preserve as much as we could of the fairy tale side,\\" as the Belle- Rumpelstiltskin relationship was a love story that needed time to grow in order to be believable. De Ravin was a fan of the series before being cast and was happy to be able to view the costumes up close, describing her character's gold dress as \\"absolutely stunning.\\" The casting of her former suitor, Gaston, was announced in December 2011 with Psych actor Sage Brocklebank. De Ravin described the episode's version of Gaston as \\"maybe not as cocky as the animation [version of him], but it‚Äôs funny.\\" Rumpelstiltskin's castle was shot almost entirely on greenscreen, with only a few real props being used. It was de Ravin's first time working with this technology, which caused her to become \\"quite nervous.\\" The physical props helped her with the scenes, and \\"they ha[d] a fantastic set up of a couple of monitors that you can see a markup of basically how it‚Äôs going to look.\\" The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale ‚Äì a novelization of the first season ‚Äì which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013. Cultural references There are multiple references made to Disney's Beauty and the Beast. The chipped tea cup that Belle accidentally drops is a reference to the boy-transformed-teacup Chip from the animated film. Also, Rumplestiltskin was referred to as a \\"beast\\" by Belle's father. Belle's fianc√©e in the show is named Gaston, the Disney antagonist, and he was turned into a red rose, which featured prominently in the film. In addition, most of Belle's clothing in the fantasy world appears to be directly inspired by the Disney film, such as her classic yellow ballgown and her blue-and-white plainclothes. Mr. French's flower shop is called \\"Game of Thorns,\\" a reference to Game of Thrones, a popular fantasy show and book series. The name and a logo can be seen on the side of his van at the start of the episode. David is seen reading Anna Karenina, another story about an affair that ends tragically. In the end of the episode, a reference to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is shown, when Regina meets a nurse, who looks like Nurse Ratchet and the janitor mopping the floor, a striking resemblance to the Chief in the novel and film adaptation. Reception =Ratings= Ratings and viewership for \\"Skin Deep\\" were down from the last episode. It had an 18-49 rating of 3.0 and was seen by 8.65 million viewers, down 14 percent, but still came in second overall for the night. This was partially due to the fact that the episode aired in the same time-slot as the 54th Grammy Awards, who had their best numbers ever since the 1984 telecast and the sudden news of Whitney Houston's death the day prior to the event. In Canada, the episode finished in sixteenth place for the week with an estimated 1.55 million viewers, a slight decrease from the 1.58 million of the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"Skin Deep\\" received mixed reviews from television critics. Amy Ratcliffe, writing for IGN, rated the episode with an 8 out of 10. She expressed her love of Robert Carlyle, opining that \\"I especially liked him in the episode. He managed to show true emotion in spite of his silly Rumpelstiltskin accent, and he improves every scene he's in. I feel like this episode will start something bigger. At least, I hope it will.\\" Laura Prudom of The Huffington Post felt Espenson was a \\"perfect fit for this episode ‚Äì when she's firing on all cylinders, the Buffy alumna is one of the best in the industry at writing layered, empowered women, even when circumstances conspire against them.\\" '' Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly opined that Espenson's attempt to tell a \\"nightmarish, twisty tale of obsession and loss\\" was \\"decidedly mixed\\" due to the lack of development in the relationship between Belle and Rumpelstiltskin. Busis explained, \\"Yes, people fall in love quickly in traditional bedtime stories. But at least in the animated version of Beauty and the Beast, we could understand why Belle and her hairy paramour were meant to be. 'Skin Deep' didn't bother to explain that attraction.\\" In a contribution for Tor.com, Teresa Jusino defined \\"Skin Deep\\" as an \\"amazing retelling of the Beauty and the Beast story that contained some wonderful character moments and some great one-liners... Funny, charming, and at times harrowing, the script takes us into the depths of Rumpelstiltskin‚Äôs soul, showing us this character both at his most warm and at his most dark.\\" Jusino was critical of the subplot with David and Mary Margaret, however, saying that \\"it didn‚Äôt seem necessary as it didn‚Äôt really move much forward.\\" References External links * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Once Upon a Time (season 1) episodes Category:Television episodes written by Jane Espenson Category:Works based on Beauty and the Beast ","title":"Skin Deep (Once Upon a Time)"},{"id":"34475303","text":"The John Wright Mansion is a historic farmhouse located east of Bellevue in northwestern Huron County, Ohio, United States.

The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \\"real world\\" town by a powerful curse. In this episode, David (Josh Dallas) finds his love for Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) growing stronger and finally agrees to end his loveless marriage with Kathryn (Anastasia Griffith) by telling her about his secret relationship, and Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) becomes more intrigued with The Stranger (Eion Bailey), while Prince James (Dallas) is asked by Abigail (Griffith) to recover something precious that was lost to her. It was written by David H. Goodman and was directed by Dean White. Plot =Opening sequence= A golden, lifeless statue of a man under a gazebo is shown in the forest. =In the characters' past= In the Enchanted Forest, King George's (Alan Dale) men hunt for Prince James (Josh Dallas) who has fled his wedding to Princess Abigail (Anastasia Griffith). James narrowly escapes, with Abigail's help. When he asks why she would do this, Abigail tells James she does not want this arranged marriage any more than he does. She takes him to a monument containing a life-sized, golden statue of Frederick, the man she loves. During an ambush, he had tried to protect her father, King Midas, but had accidentally touched him and been transformed to gold by Midas' curse. Abigail explains that there is a lake with waters reported to have enough magic to restore Frederick, but no man has come back from that lake alive. James agrees to risk it because if he succeeds, Abigail's suffering will end, but if he fails, his own suffering will end. Abigail takes James to the lake and shows him a shrine where others have left offerings to appease the creature within. She offers to accompany him, but James tells her he will go on alone since he does not want any life in his hands but his own. He commands the beast to show itself and is answered by a beautiful siren (or, more probably, a rusalka). Even though James knows the deceptive nature of the siren, she transforms into the image of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and attempts to seduce him. It takes all his will to refuse the temptress so she tries to drown him by force. James manages to cut himself free and pick up a dagger to kill the Siren. He returns to Abigail victorious and the water restores Frederick (Greyston Holt) to life. The reunited lovers are overjoyed and grateful. James is inspired to carry on his quest to find his love, Snow White. He meets Red Riding Hood (Meghan Ory), who informs him that Snow White left to look for him and tell him she loves him. James realizes King George forced Snow White to tell him she doesn't love him. With the King's men closing in on James, he pulls Red Riding Hood up on his horse and the two escape. =In Storybrooke= In the present day, Kathryn (Griffith) tells David (Dallas) she has been accepted at a law school in Boston. She figures they could use a fresh start, but David only replies that he needs to take a walk, leaving out the fact that he is taking this walk with Mary Margaret (Goodwin). He tells Mary Margaret that he chooses her over his wife and is not going to leave Storybrooke. Mary Margaret insists he must tell Kathryn the truth and let her go to Boston alone. David attempts to do this but instead makes up an excuse about not reconnecting as he breaks up with Kathryn. She is devastated, but remains unaware that there is another woman involved. Later on, Kathryn stops by Regina's (Lana Parrilla) home, where she tells the Mayor about David leaving her. Regina shows photographic evidence to Kathryn about David and Mary Margaret's affair. Meanwhile, David lies to Mary Margaret he told Kathryn about them. Soon after, Kathryn visits and slaps Mary Margaret in the middle of the school hallway and tells the confused teacher that David lied to them both. Later, Mary Margaret notices people are avoiding her and whispering behind her back, including Granny (Beverly Elliot) who tells her she should be ashamed of herself, revealing that the news of her affair had spread around the town. She asks David why he never told Kathryn the truth, to which he replies that he didn't want anyone to get hurt. She tells him that they do not have love but something destructive that must stop, so she breaks up with him. The Stranger (Eion Bailey) tells Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) his name is August Wayne Booth. He tells her to meet him outside of Granny's after work. In the meantime, August is restoring Henry's book, handling the pages in a darkroom, applying a chemical, hanging them up to dry, then assembling the book anew. At the end of the day, August and Emma meet and he takes her to an old well for a drink of water. August explains to a confused Emma that the well is supposed to have restorative qualities and will restore what was lost. Hours later, as Emma starts brushing leaves off her car, she finds the red metal box that holds Henry's (Jared S. Gilmore) book, while August secretly watches her. Elsewhere, Kathryn goes to see Regina again, this time to apologize for what she said. Kathryn admits that she was never in love with David, and that she is moving to Boston alone. Kathryn adds that she wrote letters to both David and Mary Margaret telling them to be together, as they looked happy in the pictures. Insistent on preventing this act of forgiveness from becoming known, Regina steals the letter addressed to David and burns it. Later, Emma returns the book to Henry, who believes that its discovery is a sign that things will change for the better. Kathryn sets off in her car for Boston, however, as per Henry's warning about people trying to leave the town, her car winds up in a ditch. It is discovered by the school gym teacher (who was Frederick (Holt) in the Enchanted Forest), however, Kathryn is not in the crashed car; she is missing.

The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \\"real world\\" town by a powerful curse. This episode centers on Leroy and his fairytale counterpart, \\"Dreamy\\", one of Snow White's seven dwarfs. It was co-written by Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, while being directed by David Solomon. Plot =Opening sequence= The seven dwarves are shown walking in a line in the forest. =In the characters' past= In the Enchanted Forest, a clumsy fairy, Nova (Amy Acker), dreams of becoming a fairy godmother and escaping her day job: fairy dust carrier. When she begins her trip, a bit of dust falls onto the egg of a dwarf. As a result, the dwarf is born early, and seems different from his brothers. He is given a magic ax that names him Dreamy (Lee Arenberg). His seven brothers are Stealthy (Geoff Gustafson), Doc, Dopey, Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy, and Bashful. A year later, Nova is still collecting fairy dust made in the mines of the dwarves, when Dreamy recognizes her. He claims to have seen her in his dreams right before he hatched. After Nova accidentally places a bag of fairy dust on a conveyor leading to an incinerator, Dreamy saves it and becomes her \\"hero.\\" Nova mentions that she is going to watch the fireflies hoping Dreamy will get that it is an invitation for him but he doesn't. Even though he is told dwarves don't love (that's why they don't have any female dwarves), he is convinced by Belle (Emilie de Ravin) in a bar that he should meet with Nova. Dreamy really is in love, and Nova falls for him too. Together they make plans to run away and see the world, but this plan is thwarted when the Blue Fairy (Keegan Connor Tracy) shows up. She convinces Dreamy that the best thing for Nova would be if she didn't date Dreamy anymore. She explains that if Dreamy and Nova go off together, \\"it will not end well\\" and Nova will lose her wings. In the interest of saving Nova's dream and her wings, Dreamy is forced to leave her. He returns to the mine heartbroken, proclaiming, \\"Where's my ax?\\" Welcomed back by the Dwarves, but still distraught over having to end his relation with Nova, he strikes the rock in rage, breaking his ax. He is given a new one which renames him Grumpy, due to his rage from his breakup with Nova. =In Storybrooke= Storybrooke is celebrating the Miner's Festival and Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) attempts to bank some good will by selling candles made by the nuns. She asks Leroy (Arenberg) to volunteer, but he retorts that she is the only person the town dislikes more than him. His attitude changes after Sister Astrid (Acker) spills glitter on him. When Astrid tells Leroy she accidentally spent all her stipend on helium, he vows to sell all her candles to make up the money the nuns need for rent. Mary Margaret realizes Leroy is in love with Astrid who, as a nun, is unavailable. Leroy reminds her she is no better and the two team up to start selling. Unfortunately, Leroy was quite right about how unpopular they are. Leroy is unable to tell Astrid that he let her down and comes up with a new plan. He offers to sell his boat to Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) in exchange for forgiving the nuns the rent. Gold declines when he learns it is for the nuns, whom he fiercely dislikes. Astrid finds out none of the candles were sold. Desperate and near defeat, Leroy and Mary Margaret share a drink at Granny's. Leroy has one last idea; he breaks the power transformer for the whole town, causing a blackout. This forces everyone to buy candles and the stock is sold out. Leroy is restored as Astrid's hero. While the word \\"TRAMP\\" is still visible on Mary Margaret's truck, the town, including Granny, seems to accept her again. Meanwhile, Sheriff Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) investigates the disappearance of Kathryn Nolan and the first person she must question is her husband, David (Josh Dallas). David claims he did not speak to Kathryn the previous day and he presumed she had left for Boston as planned. Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito), hoping to get a story and his position at the newspaper back, offers to help Emma. Regina (Lana Parrilla) receives a fax and calls Sidney to inform him she has the phone records. He brings Emma the records that show David did in fact speak to Kathryn the day she vanished. Emma has a hard time believing David lied but Sidney insists the evidence is irrefutable.

In Canada, the episode finished in sixteenth place for the week with an estimated 1.44 million viewers, a slight decrease from the 1.497 million of the previous episode. =Reviews= The episode was met with mixed reviews. Lily Sparks of TV.com gave the episode a negative review and wrote, \\"Okay, I'm about to hit you with some truth: last night's episode of 'Once Upon a Time,' 'Dreamy,' was the worst this show had ever been. The opening was a siege of nightmarish information, including the revelations that there are no dwarf women and the permanently old dwarf men reproduce asexually by hatching out of eggs FULLY CLOTHED. And the horrible romance! Grumpy and Nova the 'clumsy fairy' were seriously bizarre characters, they both talked like six year olds and now I feel like I've condescended to six year olds, because even six year olds aren't this simplistic and idiotic.Once Upon a Time: Rotten Dwarf Eggs Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly complained, \\"I think the writers of 'Once' have seen Disney's version of Aida one too many times. On this show, every story's a love story ... 'Once' has dipped into the 'star-crossed lovers' well a few times too many.\\" Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B\\" and said, \\"'Once Upon A Time' has gone from exceedingly mediocre to downright serviceable in the second half of the season, but it remains a problematic series, struggling to balance its two different worlds. Last episode heightened the emotional stakes in Storybrooke to contrast with the swashbuckling fairyback, but 'Dreamy' goes back to the more obvious storytelling of the season‚Äôs early episodes, hammering its theme like a high- budget children‚Äôs show. That‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing, and if this show wanted to be live-action Disney mash-up that would be fine, but unfortunately, it has this whole missing person/potential murder subplot that brings it into more mature territory.\\"Once Upon a Time: Dreamy References External links * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Once Upon a Time (season 1) episodes ","title":"Dreamy (Once Upon a Time)"},{"id":"34475311","text":"\\"Hat Trick\\" is the 17th episode of the American fairy tale/drama television series Once Upon a Time, which aired in the United States on ABC on March 25, 2012. The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \\"real world\\" town by a powerful curse. This episode centers on Jefferson (Sebastian Stan) and his fairytale counterpart, the Mad Hatter. It was co-written by David H. Goodman and Vladimir Cvetko, while Ralph Hemecker directed the episode. Plot =Opening sequence= Large mushrooms are seen in the forest. =In Storybrooke= Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) and Sheriff Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) return to the sheriff's office to see Henry Mills (Jared S. Gilmore) sitting there. He quietly congratulates Emma on helping Mary Margaret Blanchard (Ginnifer Goodwin) escape, but Emma does not know what he is talking about. Mr. Gold tells Emma that Mary Margaret is no longer in her jail cell. Emma states that if it is discovered that Mary Margaret escaped, proving her innocence would be impossible and sets out to find her. Mr. Gold reminds Emma that her future is in jeopardy if she is found helping Mary Margaret. She tells him that she would rather lose her job than her friend. As Emma is driving through the woods, she nearly hits a man (Sebastian Stan). She apologizes and when she notices he is limping, she offers to drive him home. He takes up her offer and introduces himself as Jefferson. At his mansion, he gives her a map to aid her in her search and brings her tea. However, the tea makes her dizzy, and he drags her to the couch so she could rest. She notices that he is no longer limping. He admits that she caught him, revealing he poisoned the tea, and she loses consciousness. Emma wakes up bound and gagged on the couch. She crushes her teacup and uses the pieces to free herself. While sneaking around the mansion, she sees Jefferson sharpening scissors, then accidentally steps on a loose floorboard. She hides in the nearest room and finds Mary Margaret also bound and gagged. She frees Mary Margaret, who tells her that she was running through the woods and was captured by Jefferson. She explains that she found a key in her cell and used it to escape. The pair try to leave the mansion, but they are caught by Jefferson who is armed with Emma's gun. He orders Emma to tie Mary Margaret back up and gag her and tells her that he has a task for her. In the next room, he seats her at a table with a hat and some tools and tells her to make him a hat. He reveals that he remembers life in the Enchanted Forest and that he is aware of the curse. He tells her that he lived trapped in the mansion for twenty-eight years, stuck doing the same things every day. He knows that Emma refuses to believe in the curse or acknowledge the facts about Storybrooke. He orders her to make him a magical hat, and only she can do it as she brought magic to Storybrooke. He tells her he is The Mad Hatter, but he tells her that he is named Jefferson. She calls him insane for believing she has magic and for believing in magic at all. He replies that everyone wants a magical solution to their problem and everyone refuses to believe in magic. When she tries to tell him that the real world does not have magic, he scoffs and tells her that there are many worlds and some have magic, some do not, and some need it. He refuses to let her and Mary Margaret go free until Emma makes a working, magical hat. When she asks what will happen if the hat works, he answers that he will go home. Later, Emma becomes frustrated and demands to know why she is doing this. Jefferson shows her a telescope pointed at the house of a little girl. He tells her that the little girl is his daughter Grace, who is named Paige in Storybrooke. He explains that he is cursed to remember life in the Enchanted Forest and know that he does not belong in this world. He is tortured to watch Grace live a happy life with a new father. Emma asks why he does not simply reach out to her, but he says that he is not cruel enough to destroy Grace's reality and inflict on her the same awareness he has. He explains that it is hard enough to live in a land where you do not belong, but knowing it, holding conflicting realities in your head will drive anybody mad. He wants to take her home to the world where he and Grace once lived so that they can be together and she can remember who he is. Emma tells him that she knows what it is like to be separated from a child and tells him that it feels like going crazy. He tells her that he is not crazy. Emma says that if he is right, Mary Margaret is her mother and states that she would like to believe that more than anything in the world. She agrees to try and believe in magic and make his hat work. However, when his back is turned, she hits him with the telescope and frees Mary Margaret. Jefferson catches up to Emma and attacks her. While they are fighting, Emma notices a scar around his neck. Mary Margaret hits him with a croquet mallet and kicks him out the window. When Mary Margaret and Emma look down, only the hat Emma made remains. Emma finds her car and her keys outside. Mary Margaret expects to be taken back to prison, but Emma allows her to decide. When Mary Margaret does not understand, Emma explains that Mary Margaret is the only family Emma has and says that it would be better to face the trial together rather than alone. Mary Margaret willingly goes back to her cell. Hours later, Mayor Regina Mills (Parrilla) finds that Emma's car is not parked outside the sheriff's office. However, she discovers that Mary Margaret is in her cell. Mr. Gold tells Regina that his client is not seeing any visitors. As they walk out together, Regina angrily asks him why Mary Margaret has returned. He replies that Emma must be more resourceful than they had hoped she would be. Regina tells him that she only planted the key upon his suggestion and that she made a deal with him because she wanted results for herself. He assures Regina that she will get those results. Meanwhile, Emma visits Henry at his school before classes start. Paige walks by and greets Henry, prompting Emma to ask to see Henry's storybook. She finds pictures of Jefferson and his daughter Grace inside. =In the characters' past= In the Enchanted Forest, Jefferson (Stan) is frantically running through the woods and ducks behind a tree. However, he is found a moment later by his daughter, Grace (Alissa Skovbye); they are playing hide-and-seek. They happily go off to find mushrooms to sell at the market. But when they return home, they see that the carriage of the Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla) is waiting outside. Jefferson tells the frightened Grace to hide in the woods until the Queen is gone. He enters the house to find the Queen. She wants one last favor from Jefferson, offering Grace luxury for the rest of her life as a reward after Jefferson's accomplishing a deed. He refuses, stating that his job cost Grace her mother and he will not allow her to lose her father as well. He finally tells the Queen that there is nothing more important than family. The Queen agrees, and leaves. At the market the next day, Grace sets her heart on a stuffed white rabbit as it will be perfect for her tea parties. Jefferson is unable to afford the price of one silver, but tries to convince the elderly merchant to accept his eight coppers. The merchant refuses. Grace assures Jefferson that she does not need it and they leave. The merchant goes to the back of her cart, where the Magic Mirror (Giancarlo Esposito) states that she is truly cruel. The merchant is revealed to be the Evil Queen. Back at home, Jefferson has sewn a rabbit for Grace. She is delighted and adds it to her tea party guests. Jefferson is clearly troubled. He asks Grace to spend the rest of the day with the neighbors as he has work to do. She wants to go with him as she likes to work with him in the forest, but he tells her he is not going to the forest. She realizes that his work is related to the Queen's visit and she begs him to change his mind. He says that he wants her to have everything she needs. She replies that she only needs him and asks him to stay. He refuses, but promises to be home in time for the next tea party. After Grace is gone, Jefferson takes a large hat box out of his trunk. Jefferson brings his box to the Queen and has her promise that his daughter will want for nothing after he retrieves what she has lost. After she agrees, he takes a top hat out of the hat box and sets it on the floor. He spins it and the hat continues spinning until it grows into an enormous spinning portal. The Queen and Jefferson jump into it and land in a room full of different doors. He leads the Queen to a mirror. Before they step through, he explains that the hat has a rule: the number of people who go into a door must be the same number as those who come out. The two of them go through the mirror. They step into a land with very tall grass and giant mushrooms. They pass an enormous blue caterpillar smoking a hookah. It asks who they are and blows smoke rings into their faces. Jefferson coughs and mutters that he hates Wonderland. The pair come upon the Queen of Hearts's hedge maze where the Evil Queen wishes to go to the building in the center. Jefferson refuses out of fear of the Queen of Hearts, but the Evil Queen reminds him that he cannot leave without her. He cautions that the hedges eat whatever comes too close, but she burns a straight path to the building with magic. The Evil Queen takes a small box from the building, causing guards to appear. They are able to narrowly escape. She and Jefferson hurry back to the mirror, but the Evil Queen stops to take a piece of the mushroom. She places the piece into the box, and her father Henry (Tony Perez) appears out of the box. Jefferson is horrified. He realizes that the Queen knew about the hat's rule and did not tell him that her father was abducted by the Queen of Hearts for leverage on purpose. Because there are now three people, one of them cannot leave Wonderland. The Evil Queen freezes Jefferson's feet to the path, and he begs her to let him go back to his daughter. She tells him that if he cared for Grace, he would have never left her. The Evil Queen and Henry walk through the mirror and leave Jefferson behind staring at the mirror in a daze as guards drag him away. Jefferson is presented to the Queen of Hearts (Jennifer Koenig). She knows that he helped the Evil Queen and has her aide the Knave of Hearts (Paul McGillion) ask how they got into Wonderland. He says that he will tell her only after he is allowed to go home to his daughter. The Queen of Hearts orders him beheaded, and he is decapitated, though to his horrified surprise he remains alive. He is told that if he wants his head reattached, he must answer the question. He tells the Queen of Hearts about his hat. When asked about the hat's whereabouts, he says that the Evil Queen took it. The Queen of Hearts tells him that if he only requires the magical hat to return home, he only has to make another. However, he replies that he cannot: a hat without magic is just a hat and will not work. The Queen of Hearts tells him that his task is to get a hat to work. Afterwards, he is seen in a large room filled with millions of failed hats, making yet another hat and frantically muttering to himself to get it to work; it is apparent he has gone mad (hence the name) over the separation from his daughter. Production \\"Hat Trick\\" was co-written by Vladimir Cvetko and co-executive producer David H. Goodman, while Silk Stalkings veteran, Ralph Hemecker, served as director for the episode. The Who's Roger Daltrey made an uncredited cameo appearance as the voice of the hookah-smoking caterpillar (that only says \\"Who...Are...You?). This episode was the first of several for actor Sebastian Stan, as his character, Jefferson, recurred in two more episodes during season one. Producers stated that there was a possibility for him to return in season two, but that was before Stan became a series regular on the upcoming limited run USA drama Political Animals. Stan would eventually return in the second season. The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale ‚Äì a novelization of the first season ‚Äì which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013. Cultural references There are multiple references made to Disney's 1951 animated and 2010 live action versions of Lewis Carrolls' Alice in Wonderland, although they slightly differ from both. Among them is the white rabbit, the tea party, the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter's hat. In the beginning of the episode, as the queen leaves Jefferson's cabin in the woods, a notecard next to a bottle and cake allude directly to the tale. In the Storybrooke setting, Mary Margaret hits Jefferson with a croquet mallet that resembles the one featured in the animated film. In addition, Jefferson and Regina enter Wonderland through a mirror, a reference to Through the Looking-Glass, the sequel of Alice in Wonderland and a nod to how Alice gets to Wonderland in that novel. Another allusion involved the name Jefferson, a reference to Jefferson Airplane, who recorded a song that was titled \\"White Rabbit.\\" Also, Jefferson's daughter Grace is a reference to Grace Slick, the lead singer of Jefferson Airplane/Starship. Reception =Ratings= The episode's ratings and viewership was up slightly, but continued to remain steady, scoring an 18-49 rating of 2.9/8 and was watched by 8.82 million viewers, as well as winning its timeslot. In Canada, the episode finished in nineteenth place for the week with an estimated 1.337 million viewers, an increase from the 1.254 million of the previous episode.

Mantid. 35, pl. 12, f. 4. common name Indonesian double shield mantis or double shield mantis are the only species in the genus Pnigomantis of mantis of the family Mantidae. Description Adult males are about 79 millimeters in length while adult females are about 86 to 89 millimeters in length. The coloration is highly variable, and seemingly not related to environmental conditions. There are red bands in between the upper abdominal segments used in the threat display used to deter predators. The characteristic \\"double shield\\" appears roughly after the fifth instar, females have nine instars, while males have eight. The inside of the forearms is a light blue-purple color, with dark black markings on the lower arms to seemingly act as eyespots. Most adults will turn a grey color with slight checkering on the wings, two light spots are present on the forewings. The Pnigomantis also possesses two light \\"cheek\\" patches. Range Pnigomantis medioconstricta are endemic to the island of Flores off of Indonesia. Captivity Pnigomantis medioconstricta are kept in captivity. Breeding this species can be a slight challenge due to females being highly aggressive and the smaller number of males per ootheca. This species of mantid eats many invertebrates and vertebrates. This species is strongly built and very aggressive, and they often chase their prey. First instar nymphs readily take Drosophila hydei fruit flies, and graduate to much larger prey as they near adult. Adult females will occasionally take live mice.

Jamaica became a Crown colony in 1866.  17th century  =English conquest= In late 1654, English leader Oliver Cromwell launched the Western Design armada against Spain's colonies in the Caribbean. In April 1655, General Robert Venables led the armada in an attack on Spain's fort at Santo Domingo, Hispaniola. However, the Spanish repulsed this poorly-executed attack, known as the Siege of Santo Domingo, and the English troops were soon decimated by disease. Weakened by fever and looking for an easy victory following their defeat at Santo Domingo, the English force then sailed for Jamaica, the only Spanish West Indies island that did not have new defensive works. Spanish Jamaica had been a colony of Spain for over a hundred years. In May 1655, around 7,000 English soldiers landed near Jamaica's Spanish Town capital. The English invasion force soon overwhelmed the small number of Spanish troops (at the time, Jamaica's entire population only numbered around 2,500). In the following years, Spain repeatedly attempted to recapture Jamaica, and in response in 1657 the English Governor of Jamaica invited buccaneers to base themselves at Port Royal on Santiago, to help defend against Spanish attacks. Spain never recaptured Jamaica, losing the Battle of Ocho Rios in 1657 and the Battle of Rio Nuevo in 1658. Governor Edward D'Oyley succeeded in persuading one of the leaders of the Spanish Maroons, Juan de Bolas, to switch sides and join the English along with his Maroon warriors. In 1660, when Don Cristobal de Ysasi realised that de Bolas had joined the English, he admitted that the Spanish no longer had a chance of recapturing the island, since de Bolas and his men knew the mountainous interior better than the Spanish and the English. Ysasi gave up on his dreams, and fled to Cuba.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655‚Äì1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 14‚Äì20.C.V. Black, History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 54. For England, Jamaica was to be the 'dagger pointed at the heart of the Spanish Empire,' although in fact it was a possession of little economic value then. =Early English colonisation= Despite the fact that Jamaica was an English colony, Cromwell increased the island's white population by sending indentured servants and prisoners captured in battles with the Irish and Scots, as well as some common criminals.Black, History, p. 51. This practice was continued under Charles II, and the white population was also augmented by immigrants from the North American mainland and other islands, as well as by the English buccaneers. But tropical diseases kept the number of whites well under 10,000 until about 1740. The white population increased, through migration from Britain, to 80,000 in the 1780s.Christer Petley, White Fury (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), p. 24. Although the slave population in the 1670s and 1680s never exceeded roughly 9,500, by the end of the seventeenth century imports of slaves increased the black population to at least three times the number of whites.Orlando Patterson, Sociology of Slavery (Kingston: Sangster's, 1973), p. 95. Beginning with the Stuart monarchy's appointment of a civil governor to Jamaica in 1661, political patterns were established that lasted well into the twentieth century. The second governor, Lord Windsor, brought with him in 1662 a proclamation from the king giving Jamaica's non-slave populace the rights of English citizens, including the right to make their own laws. Although he spent only ten weeks in Jamaica, Lord Windsor laid the foundations of a governing system that was to last for two centuries: a Crown-appointed governor acting with the advice of a nominated council in the legislature. The legislature consisted of the governor and an elected but highly unrepresentative House of Assembly.Black, History of Jamaica, p. 55. England gained formal possession of Jamaica from Spain in 1670 through the Treaty of Madrid.Black, History, p. 69. Removing the pressing need for constant defence against Spanish attack, this change served as an incentive to planting. For years, however, the planter-dominated Jamaica House of Assembly was in continual conflict with the various governors and the Stuart kings; there were also contentious factions within the assembly itself. For much of the 1670s and 1680s, Charles II and James II and the assembly feuded over such matters as the purchase of slaves from ships not run by the royal English trading company.Black, History, pp. 72‚Äì73. The last Stuart governor, the Duke of Albemarle, who was more interested in treasure hunting than in planting, turned the planter oligarchy out of office. After the duke's death in 1688, the planters, who had fled Jamaica to London, succeeded in lobbying James II to order a return to the pre-Albemarle political arrangement and the revolution that brought William III and Mary to the throne in 1689 confirmed the local control of Jamaican planters belonging to the Assembly.Black, History, pp. 72‚Äì73. This settlement also improved the supply of slaves and resulted in more protection, including military support, for the planters against foreign competition. This was of particular importance during the Anglo-French War in the Caribbean from 1689 to 1713. However, even though the Spaniards no longer threatened Jamaica, the early English settlers had to ward off attacks from the French. In 1694, Jean-Baptiste du Casse led a force of three warships and 29 transport ships that landed at Port Morant in eastern Jamaica, where they burnt plantations, destroyed over 50 sugar-works, kidnapped hundreds of slaves, and killed and tortured many white colonists. Du Casse then sailed down the southern coast, eventually landing at Carlisle Bay, with the object of marching on to Spanish Town. However, a militia company of planters and their slaves defeated du Casse, who then destroyed Carlisle Bay, and withdrew to St Domingue.Black, History of Jamaica, pp. 74‚Äì75. =Maroons= When the English captured Jamaica in 1655, the Spanish colonists fled, leaving a large number of African slaves. These former Spanish slaves created three Palenques, or settlements. Former slaves organised under the leadership of Juan de Serras allied with the Spanish guerrillas on the western end of the Cockpit Country, while those under Juan de Bolas established themselves in modern-day Clarendon Parish, Jamaica and served as a \\"black militia\\" for the English. The third chose to join those who had previously escaped from the Spanish to live and intermarry with the Arawak people. Each group of Jamaican Maroons established distinct independent communities in the mountainous interior of Jamaica. They survived by subsistence farming and periodic raids of plantations. Over time, the Maroons came to control large areas of the Jamaican interior. In the second half of the seventeenth century, de Serras fought regular campaigns against the English forces, even attacking the capital of Spanish Town, and he was never defeated by the English. Throughout the seventeenth century, and in the first few decades of the eighteenth century, the Maroons took a heavy toll on the British troops. The British colonial authorities sent local militia and British army units against them, but the Maroons successfully fought a guerrilla campaign against them in the mountainous interior, and forced the British government to seek peace terms to end the expensive conflict.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655‚Äì1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 14‚Äì35. In the early eighteenth century, English- speaking escaped Akan slaves were at the forefront of the Maroon fighting against the British. Cudjoe led the Leeward Maroons in western Jamaica, while Quao and Queen Nanny were the leaders of the Windward Maroons in the Blue Mountains of eastern Jamaica. The rebellion finally ended, however, with the signing of peace agreements in 1739 and 1740.Craton, Michael. Testing the Chains.

Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, pp. 190‚Äì282. =Jamaica's pirate economy= Spanish resistance continued for some years after the English conquest, in some cases with the help of the Jamaican Maroons, but Spain never succeeded in retaking the island. The English established their main coastal town at Port Royal. Under early English rule, Jamaica became a haven of privateers, buccaneers, and occasionally outright pirates: Christopher Myngs, Edward Mansvelt, and most famously, Henry Morgan.Black, History, pp. 55‚Äì71. In addition to being unable to retake their land, Spain was no longer able to provide their colonies in the New World with manufactured goods on a regular basis. The progressive irregularity of annual Spanish fleets, combined with an increasing desperation by colonies for manufactured goods, allowed Port Royal to flourish and by 1659, two hundred houses, shops, and warehouses surrounded the fort. Merchants and privateers worked together in what is now referred to as \\"forced trade.\\" Merchants would sponsor trading endeavors with the Spanish while sponsoring privateers to attack Spanish ships and rob Spanish coastal towns. While the merchants most certainly had the upper hand, the privateers were an integral part of the operation. Nuala Zahedieh, a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, wrote, \\"Both opponents and advocates of so-called ‚Äòforced trade‚Äô declared the town‚Äôs fortune had the dubious distinction of being founded entirely on the servicing of the privateers‚Äô needs and highly lucrative trade in prize commodities.\\"Nuala Zahedieh, \\"Trade, Plunder, and Economic Development in Early English Jamaica, 1655‚Äì89,\\" The Economic History Review 39, no. 2 (1986): 205‚Äì222. She added, \\"A report that the 300 men who accompanied Henry Morgan to Portobello in 1668 returned to the town with a prize to spend of at least ¬£60 each (two or three times the usual annual plantation wage) leaves little doubt that they were right.‚Äù The forced trade became almost a way of life in Port Royal. Michael Pawson and David Busseret wrote \\"...one way or the other nearly all the propertied inhabitants of Port Royal seem to have an interest in privateering.\\"Michael Pawson and David Buisseret, Port Royal, Jamaica (Kingston: University of the West Indies Press, 2000). Forced trade was rapidly making Port Royal one of the wealthiest communities in the English territories of North America, far surpassing any profit made from the production of sugarcane. Zahedieh wrote, \\"The Portobello raid [in 1668] alone produced plunder worth ¬£75,000, more than seven times the annual value of the island‚Äôs sugar exports, which at Port Royal prices did not exceed ¬£10,000 at this time.\\" However, many successful privateers and buccaneers became integrally involved in the growing sugar industry, and its acquisition of large number of African slaves. In the 1670s and 1680s, in his capacity as an owner of a large slave plantation, Morgan led three campaigns against the Jamaican Maroons of Juan de Serras. Morgan achieved some success against the Maroons, who withdrew further into the Blue Mountains, where they were able to stay out of the reach of Morgan and his forces.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655‚Äì1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 23, 32‚Äì33.

Two-thirds of the town sank into the sea immediately after the main shock. According to Robert Renny in his 'An History of Jamaica' (1807): \\"All the wharves sunk at once, and in the space of two minutes, nine-tenths of the city were covered with water, which was raised to such a height, that it entered the uppermost rooms of the few houses which were left standing. The tops of the highest houses, were visible in the water, and surrounded by the masts of vessels, which had been sunk along with them.\\" Before the earthquake, the town consisted of 6,500 inhabitants living in about 2,000 buildings, many constructed of brick and with more than one storey, and all built on loose sand. During the shaking, the sand liquefied and the buildings, along with their occupants, appeared to flow into the sea. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, it was common to ascribe the destruction to divine retribution on the people of Port Royal for their sinful ways. Members of the Jamaica Council declared: \\"We are become by this an instance of God Almighty's severe judgement.\\" This view of the disaster was not confined to Jamaica; in Boston, the Reverend Cotton Mather said in a letter to his uncle: \\"Behold, an accident speaking to all our English America.\\" After the earthquake, the town was partially rebuilt. But the colonial government was relocated to Spanish Town, which had been the capital under Spanish rule. Port Royal was devastated by a fire in 1703 and a hurricane in 1722. Most of the sea trade moved to Kingston. By the late 18th century, Port Royal was largely abandoned.  18th century  =Jamaica's sugar boom= Sugar cane cutters in Jamaica, 1880 Sugar cane cutters in Jamaica, 1891 In the mid-17th century, sugarcane had been brought into the British West Indies by the Dutch,Nancy sharkey, \\"A Barbados Synagogue Is Reborn\\", The New York Times, 11 December 1988Bridgetown synagogueRalph G. Bennett, History of the Jews of the Caribbean from Brazil. Upon landing in Jamaica and other islands, they quickly urged local growers to change their main crops from cotton and tobacco to sugar cane. With depressed prices of cotton and tobacco, due mainly to stiff competition from the North American colonies, the farmers switched, leading to a boom in the Caribbean economies. Sugar was quickly snapped up by the British, who used it in cakes and to sweeten teas. In the eighteenth century, sugar replaced piracy as Jamaica's main source of income and Jamaica became the largest exporter of sugar in the British Empire. The sugar monoculture and slave-worked plantation society spread across Jamaica throughout the eighteenth century.The Plantation Machine by Trevor Burnard, p. 37. The sugar industry was labour-intensive and the English brought hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans to Jamaica. In 1673, there were only 57 sugar estates in Jamaica, but by 1739, the number of sugar plantations grew to 430.Black, History, pp. 97‚Äì110. By 1832, the median- size plantation in Jamaica had about 150 slaves, and nearly one of every four bondsmen lived on units that had at least 250 slaves.Robert William Fogel, \\"Slavery in the New World\\". Without Consent or Contract: The Rise and Fall of American Slavery. pp. 21‚Äì23 In the eighteenth century, the population of black slaves in Jamaica increased significantly from one decade to the next, despite the fact that the slave ships coming from the west coast of Africa preferred to first unload at the islands of the Eastern Caribbean. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the number of slaves in Jamaica did not exceed 45,000, but this population rose to about 75,000 in 1730, and passed the 100,000 mark in the 1740s. In 1778, the black slave population passed 200,000, and by 1800 it had increased to over 300,000.Patterson, Sociology, p. 95. Simon Taylor (sugar planter), who owned estates in the Jamaican parishes of St Thomas and St Mary, was one of the wealthiest men in the British empire in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.https://blog.soton.ac.uk/slaveryandrevolution/simon-taylor-and- jamaican-slavery/ During the eighteenth century, those white men who survived tropical diseases, were, on average, 50 times wealthier than those who resided in the British Isles.Christer Petley, White Fury (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), p. 40. Other British planters who became wealthy as a result of sugar and slavery in Jamaica included Peter Beckford, Francis Price (planter) and Charles Ellis, 1st Baron Seaford. After slavery was abolished in the 1830s, sugar plantations used a variety of forms of labour including workers imported from India under contracts of indenture. =First Maroon War= Starting in the late seventeenth century, there were periodic skirmishes between English militias and the Windward Maroons, alongside occasional slave revolts. In 1673 one such revolt in St. Ann's Parish of 200 slaves created the separate group of Leeward Maroons. These Maroons united with a group of Madagascars who had survived the shipwreck of a slave ship and formed their own maroon community in St. George's parish. Several more rebellions strengthened the numbers of this Leeward group. Notably, in 1690 a revolt at Sutton's plantation, Clarendon of 400 slaves considerably strengthened the Leeward Maroons. In September 1728, the British sent more troops to Jamaica, leading to an intensification of the conflict. However, despite increased numbers, the British colonial authorities were unable to defeat the Windward Maroons.Carey, Bev (1997), The Maroon Story: The Authentic and Original History of the Maroons in the History of Jamaica 1490‚Äì1880. Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, pp. 315‚Äì55 The Leeward Maroons inhabited \\"cockpits,\\" caves, or deep ravines that were easily defended, even against troops with superior firepower. Such guerrilla warfare and the use of scouts who blew the abeng (the cow horn, which was used as a trumpet) to warn of approaching British soldiers allowed the Maroons to evade, thwart, frustrate, and defeat the forces of an Empire. In 1739‚Äì40, the British government in Jamaica recognised that it could not defeat the Maroons, so they offered them treaties of peace instead. In 1739, the British, led by Governor Edward Trelawny, sued for peace with the Leeward Maroon leader, Cudjoe, described by British planters as a short, almost dwarf-like man who for years fought skilfully and bravely to maintain his people's independence. Some writers maintain that during the conflict, Cudjoe became increasingly disillusioned, and quarrelled with his lieutenants and with other Maroon groups. He felt that the only hope for the future was a peace treaty with the enemy which recognized the independence of the Leeward Maroons. In 1742, Cudjoe had to suppress a rebellion of Leeward Maroons against the treaty.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 88‚Äì126. In 1740, the even more rebellious Windward Maroons of the Blue Mountains also agreed to sign a treaty under pressure from both white Jamaicans and the Leeward Maroons.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 88‚Äì126. In exchange for securing their freedom, the Maroons were asked to agree not to harbour new runaway slaves, but rather to help catch them. This last clause in the treaty naturally caused a split between the Maroons and the rest of the black population, although from time to time runaways from the plantations still found their way into new maroon settlements, such as those run by Three Fingered Jack (Jamaica). Another provision of the agreement was that the Maroons would serve to protect the island from invaders. The latter was because the Maroons were revered by the British as skilled warriors.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655‚Äì1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 126‚Äì63 Following the peace treaties of 1739‚Äì1740, virgin land was opened up to settlement, and Jamaica's economy flourished in the period of peace that followed.Michael Siva, After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739‚Äì1842, PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), pp. 77‚Äì79. http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?tabs=moreTab&ct;=display&fn;=search&doc;=BLL01019153409&indx;=1&recIds;=BLL01019153409&recIdxs;=0&elementId;=0&renderMode;=poppedOut&displayMode;=full&frbrVersion;=&frbg;=&&dscnt;=0&scp.scps;=scope%3A%28BLCONTENT%29&vl;(2084770704UI0)=any&tb;=t&vid;=BLVU1&mode;=Basic&srt;=rank&tab;=local_tab&dum;=true&vl;(freeText0)=michael%20sivapragasam&dstmp;=1546605833202Audra Diptee, From Africa to Jamaica: The Making of An Atlantic Slave Society, 1775‚Äì1807 (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2010), p. 10.Vincent Brown, The Reaper‚Äôs Garden: Death and Power in the World of Atlantic Slavery (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2008), p. 15. Five official Maroon towns were established in the aftermath of the treaties - Accompong; Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town); Nanny Town, later known as Moore Town, Scott's Hall (Jamaica), and Charles Town, Jamaica, living under their own rulers and a British supervisor known as a superintendent.Carey, Bev (1997), The Maroon Story: The Authentic and Original History of the Maroons in the History of Jamaica 1490‚Äì1880. Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, pp. 315‚Äì55 =Tacky's Revolt and runaway slave communities= In the 1750s, a runaway slave named Ancoma formed a community made up of escaped slaves in what is now known as Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica. In 1759, Ancoma was eventually killed by a Maroon woman and another woman, both his captives. However, his community continued to thrive, and probably formed the basis of the community of Jack Mansong later that century.Michael Siva, After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739‚Äì1842, PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), pp. 109‚Äì10. The colony's slaves, who outnumbered their white masters by a ratio of 20:1 in 1800, mounted over a dozen major slave conspiracies (the majority of which were organised by Coromantins), and uprisings during the 18th century, including Tacky's revolt in May 1760. In that revolt, Tacky, a slave overseer on the Frontier plantation in Saint Mary Parish, led a group of enslaved Africans in taking over the Frontier and Trinity plantations while killing their enslavers. They then marched to the storeroom at Fort Haldane, where the munitions to defend the town of Port Maria were kept. After killing the storekeeper, Tacky and his men stole nearly 4 barrels of gunpowder and 40 firearms with shot, before marching on to overrun the plantations at Heywood Hall and Esher. By dawn, hundreds of other slaves had joined Tacky and his followers. At Ballard's Valley, the rebels stopped to rejoice in their success. One slave from Esher decided to slip away and sound the alarm. Obeahmen (Caribbean witch doctors) quickly circulated around the camp dispensing a powder that they claimed would protect the men from injury in battle and loudly proclaimed that an Obeahman could not be killed. Confidence was high. Soon there were 70 to 80 mounted militia on their way along with some Maroons from Scott's Hall, who were bound by treaty to suppress such rebellions. When the militia learned of the Obeahman's boast of not being able to be killed, an Obeahman was captured, killed and hung with his mask, ornaments of teeth and bone and feather trimmings at a prominent place visible from the encampment of rebels. Many of the rebels, confidence shaken, returned to their plantations. Tacky and 25 or so men decided to fight on. Tacky and his men went running through the woods being chased by the Maroons and their legendary marksman, Davy the Maroon. While running at full speed, Davy shot Tacky and cut off his head as evidence of his feat, for which he would be richly rewarded. Tacky's head was later displayed on a pole in Spanish Town until a follower took it down in the middle of the night. The rest of Tacky's men were found in a cave near Tacky Falls, having committed suicide rather than going back to slavery. However, despite the defeat of Tacky, his revolt continued to inspire slaves to resist, either by rebellion or by running away. Jack Mansong, also known as Three Fingered Jack (Jamaica), was an escaped slave who formed a community of runaways in eastern Jamaica in the 1770s and 1780s. The runaway community thrived in the same parish of St-Thomas-in-the- East, where they often attacked sugar plantations and enabled other slaves to escape. They also attacked white travellers on the roads.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 113‚Äì14. https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/423482/1/LIBRARY_COPY_After_The_Treaties_Final.pdf In 1781, Jack was killed by a party of Maroons. However, Jack's runaway community continued to thrive under his deputies. In 1792, Dagger was captured by the Jamaican militia, but Toney then took over as leader of the community of runaway slaves in St Thomas, and they were never apprehended or dispersed.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 116‚Äì17. =Second Maroon War= In 1795, the Second Maroon War was instigated when two Maroons from Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town) were flogged by a black slave for allegedly stealing two pigs. When six Maroon leaders came to the British to present their grievances, the British took them as prisoners. This sparked an eight-month conflict, spurred by the fact that the Trelawny Maroons felt that they were being mistreated under the terms of Cudjoe's Treaty of 1739, which ended the First Maroon War.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 209‚Äì49. The war lasted for five months and ended in a stalemate, after the colonial militias suffered a number of losses. The British 5,000 troops and militia outnumbered the Maroons and their runaway slave allies ten to one, but the mountainous and forested topography of Jamaica proved ideal for guerrilla warfare. The Trelawny Maroons surrendered in December 1795 when they felt they were unable to maintain their guerrilla campaign, on the condition that they would not be deported, a promise given to them by Major General George Walpole.Campbell, Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 209‚Äì49. The treaty signed in December between Major General George Walpole and the Maroon leaders established that the Maroons of Trelawny Town would beg on their knees for the King's forgiveness, return all runaway slaves, and be relocated elsewhere in Jamaica. The governor of Jamaica ratified the treaty, but gave the Trelawny Maroons only three days to present themselves to beg forgiveness on 1 January 1796. Suspicious of British intentions, most of the Trelawny Maroons did not surrender until mid-March. The British used the contrived breach of treaty as a pretext to deport the entire Trelawny Town Maroons to Nova Scotia. After a few years the Trelawny Maroons were again transported, this time by their request, to the new British settlement of Sierra Leone in West Africa.Campbell, Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 209‚Äì49.  19th century  =Minorities campaign for rights= In the 18th century, a number of slaves secured their freedom through a variety of means, such as being mistresses or children of plantation whites. In 1780, one of these free people of color, Cubah Cornwallis, became well-known when she nursed British naval hero Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson, back to health in Port Royal when he took ill.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 117. At the turn of the nineteenth century, the Jamaica Assembly granted Jews voting rights that had previously been denied them.http://old.jamaica- gleaner.com/pages/history/story0054.htm After the abolition of the slave trade in 1807/8, the Jamaican Assembly felt they needed the support of minority groups in order to avoid the complete emancipation of the slaves. At first, the Assembly resisted attempts from free coloureds in Jamaica to secure equal rights, and in 1823 the Assembly deported one of their leaders, Louis Celeste Lecesne. However, after they granted the Jews voting rights, they finally succumbed to demands from the free coloureds for equal rights. Campaigners such as Edward Jordon, Robert Osborn (Jamaica) and Richard Hill (Jamaica) were successful in securing equal rights for free people of color at the beginning of the 1830s.Mavis Campbell, The Dynamics of Change in a Slave Society (London: AUP, 1976). =Slave resistance= Hundreds of runaway slaves secured their freedom by escaping and fighting alongside the Maroons of Trelawny Town. About half of these runaways surrendered with the Maroons, and many were executed or re-sold in slavery to Cuba. However, a few hundred stayed out in the forests of the Cockpit Country, and they joined other runaway communities. In 1798, a slave named Cuffee (Jamaica) ran away from a western estate, and established a runaway community which was able to resist attempts by the colonial forces and the Maroons remaining in Jamaica to subdue them.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 165-9, 172-5, 180-9. In the early nineteenth century, colonial records describe hundreds of runaway slaves escaping to \\"Healthshire\\" where they flourished for several years before they were captured by a party of Maroons.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 163-4, 196. In 1812, a community of runaways started when a dozen men and some women escaped from the sugar plantations of Trelawny into the Cockpit Country, and they created a village with the curious name of Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come. By the 1820s, Me-no-Sen-You- no-Come housed between 50-60 runaways. The headmen of the community were escaped slaves named Warren and Forbes. Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come also conducted a thriving trade with slaves from the north coast, who exchanged their salt provisions with the runaways for their ground provisions.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 191-2. In October 1824, the colonial militias tried to destroy this community. However, the community of Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come continued to thrive in the Cockpit Country until Emancipation in the 1830s.Siva, After The Treaties, pp. 192-3. =The Baptist War= In 1831, enslaved Baptist preacher Samuel Sharpe led a strike among demanding more freedom and a working wage of \\"half the going wage rate.\\" Upon refusal of their demands, the strike escalated into a full rebellion. The Baptist War, as it was known, became the largest slave uprising in the British West Indies, lasting 10 days and mobilised as many as 60,000 of Jamaica's 300,000 slave population.Barry W. Higman, \\"Slave Populations of the British Caribbean, 1807‚Äì1834\\", Journal of Interdisciplinary History, Vol. 16, No. 2 (Autumn, 1985), pp. 365‚Äì367 The rebellion was suppressed with relative ease by British forces, under the control of Sir Willoughby Cotton. The reaction of the Jamaican Government and plantocracyCraton, Michael. Testing the Chains: Resistance to Slavery in the British West Indies (Cornell University Press, 1983), pp. 297‚Äì98 was far more brutal. Approximately five hundred slaves were killed in total: 207 during the revolt and somewhere in the range between 310 and 340 slaves were killed through \\"various forms of judicial executions\\" after the rebellion was concluded, at times, for quite minor offences (one recorded execution indicates the crime being the theft of a pig; another, a cow).Mary Reckord. \\"The Jamaican Slave Rebellion of 1831\\", Past & Present (July 1968), 40(3): pp. 122, 124‚Äì125. An 1853 account by Henry Bleby described how three or four simultaneous executions were commonly observed; bodies would be allowed to pile up until workhouse negroes carted the bodies away at night and bury them in mass graves outside town. The brutality of the plantocracy during the revolt is thought to have accelerated the process of emancipation, with initial measures beginning in 1833. =Emancipation= Because of the loss of property and life in the 1831 Baptist War rebellion, the British Parliament held two inquiries. Their reports on conditions contributed greatly to the abolition movement and passage of the 1833 law to abolish slavery as of 1 August 1834, throughout the British Empire.Craton, Testing the Chains, pp. 319-323. The Jamaican slaves were bound (indentured) to their former owners' service, albeit with a guarantee of rights, until 1838 under what was called the Apprenticeship System. This Apprenticeship was originally scheduled to run until 1840, but the numerous abuses committed by white plantation owners on their black apprentices led to the British government terminating it two years ahead of schedule, and the ex-slaves were finally awarded full freedom. The planters often found themselves in conflict with Richard Hill, the mixed-race Head of the Department of the Stipendiary Magistrates, over their mistreatment of the apprentices.Black History of Jamaica, pp. 159-167.Mavis Campbell, The Dynamics of Change in a Slave Society (London: AUP, 1976), p. 156. Early historians believed that with the abolition of the slave trade in 1808 and slavery itself in 1834, the island's sugar- and slave-based economy faltered. However, Eric Williams presented evidence to show that the British only abolished first the slave trade and then slavery itself when they were no longer economically viable institutions.Eric Williams, Capitalism and Slavery (Chapel Hill : University of North Carolina Press, 1945). =Post-Emancipation Jamaica= The period after emancipation in the 1830s initially was marked by a conflict between the plantocracy and elements in the Colonial Office over the extent to which individual freedom should be coupled with political participation for blacks. In 1840 the Assembly changed the voting qualifications in a way that enabled a significant number of blacks and people of mixed race (browns or mulattos) to vote, but placed property ownership restrictions on them, which excluded the majority of non-white men from voting.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), pp. 183-4. The requirements were an income of ¬£180 a year, or real property worth ¬£1,800, or both real and personal property worth ¬£3,000. These figures excluded the vast majority of freed black Jamaicans from the right to vote in Assembly elections. Consequently, neither Emancipation nor the change in voting qualifications resulted in a change in the political system. The chief interests of the planter class lay in the continued profitability of their estates, and they continued to dominate the elitist Assembly.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), pp. 183-4. At the end of the eighteenth century and in the early years of the nineteenth century, the Crown began to allow some Jamaicans ‚Äî mostly local merchants, urban professionals, and artisans ‚Äî into the appointed councils. Two free people of colour, Edward Jordon and Richard Hill, became leading figures in post-emancipation Jamaica. In 1835, Hill was appointed Head of the Department of Stipendiary Magistrates, a position he held for many years.Mavis Campbell, The Dynamics of Change in a Slave Society (London: AUP, 1976), p. 156. In 1835, Jordon was elected a member of the Assembly for Kingston, and he led the Kings House Party, or Coloured Party, that opposed the Planters Party. In 1852, Jordon became mayor Kingston, a post he held for 14 years, and he was speaker for the Assembly in the early 1860s. https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs- transcripts-and-maps/jordon-edward =Morant Bay Rebellion= Tensions resulted in the October 1865 Morant Bay rebellion led by Paul Bogle. The rebellion was sparked on 7 October, when a black man was put on trial and imprisoned for allegedly trespassing on a long-abandoned plantation. During the proceedings, James Geoghegon, a black spectator, disrupted the trial, and in the police's attempts to seize him and remove him from the courthouse, a fight broke out between the police and other spectators. While pursuing Geoghegon, the two policeman were beaten with sticks and stones.Holt (1992), p. 295. The following Monday arrest warrants were issued for several men for rioting, resisting arrest, and assaulting the police. Among them was Baptist preacher Paul Bogle. A few days later on 11 October, Mr. Paul Bogle marched with a group of protesters to Morant Bay. When the group arrived at the court house they were met by a small and inexperienced volunteer militia. The crowd began pelting the militia with rocks and sticks, and the militia opened fire on the group, killing seven black protesters before retreating. Governor John Eyre sent government troops, under Brigadier-General Alexander Nelson,\\"Alexander Nelson\\" at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. to hunt down the poorly armed rebels and bring Paul Bogle back to Morant Bay for trial. The troops met with no organised resistance, but regardless they killed blacks indiscriminately, most of whom had not been involved in the riot or rebellion: according to one soldier, \\"we slaughtered all before us‚Ä¶ man or woman or child\\". In the end, 439 black Jamaicans were killed directly by soldiers, and 354 more (including Paul Bogle) were arrested and later executed, some without proper trials. Paul Bogle was executed \\"either the same evening he was tried or the next morning.\\"\\"The Jamaica Prosecutions. Further Examinations of Colonel Nelson and Lieutenant Brand\\", The Illustrated Police News: Law-Courts and Weekly Record (London), 23 February 1867: 1. Other punishments included flogging for over 600 men and women (including some pregnant women), and long prison sentences, with thousands of homes belonging to black Jamaicans were burned down without any justifiable reason. George William Gordon, a Jamaican businessman and politician, who had been critical of Governor John Eyre and his policies, was later arrested by Governor John Eyre who believed he had been behind the rebellion. Despite having very little to do with it, Gordon was eventually executed. Though he was arrested in Kingston, he was transferred by Eyre to Morant Bay, where he could be tried under martial law. The execution and trial of Gordon via martial law raised some constitutional issues back in Britain, where concerns emerged about whether British dependencies should be ruled under the government of law, or through military license. The speedy trial saw Gordon hanged on 23 October, just two days after his trial had begun. He and William Bogle, Paul's brother, \\"were both tried together, and executed at the same time.\\" =Decline of the sugar industry= During most of the eighteenth century, a monocrop economy based on sugar production for export flourished. In the last quarter of the century, however, the Jamaican sugar economy declined as famines, hurricanes, colonial wars, and wars of independence disrupted trade. Despite the British Parliament's 1807 abolition of the slave trade, under which the transportation of slaves to Jamaica after 1 March 1808 was forbidden, sugar continued to have some success over the next decade. By the 1820s, however, Jamaican sugar had become less competitive with that from high-volume producers such as Cuba and production subsequently declined. By 1882 sugar output was less than half the level achieved in 1828. When sugar declined as a crop, the British government was persuaded to emancipate the slaves with the abolition of slavery in 1834 and full emancipation within four years.Eric Williams, Capitalism and Slavery (Chapel Hill : University of North Carolina Press, 1945). Unable to convert the ex-slaves into a sharecropping tenant class similar to the one established in the post-Civil War South of the United States, planters became increasingly dependent on wage labour and began recruiting workers abroad, primarily from India, China, and Sierra Leone. Many of the former slaves settled in peasant or small farm communities in the interior of the island, the \\"yam belt,\\" where they engaged in subsistence and some cash crop farming. The second half of the nineteenth century was a period of severe economic decline for Jamaica. Low crop prices, droughts, and disease led to serious social unrest, culminating in the Morant Bay rebellions of 1865. Governor Eyre took this opportunity to abolish the Assembly, which was becoming increasingly influenced by free black and mixed-race representatives. Jordon and Osborn strongly opposed the measure, but it was pushed through by Eyre despite their opposition. https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and- maps/jordon-edward Retrieved 2 September 2020. Tuesday, April 2, 1878 edition of The Colonial Standard And Jamaica Despatch. However, renewed British administration after the 1865 rebellion, in the form of Crown colony status, resulted in some social and economic progress as well as investment in the physical infrastructure. Agricultural development was the centrepiece of restored British rule in Jamaica. In 1868 the first large-scale irrigation project was launched. In 1895 the Jamaica Agricultural Society was founded to promote more scientific and profitable methods of farming. Also in the 1890s, the Crown Lands Settlement Scheme was introduced, a land reform programme of sorts, which allowed small farmers to purchase two hectares or more of land on favourable terms. Between 1865 and 1930, the character of landholding in Jamaica changed substantially, as sugar declined in importance. As many former plantations went bankrupt, some land was sold to Jamaican peasants under the Crown Lands Settlement whereas other cane fields were consolidated by dominant British producers, most notably by the British firm Tate and Lyle. Although the concentration of land and wealth in Jamaica was not as drastic as in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, by the 1920s the typical sugar plantation on the island had increased to an average of 266 hectares. But, as noted, smallscale agriculture in Jamaica survived the consolidation of land by sugar powers. The number of small holdings in fact tripled between 1865 and 1930, thus retaining a large portion of the population as peasantry. Most of the expansion in small holdings took place before 1910, with farms averaging between two and twenty hectares. The rise of the banana trade during the second half of the nineteenth century also changed production and trade patterns on the island. Bananas were first exported in 1867, and banana farming grew rapidly thereafter. By 1890, bananas had replaced sugar as Jamaica's principal export. Production rose from 5 million stems (32 percent of exports) in 1897 to an average of 20 million stems a year in the 1920s and 1930s, or over half of domestic exports. As with sugar, the presence of American companies, like the well-known United Fruit Company in Jamaica, was a driving force behind renewed agricultural exports. The British also became more interested in Jamaican bananas than in the country's sugar. Expansion of banana production, however, was hampered by serious labour shortages. The rise of the banana economy took place amidst a general exodus of up to 11,000 Jamaicans a year. =Jamaica as a Crown Colony= In 1846 Jamaican planters, still reeling from the loss of slave labour, suffered a crushing blow when Britain passed the Sugar Duties Act, eliminating Jamaica's traditionally favoured status as its primary supplier of sugar. The Jamaica House of Assembly and successive governors stumbled from one crisis to another until the collapse of the sugar trade, when racial and religious tensions came to a head during the Morant Bay rebellion of 1865.Gad Heuman, The Killing Time: The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994). Although suppressed ruthlessly, the severe rioting so alarmed the white planters that governor Edward John Eyre and the Colonial Office succeeded in persuading the two- centuries-old assembly to vote to abolish itself and ask for the establishment of direct British rule. This move ended the growing influence of the people of colour in elective politics. The practice of barring non-whites from public office was reinstated, despite opposition from leading people of colour such as Jordon.https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs- transcripts-and-maps/jordon-edward In 1866 the new Crown colony government consisted of the Legislative Council and the executive Privy Council containing members of both chambers of the House of Assembly, but the Colonial Office exercised effective power through a presiding British governor. The council included a few handpicked prominent Jamaicans for the sake of appearance only. In the late nineteenth century, Crown colony rule was modified; representation and limited self-rule were reintroduced gradually into Jamaica after 1884. The colony's legal structure was reformed along the lines of English common law and county courts, and a constabulary force was established. The smooth working of the Crown colony system was dependent on a good understanding and an identity of interests between the governing officials, who were British, and most of the nonofficial, nominated members of the Legislative Council, who were Jamaicans. The elected members of this body were in a permanent minority and without any influence or administrative power. The unstated alliance ‚Äì based on shared color, attitudes, and interest ‚Äì between the British officials and the Jamaican upper class was reinforced in London, where the West India Committee lobbied for Jamaican interests. However, the property qualification and a literacy test ensured that only a small percentage of the black Jamaican majority could vote in these elections. Jamaica's white or near-white propertied class continued to hold the dominant position in every respect; the vast majority of the black population remained poor and disenfranchised.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 232. As black Jamaicans becoming discontented with their lack of political representation, they turned to the support of two leaders who challenged the racial hierarchy, both insisting that black people were the equals of the white people who dominated the government and the island's wealth. Alexander Bedward was a Revivalist preacher who espoused the concept of pan-Africanism. Dr Joseph Robert Love founded a newspaper and campaigned for black representation in the political arena. Both men were the forerunners of Marcus Mosiah Garvey. =Kingston, the new capital= In 1872, the government passed an act to transfer government offices from Spanish Town to Kingston. Kingston had been founded as a refuge for survivors of the 1692 earthquake that destroyed Port Royal. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by the Nick Catania Pirate Fleet's fire in 1703. Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. By 1716 it had become the largest town and the center of trade for Jamaica. The government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in Port Royal, and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of Liguanea. In 1755 the governor, Sir Charles Knowles, had decided to transfer the government offices from Spanish Town to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1965), pp. 91-2. However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston. The 1907 Kingston earthquake destroyed much of the city. Considered by many writers of that time one of the world's deadliest earthquakes, it resulted in the death of over eight hundred Jamaicans and destroyed the homes of over ten thousand more.J. F.

Garvey also promoted the Back-to-Africa movement, which called for those of African descent to return to the homelands of their ancestors. Garvey, to no avail, pleaded with the colonial government to improve living conditions for black and indigenous peoples in the West Indies. Garvey, a controversial figure, had been the target of a four-year investigation by the United States government. He was convicted of mail fraud in 1923 and had served most of a five-year term in an Atlanta penitentiary when he was deported to Jamaica in 1927. Garvey left the colony in 1935 to live in the United Kingdom, where he died heavily in debt five years later. He was proclaimed Jamaica's first national hero in the 1960s after Edward P.G. Seaga, then a government minister, arranged the return of his remains to Jamaica. In 1987 Jamaica petitioned the United States Congress to pardon Garvey on the basis that the federal charges brought against him were unsubstantiated and unjust. =Rastafari movement= The Rastafari movement, an Abrahamic religion, was developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, following the coronation of Haile Selassie I as Emperor of Ethiopia. Haile Selassie I was crowned as Emperor of Ethiopia in November 1930, a significant event in that Ethiopia was the only African country other than Liberia to be independent from colonialism and Haile Selassie was the only African leader accepted among the kings and queens of Europe. Over the next two years, three Jamaicans who all happened to be overseas at the time of the coronation each returned home and independently began, as street preachers, to proclaim the divinity of the newly crowned Emperor as the returned Christ.Leonard E. Barrett, The Rastafarians, pp. 81‚Äì82. First, in December 1930, Archibald Dunkley, formerly a seaman, landed at Port Antonio and soon began his ministry; in 1933, he relocated to Kingston where the King of Kings Ethiopian Mission was founded. Joseph Hibbert returned from Costa Rica in 1931 and started spreading his own conviction of the Emperor's divinity in Benoah district, Saint Andrew Parish, through his own ministry, called Ethiopian Coptic Faith; he too moved to Kingston the next year, to find Leonard Howell already teaching many of these same doctrines, having returned to Jamaica around the same time. With the addition of Robert Hinds, himself a Garveyite and former Bedwardite, these four preachers soon began to attract a following among Jamaica's poor. =The Great Depression and worker protests= Elected black Council members, such as barrister J.A.G. Smith, strongly criticised the colonial government in the early 20th century. While acknowledging these criticisms, the British government did little to address them.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 228. The Great Depression caused sugar prices to slump in 1929 and led to the return of many Jamaicans, who had migrated abroad for work. Economic stagnation, discontent with unemployment, low wages, high prices, and poor living conditions caused social unrest in the 1930s.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 228. Uprisings in Jamaica began on the Frome Sugar Estate in the western parish of Westmoreland and quickly spread east to Kingston. Jamaica, in particular, set the pace for the region in its demands for economic development from British colonial rule. The police put down the strike with force, resulting in the deaths of several strikers, while a number of policemen were injured. This led to further disturbances occurring in other parts of the island. In 1938, the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union gathered support, while Norman Manley formed the People's National Party, which initially also including his cousin, union leader Alexander Bustamante.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 229. Because of disturbances in Jamaica and the rest of the region, the British in 1938 appointed the Moyne Commission. An immediate result of the Commission was the Colonial Development Welfare Act, which provided for the expenditure of approximately ≈Å1 million a year for twenty years on coordinated development in the British West Indies. Concrete actions, however, were not implemented to deal with Jamaica's massive structural problems.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 230. =New labour unions and political parties= The rise of nationalism, as distinct from island identification or desire for self-determination, is generally dated to the 1938 labour riots that took place in Jamaica and the islands of the Eastern Caribbean. William Alexander Bustamante, a moneylender in the capital city of Kingston who had formed the Jamaica Trade Workers and Tradesmen Union (JTWTU) three years earlier, captured the imagination of the black masses with his messianic personality. He was light-skinned, affluent, and aristocratic. Bustamante emerged from the 1938 strikes and other disturbances as a populist leader and the principal spokesperson for the militant urban working class. In that year, using the JTWTU as a stepping stone, he founded the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU), which inaugurated Jamaica's workers movement. A cousin of Bustamante, Norman W. Manley, concluded as a result of the 1938 riots that the basis for national unity in Jamaica lay in the masses. Unlike the union- oriented Bustamante, however, Manley was more interested in access to control over state power and political rights for the masses. On 18 September 1938, he inaugurated the People's National Party (PNP). It began as a nationalist movement supported by the mixed-race middle class and the liberal sector of the business community; its leaders were highly educated members of the upper middle class. The 1938 riots spurred the PNP to unionise labour, although it would be several years before the PNP formed major labour unions. The party concentrated its earliest efforts on establishing a network both in urban areas and in banana-growing rural parishes, later working on building support among small farmers and in areas of bauxite mining. In 1940 the PNP adopted a socialist ideology and later it joined the Socialist International, allying formally with the social democratic parties of Western Europe. Guided by socialist principles, Manley was not a doctrinaire socialist. PNP socialism during the 1940s was similar to British Labour Party ideas on state control of the factors of production, equality of opportunity, and a welfare state. The left-wing element in the PNP held more orthodox Marxist views and worked for the internationalisation of the trade union movement through the Caribbean Labour Congress. In those formative years of Jamaican political and union activity, relations between Manley and Bustamante were cordial. Manley defended Bustamante in court against charges brought by the British for his labour activism in the 1938 riots and looked after the BITU during Bustamante's imprisonment. Bustamante had political ambitions of his own, however. In 1942, while still incarcerated, he founded a political party to rival the PNP, called the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). The new party, whose leaders were of a lower class than those of the PNP, was supported by conservative businessmen and 60,000 dues-paying BITU members. They encompassed dock and sugar plantation workers and other unskilled urban labourers. On his release in 1943, Bustamante began building up the JLP. Meanwhile, several PNP leaders organised the leftist-oriented Trade Union Congress (TUC). Thus, from an early stage in modern Jamaica, unionised labour was an integral part of organised political life. For the next quarter century, Bustamante and Manley competed for centre stage in Jamaican political affairs, the former espousing the cause of the \\"barefoot man\\"; the latter, \\"democratic socialism,\\" a loosely defined political and economic theory aimed at achieving a classless system of government. Jamaica's two founding fathers projected quite different popular images. Bustamante, lacking even a high school diploma, was an autocratic, charismatic, and highly adept politician; Manley was an athletic, Oxford- trained lawyer, Rhodes scholar, humanist, and liberal intellectual. Although considerably more reserved than Bustamante, Manley was well liked and widely respected. He was also a visionary nationalist who became the driving force behind the Crown colony's quest for independence. Following the 1938 disturbances in the West Indies, London sent the Moyne Commission to study conditions in the British Caribbean territories. Its findings led in the early 1940s to better wages and a new constitution. In 1954, the PNP expelled Richard Hart (Jamaican politician), a Marxist, and three other PNP members for their (alleged) communist views.Taylor, Orville (20 May 2012), \\"Workers' 'Weak': 50 Years Of Betrayal\\", The Gleaner. The other three members were Frank Hill, Ken Hill and Arthur Henry, and they were collectively referred to as \\"the four Hs\\".\\"John Barnes ‚Äì The footballer traces his grandfather's central role in the campaign for Jamaican independence\\", Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine. Episode aired BBC One, 17 October 2012. Hart and the other members of \\"the four Hs\\" were very active in the trade union movement in Jamaica.\\"13. History of the Jamaica Labour Movement\\", The Voice of Coloured Labour (George Padmore, editor), 1945. In the 1940s and 1950s. Hart worked as a member of the Executive Committee of the Trade Union Council from 1946 to 1948. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Caribbean Labour Congress from 1945 to 1946 and Assistant Secretary from 1947 to 1953. The expulsion of the 'Four Hs' signalled a parting of ways between the PNP and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), which was aligned to the PNP. The National Workers Union (NWU) effectively filled the vacuum left by the TUC.Garfield Higgins, \\"Plastic smiles and constipated glad-handing cannot smother reality, PNP\\", Jamaica Observer, 14 June 2020 http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/the-agenda/plastic- smiles-and-constipated-glad-handing-cannot-smother-reality- pnp_196158?profile=1096 Retrieved 11 September 2020. =Colonial elections= The new Constitution increased voter eligibility considerably. In 1919, women gained the right to vote in Jamaica, but only about one-twelfth of the population had the right to vote. In 1943, out of a population of 1.2 million, about 700,000 now had the right to vote.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 232. Issued on 20 November 1944, the Constitution modified the Crown colony system and inaugurated limited self-government based on the Westminster model of government and universal adult suffrage. It also embodied the island's principles of ministerial responsibility and the rule of law. Thirty-one percent of the population participated in the 1944 elections. Held on 12 December 1944, the turnout was 58.7%. The Jamaica Labour Party ‚Äì helped by its promises to create jobs, its practice of dispensing public funds in pro-JLP parishes, and the PNP's relatively radical platform ‚Äì won an 18 percent majority of the votes over the PNP, as well as 22 seats in the 32-member House of Representatives. The PNP won 5 seats and 5 were gained by other, short-lived parties. Bustamante took office as the unofficial leader of government.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 232. Under the new charter, the British governor, assisted by the six-member Privy Council and ten-member Executive Council, remained responsible solely to the Crown. The Jamaican Legislative Council became the upper house, or Senate, of the bicameral Parliament. House members were elected by adult suffrage from single-member electoral districts called constituencies. Despite these changes, ultimate power remained concentrated in the hands of the governor and other high officials. The 1949 Jamaican general election was much closer. The PNP received more votes (203,048) than the JLP (199,538), but the JLP secured more seats; 17 to the PNP's 13. Two seats were won by independents. The voter turnout was 65.2%. The parties lobbied the colonial government for a further increase in constitutional powers for the elected government, and in June 1953 a new constitution provided for the appointment of a chief minister and seven other Ministers from the elected House of Representatives. They now had a majority over the official and nominated members. For the first time, the Ministers could now exercise wide responsibility in the management of the internal affairs of the island. The only limits placed on their powers pertained to public security, public prosecutions and matters affecting members of the Civil Service, which still fell under the Colonial Secretary. In 1953, Bustamante became Jamaica's first chief minister (the pre- independence title for head of government).C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 233. In the 1955 Jamaican general election, the PNP won for the first time, securing 18 out of 32 seats. The JLP ended up with 14 seats, and there were no independents. The voter turnout with 65.1%. As a result, Norman Manley became the new chief minister.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 233. The 1959 Jamaican general election was held on 28 July 1959, and the number of seats was increased to 45. The PNP secured a wider margin of victory, taking 29 seats to the JLP's 16. Manley was appointed Jamaica's first premier on 14 August 1959.Michael Burke, \\"Norman Manley as premier\\", Jamaica Observer, 13 August 2014 http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Norman-Manley-as-premier_17349996 Retrieved 10 September 2020. = West Indies Federation and road to independence = When the British government decided to merge its Caribbean colonies, the West Indies Federation consisting of Jamaica and nine other colonies was formed in 1958. The West Indies Federal Labour Party was organised by Manley and the Democratic Labour Party by Bustamante. In the 1958 Federal Elections, the DLP won 11 of the 17 seats in Jamaica. Neither Manley nor Bustamante contested the Federal elections. However, nationalism was at a rise and dissatisfaction with the new union was great. Jamaica's share of seats in the Federal parliament was smaller than its share of the total population of the Federation; many Jamaicans expressed the view that the smaller islands would be a drain on Jamaica's wealth; Jamaica was geographically distant from the eastern Caribbean; and many Jamaicans were upset that Kingston was not chosen as the Federal capital. Three years after the Federal elections, the Federation was no closer to secured independence, and Bustamante began campaigning for Jamaica's withdrawal from the Federation, in order for Jamaica to secure its independence in its own right. Manley responded by offering the people a chance to decide whether or not they wanted Jamaica to remain in the Federation. In the 1961 Federation membership referendum Jamaica voted 54% to leave the West Indies Federation. Other members began withdrawing soon after. After losing the referendum, Manley took Jamaica to the polls in April 1962, to secure a mandate for the island's independence. On 10 April 1962, of the 45 seats up for contention in the 1962 Jamaican general election, the JLP won 26 seats and the PNP 19. The voter turnout was 72.9%.Dieter Nohlen (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p. 430. This resulted in the independence of Jamaica on 6 August 1962, and several other British colonies in the West Indies followed suit in the next decade. Bustamante had replaced Manley as premier between April and August, and on independence, he became Jamaica's first prime minister. Economy The first European settlers, the Spanish, were primarily interested in extracting precious metals and did not develop or otherwise transform Jamaica. In 1655 the English occupied the island and began a slow process of creating an agricultural economy based on slave labour in support of England's industrial revolution. During the seventeenth century, the basic patterns and social system of the sugar plantation economy were established in Jamaica. Large estates owned by absentee planters were managed by local agents. The slave population increased rapidly during the last quarter of the seventeenth century and, by the end of the century, slaves outnumbered white Europeans by at least five to one. Because conditions were extremely harsh under the slave regime and the mortality rate for slaves was high, the slave population expanded through the slave trade from West Africa rather than by natural increase. During most of the eighteenth century, a monocrop economy based on sugar production for export flourished. In the last quarter of the century, however, the Jamaican sugar economy declined as famines, hurricanes, colonial wars, and wars of independence disrupted trade. By the 1820s, Jamaican sugar had become less competitive with that from high-volume producers such as Cuba and production subsequently declined.Eric Williams, Capitalism and Slavery (London: Andre Deutsch, 1964). By 1882 sugar output was less than half the level achieved in 1828. Earlier historians believed that a major reason for the decline of sugar was the British Parliament's 1807 abolition of the slave trade, under which the transportation of slaves to Jamaica after 1 March 1808 was forbidden. However, Seymour Drescher presented evidence to show that the Jamaican sugar economy flourished before and after the abolition of the slave trade.Seymour Drescher, Econocide (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010). The abolition of the slave trade was followed by the abolition of slavery in 1834 and full emancipation within four years. Eric Williams presented evidence to show that the sugar economy went into decline in the 1820s, and it was only then that the British anti- slavery movement gathered pace.Eric Williams, Capitalism and Slavery (London: Andre Deutsch, 1964). Unable to convert the ex-slaves into a sharecropping tenant class similar to the one established in the post-Civil War South of the United States, planters became increasingly dependent on wage labour and began recruiting workers abroad, primarily from India, China, and Sierra Leone. Many of the former slaves settled in peasant or small farm communities in the interior of the island, the \\"yam belt,\\" where they engaged in subsistence and some cash crop farming. The second half of the nineteenth century was a period of severe economic decline for Jamaica. Low crop prices, droughts, and disease led to serious social unrest, culminating in the Morant Bay rebellions of 1865. However, renewed British administration after the 1865 rebellion, in the form of Crown colony status, resulted in some social and economic progress as well as investment in the physical infrastructure. Agricultural development was the centrepiece of restored British rule in Jamaica. In 1868 the first large-scale irrigation project was launched. In 1895 the Jamaica Agricultural Society was founded to promote more scientific and profitable methods of farming. Also in the 1890s, the Crown Lands Settlement Scheme was introduced, a land reform program of sorts, which allowed small farmers to purchase two hectares or more of land on favourable terms. Between 1865 and 1930, the character of landholding in Jamaica changed substantially, as sugar declined in importance. As many former plantations went bankrupt, some land was sold to Jamaican peasants under the Crown Lands Settlement whereas other cane fields were consolidated by dominant British producers, most notably by the British firm Tate and Lyle. Although the concentration of land and wealth in Jamaica was not as drastic as in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, by the 1920s the typical sugar plantation on the island had increased to an average of 266 hectares. But, as noted, smallscale agriculture in Jamaica survived the consolidation of land by sugar powers. The number of small holdings in fact tripled between 1865 and 1930, thus retaining a large portion of the population as peasantry. Most of the expansion in small holdings took place before 1910, with farms averaging between two and twenty hectares. The rise of the banana trade during the second half of the nineteenth century also changed production and trade patterns on the island. Bananas were first exported in 1867, and banana farming grew rapidly thereafter. By 1890, bananas had replaced sugar as Jamaica's principal export. Production rose from 5 million stems (32 percent of exports) in 1897 to an average of 20 million stems a year in the 1920s and 1930s, or over half of domestic exports. As with sugar, the presence of American companies, like the well-known United Fruit Company in Jamaica, was a driving force behind renewed agricultural exports. The British also became more interested in Jamaican bananas than in the country's sugar. Expansion of banana production, however, was hampered by serious labour shortages. The rise of the banana economy took place amidst a general exodus of up to 11,000 Jamaicans a year. The Great Depression caused sugar prices to slump in 1929 and led to the return of many Jamaicans. Economic stagnation, discontent with unemployment, low wages, high prices, and poor living conditions caused social unrest in the 1930s. Uprisings in Jamaica began on the Frome Sugar Estate in the western parish of Westmoreland and quickly spread east to Kingston. Jamaica, in particular, set the pace for the region in its demands for economic development from British colonial rule. Because of disturbances in Jamaica and the rest of the region, the British in 1938 appointed the Moyne Commission. An immediate result of the Commission was the Colonial Development Welfare Act, which provided for the expenditure of approximately ≈Å1 million a year for twenty years on coordinated development in the British West Indies. Concrete actions, however, were not implemented to deal with Jamaica's massive structural problems. The expanding relationship that Jamaica entered into with the United States during World War II produced a momentum for change that could not be turned back by the end of the war. Familiarity with the early economic progress achieved in Puerto Rico under Operation Bootstrap, renewed immigration to the United States, the lasting impressions of Marcus Garvey, and the publication of the Moyne Commission Report led to important modifications in the Jamaican political process and demands for economic development. As was the case throughout the Commonwealth Caribbean in the mid- to late 1930s, social upheaval in Jamaica paved the way for the emergence of strong trade unions and nascent political parties. These changes set the stage for early modernisation in the 1940s and 1950s and for limited self-rule, introduced in 1944. An extensive period of postwar growth transformed Jamaica into an increasingly industrial society. This pattern was accelerated with the export of bauxite beginning in the 1950s. The economic structure shifted from a dependence on agriculture that in 1950 accounted for 30.8 percent of GDP to an agricultural contribution of 12.9 percent in 1960 and 6.7 percent in 1970. During the same period, the contribution to GDP of mining increased from less than 1 percent in 1950 to 9.3 percent in 1960 and 12.6 percent in 1970. Manufacturing expanded from 11.3 percent in 1950 to 12.8 in 1960 and 15.7 in 1970.

The terminology that is employed to denote discontinuities varies depending on the theory of syntax at hand. The terms discontinuous constituent, displacement, long distance dependency, unbounded dependency, and projectivity violation are largely synonymous with the term discontinuity. There are various types of discontinuities, the most prominent and widely studied of these being topicalization, wh-fronting, scrambling,Concerning scrambling, see Grewendorf and Stechow (1990). and extraposition. Natural languages vary with respect to the types of discontinuities that they permit. The fixed word order of English allows for relatively few discontinuities compared to, for instance, the Slavic languages, which are much more permissive. Even compared to a closely related language such as German, English is rigid, allowing few discontinuities. Projectivity Projectivity is a principle of tree structures by which discontinuities are identified and defined. A tree structure is said to be projective if there are no crossing dependency edges and/or projection lines.See Gro√ü (1999: 174-187). If there are crossing edges/lines however, then the structure is non-projective and contains one or more projectivity violations. The concept and terminology of projectivity is associated most with the structures of dependency grammar, although the concept is just as applicable to the structures of phrase structure grammars (= constituency grammars). The discussion here considers projectivity first in terms of dependency-based structures and then in terms of constituency-based structures. The flatter the tree structures are, the fewer projectivity violations they will contain. As structures become more layered, the number of projectivity violations can increase. =Dependency-based projectivity= The following trees illustrate projective and non-projective structures in a dependency-based analysis of sentence structure:The dependency grammar understanding of projectivity given here follows Osborne (2019: 203-206) closely. ::Projectivity in DG The trees show all six possible three-level structures conceivable for the three element hierarchy circle-square-triangle. Four of these six trees are projective because they contain no crossing lines. Trees (c) and (e), however, are not projective due to the crossing lines; each of (c) and (e) contains a projectivity violation because a solid dependency edge crosses a dotted projection line. In other words, each of (c) and (e) contains a discontinuity. The trees illustrate when discontinuities occur: if a given constituent (= complete subtree) is separated from its head by an element that dominates its head, a discontinuity obtains. Dependency grammars have explored the projectivity principle in great detail and have formalized it rigorously.See for instance Hays (1964), Gaifman (1965), Robinson (1970), Mel'ƒçuk (1988: 35ff.) The concept is, however, a simple one. If crossing lines obtain in the tree, projectivity has been violated, meaning a discontinuity is present. =Constituency-based projectivity= The terminology that constituency grammars (= phrase structure grammars) employ to identify and define discontinuities is different. The projectivity principle certainly exists, although it is acknowledged in terms of discontinuous constituents,Concerning the term \\"discontinuous constituent, see Wells (1947) and McCawley (1982). long distance dependencies, and/or unbounded dependencies. The constituency-based versions of the six hierarchies from the previous section are rendered as follows. The solid shapes represent phrasal categories, and the empty shapes lexical categories: ::Projectivity in constituency-based syntax The crossing lines again identify projectivity violations. Hence trees (c) and (e) here contain discontinuities, just as they do further above. The solid square constituents in tree (c) and tree (e) are discontinuous in a manner similar to that of the empty square constituents in the dependency-based trees (c) and (e) above. Types Discontinuities occur in most if not all natural languages. But the types of discontinuities that a given language allows may differ from the discontinuities of another language, even if the languages are closely related. Worth noting is that a large majority of sentences in most languages are projective, i.e. they do not contain discontinuities. Only about 15‚Äì25% of actual sentences contain a discontinuity, and the percentage of discontinuous dependencies is even much less, approximately 1‚Äì2%.Concerning these numbers, see Nivre and Nilsson (2005: 99). The following discussion briefly considers four widely acknowledged types of discontinuities: 1) topicalization, 2) wh-fronting, 3) scrambling, and 4) extraposition. English allows three of the four; it does not allow scrambling. Examples from German are therefore used to illustrate scrambling discontinuities. =Topicalization= Topicalization occurs when a constituent is fronted in order to establish it as the topic. The topicalization of argument NPs is rare in English, but adjunct prepositional phrases (PPs) that establish situational context are frequently topicalized. Topicalization is illustrated here (and further below) using both a constituency- and a dependency-based tree, the constituency-based tree on the left and the dependency-based tree on the right. The convention is employed throughout whereby the words themselves are used to label the nodes in the trees: ::Topicalization discontinuities The crossing lines are clearly visible in these trees. Further examples of topicalization discontinuities (but without the trees): ::Due to the weather, we are sure that they left. ::After school, Connor has been practicing piano. ::To his wife, Jim gave a fantastic present. The material in italics has been topicalized, which results in a discontinuity each time. =Wh-fronting= Wh-fronting (= wh-movement) occurs when a wh-expression appears at the front of the clause in order to focus it. Wh-fronting occurs in direct and indirect questions with interrogative words (e.g. how, what, when, where, which, who, why, etc.) and in relative clauses with relative pro-forms (that, what, where, which, when, who, whose, etc.). The constituency-based tree appears again on the left, and the dependency- based tree on the right: ::Wh-fronting discontinuities These trees are (merely) representative of the type of analyses that one encounters in various grammars. Especially the constituency-based tree here may be disputed. Nevertheless, the crossing lines are again clearly visible. Further examples of wh-fronting discontinuities in matrix and embedded clauses: ::Which house does Jim plan to buy? ::Why has that been annoying you? ::Nobody knows what they have been saying. ::the person who we have been seeking ::dangers which you have been ignoring ::a politician whose flip-flops nobody is willing to forget The material in italics has been wh-fronted. The first three examples show wh-fronting in direct or indirect interrogative clauses, and the second three illustrate wh-fronting in relative clauses. =Scrambling= Scrambling can result in a discontinuity (although it need not; sometimes scrambling is accomplished by shifting alone). Scrambling discontinuities often occur in order to accommodate the informational content of constituents, old information preferring to precede new information. Scrambling is frequently visible in the leftward striving of definite pronouns. Scrambling discontinuities are absent from English, but they are very common in languages with freer word order such as German. The following trees illustrate a scrambling discontinuity in a subordinate clause of German: ::Scrambling discontinuities The crossing lines identifying the discontinuity are again completely visible. The reflexive pronoun sich strives leftward, which results in the discontinuity. Discontinuities of this sort occur frequently in German. The italicized expressions in the following examples are separated from their heads in such a manner that scrambling discontinuities obtain: ::Nat√ºrlich kann uns nichts √ºberraschen. (naturally can us nothing surprise; 'Naturally nothing can surprise us.') ::Sie haben den versucht zu lesen. (they have it tried to read; 'They tried to read it.') ::dass ihn viele Leute bewundert haben (that him many people admired have; 'That many people have admired him.') ::Essen werde ich das nicht. (eat shall I that not; 'I shall not eat that.') In each of these examples, the italicized constituent is displaced, resulting in a discontinuity. An important aspect of scrambling is that it can operate in both directions. The displaced unit can both precede its head as in the first three examples and follow it as in the fourth example. =Extraposition= Extraposition occurs when an expression appears further to the right of where it would appear under other (but similar) circumstances. It is motivated by the desire to focus or emphasize the extraposed expression, or it serves to reduce center embedding and in doing so, it increases right- branching, right-branching structures being easier to process in English than left-branching structures: ::Extraposition discontinuities The crossing lines identifying the discontinuity are again easily visible. In canonical cases, extraposition is optional, e.g. ::Something that was unexpected then occurred. ::Something then occurred that was unexpected. ::Did anyone who you expected to help actually help? ::Did anyone actually help who you expected to help? ::They called someone to pick up the kids before school. ::They called someone before school to pick up the kids. One can also distinguish between two types of extraposition. The examples above are canonical cases where extraposition is optional. In cases of it-extraposition, the optionality disappears; extraposition is obligatory: :: *It that it rained surprised us. :: It surprised us that it rained. :: *Did it that they had to study disturb them? :: Did it disturb them that they had to study? The star * indicates that the sentence is nonidiomatic. Apparently when it appears in subject or object position, it forces the modifying expression to be extraposed. Theoretical accounts The challenge posed by discontinuities has fascinated and vexed theories of syntax since the 1950s. Early transformational grammar, which is based on phrase structure, addressed discontinuities in terms of deep structure and surface structure and transformations that mapped constituents out of one position in Deep Structure into another position in Surface Structure. Modern theories of transformational grammar (e.g. Government and Binding TheorySee Chomsky (1981). and the Minimalist ProgramSee Chomsky (1995).) assume a movement or copying procedure that moves or copies constituents out of one position into another in the course of the derivation. Representational phrase structure grammars (e.g. Head-Driven Phrase Structure GrammarSee Pollard and Sag (1994). and Lexical Functional GrammarSee Bresnan (2001).), in contrast, reject movement and in its stead, they assume some sort of feature passing mechanism that passes information about the displaced constituent up and down the tree. Traditional dependency grammars (e.g. Lucien Tesni√®re's Structural SyntaxSee Tesni√®re (1959). and Igor Mel'ƒçuk's Meaning- Text TheorySee Mel'ƒçuk (1988).) approach discontinuities much differently. They tend to (posit one or more levels of syntactic structure that) abstract away from linear order and acknowledge hierarchical order alone. If linear order is taken to be (in a sense) secondary in this manner, discontinuities present less of a challenge and are therefore of secondary importance to the theory. Other dependency grammars, in contrast, take linear and hierarchical order to be of equal importance. These theories are likely to (also) pursue some sort of feature passing mechanism that passes information about the displaced unit up and down the tree. The following trees illustrate the movement/copying type of approach to discontinuities: ::Movement analysis The constituent that idea is seen as being first generated in its canonical position to the right of the verb likes. It is then moved out of that position to the front of the sentence, or it is copied at the front of the sentence followed by the deletion of the lower occurrence. Due to the movement (or copying) this sort of approach to discontinuities can be called the movement approach (= derivational approach). The alternative to the movement approach is information passing up and down the tree, e.g. ::Feature passing analysis The displaced unit is taken to appear first in its surface position (it is not moved to that position), and information (= features) about it is seen as being passed down the tree to the position where it would appear under more normal circumstances. The path of information passing is shown in red. Due to the passing of information, this sort of approach can be called the feature passing approach (= representational approach). The movement and feature passing approaches have something important in common. They both assume that there are no actual discontinuities in surface syntax (for there are no crossing lines in the trees). What appears to be a discontinuity at first blush is actually rather an indication that movement or feature passing has occurred. Finally, one point is worth repeating. All theories must have a means of addressing discontinuities, but the nature of this means can vary significantly based upon the amount of structure that the theory at hand posits. Relatively flat structures incur significantly fewer discontinuities than more layered structures. Thus the component that addresses discontinuities plays a larger role in theories that restrict all branching to binary branching. In theories that allow n-ary branching, the role that inversion and shifting play can be greater, which reduces the role of the component of the theory that is needed to address discontinuities.

The championship was founded in 1937, and dominated by Dynamo Moscow in its early stages. Four years later it was interrupted due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. After the German troops were rejected the competition was resumed in 1944, with MAI becoming a second powerhouse. In 1949 Dynamo Kyiv became the first non-Russian team to win the championship. In 1959 Dynamo Moscow represented the Soviet Union in the inaugural edition of the European Cup. That same the year the championship was won by Latvian team Daugava Riga, which soon established itself as the championship's major powerhouse, winning every edition of the tournament in the 1960s. Daugava's hegemony loosened somewhat in the 1970s, losing the 1974 and 1978 championships to Spartak Leningrad and Spartak Moscow, but still the Latvians, led by Uljana Semjonova, won every other edition until 1984. In the second half of the 1980s Russian teams took again the lead, with CSKA Moscow and Dynamo Novosibirsk entering the competition's palmares. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union the championship was closed after the 1991 edition, which was won by Dynamo Kyiv. A CIS Championship was played in 1992 before each republic founded its own national league.List of champions in Womenbasket.ru The Soviet Championship was one of the best leagues in Europe, with several of the best teams in the continent.

History The town of Despatch is situated on rich clay soil and in the late 1800s was the site of a flourishing brick industry. Despatch's name derives from this brick industry history on the account that bricks were dispatched from the original railway siding. Many of the older buildings in Uitenhage and Port Elizabeth were built from these bricks. Most of these early bricks can be identified by the word 'Despatch' imprinted on the top and bottom of the brick. The only reminder of the town's brick industry past is a chimney built in 1882 which formed part of the Brick Works. The Chimney is situated in a field on the outskirts of the town to the north next to the railway lines. In recent years restoration work has brought it back to its former glory including supports which now give it the appearance of a space rocket. In 1903 the remains of a Stegosaurus were discovered near Despatch. The township of Despatch was originally developed in 1942 to offer cheaper homing alternative for its fast growing neighbours of Uitenhage and Port Elizabeth. The town obtained official municipal status in 1945 and in 2001 it jointed with Uitenhage, Port Elizabeth and surrounding areas to form the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality.

Reality Fighters is a fighting game where the player can take a photo of himself or herself and, using the game's editing tools, become a video game character. The game boasts over 8 trillion unique fighter combinations, which can be used in solo and online play. Reality Fighters is a PlayStation Vita launch title. Gameplay The gameplay of Reality Fighters takes the classic fighting game mechanics and brings them to a wider, more mainstream focus. To begin with, the player takes a photo of the face using the front or rear camera. Using face detection technology, the game can then recreate a character with the player's likeness. The game lets players choose the gender and body shape, and wear over 400 pieces of clothing. The game also allows players to choose among 15 fighting styles, and over 50 weapons. Fighting styles, weapons and clothes choice affect gameplay, by unlocking new combos or modifying the damage or armor of specific body parts. For example, a helmet will better protect the head, and a pair of boots will boost the kicking ability. Reality Fighters offers dual control. On one side, the game can be played via buttons alone, with a classic control method. On the other, the game can be played via the front and rear touch, which allow the player to perform all combos in a more accessible way. There are six different game modes, namely Story Mode, Survivor, Quick Fight, Time Attack, Online versus, and Boss mode. The game also supports social features of the PS Vita like online leaderboards, friend lists, or NEAR. Players can pose and take photos of their characters. Here is a quick summary of the battle UI. Next to the fighter portrait is your healthbar, and under the healthbar is your \\"EX Meter\\". When this meter is completely blue, you can use a certain special move with the triangle button. When it is orange, the same thing happens, but this time, you can use an even stronger move with the circle button.

Born into a California farming family, Coiner attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Art and the Art Institute of Chicago, while also working at an advertising agency. He went to work for the Philadelphia-based N. W. Ayer & Son advertising agency, starting as a layout designer in 1924 and rising to vice president in charge of art in 1936. He was among the first in his field to commission modern artists. For example, for one of his early advertising campaigns (\\"Great Ideas of Western Man\\" for the Container Corporation of America), he incorporated works by such artists as Pablo Picasso, Georgia O'Keeffe and Salvador Dal√≠. He once sent O'Keeffe to Hawaii for a campaign for canned pineapple juice. When \\"she came back with all kinds of beautiful paintings but nothing to do with pineapple\\", she explained that nobody had shown her any pineapple plants, so he sent her one, which she then painted. NRA Blue Eagle When the administrator of the National Recovery Act (NRA) was dissatisfied with designs presented by Ayer, Coiner himself designed the Blue Eagle symbol that is closely associated with the NRA. He also conceived the Red Feather emblem of the Community Chest. During World War II, he designed war and civil defense posters; an offset lithograph of one with the slogan \\"Give It Your Best!\\" (1942) for the Office of Emergency Management is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Another of his works is the Boys Clubs of America commemorative stamp issued in 1960. One of Coiner's passions was painting, primarily landscapes, in a style he himself described as impressionist. The Whitney Museum, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and the Philadelphia Museum of Art exhibited his works. A 1966 self- portrait owned by the National Academy of Design is in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution. After he retired from Ayer in 1964, he became the first American given the Art Director's Award of Distinction, and was inducted into the Art Director's Hall of Fame in 1973 and the Philadelphia Advertising Hall of Fame in 1988. He was a trustee of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and chairman of the Philadelphia College of Art. In 1993, he was posthumously inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame. He was also awarded the 2004 AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts) Medal. Coiner died on August 13, 1989, at the age of 91. He was survived by his wife, E. May Coiner (n√©e Howe).

He later served with distinction on the James River, and in 1871, while serving in the Asiatic Squadron, took part in the Korea Expedition. Biography =Early career= Blake was born in Dutchess County, New York, the son of Elisha Blake (1788‚Äì1837) and Merilla Crane (1791‚Äì1877). When Blake was a year old, his family moved to what was then considered the far West, and settled in Boardman, Ohio. After preparing himself for the naval service, and passing the regular examination, Blake joined the Navy on 2 March 1840, soon after his 18th birthday, with the rank of midshipman. He was sent to the receiving ship at Boston, remaining there until joining the frigate in December 1840, and making a cruise around the world. A few weeks after his return in 1842 he joined the sloop-of-war , serving in her as part of the Africa Squadron, engaged in suppressing the slave-trade. In 1845 he returned to the United States to attend the newly established United States Naval Academy, graduating with the rank of passed midshipman on 12 July 1846. Blake then returned to the Preble and served in her on the coast of California during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. In 1848 Preble was sent to join the East India Squadron. Unfortunately Blake became ill and was left at the Sandwich Islands to recover. After a few weeks he took passage on the ship Matilda to China, rejoining the Preble at Canton. Soon after his arrival he once again fell seriously ill, and was sent home to recuperate. After a short leave of absence, he was ordered to the receiving ship at New York, and from there assigned to the Coast Survey schooner , in which he sailed to the coast of Texas to carry out survey work in Galveston Bay and Harbor. In 1850 Blake joined the frigate , bound for the Pacific, but was soon transferred to the sloop-of-war with the rank of Acting-Master, serving in the East India Squadron. He returned home by way of the Cape of Good Hope, thus completing his third circumnavigation in nine years. In 1852 he was sent to the Naval Observatory, where he was engaged for five months. In 1853 he was assigned to the receiving ship Ohio at Boston, as Acting-Master, and while there was detailed by Commodore Francis Gregory (Commandant of the Boston Navy Yard) to supervise the construction of the frigate . On 14 September 1855, while at Boston, he received promotion to lieutenant. In 1856 he joined the in the Brazil Squadron, returning home in 1859. He was then appointed executive officer of the store-ship , and sent to Luanda on the coast of Africa, to supply the Africa Squadron, returning in 1861. At the request of the Secretary of the Treasury, he was made member of a board to reorganize the Revenue Service. For a short time he commanded the , stationed in Lower New York Bay to intercept shipments of arms to the South. =Civil War= On the outbreak of the Civil War Blake applied for active duty in the Union Navy. In June 1861 he was ordered to join the frigate employed on the coast of South Carolina. His ship was assigned to the Port Royal expedition in November, but was delayed by rescuing the crew of the Governor during a violent storm, and did not arrive in time to take part in the engagement. On 16 July 1862 Blake was promoted to lieutenant-commander and given command of the steamer . However his time in her was short, and he was soon transferred to command of the Hatteras; an iron-hulled ship of 1,000 tons burthen, originally built as a passenger ship. She had been requisitioned by the navy, planked and armed with four 32-pounder guns, two 30-pounder rifles, and one 20-pounder rifle, with a total broadside weight of metal of . Blake joined Hatteras in November 1862, and arrived off Galveston on 6 January 1863. Hatteras v. Alabama The sinking of Hatteras by CSS Alabama, off Galveston, Texas, 11 January 1863. Hatteras, as part of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, patrolled the coast as part of the fleet under the command of Commodore Henry H. Bell. On the afternoon of 11 January 1863, she was ordered to sail to the south-east. After one and a half hours a ship was seen. Blake approached and soon identified her as the Confederate raider CSS Alabama, then under the command Raphael Semmes. Blake knew that the rest of the fleet were too far off to render any assistance and that his own ship was outgunned (Alabama was armed with six 32-pounders, one 110-pounder, and one 68-pounder). Despite this Blake ordered his vessel to clear for action, hoping to capture the Alabama by boarding, or to disable her for long enough for the rest of the fleet to arrive. Night began to fall as the two ships closed. At a distance of Blake hailed the ship, which identified herself as \\"Her Britannic Majesty's ship .\\" However when Blake ordered a boat to be lowered to board her, a voice shouted, \\"We are the Confederate steamer Alabama,\\" followed by a full broadside. The guns of Hatteras replied, and Blake attempted to close with the Alabama, but Semmes used his superior speed to keep his distance and battered the Hatteras to a burning wreck within 20 minutes. When Blake saw that his ship was sinking under him, he signalled his surrender. The Alabama ceased fire and immediately offered assistance. Boats from Alabama rescued the crew, with Blake being the last man to leave. Only minutes later the Hatteras sank. Commodore Bell, having seen and heard the gunfire from twenty miles away, had immediately sent off three vessels to aid the Hatteras, but they were unable to find her in the dark. The next day they found the mastheads of the Hatteras standing upright out of water. Meanwhile the Alabama had sailed for Kingston, Jamaica, with her prisoners, arriving there nine days later. Despite the shortness of the battle Alabama was obliged to remain in port for some days making repairs. Though Blake had lost his ship, he had frustrated Semmes' plan to resupply his ship from captured merchantmen off Galveston, and then sail to the mouth of the Mississippi River. The officers and men of the Hatteras left Jamaica on 4 February aboard the ship Borodino of Boston, stopping at Key West on the 15th, before proceeding to New York. On the James River Blake was given command of the gunboat stationed in the James River, engaged in transporting troops and in occasional engagements with the enemy. The most important of these was on 24 January 1865, when a powerful Confederate squadron launched an attack on the Union blockade of the river at Trent's Reach. Sailing downriver the Confederate force drove away the Union pickets, and commenced removing the boom and obstructions. William A. Parker, the Union naval commander, instead protecting the defences, retired and allowed them to be removed, leaving a clear passage for the enemy. However, two rams went aground, and the Confederates had to wait until high water the following night before proceeding. On the morning of the 25th, Parker was relieved of his command and Blake was made temporary commander of the naval division. Blake ordered the monitor to put herself into a position within the range of enemy batteries, such that, if sunk, she would take the place of the removed obstructions. Subsequent attacks by Union ships and shore batteries sank two and badly damaged six of the Confederate ships, who eventually withdrew. After dark a party from Eutaw, commanded by Acting-Ensign Thomas Morgan boarded the abandoned and re-floated her, finding her not as damaged as believed. In a letter Admiral David Dixon Porter wrote to Blake, \\"Had your predecessor done as well, we should now be in possession of the entire rebel navy, and on our way to Richmond.\\" Blake continued to command the ironclads and naval picket line until the fall of Richmond and end of the war in April 1865. He was then was in charge of the removal of the torpedoes and obstructions from the James River. =Post-war career= A posed photograph of U.S. Navy officers holding a council of war aboard the Asiatic Squadron flagship, the steam frigate , off Korea in June 1871 prior to the Korean Expedition. Commander Homer C. Blake, commanding officer of the sloop-of-war , stands third from left. Blake then served at the Navy's Bureau of Navigation at Portsmouth, New Hampshire receiving promotion to commander on 3 March 1866. He commanded the sloop on the European Squadron in 1868, and on 8 December 1869, commissioned the sloop . The Alaska sailed from New York on 9 April 1870, in company with Rear Admiral John Rodger's flagship, , but soon parted company, and steamed independently to the Far East. Alaska visited many of the more important ports to show the flag. Blake was promoted to captain on 25 May 1871, and soon after joined four other ships of the Asiatic Squadron in an expedition to Korea. In early June, while sailing up the Han River the American ships were fired upon from forts on shore, and Rodgers decided upon a punitive action to capture and destroy them in reprisal. In the subsequent battle of Ganghwa Blake took command of the ground attack forces, successfully capturing three forts. The next day the landing force re-embarked to await the Korean government's response. By 3 July, it became apparent that the Koreans would make no official response to the action and that the desired treaty was not in the offing. Accordingly, Alaska and her consorts got underway to resume their duties on the Asiatic station, finally sailing from Hong Kong on 28 October 1872 bound for New York. On returning home in early 1873, Blake commanded the Naval Rendezvous in New York until 1876. In late 1879, on the retirement of Commodore James Mullany, Blake was nominated for promotion to commodore, and was successfully examined at Washington, D.C. However he became ill, and soon after receiving his commission on 12 January 1880, he died, reportedly of malaria, on the afternoon of 21 January 1880 at his home at 10 East 33rd Street, New York. His funeral was held at the Church of the Atonement on Madison Avenue and 28th Street on 24 January. He left a widow and a daughter, his only son, a law student, having died two years earlier.

The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced labour, and by 212 ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria. Later dynasties adopted different policies towards northern frontier defense. The Han (202 ‚Äì 220), the Northern Qi (550‚Äì574), the Jurchen Jin (1115-1234), and particularly the Ming (1369‚Äì1644) were among those that rebuilt, re-manned, and expanded the Walls, although they rarely followed Qin's routes. The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west, the Qi built about of new walls, while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall-building efforts. Conversely, the Tang (618‚Äì907), the Song (960‚Äì1279), the Yuan (1271‚Äì1368), and the Qing (1644‚Äì1911) mostly did not build frontier walls, instead opting for other solutions to the Inner Asian threat like military campaigning and diplomacy. Although a useful deterrent against raids, at several points throughout its history the Great Wall failed to stop enemies, including in 1644 when the Manchu Qing marched through the gates of Shanhai Pass and replaced the most ardent of the wall-building dynasties, the Ming, as rulers of China. The Great Wall of China visible today largely dates from the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often extending its line through challenging terrain. Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons, deconstructed for their building materials, or lost due to the ravages of time. For long an object of fascination for foreigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination. Geographical considerations thumb The conflict between the Chinese and the nomads, from which the need for the Great Wall arose, stemmed from differences in geography. The 15\\" isohyet marks the extent of settled agriculture, dividing the fertile fields of China to the south and the semi-arid grasslands of Inner Asia to the north. The climates and the topography of the two regions led to distinct modes of societal development. According to the model by sinologist Karl August Wittfogel, the loess soils of Shaanxi made it possible for the Chinese to develop irrigated agriculture early on. Although this allowed them to expand into the lower reaches of the Yellow River valley, such extensive waterworks on an ever- increasing scale required collective labour, something that could only be managed by some form of bureaucracy. Thus the scholar-bureaucrats came to the fore to keep track of the income and expenses of the granaries. Walled cities grew up around the granaries for reasons of defence along with ease of administration; they kept invaders out and ensured that citizens remained within. These cities combined to become feudal states, which eventually united to become an empire. Likewise, according to this model, walls not only enveloped cities as time went by, but also lined the borders of the feudal states and eventually the whole Chinese empire to provide protection against raids from the agrarian northern steppes. The steppe societies of Inner Asia, whose climate favoured a pastoral economy, stood in stark contrast to the Chinese mode of development. As animal herds are migratory by nature, communities could not afford to be stationary and therefore evolved as nomads. According to the influential Mongolist Owen Lattimore this lifestyle proved to be incompatible with the Chinese economic model. As the steppe population grew, pastoral agriculture alone could not support the population, and tribal alliances needed to be maintained by material rewards. For these needs, the nomads had to turn to the settled societies to get grains, metal tools, and luxury goods, which they could not produce by themselves. If denied trade by the settled peoples, the nomads would resort to raiding or even conquest. Potential nomadic incursion from three main areas of Inner Asia caused concern to northern China: Mongolia to the north, Manchuria to the northeast, and Xinjiang to the northwest. Of the three, China's chief concern since the earliest times had been Mongolia - the home of many of the country's fiercest enemies including the Xiongnu, the Xianbei, the Khitans, and the Mongols. The Gobi Desert, which accounts for two-thirds of Mongolia's area, divided the main northern and southern grazing lands and pushed the pastoral nomads to the fringes of the steppe. On the southern side (Inner Mongolia), this pressure brought the nomads into contact with China. For the most part, barring intermittent passes and valleys (the major one being the corridor through Zhangjiakou and the Juyong Pass), the North China Plain remained shielded from the Mongolian steppe by the Yin Mountains. However, if this defence were breached, China's flat terrain offered no protection to the cities on the plain, including the imperial capitals of Beijing, Kaifeng, and Luoyang. Heading west along the Yin Mountains, the range ends where the Yellow River circles northwards upstream in the area known as the Ordos Looptechnically part of the steppe, but capable of irrigated agriculture. Although the Yellow River formed a theoretical natural boundary with the north, such a border so far into the steppe was difficult to maintain. The lands south of the Yellow River‚Äîthe Hetao, the Ordos Desert, and the Loess Plateau‚Äîprovided no natural barriers on the approach to the Wei River valley, the oft-called cradle of Chinese civilization where the ancient capital Xi'an lay. As such, control of the Ordos remained extremely important for the rulers of China: not only for potential influence over the steppe, but also for the security of China proper. The region's strategic importance combined with its untenability led many dynasties to place their first walls here. Although Manchuria is home to the agricultural lands of the Liao River valley, its location beyond the northern mountains relegated it to the relative periphery of Chinese concern. When Chinese state control became weak, at various points in history Manchuria fell under the control of the forest peoples of the area, including the Jurchens and the Manchus. The most crucial route that links Manchuria and the North China Plain is a narrow coastal strip of land, wedged between the Bohai Sea and the Yan Mountains, called the Shanhai Pass (literally the \\"mountain and sea pass\\"). The pass gained much importance during the later dynasties, when the capital was set in Beijing, a mere away. In addition to the Shanhai Pass, a handful of mountain passes also provide access from Manchuria into China through the Yan Mountains, chief among them the Gubeikou and Xifengkou (). Xinjiang, considered part of the Turkestan region, consists of an amalgamation of deserts, oases, and dry steppe barely suitable for agriculture. When influence from the steppe powers of Mongolia waned, the various Central Asian oasis kingdoms and nomadic clans like the G√∂kt√ºrks and Uyghurs were able to form their own states and confederations that threatened China at times. China proper is connected to this area by the Hexi Corridor, a narrow string of oases bounded by the Gobi Desert to the north and the high Tibetan Plateau to the south. In addition to considerations of frontier defence, the Hexi Corridor also formed an important part of the Silk Road trade route. Thus it was also in China's economic interest to control this stretch of land, and hence the Great Wall's western terminus is in this corridor‚Äîthe Yumen Pass during Han times and the Jiayu Pass during the Ming dynasty and thereafter. Pre-imperial China (7th century‚Äì221 BC) Remnants of the Great Wall of Qi on Dafeng Mountain, Changqing District, Jinan, which was once part of the ancient State of Qi during the Warring States Period. One of the first mentions of a wall built against northern invaders is found in a poem, dated from the seventh century BC, recorded in the Classic of Poetry. The poem tells of a king, now identified as King Xuan (r. 827782) of the Western Zhou dynasty (1046771), who commanded General Nan Zhong () to build a wall in the northern regions to fend off the Xianyun. The Xianyun, whose base of power was in the Ordos region, were regarded as part of the charioteering Rong tribes, and their attacks aimed at the early Zhou capital region of Haojing were probably the reason for King Xuan's response. Nan Zhong's campaign was recorded as a great victory. However, only a few years later in 771 BC another branch of the Rong people, the Quanrong, responded to a summons by the renegade Marquess of Shen by over-running the Zhou defences and laying waste to the capital. The cataclysmic event killed King Xuan's successor King You (795-771 ), forced the court to move the capital east to Chengzhou (, later known as Luoyang) a year later, and thus ushered in the Eastern Zhou dynasty (770‚Äì256). Most importantly, the fall of Western Zhou redistributed power to the states that had acknowledged Zhou's nominal rulership. The rule of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was marked by bloody interstate anarchy. With smaller states being annexed and larger states waging constant war upon one another, many rulers came to feel the need to erect walls to protect their borders. Of the earliest textual reference to such a wall was the State of Chu's wall of 656 BC, of which were excavated in southern Henan province in the modern era. However the Chu border fortifications consisted of many individual mountain fortresses; they do not constitute to a lengthy, single wall. The State of Qi also had fortified borders up by the 441BC, and the extant portions in Shandong province had been christened the Great Wall of Qi. The State of Wei built two walls, the western one completed in 361 BC and the eastern in 356 BC, with the extant western wall found in Hancheng, Shaanxi. Even non-Chinese peoples built walls, such as the Di state of Zhongshan and the Yiqu Rong, whose walls were intended to defend against the State of Qin. Of these walls, those of the northern states Yan, Zhao, and Qin were connected by Qin Shi Huang when he united the Chinese states in 221 BC. The walls, known as Changcheng (Èï∑Âüé) ‚Äì literally \\"long walls\\", but often translated as \\"Great Wall\\" ‚Äì were mostly constructed of tamped earth, with some parts built with stones. Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence, the walls were erected sparingly, but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist. Often in addition to the wall, the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall, and watchtowers outside at regular intervals. In terms of defence, the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics, but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature. Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands, and so rather than being defensive, the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions. This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls, suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies. It is entirely possible, as Western scholars like di Cosmo and Lattimore suggest, that nomadic aggression against the Chinese in the coming centuries was partly caused by Chinese expansionism during this period. Map of the Warring States and their frontier walls = Great Wall of Yan = The State of Yan, the easternmost of the three northern states, began to erect walls after the general Qin Kai drove the Donghu people back \\"a thousand li\\" during the reign of Jiping, King Zhao of Yan (312‚Äì279 BC) (; r. 311-279 BC). The Yan wall stretched from the Liaodong peninsula, through Chifeng, and into northern Hebei, possibly bringing its western terminus near the Zhao walls. The ruins in Jianping County, Chaoyang, are its best existing section. Ruins of the Yan Great Wall were also found close to the Ming Great Wall at Badaling, Changping, northeast of Beijing. A southern Yan wall was erected to defend against the Zhao; it was southwest of present-day Beijing and ran parallel to the Juma River for several dozen miles. = Great Wall of Zhao = The Zhao walls to the north were built under King Wuling of Zhao (r. 325-299 BC), whose groundbreaking introduction of nomadic cavalry into his army reshaped Chinese warfare and gave Zhao an initial advantage over his opponents. He attacked the Xiongnu tribes of Linhu () and Loufan () to the north, then waged war on the state of Zhongshan until it was annexed in 296 . In the process, he constructed the northernmost fortified frontier deep in nomadic territory. The Zhao walls were dated in the 1960s to be from King Wuling's reign: a southern long wall in northern Henan encompassing the Yanmen Pass; a second line of barricades encircling the Ordos Loop, extending from Zhangjiakou in the east to the ancient fortress of Gaoque () in the Urad Front Banner; and a third, northernmost line along the southern slopes of the Yin Mountains, extending from Qinghe in the east, passing north of Hohhot, and into Baotou. = Great Wall of Qin = Qin was originally a state on the western fringe of the Chinese political sphere, but it grew into a formidable power in the later parts of the Warring States period when it aggressively expanded in all directions. In the north, the state of Wei and the Yiqu built walls to protect themselves from Qin aggression, but were still unable to stop Qin from eating into their territories. The Qin reformist Shang Yang forced the Wei out of their walled area west of the Yellow River in 340 , and King Huiwen of Qin (r.338‚Äì311) took 25 Yiqu forts in a northern offensive. When King Huiwen died, his widow the Queen Dowager Xuan acted as regent because the succeeding sons were deemed too young to govern. During the reign of King Zhaoxiang (r.306‚Äì251), the queen dowager apparently entered illicit relations with the Yiqu king and gave birth to two of his sons, but later tricked and killed the Yiqu king. Following that coup, the Qin army marched into Yiqu territory at the queen dowager's orders; the Qin annihilated the Yiqu remnants and thus came to possess the Ordos region. At this point the Qin built a wall around their new territories to defend against the true nomads even further north, incorporating the Wei walls. As a result, an estimated total of of Qin walls (including spurts) extended from southern Gansu to the bank of the Yellow River in the Jungar Banner, close to the border with Zhao at the time. Qin dynasty (221‚Äì206 BC) Qin dynasty frontier walls In 221BC, the state of Qin completed its conquest over the other Warring States and united China under Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. These conquests, combined with the Legalist reforms started by Shang Yang in the 4th century BC, transformed China from a loose confederation of feudal states to an authoritarian empire. With the transformation, Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms. Also, once unification was achieved, Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them. Soon after the conquests, in the year 215 BC, the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there, who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier. Qin's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature, since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin's northern borders. Once the Xiongnu were chased away, Meng Tian introduced 30,000 settler families to colonize the newly conquered territories. Wall configurations were changed to reflect the new borders under the Qin. General Meng Tian erected walls beyond the northern loop of the Yellow River, effectively linking the border walls of Qin, Zhao, and Yan. Concurrent to the building of the frontier wall was the destruction of the walls within China that used to divide one warring state from another‚Äîcontrary to the outer walls, which were built to stabilize the newly united China, the inner walls threatened the unity of the empire. In the following year, 214BC, Qin Shi Huang ordered new fortifications to be built along the Yellow River to the west of the Ordos while work continued in the north. This work was completed probably by 212BC, signalled by Qin Shi Huang's imperial tour of inspection and the construction of the Direct Road () connecting the capital Xianyang with the Ordos. The result was a series of long walls running from Gansu to the seacoast in Manchuria. Details of the construction were not found in the official histories, but it could be inferred that the construction conditions were made especially difficult by the long stretches of mountains and semi-desert that the Great Wall traversed, the sparse populations of these areas, and the frigid winter climate. Although the walls were rammed earth, so the bulk of the building material could be found in situ, transportation of additional supplies and labour remained difficult for the reasons named above. The sinologist Derk Bodde posits in The Cambridge History of China that \\"for every man whom Meng Tian could put to work at the scene of actual construction, dozens must have been needed to build approaching roads and to transport supplies.\\" This is supported by the Han dynasty statesman Zhufu Yan's description of Qin Shi Huang's Ordos project in 128BC: > ... the land was brackish and arid, crops could not be grown on them. ... At > the time, the young men being drafted were forced to haul boats and barges > loaded with baggage trains upstream to sustain a steady supply of food and > fodder to the front. ... Commencing at the departure point a man and his > animal could carry thirty zhong (about ) of food supply, by the time they > arrived at the destination, they merely delivered one dan (about ) of > supply. ... When the populace had become tired and weary they started to > dissipate and abscond. The orphans, the frail, the widowed and the seniors > were desperately trying to escape from their appallingly derelict state and > died on the wayside as they wandered away from their home. People started to > revolt. The settlement of the north continued up to Qin Shi Huang's death in 210BC, upon which Meng Tian was ordered to commit suicide in a succession conspiracy. Before killing himself, Meng Tian expressed regret for his walls: \\"Beginning at Lintao and reaching to Liaodong, I built walls and dug moats for more than ten thousand li; was it not inevitable that I broke the earth's veins along the way? This then was my offense.\\" Meng Tian's settlements in the north were abandoned, and the Xiongnu nomads moved back into the Ordos Loop as the Qin empire became consumed by widespread rebellion due to public discontent. Owen Lattimore concluded that the whole project relied upon military power to enforce agriculture on a land more suited for herding, resulting in \\"the anti- historical paradox of attempting two mutually exclusive forms of development simultaneously\\" that was doomed to fail. Han dynasty (206 BC‚Äì220 AD) Western Han dynasty frontier walls and the extent of its territory In 202BC, the former peasant Liu Bang emerged victorious from the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention that followed the rebellion that toppled the Qin dynasty, and proclaimed himself Emperor of the Han dynasty, becoming known as Emperor Gaozu of Han (r.202‚Äì195) to posterity. Unable to address the problem of the resurgent Xiongnu in the Ordos region through military means, Emperor Gaozu was forced to appease the Xiongnu. In exchange for peace, the Han offered tributes along with princesses to marry off to the Xiongnu chiefs. These diplomatic marriages would become known as heqin, and the terms specified that the Great Wall (determined to be either the Warring States period Qin state wall or a short stretch of wall south of Yanmen Pass) was to serve as the line across which neither party would venture. In 162BC, Gaozu's son Emperor Wen clarified the agreement, suggesting the Xiongnu chanyu held authority north of the Wall and the Han emperor held authority south of it. Sima Qian, the author of the Records of the Grand Historian, describes the result of this agreement as one of peace and friendship: \\"from the chanyu downwards, all the Xiongnu grew friendly with the Han, coming and going along the Long Wall\\". However, Chinese records show that the Xiongnu often did not respect the agreement, as the Xiongnu cavalry numbering up to 100,000 made several intrusions into Han territory despite the intermarriage. To Chinese minds, the heqin policy was humiliating and ran contrary to the Sinocentric world order like \\"a person hanging upside down\\", as the statesman Jia Yi (d. 169 BC) puts it. These sentiments manifested themselves in the Han court in the form of the pro-war faction, who advocated the reversal of Han's policy of appeasement. By the reign of Emperor Wu (r.141‚Äì87), the Han felt comfortable enough to go to war with the Xiongnu. After a botched attempt at luring the Xiongnu army into an ambush at the Battle of Mayi in 133 BC, the era of heqin-style appeasement was broken and the Han‚ÄìXiongnu War went into full swing. The ruins of a Han dynasty (202 BC ‚Äì 220 AD) Chinese watchtower made of rammed earth, Gansu province. Part of Emperor Wu's extension of Han's defence lines to the western regions. A video clip showing rammed earth ruins of the Han-period Great Wall at Dunhuang in Gansu province As the Han‚ÄìXiongnu War progressed in favour of the Han, the Wall became maintained and extended beyond Qin lines. In 127BC, General Wei Qing invaded the much-contested Ordos region as far as the Qin fortifications set up by Meng Tian. In this way, Wei Qing reconquered the irrigable lands north of the Ordos and restored the spur of defences protecting that territory from the steppe. In addition to rebuilding the walls, archeologists believe that the Han also erected thousands of kilometres of walls from Hebei to Inner Mongolia during Emperor Wu's reign. The fortifications here include embankments, beacon stations, and forts, all constructed with a combination of tamped-earth cores and stone frontages. From the Ordos Loop, the sporadic and non-continuous Han Great Wall followed the northern edge of the Hexi Corridor through the cities of Wuwei, Zhangye, and Jiuquan, leading into the Juyan Lake Basin, and terminating in two places: the Yumen Pass in the north, or the Yang Pass to the south, both in the vicinity of Dunhuang. Yumen Pass was the most westerly of all Han Chinese fortifications - further west than the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall at Jiayu Pass, about to the east. The garrisons of the watchtowers on the wall were supported by civilian farming and by military agricultural colonies known as tuntian. Behind this line of fortifications, the Han government was able to maintain its settlements and its communications to the Western Regions in central Asia, generally secure from attacks from the north. The campaigns against the Xiongnu and other nomadic peoples of the west exhausted the imperial treasury, and the expansionist policies were reverted in favour of peace under Emperor Wu's successors. The peace was largely respected even when the Han throne was usurped by the minister Wang Mang in 9AD, beginning a brief 15-year interregnum known as the Xin dynasty (923). Despite high tensions between the Xin and the Xiongnu resulting in the deployment of 300,000 men on the Great Wall, no major fighting broke out beyond minor raids. Instead, popular discontent led to banditry and, ultimately, full-scale rebellion. The civil war ended with the Liu clan on the throne again, beginning the Eastern Han dynasty (25220). The restorer Emperor Guangwu (r.25‚Äì57) initiated several projects to consolidate his control within the frontier regions. Defense works were established to the east of the Yanmen Pass, with a line of fortifications and beacon fires stretching from Pingcheng County (present-day Datong) through the valley of the Sanggan River to Dai County, Shanxi. By 38 AD, as a result of raids by the Xiongnu further to the west against the Wei River valley, orders were given for a series of walls to be constructed as defences for the Fen River, the southward course of the Yellow River, and the region of the former imperial capital, Chang'an. These constructions were defensive in nature, which marked a shift from the offensive walls of the preceding Emperor Wu and the rulers of the Warring States. By the early 40sAD the northern frontiers of China had undergone drastic change: the line of the imperial frontier followed not the advanced positions conquered by Emperor Wu but the rear defences indicated roughly by the modern (Ming dynasty) Great Wall. The Ordos region, northern Shanxi, and the upper Luan River basin around Chengde were abandoned and left to the control of the Xiongnu. The rest of the frontier remained somewhat intact until the end of the Han dynasty, with the Dunhuang manuscripts (discovered in 1900) indicating that the military establishment in the northwest was maintained for most of the Eastern Han period. Period of Disunity to the Sui dynasty (220‚Äì618) Following the end of the Han dynasty in 220, China disintegrated into warlord states, which in 280 were briefly reunited under the Western Jin dynasty (265316). There are ambiguous accounts of the Jin rebuilding the Qin wall, but these walls apparently offered no resistance during the Wu Hu uprising, when the nomadic tribes of the steppe evicted the Chinese court from northern China. What followed was a succession of short-lived states in northern China known as the Sixteen Kingdoms, until they were all consolidated by the Xianbei-led Northern Wei dynasty (386535). = Northern Wei Great Wall = As Northern Wei became more economically dependent on agriculture, the Xianbei emperors made a conscious decision to adopt Chinese customs, including passive methods of frontier defence. In 423, a defence line over 2,000 li () long was built to resist the Rouran; its path roughly followed the old Zhao wall from Chicheng County in Hebei Province to Wuyuan County, Inner Mongolia. In 446, 100,000 men were put to work building an inner wall from Yanqing, passing south of the Wei capital Pingcheng, and ending up near Pingguan on the eastern bank of the Yellow River. The two walls formed the basis of the double-layered Xuanfu‚ÄìDatong wall system that protected Beijing a thousand years later during the Ming dynasty. The Northern Wei also built Six Frontier Towns to protect the Hetao meander against northern invasions. = Northern Qi and Northern Zhou = The Northern Wei collapsed in 535 due to civil insurrection to be eventually succeeded by the Northern Qi (550575) and Northern Zhou (557580). Faced with the threat of the G√∂kt√ºrks from the north, from 552 to 556 the Qi built up to 3,000 li (about ) of wall from Shanxi to the sea at Shanhai Pass. Over the course of the year 555 alone, 1.8 million men were mobilized to build the Juyong Pass and extend its wall by through Datong to the eastern banks of the Yellow River. In 557 a secondary wall was built inside the main one. These walls were built quickly from local earth and stones or formed by natural barriers. Two stretches of the stone-and-earth Qi wall still stand in Shanxi today, measuring wide at their bases and high on average. In 577 the Northern Zhou conquered the Northern Qi and in 580 made repairs to the existing Qi walls. The route of the Qi and Zhou walls would be mostly followed by the later Ming wall west of Gubeikou, which includes reconstructed walls from Qi and Zhou. In more recent times, the reddish remnants of the Zhou ramparts in Hebei gave rise to the nickname \\"Red Wall\\". = Sui dynasty = The Sui took power from the Northern Zhou in 581 before reuniting China in 589. Sui's founding emperor, Emperor Wen of Sui (r.581604), carried out considerable wall construction in 581 in Hebei and Shanxi to defend against Ishbara Qaghan of the G√∂kt√ºrks. The new walls proved insufficient in 582 when Ishbara Qaghan avoided them by riding west to raid Gansu and Shaanxi with 400,000 archers. Between 585 and 588 Emperor Wen sought to close this gap by putting walls up in the Ordos Mountains (between Suide and Lingwu) and Inner Mongolia. In 586 as many as 150,000 men are recorded as involved in the construction. Emperor Wen's son Emperor Yang (r.604618) continued to build walls. In 607608 he sent over a million men to build a wall from Yulin to near Huhhot to protect the newly refurbished eastern capital Luoyang. Part of the Sui wall survives to this day in Inner Mongolia as earthen ramparts some high with towers rising to double that. The dynastic history of Sui estimates that 500,000 people died building the wall, adding to the number of casualties caused by Emperor Yang's projects including the aforementioned redesign of Luoyang, the Grand Canal, and two ill-fated campaigns against Goguryeo. With the economy strained and the populace resentful, the Sui dynasty erupted in rebellion and ended with the assassination of Emperor Yang in 618. Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) Frontier policy under the Tang dynasty reversed the wall-building activities of most previous dynasties that had occupied northern China since the third century BC, and no extensive wall building took place for the next several hundred years. Soon after the establishment of the Tang dynasty, during the reign of Emperor Taizong (r.626649), the threat of G√∂kt√ºrk tribesmen from the north prompted some court officials to suggest drafting corv√©e labourers to repair the aging Great Wall. Taizong scoffed at the suggestion, alluding to the Sui walls built in vain: \\"The Emperor Yang of Sui made the people labor to construct the Great Wall in order to defend against the Turks, but in the end this was of no use.\\" Instead of building walls, Taizong claimed he \\"need merely to establish Li Shiji in Jinyang for the dust on the border to settle.\\" Accordingly, Taizong sent talented generals like Li Shiji with mobile armies to the frontier, while fortifications were mostly limited to a series of walled garrisons, such as the euphemistically-named \\"cities for accepting surrender\\" (ÂèóÈôçÂüé, sh√≤uxi√°ng ch√©ng) that were actually bases from which to launch attacks. As a result of this military strategy, the Tang grew to become one of the largest of all the Chinese empires, destroying the G√∂kt√ºrks of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate and acquiring territory stretching all the way to Kazakhstan. Nevertheless, records show that in the Kaiyuan era (713742) of Emperor Xuanzong's reign, the general Zhang Yue built a wall 90 li () to the north of Huairong (Êá∑Êàé; present-day Huailai County, Hebei), although it remains unclear whether he erected new walls or only reinforced the existing Northern Qi walls. The Great Wall, or the ruins of it, features prominently in the subset of Tang poetry known as biansai shi (ÈÇäÂ°ûË©©, \\"frontier verse\\") written by scholar-officials assigned along the frontier. Emphasizing the poets' loneliness and longing for home while hinting at the pointlessness of their posts, these frontier verses are characterized by imagery of desolate landscapes, including the ruins of the now-neglected Great Wall‚Äîa direct product of Tang's frontier policy. Northern Song (960-1127) Han Chinese power during the tumultuous post-Tang era was represented by the Song dynasty (9601279), which completed its unification of the Chinese states with the conquest of Wuyue in 971. Turning to the north after this victory, in 979 the Song eliminated the Northern Han, ultimate successors to the Later Jin, but were unable to take the Sixteen Prefectures from the Liao dynasty. As a result of Song's military aggression, relations between the Song and Liao remained tense and hostile. One of the battlegrounds in the Song‚ÄìLiao War was the Great Wall Gap (Èï∑ÂüéÂè£), so named because the southern Yan wall of the Warring States period crossed the Juma River here into Liao territory. The Great Wall Gap saw action in 979, 988989, and 1004, and a Song fortress was built there in 980. Intermittent wars between the Song and the Liao lasted until January 1005, when a truce was called and led to the Treaty of Chanyuan. This agreement, among other things, required the Song to pay tribute to the Liao, recognized the Song and Liao as equals, and demarcated the Song‚ÄìLiao border, the course of which became more clearly defined in a series of subsequent bilateral agreements. Several stretches of the old Great Walls, including the Northern Qi Inner Wall near the Hengshan mountain range, became the border between the Song and the Liao. In the northwest, the Song were in conflict with the Western Xia, since they occupied what the Song considered as Chinese land lost during the Tang dynasty. The Song utilized the walls built during the reign of Qin's King Zhaoxiang of the Warring States period, making it the Song‚ÄìWestern Xia border, but the topography of the area was not as sharp and distinct as the Song‚ÄìLiao defences to the east. The border general Cao Wei (; 9731030) deemed the Old Wall itself insufficient to slow a Tangut cavalry attack, and had a deep trench dug alongside. This trench, between in width and depth, proved an effective defence, but in 1002 the Tanguts caught the Song patrollers off guard and filled the trench to cross the Old Wall. Later, in 1042, the Tanguts turned the trench against the Song by removing the bridges over it, thereby trapping the retreating army of Ge Huaimin (ËëõÊá∑Êïè) before annihilating it at the Battle of Dingchuan Fortress (ÂÆöÂ∑ùÂØ®). Despite the war with the Western Xia, the Song also settled land disputes with them by referring to prior agreements, as with the Liao. However, soon after the Jin dynasty overthrew the Liao dynasty, the Jurchens sacked the Song capital in 1127 during the Jin‚ÄìSong wars, causing the Song court to flee south of the Yangtze River. For the next two and a half centuries, the Great Wall played no role in Han Chinese geopolitics. Conquest dynasties (907-1368) The Jurchen Jin dynasty (orange) shown with the walls of Liao, Xia, and Jin. After the Tang dynasty ended in 907, the northern frontier area remained out of Han Chinese hands until the establishment of the Ming dynasty in 1368. During this period, non-Han \\"conquest dynasties\\" ruled the north: the Khitan Liao dynasty (9071125) and the succeeding Jurchen Jin dynasty (11151234) in the east and the Tangut Western Xia (10381227) in the west, all of which had built walls against the north. =Liao dynasty frontier= In 907, the Khitan chieftain Abaoji succeeded in getting himself appointed khaghan of all Khitan tribes in the north, laying the foundations to what would officially become the Liao dynasty. In 936, the Khitan supported the Shanxi rebel Shi Jingtang in his revolt against the Shatuo Turkic Later Tang, which had destroyed the usurpers of the Tang in 923. The Khitan leader, Abaoji's second son Yel√º Deguang, convinced Shi to found a new dynasty (the Later Jin, 936946), and received the crucial border region known as the Sixteen Prefectures in return. With the Sixteen Prefectures, the Khitan now possessed all the passes and fortifications that controlled access to the plains of northern China, including the main Great Wall line. Settling in the transitional area between agricultural lands and the steppe, the Khitans became semi-sedentary like their Xianbei predecessors of the Northern Wei, and started to use Chinese methods of defence. In 1026 walls were built through central Manchuria north of Nong'an County to the banks of the Songhua River. =The two walls of Jin dynasty= When the Jurchens, once Liao vassals, rose up to overthrow their masters and established the Jin dynasty, they continued Liao's wall-building activities with extensive work begun before 1138. Further wall construction took place in 1165 and 1181 under the Jin Emperor Shizhong, and later from 1192 to 1203 during the reign of his successor Emperor Zhangzong. This long period of wall-building burdened the populace and provoked controversy. Sometime between 1190 and 1196, during Zhangzong's reign, the high official Zhang Wangong (ÂºµËê¨ÂÖ¨) and the Censorate recommended that work on the wall be indefinitely suspended due to a recent drought, noting: \\"What has been begun is already being flattened by sandstorms, and bullying the people into defence works will simply exhaust them.\\"Collected reports on surveys of the Great Wall of China, 131. However, Chancellor Wanyan Xiang (ÂÆåÈ°èË•Ñ) convinced the emperor of the walls' merits based on an optimistic cost estimate ‚Äì \\"Although the initial outlay for the walls will be one million strings of cash, when the work is done the frontier will be secure with only half the present number of soldiers needed to defend it, which means that every year you will save three million strings of cash ... The benefits will be everlasting\\" ‚Äì and so construction continued unabated.Collected reports on surveys of the Great Wall of China, 130. All this work created an extensive systems of walls, which consisted of a \\"outer wall\\" from Heilongjiang to Mongolia and a network of \\"inner walls\\" north and northeast of Beijing. Together, they formed a roughly elliptical web of fortifications in length and in diameter. Some of these walls had inner moats (from in width), beacon towers, battlements, parapets, and outward- facing semicircular platforms protruding from the wall‚Äîfeatures that set the Jin walls apart from their predecessors. =The Western Xia Great Wall= In the west, the Tanguts took control of the Ordos region, where they established the Western Xia dynasty. Although the Tanguts were not traditionally known for building walls, in 2011 archeologists uncovered of walls at √ñmn√∂govi Province in Mongolia in what had been Western Xia territory. Radiocarbon analysis showed that they were constructed from 1040 to 1160. The walls were as tall as at places when they were discovered, and may have been around taller originally. They were built with mud and saxaul (a desert shrub) in one section, and dark basalt blocks in another, suggesting that the rocks may have been quarried from nearby extinct volcanoes and transported to the construction site. Archaeologists have not yet found traces of human activity around this stretch of wall, which suggests that the Western Xia wall in this location may have been incomplete and not ready for use. =The onset of the Mongols= The Cloud Platform at Juyong Pass In the 13th century, the Mongol leader Genghis Khan, once a vassal of the Jurchens, rose up against the Jin dynasty. In the ensuing Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty, the nomadic invaders avoided direct attacks on the Jin fortifications. Instead, when they could, the Mongols simply rode around the walls; an effective example of this tactic is in 1211, when they circumvented the substantial fortress in Zhangjiakou and inflicted a terrible defeat upon the Jin armies at the Battle of Yehuling. The Mongols also took advantage of lingering Liao resentment against the Jin; the Khitan defenders of the garrisons along the Jin walls, such as those in Gubeikou, often preferred to surrender to the Mongols rather than fight them. The only major engagement of note along the main Great Wall line was at the heavily defended Juyong Pass: instead of laying siege, the Mongol general Jebe lured the defenders out into an ambush and charged in through the opened gates. In 1215, Genghis Khan besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Yanjing (modern-day Beijing). The Jin dynasty eventually collapsed following the siege of Caizhou in 1234. Western Xia had already fallen in 1227, and the Southern Song resisted the Mongols until 1279. With that, the Yuan dynasty, established by Genghis Khan's grandson Khublai Khan, became the first foreign dynasty to rule all of China. Despite being the head of the Mongol Empire, Khublai Khan's rule over China was not free from the threat of the steppe nomads. The Yuan dynasty faced challenges from rival claimants to the title of Great Khan and from rebellious Mongols in the north. Khublai Khan dealt with such threats by using both military blockades and economic sanctions. Although he established garrisons along the steppe frontier from the Juyan Lake Basin in the far west to Yingchang in the east, Khublai Khan and the Yuan emperors after him did not add to the Great Wall (except for the ornate Cloud Platform at Juyong Pass). When the Venetian traveller Marco Polo wrote of his experiences in China during the reign of Khublai Khan, he did not mention a Great Wall. Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) =The early walls= The extent of the Ming dynasty and its walls, which formed most of what is called the Great Wall of China today In 1368, the Hongwu Emperor ( r.136898) ousted the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty from China to inaugurate the Ming dynasty. The Mongols fled back to Mongolia, but even after numerous campaigns, the Mongol problem remained. During his early reign, Hongwu set up the \\"eight outer garrisons\\" close to the steppe and an inner line of forts more suitable for defence. The inner line was the forerunner to the Ming Great Wall. In 1373, as Ming forces encountered setbacks, Hongwu put more emphasis on defence and adopted Hua Yunlong's (ËèØÈõ≤Èæç) suggestion to establish garrisons at 130 passes and other strategic points in the Beijing area. More positions were set up in the years up Hongwu's death in 1398, and watchtowers were manned from the Bohai Sea to Beijing and further onto the Mongolian steppes. These positions, however, were not for a linear defence but rather a regional one in which walls did not feature heavily, and offensive tactics remained the overarching policy at the time. In 1421, the Ming capital was relocated from Nanjing in the south to Beijing in the north, partly to better manage the Mongol situation. Thus defenses were concentrated around Beijing, where stone and earth began to replace rammed earth in strategic passes. A wall was erected by the Ming in Liaodong to protect Han settlers from a possible threat from the Jurched-Mongol Oriyanghan around 1442. In 146768, expansion of the wall provided further protection for the region from against attacks by the Jianzhou Jurchens in the northeast. Meanwhile, the outer defenses were gradually moved inward, thereby sacrificing a vital foothold in the steppe transitional zone. Despite the withdrawal from the steppe, the Ming military remained in a strong position against the nomads until the Tumu Crisis in 1449, which caused the collapse of the early Ming security system. Over half of the campaigning Chinese army perished in the conflict, while the Mongols captured the Zhengtong Emperor. This military debacle shattered the Chinese military might that had so impressed and given pause to the Mongols since the beginning of the dynasty, and caused the Ming to be on the defensive ever after. The deterioration of the Ming military position in the steppe transitional zone gave rise to nomadic raids into Ming territory, including the crucial Ordos region, on a level unprecedented since the dynasty's founding. After decades of deliberation between an offensive strategy and an accommodative policy, the decision to build the first major Ming walls in the Ordos was agreed upon as an acceptable compromise the 1470s. A section of the Great Wall at Jinshanling in Luanping County, Hebei province, China Yu Zijun (‰ΩôÂ≠ê‰øä; 14291489) first proposed constructing a wall in the Ordos region in August 1471, but not until 20December 1472 did the court and emperor approve the plan. The 1473 victory in the Battle of Red Salt Lake (Á¥ÖÈπΩÊ±†) by Wang Yue (ÁéãË∂ä) deterred Mongol invasions long enough for Yu Zijun to complete his wall project in 1474. This wall, a combined effort between Yu Zijun and Wang Yue, stretched from present day Hengcheng (Ê©´Âüé) in Lingwu (northwestern Ningxia province) to Huamachi town (Ëä±È¶¨Ê±†ÈéÆ) in Yanchi County, and from there to Qingshuiying (Ê∏ÖÊ∞¥Ááü) in northeastern Shaanxi, a total of more than 2000 li (about ) long. Along its length were 800 strong points, sentry posts, beacon- fire towers, and assorted defences. 40,000 men were enlisted for this effort, which was completed in several months at a cost of over one million silver taels. This defence system proved its initial worth in 1482, when a large group of Mongol raiders were trapped within the double lines of fortifications and suffered a defeat by the Ming generals. This was seen as a vindication of Yu Zijun's strategy of wall-building by the people of the border areas. By the mid-16th century, Yu's wall in the Ordos had seen expansion into an extensive defence system. It contained two defence lines: Yu's wall, called the \\"great border\\" (Â§ßÈÇä, d√†biƒÅn), and a \\"secondary border\\" (‰∫åÈÇä, √®rbiƒÅn) built by Yang Yiqing (14541530) behind it. Following the success of the Ordos walls, Yu Zijun proposed construction of a further wall that would extend from the Yellow River bend in the Ordos to the Sihaiye Pass (ÂõõÊµ∑ÂÜ∂Âè£; in present-day Yanqing County) near the capital Beijing, running a distance of more than 1300 li (about ). The project received approval in 1485, but Yu's political enemies harped on the cost overruns and forced Yu to scrap the project and retire the same year. For more than 50 years after Yu's resignation, political struggle prevented major wall constructions on a scale comparable to Yu's Ordos project. However, wall construction continued regardless of court politics during this time. The Ordos walls underwent extension, elaboration, and repair well into the 16th century. Brick and stone started to replace tamped earth as the wall building material, because they offered better protection and durability. This change in material gave rise to a number of necessary accommodations with regard to logistics, and inevitably a drastic increase in costs. Instead of being able to draw on local resources, building projects now required brick-kilns, quarries, and transportation routes to deliver bricks to the work site. Also, masons had to be hired since the local peasantry proved inadequate for the level of sophistication that brick constructions required. Work that originally could be done by one man in a month with earth now required 100 men to do in stone. =The Walls of Xuanfu‚ÄìDatong and the western reaches= The Great Wall at Dajingmen, part of the Xuanfu stretch of the Great Wall. The gate structure is a Qing dynasty construction. With the Ordos now adequately fortified, the Mongols avoided its walls by riding east to invade Datong and Xuanfu (ÂÆ£Â∫ú; present-day Xuanhua, Hebei Province), which were two major garrisons guarding the corridor to Beijing where no walls had been built. The two defence lines of Xuanfu and Datong (abbreviated as \\"Xuan‚ÄìDa\\") left by the Northern Qi and the early Ming had deteriorated by this point, and for all intents and purposes the inner line was the capital's main line of defence. From 1544 to 1549, Weng Wanda (ÁøÅËê¨ÈÅî; 14981552) embarked on a defensive building program on a scale unprecedented in Chinese history. Troops were re- deployed along the outer line, new walls and beacon towers were constructed, and fortifications were restored and extended along both lines. Firearms and artillery were mounted on the walls and towers during this time, for both defence and signalling purposes. The project's completion was announced in the sixth month of 1548. At its height, the Xuan‚ÄìDa portion of the Great Wall totalled about of wall, with some sections being doubled-up with two lines of wall, some tripled or even quadrupled. The outer frontier was now protected by a wall called the \\"outer border\\" (Â§ñÈÇä, w√†ibiƒÅn) that extended from the Yellow River's edge at the Piantou Pass (ÂÅèÈ†≠Èóú) along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into Hebei province; the \\"inner border\\" wall (ÂÖßÈÇä, n√®ibiƒÅn) ran southeast from Piantou Pass for some , ending at the Pingxing Pass; a \\"river wall\\" (Ê≤≥ÈÇä, h√©biƒÅn) also ran from the Piantou Pass and followed the Yellow River southwards for about . A section of the Great Wall on the Hanging Cliffs () leading up to Jiayu Pass As with Yu Zijun's wall in the Ordos, the Mongols shifted their attacks away from the newly strengthened Xuan‚ÄìDa sector to less well-protected areas. In the west, Shaanxi province became the target of nomads riding west from the Yellow River loop. The westernmost fortress of Ming China, the Jiayu Pass, saw substantial enhancement with walls starting in 1539, and from there border walls were built discontinuously down the Hexi Corridor to Wuwei, where the low earthen wall split into two. The northern section passed through Zhongwei and Yinchuan, where it met the western edge of the Yellow River loop before connecting with the Ordos walls, while the southern section passed through Lanzhou and continued northeast to Dingbian. The origins and the exact route of this so-called \\"Tibetan loop\\" are still not clear. =From Beijing to Shanhai Pass= In 1550, having once more been refused a request for trade, the T√ºmed Mongols under Altan Khan invaded the Xuan‚ÄìDa region. However, despite several attempts, he could not take Xuanfu due to Weng Wanda's double fortified line while the garrison at Datong bribed him to not attack there. Instead of continuing to operate in the area, he circled around Weng Wanda's wall to the relatively lightly defended Gubeikou, northeast of Beijing. From there Altan Khan passed through the defences and raided the suburbs of Beijing. According to one contemporary source, the raid took more than 60,000 lives and an additional 40,000 people became prisoners. As a response to this raid, the focus of the Ming's northern defences shifted from the Xuan‚ÄìDa region to the Jizhou (ËñäÂ∑ûÈéÆ) and Changping Defence Commands (ÊòåÂπ≥ÈéÆ) where the breach took place. Later in the same year, the dry-stone walls of the Jizhou‚ÄìChangping area (abbreviated as \\"Ji‚ÄìChang\\") were replaced by stone and mortar. These allowed the Chinese to build on steeper, more easily defended slopes and facilitated construction of features such as ramparts, crenelations, and peepholes. The effectiveness of the new walls was demonstrated in the failed Mongol raid of 1554, where raiders expecting a repeat of the events of 1550 were surprised by the higher wall and stiff Chinese resistance. In 1567 Qi Jiguang and Tan Lun, successful generals who fended off the coastal pirates, were reassigned to manage the Ji‚ÄìChang Defense Commands and step up the defences of the capital region. Under their ambitious and energetic management, 1200 brick watchtowers were built along the Great Wall from 1569 to 1571. These included the first large-scale use of hollow watchtowers on the Wall: up until this point, most previous towers along the Great Wall had been solid, with a small hut on top for a sentry to take shelter from the elements and Mongol arrows; the Ji‚ÄìChang towers built from 1569 onwards were hollow brick structures, allowing soldiers interior space to live, store food and water, stockpile weapons, and take shelter from Mongol arrows. Illustration of the Shanhai Pass garrison at the time of the Manchu conquests Altan Khan eventually made peace with China when it opened border cities for trade in 1571, alleviating the Mongol need to raid. This, coupled with Qi and Tan's efforts to secure the frontier, brought a period of relative peace along the border. However, minor raids still happened from time to time when the profits of plunder outweighed those of trade, prompting the Ming to close all gaps along the frontier around Beijing. Areas of difficult terrain once considered impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known vistas of a stone-faced Great Wall snaking over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today. Wall construction continued until the demise of the Ming dynasty in 1644. In the decades that led to the fall of the Ming dynasty, the Ming court and the Great Wall itself had to deal with simultaneous internal rebellions and the Manchu invasions. In addition to their conquest of Liaodong, the Manchus had raided across the Great Wall for the first time in 1629, and again in 1634, 1638, and 1642. Meanwhile, the rebels led by warlord Li Zicheng had been gathering strength. In the early months of 1644, Li Zicheng declared himself the founder of the Shun and marched towards the Ming capital from Shaanxi. His route roughly followed the line of the Great Wall, in order to neutralize its heavily fortified garrisons. The crucial defences of Datong, Xuanfu, and Juyong Pass all surrendered without a fight, and the Chongzhen Emperor hanged himself on 25 April as the Shun army entered Beijing. At this point, the largest remaining Ming fighting force in North China was in Shanhai Pass, where the Great Wall meets the Bohai Sea. Its defender Wu Sangui, wedged between the Shun army within and the Manchus without, decided to surrender to the Manchus and opened the gates for them. The Manchus, having thus entered through the Great Wall, defeated Li Zicheng at the Battle of Shanhai Pass and seized Beijing on June5. They eventually defeated both the rebel-founded Shun dynasty and the remaining Ming resistance, establishing their rule over all of China as the Qing dynasty. Opinions about the Wall's role in the Ming dynasty's downfall are mixed. Historians such as Arthur Waldron and Julia Lovell are critical of the whole wall-building exercise in light of its ultimate failure in protecting China; the former compared the Great Wall with the failed Maginot Line of the French in World War II. However, independent scholar David Spindler notes that the Wall, being only part of a complex foreign policy, received \\"disproportionate blame\\" because it was the most obvious relic of that policy. Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1911) The usefulness of the Great Wall as a defence line against northern nomads became questionable under the Qing dynasty, since their territory encompassed vast areas inside and outside the wall: China proper, Manchuria, and Mongolia were all under Qing control. So instead, the Great Wall became the means to limit Han Chinese movement into the steppes. In the case of Manchuria, considered to be the sacred homeland by the ruling Manchu elites, some parts of the Ming Liaodong Wall were repaired so it could serve to control Han Chinese movement into Manchuria alongside the newly erected Willow Palisade. Culturally, the wall's symbolic role as a line between civilized society and barbarism was suppressed by the Qing, who were keen to weaken the Han culturalism that had been propagated by the Ming. As a result, no special attention was paid to the Great Wall until the mid-Qing dynasty, when Westerners started to show interest in the structure. =Western appreciation of the Wall= \\"A gate of the Wall of China, explaining its structure\\". An illustration from Athanasius Kircher's China Illustrata, 1667. The existence of a colossal wall in Asia had circulated in the Middle East and the West even before the first Europeans arrived in China by sea. The late antiquity historian Ammianus Marcellinus (330?395?) mentioned \\"summits of lofty walls\\" enclosing the land of Seres, the country that the Romans believed to be at the eastern end of the Silk Road. In legend, the tribes of Gog and Magog were said to have been locked out by Alexander the Great with walls of steel. Later Arab writers and travellers, such as Rashid-al-Din Hamadani (12481318) and Ibn Battuta (13041377), would erroneously identify the Great Wall in China with the walls of the Alexander romances. Soon after Europeans reached Ming China in the early 16th century, accounts of the Great Wall started to circulate in Europe, even though no European would see it with their own eyes for another century. The work A Treatise of China and the Adjoyning Regions by Gaspar da Cruz (c. 152070) offered an early discussion of the Great Wall in which he noted, \\"a Wall of an hundred leagues in length. And some will affirme to bee more than a hundred leagues.\\" Another early account written by Bishop Juan Gonz√°lez de Mendoza (15501620) reported a wall five hundred leagues long, but suggested that only one hundred leagues were man-made, with the rest natural rock formations. The Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci (15521610) mentioned the Great Wall once in his diary, noting the existence of \\"a tremendous wall four hundred and five miles long\\" that formed part of the northern defences of the Ming Empire. Europeans first witnessed the Great Wall in the early 1600s. Perhaps the first recorded instance of a European actually entering China via the Great Wall came in 1605, when the Portuguese Jesuit brother Bento de G√≥is reached the northwestern Jiayu Pass from India. Ivan Petlin's 1619 deposition for his Russian embassy mission offers an early account based on a first-hand encounter with the Great Wall, and mentions that in the course of the journey his embassy travelled alongside the Great Wall for ten days. The Great Wall as depicted in Thomas Allom's 1845 China, in a series of views Early European accounts were mostly modest and empirical, closely mirroring contemporary Chinese understanding of the Wall. However, when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape recognizable today, foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole. In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665, the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier. Furthermore, Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC, thereby exaggerating both the Wall's antiquity and its size. This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher (160280), which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator. All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century, in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently. The French philosopher Voltaire (16941774), for example, frequently wrote about the Great Wall, although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a \\"monument to fear\\". The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde, who was there for the annual imperial hunt. One of the embassy's members, John Barrow, later founder of the Royal Geographical Society, spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to \\"all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland\\" and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice. The illustrations of the Great Wall by Lieutenant Henry William Parish during this mission would be reproduced in influential works such as Thomas Allom's 1845 China, in a series of views. Exposure to such works brought many foreign visitors to the Great Wall after China opened its borders as a result of the nation's defeat in the Opium Wars of the mid-19th century at the hands of Britain and the other Western powers. The Juyong Pass near Beijing and the \\"Old Dragon Head,\\" where the Great Wall meets the sea at the Shanhai Pass, proved popular destinations for these wall watchers. The travelogues of the later 19th century in turn further contributed to the elaboration and propagation of the Great Wall myth. Examples of this myth's growth are the false but widespread belief that the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon or Mars. Modern China (1911‚Äìpresent) The Great Wall in 1907 The Xinhai Revolution in 1911 forced the abdication of the last Qing Emperor Puyi and ended China's last imperial dynasty. The revolutionaries, headed by Sun Yat-sen, were concerned with creating a modern sense of national identity in the chaotic post-imperial era. In contrast to Chinese academics such as Liang Qichao, who tried to counter the West's fantastic version of the Great Wall, Sun Yat-sen held the view that Qin Shi Huang's wall preserved the Chinese race, and without it Chinese culture would not have developed enough to expand to the south and assimilate foreign conquerors. Such an endorsement from the \\"Father of Modern China\\" started to transform the Great Wall into a national symbol in the Chinese consciousness, though this transformation was hampered by conflicting views of nationalism with regard to the nascent \\"new China.\\" The failure of the new Republic of China fanned disillusionment with traditional Chinese culture and ushered in the New Culture Movement and the May Fourth Movement of the mid-1910s and 1920s that aimed to dislodge China's future trajectory from its past. Naturally, the Great Wall of China came under attack as a symbol of the past. For example, an influential writer of this period, Lu Xun, harshly criticized the \\"mighty and accursed Great Wall\\" in a short essay: \\"In reality, it has never served any purpose than to make countless workers labour to death in vain ... [It] surrounds everyone.\\" The Sino-Japanese conflict (193145) gave the Great Wall a new lease of life in the eyes of the Chinese. During the 1933 defence of the Great Wall, inadequately- equipped Chinese soldiers held off double their number of Japanese troops for several months. Using the cover of the Great Wall, the Chinese ‚Äì who were at times only armed with broadswords ‚Äì were able to beat off a Japanese advance that had the support of aerial bombardment. With the Chinese forces eventually overrun, the subsequent Tanggu Truce stipulated that the Great Wall was to become a demilitarized zone separating China and the newly created Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. Even so, the determined defence of the Great Wall made it a symbol of Chinese patriotism and the resoluteness of the Chinese people. The Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong picked up this symbol in his poetry during his \\"Long March\\" escaping from Kuomintang prosecution. Near the end of the trek in 1935, Mao wrote the poem \\"Mount Liupan\\" that contains the well-known line that would be carved in stone along the Great Wall in the present day: \\"Those who fail to reach the Great Wall are not true men\\" (). Another noteworthy reference to the Great Wall is in the song \\"The March of the Volunteers\\", whose words came from a stanza in Tian Han's 1934 poem entitled \\"The Great Wall\\". The song, originally from the anti-Japanese movie Children of Troubled Times, enjoyed continued popularity in China and was selected as the provisional national anthem of the People's Republic of China (PRC) at its establishment in 1949.Despite falling from grace during the Cultural Revolution, the anthem's status was confirmed in 1982 and enshrined in the Chinese Constitution in 2004. US President Nixon visits the Great Wall, 1972 In 1952, the scholar-turned-bureaucrat Guo Moruo laid out the first modern proposal to repair the Great Wall. Five years later, the renovated Badaling became the first section to be opened to the public since the establishment of the PRC. The Badaling Great Wall has since become a staple stop for foreign dignitaries who come to China, beginning with Nepali prime minister Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala in 1960, and most notably the American president Richard Nixon in his historic 1972 visit to China. To date, Badaling is still the most visited stretch of the Great Wall. Other stretches did not fare so well. During the Cultural Revolution (196676), hundreds of kilometres of the Great Wall‚Äîalready damaged in the wars of the last century and eroded by wind and rain‚Äîwere deliberately destroyed by fervent Red Guards who regarded it as part of the \\"Four Olds\\" to be eradicated in the new China. Quarrying machines and even dynamite were used to dismantle the Wall, and the pilfered materials were used for construction. As China opened up in the 1980s, reformist leader Deng Xiaoping initiated the \\"Love our China and restore our Great Wall\\" campaign () to repair and preserve the Great Wall. The Great Wall was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. However, while tourism boomed over the years, slipshod restoration methods have left sections of the Great Wall near Beijing \\"looking like a Hollywood set\\" in the words of the National Geographic News. The less prominent stretches of the Great Wall did not get as much attention. In 2002 the New York-based World Monuments Fund put the Great Wall on its list of the World's 100 Most Endangered Sites. In 2003 the Chinese government began to enact laws to protect the Great Wall. Historiography In China, one of the first individuals to attempt a multi-dynastic history of the Great Wall was the 17th-century scholar Gu Yanwu. More recently, in the 1930s and 1940s, Wang Guoliang () and Shou Pengfei () produced exhaustive studies that culled extant literary records to date and mapped the courses of early border walls. However, these efforts were based solely on written records that contain obscure place names and elusive literary references. The rise of modern archeology has contributed much to the study of the Great Wall, either in corroborating existing research or in refuting it. However these efforts do not yet give a full picture of the Great Wall's history, as many wall sites dating to the Period of Disunity (220589) had been overlaid by the extant Ming Great Wall. The first map of China printed in a European atlas, engraved by Abraham Ortelius (1584), shows a series of walls wedged between mountains against the Tartars, represented by yurts. Western scholarship of the Great Wall was, until recently, affected by misconceptions derived from traditional accounts of the Wall. When the Jesuits brought back the first reports of the Wall to the West, European scholars were puzzled that Marco Polo had not mentioned the presumably perennial \\"Great Wall\\" in his Travels. Some 17th- century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty, after Marco Polo's departure. This view was soon replaced by another that argued, against Polo's own account, that the Venetian merchant had come to China from the south and so did not come into contact with the Wall. Thus, Father Martino Martini's mistaken claim that the Wall had \\"lasted right up to the present time without injury or destruction\\" since the time of Qin was accepted as fact by the 18th-century philosophes. Since then, many scholars have operated under the belief that the Great Wall continually defended China's border against the steppe nomads for two thousand years. For example, the 18th-century sinologist Joseph de Guignes assigned macrohistorical importance to such walls when he advanced the theory that the Qin construction forced the Xiongnu to migrate west to Europe and, becoming known as the Huns, ultimately contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire. Some have attempted to make general statements regarding Chinese society and foreign policy based on the conception of a perennial Great Wall: Karl Marx took the Wall to represent the stagnation of the Chinese society and economy, Owen Lattimore supposed that the Great Wall demonstrated a need to divide the nomadic way of life from the agricultural communities of China, and John K. Fairbank posited that the Wall played a part in upholding the Sinocentric world order. Despite the significance that the Great Wall seemed to have, scholarly treatment of the Wall itself remained scant during the 20th century. Joseph Needham bemoaned this dearth when he was compiling the section on walls for his Science and Civilisation in China: \\"There is no lack of travelers' description of the Great Wall, but studies based on modern scholarship are few and far between, whether in Chinese or Western languages.\\" In 1990, Arthur Waldron published the influential The Great Wall: From History to Myth, where he challenged the notion of a unitary Great Wall maintained since antiquity, dismissing it as a modern myth. Waldron's approach prompted a re-examination of the Wall in Western scholarship. Still, as of 2008, there is not yet a full authoritative text in any language that is devoted to the Great Wall. The reason for this, according to The New Yorker journalist Peter Hessler, is that the Great Wall fits into neither the study of political institutions (favoured by Chinese historians) nor the excavation of tombs (favoured by Chinese archeologists). Some of the void left by academia is being filled by independent research from Great Wall enthusiasts such as ex-Xinhua reporter Cheng Dalin (ÊàêÂ§ßÊûó) and self-funded scholar David Spindler.

It was retitled Victory Kickoff!! during its European release, and has been translated into French21 January 2014 VIZ Media Europe Announces a 100% Football Year With Victory Kickoff!! and Italian.Victory Kickoff!! Sfide per la vittoria Characters ; : :Shou is a sixth grader, and in the beginning, he is the last remaining member of the Momoyama Predators and because of that the Manager disbands the team. Shou loves soccer, even though he is pretty bad at it. Despite all that, he goes off to try to find members to revive the team. First he meets Erika and her dog practicing soccer in the park and immediately asks her to join. After \\"recruiting\\" Erika, they have a falling-out when she realizes that there is no team for her to really join. The two come across Misaki Shimizu in the park where they were playing and challenge her to a 2 v 1 match. The two are crushed but in the end Shou manages to steal the ball and score. Shou is very strong-willed and loud, and though his soccer skills aren't so good in the beginning he gets better over time. His greatest asset is his ability to never take his eye off the ball and to see the patterns in the way players move. Misaki says that he will grow to become an amazing soccer player some day. Shou typically plays left defender. ; : :She is a sixth-grader originally from Osaka and is the former ace of the Namba Dandelions. Back then, she was known as the Speed Star due to her speed with the ball. It appears as though her team was also disbanded and she transferred to Shou's school. She has a bit of a complex about boys, saying that they are better than her because she is a girl and in several instances is deeply hurt and angered by it. After meeting Misaki Shimizu and Shou, she learns that women can be great players as well and that there is room for her to get \\"level up\\" if she doesn't give up. Erika is cheerful, full of energy, and very frank. She has a crush on Aoto. She typically plays left forward. ; : :Kota is the first brother of the \\"Triplet Demons\\", and possesses great reflexes and athleticism which allow him to be naturally good at any sport, such as tennis, which is what the three brothers were practicing at the beginning of the anime. His heart longs to play soccer and though he doesn't speak much, when it comes to soccer he gets fired up and annoyed easily. He and his brothers want to be the best and he feels that in order for that to happen that they need an amazing coach. It is hinted that he is the one that initiated the breakaway from Momoyama Predators because the original coach was terrible. Kota has a vicious kick and typically plays center forward. His favorite color is yellow. ; : :Ryuuji is the second brother of the \\"Triplet Demons\\", and possesses great reflexes and athleticism which allow him to be naturally good at any sport, such as tennis which is what the three brothers were practicing at the beginning of the anime. His heart longs to play soccer and when he gets the chance to he gets all fired up. Ryuuji, with his two brothers, left the Momoyama Predators due to the original coach being terrible and as a result many of the other players left leaving only Shou. Ryuuji is mild mannered in comparison to Kota and Ouzou and seems to be the most intelligent out of the three of them. Ryuuji has incredible ball control and typically plays center mid-field. His favorite color is green. ; : :Ouzou is the third brother of the \\"Triplet Demons\\", and possesses great reflexes and athleticism which allow him to be naturally good at any sport, such as tennis which is what the three brothers were practicing at the beginning of the anime. His heart longs to play soccer and when he gets the chance to he gets all fired up. Ouzou, with his two brothers, left the Momoyama Predators due to the original coach being terrible and as a result many of the other players left leaving only Shou. Ouzou is the most boisterous of the brothers and comes off more like a delinquent. Ouzou excels in defense and typically plays right defender. His favorite color is red. ; : :Reika is a large girl that is friends with Erika and is in the same class as Erika and Shou. She has a kind and quiet personality. Despite being large, she has an affinity for soccer. When the team needs one more player to qualify for the preliminaries, Reika steps up. Originally she states that she wants to play soccer for dieting, which really angered the Furuyas (especially Kota). She finds that she loves soccer and pushes hard to prove herself to the team. It is shown that she is in a well-to-do family and that she is secretly skipping her piano lessons to practice soccer under her mother's nose. She is a hard worker and is seen early in the morning practicing hard so that she won't be a burden for the team. ; : :A member of the Heavens FC, he has a rivalry with Kota of the Triplet Demons because he managed to score three goals against them which has Kota up in arms about it. Aoto is actually quite small for his age but has amazing ball control and shooting ability. He is half-japanese and half- Spanish due to his last names. However, he joins the Momoyama Predators in hopes of going to Spain in order to meet his father. ; : : A close friend of Aoto's and new goalie of the Momoyama Predators. He is half-Arabic and half- japanese. He used to play soccer with Aoto, but quit when he got discouraged from his increasing number of goalie errors. However, he begins to miss playing soccer. Aoto and Tagi both join at the same time and can once again watch over each other on the field. ; : :Uchimura, Uematsu, and Ukishima are all friends whose last names start with U, thus they are typically called 3U. They were originally part of the Momoyama Predators but left when the Triplet Demons did on the pretense of having to study for their middle school entrance exams. Uematsu plays with his hair tied back and played as a right forward in the matches against New Tokyo FC women's club teams. ; : :Uchimura, Uematsu, and Ukishima are all friends whose last names start with U, thus they are typically called 3U. They were originally part of the Momoyama Predators but left when the Triplet Demons did on the pretense of having to study for their middle school entrance exams. Ukishima has pretty good reflexes and can pretty much play any position. In the beginning he plays as a goalkeeper in the team's matches against New Tokyo FC women's club teams. ; : :Uchimura, Uematsu, and Ukishima are all friends whose last names start with U, thus they are typically called 3U. They were originally part of the Momoyama Predators but left when the Triplet Demons did on the pretense of having to study for their middle school entrance exams. Uchimura is of a smaller build and has a bit of a bowl haircut. He played as a midfielder alongside Ryuuji Furuya in the matches against New Tokyo FC women's club teams. ; : :Introduced as a random drunkard on a park bench, Masaru was actually a professional soccer player that went by the name Lightning Light ace of the Chiba Thunderbolts. He possesses a lightning fast right kick. After watching him drunkenly dribble and head the ball, Shou gets Masaru(after numerous requests) to teach him how to head the ball. Shortly after he tries to get him to coach their soccer team. He initially refuses due to his past as a coach, but after a few games with the children and their(mainly Shou's) constant nagging he finally accepts. Masaru is easily provoked, as seen multiple times where the Furuya brothers get under his skin eventually forcing him to show off his professional soccer skills. He hates being called \\"Old man\\" because he believes that he isn't really that old. ; : :He originally disbanded the Momoyama Predators due to lack of players(Shou being the only one left in the beginning) but after being approached by Shou who had managed to get the players and a coach(who was a player in the J League and who coached a previous team to the Best 8 of the National Tournament) together he reconsidered. He has a standing rivalry with the manager of Tsubakimori SC and as a requirement of Masaru being a coach and the Momoyama Predators being active again, they MUST defeat Tsubakimori SC and qualify for the district tournament. ; : :A member of the Amarillo FC, an elementary affiliate of the New Tokyo FC. He is known as the Emperor and is quite large and built for a sixth grader. Little is known about him other than he wants to play against the Furuyas very badly. He also has an amazing memory as he remembered Shou was in the Momoyama Predators having only seen him in the huddle once a year ago. ; : :Captain of the Tsubakimori SC, a team managed by the business rival of the manager of the Momoyama Predators. He is first seen trying to force two other players to join him in a 3v3 against the Furuya brothers. When they run away, he gets Shou and Erika to play with them. He has a commanding presence on the field but his skills pale in comparison to the Furuya brothers. ; : :A member of Rosa of New Tokyo FC, she plays the forward position and is known for her speed. She meets Shou and Erika in a park while she is training after an injury and is challenged to a 2v1 by them. After completely dominating them, Shou in the end manages to steal the ball from her and score. Shou asks her to be their coach but being a professional player she had to decline, but wanting to help their cause however she can, she gave them her cell number. She later invites Shou and Erika to a practice with her team and sub teams, which they get to participate in. After showing great promise, Misaki tells the two that they are welcome back after they form a team. She also gives Erika advice on how to deal with playing against boys and saying that it's ok for her to do so at the elementary level. Shou comes back with a team including the Furuya triplets to challenge the women's league, shooting to ultimately play against Misaki's Rosas. They get their wish after crushing the sub teams and are subsequently squashed by them, though their skill still impressed Misaki and the others. She wishes the team well and appears to support them from the background. Misaki was also a founding member of the Namba Dandelions, having drawn up the poorly drawn characters on Erika's poster when she was young. ; : :A fifth grade goalkeeper of decent skill that is picked by Masaru to play with Momoyama Predators in order to qualify for games. ; : :A fifth grade midfielder of decent skill that is picked by Masaru to play with Momoyama Predators in order to qualify for games.

Typically, these were organizations by and for women, whose goal was to raise monuments in Confederate soldiers honor. Their immediate goal, of providing decent burial for soldiers, was joined with the desire to commemorate the sacrifices of Southerners and to propagate the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. Between 1865 and 1900, these associations were a formidable force in Southern culture, establishing cemeteries and raising large monuments often in very conspicuous places, and helped unite white Southerners in an ideology at once therapeutic and political. History Confederate Memorial Monument in Montgomery, Alabama =Origins= The first Ladies' Memorial Association (LMA) sprang up immediately after the end of the Civil War in Winchester, Virginia, which had suffered significantly during the war. Mary Dunbar Williams of Winchester organized a group of women to give proper burial to Confederate dead whose bodies were found in the countryside, and to decorate those graves annually.Janney, Burying the Dead But Not the Past, p. 39. In the summer of 1865, the Winchester women appealed in newspapers for financial aid and soon money began pouring in for the Winchester cemetery. Alabamians, following an appeal by a Montgomery newspaper, were significant contributors, and Stonewall Cemetery, Winchester, (named for Stonewall Jackson) was opened in 1866.Janney, Burying the Dead But Not the Past, pp. 43‚Äì44. Within a year, according to Caroline Janney, seventy such organizations had been founded throughout the South. Another early cemetery was established by the LMA of Wake County, North Carolina.Bishir, Monuments to the Lost Cause, p. 3. The history of the Montgomery LMA indicates that these organizations were part of a broader movement: it built on the work of individuals and \\"Ladies Aid Organizations\\" done during the war, and was given extra impetus by the formation (by gentlemen of the city) of a historical society (toward the end of 1865) and the news from other states (Mississippi) and cities (Selma) of the formation of women's associations in early 1866. After an emotional plea in the paper, \\"the women of Montgomery, in answer to this call, filled the sacred halls of the old Court Street Methodist Church on that beautiful Monday morning on the sixteenth day of April, eighteen-hundred and sixty-six!\\"Cory, The Ladies' Memorial Association of Montgomery, Alabama, pp. 25‚Äì47; quote on p. 47. In Kentucky, the Cynthiana Confederate Monument Association raised the funds for designing and installing the Confederate Monument in Cynthiana in 1869. It was the first Confederate monument of over sixty American Civil War monuments in Kentucky. In Montgomery, the LMA raised $10,000 for the Confederate Memorial Monument on the grounds of the Alabama State Capitol, designed by Alexander Doyle and erected in 1898. Monuments built by LMAs (on cemeteries) often included sculptures symbolizing Johnny Reb, such as in Petersburg, Virginia: \\"the statue of the soldier is of bronze, a Confederate soldier, six foot high, 'accountred as a private of infantry, a full cartridge box, lightly filled haversack, rolled blanket, canteen and old slouch hat' that in the days gone by waved the measure of the yell of 'Johnny Reb.'--the fiercest war-cry that ever smote a foeman's ear.\\"Confederated Southern Memorial Association, History of the Confederate Memorial Associations, p. 290. In Athens, Georgia, Laura Rutherford had headed a soldier's aid society. After the end of the Civil War, she converted that into a chapter of the LMA. When she died in 1888, her daughter, Mildred Lewis Rutherford became president for life of the chapter.Case, Georgia Women, p. 282. In early 1866, the Soldiers' Aid Society of Columbus, Ga. reorganized themselves into the Ladies Memorial Association of Columbus. They elected Evelyn Carter as president; Margaret Ware, first Vice President; Mrs J. A. McAllister, second Vice President; Martha Patten, Treasurer and Mary Ann Williams as corresponding secretary. Mrs. Williams wrote a letter urging Southern women to come together on April 26, 1866 to decorate the graves of Confederate soldiers with flowers. The letter was printed in newspapers across the south. In The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America, Bellware and Gardiner showed just how widely the letter was published. The ladies responded and the Memorial Day holiday in the United States was inaugurated. It takes its name from the Ladies Memorial Associations that organized the observances. Two years later, on May 5, 1868, John A. Logan, Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), commanded all posts across the country to decorate Union graves with flowers on May 30. Thereafter, the April holiday became known as Confederate Memorial Day. The May 30 holiday was commonly known as both Decoration Day and Memorial Day. The GAR officially adopted the name Memorial Day at their 1882 encampment. =Growth= Because they were women's organizations, and since women were generally considered to be non-political beings, Southerners soon saw the benefit of these organizations, which were able to propagate the Lost Cause of the Confederacy without being treasonous to the US government. Women in the LMAs, according to Janney, \\"expand[ed] on two trends that had developed during the war: the creation of an organized womanhood among southern white women and a sense of white southern solidarity among ex-Confederates.\\"Janney, Burying the Dead But Not the Past, p. 40. LMAs, along with other women's organizations, also aided in the care for and repatriation of Confederate veterans.Janney, Burying the Dead But Not the Past, p. 43. The movement for which they provided the first impetus is referred to as the \\"Confederate Memorial movement\\".Whites, The Civil War as a Crisis in Gender, p. 165. The popularity of these organizations was helped by what was perceived as a lack of respect on the US government's part for Southern dead. Starting in 1866, scouts were sent out from the North to retrieve Union soldiers' bodies for burial in United States National Cemetery, from which Confederate soldiers were excluded.Janney, Burying the Dead But Not the Past, pp. 45‚Äì46. Other cities soon followed Winchester's example and many chapters are still active, such as in Montgomery (founded 1866) and Fredericksburg, Virginia (1870). In May 1900, the different memorial associations of all the Southern states had their first national meeting, in Louisville, Kentucky, where officers for a national organization were chosen. Their historian, Margaret Cary Green Davis, outlined the goals of the association thusly: > To future generations of the people of the South and to the sons and > daughters of the women of the Confederacy, who first banded themselves > together in memorial work, may this Confederation carry its messages and > legacy of devotion to the memory of a Cause and the heroes who fought for > it, the Deathless Dead of the Southern Confederacy.Confederated Southern > Memorial Association, History of the Confederate Memorial Associations, p. > 31. Cultural importance While LMAs provided an opportunity for Southern white women to express their dedication to the Lost Cause and at the same time allowed those women to organize in ways did not threaten the male establishment, they also helped resurrect Southern masculinity, according to LeeAnn Whites: the men who had been forced to give up the traditional Southern male prerogatives of \\"slaveownership and regional dominance\\" could now \\"reconstruct\\" and \\"valorize themselves by honoring the greater sacrifice of the Confederate Dead.\\"Whites, The Civil War as a Crisis in Gender, p. 167. Thus, their function was therapeutic in respect to the psychological trauma suffered as a result of the Confederacy's loss; at the same time, while \\"ostensibly apolitical\\", they acted on public policy by \\"advancing and refining the Confederate tradition and reinforcing the political and social hierarchy they believed in. ... these women accomplished what their overtly political men could not. Remaining above the political fray yet skillfully navigating difficult political situations, they repeatedly gained state support in establishing their version of history as the official public memory.\\"Bishir, Monuments to the Lost Cause, p. 23. The promotion of public commemoration and the establishment of a Confederate memory by organizations such as the LMAs took place in a world in which the now-public presence of African Americans caused great anxiety, suggesting, according to some scholars, a \\"more purposeful strategy of racism\\".Brown, Reconstructions, pp. 224‚Äì225. While much credit is usually given to the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) for \\"transform[ing] military defeat into a political and cultural victory, where states' rights and white supremacy remained intact\\", authors such as Janney have argued that LMAs did so long before the UDC was founded in 1894.Janney, \\"The Right to Love and to Mourn\\", p. 184.

He was the Rector of the University of Innsbruck and the Provincial of the Austrian Province of the Society of Jesus.  Philosophy  Coreth specialises in metaphysics, philosophical anthropology, and history of philosophy. He is considered one of the philosophers who sought the creative recovery of Thomas Aquinas' metaphysics through the transcendental method introduced by Joseph Mar√©chal. Particularly, Coreth and other theologians attempted to revive the metaphysics of realism (Aristotelian-Thomistic metaphysics) by addressing the failure of Kantian philosophy using its presuppositions. One of Coreth's most important works was Metaphysik where he wrote about the Christian metaphysics of Being so that it presented a completely transcendentally reformulated version. This book also refuted critics such as Etienne Gilson, who argued that transcendental turn among Thomists can only lead to phenomenalism or idealism. Coreth maintained that instead of having an objective, metaphysics only has a subjective function. Here, metaphysics loses its foundation in being but Coreth said that \\"our a priori knowledge is metaphysical knowledge of being, which opens for us the absolute horizon of being as such.\\"  Books  * Das dialektische Sein in Hegels Logik.

Howard Miller's \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster from 1943 \\"We Can Do It!\\" is an American World War II wartime poster produced by J. Howard Miller in 1943 for Westinghouse Electric as an inspirational image to boost female worker morale. The poster was little seen during World War II. It was rediscovered in the early 1980s and widely reproduced in many forms, often called \\"We Can Do It!\\" but also called \\"Rosie the Riveter\\" after the iconic figure of a strong female war production worker. The \\"We Can Do It!\\" image was used to promote feminism and other political issues beginning in the 1980s. Also available through Highbeam. The image made the cover of the Smithsonian magazine in 1994 and was fashioned into a US first-class mail stamp in 1999. It was incorporated in 2008 into campaign materials for several American politicians, and was reworked by an artist in 2010 to celebrate the first woman becoming prime minister of Australia. The poster is one of the ten most-requested images at the National Archives and Records Administration. After its rediscovery, observers often assumed that the image was always used as a call to inspire women workers to join the war effort. However, during the war the image was strictly internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women to work harder. People have seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent message to remake the image into many different forms, including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies. After she saw the Smithsonian cover image in 1994, Geraldine Hoff Doyle mistakenly said that she was the subject of the poster. Doyle thought that she had also been captured in a wartime photograph of a woman factory worker, and she innocently assumed that this photo inspired Miller's poster. Conflating her as \\"Rosie the Riveter\\", Doyle was honored by many organizations including the Michigan Women's Historical Center and Hall of Fame. However, in 2015, the woman in the wartime photograph was identified as then 20-year-old Naomi Parker, working in early 1942 before Doyle had graduated from high school. Doyle's notion that the photograph inspired the poster cannot be proved or disproved, so neither Doyle nor Parker can be confirmed as the model for \\"We Can Do It!\\" Background GM After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government called upon manufacturers to produce greater amounts of war goods. The workplace atmosphere at large factories was often tense because of resentment built up between management and labor unions throughout the 1930s. Directors of companies such as General Motors (GM) sought to minimize past friction and encourage teamwork. In response to a rumored public relations campaign by the United Auto Workers union, GM quickly produced a propaganda poster in 1942 showing both labor and management rolling up their sleeves, aligned toward maintaining a steady rate of war production. The poster read, \\"Together We Can Do It!\\" and \\"Keep 'Em Firing!\\"Bird/Rubenstein 1998, p. 58 . In creating such posters, corporations wished to increase production by tapping popular pro-war sentiment, with the ultimate goal of preventing the government from exerting greater control over production. =J. Howard Miller= J. Howard Miller was an American graphic artist. He painted posters during World War II in support of the war effort, among them the famous \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster. Aside from the iconic poster, Miller remains largely unknown. Little has been written about Miller's life, and the year of his birth and death are uncertain. His life span has been published as \\"ca. 1915 ‚Äì ca. 1990\\", \\"ca. 1915 ‚Äì 1990\\", and \\"1918‚Äì2004\\" Miller studied at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, graduating in 1939. He lived in Pittsburgh during the war. His work came to the attention of the Westinghouse Company (later, the Westinghouse War Production Co-Ordinating Committee), and he was hired to create a series of posters. The posters were sponsored by the company's internal War Production Co-Ordinating Committee, one of the hundreds of labor-management committees organized under the supervision of the national War Production Board. =Westinghouse Electric= In 1942, Miller was hired by Westinghouse Electric's internal War Production Coordinating Committee, through an advertising agency, to create a series of posters to display to the company's workers. The intent of the poster project was to raise worker morale, to reduce absenteeism, to direct workers' questions to management, and to lower the likelihood of labor unrest or a factory strike. Each of the more than 42 posters designed by Miller was displayed in the factory for two weeks, then replaced by the next one in the series. Most of the posters featured men; they emphasized traditional roles for men and women. One of the posters pictured a smiling male manager with the words \\"Any Questions About Your Work? ... Ask your Supervisor.\\" Another poster by J. Howard Miller from the same series as \\"We Can Do It!\\" No more than 1,800 copies of the 17-by-22-inch (559 by 432 mm) \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster were printed. It was not initially seen beyond several Westinghouse factories in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the midwestern U.S., where it was scheduled to be displayed for two five-day work weeks starting Monday, February 15, 1943. Search results for catalog number 1985.0851.05. The targeted factories were making plasticized helmet liners impregnated with Micarta, a phenolic resin invented by Westinghouse. Mostly women were employed in this enterprise, which yielded some 13 million helmet liners over the course of the war. Excerpted from: The slogan \\"We Can Do It!\\" was probably not interpreted by the factory workers as empowering to women alone; they had been subjected to a series of paternalistic, controlling posters promoting management authority, employee capability and company unity, and the workers would likely have understood the image to mean \\"Westinghouse Employees Can Do It\\", all working together. The upbeat image served as gentle propaganda to boost employee morale and keep production from lagging. The badge on the \\"We Can Do It!\\" worker's collar identifies her as a Westinghouse Electric plant floor employee; the pictured red, white and blue clothing was a subtle call to patriotism, one of the frequent tactics of corporate war production committees. Rosie the Riveter During World War II, the \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster was not connected to the 1942 song \\"Rosie the Riveter\\", nor to the widely seen Norman Rockwell painting called Rosie the Riveter that appeared on the cover of the Memorial Day issue of the Saturday Evening Post, May 29, 1943. The Westinghouse poster was not associated with any of the women nicknamed \\"Rosie\\" who came forward to promote women working for war production on the home front. Rather, after being displayed for two weeks in February 1943 to some Westinghouse factory workers, it disappeared for nearly four decades. Other \\"Rosie\\" images prevailed, often photographs of actual workers. The Office of War Information geared up for a massive nationwide advertising campaign to sell the war, but \\"We Can Do It!\\" was not part of it. Rockwell's emblematic Rosie the Riveter painting was loaned by the Post to the U.S. Treasury Department for use in posters and campaigns promoting war bonds. Following the war, the Rockwell painting gradually sank from public memory because it was copyrighted; all of Rockwell's paintings were vigorously defended by his estate after his death. This protection resulted in the original painting gaining value‚Äîit sold for nearly $5 million in 2002. Conversely, the lack of protection for the \\"We Can Do It!\\" image is one of the reasons it experienced a rebirth. Ed Reis, a volunteer historian for Westinghouse, noted that the original image was not shown to female riveters during the war, so the recent association with \\"Rosie the Riveter\\" was unjustified. Rather, it was targeted at women who were making helmet liners out of Micarta. Reis joked that the woman in the image was more likely to have been named \\"Molly the Micarta Molder or Helen the Helmet Liner Maker.\\" Rediscovery An example of commercial use on a pair of vending machines for bottled water In 1982, the \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster was reproduced in a magazine article, \\"Poster Art for Patriotism's Sake\\", a Washington Post Magazine article about posters in the collection of the National Archives. In subsequent years, the poster was re-appropriated to promote feminism. Feminists saw in the image an embodiment of female empowerment. The \\"We\\" was understood to mean \\"We Women\\", uniting all women in a sisterhood fighting against gender inequality. This was very different from the poster's 1943 use to control employees and to discourage labor unrest. History professor Jeremiah Axelrod commented on the image's combination of femininity with the \\"masculine (almost macho) composition and body language.\\" Smithsonian magazine put the image on its cover in March 1994, to invite the viewer to read a featured article about wartime posters. The US Postal Service created a 33¬¢ stamp in February 1999 based on the image, with the added words \\"Women Support War Effort\\". A Westinghouse poster from 1943 was put on display at the National Museum of American History, part of the exhibit showing items from the 1930s and '40s. Wire service photograph upright In 1984, former war worker Geraldine Hoff Doyle came across an article in Modern Maturity magazine which showed a wartime photograph of a young woman working at a lathe, and she assumed that the photograph was taken of her in mid-to-late 1942 when she was working briefly in a factory. Ten years later, Doyle saw the \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster on the front of the Smithsonian magazine and assumed the poster was an image of herself. Without intending to profit from the connection, Doyle decided that the 1942 wartime photograph had inspired Miller to create the poster, making Doyle herself the model for the poster. Subsequently, Doyle was widely credited as the inspiration for Miller's poster. From an archive of Acme news photographs, Professor James J. Kimble obtained the original photographic print, including its yellowed caption identifying the woman as Naomi Parker. The photo is one of a series of photographs taken at Naval Air Station Alameda in California, showing Parker and her sister working at their war jobs during March 1942. These images were published in various newspapers and magazines beginning in April 1942, during a time when Doyle was still attending high school in Michigan. In February 2015, Kimble interviewed the Parker sisters, now named Naomi Fern Fraley, 93, and her sister Ada Wyn Morford, 91, and found that they had known for five years about the incorrect identification of the photo, and had been rebuffed in their attempt to correct the historical record. Naomi Parker Fraley died age 96 on January 20, 2018. Although many publications have repeated Doyle's unsupported assertion that the wartime photograph inspired Miller's poster, Westinghouse historian Charles A. Ruch, a Pittsburgh resident who had been friends with J. Howard Miller, said that Miller was not in the habit of working from photographs, but rather live models. However, the photograph of Naomi Parker did appear in the Pittsburgh Press on July 5, 1942, making it possible that Miller saw it as he was creating the poster. Legacy The \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster was used by the Ad Council for its 70th anniversary celebration, through a Facebook app called \\"Rosify Yourself\\". Today, the image has become very widely known, far beyond its narrowly defined purpose during WWII. It has adorned T-shirts, tattoos, coffee cups and refrigerator magnets‚Äîso many different products that the Washington Post called it the \\"most over-exposed\\" souvenir item available in Washington, D.C. It was used in 2008 by some of the various regional campaigners working to elect Sarah Palin, Ron Paul and Hillary Clinton. Michelle Obama was worked into the image by some attendees of the 2010 Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear. The image has been employed by corporations such as Clorox who used it in advertisements for household cleaners, the pictured woman provided in this instance with a wedding ring on her left hand. Parodies of the image have included famous women, men, animals and fictional characters. A bobblehead doll and an action figure toy have been produced. The Children's Museum of Indianapolis showed a replica made by artist Kristen Cumings from thousands of Jelly Belly candies. After Julia Gillard became the first female prime minister of Australia in June 2010, a Melbourne street artist calling himself Phoenix pasted Gillard's face into a new monochrome version of the \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster. AnOther Magazine published a photograph of the poster taken on Hosier Lane, Melbourne, in July 2010, showing that the original \\"War Production Co-ordinating Committee\\" mark in the lower right had been replaced with a URL pointing to Phoenix's Flickr photostream. In March 2011, Phoenix produced a color version which stated \\"She Did It!\\" in the lower right, then in January 2012 he pasted \\"Too Sad\\" diagonally across the poster to represent his disappointment with developments in Australian politics. Geraldine Doyle died in December 2010. Utne Reader went ahead with their scheduled January‚ÄìFebruary 2011 cover image: a parody of \\"We Can Do It!\\" featuring Marge Simpson raising her right hand in a fist. The editors of the magazine expressed regret at the passing of Doyle. A stereoscopic (3D) image of \\"We Can Do It!\\" was created for the closing credits of the 2011 superhero film Captain America: The First Avenger. The image served as the background for the title card of English actress Hayley Atwell. The Ad Council claimed the poster was developed in 1942 by its precursor, the War Advertising Committee, as part of a \\"Women in War Jobs\\" campaign, helping to bring \\"over two million women\\" into war production. In February 2012 during the Ad Council's 70th anniversary celebration, an interactive application designed by Animax's HelpsGood digital agency was linked to the Ad Council's Facebook page. The Facebook app was called \\"Rosify Yourself\\", referring to Rosie the Riveter; it allowed viewers to upload images of their faces to be incorporated into the \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster, then saved to be shared with friends. Ad Council President and CEO Peggy Conlon posted her own \\"Rosified\\" face on Huffington Post in an article she wrote about the group's 70-year history. The staff of the television show Today posted two \\"Rosified\\" images on their website, using the faces of news anchors Matt Lauer and Ann Curry. However, Seton Hall University professor James J. Kimble and University of Pittsburgh professor Lester C. Olson researched the origins of the poster and determined that it was not produced by the Ad Council nor was it used for recruiting women workers. In 2010, American singer P!nk featured this poster in her Raise Your Glass music video. P!nk recreates the poster wearing the same clothing and doing the same pose as in the poster.

He received his Juris Doctor from Seton Hall University School of Law in 1994. He served as a law clerk for Justice James H. Coleman of the New Jersey Supreme Court from 1994 to 1995. From 1995 to 2003, he worked as an associate at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP in Newark, New Jersey. From 2003 to 2007, he worked in the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General, first as an Assistant Attorney General in charge of Consumer Protection and later as Counsel to the Attorney General. In 2007, he was appointed as a United States Magistrate Judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, holding that position until his elevation to District Judge on that court. He is the brother of former NFL player, Marcel Shipp. Justice Shipp is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Federal judicial service On January 23, 2012, President Obama nominated Shipp to be a United States District Judge for the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey to the seat vacated by Judge Mary Little Cooper who took senior status in 2011. He received a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 14, 2012 and his nomination was reported to the floor on April 19, 2012, by voice vote, with Senator Lee recorded as voting no based on unrelated general principles. Despite the relatively uncontroversial nature of Shipp's nomination, Senator Rand Paul in July 2012 held up allowing an up-or-down, Senate floor vote on Shipp's nomination over an unrelated issue, involving Paul's desire to cut off all U.S. aid to Pakistan unless authorities there release Dr. Shakil Afridi. In a Senate floor speech on July 19, 2012, Paul announced his intention to hold up all Senate business until receiving a satisfactory answer to his question about why a Pakistani judicial panel has delayed Afridi's appeal of his conviction on charges related to assistance he provided to the CIA in the capture of Osama bin Laden. Paul also said he intended to seek a vote to terminate all aid to Pakistan. On July 19, 2012, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid moved to invoke cloture on confirming Shipp's nomination. The cloture vote on July 23, 2012 was vitiated when Paul consented to a confirmation vote on the nomination. Shipp's nomination was confirmed that same day by a vote of 91 ayes to 1 nay, Senator Mike Lee again casting the sole no vote. He received his commission on July 26, 2012.

Goodrich and directed by James P. Hogan for B.P. Schulberg and his company Preferred Pictures. The film stars Alyce Mills, and represents an early role for actress Clara Bow. It is the tenth ever film for William Powell (better known for his later work in talking pictures), and the first of only two films where Powell and Bow worked together. The film was for years believed to be a lost film, but a full 16mm nitrate print survives and is preserved at UCLA Film and Television Archive. Considered a \\"Silent Classic\\", the film was remastered by the National Film Preservation Foundation. The film screened in Italy in 2003 at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival. Plot Newspaper magnate Forbes Lombard (Frank Keenan) discovers that his daughter Lola (Clara Bow) is mixed up with a gang of gamblers. Reporter Scott Seldon (William Powell) pretends to be a felon and goes undercover to infiltrate the mob and get a news scoop. He falls in love with the gang's leader, female crook Dora Blake (Alyce Mills). The two are captured in a police raid and under extreme questioning are forced to sign confessions.

It is named for Jacques Monod (1910 ‚Äì 1976, a French biochemist, Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1965), who proposed using an equation of this form to relate microbial growth rates in an aqueous environment to the concentration of a limiting nutrient. The Monod equation has the same form as the Michaelis‚ÄìMenten equation, but differs in that it is empirical while the latter is based on theoretical considerations. The Monod equation is commonly used in environmental engineering. For example, it is used in the activated sludge model for sewage treatment.  Equation  The specific growth rate Œº as a function of the limiting substrate concentration S. The empirical Monod equation is: : \\\\mu = \\\\mu_\\\\max {S \\\\over K_s + S} where: * Œº is the specific growth rate of the microorganisms * Œºmax is the maximum specific growth rate of the microorganisms * S is the concentration of the limiting substrate for growth * Ks is the \\"half-velocity constant\\"‚Äîthe value of S when Œº/Œºmax = 0.5 Œºmax and Ks are empirical coefficients to the Monod equation. They will differ between microorganism species and will also depend on the ambient environmental conditions.  Application notes  The rate of substrate utilization is related to the specific growth rate as follows: : rsu = ‚àíŒºX/Y where: * X is the total biomass (since the specific growth rate, Œº is normalized to the total biomass) * Y is the yield coefficient rsu is negative by convention. In some applications, multiple terms of the form [S/(Ks + S)] are multiplied together where more than one nutrient or growth factor has the potential to be limiting (e.g. organic matter and oxygen are both necessary to heterotrophic bacteria). When the yield coefficient, being the ratio of mass of microorganisms to mass of substrate utilized, becomes very large this signifies that there is deficiency of substrate available for utilization.

The violence has escalated into the current 2014 Libyan Civil War. The militias include guerrillas, Islamists, and militias who fought against Gaddafi but refused to lay down their arms when the war ended in October 2011. According to some civilian leaders, these latter militias shifted from merely delaying the surrender of their weapons to actively asserting a continuing political role as \\"guardians of the revolution\\". Some of the largest, and most well-equipped militias are associated with Islamist groups now forming political parties. Before the official end of hostilities between loyalist and opposition forces, there were reports of sporadic clashes between rival militias, and vigilante revenge killings. In September 2012, Islamists attacked the United States consulate building in Benghazi, killing the US ambassador and three others. This prompted a popular outcry against semi-legal militias that were still operating and resulted in the storming of several Islamist militia bases by protesters. A large-scale government crackdown followed on non-government sanctioned militias, with the Libyan Army raiding several now illegal militias' headquarters and ordering them to disband.  Events  = 2011 =  November 2011 On 1 November, a group of intoxicated Zintan fighters stormed a hospital in Tripoli and demanded they hand-over of a fighter who was wounded earlier in the day in a clash that also left another militiaman dead. The doctors refused and a Tripoli militia, in charge of hospital security, forced the Zintanis out, but not before they shot rounds in the hospital. Both groups received reinforcements and the fighting, involving heavy machine guns and anti-aircraft guns, lasted for three hours. There were no direct fatalities from the fighting, but three patients at the hospital died due to stress-related causes linked to the clashes. Three Tripoli fighters were wounded. The fighting reportedly ended after calls from a local imam and senior commanders from both groups talked by phone with their men. On 8 November, it was evident that loyalist remnants were also still active in the country, even more than two weeks after their defeat, when a pro-Gaddafi convoy tried to cross the border into Niger and was intercepted by the Nigerien army. 13 loyalists and one Nigerien soldier were killed. Between 8 and 12 November, large-scale fighting erupted between Zawiya and Tripoli between a Zawiya-based militia and a group from the Wershifanna tribe. The Zawiya group accused their opponents of belonging to loyalist remnants and they reported seeing tanks and vehicles with the Gaddafi-era green flag and markings that said \\"Brigade of the Martyr Muammar Gaddafi\\". The Wershifanna denied this and stated that the men from Zawiya had been misled by a rumor that pro-Gaddafi fighters were in the area. The fighting was centered around the former loyalist Imaya military base and both sides vied for control. Grad rocket launchers were used at times during the clashes. 9‚Äì12 Zawiya fighters and nine Wershifanna fighters were killed. On 23 November, a militia force in Bani Walid was ambushed after being sent there to arrest a known Gaddafi supporter. 15 militia members were killed. The survivors reported being shot at and hit with grenades and rockets from houses after they found out all the roads were blocked. Another report stated that the fighting started after a high-speed chase with a suspect vehicle in which a Gaddafi loyalist was killed. One civilian also reportedly died during the fighting.  December 2011 In early December, a group of Zintani gunmen attacked the convoy of a top army officer, General Khalifa Haftar, as it was speeding through a checkpoint set up by the group. In a separate incident, gunfire broke out between the army and the Zintan brigade at the Tripoli International Airport. On 16 December, Haftar said an armed group had abducted his son, Belgassim, and detained him at the airport. On 6 December, Libya's interim government announced that, following consultations with Tripoli's local council, it had given militias lingering in the capital until late December to hand over security to the authorities. Officials said residents of Tripoli would convene rallies in support of the initiative to clear the city of weapons and out-of- town fighters. If militias had not withdrawn by 20 December, the authorities and members of the public intended to close the whole city to traffic. By January 2012, the former rebels had dismantled most of their checkpoints, while some key bases still remained. On 11 December, fighting erupted south of Zintan, between the Zintan militia and members of the El-Mashasha tribe. The clashes started when the El-Mashasha attacked the convoy of a Zintan militia commander, killing him, as he tried to pass through the town of Wamis, around which the tribe was based. The Zintanis retaliated by attacking the town with artillery or rocket fire, hitting houses in residential areas. A mosque and a school were also hit. Over two days of fighting three townspeople were killed. By 13 December, a ceasefire was established. Officials from Zintan stated that the fighting was the result of the El-Mashasha killing several residents of Zintan earlier in week. = 2012 =  January 2012  On 3 January, four fighters were killed in a gun battle in Tripoli as dozens of fighters from Misrata were trying to seize a group of prisoners being held in a security compound by Tripoli militias. Another report stated that there were two separate gun battles and put the number of dead at seven. In response to the incident, NTC chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil warned that Libya risked sliding into civil war if the rival militias were not brought under control. On 14 January, two fighters were killed and 36 were injured after clashes between militias from neighbouring towns of Gharyan and Asbi'a. It was reported that artillery and rockets were used during the clashes. On 15 January, the rival groups carried out a prisoner swap and agreed to a ceasefire. Officials said 12 people had been killed and around 100 wounded on both sides. In the days leading up to the fighting, the Asbi'a commander assigned to Gharyan, Ezzedine al-Ghool, was detained and tortured to death by members of the Gharyan militia. His body was dropped off anonymously at a hospital in Tripoli. On 20 January, Libya's former ambassador to France died less than a day after he was arrested by a Tripoli militia group. Human Rights Watch said on 3 February, that marks on Omar Brebesh's body suggested he died as a result of torture while he was in detention. On 22 January, a new clash broke out in Tripoli when NTC fighters attempted to arrest a former prisoner, charged with murder, who was released by the Gaddafi government at the start of the civil war the previous year. He and his brother took shelter in their home and opened fire on the militia with RPGs and automatic weapons. Both brothers and an NTC fighter were killed and five militiamen were wounded. On 26 January, the humanitarian aid non-governmental organization M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (which had been present in Misrata since April 2011, during the Libyan Civil War) announced the suspension of their work in the city detention centres, as detainees were tortured and denied urgent health care. MSF General Director Christopher Stokes stated: \\"Patients were brought to us in the middle of interrogation for medical care, in order to make them fit for more interrogation. This is unacceptable. Our role is to provide medical care to war casualties and sick detainees, not to repeatedly treat the same patients between torture sessions.\\". Amnesty International had described two days ago \\"widespread torture and ill-treatment of suspected pro-Gadhafi fighters and loyalists.\\", with several detainees dying across Libya in the precedent weeks. ;Bani Walid clashes Uprising started in Bani Walid on 23 January 2012 due to an incident in the city of Bani Walid in which the \\"May 28 Brigade\\" militia wished to arrest local men in unclear circumstances. The May 28 Brigade and their compound were then attacked by local fighters who then took control of the town.  February 2012  On 6 February, seven male black Libyan civilians from Tawergha were killed by militias who raided their makeshift refugee camp at a former naval academy in Janzour, a suburb of Tripoli. The survivors said that they appeared to be from Misrata because of their license plates, though the Misrata militia denied this. ;Kufra clashes On 12 February, conflict erupted between Zuwayya and Toubou tribesmen in southern town of Kufra. This conflict lasted several months and led to government military intervention which started uneasy truce between two tribes. On 15 February, Amnesty International reported that at least 12 detainees had been tortured to death while in militia custody.  March 2012  On 2 March, the head of the security committee in Derna, Colonel Mohammed Al-Hassi, was shot and killed outside a petrol station in the town. He had previously survived two earlier assassination attempts and was also the head of Derna's anti-drugs unit. He cracked down hard on local drug smugglers during and before the civil war. On 6 March, tribal and militia leaders in Benghazi declared unilaterally semi-autonomy for the eastern region of Cyrenaica. This was met with anger from the NTC government in Tripoli and anti-autonomy demonstrations erupted in the capital and Benghazi. On 16 March, a pro-autonomy demonstration was held in Benghazi, which was attacked by unknown gunmen, leaving one person dead and five injured. On 18 March, a clash erupted between the Zintan militia and residents of Tripoli's Abu Salim district, previously loyal to Gaddafi. One militiaman was killed before a cease-fire was brokered by the district's own militia commander.Libya ruler says militias should not control government buildings; 1 killed in Tripoli clash ;Sabha clashes Late on 25 March, clashes erupted in the southern city of Sabha, between Arab and Toubou tribesmen, after a man from the Abu Seif tribe was killed in a dispute over a car by the Toubou which lasted for one week.  April 2012  ;Zuwara clashes On 1 April, 21‚Äì34 Zuwara militiamen were detained by members of a neighboring town's militia. The Ragdalein fighters stated that they captured the men after months of abuses by a Zuwara brigade, including the looting of property. For their part, the Zuwara local council head accused Ragdalein to be a hub of Gaddafi loyalists. A third version of the events came from the government Interior Ministry which stated that the trouble started when a Zuwara hunting party near Al-Jumail shot and killed a person from that town by mistake. The hunters were then arrested but released later. Another Zuwara council head claimed that the men were tortured before being released and stated that Zuwara came under mortar and anti-aircraft fire by militias from both Ragdalein and Al-Jumail. On 3 April, reports emerged that the fighting in the Zuwara area was still continuing with at least one Zuwara militiaman killed and five wounded. The losses for Ragdalein and Al-Jumail were not known. Clashes were reported at the entrance to Ragdalein while Al-Jumail was shelling Zuwara. At least 14 were killed and 80 injured. On 4 April, the fighting escalated with the use of tanks and artillery. The reported number of dead was said to had risen to 26, eight from Zuwara and 18 from the outlying towns, and another 142 Zuwarans were wounded. Unconfirmed reports rose up the death toll to 48 killed in the clashes.The situation in Libya UN Security Council, 6768th meeting, 10 May 2012. On 6 April, French leading newspaper Le Figaro reported that a dozen people were killed near Ghat on 1 and 2 April in fighting between former pro-Gaddafi Tuaregs and the Zintan tribe. On 20 April, fighting restarted in Kufra with 12 people being killed and more than 35 wounded when the Tobu fighters were reportedly attacked by units under the command of the Libyan National Army. The fighting began when a Tobu tribesman was killed by members of the Zuwayya tribe. The battles lasted late into 21 April.  May 2012  On 8 May, protests outside prime minister office turned violent when ex-rebels, which protested on the non-payment of the promised cash handout by the government, attacked the office in Tripoli. One Interior Ministry's Supreme Security Committee (SSC) guard was killed, while four others, one protester and three SSC guards, were injured. On 15 May, a diplomatic source briefed by Western intelligence officials stated that, beside the tribal rivalries plaguing the country, there was concern about a growing presence of Islamist militants in some areas, specifically the city of Derna. The source said that hundreds of Islamist militants were in and around the town, and there were militant training camps where weapons were also provided. He said one official had described the area as \\"a disaster zone.\\" Tensions had reportedly grown between local people and the militants. According to the source, the previous month, a number of town residents went to a camp on the outskirts of the city and forced militants to leave. One of the indicators of the militant inter-factional were also the recent spate of car-bombings in Derna. One of the attacks targeted Abdel Hakim al Hasadi, a former member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. The same day, two people were killed and a third wounded in intertribal clashes in Sorman. On 16 May, fighting erupted between Tuareg tribesmen and local militiamen over control of a checkpoint on the edge of Ghadames on a desert route often used for smuggling, near the Algerian border. Between seven and thirteen people were killed and more than 20 wounded. Per one local official, except one person, all of the dead were Tuaregs.  June 2012  On 5 June, a militia checkpoint in Gwarsha district was attacked and destroyed by the family of a member of the security forces who had been fatally shot earlier by a militiaman at the checkpoint. On 6 June, one person was shot and killed in Sirte, purportedly by anti-Gaddafi gunmen who thought the man was a loyalist. Between 11 and 17 June, clashes raged in the town of Zintan. Zintani militiamen were involved in fighting with members of the El-Mashasha tribe, whom they accuse of being Gaddafi loyalists because they did not join the opposition during the civil war the previous year. The fighting reportedly started when a Zintani militiaman was shot and killed at an El-Mashasha checkpoint. At the same time, a security patrol came under fire in Sabha, leaving two dead and 10 wounded. Armed clashes also flared anew in Kufra, leaving one dead and dozens injured. After days of clashes, on 17 June, the Libyan government declared the area around Zintan a military zone and sent troops to stop the fighting. The total casualty toll for the fighting in the Zintan area was ultimately stated to be 105 killed and more than 500 wounded. The majority of the dead were reported to be El-Mashasha. The tribesmen accused the Zintan forces of shelling their town, Sheguiga, with tank and rocket fire.  July 2012  On 6 July, a helicopter carrying election material was shot at south of Benghazi killing an election worker. On 28 July, Colonel Bouzyreda Sleiman, a former military intelligence agent who defected to the opposition during the civil war, was shot and killed in Benghazi as he was performing the Taraweeh prayers at the Amer Bin Yas mosque. Other former Benghazi interior security officers, as Abdelhamid Kandouz Ali or non- commissioned officer Ibrahim Al-Arabi, were killed several days before by car bombs. On 29 July, commander of Libyan ground forces Khalifa Hafter escaped an assassination attempt in Benghazi, when his convoy get under fire from unknown assailants. Abdel-Basit Haroun, a Benghazi militia commander, declared that only during the past month thirteen people who had been close to the former government had been killed. Also in Benghazi, a bomb planted at the Tibesti hotel was defused before it could explode.  August 2012  On 1 August, clashes in Abu Isa (between Zawiya and Sorman) between armed gangs who were fighting over some vehicles since the day before ended with the intervention of the Libya Shield Force, with a final toll between two and four killed, and five injured. On 10 August, another former Libyan Army officer who was among the first defecting to the opposition, Brigadier General Mohamed Hadia al- Feitouri, was shot and killed in Benghazi. Hadia, then defence ministry official responsible for ammunition and weapons, was returning home from Friday prayers when a group of gunmen pulled up in a car and opened fire on him. On 19 August, two people were killed in a two independent car bomb attacks in Tripoli. They are the first fatal bomb attacks since the fall of the Gaddafi regime.Libya blasts: Two killed in Tripoli car bombings . BBC.co.uk (19 August 2012). Retrieved 2012-09-30.

Exclusive ‚Äì Interior Ministry communications system hacked as Qaddafi loyalists overheard discussing Tripoli blasts. Libya Herald. Retrieved 2012-09-30. On 23 August, tribal clashes with heavy weapons (between Awlad Al- Shaikh tribesmen and Zlitenis according to some sources, and between Al-Haly and Al-Fawatra tribes according to others) started in Zliten, killing between three and twelve people, and injuring dozens. In a separate development, Interior ministry spokesman Abdelmonem al-Hur stated that more than a hundred tanks and twenty-six rocket launchers were seized from an alleged pro-Gaddafi militia (named Katibat Al-Awfiyah, or Brigade of the Faithful), during a raid on their campsite in Tarhuna. The operation ended with one of the suspects killed, eight wounded and thirteen detainees, accused of being linked with the 19 August Tripoli bombings. In Homs, east of Tripoli, a women's hunger strike over conditions at a migrants camp was suppressed by anti-Gaddafi militia members, leaving three Sub-Saharan migrants dead, according to Eritrean Roman Catholic priest Moses Zerai. In Sabha, two African migrants were killed and several others wounded when unknown assailants threw an explosive device at the home where they stayed. On 24 August, following the deadly clashes of the day before, the shrine of Sufi scholar Sidi Abd As-Salam Al-Asmar in Zliten (which had been target of an earlier attack in March) was destroyed by Salafist groups using a bulldozer and explosives, according to Zlitan military council official Omar Ali and witnesses. The attackers have also blown up the mosque attached to it and its library, filmed the events and posted the footage online. On 25 August, the Al-Shaab Al-Dahmani mosque and shrine in central Tripoli was bulldozed in broad daylight by a group of armed Salafists, including members of the security forces. According to witnesses, when the police came, they prevented people from approaching instead of stopping the demolition, while an anonymous government officer alleged that after a small clash they sealed the area to prevent violence from spreading. One of the assailants affirmed that the Interior Ministry had authorised the operation after discovering practices of worshipping and \\"black magic\\" at the shrine. According to witnesses, the Sheikh Ahmad Zarruq mausoleum in the port of Misrata was also destroyed. On 26 August, several Libyan government officials as President of the General National Congress Mohamed Yousef el-Magariaf, or Supreme Military Council spokesman Abdel Moneim al-Hurr condemned the demolition. Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur stated on Twitter: \\"The destruction of shrines and mosques is a crime. Those who commit these crimes will be held responsible‚Ä¶ I asked the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence to intervene yesterday but they did not do their duty to protect these sites.\\" The Grand Mufti of Libya Sheikh Sadik Al-Ghariani condemned the desecration of graves and holy sites, which he described as \\"not religiously permissible\\" and \\"a violation of the sanctity of the dead\\". International non-governmental organizations (like HRW or ANHRI) and UNESCO also denounced the attacks.  September 2012  On 2 September, clashes between two rival young men groups in Zawiya for the theft of a car resulted in seven killed and thirteen injured, ending with the intervention of local security forces. The same day, the joint venture between AGOCO and Repsol announced a halt on oil production at the Akakus fields in the Murzuq basin, following an attack on some company personnel by the guards of the complex. In Benghazi, a car bomb exploded in Gamal Abdel Nasser street, at the center of the city, killing a Colonel of the former government security services and wounding the other passenger. While at first Supreme Security Committee spokesman Abdel Moneim al-Hurr said that the driver was carrying the bombing device, he later affirmed that the two men, both intelligence officers, had been the target of the explosion. Between 3 and 4 September, a group of Wershifanna tribesmen located a fake checkpoint at the Zahra bridge, in the road between Tripoli and Aziziya, killing between one and three travellers and kidnapping seven others from the Nafusa mountains. On Tuesday 4 September, an agreement was made with the group fleeing the checkpoint and releasing the hostages in exchange for the liberation of a Wershifanna man accused of car theft. On 7 September, a Salafist militia attacked the Sidi Al-Lafi mausoleum in Rajma. In the clashes with local residents that followed, three militiamen were killed and seven people were injured, according to Interior Ministry sources.

The Aztec social classes grew incredibly sophisticated and complex once the Mexica people settled and began to build their empire. It's been said that the class structure was so elaborate that it impressed the Spanish almost as much as the architecture of the empire. The Mexica people, who later became the nucleus of the Aztec empire, were for a time a nomadic tribe looking for a home. As they moved south, they came into contact with advanced peoples. Many cultures of the day looked back to the impressive culture of the Toltecs, and the Aztecs came to admire the Toltec heritage. In fact, eventually the word for artistic creations would be toltecayotl, for the Toltecs, and the Aztecs themselves would claim to be descended from the great Toltec nobles. The Mexicans were anxious to claim a Toltec heritage, so they chose a nobleman of Toltec origin as their first king, a man named Acamapichtli. He fathered a great many children by 20 wives, and his descendants became the heart of a new social class in the empire - the nobles or pipiltin (singular pilli). From then on, a king would always be chosen from among the pipiltin. Basically, the ruling positions were not hereditary, but preference was given to those in the \\"royal families\\". Originally the pipiltin status was not hereditary, although the sons of pillis had access to better resources and education, so it was easier for them to become pillis. Later the class system took on hereditary aspects. The nobles had many other privileges. They generally received a fuller education, they were allowed to wear fancier clothes and decorate their houses. They were allowed to hold important government offices. But not all had positions of authority - some were craftsmen, or even palace servants. Those who served with distinction could move up the ranks. The second class were the macehualtin (people), originally peasants. Eduardo NogueraAnnals of Anthropology, UNAM, Vol. xi, 1974, p. 56 estimates that in later stages only 20% of the population was dedicated to agriculture and food production. The other 80% of society were warriors, artisans and traders.Sanders, William T., Settlement Patterns in Central Mexico. Handbook of Middle American Indians, 1971, vol. 3, p. 3-44. Slaves or tlacotin also constituted an important class. Aztecs could become slaves because of debts, as a criminal punishment, or as war captives. A slave could have possessions and even own other slaves. Slavery in Aztec society was in some ways more humane than in Western cultures. While some slaves were punished criminals or prisoners of war, others sold themselves or their children into slavery due to economic hardship. Slaves could free themselves by repaying their purchase price. They could marry and own property, and their children were born free.http://slaveryinjustice.wordpress.com/slavery-in-ancient-aztec-mayan-and- inca/ Traveling merchants called pochteca were a small, but important class as they not only facilitated commerce, but also communicated vital information across the empire and beyond its borders. They were often employed as spies.

The schools are all located in the city's University Heights neighborhood which borders downtown. The institutions that make up CHEN are organized as an unincorporated association. CHEN was founded with two purposes in mind, the first of which is to foster internal cooperation among the four institutions with regard to research and educational opportunities for their respective populations. The second objective is to contribute to the ongoing revitalization of University Heights, and, more broadly, to the economic development of Newark, and the northern New Jersey region in general. The day-time population of the CHEN schools is close to 50,000, about 37,000 of whom are degree candidates. Together, as of 2009, they occupy over of land on which sits 12.1 million plus square-feet of usable space, along with 12,000 plus parking spaces. The real estate held by the CHEN institutions was valued at 2.8 billion dollars under 2009 assessments. The CHEN institutions account for billions of dollars in annual expenditures, the bulk of which enters Newark's economy. With nearly 13,000 employees in total, they rank among the biggest employers in Essex County and in the state itself. Their collective payroll for 2009 was more than 780 million dollars, of which close to 10% went to the roughly 2000 employees who reside in Newark. Among these are 500 employees who live in University Heights. Collectively, these 500 employees earn approximately 18 million dollars annually. The general purpose of CHEN is to use this considerable economic weight, first to advance the well being of the people in the region it presently serves, and second, to expand the region served. CHEN's impact is ongoing and expanding. , a 50-acre development project involving research facilities, start-up incubators, and community development initiatives, is perhaps their most visible project. Another important example is Science Park High School, an initiative that involved a broad collaboration with many partners, private and public, including Newark and its board of Education.

Designed as small parkways, they were constructed in honor of Sandusky County's eighty-five soldiers who were killed in action during World War I. Unlike many similar streets in other cities, they were not built as centerpieces for grand city plans; instead, they were constructed to provide access to a subdivision that had recently been started.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1233. Laid out in the form of a cross, the parkways run for four blocks with vegetation between the lanes for the two directions; they were completed in 1920 after a year of construction. Historic research has identified both streets as fine examples of the implementation of City Beautiful ideas in an extant city. Today, the parkways continue to provide access to a residential neighborhood; most of the houses that line the parkways are newer than the streets themselves, having been built primarily between 1930 and 1959. In 1991, the two parkways were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of their importance in community planning and in landscape architecture., Ohio Historical Society, 2007.

CCXVII, a document now in the public domain James Murray Dobson (Plymouth, England 1846 - Pescot, Longfield near Dartford, Kent, England, 27 February 1924) was a principal engineer of the Buenos Aires harbour works in the late 1880s. Early life and education Dobson was born in Plymouth the fourth of George Clarisse Dobson, M. Inst. C.E., resident engineer at Holyhead harbour in Wales, and younger brother of Henry Austin Dobson, who would become a poet. He was also a nephew of James Meadows Rendel, another noted engineer and president of the British Institution of Civil Engineers. Career Dobson served his pupilage with his father on the Holyhead harbour works for two years and with Sir John Hawkshaw for one year. From 1865 to 1885 he was one of Hawkshaw's assistants, and among the various works upon which he was engaged was the Maryport dock, of which he was engineer-in-charge. He had a large office of his own in which he prepared the designs for the Stockton bridge for Charles Neate and Harrison Hayter, and designs of the ironwork of the lines and stations of the London underground District Railway extension to Whitechapel for Sir John Hawkshaw.\\"Obituary\\", Institution of Civil Engineers (UK), vol. CCXVII Dobson went to Argentina to engineer the new Buenos Aires harbour in August 1885. He went with his staff, and two of the staff of principal contractor Thomas A. Walker. John Hawkshaw was the consulting engineer on the project.Mike Chrimes, British and Irish Civil Engineers in the Development of Argentina in the Nineteenth Century, p. 691 In 1887 he was appointed chief engineer of the Buenos Aires harbour works, a position which he held until their completion in 1901. On the retirement of Sir John Hawkshaw in 1890 he became resident partner in the firm of Hawkshaw, Hayter and Dobson, of Buenos Aires‚Äîa branch of the firm of Hawshaw and Hayter, now headed by Hawkshaw's son John Clarke Hawkshaw, of London. In 1895 he was selected by the Argentine government to act on a commission to settle the level of high-water mark in the River Plate, and in January 1900 after the death of Hayter, Dobson returned to London where he carried on a consulting practice with Clarke Hawkshaw. Hawkshaw and Dobson were consulting engineers for the: *Madras Railway until the end of the contract with the Government of India *Crown Agents for the Colonies for the Mauritius Government Railways *Midland Railway of Western Australia *West of India Portuguese Railway at Mormugao in the Portuguese colony of Goa in India * Harbour at Coatzacoalcos, in the Mexican state of Veracruz *Harbour at Salina Cruz, Oaxaca state, Mexico *Belfast harbour, Ireland *Holyhead harbour, Wales Institution of Civil Engineers Director Engineering Policy & Innovation Mike Chrimes notes in his work British and Irish Civil Engineers in the Development of Argentina in the Nineteenth Century, that the project was almost certainly the first instance of a British firm having a resident partner overseas, and that the project's success was the result of the collaboration of Dobson as engineer and Hawkshaw as consulting engineer. Hawkshaw spent three months in Argentina. Chrimes concluded that this was at least partly a reflection of the value of the works (about 7 million pounds), but perhaps also because the project was carried out in an independent state and not in a British colony. Dobson authored a book, Buenos Ayres harbour works ...: with an abstract of the discussion upon the paper, published 1899. For this contribution to the proceedings of the ICE he was awarded a Telford Premium (prize).

It premiered on ABC on January 18, 2012. The episode was written by Cindy Chupack and directed by Chris Koch. \\"Little Bo Bleep\\" despite the controversy around Lily's (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) plotline, having a toddler cursing, received positive reviews. The creator of the show, Steven Levitan, made it clear that Anderson-Emmons never really said \\"f-word\\"; instead she said \\"fudge\\". Plot The whole family is invited to a wedding and needs to be ready for the event but first they have to deal with what they have to do for the day. Claire (Julie Bowen) has a debate against Duane Bailey (David Cross) for her run for town council; Jay (Ed O'Neill) worries about Stella's (Brigitte) suicidal behavior and Cam (Eric Stonestreet) and Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) have to deal with Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) and her new habit of using the \\"f-word\\". Claire decided to run for town council (episode: Hit and Run) and she has to prepare for the upcoming debate against Duane, who is running for his seventh time. Phil (Ty Burrell) and the kids want to help her get ready, especially after a newspaper critic writes that people find her \\"angry and unlikable\\". They conduct a mock interview in the family living room, during which they all try to make her lose \\"bad\\" habits such as rolling her eyes, pointing her finger and being sarcastic. At the Pritchett house, Jay worries about his dog Stella because she keeps jumping into the pool without knowing how to swim. He blames Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) for Stella's suicidal behavior since Gloria does not love the dog and always screams at her. Lily is going to be the flower girl at the wedding and Cam and Mitch open her dress box. The blue dress, which lights up, is not as good as they expected. Out of nowhere, Lily says the \\"f-word\\", causing Cam to giggle and leave the room. Mitch and Cam try to tell her that she shouldn't say that word, however Cam keeps laughing every time she says it undermining the point. At the debate, things do not go really well for Claire. Duane brings up the incident Phil had on Valentine's Day when he went to a wrong hotel room waiting for Claire. Phil tries to defend himself but he just makes things worse and ends up getting songified on YouTube. After the debate, the whole family meets at the wedding. When Claire and Phil arrive, Cam and Mitch pretend that they did not watch the debate on TV. Cam and Mitch explain that Lily is not allowed to talk at all in order to prevent her saying the \\"f-word\\" in public. When the ceremony starts, Cam starts crying because he always does so at weddings. Lily sees him and knowing that he laughs when she says the word, she blurts it out. The whole church starts laughing, so Lily keeps repeating it, causing Cam to rush her out of the church apologizing as the rest of the family and the other guests descend into hysterics. The episode ends with Jay putting a life vest on Stella so she can swim in the pool without drowning. Stella immediately goes to the filter of the pool and Manny (Rico Rodriguez) finds out that the reason she was jumping in the pool all along was to reach her stuck doggie toy. Jay finds it funny but Gloria does not. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Little Bo Bleep\\" was watched by 11.89 million; down 0.23 from the previous episode. =Reviews & Controversy= The episode was met with some controversy for the portrayal of a little girl swearing, although Aubrey Anderson-Emmons never actually said the word on camera. She was asked to say \\"fudge\\" during filming. Despite the negative reaction before the episode aired, the episode received positive reviews, with almost everyone saying that Lily's storyline is something that happened in almost all the families who have a toddler as a member and many of them agreed that the highlight of the episode was Claire's plot and the debate. Leigh Raines from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 5/5 and said that this episode made her see again why Modern Family is an award winning show. \\"Great post-GoldenGlobes episode for the Modern Family crew. For me it was chock full of amazing quotes, not including Lily's little slip up.\\" About the controversy she mentions: \\"Modern Family has always prided itself on being realistic and representing true-to-life situations. So why should it gloss over something as basic and common as the fact that little kids sometimes mimic bad words they hear their parents sa?. And just like Cam did, sometimes people laugh! If people are being that uptight one little curse word, sorry, but you're watching the wrong show.\\" Christine N. Ziemba of Paste Magazine gave the episode 8/10 stating that the episode wasn't \\"as awesome as it could be\\" and that \\"...an opportunity was missed by the writer Cindy Chupack (who also wrote the episode ‚ÄúExpress Christmas‚Äù) on a real story\\". On the controversy: \\"Modern Family is probably one of the least offensive shows on television right now. [...] Next time, if a toddler saying a faux f-word gets your panties in a bunch, we suggest the radical protest move of turning off the television.\\" Maris Kreizman of Vulture gave a good review to the episode stating that it was \\"one of the strongest of an uneven third season\\" and that there was not controversy on it, regarding Lily's storyline. Rachel Stein from Television Without Pitty named the episode one of the best yet with Lily's plotline to be the weakest one. Verne Gay of Newsday also gave a good review to the episode saying that it was \\"one of the funniest half hours of television all year\\". \\"\\"Little Bo Bleep\\" was a brilliant episode; nothing remotely offensive about it, and the message was pretty clear: Watch what you say around toddlers, and certainly don't laugh if they say something they shouldn't have said.\\" Adam Reisinger mentions on his blog that \\"Little Bo Bleep\\" is \\"one of the best and most true to life in terms of raising a toddler.\\" He closes his blog saying: \\"I'm sure even after seeing the episode, there will be some people who complain about a storyline that has a two-year- old uttering a profanity, but those are the kind of people who are just looking to stir up shit. In reality, Modern Family handled the storyline well, made it funny, and ended up with one of the best episodes of the season.\\" James Poniewozik talked about the controversy saying that it \\"will blow over quickly\\" and that the best part of the episode was Claire's plot. \\"...if not for the controversy, I probably would hardly have paid attention to this subplot. For my money the best part of the episode was Claire‚Äôs preparation and debate for the council election, which featured some fine physical comedy from Julie Bowen as Claire physically fought her instinct to roll her eyes and point her finger.\\" References External links  \\"Little Bo Bleep\\" at ABC.com Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Modern Family (season 3) episodes Category:Television episodes about weddings ","title":"Little Bo Bleep"},{"id":"34477472","text":"The 1996 United States presidential election in South Carolina took place on November 7, 1996, as part of the 1996 United States presidential election.

No Democrat has won the state since 1976, and today it is considered one of the safest red states. , this is the last election in which the following counties voted for a Democratic presidential candidate Chesterfield, Georgetown, Abbeville, Lancaster, and Union.Sullivan, Robert David; ‚ÄòHow the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century‚Äô; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Results { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" - style=\\"background-color:#E9E9E9\\" ! colspan=\\"7\\"  1996 United States presidential election in South Carolina -bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\" align=\\"center\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width: 13em\\" Party ! style=\\"width: 11em\\" Candidate ! style=\\"width: 10em\\" Running mate ! style=\\"width: 4em\\" Votes ! style=\\"width: 7em\\" Percentage ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Electoral votes - ! style=\\"background- color:#FF3333; width: 3px\\"   style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Republican  Bob Dole  Jack Kemp  align=\\"right\\"  573,458  align=\\"right\\"  49.89%  align=\\"right\\"  8 - ! style=\\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\\"   style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Democratic  Bill Clinton (incumbent)  Al Gore  align=\\"right\\"  504,051  align=\\"right\\"  43.85%  align=\\"right\\"  0 - ! style=\\"background- color:#6A287E; width: 3px\\"   style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Reform  Ross Perot  Patrick Choate  align=\\"right\\"  64,386  align=\\"right\\"  5.60%  align=\\"right\\"  0 - ! style=\\"background-color:#FFCC00; width: 3px\\"   style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Libertarian  Harry Browne  Jo Jorgensen  align=\\"right\\"  4,271  align=\\"right\\"  0.37%  align=\\"right\\"  0 - ! style=\\"background-color:#461B7E; width: 3px\\"   style=\\"width: 130px\\"  U.S. Taxpayers'  Howard Phillips  Herbert Titus  align=\\"right\\"  2,043  align=\\"right\\"  0.18%  align=\\"right\\"  0 - ! style=\\"background- color:#00BFFF; width: 3px\\"   style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Natural Law  Dr. John Hagelin  Dr. V.

It was purpose-built as a Deepwater Research Vessel for the then Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Research Centre at a cost of $27 million to replace the ageing GRV James Cook. It has a DNV classification of 1A1 (stern trawler) and Ice 1C (sufficient strength and power to operate in ice floes up to thick). It was transferred to the new National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in 1992. Tangaroa operates for 320 to 340 days per year conducting fisheries research in New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone and marine research in the waters surrounding Antarctica. It is equipped for hydrographic, bathymetric and oceanographic surveys to measure and map various properties of the ocean and seabed; biological surveys; and for both acoustic and trawl fisheries surveys. It can trawl to and conduct acoustic soundings down to . In 2010 Tangaroa received a $20 million upgrade including a dynamic positioning system. This allows the ship to \\"automatically maintain a vessel in a fixed position at sea (within a few metres) by using its own propellers and thrusters\\". NIWA defended contracting the work to a Singapore dockyard to do the work instead of using the Devonport Naval Base Dockyard. On one voyage in 2003, scientists aboard RV Tangaroa discovered over 500 species of fish and 1,300 species of invertebrate, and the tooth of an extinct Megalodon. Following the Nov 2016 Kaik≈çura earthquake, the ship was diverted to collect seafloor shallow cores between 14 and 19 Nov across and along the submarine Kaikoura Canyon. Andrew Leachman served as the ship's first captain for more than twenty years, bringing the ship to New Zealand from Norway, and taking it as far north as New Caledonia and as far south as Antarctica.

First published in Bengali in 1962, the novel became a bestseller and was translated into a number of Indian languages and made into a film and a play. It is considered arguably Sankar's most popular book, a classic novel in Bengali. The novel, translated into English by Arunava Sinha, won the Vodafone Crossword Book Award 2007 for the best translation. The novel was shortlisted for Independent Foreign Fiction Prize in 2010. Plot summary Sankar named his novel Chowringhee as the novel is set in Chowringhee, a neighborhood in Calcutta, in the mid-1950s. The narrator, Shankar, an ambitious young man who was previously a secretary of an English barrister becomes unemployed as the Barrister dies all of a sudden and he is forced to sell wastepaper baskets door to door. Once, as he takes rest in a neighborhood park, reminiscing about his past and fearful of what awaits him in future, Byron,a friend of his passes by and is shocked by Shankar's descent into poverty. He finds Shankar a job at the Shahjahan Hotel, one of the city's oldest and most venerable hotels. Shankar is soon befriended by Sata Bose, the hotel's chief receptionist, and after a brief stint as a typist, Shankar becomes Bose's main assistant and close confidant. The manager Marco Polo who is feared by all likes him as well, and the young Shankar is given more responsibilities. The story of the novel spins around the guests, entertainers, and frequent visitors of the Shahjahan, but several members of the hotel staff get equal importance in Shankar's narrative. We learn about the seamy underside of the elite of Calcutta, whose greed, shady deals, and shameful behaviors are initially shocking to our na√Øve young man, who soon becomes jaded and disgusted by them. The poverty of working and jobless Calcuttans is vividly portrayed, as those not in the upper echelon are only one stroke of bad luck away from living in the streets or in dilapidated hovels. Love is a central theme, amongst the guests and workers, with often tragic results.

It is native to northern North America, where it occurs throughout Alaska and northwestern Canada.Uchytil, Ronald J. 1991. Salix alaxensis. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. Description This plant is a shrub or tree up to tall. The stem diameter is up to . In harsher climates, it remains much smaller. The smooth, gray bark becomes furrowed and scaly with age. The leaves are up to 11 cm long and have woolly undersides.Salix alaxensis. Flora of North America. Reproduction The species is dioecious, with male and female reproductive parts on separate individuals. The inflorescence is a catkin up to 10 cm long. The fruit is a capsule. The seed has a downy layer of fibers that helps it disperse via wind and moving water. The seed remains viable for about a week, but it germinates within 24 hours of deposition upon a moist soil substrate. It does not germinate easily on dry soils or forest litter. The plant primarily reproduces sexually, via seed, but it can also reproduce vegetatively. It can resprout easily, and if stem fragments break off, they can often take root and grow into new plants. Ecology Moose are especially fond of this plant, pulling down and breaking branches up to 4 cm in diameter[Viereck, LA & EL Little (1972) Alaska Trees and Shrubs. USDA Forest Service Agricultural Handbook No. 410, Washington DC. p. 112] and eating up to 90% of the twigs on the plant. In some areas of northern Alaska, this plant provides 95% of the winter food for moose. Snowshoe hares also prefer it. In northern Alaska, this may be the only source of fuel wood. It is one of the tallest willows in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.Salix alaxensis. Aiken, S.G., et al. 2007.Salix alaxensis. Flora of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago: Descriptions, Illustrations, Identification, and Information Retrieval. NRC Research Press, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa. Distribution This willow is commonly dominant in willow communities across its range. Other willows in the habitat may include Bebb willow (S. bebbiana), grayleaf willow (S. glauca), Sitka willow (S. sitchensis), Pacific willow (S. lasiandra), barren-ground willow (S. brachycarpa), and halberd willow (S. hastata). It grows along rivers and streams and lakes. It grows in forested habitat, but it does not tolerate shade, so it persists only in open areas. Because it germinates quickly, it easily colonizes disturbed habitat, such as riverbanks scoured by recent floods and areas where glaciers have receded. It grows in early stages of succession, and after a few decades, it is shaded out by poplars and other trees as the habitat turns into forest. This plant is fire-adapted and can resprout after its aboveground parts are burned away. The wind-dispersed seeds then land on the burned soil and colonize the terrain. Uses and cultivation Native Americans used parts of willows, including this species, for medicinal purposes, basket weaving, to make bows and arrows, and for building animal traps. This plant is used for habitat restoration and revegetation of disturbed sites, such as pipelines. Cultivars have been developed, such as 'Rhode', which has been used for revegetation efforts. Cuttings and bundles of dormant branches can be directly planted in the ground and will take root.

The Pasig River is a river in the Philippines running right through the heart of Manila. It flows from Laguna de Bay to Manila Bay through a length of and an average of in width. The average depth of the river in around 4‚Äì6 m. The river runs through some of the most populated areas in the Philippines. Throughout history, the river was used as a major source of transportation, water, food and livelihood for many Manila residents. The river was such an important part of the country that many houses were built alongside its shores. Malaca√±an Palace, the official residence of the President of the Philippines, is located alongside the river. In October 2018, the PRRC won the first Asia Riverprize, in recognition of its efforts to rehabilitate the Pasig River. According to the PRRC, aquatic life has returned to river.  Pollution timeline Pollution in Manila Bay. Manila Bay is the catchment area of the Pasig and Pampanga River Basins. After World War II, the rich began to move away from the shores of the Pasig and many factories took their place. During this time, shanty towns filled with squatters were created wherever there was room, including on stilts over the river. This caused the lifeline of many Filipinos to be suffocated. Through the years, the problem got progressively worse. It got to the point, in recent years, where mounds of garbage float down the river alongside boats and many of the tributaries became filled with garbage until there was no water left. * 1930s: Fish migration from Laguna Lake slowed * 1950s: Bathing activities declined * 1960s: Washing of clothing was forced to stop and ferry service declined * 1970s: The river began to give off a smell * 1980s: All fishing activities were forced to stop * 1990s: The river was declared biologically dead = Shanty towns = Many of the people who moved into these post-WWII shanty towns were from the different provinces. These people come to Manila to find better jobs and lives. They did not have money and were forced into shanty towns. These makeshift towns and villages do not have basic infrastructure and utilities, like sewage facilities, garbage collection, and running water. This is one of the main reasons that the shanty towns were built along the shores of the Pasig. The people would not need to go far to get fresh water, they could simply put their sewage and garbage in the river as the river would carry it away. They could catch their food and bath in the Pasig. The river became the lifeline for many shanty towns, and it is these villages that were suffocating the river and, in turn, destroying their own livelihoods. Living in the shanty towns can be a precarious proposition as many were built on stilts above the river, which is prone to flooding during the rainy seasons. Poor construction causes many of the settlements to be extremely weak against the elements. They can be very dangerous during fires as most of them are built from recycled wood. Many non-governmental organizations are working with the urban poor to ensure that they receive the help and proper treatment from the government during the rehabilitation of the Pasig. They are fighting to halt all evictions that are beyond the 3m easement that is created by law along the shores of the river and tributaries. They are also trying to upgrade the urban poor areas and create sustainable living. After the Barangay Pineda incident, NGOs are attempting to create a coalition of the poor people living on the shores of the Pasig to stop the government from illegal relocation or relocation into areas where the poor will not be better off. The three main NGOs are Urban Poor Associates, CO Multiversity, and the community organization Philippines Enterprise.  Rehabilitation and relocation efforts  Residents of Freedom Island help Greenpeace and other NGO's in the coastal clean-up in 2017. Rehabilitation efforts began in 2010 with the help of the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA). The Asian Development Bank gave the government of the Philippines a loan of $200 million to implement a 15-year slum upgrade program for Metro Manila which includes the rehabilitation of the Pasig River. This loan is under the conditions that the relocation and livelihoods of the illegal squatters have equal importance as the environmental aspect of the rehabilitation. The overall objective of the rehabilitation is to improve environmental management particularly with waste-water management and urban renewal. There are even talks about using Laguna de Bay for drinking water to supply the growing population of Metro Manila, on the condition that the river and surrounding waterways are cleaned and kept clean. Plans are being implemented for a dike to be built at the entrance to the Pasig River at Laguna de Bay to keep flood waters out during rainy season to prevent major areas of the city from flooding; this is coming under great controversy as the people living around Laguna de Bay would have to deal with flooding. Because the majority of the people living on the edges of the river are illegal squatters, it is very difficult to monitor the amount of garbage or waste -- or to treat either of them. It is estimated that 65% of the waste flowing down the Pasig River is due to these illegal settlement villages. Philippine law states that the government has the legal right to relocate the people in these illegal settlements to 3 m away from the shore of the river. This is under controversy as the government wants people to be 10 m away from the river's edge to ensure that the river stays clean, to add a buffer zone against potential flooding, to create parks and walkways, and to allow access for ships and emergency services. This was officially changed during the Joseph Estrada administration when the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) changed the law from 3 m to 10 m. This is controversial as the MMDA does not have the authority to change a national law. During the administration of Fidel V. Ramos, approximately 5000 families were relocated to the suburbs. There are approximately 700,000‚Äì750,000 people are being affected by the relocation of illegal settlements along the Pasig River. This includes people who are being relocated away from the shores of Laguna de Bay, the Pasig River, and all of its tributaries. Around 10,000 illegal settlers will be relocated to Calauan, which is on the southern shore of Laguna de Bay. They will be moved into an environmentally friendly housing project. Many others are being relocated to Bulacan, Rodriguez, and Cavite. The main problem that the government is facing with the relocation is that many of the relocated people move back to Manila into a different shanty town due to the fact that they work in Manila and it is hard to find work in many other places on Luzon. Former Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay stated ‚ÄúAside from livelihood, there should be transportation assistance‚Äù. He is referring to having some sort of assisted transportation for these urban poor so that they can live in the suburbs and work every day in Manila. The illegal squatters who relocated received financial assistance of P24,240. Those who have opted to be relocated or who have simply been forced to relocate by the government have been relocated to: # Kasiglahan Village I: Rodriguez, Rizal # Kasiglahan Village II: c5, Taguig City # Kasiglahan Village III: Trece Martires, Cavite # Kasiglahan Village IV & V: General Trias, Cavite # Villa San Isidro: Rodriguez, Rizal # Jaime Cardinal Sin Village: Sta. Ana, Manila = Barangay Pineda = One of the areas that the government has been receiving the most trouble is in Barangay Pineda. In September 2000, the government came in to relocate all of the illegal settlers but the settlers fought back stabbing and killing one of the demolition workers. After this event, no more families were to be relocated as the Asian Development Bank threatened to refuse their loans to the government if relocation efforts did not improve, including the people who were already moved. The people in Barangay Pineda were awarded the right to purchase the land they were on at a subsidized rate and the government implemented sewage facilities, better drainage, and roads to ensure that the river stayed clean. Due to the success at Barangay Pineda, many other communities of illegal settlers are now fighting for the same rights that were awarded to Barangay Pineda. This can be seen in places such as Baseco, where the same rights were given and better services were implemented.  Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission  The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission was created in 1999 under Executive Order No. 54. Its purpose is to rehabilitate the Pasig River to its previous pristine condition, for recreation, transportation, and tourism. The PRRC is in charge of overseeing all rehabilitative actions on the Pasig River. It manages the \\"river warriors\\" that patrol for polluters and squatters, clean the Pasig River and connecting esteros, add new plants along the river banks, ensure that the 10 m environmentally preservation areas are created, floating barriers are installed to ensure garbage is not sent down the river, monitor the water quality in the river and esteros to ensure that the water is Class \\"C\\", etc. Class \\"C\\" refers to water that can sustain the propagation and growth of fish and other aquatic life, water then can be used for recreational purposes including boating, and industrial water that can be used for industrial purposes after treatment. * Mission: To transform the Pasig River and its environs into a showcase of new quality of urban life * Vision: A new Pasig River -- clean and alive -- reflecting the country's noble history and progress * Goal: Restore river water quality to Class \\"C\\" level  Estero de Paco  During its early years the Paco Market, which sits along the edge of the Estero de Paco, was a bustling center of commerce and culture. Local fisherman were able to take their day's catch directly from the ocean down the Pasig River to Estero de Paco, which is one of its largest tributaries. This provided the ability for many locals to gain their livelihoods from the clean waters of the Estero de Paco and Pasig River. After WWII, when the Pasig River began to become polluted, the Estero de Paco was not able to escape the pollution. The Paco Market was neglected for years and was eventually overrun by thieves, drugs, and filth. The market vendors neglected the Estero de Paco and threw all their garbage and waste into it. As happened with the Pasig River and the rest of its tributaries, squatters moved to the sides of the Estero de Paco, further deteriorating the water quality. Over a 10-month period, the Paco market and Estero de Paco have been revived into a cleaner, more organized market and a clean tributary flowing into the Pasig. The garbage and also silt from sewage sludge in the estero was removed by the River Warriors and through dredging. The River Warriors clean the estero with small nets and ensure that no more garbage is being placed there. All squatters along the shores of the tributary were relocated to Laguna, Philippines. They were given affordable housing options and livelihood training for their move. The shore of the estero now have vetiver grass growing to prevent erosion. Coco Coir has been mixed with a helpful bacteria to decompose garbage left in the estero and to treat the waste water and sludge. Air is being pumped in so that the water can sustain life and fish can be placed back in the estero. The Paco market has now been refurbished to be environmentally sustainable. A center was created inside the market to provide education to the locals about the rehabilitation efforts. The market has natural lighting and no air-conditioning to conserve energy. All vendors are charged rent to ensure that the market is able to sustain itself but not enough to cause a burden. The market sells products produced by the relocated squatters providing a source of income for those people.  Pasig River Ferry Service  Riding inside the ferry. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission was placed in charge of this attempt at implementing a ferry service down the Pasig River in 2007. Before the Pasig became as polluted as it is, ferries were commonplace on the river. The last two attempts to bring in a ferry service were cut short due to too much garbage, shanty towns, and foul odors. With the river being dredged, shanty towns being relocated away from the river, and other environmentally sustainable initiatives, these are now less of a problem. Ferry service was brought back into the Pasig River in 2007 under the management of the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission. It was to be operated by SCC Nautical Transport Services Inc. Six boats with capacity for 150 people, air conditioning, televisions, security, and washrooms were put into service. It was the longest-lasting ferry service down the Pasig in recent years and had the longest route, with 14 stations lining the major hubs on the river. With fares ranging from P25 to P60 per trip and travel times cut in half for many, the ferry allowed many people to skip the congested streets of Manila. With less garbage, less foul odors, fewer shanty towns, and more environmental initiatives being implemented, river tours were being conducted by SCC Nautical Transport Services Inc. It was not all smooth sailing for the latest attempt to implement a ferry service down the Pasig. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission oversaw all operations and built the ferry terminals, while SCC Nautical Transport Services Inc operated the ferry and four of the terminals in Quiapo, Kalawaan, Bambang, and Nagpayong. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission received none of the profits from these stations. Since these were the first four stations, the ferries were generally full by the time they arrived at the other terminals. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission only received only P5 of every ticket sold, leading them to loss P94.07 million (expenses: P101.4 million; revenue: P7.33 million). Another problem that occurred was that SCC Nautical Transport Services Inc was supposed to implement 18 50-seat vessels and not 6 150-seat vessels. It was due to this that some of the stations could not be used because the boats were too large to navigate. With river tours being operated, many scheduled trips had to be cancelled to accommodate them, causing many frustrated passengers to stop taking the ferry and causing passenger numbers to dwindle. Before this, the numbers were high enough that all ferries were full and SCC Nautical Transport Services Inc was considering purchasing more. The ferry service ceased operations in 2011.  Environmental Preservation Areas  Environmental Preservation Areas (EPAs) are being placed along the shores of the Pasig and all of its tributaries, stretching 10m from the shores on each side. They will have no businesses, homes, or illegal settlements. This 10m safety net will cause waste water, sewage, and garbage from illegal settlers to be kept away from the river. During emergencies, the river will provide access for maintenance and emergency crews and will provide a buffer zone during times of flooding. These areas will also allow river transportation as well as boats bringing amenities to the city, including the local markets. They will serve as tourist attractions, greenbelts, and riverside parks. The 10m distance from the shore has come under controversy since its implementation. The official law states that the government can relocate people who are within 3 m of the shores, but the Metro Manila Development Authority extended this to 10 m. This is greatly contested as they do not have authority to change a national law. Families that were past the 3 m point were still being relocated to make way for the EPA zones.

It the umbrella organisation for over 200 Jewish organisations across AustraliaAs Anti-Semitism Rises, ‚ÄòI Don‚Äôt Feel Safe in Australia,‚Äô Rabbi Says which are ECAJ's constituent or affiliate organisations, or are affiliated to those organisations. These include: (i) the seven roof bodies of the Jewish community in each State and the ACT, which are the ECAJ's Constituent organisations; (ii) approximately 175 Jewish organisations which are constituents or affiliates of the State and ACT roof bodies; (iii) nine other national Jewish organisations which operate in at least 3 States and are the ECAJ's Affiliate organisations; and (iv) the independent branch organisations of the ECAJ's Affiliates. ECAJ is an elected body, but not by rank and file members of the Jewish community. Of the ECAJ's 33 Councillors, 25 are directly elected by the members of its constituent organisations, and 8 are appointed by its affiliate organisations. The ECAJ is the Australian affiliate of the World Jewish Congress, the worldwide umbrella organization of Jewish communities. It is also affiliated with the Commonwealth Jewish Council, the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress, the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, and the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture.  Overview  ECAJ was created in 1944 as the peak body for the various state based representative bodies. Syd Einfeld was President of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry between 1953‚Äì54, 1957‚Äì58, and 1961‚Äì62.  Platform and advocacy  The ECAJ Policy Platform covers a broad range of issues, including human rights, indigenous issues, multiculturalism, interfaith relations, refugees, education, Holocaust remembrance, racial vilification, antisemitism, religious issues, and Israel and the international community. The ECAJ website includes a pictorial history of Australia and Israel including government-to-government, commercial, cultural and people-to- people relationships between the two countries from the earliest years onward. There have been criticisms of the organisation that they are not truly representative and that their elections are to narrow to a claim to represent all of Australia's Jews. = Communal submissions = One of the roles of ECAJ is to prepare submissions to the government on behalf of the Jewish community. This has been on a broad range of topics such as the statutory definition of charity, human rights, freedom of religion and labeling kosher foods. ECAJ has also taken a stand against child sexual abuse which had a significant presence in the community. ECAJ advocated for the return of Malka Leifer from Israel to face abuse allegations, and issued an apology to abuse advocate, Manny Waks, who was abused as a child. In 2019, ECAJ called on the government to offer more protections to faith-based hospitals, aged care facilities and housing providers, to allow organisations to continue to preference people of their own faith in service delivery. ECAJ head Peter Wertheim provided the example that a Jewish facility should have the right to reject people of other faiths when selecting board members. = Anti-Semitism = One of the roles of ECAJ is to monitor antisemitic instances in Australia. This includes the unprecedented 60% jump in incidents for 2018 on the back of an increase in 2017. This was seen mostly due to a sharp increase in white supremacist activity. Another significant rise was recorded in 2019. They also strongly objected to the extremist politicians, Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts coming to speak in the Jewish suburbs of Melbourne. They were invited by a Jewish extremist Avi Yemini, and many white nationalists were expected at the event, before it was cancelled. ECAJ in their statement with the Jewish Community Council of Victoria said that while they \\"generally support the right of people to express their opinions\\", they objected to this event going ahead. = Israel advocacy = ECAJ, while officially a peak body for Australian Jewry, regularly conducts advocacy on behalf of Israel. One significant area of pro-Israel advocacy is in their opposition to the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel. ECAJ has rejected the BDS movement as anti-Semitic, although they did not join the legal proceedings against a Sydney professor brought by the group Shurat HaDin. ECAJ submitted a complaint to Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) over their screening the TV series The Promise in November and December 2011. This complaint pointed to many examples of the negative stereotyping of the Jewish people throughout the series, in particular through the portrayals of the Jewish characters. This was later supported by the Chairman of the New South Wales Community Relations Commission, Stepan Kerkyasharian. His submission argued that the program was guilty of \\"the portrayal of an entire nation in a negative light\\" and noted \\"concern that the series negatively portrays the WHOLE of the Jewish People. Such a portrayal cannot be justified in ANY context.\\" In 2019 ECAJ also released a rebuttal against the Israeli journalist and political candidate, Orly Noy who claimed anti-Sephardi racism and Apartheid was deeply rooted in Israeli society.

It is the largest park in the city. It is one of four major parks in Haikou and can be compared to Baishamen Park in that both have large, open, grass areas. The other two, Golden Bull Mountain Ridge Park and Haikou People's Park, have a relatively high percentage of tree cover. Many of the city's festivals and events are held in Evergreen Park. History Evergreen Park was opened on January 3, 1996. A view of the lake looking north during renovations Around 2017 to 2018, the park was renovated. This involved landscaping, work on the plants, improving lakeside areas and drainage, the installation of footbridges and paved gathering areas, as well as an upgrade to the lighting within the park. Most of the main, east-west road, L«úyuan Middle Road, was removed. The total area affected was 19,000 sq. metres. With most of the renovations complete in the main part of the park by mid-2018, work began on the northwest part to bring it into use. Before then, it was mostly unmaintained and was used for maintenance workers to grow plants for the rest of the park. Location Evergreen Park is situated on the north shore of Haikou city facing Haikou Bay. The Haikou Great Hall of the People (a concert hall) and the former Hainan Exhibition & Convention Center (now being converted to a mall) are adjacent to the west side of the park. The mouth of the Haidian River and the Haikou Century Bridge are located by the eastern side. Haikou City Stadium is located on Binhai Road, at the southeastern corner of the park. Description The main entrance to the park is on Bin Hai Road at the east end of the park. There, a city bus terminal is also located within the park to provide access. Evergreen Park consists of largely of open grassy areas with approximately ten thousand coconut trees and hundreds of species of South Asian ornamental plants. There are numerous features, including a children's area, food streets, small amusement park, and an artificial lake. The artificial lake connects to Haikou Bay via a small river with two footbridges. The amusement park, food streets, and various kiosks are located at the southeast corner. The west end contains parking facilities and some small, outdoor restaurants.

The facility is slated to be built between the 600 blocks of East Monument and East Madison Streets. The jail is designed to house between 180 and 230 youth facing trial as an adult. These youth were previously incarcerated along with adults in the Baltimore City Detention Center (BCDC) but are now detained at The Baltimore City Juvenile Justice Center (BCJJC) in a separate unit. Youth charged as adults are not covered by the provisions for \\"Sight and Sound Separation\\" required by the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. Background The state of Maryland announced plans to build new facilities for children and women in 2007, amidst investigations by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) calling BCDC \\"deliberately indifferent\\" to the condition of inmates. These plans were tentative; the DOJ demanded maintenance for existing facilities, but not the creation of new ones. One of the biggest concerns, then and now, is the inadequacy of available health care. On January 18, 2008, Governor Martin O'Malley announced plan to spend $200 million constructing new juvenile detention facilities, including one in Baltimore. Advocates of the new prison suggest that BCDC is unsafe and unhealthy for juveniles, and that the detained youth need their own building. They additionally suggest that a special youth facility would be able to focus more on rehabilitation. The average number of juveniles housed in BCDC at any given time has declined from 92 to 47 since 2007 (a peak year). Project In 2009, Maryland DPSCS selected Dewberry, a preeminent corrections architecture firm, to design the facility. The projected cost of construction was $99.7 million, 9.6% of which goes into design. $14 million had been spent on the project by May 2011. Plans for the jail called for 180 beds in single-occupancy rooms. Some rooms will be divisible, making room for a total of 230 children. The building would have had a total of 229,348 square feet of floor, with 147,294 net usable square feet. Population size for the detention center is based on a projected total of 180 prisoners in the year 2025. Plans call for six large housing segments, each of which includes activity spaces, a counseling room, and a space for police officers. The building will also have a gym, a community space, and a separate intake center. Dewberry also plans to seek LEED certification. PSA-Dewberry, which also has a contract to build a jail for women nearby, intends for various core services to be shared among the two buildings. Criticism A white paper released by the National Council on Crime and Delinquency contests the need for additional bed space. It cites both a decreasing youth population (‚àí17% since 2000) and decreasing crime rates (‚àí33% since 2000) as reasons to expect less crime from Baltimore's youth. The report also notes the existence of \\"reverse waivers\\", which allow adult courts to transfer youth to the juvenile detention system while retaining control of their case. An alliance of community groups, education advocates, and others released a memo to state and municipal politicians, as well as to members of the public, stating several points of opposition to the plan. The memo recommends avoiding the practice of trying youth as adults entirely. It also suggests reallocating the money for the jail to schools and community recreation centers. Jabriera Handy, for the Just Kids Partnership to End the Automatic Prosecution of Youth as Adults , editorialized in the Baltimore Sun that ending the practice of trying youth as adults would be preferable to the construction of a new jail. As a person tried as an adult when she was 17, Handy also cautions readers that youth ought not to be housed at the Baltimore City Detention Center; she suggests that perhaps a temporary facility could be found. Pastor Heber Brown argued that the state's spending priorities reflected basic racism against Baltimore's African American residents. Protests The new jail has been the target of ongoing demonstrations, many on the vacant lot slated for development. Groups protesting the jail include the Baltimore Algebra Project, Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, Pleasant Hope Baptist Church, Kinetics Faith and Justice Network, Occupy Baltimore, the Safe and Sound Campaign, Critical Resistance and more. =Baltimore Algebra Project= The Baltimore Algebra Project has advocated for budget reform since 2004. In 2009 and 2010, after seeing two of its own members tried as adults, the group began to focus on specifically opposing the school-to-prison pipeline. It formed a large coalition to oppose the construction of the youth jail, which it argued would actually lead to more young people being tried as adults and imprisoned. =Schools not Jails= On January 16, 2012 opponents of the jail, including members of the recently evicted Occupy Baltimore protest, held a demonstration they called \\"Schools not Jails.\\" Members of the group entered the site of the proposed jail and erected a schoolhouse, from which they taught a lesson on Frederick Douglass. State police arrested six protestors and dismantled the building. While State Troopers arrested the protesters, city police kept away representatives from the media. Fern Shen reported for Baltimore Brew: :After the tent was gone, Det. Brown, of the Baltimore City Police, came over and yelled at me to leave: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre supposed to be with the other media outside the perimeter.‚Äù Asked why the press had to leave, Brown, said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to tell you that, I just have to escort you over there.‚Äù He warned that I‚Äôd be subject to the same treatment ‚Äúthey‚Äù were, indicating the protesters but declining to say what that treatment was. Schools not Jails continued to host events throughout the week. Participants heard from different groups, including Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, Civilian-Soldier Alliance, and Critical Resistance. A large police presence remained at the site all week. Re-evaluation The 2011 NCCD paper brought calls to decrease the size of the planned jail, including a Baltimore Sun editorial. The Maryland General Assembly asked the DPSCS to produce a report on whether the number of beds at the facility could be reduced, suspending work on the project in the meantime. In December 2011, DPSCS accepted the NCCD recommendation and recommended that construction proceed for a 120-bed facility. DCPSS reconfirmed this plan in March 2012 and agreed to a $16.9 million cut in the prison's funding. In April 2012, the Maryland House Appropriations Committee again declared the project suspended and asked DPSCS to provide another report: on whether the existing Pre-Release Unit for Women could be used as an alternative space to hold youth charged as adults.

Latinos were the United States' fastest growing population according to the 2010 census, which has prompted media companies to increase their presence in Spanish-language television. In addition, Univision hopes to benefit from increased demand for Spanish-language news programs.

Built in 1938, the Rio served East Vancouver primarily as a movie theatre until 2008, when new owners began to add live music and multimedia and multidisciplinary art events. The Rio seats 420 people, including a balcony section. The projection room houses both a vintage 35-millimetre projector and a 3D digital projector added in 2010. The venue includes a lobby with concession voted best in 2010 and 2011 for single screen theatres in Vancouver, a large stage, and a backstage greenroom for live performers. Since its evolution in 2008, the Rio has hosted Hollywood blockbusters, local independent filmmakers, midnight screenings of cult classics, the toddler-friendly \\"Movies for Mommies\\" series, local and international film festivals, comedy festivals, queer film events, burlesque shows, screenings and tours for local public schools, political events, religious services, spoken word and other live performances, and local and international live music. Dispute with British Columbia Liquor Control and Licensing Branch According to owner Corinne Lea, the Rio was at risk of business failure under a movies-only model, as indicated by the failure of all but two single-screen theatres in Vancouver by the end of 2011.https://vancouversun.com/business/Curtains+fall+last+time+Oakridge+Cinemas/5935777/story.html In 2010, Lea applied for a primary liquor license from the British Columbia Liquor Control and Licensing Branch, in order to attract more live music events where alcohol could be served. When the license was presented to Ms. Lea on January 18, 2012, the LCLB had inserted a condition, unique among any primary liquor license holder in the province, that \\"This establishment is not permitted to show movies or any type of cinematic screenings at any time,\\" effectively banning The Rio from screening films at any point in the future, regardless of whether alcohol is being served. Lea has said she felt she had no choice but to sign the license or the Rio would need to shut its doors. Response to the LCLB decision has ranged from a Facebook-centred community political action campaign, targeting the LCLB and provincial MLAs to intervene, to national media attention. Proponents involved in assisting the Rio Theatre in the short term, who are also calling on the province of British Columbia to amend its antiquated liquor laws in the long term, include BC MLA Spencer Chandra Herbert, City of Vancouver Councillor Heather Deal, and Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson, among others. There are no known opponents to the newly licensed Rio Theatre also continuing to show unlicensed general- admission movies. In response, the LCLB claimed that it was not able to alter its procedures due to the Regulations of the BC Liquor Control and Licensing Act. The LCLB also stated that it was acting in the interests of \\"public safety\\" to prevent the possibility of minors consuming alcohol \\"in the dark,\\" despite the fact that the Rio had agreed to not sell alcohol during general admission film screenings. ON February 9, 2012, the B.C. Government announced that they were making changes to the province's liquor licensing rules to allow venues that serve alcohol to also screen movies, albeit at different times. However, this was not the win they were fighting for, Corinne Lea did not accept these limited restrictions placed on her business. She kept on with her campaign to change the BC liquor laws so that alcohol could be served during movies and live events. The battle took four months in total, while The Rio Theatre struggled to survive, going severely in debt during this time. In April 2012 the BC Liquor laws were finally changed to allow all movie theatres with a Primary liquor license in BC to serve alcohol during film screenings. Later in January 2013 Corinne Lea was awarded a Diamond Jubilee Governor General award for her successful battle to change the liquor laws.

John Rosbrugh took his place at the head of the company and slinging his musket over his shoulder led the company to join General Washington and the Continental Army in Philadelphia.

John Witherspoon, whom British troops had recently burned in effigy. See: William M. Dwyer, The Day is Ours!

His executioners took his watch, money and left his body naked in the snow. Captain Hays, on hearing of the death of his pastor wrapped the body and quickly buried him where he fell. The next morning Rev. George Duffield, a brother Presbyterian chaplain took the body of his friend and reburied him in the graveyard of the First Presbyterian Church of Trenton. It is believed he still rests there today with his grave marked by a stone shaped as a clock. His widow, Jane (n√©e Ralston) survived him by 32 years, passing away on 27 March 1809.

Rustine's solution was a small disc of thin rubber to stick to the inner tube over the hole. He patented his invention in 1921 and presented it at a meeting of the Touring Club de France in 1922. Puncture patches are still commonly known in France as rustines. History Louis Rustin was born in Paris, France, on February 29, 1880, the son of a hotel manager and, his mother, a cook.http://www.janinetissot.fdaf.org/jt_rustin.htm His birth came after the growth of the bicycle industry and the first flourishing of the automobile industry. Cars and bicycles used pneumatic tires and could be brought to a halt when a sharp object, common on roads of the period, penetrated the outer tyre and deflated the rubber chamber within it that held the air. Rustin went into business in the rue Truffaut in the 17th arrondissement of Paris in 1903 to repair and replace the tread of tyres.http://www.rustin.com/histo.php?cat=3‚â∂=1 He also competed in cycling races. Bicycle tyres, and in particular those used in competitions, were fragile and vulnerable to punctures. Rustin and other racers were occasionally brought to a halt, forced to repair their machines by the roadside. The cycling historian Raymond Henry says repairs before Rustin's invention were made by cutting a patch from a discarded air tube, scraping it with a file, then cleaning it with petrol. The repair patch and punctured tube were then coated with rubber solution and each heated above a flame until the rubber had reached the correct temperature and softness. The patch was then pressed on to the air tube and held until the rubber had cooled enough to make the attachment permanent. Rustin developed his ideas from 1908 with his colleague, Jean Larroque, registering a first patent, number 397 424, on December 15, 1908. Research ended with the start of World War I in 1914. Rustin fought in the army, then returned to the tyre industry after demobilisation, opening a workshop at 16 rue du Bois in Clichy (now the rue Henri Barbusse). It was there that he made the first modern puncture patch, a thin circular patch of flexible rubber that was already coated with a gum that did not need to be heated. He patented his invention, offering ‚Äú instant repair of inner tubes without solutions, without petrol, without anything ‚ÄùLabel on Rustin‚Äôs first repair kits: R√©paration instantan√©e des chambres √† air par les Rustines √† tirette, peuvent se poser sans dissolution, sans essence, sans rien The patent covered the patch, the dry fixative attached to it, and the protective bands which kept the patch clean until they were removed just before the repair. The formula for the fixing coat was devised by a chemist, Paul Doumenjou, who also helped create early non-inflammable film for the cinema industry.http://www.landrucimetieres.fr/spip/spip.php?article1839 =Marketing= Rustin bought tickets for the six-day race at the V√©lodrome d'Hiver in Paris and gave them to young cyclists in the city. They sat on opposite sides of the track. One side shouted \\"Hisssssss...!\\" when a rider punctured, those on the other responded with \\"Rustine, Rustine, Rustine...\\" Rustine later sponsored competitions during the Tour de France and in other races such as Bordeaux-Paris introduced a Kilom√®tre Rustine challenge on the track, and sponsored riders such as Andr√© Leducq. Rustin presented his invention to a rally of the Touring Club de France at Fontainebleau in June 1922. A jury including Gaston Cl√©ment, who the following year established the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise des Soci√©t√©s de Cyclotourisme, awarded him its grande m√©daille. Expansion Rustin's business employed 90 people at Clichy, where he had three workshops.http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/16/89/53/PDF/Jonathan- Truillet_archeologie-industrielle-en-France.pdf It was making 28 million puncture patches a month by 1933. It moved to a larger factory in the Loir valley between Tours and Le Mans. Work stopped during the German occupation of France between 1940 and 1944. Work restarted and production increased rapidly from 1947, the company employing up to 250 people. Rustin expanded into other areas of the rubber industry in the 1950s and still makes puncture patches today.

In 560 BC King Croesus of Lydia incurs the wrath of the sorceress Queen Attossa he had promised to marry, when he chooses the beautiful Delarai of Persia instead. Attossa, in disembodied form, mocks Croesus nearly to the point of madness, so he seeks a solution from the fortune-teller Aesop, who is very young and handsome, but believes that people only receive wisdom with age, arrived from the Isle of Samos in disguise of an old man with a hunch, a limp, and a cane. But Aesop also has eyes for Delarai. This expensive, lavish Technicolor production of plaster Grecian temples and painted skies was Wanger's second attempt to film the novel, and ended up costing $1.6 million and losing Universal some $800,000. One source describes it as a kitschy \\"Maria Montez vehicle without Maria Montez\\".Universal horrors: the studio's classic films, 1931‚Äì1946, by Tom Weaver, Michael Brunas, John Brunas, page 532 (The correct title is Night in Paradise, not \\"A Night in Paradise\\" as some sources have it.) Plot In 560 BC King Croesus of Lydia incurs the wrath of the sorceress Queen Attossa he had promised to marry, when he chooses the beautiful Delarai of Persia instead. Attossa, in disembodied form, mocks Croesus nearly to the point of madness, so he seeks a solution from the fortune-teller Aesop, who is very young and handsome, but believes that people only receive wisdom with age, arrived from the Isle of Samos in disguise of an old man with a hunch, a limp, and a cane. But Aesop also has eyes for Delarai. One day, Delarai invites Aesop to interpret a charm. As he does, he goes as his young self but with a different name, Jason. Delarai doesn't know at first, but as she sees the same scar on Jason's hand as Aesop's hand, she knows, and reveals that a hunch and a limp may be faked, but a scar remains a scar, and they fall in love with each other, but Atossa and the people in the palace suspect something is going on with Aesop and Delarai. Croesus wanted the Oracle to tell him the truth and sends Aesop to retrieve it. As Aesop is packing, Delarai talks him out of it but fails. Aesop goes anyway, and Delarai cries herself to sleep. Aesop does go fetch it from a priest, but the priest refuses, saying his life is valuable. Aesop claims that if a priest's words do not mean anything, then his life means less and strangles him. He takes the priest's clothes and hides his face in the hood. Delarai comes to the temple, wanting to seek for Aesop, but before she could say anything, Aesop reveals his young face slightly, and Delarai breaks out a smile. As the security guards see her smile, they unmask Aesop, and Aesop and Delarai run hand in hand. They are forced to jump off a cliff. They jump in each other arms, and Attosa reveals her image at sea, saying that Aesop and Delarai actually survived because of their faith, their love, and a little help from Attosa. They live in a small cottage with a lake and a garden. Delarai is mending and Aesop's hand around on her shoulder, 12 boys come out saying \\"daddy!\\" which reveals that they got married and have children. \\"Another fable to bed?\\" asks the eldest son.

In 1934 Hellman announced he had dramatised his own novel. The same year Walter Wanger announced he would make a film based on the novel as the third movie for his newly formed Walter Wanger Productions, after The President Vanishes and Private Worlds. It was to star Ann Harding. However the film was not made. The project was reactivated in 1944 with Universal agreeing to make it with Wagner. The stars were to be Turhan Bey and Louise Abritten with Arthur Lubin to direct. In December 1944 Hedda Hopper reported that the film would star Maria Montez and that Wagner wanted Claude Rains for a key role. However, by January 1945 Merle Oberon had the lead. Reception =Critical= Diabolique magazine later wrote \\"This is painful to watch, one of Lubin's worst movies; those Maria Montez-Jon Hall films were full of movement and pace but Paradise is basically a lot of hanging around a palace, relying on its two leads to provide star power they simply didn‚Äôt have.

In 2018-19, it also became the Spanish rightsholder of the UEFA Champions League. The channel has ties with the Mexican sports channel of the same name, sharing some of its programming. Before July 20, 2019, when the Mexican counterpart was known as Televisa Deportes Network (TDN), the channel was referred to as Univision TDN during these programs. In 2019, it was announced that TDN and UDN would jointly relaunch as TUDN‚Äîsignifying a greater amount of collaboration between the two channels. As of February 2015, approximately 39.7 million households (34.1% of those with television) receive the channel. Univision stated per Nielsen ratings that TUDN was the sixth-highest rated U.S. sports channel in 2019 in terms of average primetime viewership. History In May 2011, Univision Communications announced three new cable television channels to strengthen its position in the Latino market and diversify revenues, including one dedicated to Soccer and other sports. It signed a deal with the Dish Network in January 2012 to carry the channels via satellite. The channel dedicated to sports was named Univision Deportes Network. On May 11, 2012, AT&T; U-verse signed a carriage agreement with Univision Communications to carry the channel, along with Univision Tlnovelas.Univision signs deal to launch cable networks on AT&T; U-verse, Media Moves, May 11, 2012 At launch, it offered a secondary network known as Univision Deportes Network Dos airing repeats of matches and studio programming, which was exclusively carried by Dish, but is currently defunct. In May 2019, it was announced that both Univision Deportes Network and Televisa Deportes Network would be jointly rebranded as TUDN. The new branding is a combination of abbreviations TDN and UDN, but the first two letters are also pronounced as the Spanish adjective \\"tu\\" (your), allowing the name to also be read as \\"Tu deportes network\\" (\\"Your sports network\\"). TUDN will be promoted as a multi-platform brand, and there will be closer collaboration between the American and Mexican channels‚Äîallowing for expanded studio programming in the morning and daytime hours (to bolster its expansion into European soccer with its recent acquisition of UEFA rights, and existing content such as Liga MX soccer). Univision Deportes Network officially rebranded as TUDN on July 20, 2019. Programming The network's signature program is Univision Deportes F√∫tbol Club, an hour-long sports update show hosted by Xavi Sol (as of late 2017) alongside F√©lix Fern√°ndez and Hristo Stoichkov. There was a late-night version of the program hosted by Alejandro Berry with various rotating analysts. The two editions of F√∫tbol Club differed by tone and style, with the early evening version being more lighthearted and comedic, while the late night version consisted of a round table discussion regarding the day's action (similar in format to ESPN's Around the Horn). The latter version was later renamed \\"Linea de Cuatro\\". TUDN broadcasts home games for 16 of 18 teams in the Liga MX, away matches for the rest of the teams and playoff games. The weekly Saturday night program ‚Äì F√∫tbol Central hosted by Edgar Martinez ‚Äì features football highlights and previews matches from the Mexican league. Other competitions covered include the CONCACAF Champions League and Major League Soccer. Rights to MLS games in 2012 are shared with sister networks Galavision and UniM√°s. In January 2016, Univision acquired Spanish-language rights to UEFA tournaments beginning in 2018, including UEFA Euro 2020 and the UEFA Nations League, with the channel planned to be involved in coverage. In 2017, Univision acquired Spanish-language rights to the UEFA Champions League and Europa League beginning in 2018-19. In 2013, it acquired the U.S. Spanish-language rights to Formula One.However, ESPN Deportes acquired formula one starting 2020. =Soccer= CONCACAF: * CONCACAF Champions League * CONCACAF Gold Cup * CONCACAF Nations League * CONCACAF Under-17 Championship * CONCACAF Under-20 Championship : * Campe√≥n de Campeones * Copa MX * Liga MX **Am√©rica ** Atlas ** Ju√°rez ** Cruz Azul ** Le√≥n ** Morelia ** Necaxa ** Pachuca ** Puebla ** Quer√©taro ** Toluca ** UANL ** UNAM * Mexico national football team * Supercopa MX : * MLS * MLS All-Star Game the * United States men's national soccer team * United States women's national soccer team UEFA (2018-2022): * UEFA Euro 2020 * European Qualifiers * UEFA Champions League * UEFA Europa League * UEFA Super Cup * UEFA Nations League =Martial arts= * Combate Americas =Professional wrestling= * CMLL Super Viernes =Former programming= Soccer * FIFA tournaments : * Ligue 1 : * Liga MX: Guadalajara, Monterrey, Santos Laguna, Tijuana and Veracruz home matches : * Eredivisie : * Primeira Liga * Bundesliga =Motorsports= * Formula One Controversies =Carriage disputes= Univision Deportes Network, Univision, UniM√°s, Galavisi√≥n and Univision Tlnovelas were dropped by AT&T; U-verse on March 4, 2016, due to a carriage dispute.

Te Puni belonged to the NgƒÅti Te Whiti and NgƒÅti Tawhirikura hap≈´ of Te ƒÄtiawa. Born in Taranaki his mother was Te Puku and his father was the chief Rerewha- i-te-rangi. He acquired the name 'Te Puni-kokopu' ('puni' for pool, 'kokopu' for fresh water fish) as a young man, when to escape an invading force attacking Rewarewa pa (located near to present-day New Plymouth) he and his father's younger brother Raua-ki-tua leapt from the pa down a cliff-face into the Waiwhakaiho River and swam to safety. Te Puni was closely associated with his younger cousin Te Wharep≈çuri. In about 1820 the two were part of the defence of Pukerangiora pa in Taranaki, and in 1822 both were part of the battle against Waikato fighters at Motunui. He and Te Wharep≈çuri made contact with whalers and traders Dicky Barrett and Jacky Love in Ngamotu (now New Plymouth) in the 1820s. In about 1828 Te Puni sailed to Sydney on board the Tohora. In 1832, realising that the invasions from Waikato iwi were not going to cease, a large number of Te Ati Awa, including Te Puni, Te Wharep≈çuri, Te Puni's uncle Raua-ki-tua, Ngatata-i-te-rangi and his son Wi Tako NgƒÅtata, and the families of Love and Barrett, migrated overland south to Waikanae and Te Whanganui-a-Tara (Wellington Harbour). The migration is known as Te Heke Tama- te-uaua. Over the next few years Te Puni moved around the wider Wellington region, settling for times in Waikanae, near Porirua, in Featherston, and on Matiu / Somes Island. By 1836 Te Wharep≈çuri was settled in Ngauranga and Te Puni was invited from Matiu / Somes Island to settle in Pito-one (present-day Petone). On 27 September 1839, Te Puni signed a deed of settlement with the New Zealand Company that saw the purchase of much of the Wellington region by British settlers. Te Puni was also a signatory to the Treaty of Waitangi, signing Sheet 8, The Cook Strait (Henry Williams) Sheet, in Wellington on 29 April 1840. Te Puni died on 5 December 1870 and was buried in the family ≈´r≈´pa (cemetery) two days later with a funeral that came close in scale to a state funeral. The ship Rangatira sailed from Wellington to Petone carrying soldiers and the garrison band; banks, government offices and many shops were closed. The Bishop of Wellington, Octavius Hadfield, read the funeral service in MƒÅori and three volleys were fired over Te Puni‚Äôs grave by members of the Hutt Volunteers. Memorials The Lower Hutt suburb of Epuni is named after Te Puni; it is an erroneous form of the chief's name recorded by early Wellington settlers. Te Puni Street in Petone is named after his whanau (family), and an Oamaru stone memorial was erected in 1872 in his memory in the Te Puni ≈´r≈´pa (cemetery) two years after his death, designed by Colonial Architect William Clayton. In 1940 Deputy Prime Minister Walter Nash laid a wreath at the memorial as part of commemorations of Wellington's centennial. Te Puni is depicted on a large glass window on the Wellington Provincial Centennial Memorial welcoming British settlers to the harbour.

He was from the NgƒÅpuhi iwi and lived in the Rangihoua Bay area of the Bay of Islands. In 1805 Te Pahi decided to seek out Lieutenant Governor Philip Gidley King who, ten years earlier, had visited New Zealand from Norfolk Island. Lieutenant Governor King had won the respect and gratitude of the Maoris for his treatment of the two young men, Tookee and Huru, who had been kidnapped and taken to Norfolk Island to help in the manufacture of cloth from flax. At considerable personal cost King decided to return the young men in the whaler Britannia himself and he provided their chiefs with gifts of iron tools and pigs, recording his view that being on good terms with the Maoris would be of great benefit to Great Britain.Journal of P G King 1791-1796, Mitchell Library On arrival at Norfolk Island in 1805 Te Pahi found that King was no longer there and the then Superintendent of the island, Captain Piper, arranged for him to continue his journey to Port Jackson where King had become Governor. On his arrival in Port Jackson on 27 November 1805, Te Pahi was received as an honoured guest by the New South Wales Governor Captain Philip Gidley King, who presented him with a medal to recognise his visit. It was the first State gift presented to a MƒÅori rangatira. King also presented Te Pahi with a prefabricated brick house which was built in his pƒÅ on Motu Apo Island and was the first permanent European style house in New Zealand. During the visit Te Pahi also met Samuel Marsden, chaplain of New South Wales. Te Pahi attended church services and discussed religion with Marsden, who formed plans for a Church Missionary Society mission under Te Pahi's protection at Rangihoua. Te Pahi was incorrectly blamed for the burning of the Boyd incident in 1809 and his pƒÅ on Motu Apo was stormed by crew from several whaling ships in retaliation in 1810. The whalers murdered many people, looted the island and destroyed houses including the gift from King. Te Pahi was wounded in the attack on his island but his death several weeks later was as the result of other wounds he received in a conflict with MƒÅori from the Whangaroa region over the Boyd affair. He was succeeded as chief of the Rangihoua Bay area by Ruatara. Stolen medal reappears The silver medal presented to Te Pahi was stolen during the raid by the whalers in 1810, and its whereabouts remained unknown until 204 years later when an auction house in Sydney offered it for sale. Ngapuhi representatives and Te Pahi descendants intervened to try to return the taonga back to New Zealand, and they negotiated with Te Papa and the Auckland War Memorial Trust who jointly purchased the medal. The medal was purchased at an auction in Sydney in 2014 and put on display at Te Papa in 2017.

It consists of twenty-six pieces written over a period of more than twenty years. The anthology includes a range of formats, including essays, magazine pieces, album reviews, and forewords from other published works. Background Since making a name for himself as a leading figure in the cyberpunk genre with his Sprawl trilogy of novels, Gibson has been primarily known as a writer of science or speculative fiction. However, beginning in the late eighties, he has regularly penned non- fiction pieces for various publications. Gibson credits his agent for the idea of a collection; according to the writer, the book was intended to bridge the gap between Zero History (2010), his then-most recent novel, and his next work of fiction. Content The pieces in Distrust That Particular Flavor were written between the late 1980s and 2010. Some were originally published as magazine articles in Time, Rolling Stone, and Wired. Some appeared as forewords to books by other authors. Several speeches appear in written form for the first time. In \\"Disneyland with the Death Penalty\\", which originally appeared in a 1993 issue of Wired, Gibson reflects on the state of Singapore. Criticisms in the article resulted in the Singapore government banning Wired from the country. The essay \\"Rocket Radio\\", which appeared in Rolling Stone, covers the evolution of communications from the crystal radio to the Internet. Written in the late 1980s, it features Gibson theorizing on the future of the then-nascent Net. \\"Dead Man Sings\\" takes a more autobiographical note; memories of his childhood are interspersed with an exploration of visual and audio media, and their effect on time. The writer delves into psychogeography in his review of Peter Ackroyd's London: The Biography, entitled \\"Metrophagy: the Art and Science of Digesting Cities\\". Several pieces cover music and fine arts. \\"Any Mount of the World\\" is a review of a Steely Dan live album. Gibson is a fan of the group. \\"Introduction: The Body\\" looks at the Australian- Cypriot performance artist Stelarc.

It is common in mangrove swamps from Bangladesh, India in the northwest to Australia in the southeast, within Australia, it thrives from northern New South Wales along the northern coastline around to Western Australia. It is also found on the shores of the Philippine Islands.Given such a wide range, it is understandable that the species has many common names including: Thillai, milky mangrove, blind-your-eye mangrove and river poison tree. Most of the names refer to its poisonous or blinding nature.  Description  Mangrove swamps form a type of coastal wetland found in the tropics and subtropics. Within a mangrove forest, the most salt- tolerant species occur near the ocean. Excoecaria agallocha, known as a back mangrove, is found at higher elevations back away from the ocean where salinity is lower.Joshi, H. and M. Ghose. 2003. Forest structure and species distribution along soil salinity and pH gradient in mangrove swamps of the Sundarbans. Tropical Ecology 44: 197-206. Mangroves of this plant surround the ancient Thillai Chidambaram Temple in Tamil Nadu. This small tree species may grow up to 15 m high. Trees are either male or female. Male flowers form drooping tassels, while female flowers appear as shorter spikes. Pollinators such as bees commonly visit the flowers. The fruit is a small dark capsule. The plant is well-protected by chemical defenses; these include diterpenoids, triterpenoids and flavonoids.Zou JH, Dai J, Chen X, and Yuan JQ. 2006. Pentacyclic triterpenoids from leaves of Excoecaria agallocha. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo) 54:920-921. The milky latex of Excoecaria agallocha is very poisonous and powerfully irritant, which is not unusual in milky species of plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. Contact with skin causes irritation and rapid blistering; slight contact with eyes can cause temporary blindness, hence the common names that refer to blindness. Even the generic name is from the Latin for \\"blinder\\". William Bligh in his book \\"A Voyage to the South Sea\\" mentioned that he was already aware of this hazard when he embarked on the voyage that ended in the notorious mutiny on the Bounty, having learned of it in 1777 from Captain James Cook during the time that he served as Cook's sailing master. Several of the men that Cook had sent ashore to cut wood had been blinded for a time. He accordingly instructed his men not to cut that type of tree when he sent them ashore in Tahiti to gather wood and water in 1789.Bligh, William. A Voyage to the South Sea. 1792 From Project Gutenberg at It was just as well that he did so, because even the smoke from the burning wood is poisonous and can harm the eyes, so it would not have been useful as fuel.  Taxonomy  Excoecaria agallocha, a mangrove species, belongs to the genus Excoecaria of the family Euphorbiaceae.  Uses  Even dried and powdered leaves retain the poison and can kill fish very quickly or be used on a poison dart. Excoecaria agallocha has been found to have various medicinal and pharmacological benefits, including the treatment for epilepsy, ulcers, leprosy, rheumatism, and paralysis. Owing to its complex chemistry, the plant may have many new medicinal uses.Konoshima,T, T. Konishi, M. Takasaki, K. Yamazoe, and H. Tokuda. 2001.

Born probably in Taranaki in the early years of the nineteenth century, he was first known as Moki. In the 1820s and 1830s he was caught up in his tribe's resistance to a series of Waikato raids. After a Waikato victory at Maru, at the base of Mt Taranaki, in 1826, he became the leader of some 120 men and their families who stayed within the protection of Te Namu pa, near Opunake, when the remainder of the Taranaki tribe migrated to the Kapiti coast about 1827. Moki and his people were able to obtain muskets from European flax traders who had settled at Ngamotu, near present-day New Plymouth, in 1828. When in 1833 Waikato laid siege to Te Namu, Moki distinguished himself by his marksmanship and received the name Te Matakatea, the clear-eyed. Waikato retreated but, sensing that this was only a temporary reprieve, Te Matakatea led his people a few miles south to a complex of three pa at the mouth of the Kapuni Stream, in the territory of his Ngati Ruanui relatives.

Te Kawau's father was Tarahawaiki and his grandfather was T≈´periri, the principal leader of Te Tao≈´ hap≈´ (sub-tribe) of NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua who overran the TƒÅmaki isthmus in the 1740s, defeating the Wai-o- Hua. Te Kawau's mother was Mokorua, who was descended from the Wai-o-Hua. Te Kawau was born at IhumƒÅtao, near the Manukau Harbour. Te Kawau is thought to have fought against the NgƒÅpuhi iwi in the NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua victory of Battle of Moremonui in 1807 or 1808. He then helped lead the 1,000 mile long NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua and NgƒÅti Maniapoto cannibalistic war expedition known as (encircling the land) from 1821 to 1822. After a major defeat to NgƒÅpuhi at Te Ika-a- ranga-nui in 1825, Te Kawau and his people left the TƒÅmaki isthmus (the future site of Auckland) for several years. On 20 March 1840 in the Manukau Harbour area where NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua farmed, Te Kawau signed the Treaty of Waitangi. NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua sought British protection from NgƒÅpuhi as well as a reciprocal relationship with the Crown and the Church. Soon after signing the Treaty, Te Kawau made land on the WaitematƒÅ Harbour available for the new capital of Auckland. Te Kawau was associated with the Church Mission Society (CMS) since meeting Samuel Marsden in 1820, and the two men become friends. During the 1840s, some time after becoming a Christian, he was baptised by Bishop George Selwyn at the chapel near ≈årƒÅkei PƒÅ and was given the baptismal name of ƒÄpihai, MƒÅori for the biblical warrior Abishai. In the 1850s Te Kawau was an assessor involved with settling disputes between MƒÅori in Auckland. Known then as a peaceful man, he spoke publicly against land sales, but was unable to stop Governor George Grey's evictions and confiscations. In 1868 he secured the title to the last 700 acres of NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua land in Orakei for his iwi. Te Kawau was the uncle of PƒÅora T≈´haere, who succeeded him as a leader of NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua. In 2018 NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua-o-≈årƒÅkei and the Ports of Auckland created a memorial to Te Kawau for his gifting of land to Governor Hobson and commemorating his contributions to Auckland, while marking the place where the city was founded on 18 September 1840.

Of MƒÅori descent, he identified with Hapu Matua of the Te Aitanga A Hauiti Iwi. He was born in on the East Coast of New Zealand. He is well known for having refused to sign the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840.  Ancestry  NB: This section is derived from text in available here at the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre. Te Kani-a-Takirau was born at the close of the eighteenth century. He was descended from Konohi, who lived at Whangara, and whose principal wife was Hinekino. Their eldest son, Marakauiti, (not to be confused with the MƒÅori youth of the same name who was one of the guests aboard HMS Endeavour in Poverty Bay) had two wives, and his brother, Te Rewai, was the husband of three women. With Puhinga, his principal wife, Marakauiti fathered Tane Tokorangi. When Tane reached manhood, Konohi had a quarrel with Rerekohu, another East Coast chief. As a peace offering Rerekohu handed over to Konohi two women of high rank, one being Ngunguru, who was given to Tane to be his wife. It was as a result of this union that Hinematioro, the great ‚ÄúQueen of the East Coast,‚Äù was born. She chose Te Hoa-a-Tiki as her husband, a grandson of Te Rewai, her great uncle. Their daughter, Ngarangi-Kahiwa, married Te Rongo Pumamao, who was a great grandson of the second wife of Marakauiti, one of her own great grandfathers. Te Kani was the offspring of this marriage, and he was, therefore, the child of a union between a great grandson and a great granddaughter of Marakauiti, but who were descended from different wives. Although Te Kani had at least three wives he had no children. The introduction of Ngunguru into Te Kani's family tree gave him the distinction of being descended from a famous couple‚ÄîTahito-kuru Maranga and Tao Putaputa‚Äîwho, according to tradition, were united in wedlock after a love charm worked successfully. Tahito, it is stated, dwelt in Titirangi pa on Kaiti Hill (Gisborne) circa 1500. He visited Opotiki to court Tao, but was not received favourably by her. Upon his return home he made an atahuoi, or neck pendant. Elsdon Best considered that it might have been composed of part of a bird's skin saturated in oil expressed from the seeds of the fruit of the titoki and scented by the inclusion of fragrant leaves, moss or gum. Tahito placed the atahuoi in a ngaruru (large Trochus) shell, repeated a love charm over it, and instructed it to go quickly to Opape (near Opotiki), where Tao was in the habit of gathering pƒÅua. One day, whilst Tao was on the beach, the only thing that she found was the ngaruru shell, and she threw it away. No matter which part of the beach she examined, the shell turned up. When she returned to the camp fire her basket was empty, although her companions had had no difficulty in filling theirs. To her friends she remarked: ‚ÄúA ngaruru was the only thing I saw. Even although I moved from place to place I was followed by the shell.‚Äù Next day, when she returned to the beach, there was the faithful ngaruru, and Tao placed it in her basket. Whilst she was sitting in front of the fire that evening she noticed the strand of the pendant, and placed it on her necklet. Soon Tahito's love began to affect her overwhelmingly. Brought close to the embers, the ngaruru is said to have opened its lips and to have told her the old, old story in the form of a lament which Tahito had composed. Said the cockle: ‚ÄúWhen Tahito flung me on the waters, he cried: ‚ÄòTell of my love to, Tao,‚Äô and I, now dying, am fulfilling the trust that he reposed in me.‚Äù No time was lost by Tao in hitting the Kowhai trail leading to Poverty Bay, and, soon, she was in the arms of the waiting Tahito, of whom Ngunguru, a great grandmother of Te Kani, was a descendant. Te Kani must have owed much to Hinematioro, whose fame, on account of her kindly disposition, spread far and wide. She would never permit the slaying of anybody to provide food, no matter how meagre the supplies on hand. When Marsden was at Rangihoua in 1820 he met a young East Coast captive woman, who claimed to be a niece of ‚ÄúHina, a great Queen,‚Äù of whom, he said, he had often heard. Upon Te Wera's return from his first lengthy expedition to the south in April, 1821, he told the Rev. J. Butler that the chief place which he had visited was ‚ÄúEnamatteeora,‚Äù about from the Bay of Islands‚Äîclearly a reference to the district ruled over by Hinematioro. Like some other distinguished figures in MƒÅoridom, Hinematioro met a violent death. Pakira, who resided in the Waiapu district, was insulted by a brother-in-law named Whakarara, whose abode was at Marahea. When Whakarara heard that Pakira was on the way to attack his pa, he went to Tolaga Bay to secure the protection of Hinematioro, leaving behind a message for Pakira that he should be well content with the sands of Anaura for utu (compensation). Pakira, however, continued to pursue Whakarara, who took refuge on Pourewa Island. When Pourewa pa was about to fall into Pakira's hands Hinematioro was assisted down a cliff and placed in a canoe, which made off towards Whangara Island. W. L. Williams was told that the canoe upset, and that Te Kani was the only survivor. Smith says that her remains were buried on Whangara Island. When the ownership of Pourewa Island was being investigated by Judges Heale and O'Brien in July, 1881, evidence was tendered to the effect that the canoe was overtaken, and that Hinematioro was taken back to the island, where she was slain and her heart was roasted and eaten. This event occurred circa 1823.  Biography  NB: This section is derived from text in available here at the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre. D'Urville, commander of the French vessel L'Astrolabe, which visited Tolaga Bay in 1827, gives the earliest pen-picture of Te Kani. It seems that, at the outset, he allowed on board only Te Rangui-Wai-Hetouma (Rangiuia), who claimed to be the principal rangatira of the district. Next day some other chiefs were denied a like privilege, ‚Äúalthough with visible repugnance.‚Äù One of them (Te Kani) would not obey the sentinel, and, trembling with rage, left only when peremptorily ordered by D'Urville to do so. He was hardly 30 years old, and became known to the voyagers as ‚ÄúShaki.‚Äù On account of Te Kani's stature and haughty appearance, and the air of submission adopted by those who surrounded him, it soon became obvious that he was a chief. Moreover, a young woman in his canoe, who spoke a mixture of English and MƒÅori, kept on repeating, with extraordinary volubility, that Shaki, her master, was a great chief and friend of the English, and that it was very bad on D'Urville's part not to receive him. As Rangiuia admitted that Shaki was a great chief, D'Urville signalled him to come on board, and, after explaining to him that he had not been aware of his high birth, made him a few gifts. Soon they became the best of friends. Shortly afterwards an uproar arose when another canoe appeared with two old and more heavily tattooed chiefs. Te Kani invited D'Urville to frighten them away; he even went so far as to demand a musket so that he could fire at them. When the newcomers accepted an invitation to go on board, however, Te Kani adopted a very modest demeanour towards them, offering them some large hatchets which he had received as gifts. Suddenly the elderly chiefs left the ship. When D'Urville sought an explanation, he was told that Te Kani and his companions had given the hatchets to the chiefs to let them know they were going to be killed. According to Smith, Te Kani was ‚Äúone of those great chiefs who seemed more like the arikis of Central Polynesia than were usually found in New Zealand.‚Äù Major Ropata Wahawaha claimed that ‚Äúall the lines of Maori aristocratic descent converged in Te Kani; that he could trace his ancestors back to MƒÅui-Potiki, and that his mana (authority) extended from Whangaparaoa to Mahia.‚Äù Polack, who first met Te Kani at Tolaga Bay in June, 1835, describes him as noble in appearance, above 6 feet tall, and about 36 years old. He adds: ‚ÄúHis handsome countenance was but little marked with the moko, and was garnished with a large, dark, bushy beard, which gave him the appearance of an Arab of Mocha.‚Äù Following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti), Henry Williams arrived in Poverty Bay on 8 April 1840 on the ship Ariel with a MƒÅori-language copy of te Tiriti ('T≈´ranga Treaty copy'). Between 5 May and 9 June 1840, William Williams, presented the T≈´ranga Treaty copy to rangatira at T≈´ranga, Uawa, WakawitirƒÅ, Rangitukia and Tokomaru so that those East Coast chiefs could sign; 41 signatures appear on the T≈´ranga Treaty copy, a number of important rangatira refused to sign, including Te Kani. Sir Donald McLean, who met Te Kani in Poverty Bay in 1851, says, in his journal (Alexander Turnbull Library), that Te Kani frankly welcomed him, ‚Äúalthough he was taken rather by surprise when I got up to him.‚Äù His only emblem of chieftainship was ‚Äúa bone mere decorated with tapes of hair about the handle, which he waved carelessly about in his right hand as he rode on horseback.‚Äù McLean adds, inter alia: ‚ÄúHe is a fine, nice-looking man, but not strikingly so‚Äînot nearly so much determination in his features as Te Hapuku possesses, nor even so much of the gentleman in appearance as Te Rawiri, a cousin of his at Turanganui‚Äîbut, in reality, he is freely acknowledged by all the natives to be one of the greatest men on this side of the island.‚Äù In an address at Gisborne in 1901, Joseph Goadley Baker (who was taken to Tolaga Bay by his parents in 1843) described Te Kani as ‚Äúa man of princely appearance, tall and handsome, with curly, auburn hair and possessing all the qualities of one of Nature's gentlemen.‚Äù Te Kani, he said, was looked upon as sacred by his people, and, he could sway them by a word or a wave of the hand. He was a great friend of the Europeans, and put off all restraint whilst in their company. Although such a good friend to the missionaries, he never accepted Christianity, nor would he attend public worship. Mr. Baker added: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, he became addicted to strong drink, which brought him to an untimely end.‚Äù It is stated by Smith that Te Kani took part in a battle which was fought on the banks of the Waipaoa River in 1820‚Äì21, when NgƒÅpuhi, under Te Wera and Tƒ´tore, and war parties of Waikato and Ngati-Maniapoto crushed Rongowhakaata and their allies. The slain included three of his brothers (or, perhaps, cousins), and he escaped only by jumping into a canoe and paddling for dear life to a pa at the mouth of the river. This engagement does not appear in E. F. Harris's list of battles fought in Poverty Bay, and no reference to it has been found in the Native Land Court minute books. Nor are any details available concerning a battle in Poverty Bay in which, according to Polack, Te Kani was taken prisoner, and, afterwards, ‚Äúformed a serail from the families of his captors.‚Äù Te Kani died on Paremata block (Tolaga Bay) in 1856 after a lingering illness. By stages his body was taken to Whangara. Some accounts state that the burial took, place, first of all, in the village, and that, subsequently, the remains were removed on to the island. However, Richard Leach, of Whangara, pointed out to Joseph Angus Mackay a clump of trees to the north-east of the village, which, he said, sheltered Te Kani's last resting place.  MƒÅori Kingship  NB: This section is derived from text in available here at the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre. Many conjectures have been made as to why the Poverty Bay and East Coast tribes stood aloof from the MƒÅori King Movement in 1856 and 1857, seeing that most of their members denied allegiance to Queen Victoria. Mr. Wardell, R.M., was of the opinion that it was because they were jealous of the Waikato tribes. He says that the chiefs along the East Coast did discuss the propriety of appointing a king of their own, but that rivalry among the principal leaders prevented them from doing so. Te Kani had died in 1856. James Cowan informed Joseph Angus Mackay that, when Tamihana Kuta and Matene te Whiwhi began their crusade in 1852 in support of the appointment of a Maori king, Te Kani was, he understood, the first great chief to whom the kingship was offered. At any rate, his name was mentioned as that of a suitable chief for the position. Personally, he had never made any inquiries on the subject from East Coast MƒÅori. He added that P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero was chosen at Taupo in 1856, and that his appointment was confirmed in the Waikato in 1857. On the other hand, the Rev. T. S. Grace (then stationed at Pukawa, Taupo) states, in his annual report for 1856, that no selection was made at the Maori Congress in 1856. He adds: ‚ÄúOur great chief (Te Heuheu), whom they wished to appoint, declared himself on the side of the Queen.‚Äù Among East Coast MƒÅori it is firmly believed that Te Kani was approached. One of their versions states that the envoys were Tamihana and Matene and another that Te Heuheu himself visited Uawa. No reference to any such visit appears in the writings either of W. Williams or of W. L. Williams. J. G. Baker (a son of the Rev. Charles Baker) was emphatic that, long before hostilities broke out in Taranaki or in Waikato, deputations from Taupo, Waikato and elsewhere visited Te Kani, whose reply was that it would be impossible for anyone to confer upon him a title greater than that which was his birthright, and, therefore, he could not accept any new‚Äîand what to him would be only a hollow‚Äîtitle. A monster r≈´nanga (discussion) was held at Poverty Bay on 21 May 1858. Mr Wardell described it to the Governor as ‚Äúthe most influential and most numerously attended that has taken place since my arrival.‚Äù In none of the speeches was there support for the Queen's authority. All that the leaders were prepared to receive from Europeans was Christianity. Rutene Piwaka complained about the changes that had been made in the prayer book. ‚ÄúThe first prayer book,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúcontained a prayer for the rangatira Maori and their families. In the second edition the prayer was for the Queen and the rangatira Maori. The prayer in the third edition was for the Queen and her family alone. Let the pakehas pray for the Queen if they like, but we will not call her our Queen, nor will we recognise her authority.‚Äù There was a general feeling that the magistrate should be withdrawn. The position grew steadily worse. In April, 1859, delegates from East Cape attended a meeting at Pawhakairo (H.B.) at which Tamihana was present. All the tribes were advised to cancel all leases to PƒÅkehƒÅ and to repurchase lands that had been parted with. Some of the Hawke's Bay chiefs proved unwilling to relinquish the rents which they were receiving.

Thomas, 565 U.S. 266 (2012), is a United States Supreme Court ruling in which the Court ruled 7‚Äì2 that Cory R. Maples, who had been convicted of murdering two people and faced a possible death sentence, should get another opportunity in court because his lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell had abandoned him. Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented from the Court's holding, arguing that the procedural default shouldn't be excused. Facts In 1997 Cory Maples was convicted of murder in Alabama and sentenced to death. Alabama does not provide death row inmates with lawyers to appeal their convictions and sentences so they must rely on pro bono lawyers to represent them. Two lawyers from the New York law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell agreed to represent Maples free of charge. Those lawyers later quit the law firm and when the Alabama court sent copies of a ruling in Maples' case to the firm's mail room, the law firm returned the copies unopened. The law firm never notified the court or the mail room that new lawyers had taken over the case. Because this information was never received the deadline for appeal was missed. When Maples learned of the missed deadline, he had his step-mother contact the law firm. The lawyers now handling the case asked for permission to appeal despite missing the original deadline, but that request was denied.https://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2011/2011_10_63 Background The sixth amendment gives defendants the right to counsel. The Supreme Court ruled in 1976 (citing Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387 at 398) that a defendant's right to an attorney attaches \\"at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against him, whether by formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CONAN-2002/pdf/GPO- CONAN-2002-9-7.pdf Decision On January 18, 2012, the Supreme Court decided in favor of Cory Maples because of the special circumstances of his case. The unannounced and unauthorized abandonment of Maples' case by his lawyers proved significant enough to excuse the defendant from having failed to file an appeal in advance of the deadline. Opinion of the Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court. The Court reversed the findings of the circuit court and discussed Alabama‚Äôs practices in regard to post- conviction representation. The Court held that because Maples' non-compliance with State rules were set in motion by external circumstance outside of his knowledge or control for which he could not be held responsible. Attorney negligence does not normally excuse the client from responsibility because the attorney is acting as an agent to the client and the client is therefore responsible and able to manage the actions of his attorney. In Maples' case, however, he was abandoned, without notice, by his attorneys and this effectively severed the relationship. Concurring opinion Justice Samuel Alito wrote a concurring opinion. Dissenting opinion Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion. Scalia agreed that abandonment was a legitimate reason to sever the relationship but that Maples had not been abandoned. He was, without interruption, represented by Sullivan and Cromwell and John Butler, an Alabama attorney.https://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2011/2011_10_63#mla References Further reading * External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:2012 in United States case law Category:United States death penalty case law Category:Capital punishment in Alabama Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court ","title":"Maples v.

This place dates back to the 9th and 10th century AD. Excavation and ruins here shows the prosperity and might of Pala dynasty of Kamarupa. The ruins of Madan Kamdev are scattered widely in a secluded place, covering 500 meters. Temple of Kamdev must be reconstruction, Uma Maheshwar's embraced idols, carved on the stones of medieval temples, can be seen here. The most prominent statues are of the Sun, Ganesha, and Vidyadhara Discovery and excavation Archeologists differed on the issue of when and who constructed these temples. Dr. Pradeep Sharma, assistant director of the Archaeological Directorate and Assam, suggests that Captain Daltan's writings in 1855 about 15 temple ruins found around the Silsako Bridge (a historical bridge destroyed in the 1897 Assam earthquake), might have referred to Madan Kamdev. (These were published in Daltan's Asian Society of Bengal (1855) magazine.) In 1943 and 1949, Tarnikant Sharma, inspector of primary education, affirmed this information in an article published by the Assam research society (Kamarupa Anusandhan Samiti). No excavations were conducted for more than a quarter century after this article. During that period, religious people of the villages took the previous statues away, or hunters carried them from one place to another. In 1977, the Archaeological Directorate of Assam took over the responsibility for this area. They started the excavations of the statues under the supervision of Dr. Pradeep Sharma. In addition to the main temple, his team found ruins of 12 more temples. Analysis of the temples and the idols engraved on the walls, led them to conclude these were constructed from the 10th century to the 12th century. According to Dr. Sharma, Kamarupa kings of Pala dynasty, namely Ratna Pala, Indra Pala and Go Pala, ordered construction of these temples. Statues of Bhairav with six heads, a four-headed Shiva, Kalpavriksha, Sun various Apsara, Vishnu with six heads, Saraswati and various other statues of animals have been identified as being from here. Environment In the year 1977, when this area was protected and exploration and preservation began, the hill was surrounded by immense variety of forests, filled with snakes, scorpions, and wild animals such as deer and tigers. Birds sing and chirp in the trees. Right below the Kamdev, the River Madankuri flows in the east and towards the north. Beneath the hill is a vast stretch of swampy land; a chain of hills of Gopeshwar runs from the north to west, and Natuar nacha and Sangsari in the east. Puranic beliefs are still based on Madan Kamdev. One account says that God Shiva in a spurt of fury had burnt the god of love,Kam or Madan, to cinders. Madan was reborn at this place. Architecture Madan-Kamdev is the main temple, with ruins of other huge and small temples scattered around it. Representatives of the Architectural Directorate believe that excavation may reveal an additional twelve temples. Near Madan Kamdev, an old temple of lord Shiva, known here as Gopeshwar, is located in the village of Deuduar. Nearby is a large cave known as Parvati Guha (Parvati Cave), after his consort.

The party, banned by the government of Syria since its establishment, was victim to a number of crackdowns, where 200 of its members were arrested in 1986 alone. 21 members were sentenced by the Supreme State Security Court for \\"membership in a secret organization created to change the economic or social structure of the state\\". Amnesty International protested on behalf of the prisoners.

On 6 August 2003, the party announced its return to the political scene in a statement, followed by a new publication called al-An (\\"Now\\"). The party is led by Fateh Jamous, who was imprisoned between 1982 and 2000. He was again arrested in 2006. The party worked with a Palestinian dissident group, called the Palestinian Popular Committees, in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus. The group was founded in 1983. The Palestinian Popular Committees were disbanded in 1985, as a campaign of arrests was launched against the Syrian party. One of the sentenced activists of the party, Tuhama Mahmoud Ma'rouf, received a suspended sentence in 1995, only to be rearrested and ordered to begin serving her sentence in 2010 for unknown reasons. In February 2011, she began a hunger strike protesting the conditions of her detainment at Adra prison. She was released on 20 June of that year in a mass presidential amnesty for political dissidents. In early 2018, the party condemned the Turkish military operation in Afrin.

Biography Hepi Te Heuheu was born in Wellington, New Zealand, on 26 January 1919. He was the son of Hoani Te Heuheu and his wife Raukawa Tawhirau Maniapoto, the daughter of Te Maniapoto and Wakahuia of Taupo. He married Pauline Hinepoto (Tuutu) Te Moanapapaku, of NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa and NgƒÅti Maru descent, and had six children. After his father died on 27 April 1944, Hepi succeeded him as elected chief of NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa at the age of 25, in a ceremony conducted by the MƒÅori King, Korokƒ´. In his early years as chief, he concentrated on promoting the tribe's economic foundation through the development of farms and forests. He was influential in selling many lands early settlers required to developed, with strong opposition from traditionally non-selling families. Through his leadership, many families lost thousands of acres of ancestral lands, however it secured his goodwill with the Pakeha government. From 1956 until his death he was chair of the T≈´wharetoa Trust Board. His leadership led to the tribe becoming one of the strongest and most independent MƒÅori tribes. He was also a member of the board of the Tongariro National Park. He was a key figure in forming the Federation of Maori Authorities in 1985‚Äì86 and was its first chair. He led representations to the government in 1985 which resulted in the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi being protected in the State Owned Enterprises Act 1986. He was instrumental in the formation of the National Maori Congress in 1990. He led the congress in a successful effort to retain and increase the number of MƒÅori electorates, and in opposition to the Runanga Iwi Act 1990 which was repealed in 1991. Then in 1995 he played a leading role in opposing the government's proposal to set a capped budget (\\"fiscal envelope\\") for the settlement of historic Treaty of Waitangi claims.
