The episode originally aired on May 27, 2012, on Showcase. The episode was written by Simon Barry and directed by Jon Cassar. Plot The episode opens with Edouard Kagame (Tony Amendola) delivering a speech about how 20 years prior, the corporations of the world bailed out the failing Governments becoming the Corporate Congress, and that while at first it was seen as a saving grace, it is now seen as a dictatorship that removed all personal dignity and freedom. His speech is interrupted by City Protection Service (CPS) who arrest him for being the leader of the terrorist organisation Liber8. He tells them that they are too late and Officer Kiera Cameron (Rachel Nichols) and the other officers of CPS watch as Liber8 destroy two skyscrapers. Six months later, in Kiera's house, it is the eve of the execution of the leading members of Liber8 where it is revealed that they destroyed the skyscrapers in order to kill 20 corporate heads at the expense of tens of thousands of innocents. During the execution, Liber8 members are each given one piece of a Time Travel device. Kiera notices this and yells that they have something causing her and her partner Elena (Caitlin Cromwell) to run forwards as the terrorists throw each part of the device into the central power beam in front of them. The device produces a small sphere of energy that teleports them backwards in time 65 years to 2012. Kiera wakes up in modern-day Vancouver and discovers that she in communication with Alec Sadler (Erik Knudsen) whom she met in 2077 as the head (William B. Davis)of the biggest corporation. She gives chase to Lucas Ingram (Omari Newton) who she manages to get arrested for threatening police officers with a weapon. Meanwhile, the remaining terrorists break into a weapons shop and reveal that Kagame did not make it through the time jump. The next day she goes to the site at which she and the terrorists had landed and meets Detective Carlos Fonnegra (Victor Webster). She manages to fake her way into the police department to interrogate Lucas by pretending to be from the Portland police department. Afterwards she is called in to see Inspector Dillon (Brian Markinson) who is annoyed that the Portland police department had set up an operation in his territory without telling him. He almost blows Kiera's cover by phoning Portsmouth but is interrupted by the report that Liber8 has attacked a police patrol and taken all of the weapons as well as setting off multiple bank alarms across the city. Kiera quickly figures out that the bank they are robbing is the final alarm to be triggered. After escaping the police ambush, Liber8 escapes into an abandoned building followed shortly by Kiera. After a brief firefight, Stefan Jaworski (Mike Dopud) is taken down by an electrical charge sent through some wire from Kiera's suit. Kiera is saved from a sneak attack from Stefan by Carlos while Matthew Kellog (Stephen Lobo) and Curtis Chen (Terry Chen) escape. Kiera then asks Carlos how many were in the bank and he replies just the three that they had just fought. Kiera then suddenly realises that the remaining members of Liber8 are attacking the police building to rescue Lucas from holding. The two of them return to find many people either wounded or being taken out on stretchers.

He also noted that while the focus on the futuristic technology, although he also noted that \\"the climatic shoot-out does hint that the suit will become a deus ex machina in the writers' arsenal.\\" Randy Dankievitch of Processed Media gave a mainly negative review, stating that while she has some hopes for the show, she was disappointed at the fact Kiera faked her way into the police department \\"Through some really inexplicably lame plot convolution\\". She notes that Alec's character in central to all major plot points but states that Kiera's determination to return to her family is going to have to change to keep her personal story interesting. She also commented that the shootouts were unneeded and drawn out. Overall she gave the episode a B-. Matt Fowler of IGN gave a mostly positive review stating that the question of Time Travel was dealt with but not dealt with by two different possibilities being stated with one possibility being leaned on more than the other. He did however explain that Kiera corporation with the VPD relied on them ditching \\"all sorts of usual cop protocol in order to just follow this freaky, pretty newcomer on faith.\\" Jayne Nelson of SFX gave a positive review of the episode, commenting on the likeness of Erik Knudsen and William B Davis who play the young and old Alec respectively. She also noted that Director Jon Casser had done a brilliant job with the episode, in particular a scene where Liber8 walk down an alley in Slow Motion.

It was published by Riverhead Books in 2012. In the book, Rosin argues that patriarchy is coming to an end. She writes about the dominance of women in US schools and workplaces. Overview Rosin's text was published in 2012 by Riverhead Books. In the text, she theorizes that women have won the gender war, having \\"pulled decisively ahead [of men] by almost every measure.\\" Rosin uses the shift in the American economy as one of her main sources. Here, jobs which traditionally held male-led jobs are now lost in the face of the recession and recovery of said economy. Rosin also cites rising college graduation rates, steady employment, and an increased presence in male-dominated fields such as politics and business. Rosin's analysis of the shift in gender roles within American society lead to questioning the validity of this shift. She states that women find themselves confident and capable in their new roles. She also claims that their presence may be a key to shifting the culture of the workplace as their presence there becomes more established and widespread. Reception Carol Tavris writes in the Wall Street Journal that \\"[Rosin] avoids the journalistic habit of doing 'spotlight interviews' with individuals selected to support the writer's hypothesis, a practice she knows is misleading. Instead, her argument is based on substance and scholarship\\". Annalee Newitz of NPR describes the book as \\"a frustrating blend of genuine insight and breezy, unconvincing anecdotalism\\" but also that \\"the book manages to register a cultural shift in the process of happening, which is an exceedingly difficult task\\". Writing in The New York Times, Jennifer Homans suggests that The End of Men minimizes important issues still facing women, and that Rosin perpetuates stereotypes about what it means to be a woman such as having a greater ability than men to \\"sit still and focus\\".

It is generally built to represent the spiritual connection between the tribe and their ancestors and thus each poupou is carved with emblems of the tohunga whakairo‚Äôs (carver's) particular lineage. The poupou may also be decorated with representations of the tribe's ancestral history, legends and migration stories to New Zealand. As such each wharenui, and by extension the poupou, are thus treated with the utmost respect, as if it were an ancestor.  Tohunga whakairo (carver)  For MƒÅori the ability to carve wooden crafts is both a spiritual and intellectual endeavour. The tohunga whakairo had to be well versed in his tribal lineage and history to carve something that was commemorative of his ancestors. At the same time particularly amongst the traditionalists, he had to be cognizant of the proper protocols. For example, in traditional times, the tohunga whakairo never blew the shavings of his work or the ancestors would curse the piece. In other instances, if he allowed women or food near his work the mana (spiritual power) would be destroyed. In the contemporary period MƒÅori carvers have struggled to maintain the same traditional protocol in a state that has become increasingly Westernised. As a result, today, many MƒÅori have made an attempt to resurge traditional patterns and carvings within mainstream art through programs like the MƒÅori Arts and Crafts Institute. They have made it their mission to preserve traditional toi whakairo, and have opened various programs and classes to pass their traditions to younger generations.  Styles  According to Sidney Mead‚Äôs The Art of Carving, there are three classical styles typically used in MƒÅori carvings: = Taranaki = * Vigorous serpentine figures * Pointed heads * Rigged bodies * Small mouths = North Auckland = * Simplicity * Clean lines * Round heads * Use of unaunahi (half moon) * Claw like fingers = Hauraki = * Emphasis on human figure * Rigged body * Use of many figures of differing sizes-largest in the centre  The poupou at the Royal Ontario Museum  The poupou at the Royal Ontario Museum was made in the nineteenth century. It was built in the style of the Te Ati Awa people of the North Island of New Zealand. It has a dark brown complexion rather than the traditional black, white and red pigments. It is currently being displayed in the Oceania exhibit on the third floor of the Royal Ontario Museum. It is housed amongst various other Polynesian, Micronesian, and Australian indigenous artifacts like tapa or siapo cloths and Polynesian weaponry.

History  In 2010, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) sponsored two cloud computing‚Äìspecific conferences: IEEE CLOUD and IEEE CloudCom. With the success of the two conferences, IEEE Senior Member and IEEE Computer Society past president Steve Diamond, began urging the organization to take an active role in the development of cloud computing standards. In April 2011, with the support of the IEEE Future Directions Committee and funding from the IEEE New Initiatives Committee, IEEE Cloud Computing was launched. The initiative was designed to follow a multi-year plan and includes a focus across multiple tracks: conferences, education, publications, standards, Intercloud Testbed, web portal, marketing, and public relations.Hardiman, Nick. The IEEE's Cloud Computing Initiative: Chair Steve Diamond explains its aims, TechRepublic, August 01, 2012. As part of the initiative's launch, two new cloud computing standards development projects were approved: IEEE P2301, Draft Guide for Cloud Portability and Interoperability Profile, and IEEE P2302, Draft Standard for Intercloud Interoperability and Federation (SIIF). With a growing need for greater cloud computing interoperability and federation, IEEE Cloud Computing focused its development activities and resources behind IEEE P2302 standard.Weinman, Joe. Will Multiple Clouds Evolve Into the Intercloud?, WIRED, October 10, 2013.  Current work  IEEE Cloud Computing continues to pursue efforts to provide cloud computing standards, advancement of cloud computing technologies, and to educate users on the benefits of cloud computing. As part of this ongoing effort, it offers a variety of activities, products, and services, including the IEEE Cloud Computing portal, conferences and events, continuing education courses, publications, standards, and the IEEE Intercloud Testbed platform for testing cloud computing interoperability. = IEEE Cloud Computing web portal = The IEEE Cloud Computing portal serves as an online hub for cloud computing resources. The site includes news and information in the form of IEEE press releases, as well as articles taken from both IEEE and third-party publications. The portal provides dedicated sections for conferences and events, education and careers, publications, standards, the IEEE Intercloud Testbed, and other innovations. = Standards = As part of its mandate, IEEE Cloud Computing is in the process of developing global cloud computing standards. In April 2011, it began working on the first IEEE cloud computing standards, IEEE P2301 and IEEE P2302. Both IEEE P2301, Draft Guide for Cloud Portability and Interoperability Profile, and IEEE P2302, Draft Standard for Intercloud Interoperability and Federation address cloud interoperability, portability, and fragmentation.Rickn√§s, Mikael. IEEE aims to drive cloud computing standards, InfoWorld, April 04, 2011. The IEEE P2301 Guide for Cloud Portability and Interoperability Profiles (CPIP) Working Group was formed on February 24, 2014, with a mandate to develop the Guide for Cloud Portability and Interoperability Profiles. When completed, the guide will advise cloud computing ecosystem participants such as cloud vendors, service providers, and end users about available standards-based choices in areas like application, portability, management, and interoperability interfaces; file formats; and operation conventions. The guide will group these choices into multiple logical profiles, organized to address different cloud personalities. John Messina, senior member of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cloud computing program, is the Chair of the IEEE P2301 Guide for Cloud Portability and Interoperability Profiles Working Group.Babcock, Charles. IEEE Targets Cloud Interoperability Standards, InformationWeek, April 05, 2011. On April 4, 2011, the IEEE P2302 Draft Standard for Intercloud Interoperability and Federation Working Group was formed. When finalized and approved, IEEE P2302 will define topology, protocols, functionality, and governance for cloud-to-cloud interoperability and federated operations IEEE Cloud Computing also formed its new IEEE Adaptive Management for Cloud Computing (AMCC) Study Group on December 16, 2013. The group's purpose is to investigate the management environments needed to support the dynamic nature of cloud computing environments, the services they provide, the customers that consume the services and the providers offering the services. It will also explore potential application for adaptive, policy-based management in cloud based environments, including adaptive management architectures and environments; adaptive security management; auto-generation of management policies from business specifications; auto-generation of data in support of management functionality; and co-generation of application and management functionality. Joel Fleck, senior standards architect at HP Labs is the study group's chair. = Conferences = IEEE Cloud Computing both sponsors and participates in cloud computing-focused conferences and events around the world. Designed to promote knowledge-sharing about cloud computing, events typically range from one day to a week or more and attract a global audience. Conference and event programs generally offer multiple educational tracks with keynote speeches, panel discussions, and roundtables led by industry notables, researchers, engineers, academics, policymakers, and other key stakeholders. In early January 2012, IEEE Cloud Computing began partnering with established conference to develop a matrix of events targeted to specific geographic regions. IEEE GLOBECOM 2013, held in Atlanta, Georgia, was co-located with the North America Cloud Congress. The initiative is organizing additional Cloud Congresses in the European, Asia Pacific, and Latin America regions to encourage greater focus on cloud computing via existing, well-established conference such as IEEE Signature Conference on Computers, Software, and Applications (COMPSAC), IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science (IEEE CloudCom), and IEEE Global Communications Conference, Exhibition, and Industry Forum (GLOBECOM), or to create new cloud computing-related events in specific geographic regions.

The land is currently owned and used by the National Archives and Records Administration to store \\"ongoing federal records and Alaska records dating back to its purchase in 1867.\\" The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The records available at the archives include \\"textual documents, architectural drawings, maps, photographs and microfilm\\" and had not been cataloged. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The bill would direct the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA), on behalf of the Archivist of the United States, to convey to the City of Anchorage, Alaska, property in such city consisting of approximately nine acres and improvements located at 400 East Fortieth Street for not less than fair market value. The bill would make the net proceeds from such conveyance available to the Archivist to fund repairs and restorations conducted by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on March 13, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3786 would authorize the General Services Administration, on behalf of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to sell certain property in Anchorage, Alaska, for fair market value. Proceeds from the sale would be available to be spent by NARA, subject to future appropriation. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting this legislation would have no significant effect on the federal budget because we expect that the conveyance of this property will occur under current law. Based on information from NARA, we expect that the property will be sold over the next ten years because the agency has recently announced plans to close its operating facilities in Alaska. Because this legislation would accelerate the process of selling the property, the collection of sale proceeds (which are offsetting receipts, an offset to direct spending) also would be accelerated. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, CBO estimates the effect on offsetting receipts over the 2014-2024 period would be negligible. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues. H.R. 3786 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history H.R. 3786 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on December 16, 2014 by Rep. Don Young (R, AK-0). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management. It was reported (amended) by the Committee on Transportation on April 9, 2014 alongside House Report 113-407. The House was scheduled to vote on the bill under a suspension of the rules on June 17, 2014. Debate and discussion One opponent of the bill focused primarily on his opposition to the NARA closing its only facility in Alaska, arguing that \\"it is disrespectful of Alaska to attempt to balance the NARA budget by closing the Alaska National Archives facility and selling off the permanent site.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3786 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3786 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3786 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3786 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3786 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 3786 *House Report 113-407 on H.R. 3786 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"H.R. 3786 (113th Congress)"},{"id":"43019652","text":"Wee Kirk o' the Heather may refer to: * Wee Kirk o' the Heather (Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale) * Wee Kirk o' the Heather (Las Vegas) ","title":"Wee Kirk o' the Heather"},{"id":"43019672","text":"Twenty teams entered the competition, two teams were successful in qualifying for the Olympics.

It is approximately long. It is entirely in Locust Township. Its watershed has an area of 5.97 square miles. It is designated as a coldwater fishery and Class A Wild Trout Waters. Brown trout inhabit it, as to 14 other fish species. Numerous species of macroinvertebrate also inhabit the stream. Course Lick Run in its lower reaches Lick Run starts in southern Locust Township north of a mountain. It flows northeast into central Locust Township and then turns north for a short distance. The stream then turns northeast, passing the community of Newlin, and then gradually turns north again. Shortly downstream, it enters Roaring Creek some distance southeast of Slabtown. Lick Run joins Roaring Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology, geography, and geology In a visual assessment on a scale of 0 to 28 (with a higher number indicating higher quality), Lick Run scored 16.5 at Poorhouse Road. At Mill Road, near its mouth, the stream scored 20.5. Lick Run experiences siltation in its lower reaches. upstream of its mouth, the water temperature of Lick Run was observed to be on July 31, 2003. At its mouth, the temperature was on the same day. Lick Run is long and wide. Its elevation decreases at a rate of per kilometer. The stream has an elevation of about sea level at its mouth. Watershed Lick Run is in the Catawissa, Mount Carmel, and Ashland United States Geological Survey quadrangles. The stream's watershed has an area of 5.97 square miles. 56 percent of Lick Run is within of a road and 97 percent is within of a road. All of the stream's length is within of a road. None of the stream is public, but 70 percent of it is private and open. The remaining 30 percent is private and closed. The population density of the watershed of Lick Run was 30 people per square kilometer in 2000. Fish Lick Run is designated as a coldwater fishery. The Roaring Creek Watershed Coldwater Conservation Plan has suggested that it be promoted to high-quality coldwater fishery status. It has also been a Class A Wild Trout Water for brown trout. The stream was stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission until 1982. Fifteen species of fish, including brown trout, bass, sculpin, chub, suckers, and minnows, inhabit Lick Run. Ten are present in the stream's middle reaches and fourteen are present at its mouth. The population of brown trout in the stream is per hectare. The biomass of these fish has remained mostly constant since 1976, except in 1982 when there were only per hectare. There are 64 brown trout longer than per kilometer of the stream and an estimated 451 between and long in the entire stream. Macroinvertebrates Near Poorhouse Road on Lick Run, the macroinvertebrates Isonychiidae and Hydropsychidae are common, with 10 to 25 individuals of each being observed during a biological survey here. The macroinvertebrates Cambaridae, Ephemerellidae, Peltoperlidae, Nigronia, Philoptamidae, and Rhyacophilidae are less common, with a biological survey observing 3 to 9 individuals of each. The taxa Oligochaeta, Oligochaeta, Turbellaria, Baetidae, Perlidae, and Ptilodactylidae are rare, with fewer than three individuals of each taxon being observed during a biological survey here.

A con artist and serial bigamist who has been married 11 times to nine different men since 1961, Coit was convicted of killing her eighth husband in 1993 and is also suspected of killing her third husband in 1972. Coit is serving a life sentence with no possibility of parole at the Denver Women's Correctional Facility. Biography Coit was born Jill Lonita Billiot in Lafayette, Louisiana. She is of Native American descent. Her upbringing was apparently normal and without any major trauma or unusual features, and she was described as popular at her school. However, Coit did not fare well academically and dropped out of high school in 1961 to marry her first husband. Less than a year later she filed for divorce and liquidated their shared bank accounts. She married for a second time, to Steven Moore, and gave birth to a son in 1964, filing for divorce soon afterwards. =William Clark Coit, Jr.= Coit married engineer William Clark Coit, Jr. in January 1966, while still legally married to Moore. The couple had two children, William Andrew Coit (called Andrew) and William Coit III. William Coit, Jr. adopted Jill's son from her previous marriage. William Coit, Jr. was killed on March 29, 1972, shot twice in the back by an apparent intruder shortly after he filed for divorce from Jill. She was suspected of the murder, but the police could never find sufficient evidence to charge her. Additionally, she checked herself into a mental hospital to avoid further questioning. Shortly after Clark's death, Jill Coit moved to California, where she also persuaded an elderly gentleman to informally adopt her, and subsequently inherited \\"a large portion of his estate\\" after his death. =Additional marriages= Coit's fourth marriage was to Donald Charles Brodie, an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. The couple divorced in 1975 after two years of marriage. Coit later twice married and twice divorced one of the lawyers who represented her during the investigation into William Coit's murder. While separated from her fifth husband, Coit married Eldon Duane Metzger in Ohio. In 1983, she married husband number seven, a schoolteacher in Indiana. =Gerald Boggs= While renovating a bed and breakfast with her sons, Coit regularly visited Gerald Boggs' hardware store in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. They struck up a relationship and in 1991 Boggs, a 52-year- old bachelor, married her, becoming (unbeknown to him) her eighth husband. Boggs' brother Doug was concerned by Coit's excessive interest in her husband's finances. He hired a private investigator who exposed Coit as a complete fraud. She had been married nine times, had several aliases, had been involved in various financial and insurance scams, and was still legally married to her seventh husband. She had also faked a pregnancy, having had a hysterectomy. On the basis of this information, Boggs annulled the marriage after seven months. After the annulment, Coit and Boggs were involved in an acrimonious lawsuit over the bed and breakfast business. Boggs had a substantial financial interest in the establishment that was complicated by her use of mortgage fraud, apparently to conceal her assets due to a financial judgment against her by yet another previous husband. The murder of Boggs happened shortly before the trial was scheduled to begin.People v. Coit, Colorado Court of Appeals, Div. II., 961 P.2d 524 (1997) Coit briefly married for a ninth time before entering into a relationship with Michael Backus, and convinced him to help her murder Boggs. In October 1993, they acted on their plot. Wearing a disguise which included a false mustache, Coit and Backus broke into Boggs's home. They shocked him with a stun gun, and ultimately murdered him using a .22 caliber pistol. Police quickly centered on Coit as a suspect. After she confided to her younger son about the murder and asked for his help in covering it up, he instead went to the police. She was arrested in December 1993. Subsequent investigation, as well as testimony at her 1995 trial, revealed that she began making plans to murder Boggs as early as the summer of 1993, going as far as to solicit several people to come to Colorado and kill him. She was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and sentenced to life without possibility of parole plus an additional 47 years on the conspiracy charge. Coit, Colorado Department of Corrections #86530, is currently serving her sentence at Denver Womens Correctional Facility. All of her appeals have been exhausted. She has repeatedly attempted to find a new husband via the internet. In media =Books= * The 1995 book Charmed to Death, by author Stephen Singular tells the story of Jill Coit's conviction for killing her husband, Gerry Boggs, and depicts her long history of bigamy and embezzlement. * The 1995 book Poisoned Vows, by investigative journalist and true crime author Clifford L. Linedecker, is a biography of Coit and her criminal activities. =Television= Coit was portrayed by Bonnie Bedelia in the Fox made-for- television film Legacy of Sin: The William Coit Story (1995). Coit's story is told from the point of view of her son William Coit III (played by Neil Patrick Harris). The movie is based on the Stephen Singular book Charmed to Death.

Appointed to Ifriqiya in 797, he was the last Provincial governor of that province prior to the establishment of the Aghlabid Governor dynasty in 800.  Career  The son of Muqatil ibn Hakim al-Akki, a supporter of the Abbasid Revolution, Muhammad himself was a foster brother of the caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786‚Äì809). In 797 Harun appointed him to Ifriqiya, as a replacement for Harthamah ibn A'yan. Arriving at the provincial capital al- Qayrawan in late October or early November, his administration quickly ran into problems due to his bad conduct, and his relations with the jund (local army) soon became strained. Eventually a rebellion led by Makhlad ibn Murrah al-Azdi and supported by members of the jund and the local Berbers broke out, but Muhammad dispatched an army which defeated the rebels and killed Makhlad. In October 799 a new revolt led by Tammam ibn Tamim al-Tamimi was launched in Tunis and quickly gathered a large degree of support. As the rebels marched toward al-Qayrawan, Muhammad went out to meet them, but he was defeated and forced to retreat back into the city. Tammam, however, continued his advance and entered al-Qayrawan. Muhammad was given a guarantee of safety by the rebels on the condition that he departed from Ifriqiya; accepting the arrangement, he departed and made his way to Tripoli. Shortly after his exile, Muhammad received a letter from Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab, the governor of the Zab, informing him that he had expelled Tammam from al-Qayrawan and inviting him to return to the province; Muhammad consequently was able to resume his governorship. A fresh attempt was soon made by Tammam, who had fled to Tunis, to overthrow Muhammad, but Ibrahim defeated him again and gained his submission. Muhammad's restored rule over Ifriqiya did not last for long. His continuing unpopularity among his subjects led to Ibrahim writing to Harun al- Rashid, telling him of the hatred for Muhammad and asking to be appointed over Ifriqiya in exchange for certain financial guarantees. Harun granted this request; Muhammad was dismissed and Ibrahim became the first governor of the Aghlabid dynasty.

It is a large modernist residence (also let as luxury holiday accommodation) which opened in 2004 in place of Old Corrour Lodge, which had been destroyed by fire in 1942. The previous lodge had been built in 1896 for John Stirling-Maxwell when he purchased the estate. Earlier still a building now referred to as Corrour Old Lodge had been the estate house and was some three miles to the south. The location is very remote - the entrance drive from the nearest public road is eleven miles long. However Corrour railway station is only about four miles away. Corrour Estate The Estate, south of Loch Ossian The vast Loch Treig Estates, of which Corrour was a part, were owned by the Macdonalds of Keppoch from the 14th century. In 1834 the Duke of Gordon sold the estates to John Walker of Crawfordton, who died in 1857, for ¬£45,000. There was only of arable land. An 1842 account of Kilmonivaig parish, stated that \\"Perhaps there is no part of the Highlands where nature has done more, and landlords so little, for the benefits of the inhabitants as some parts of the parish\\". Sir George Gustavus Walker inherited the estate in 1857 at a time when field sports were becoming more popular in the Scottish Highlands following a relaxation in the law. Walker converted Corrour Old Lodge to a shooting lodge but, despite the lodge's inaccessibility, the deer forest was relatively restricted at in 1883. However, with a decline in sheep farming, the deer forest was extended to by 1891 and grouse shooting and trout fishing were developed. Stirling-Maxwell purchased the estate at this time and built a new lodge, the one now called Old Corrour Lodge, on a south-facing slope and at a lower elevation on the eastern shore of Loch Ossian. He undertook forestry planting, in particular attempting upland plantations. As well as planting Scots pine, he experimented with lodgepole pine, European and Japanese larch, and Sitka spruce, the last of which was a particular success. His influential work led to Stirling- Maxwell becoming chairman of the Forestry Commission from 1929 to 1932. World War II led to financial difficulty and most of the land was sold to the Forestry Commission in 1966 with sporting rights retained by the family. The Forestry Commission constructed an access track from the north east in 1972. Following a change in the law in 1981, the family bought back the land. In 1995 the estate was sold to Corrour Estate Company Ltd of which the beneficial owner was Lisbet Rausing. By 2003, after a number of company transfers, 99% was transferred to the Corrour Trust, whose trustees are Lisbet Rausing and Richard Oldfield. In 2011 the Estate extended to .. Corrour Old Lodge Corrour Old Lodge George Gustavus Walker renovated Corrour Old Lodge () converting it to a shooting lodge, which at was reputed to be the highest house in Scotland and one of the most inaccessible shooting lodges. It was beside the historical drove road, the Road to the Isles. in size, it was set in Choire Odhair on the southwest flank of C√†rn Dearg, south of Loch Ossian. Now in a ruinous state after its roof had been deliberately removed in the 1930s, it was reputed to have been used as a sanatorium (isolation hospital) in the early 20th century. Old Corrour Lodge The next Corrour Lodge (), now called Old Corrour Lodge, was built in 1896 on the shore of Loch Ossian. The architect was Frank College of Wharrie and College, Glasgow and the garden, created in about 1904, was designed by L. and J. Falconer who made structural changes to the lodge at the same time. Originally, access was by the old drovers' Road to the Isles from Rannoch, but in 1894 the West Highland Line was opened across the estate. Stirling-Maxwell had agreed to the development on the proviso that Corrour railway station was built. He had a track built for pony and trap to travel the one mile () to Loch Ossian and constructed a boat house for his steam yacht Cailleach to sail the three-mile () length of the loch to a jetty beside the lodge. In 1910 a drive was constructed along the south shore of the loch so visitors could have their cars transported by train and could then motor to their destination. The boat house is now the SYHA Loch Ossian Youth Hostel. Garden at Corrour Lodge, 1908 The Stirling-Maxwells created a considerable garden - a sub-alpine garden, a wild garden beside the loch, a rhododendron garden a mile away on the south shore. Stirling-Maxwell used seeds and plants from the plant expeditions he sponsored to Himalaya, China and Frank Kingdon-Ward's expedition to Assam in 1935. Mountain pine and rhododendrons provided shelter. The lodge was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1942 and Stirling-Maxwell wrote \\"the new house should be the sort of thing that William Adam might have built for Lord Huntly, then owner of Corrour ...\\". Instead it was replaced by a temporary wooden bungalow which remained until 1999. 21st-century Corrour Lodge The new lodge, also showing part of the Edwardian structure. Lily pond beside terrace and loch Corrour Lodge () was rebuilt during 1999 to 2003 on the same site as the previous lodge. The entrance drive, which leaves the A86 near the (south western) foot of Loch Laggan, is long. The lodge has been designed in a modernist style by Moshe Safdie and has been built of Portuguese granite, steel and glass at a reported cost of ¬£20 million. The Great Hall is set between a cylindrical and a rectangular tower. Notes on the architecture and a slideshow To one side on the new building the old lodge's wings house the estate office (once the school house) and two cottages and on the other side is a detached cottage in what used to be the chapel. There is a detached timber sauna, turf-roofed and prefabricated in Norway. The gardens have mostly been unaltered since they were laid out a century earlier, but since 2003 they have been listed in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. They are of , including the alpine garden of one hectare (), and the rhodedendron garden, to the south of Loch Ossian, is . When not being used by the owners and their guests, the lodge is let as serviced holiday accommodation. There is further holiday accommodation in cottages around the estate as well as adjacent to the main lodge. In addition to being a retreat, the estate advertises itself as being available for activities such as deer stalking, fishing, walking, pony trekking and clay pigeon shooting. There have been allegations that helicopters and motor vehicles have been used unlawfully to drive deer towards people hunting. However, the estate management denies this has been done and says helicopters are only used to carry people to distant parts of the estate and to retrieve deer carcasses.

Its original members were Palmyra Delran (guitar) and Jezebel (singer/songwriter), the latter of whom was later replaced by Lexi Plumm. History The band played its first show in Philadelphia on New Year's Eve 1991/1992, and released their first single, a cover of The Troggs' \\"Come Now,\\" in 1991, before playing any live shows. This was followed by several more singles and an EP, America's Only Rock & Roll Magazine Parody. The cover of this 1994 EP, which was produced by Ben Vaughn, closely mimicked the cover of an old issue of Creem. Late that year, Jezebel left the band, whereupon she was replaced by Lexi Plumm. Delran decided to hire Plumm after she was impressed by the sound of motorcycles on her answering machine. The band released their only album, Rock Candy, in 1997 on E-Vil Records. It was also produced by Vaughn. Rock Candy received positive reviews, which led to the band opening for Beck and Cheap Trick. The band performed at SXSW in 1997 and broke up in 2000. Film appearances The Friggs' song \\"Bad Word for a Good Thing\\" appeared in both the films Jawbreaker and Fuck. Their cover of Pat Benatar's song Heartbreaker also appeared in Jawbreaker, but was left off the soundtrack.

Style The Friggs themselves have described their style as \\"trashy pop\\", and MTV News' Frank Tortorici concurred with this description. The Austin Chronicle has described the Friggs as \\"an all-female version of The Standells\\" and their music as \\"'60's-influenced trash-pop\\".

It was also one of the last tracks that featured the Kinks' longtime bassist, Pete Quaife. Release and reception Dave Davies said in an interview prior to the song's release, \\"[I]f 'Hold My Hand' does click, I'll be free to do my own cabaret act if I want. I would use all new material, except maybe, a couple of the Kinks' hit records, but given a different treatment so that it suited a solo voice. Probably work with a small group. I'd love to have a go at this sort of act, but you know how things get talked about, then flop off.\\" The single did indeed flop, receiving scant promotion from PYE and only modest airplay, not helped that the off-shore pirate radio stations had been taken off air by then. After the disappointment of its predecessor, \\"Lincoln County\\", the Kinks management still thought a Dave Davies solo career was viable. Therefore \\"Hold My Hand\\" was released in 1969 as a standalone single, backed with \\"Creeping Jean\\" (which, although it wasn't released on any Kinks albums, it has been a live favourite of Dave Davies' since he started performing solo in the late '90s.) Hold my Hand. did not chart in any country, even in European countries such as Germany and Holland where Kinks sales had historically held up. \\"Hold my Hand\\" would have likely appeared on any Dave Davies solo album had it appeared in the second half of the 1960s, but an album was never released. It however has since appeared on numerous compilations including The Album That Never Was and the reissues of Arthur from 1997 onwards. Most notably it appeared on 2011's \\"Hidden Treasures\\" in remastered stereo and demo form, this album finally brought the whole tortured saga of the lost 1960s Dave Davies solo album into full public gaze. Dave Davies put his solo career on hold, not releasing any new material non-related to the Kinks until 1980. Writer Andy Miller named the \\"Hold My Hand\\" single \\"fabulous.\\" References Category:1969 singles Category:The Kinks songs Category:Songs written by Dave Davies Category:Pye Records singles Category:1969 songs ","title":"Hold My Hand (Dave Davies song)"},{"id":"43020051","text":"Luciano Lamonarca (born 11 August 1978) is an Italian opera singer, crossover artist, keynote speaker, philanthropist, and event producer.

Having performed in more than 200 benefit events from 2008 to 2018, his involvement in numerous charitable causes, and his commitment to making art with a purpose have earned Luciano Lamonarca the sobriquit \\"The Goodwill Tenor.\\" Personal life and education Luciano Lamonarca was born in Milan, as the second and youngest son of Pasquale Lamonarca and Anna De Nicolo. His family later moved to Ruvo di Puglia in the southern Province of Bari where he began his musical education. Originally trained as a clarinetist, at age 18 he became devoted to opera after hearing a recording of Mario Del Monaco‚Äôs rendition of Un Amore Cos√¨ Grande. From 1998 to 2008, he participated in several master classes conducted by Salvatore Fisichella, Roberto Scandiuzzi and Daniele Barioni, and he studied with Gino Lo Risso-Toma, Carmen Sensaud, and Ignazio Campisi. In 2008, he moved to the United States. Artistic accomplishments In 2008, he appeared twice in April. The first performance was at New York's Madison Square Garden for the opening of the worldwide premiere of the movie Carnera: The Walking Mountain. Among the honored guests at that occasion were the American Actor Burt Young and the Academy Award Winner F. Murray Abraham. Only a few days later, he performed again as a European representative in a concert held at the United Nations General Assembly where he sang before an audience of ambassadors; delegations; the President of the 62nd Session of the General Assembly, H.E. Srgian Kerim; and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Later in that same year, he performed with I Solisti del Teatro Regio di Parma at the Public Service Awards Ceremony, organized by the Department of Public Administration of the United Nations. In March 2009, he performed in a concert, titled \\"Mamma,\\" at New York's Merkin Concert Hall. Then in 2010 he performed at New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts for a concert in honor of tenor Giovanni Consiglio and again in December when he sang at Carnegie Hall in a concert-tribute to the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations. In 2011 at the Tenth Anniversary of the Attack on the Twin Towers in Westchester County (New York), his featured performance was broadcast by News 12. In November of the same year, he was again the featured performer at \\"United Academia,\\" a concert celebrating the first anniversary of United Nations Academic Impact. In 2013, he returned to Merkin Concert Hall as a special performing guest of the United Nations Symphony Orchestra. In May, he performed for the first time in Chisinau, Moldova, at the prestigious Sala Cu Orga in a benefit concert, titled Sing for You, in support of the Regina Pacis Foundation. From 2014 to 2017, he invested his energy and time in performing in multiple concerts and events in support of the Saint Pio Foundation. On December 7, 2018, he returned to Carnegie Hall where he performed with the Four Phantoms (Brent Barrett, Ciar√°n Sheehan, Franc D'Ambrosio, and Marcus Lovett). Albums and digital projects In March 2009 Luciano Lamonarca released his first album, titled Mamma, dedicated to his mother and launched in a concert at Merkin Concert Hall in New York. In January 2012, he released his second album The Impossible Dream, a compilation of Italian operatic arias and American pop-operatic hits, made in partnership with the New York Choral Society. In October of the same year and with the approval of stage director Giancarlo Del Monaco, he produced the online music project Ricordano Mario Del Monaco as a tribute to the legendary tenor Mario Del Monaco.. In May 2018, he recorded the single God Bless America in partnership with the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of its composition by Irving Berlin. Later that year in October, he recorded the single Volare on the 60th anniversary of its composition by Domenico Modugno. Media credits Luciano Lamonarca has been interviewed and featured in numerous articles and television interviews by The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, New York Daily News, New York Post, Fox News, NBC, CBS, News 12, RAI Uno, RAI Tre, RAI International, The Italian Times, The Italian Tribune, Italia! magazine (in Russian), La Repubblica, America Oggi, Quotidiano.Net, and Il Corriere del Mezzogiorno. Public recognition Luciano Lamonarca received a Proclamation for artistic merit from the Westchester County Executive, Hon. Robert Astorino, on October 7, 2013, and from the New York State Comptroller, Hon. Thomas DiNapoli, on October 24, 2013. Philanthropy and the sobriquet \\"The Goodwill Tenor\\" Because of his involvement in numerous charitable causes, his commitment to making art with a purpose, and having performed in more than two hundred benefit events in the span of a decade, Luciano Lamonarca was nicknamed The Goodwill Tenor. Part of the proceeds from the sales of his first album Mamma in 2009 was donated to the City of Hope in Zambia, a missionary project by Salesian Nuns to help orphan girls and victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence. A portion of the proceeds from his 2012 album The Impossible Dream was donated to the Mini Maestros Program, which enabled New York City public school students and their parents to attend New York Choral Society performances at Carnegie Hall at no cost. He initiated, organized and performed in United for Abruzzo, an artistic tour of Manhattan, Staten Island, and Pennsylvania that raised funds for the victims of the earthquake in Abruzzo in 2009. In the spring of 2011 he introduced two philanthropic projects. The first, An Evening of Italian Opera Arias, was a gift of voice for cancer patients, families, and friends and a show of support for Musculoskeletal Cancer Research at Wintergarden and for Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, at Columbia University Medical Center. The second was the Concert Luciano Lamonarca and Friends, in April 2011, at Victor Borge Hall at the Scandinavia House, benefiting the Wyckoff Heights Medical Center. Luciano Lamonarca has created and performed in numerous other artistic-philanthropic projects to benefit orphans and the poor from various communities in the United States and is a proud supporter of charity and Catholic organizations. Puglia Center of America In November 2009, moved by his passion for Apulia, his homeland, Luciano Lamonarca founded the Puglia Center of America, a premiere organization for the promotion of the Apulia region of Italy in all its aspects. The Puglia Center of America fostered the creation and exchange of cultural, tourist, and educational assets between the Apulia region of Italy and the United States. Other goals and projects included the support of global social objectives, as well as missionary and humanitarian projects aimed at fighting cancer. Through the Puglia Center of America, Luciano produced the December 2010 concert United for Peace, at Carnegie Hall, as a tribute to the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the United Nations Logistics Base located in Brindisi, Apulia. In 2012, he built working relationships with dignitaries at the highest levels, international officials, academicians, and celebrities and successfully negotiated joint declarations of cooperation between Westchester County (New York) and the Province of Bari and between the State of Connecticut and the Province of Bari. In his capacity as President of the Puglia Center of America, Mr. Lamonarca was a co-signer of those declarations of cooperation. Among other civil society projects related to the United Nations, the organization launched the project United Academia, an initiative whose goal was to create international partnerships in the academic field and to extend access and membership in United Nations Academic Impact (\\"UNAI\\"). Through this initiative, six academic institutions joined UNAI - Fordham University, Hofstra University, and the John D. Calandra Italian American Institute from the United States and University of Bari Aldo Moro, Politecnico of Bari and the University of Salento of Lecce from Italy. As the keynote speaker at the University of Bari Aldo Moro, Maestro Lamonarca, in his capacity as President of the Puglia Center of America, shared the platform with Mr. Kiyo Akasaka, Under Secretary of the United Nations Department of Public Information, at the symposium \\"On the Road to Rio - Making development sustainable.\\" Saint Pio Foundation Luciano Lamonarca is a Catholic who has lent his personal support to promoting charitable causes in the United States, Europe, and Latin America. Because of his admiration for Padre Pio and having received the saint's intercession, he founded and assumed the role of President and CEO of the Saint Pio Foundation. The Saint Pio Foundation is an American charitable organization whose mission is to promote awareness of Saint Pio and his charism nationally and internationally. It achieves its mission by working with individuals and American Catholic healthcare, education, social, religious, and cultural partner organizations that use their facilities and influence to advance the public's knowledge of the legacy and importance of Saint Pio.  Personal life  On May 2010, he married Valentina Popa, whom he met immediately after his performance at the United Nations General Assembly on April 15, 2008. Their son, Nicholas Sebastian, was named after Nicholas Nubile, whom Luciano regarded as his \\"adoptive\\" father during his first years in the United States.

Family Robert Sellar was the fourth son of Patrick Sellar (1780-1851) and Ann Craig. His father, was unpopular because he took an active part in the Highland Clearances, while employed as factor to the Duke of Sutherland. Robert's brothers were Thomas, a merchant in New Orleans, Patrick Plenderleath, a farmer in Scotland, William Young, John Alexander, a merchant who moved to England, David Plenderleath, an American merchant, and the youngest Alexander Craig Sellar, Scottish Advocate and MP. Robert's nephew Walter Carruthers Sellar, son of his brother Patrick, became a school teacher and well known humorist writer. Robert's elder brother William Young Sellar (1825-1890), an academic, married 1852, Eleanor Mary Dennistoun, daughter of wealthy Glasgow merchant Alexander Dennistoun of Golfhill (1790-1874). Life Probably influenced by his sister's marriage into the Dennistoun family, Robert joined the mercantile firm of A J Dennistoun. In 1853 Robert travelled to Melbourne in the same year as James McCulloch, both in the employment of Alexander and John Dennistoun, to manage a branch of Dennistoun Brothers and Company in Australia. The Dennistoun family were shipping and commission agents importing and exporting goods. At one time they had branches in Glasgow, London, Liverpool, France, Melbourne, New York, and New Orleans (from where cotton was exported). Companies included, * J & A Dennistoun and Company, Glasgow * Dennistoun, Cross and Company, London * Dennistoun, Wood and Company, New York * A & J Dennistoun and Company, New Orleans On 2 April 1859 Robert Sellar married Matilda Charlotte Swyer at Christ Church, St Kilda, Melbourne.the Argus newspaper, Melbourne, Monday 4 April 1859 Matilda's brother Charles Robert Swyer was a civil engineer who had emigrated from Manchester to St Kilda to build Christ Church where construction started about 1854. McCulloch Sellar and Company Closure of the Dennistoun Brothers office in Melbourne was announced in the Edinburgh Gazette.Edinburgh Gazette 1 October 1861 The transcript begins, So it was, about 1862, following closure of the Dennistoun branch, James McCulloch and Robert Sellar went into business on their own account forming McCulloch, Sellar and Company. Having learnt their trade, by working for the Dennistoun Brothers, they imported goods into the colony, operated warehouses, and exported bales of wool. The company also leased land for sheep farming from the crown. Sheep farming and the export of Merino wool was then a very profitable business. Even the famous tea clipper the Cutty Sark was at one time transporting bales of wool from Australia to England. One of the businesses they acquired was a large sheep farming station at Mount Gipps in the outback of New South Wales known as the Mount Gipps Pastoral Company. The 'Pastoral Possessions of New South Wales' published by William Hanson in 1889 records that circa 1885 the Mount Gipps Pastoral Holding (no 20) extended to at a rent of ¬£1,307 per annum. Sometime between 1883 and 1885 silver was discovered near a rocky outcrop on their property, known as the Broken Hill. In 1885 the Broken Hill Proprietary Company was formed to raise funds to mine the silver, and so it was that the town of Broken Hill was established. It appears that James McCulloch and Robert Sellar did not acquire a mining lease or benefit. The document 'Pastoral Possessions of New South Wales' suggests James McCulloch, Robert Sellar and James MacPherson also leased another pastoral holding at Illiliwa in New South Wales that extended to at a rent of ¬£1,292 per annum. A National Trust of Australia document records Robert Sellar living in 1889 at newly built Northbrook House, 1257 High Street, Malvern, Melbourne. The house was built for Donald Munro, son of James Munro, Scottish born businessman, temperance leader and politician, who established the Federal Bank and became Premier of Victoria in 1890. Robert Sellar is described as a merchant, member of the firm McCulloch, Sellar, and Co, wool and commission merchants, agents for Lancashire Fire Insurance Co, and Merchants' Marine Insurance Co, with offices in the St James buildings. The directories show Sellar in High Street, Malvern in 1890. Following the transfer of the ownership of Northbrook House to the Federal Bank of Australia in 1893, Sellar was listed in Alma Road, Caulfield. Death The death of Robert Sellar in 1900 and an account of his life was reported in the Argus newspaper.The Argus, Melbourne, Thursday 6 September 1900 Robert Sellar died at home in Malvern, Australia, a suburb of the city of Melbourne in the state of Victoria.

The game is the seventh main entry in the Yoshi series of games, the first home console title in the series since 1997's Yoshi's Story, as well as the spiritual successor to 2010's Kirby's Epic Yarn. The game was released worldwide throughout 2015. A port for the Nintendo 3DS, known as Poochy & Yoshi's Woolly World, was released worldwide in early 2017. Plot On a knitted island filled with many Yarn Yoshis of varying patterns, the evil Magikoopa Kamek turns nearly all the Yoshis into bundles of yarn for his master Baby Bowser, scattering them across different worlds. However, two Yoshis manage to avoid being transformed themselves, and they set off to pursue Kamek and rescue their woolly friends. After traveling through six different worlds, Yoshi manages to storm Baby Bowser's castle. When Yoshis reach Baby Bowser, Kamek reveals that he stole the yarn so that he could use it to grow Baby Bowser to a much larger size. After battling Baby Bowser, the Yoshis rescue their friends from Kamek and Baby Bowser. Kamek and Baby Bowser fly away, but crash land on the moon. Gameplay E3 2014 screenshot of Yoshi's Woolly World. The characters and environment are depicted as living yarn knits, a theme that continues throughout the game. Yoshi's Woolly World is a platform game in which players assume the role of Yoshi. Similar to games like Good-Feel's Kirby's Epic Yarn, the game is set in a world where the characters and environment are composed of yarn and cloth. Yoshi retains much of his moveset from the Yoshi's Island series of games, including using his tongue to swallow enemies and using his flutter jump to reach high areas. Many elements such as flowers and mystery clouds also return. However, unlike other games where swallowing enemies would produce eggs which Yoshi could then throw, Yoshi instead produces balls of yarn. These yarn balls have various uses when thrown, such as tying up enemies or filling in certain platforms and objects. Players can also gather white chicks in certain levels, which produce temporary cloud platforms when thrown. The game also supports up to two players cooperatively. With both players able to swallow and throw their partners, allowing them to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. In addition, some sections give Yoshi special transformations, such as a motorbike or umbrella. Throughout each level, Yoshi can pick up beads, which can be spent on Power Badges. These can support the player during a level, such as granting more powerful attacks, or the ability to recover when falling into bottomless pits. Each level contains five Flowers, five Wonder Wools, and twenty Stamp Patches, which are hidden behind certain beads. Flowers increase the odds of entering a bonus game at the end of the level, and collecting all Flowers within a world opens up a secret level. Finding all the Yarn Bundles within a level unlocks a new pattern of Yoshi, which players can switch to while on the overworld map. Collecting enough Stamp Patches unlocks special stamps that can be used in Miiverse posts. At any point in the game, players can toggle between Classic Mode and Mellow Mode, the latter of which gives Yoshi a pair of wings, allowing less skilled players to fly indefinitely through a stage. The game features compatibility with Amiibo figures, including a unique knitted Yarn Yoshi Amiibo. Using any Yoshi Amiibo allows players to create a duplicate Yoshi during Solo Play, allowing solo players to replicate actions otherwise only available in Co-op Play. Additionally, the Yarn Yoshi Amiibo can be used to save a design based on another character. Other compatible figures, such as Mario and Donkey Kong, can be used to unlock additional patterns based on the respective character. The game is playable with the Wii U GamePad, Wii Remote, Wii Classic Controller, and Wii U Pro Controller. Development Yoshi's Woolly World was first announced by Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata on January 23, 2013 under the tentative title Yarn Yoshi. The game was stated to be in development by Good-Feel with game designer Takashi Tezuka supervising the project. The game was absent from E3 2013, but was playable at E3 2014, where it was given a tentative release time frame of \\"the first half of 2015.\\" The soundtrack was handled by Good-Feel composers Tomoya Tomita (now freelance) and Misaki Asada, with the exception of the main theme, which was written by Nintendo's Kazumi Totaka. Release Special editions of the game's retail release bundle the game with the knitted Yarn Yoshi Amiibo, which is available in one of three colors; green, blue, and pink. Bundles included the game with a single Yarn Yoshi Amiibo, or all three. Players who purchased the game on the European Nintendo eShop before July 23, 2015 received a free download code for a Virtual Console version of the Nintendo DS title Yoshi Touch & Go. Reception Yoshi's Woolly World received generally positive reviews, receiving an aggregated score of 78/100 on Metacritic based on 83 reviews. GameSpot's Rob Crossley gave the game a score of 6/10, saying \\"Some would say that gives Woolly World its inherent accessibility, in that players aren't forced to take the hard road. But if you want to be fully entertained, the hard road is the only real option. It is your own degree of curiosity, and your compulsive nature, that will determine which route you'll take.\\" IGN's Daniel Krupa gave the game a moderately positive review, saying \\"It's incredibly familiar, but the imaginative and attractive art style makes it feel fresh and appealing. Outside of those great few levels, Woolly World is a more forgettable and fragmented experience. Cool mechanics are cooked up, but they're dropped into levels which never realise their full potential and fixate more on unearthing frustrating collectibles.\\" Nintendo Life's Thomas Whitehead stated that the game featured \\"some of Nintendo's best co-op platforming\\" with \\"clever, witty stage design\\" and \\"gorgeous\\" visuals, but found that boss fights were \\"repetitive and disappointing\\". The 3DS version received similarly positive reception, also receiving an aggregated score of 77/100 on Metacritic, based on 56 reviews. Reviewers applauded the port for being a successful transition of the original game to a handheld, though some complaints were raised over the visual downgrade and lack of local multiplayer, with Whitehead describing it as \\"certainly a pity if not entirely surprising\\". =Sales= Yoshi's Woolly World launched in Japan with roughly 31,000 physical copies sold, and after two weeks, 43,000 copies were sold. In the UK, it entered the charts in fourth place. As of March 31, 2016, the game had worldwide sales of 1.37 million copies. The Nintendo 3DS version of the game sold 80 percent of its initial shipment in Japan, but only entered the UK charts in twentieth place. =Legacy= A stage based on the then-unreleased Yoshi's Woolly World appeared in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. An upbeat remix of the music from the game's trailers is also present.

It is the sixth installment in the Star Fox series, and the second reboot in the series following Star Fox 64. After a delay from November 2015, the game was released in April 2016 and received mixed to positive reception. A standalone tower defense game, titled Star Fox Guard, was bundled with the game. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot from E3 2015 Star Fox Zero largely follows the gameplay of its predecessors, predominantly Star Fox 64, in which players control Fox McCloud as he pilots his Arwing craft through various levels. The game is controlled using the Wii U GamePad, with the left control stick used to maneuver the craft while gyroscopic controls can be used to aim weapons. A cockpit view is displayed on the second screen to assist with aiming. Some of the game's vehicles can transform in certain situations. For example, the Arwing can transform into the Walker which originated in the Super NES game Star Fox 2, which lets the player freely walk around on platforms and in enclosed spaces. The Landmaster tank can transform into the Gravmaster, which can perform extended aerial maneuvers for a short time. A new vehicle introduced to the series is the Gyrowing, a dronelike helicopter which can lower a small robot called Direct-i that can enter small spaces, hack into computers, or latch onto explosive cubes that can then be dropped on enemies. Players can also add laser upgrades and smart bombs to their ships. Special techniques, such as charge shot, barrel roll, Somersaults, U-Turns and rapid turn, can be performed. Two gameplay modes are featured in the game. The Scroll Mode puts the player in a predetermined path, while the All-Range Mode allows the player to move freely in a mission. If players lose all their ships in a mission, they must restart the entire mission in order to proceed. Various elements return from previous games, including Fox's teammates, Falco, Peppy, and Slippy, who can assist the player if they protect them from enemy attacks, as well as Star Wolf team rivals Wolf O'Donnell, Leon Powalski, Pigma Dengar, and Andrew Oikonny. Several level locations have also returned, including Corneria, Zoness, and Titania, while two new locations, Sector Alpha and Area 3, have been added. Players can scan the Fox and Falco Amiibo figurines to unlock the Retro Arwing, which is based on the model used in the original Star Fox game, and the Black Arwing, which sports a black and red color scheme, is stronger and faster, but takes more damage, respectively. Development Lead Star Fox Zero producer Shigeru Miyamoto demonstrates the game behind closed doors at E3 2014. The game was one of three projects he demonstrated at E3. The game's development began with experimentation on leftover assets from a never-released Star Fox game for the Wii that had been worked on by a small group since about 2008. The game's existence was confirmed in a press sheet on June 8, 2014, two days before E3 2014 began. On June 10, 2014 during the Electronic Entertainment Expo, Time leaked information about the game in the morning, then Nintendo announced the title publicly, and Nintendo's E3 digital briefing video again hinted at its further details later in the day. Later during an interview with Wired, Miyamoto expressed his desire to work with external developers for faster completion of the project. In an interview with GameSpot, Miyamoto revealed that both Project Guard and Project Giant Robot were connected to Star Fox for Wii U in some fashion. During a Nintendo Direct presentation on March 3, 2016, Project Guard was renamed as Star Fox Guard, and bundled both digitally and as a physical copy alongside Star Fox Zero. Project Giant Robot was never released, and was cancelled in 2017. Miyamoto stated that the game's main storyline and overall presentation would be structured episodically, taking inspiration from the 1960s television series Thunderbirds, with the main missions featuring traditional Star Fox gameplay acting as \\"primetime programming\\", while side- missions featuring more quirky, experimental gameplay mechanics (such as those found in Project Guard and Project Giant Robot) act as \\"late-night programming\\". Yusuke Hashimoto of PlatinumGames stated they were approached by Nintendo about co-developing the game after requesting to add an Arwing-themed bonus level to Bayonetta 2. Hideki Kamiya of PlatinumGames had also previously expressed his desire for Nintendo to approach them about developing a new Star Fox game. According to Nintendo, the story of Zero is neither a prequel or a sequel to previous Star Fox games. In December 2014, Miyamoto stated that Star Fox Zero would be released before the new installment of The Legend of Zelda series in 2016. He also confirmed that the game would be compatible with Amiibo, but did not specify in what way. On January 5, 2015, he confirmed that Star Fox would be playable at E3 2015, and reiterated of the GamePad/monitor gameplay method, which would \\"allow for cinematic moments to blend with continuous gameplay.\\" On August 24, the release date was announced by Nintendo for November 20, 2015, but the game was subsequently delayed to the first quarter of 2016. The November 2015 Nintendo Direct officially announced that the game would be released in North America and Europe on April 22, 2016, and in Australia the next day. The game's credits had a small tribute to former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, who had died during the game's development. When asked if Star Fox Zero could potentially be ported to the Nintendo Switch, Atsushi Inaba of PlatinumGames stated that they didn't know if it could happen, and also said that they haven't been approached by Nintendo about it. Promotion An animated short based on the game, titled Star Fox Zero: The Battle Begins, was released online on April 20, 2016. The short was produced by Japanese animation studio Wit Studio, with assistance from Production I.G and Nintendo. A Star Fox Zero menu theme for the 3DS was also released in Japan two days before the game's release. The 3D CGI animation work was provided by Orange. On April 1, 2016, Nintendo of America began a contest called the \\"Star Fox Zero Intergalactic Art Event\\". Entrants needed to create Star Fox Zero fan art and post it on the game's Miiverse page. The best 40 entries won Nintendo eShop credit. In July 2016, a free demo of the game was released on the Wii U eShop. The demo includes the training mode from the full game, as well as the Star Fox Zero: The Battle Begins animated short. Reception Star Fox Zero received mixed to positive reception, according to the review aggregator Metacritic. Common points of discussion include the Wii U GamePad controls, the length of the game, and the structural similarities to previous titles in the series. Jose Otero from IGN praised the levels and bosses, commenting that \\"Star Fox Zero reimagines a classic Nintendo 64 game, but mastering its awkward controls takes some time.\\" Similarly, Damien McFerran from Nintendo Life observed that \\"the first time you play through Star Fox Zero, you will inevitably curse the controls\\" before admitting that \\"with perseverance it's possible to become totally attuned to the controls\\", comparing them to Splatoon. Peter Brown of GameSpot's primary fault with the controls was that it forces the player to divide attention back and forth from the television to the Gamepad. However Brown did conclude that the \\"second run was more enjoyable than the first, and solidified my appreciation for the game\\", praising the branching paths and level design. Other reviewers, however, found the mandatory motion-based controls frustrating or actively detrimental to the experience. David Roberts of GamesRadar felt that the game was \\"constantly undermined by a slavish devotion to wrapping the core design around every feature of the Wii U's Gamepad, regardless of whether it makes sense or feels good to play\\". Arthur Gies of Polygon declined to assign a score because he found that it was too miserable to finish the game on account of its controls. Jim Sterling criticized the game's controls, and slammed Nintendo for using gimmicks in order to sell their games. Sterling felt the game was \\"Masquerading as an innovative and all-new experience, Nintendo and PlatinumGames‚Äô miserable adventure is actually a bare-bones space shooter utilizing a deliberately obtuse control scheme in order to mask the fact it‚Äôs nowhere near as interesting as it pretends to be.\\" Reviewers were also divided about the game's length and high similarity to its predecessor, Star Fox 64. Some were not bothered by it; McFerran called it \\"essentially a retread of Star Fox 64 - which, in turn, was effectively Star Fox all over again\\", but found this aspect of the game \\"reassuringly familiar\\". On the other hand, Ray Carsillo of EGM said that it \\"fails to really build on [Star Fox 64] in new and exciting ways\\". He was disappointed by the choice to \\"re-imagine an older game instead of creating a truly brand new one\\". Steve Watts of Shacknews found the alternate vehicle missions, where the game sets itself apart from earlier titles, ultimately distracted from the core Arwing gameplay. McFerran concluded that Star Fox Zero is \\"easily on-par with the excellent N64 entry from which it draws so much inspiration\\". Dan Ryckert of Giant Bomb was more critical, considering the game a relic of 2002. =Sales= The game was the highest-selling game on Amazon.com on April 19, 2016, based on its preorders, a position it held for two days. Days after its launch in Japan, both the standalone and Star Fox Guard Double Pack sold 8,135 and 17,114 units respectively, individually placing it 5th and 8th for that sales week. Sales of both combined was 25,249 units, making it the 4th best selling game that week overall. During the same time frame, it was also the sixth best selling game in the United Kingdom, the third best selling in France and the fifth in Australia. According to the NPD Group, which tracks physical sales data, Star Fox Zero was the fifth best selling video game on any platform during the month of April 2016. However, sales were not as strong as Nintendo hoped in Japan, as it was the worst selling game of the franchise in the country.

A classically trained pianist, her style has been compared to that of Feist, Adele, and Lana Del Rey. Her songs have been used in episodes of the television series Hemlock Grove, Castle, Grey's Anatomy, Bones, 90210, Pretty Little Liars, Orange Is the New Black, and The Fosters. She relocated to Los Angeles, California, from her home in Portland, Oregon. She is currently represented by record label Expunged Records. Discography *When You Dream (2010) *A Very Merry (EP, 2010) *Cardiology (2012) *River Queen (EP, 2014) *Didn't Go To The Party (2016) Discovery A fan post online that Jackson- Holman left for Portland, Oregon-based Indie-pop band Blind Pilot caught the attention of their label's president. She was soon signed to their label with no formal demo. Jackson-Holman is a lifetime student of piano and a veteran classical performer. Her mother inspired her as a teen to write her own songs. Artistry =Musical style= Sara Jackson-Holman's music fits in the Pop/Alternative music genre, and her musical style is described as slow, expansive ballads balancing against hip-hop inflected upbeat tracks, all with a slight classical tinge. Her music has been compared to that of Feist, Adele, and Lana Del Rey. However, much of her music is inspired by music by Chopin, Schumann and Bach. This is reflected in her minor, brooding tones and sense of musical structure. She adds strings and layers of warm and soulful melodies in each song. Jackson-Holman's songs are also emotion-filled and often inspired by real-life experiences. Her album When You Dream carries the common themes of love and longing, forgetting and remembering, the sky and trees, and dreams of the sea in a timeless manner. While the themes of When You Dream were intended to be universal, Jackson-Holman's album Cardiology was inspired by her own life experiences and heart. The album was conceived during a year in which Jackson-Holman's grandfather died. He had been a strong influence in her musical upbringing and his passing resulted in a difficult time for Jackson- Holman and her family. Jackson-Holman reflects on her grandfather, saying, ‚ÄúMy grandfather was a big part of my musical upbringing and his death came as a shock. When I was young he would drive three hours from Portland to Bend just to watch me play for seven minutes in my classical piano competitions, and when I had branched out into pop music, he'd come to my shows in Portland. I was in the midst of recording and needing to be creative, so the process became an outlet for my confusion and grief. His death was profoundly influential as I wrote the final songs for my album. 'Freight Train' is a song I wrote when I had no words to express my grief. 'Come By Fire', 'Can't Take My Love', and 'For Albert' (his middle name) were also all written within three weeks of his passing. ('For Albert' is derivative of the classical piece 'F√ºr Elise', a sort of homage to my background). I miss him very much, and to me, his being so much a part of my songs keeps him and his memory close to my heart.‚Äù While Cardiology primarily concerned grief and loss, River Queen centers around finding strength in vulnerability, having the will to fight, and learning to love fully and without regret. Speaking of her album River Queen, Jackson-Holman states, ‚ÄúI want this record to fill people with happiness and hope.\\" Concerts and tours Sara Jackson-Holman's first concert was on June 3, 2010 at the Woods in Sellwood, Oregon, Jackson-Holman's home state. Jackson-Holman has since performed mostly in states in the western United States, such as Washington, New Mexico, Texas, Wyoming, Montana, and California, but has also performed in states such as Kansas and Illinois as well.

Located in a rural area approximately 4 kilometers southwest of Baghdad International Airport, it served as a tactical operations center primarily for the 4th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery Regiment, Bravo Battery and the 1st Battalion, 77th Armored Regiment from 2005 until its destruction in 2007. File:OP San Juan Tower.jpgThe tower at OP San Juan, 2006 File:OP San Juan Shower.jpgMakeshift shower facility at OP San Juan File:OP San Juan Burn Pit.jpgSoldiers manning the Burn pit at OP San Juan Facilities Formerly a residence of Uday Hussein, OP San Juan consisted of an area 100 meters in diameter, fortified with Hesco barriers and concertina wire. A largely destroyed 8-car garage was used as a makeshift barracks while a tower served as an observation point for surveillance and defense. Facilities were rudimentary at best, with no running water, sewer, or sanitation services. Electricity was provided by portable generators which necessitated regular dispatches to nearby Forward Operating Bases for fuel. Waste disposal consisted of a burn pit for both trash and human waste. Missions OP San Juan was established by Multi-National Corps Baghdad (MND-B) in 2005 to provide overwatch and protection of the southern approach glide-path to the Baghdad International Airport (BIAP). This mission continued until mid 2006 when the main threat to Coalition forces became attack by Improvised Explosive Devices or crudely and often hastily placed roadside bombs. The Soldiers and Officers manning the OP transitioned into the mission of Route Clearance and human intelligence collection during the summer of 2006. At times only as few as 18 service members were tasked with maintaining the safety of the roadways and local population in nearly 17 square miles of varying terrain consisting of dense urban and sparse rural land. At this time, Additional missions included providing a quick reactionary force to assist Iraqi Police when engaged by insurgent forces and providing security for the cordon of and fortification of southern Baghdad neighborhoods. Operations at the OP were often on three shifts averaging six hours a piece. A typical day would begin with six hours of guard duty followed by six hours of \\"outside the wire\\" patrol. Soldiers would be given six hours of down time in which they were required to perform their assigned area maintenance and personal hygiene duties. After this the cycle would begin again. This cycle kept soldiers on a rolling cycle best facilitating 24-hour operations on, at best, a skeleton crew. OP San Juan was located in a largely rural area of southwest Baghdad. Troops patrolling from the outpost routinely were ambushed by insurgent attacks consisting largely of small arms fire and Improvised Explosive Device attacks, though it was not uncommon for the post to be attacked by mortars. One of the primary missions for troops based out of the OP was to maintain positive relations with the residents of Al-Salam, a neighborhood approximately 6 kilometers southeast of OP San Juan. The neighborhood was eventually overrun with and controlled by insurgents despite the soldiers efforts and is now referred to as Al-Radwaniyah. Fate The area of operations, (AO) surrounding OP San Juan grew steadily more hostile to U.S. and coalition troops throughout the latter half of 2006. After taking over the AO in October 2006, the 1-77th Armored Regiment effectively closed and abandoned the OP in January 2007.

He was the youngest child of the actors Maurice Barrymore and Georgie Drew Barrymore, and his two siblings were Lionel and Ethel; together they were known as America's \\"Royal Family\\" of actors, and John was \\"perhaps the most influential and idolized actor of his day\\", according to his biographer Martin F. Norden. After Barrymore tried to start a career in art, becoming an illustrator at the New York Evening Journal, his father tempted him to appear on stage in 1901 in A Man of the World; the theater proved more interesting than the newspaper industry, and he quickly changed professions. In 1904 he appeared in his first stage show on Broadway, where he appeared in light comedies and musicals until 1914 when he began to turn to more serious roles, starting with The Yellow Ticket and Kick In. That year he also began to work in full-length films, and appeared in nine between 1914 and 1918, all of them slapstick or farce comedies. During the 1920s film roles became more serious, and he appeared in the lead role in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920), which he followed with The Lotus Eater (1921), Sherlock Holmes (1922), Beau Brummel (1924) and The Sea Beast (1926). In between his film roles, he also took the lead in two major stage productions of Shakespeare. In 1920 he played Richard, Duke of Gloucester in Richard III; although a success, the play closed after only 31 performances when Barrymore \\"collapsed from the physical and psychological challenges of the role\\". In November 1922 he played the title character in Hamlet on Broadway for 101 performances, before touring the US until January 1924; Norden described the critics' reaction as \\"universally praising the production as the best Hamlet they had ever seen\\". After the US tour, Barrymore took the production to London, where it ran for a further 68 performances; The Manchester Guardian later described the first performance as \\"the most memorable first night for years\\". Such was the success of Hamlet, that Warner Bros. signed Barrymore to a film contract. When his time with Warner Bros. finished, he signed a contract with United Artists to make three features: The Beloved Rogue (1927), Tempest (1928) and Eternal Love (1929). When that contract ended he returned to Warner Bros. for five further films, and was then picked up by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer, where he appeared in Grand Hotel, A Bill of Divorcement and Rasputin and the Empress (all 1932). At the end of the MGM contract he became \\"a journeyman movie actor\\", in the words of Norden. In September 1940 Barrymore was invited to leave his imprint in the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theatre; instead of the traditional handprint, Barrymore left his facial profile, reflecting his nickname \\"The Great Profile\\". He was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960. Although Barrymore appeared in a number of successful films in the 1930s, including Counsellor at Law (1933) and Twentieth Century (1934), his increasing alcoholism led to memory loss and the inability to remember his lines. His problems with alcohol affected his confidence and he admitted to Helen Hayes, his co-star of Night Flight, that he had \\"completely lost [his] nerve\\" and that he \\"could never appear before an audience instead\\". In 1935 he was hospitalized after being unable to remember neither his seven lines for the film Hat, Coat, and Glove, nor his character's name. After his discharge from the hospital he enjoyed a brief career revival, although much of his film work \\"bore little distinction\\", according to Norden; the film historians Donald McCaffrey and Christopher Jacobs opine that Barrymore's \\"contribution to the art of cinematic acting began to fade\\" after the mid-1930s. Barrymore also enjoyed a fruitful career on radio, which included broadcasting six of Shakespeare's plays in a Streamlined Shakespeare series. Much of his radio work was in the 74 episodes of The Sealtest Show with Rudy Vall√©e; it was during a rehearsal for the show in May 1942 that Barrymore collapsed and was admitted to hospital, where he died on May 29.

For the past 500 years it has occupied premises in Broad Chare on the Newcastle's Quayside, from which it continues to provide a combination of professional and charitable maritime services. It remains one of only three bodies in England authorized for the examination and licensing of deep-sea pilots. Origins The 'Guild of the Blessed Trinity of Newcastle upon Tyne' emerged in the late 15th century, and was formally constituted on 4 January 1505 when it obtained an area of land close to the river on which to build a chapel, meeting room and lodgings for mariners (it was secured by the quit- rent of one red rose, payable annually to a Mr Ralph Hebborn on Midsummer's Day.) Early in its history, the corporation (as it came to be known) was given responsibility for improving the Tyne as a navigable river. For example, the first Royal Charter (received from Henry VIII in 1536) stipulated the building and fortification of a pair of towers at a certain point on the north bank, and the maintenance of lights thereon for the purposes of navigation. (These were precursors of the High and Low Lights which still stand today at North Shields). Premises 'Trinity House' is the name of the corporation's headquarters buildings by the Quayside, a site which it has occupied since the day of its foundation in 1505. Though there have been several rebuildings, some sixteenth-century (and older) fabric remains, and later 18th and 19th- century additions and restorations were sympathetic to the Tudor style of the original. A chapel, some offices, the banqueting hall and boardroom, along with the former school and several almshouse buildings, are arranged around three courtyards, described as 'the most pleasant exterior spaces' in the City. Entry is via a gateway on Broad Chare. The warehouses to the south of the gatehouse are currently leased to Live Theatre; they formerly housed a Trinity House museum. Later developments Before long, the corporation was responsible for the licensing of mariners and pilots and for 'keeping the sea lanes' between Whitby and Berwick-upon-Tweed. At the same time, the corporation was (and had been since its early years) active in charitable work, including the provision of almshouses for aged mariners and the establishment of a school on its premises. The corporation was a high profile organisation in the city, for example hosting a visit by Archduke Frederick of Austria in 1841, and presenting him with a commemorative gold snuff box. All these activities were financed principally through the levying of duties on every ship entering the Tyne to trade ‚Äì a practice which only ceased in 1861. Following the passing of the Harbour and Passing Tolls Act in that year, the corporation began to devolve some responsibilities to other bodies; in particular, a new board took on responsibility for pilotage on the Tyne, and a new commission took on maintenance of the river's channels and buoyage, together with the corporation's lights at North and South Shields. Newcastle Trinity House continued though to be responsible for buoys, marks and lights along parts of the coast until the mid-1990s. Present-day activities and governance Today, the corporation remains active in the provision of professional and charitable maritime services. In addition to its work as a deep-sea pilot authority, it also offers a broader professional maritime consultancy service. It furthermore continues to provide charitable support for 'aged mariners and their widows', as well as varied educational programmes (raising an awareness of maritime history and practice among younger generations, including in schools). It is also committed to the upkeep of its historic buildings (which are nowadays regularly used for corporate and other events) and its extensive archives.Charity Commission listing, 2014 Trinity House has been a registered charity since 1966 and is governed by a Royal Charter of 1667. Its operation is overseen by an annually elected board; principal officers include the master, deputy master and several wardens with responsibility for different areas of activity. All are master mariners, except the Secretary to the Board. Mariners who are full members of the corporation are styled 'brethren'. Others wishing to support the work of the charity may join as 'associate members'. On formal occasions, the brethren wear a naval-style uniform (similar to that worn by their counterparts in Trinity House, London). The arms of the corporation are worn as a cap-badge and are also prominent on and in the buildings of Trinity House (not just those on Broad Chare, but also structures built and owned by the corporation in former years such as North Shields High Light). Despite several similarities of nomenclature, structure and activity, Newcastle-upon-Tyne Trinity House is and always has been entirely independent of its namesake Trinity House in London. Trinity House, Kingston-Upon-Hull is similarly an independent body with past and continuing maritime responsibilities in and around the Humber, and there are also similar institutions in Scotland.

The Task Force is part of a wider federal move to bring awareness to sexual violence on American campuses, which also included the Office for Civil Rights release of a list of American higher education institutions with open Title IX sexual violence investigations and the It's On Us public awareness campaign. The co-chairs of the Task Force are Vice President Joe Biden and Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett. Background and history Biden with President Barack Obama, July 2012 Valerie Jarrett official portrait Obama speaks with Jarrett in a West Wing corridor. While formed through an official government memorandum on January 22, 2014, the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault exists as part of a lineage of government interventions against sexual violence, notably the White House Council on Women and Girls formed in 2009 and the Violence Against Women Act first drafted by Biden when he was a senator in 1994.Rape and sexual assault: A renewed call to action, White House Council on Women and Girls, Washington, DC: White House Council on Women and Girls & Office of the Vice President, January 2014, Retrieved 10 June 2014. Simultaneously, activists within The New Campus Anti-Rape Movement have pushed for legislative changes in the ways the U.S. government enforces regulations, as demonstrated in the collaborations between nationally recognized activists and U.S. senators. Data published in a 2014 government report on sexual assault in American colleges and universities reflects the numbers and backgrounds of college students who have experienced sexual assault. A report published in January 2015 by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the result of a nine-school pilot to conduct a campus study on \\"school-level data on sexual victimization of undergraduate students,\\" found that * Younger students (between 18‚Äì22 years of age) experienced sexual victimization at a rate higher than those 23 or older * Non-heterosexual students are more likely to be victimized than heterosexual students at the nine schools surveyed * On average, the rate of victimization for completed sexual assault among undergraduate females was 176 per 1,000 * On average, the rate of victimization for rape among undergraduate females was 54 per 1,000 Responsibilities The Task Force was created to protect students from sexual assault, to help improve the safety of American college and university campuses, and to help American colleges and universities to \\"meet their obligations\\" and be in compliance with federal regulations in this area. By 2016, the Task Force, in collaboration with federal agencies, produced training, messaging and guidance materials \\"concerning sexual assault in educational spaces,\\" which can be found in a public-facing Resource Guide. Members Obama specified in his official memorandum those people who are to be members of the Task Force. Those individuals include Joe Biden or his designee; Valerie Jarrett or her designee; the Attorney General; the Secretary of the Interior; the Secretary of Health and Human Services; the Secretary of Education; the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy; the Director of the Domestic Policy Council; the Cabinet Secretary; and agency or office heads as may be designated by the co-chairs. =Joe Biden= Joe Biden's goal from the campaign is to prevent sexual assault. He also strives to create less discrepancies with sexual assault, calling for a future in which a victim of sexual assault does not need to question his or her doing. Biden issued federal guidelines while presenting a speech at the University of New Hampshire. He stated that, \\"No means no, if you're drunk or you're sober. No means no if you're in bed, in a dorm or on the street. No means no even if you said yes at first and you changed your mind. No means no.\\" Biden has taken a stance on sexual assault, making speeches to students, asking them to stand against assault. Biden stated to the victim of sexual assault at Stanford University, \\"you did it... in the hope that your strength might prevent this crime from happening to someone else. Your bravery is breathtaking.\\" See also *Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims *Women's rights in 2014 References External links * Official memorandum establishing the Task Force * Valerie Jarrett's article regarding Task Force establishment Category:2014 establishments in the United States Category:United States Presidential Task Forces Sexual Assault Category:Campus sexual assault Category:Sex crimes in the United States Category:Victims' rights Category:Presidency of Barack Obama ","title":"White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault"},{"id":"43020873","text":"Tropidion abditum is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Biography Miskow was born on the island of Funen at Nyborg, Denmark. After 2 years in military school from 1871, Miskow continued his studies in violin and piano. From 1876 to 1879, was taught at the Royal Danish Academy of Music. Here he concentrated on singing lessons with Carl Helsted (1837‚Äì1893). He also trained under pianist Edmund Neupert (1842‚Äì1888) and violinist Christian Schi√∏rring (1837‚Äì1893). Between 1885-86, he received additional training in Vienna. He made his debut as a bass singer at the Danish Royal Theatre in 1880. He was never on the staff of the theater and worked since as a singing teacher and as a concert singer. At times he was also a music critic, including for Berlingske Tidende, Denmark's oldest newspaper, in the years 1903‚Äì1914, and choral conductor of the Copenhagen Workers' Choir, which he founded in 1915. Most of his musical composition are forgotten today. He is most associated with one of his first songs, Den spillemand snapped fiolen fra v√¶g, with text by Holger Drachmann (1846‚Äì1908). The song still appears in new Danish songbooks and is recorded by today's artists. Allegretto Fantasia for clarinet and piano by Miskow appears in \\"Concert and Contest\\", a widely used collection of intermediate level clarinet solos compiled and edited by Himie Voxman.

There are times when citizens, State agencies and our governmental leaders must have a collective conscience to remedy our social failings. When State agencies use an assessment tool that has never been validated on the very young to psychiatrically hospitalize three and four year-old children, shame on us. When a four-year-old comes into state custody with the developmental speech of a two-year-old, and we only afford him 15 minutes of speech therapy once a week, shame on us. When a ward is gunned down in the streets by an officer whose duty is to protect and there is no integrity to those reporting the incident, shame on us as a society. When our State‚Äôs Public Health and Mental Health systems become so eviscerated that vulnerable families have to face child protection investigations without prevention services, shame on us.

Electrostatic-pneumatic MEMS devices usually consist of two membranes with a sealed cavity in between. One membrane calling actuator deflects into cavity by electrostatic pressure to compress air and increase air pressure. Elevated pressure pushes the other membrane and cause dome shape. With direct electrostatic actuation on membrane, a concave shape is achieved. This method is used in MEMS deformable mirrors to create convex and concave mirrors.Moghimi, M. J. Wilson, C.

A member of the Republican Party, he served as the U.S. Representative for Virginia's 7th congressional district from 2014 to 2019. Brat came to national prominence when he defeated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the district's 2014 Republican primary. Brat's primary victory over Cantor made him the first primary challenger to oust a sitting House Majority Leader since the position's creation in 1899. He lost his reelection bid in the 2018 election to Democrat Abigail Spanberger. Early life and education David Alan Brat was born in Detroit, Michigan, on July 27, 1964. His father, Paul, was a doctor of internal medicine; his mother, Nancy, was employed as a social worker in Alma, Michigan, where he was raised. His family moved from Alma to Minnesota when David, the oldest of three boys, was in junior high. Brat graduated from Park Center Senior High School in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota. Brat earned a B.A. in business administration from Hope College in 1986, a master's degree in divinity from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1990 and a Ph.D. in economics from American University in 1995. Academic career After working for Arthur Andersen and as a consultant for the World Bank, in 1996 Brat joined the faculty of Randolph‚ÄìMacon College, where he served as chair of the department of economics and taught courses including \\"Britain in the International Economy\\", \\"International Economic Development\\", and \\"Business Ethics\\". From 2010 to 2012 Brat headed Randolph-Macon's BB&T; Moral Foundations of Capitalism program, one of 60 similar programs and chairs in the philosophy and economics departments at United States universities devoted to the study of capitalism and morality, endowed by the BB&T; Corporation. In 2006 Brat was appointed by Virginia governor Tim Kaine to the Governor's Advisory Board of Economists, a position he continues to hold. He has also served on the board of directors of the Richmond Metropolitan Authority, and on the advisory board of the Virginia Public Access Project. He is the Dean of the Liberty University School of Business. Early political career From 2005 to 2011 Brat worked as a special legislative assistant to Virginia state senator Walter Stosch in the area of higher education. In 2006 he was appointed by Democratic governor Tim Kaine to serve on a bipartisan economic advisory council. He was later reappointed by Republican Governor Bob McDonnell. Elections =2011 Virginia House of Delegates campaign = In August 2011 Brat announced he was running for the Virginia House of Delegates seat for the 56th district. There was no primary, and six Republican leaders met and chose Peter Farrell as the Republican nominee for the November 2011 general election. =2014 U.S. House campaign= Republican primary Dave Brat speaking at an event in February 2016. Brat's run for the House of Representatives in 2014 was notable in its lack of resources and traditional campaign tactics. In his challenge of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor for the Republican nomination, Brat was outspent by Cantor 40 to 1: Cantor spent over $5 million, while Brat raised $200,000 and did not spend all of it. Brat's primary campaign was managed by 23-year-old Zachary Werrell. An analysis of campaign filings conducted by the Center for Responsive Politics concluded that Brat did not receive any donations from political action committees (PACs), noting \\"it's almost impossible to profile Brat's typical donor, because he had so few.\\" Brat's victory garnered national attention, as it was the first time a sitting House Majority Leader was defeated in his primary race since the position was created in 1899. Brat defeated Cantor by a 12-point margin. Compared with Cantor, described as aloof, Brat was characterized as knowing how to work a crowd.J.S., \\"Who Is David Brat?\\" , Democracy in America blog, The Economist, June 16, 2014. Retrieved October 29, 2014. He ran an anti-establishment campaign criticizing Cantor's position on illegal immigration, government bailouts and budget deals while frequently invoking God and the United States Constitution in his speeches. During the campaign, Cantor criticized Brat as a \\"liberal professor\\" who had strong ties to Tim Kaine, Virginia's former Democratic governor and current junior Senator. Brat complained that Cantor had a \\"crony-capitalist mentality\\", putting the interests of the corporate sector ahead of small businesses. Radio talk show host Laura Ingraham endorsed Brat's candidacy and hosted a rally with him in a Richmond suburb. Brat was also supported by radio talk show host Mark Levin and Ann Coulter. Chris Peace, a state legislator who collaborated with Brat on state budget issues at Randolph-Macon College, said that Brat was inspired to run for Congress because of \\"his passion for the structure of government and belief in free markets.\\" Brat's victory was described in the press as exposing a \\"deep schism\\" in the Republican party between its conservative base and its business wing, as well as a split between establishment Republicans and Tea Party insurgents. Some libertarian groups, such as the Virginia Liberty Party, backed Brat. Brat received support from, and gave credit for his win to, local Tea Party groups in Virginia, but received no funding or endorsement from national Tea Party organizations. Brat has not identified with the Tea Party movement. Ron Rapoport, a political scientist at the College of William & Mary, has said Brat may be correctly identified as a \\"tea partier\\" only if the term is used as a catchall for \\"anti-establishment activist\\", while John Judis has opined that Brat could more correctly be described as a \\"right-wing populist\\". Matea Gold in The Washington Post stated, \\"the fact that Brat took off without the help of those organizations [national tea party groups] now makes it harder for them to claim his victory as their own.\\" Although the national media were shocked at Brat's victory, Richmond-area media outlets had received signs well before the primary that Cantor was in trouble. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported two weeks before the primary that a number of Cantor's constituents felt he took them for granted. The Times-Dispatch also revealed that Cantor's attempt to brand Brat as a liberal professor actually made more people turn out for Brat. The Chesterfield Observer, a local paper serving Chesterfield County‚Äîroughly half of which is in the 7th‚Äîreported that Tea Party-aligned candidates had won several victories there, and at least one Cantor loyalist believed Tea Party supporters smelled \\"blood in the water.\\" One local reporter told David Carr of The New York Times that many constituents believed Cantor was arrogant and unapproachable. Due to massive cutbacks, the race was severely underpolled by local media. Few Capitol Hill reporters were willing to go to Cantor's district for fear that they would be out of Washington if a major story broke. General election Brat faced Democratic nominee Jack Trammell, another professor at Randolph-Macon, and James Carr, the Libertarian candidate, in the November general election. Brat was favored because of the 7th's significant Republican leaning (the district has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+10, showing it to be the most Republican district in eastern Virginia). According to an article in The Boston Globe, Cantor announced plans to aid Brat by resigning from the United States Congress on August 18, so that a special election for the balance of Cantor's seventh term could be held on the same day as the general election for a full two-year term. Thus the winner, in a race in which Brat was favored, would take office with two months' more seniority over other first-term Republicans elected in the 2014 midterm elections and the ability to participate in the lame-duck session of Congress. Brat defeated Trammell in that election, with 60.83% of the vote to Trammell's 36.95%. Carr finished third, with 2.09% of the vote. =2016 U.S. House campaign= A court-ordered redistricting significantly changed the 7th's configuration. It lost its share of Richmond to the neighboring 4th District; the 7th and its predecessors had included all or part of Richmond for over a century (it had been numbered as the 3rd District before 1993). It also lost Hanover County to the 1st District. Brat defeated Democrat Eileen Bedell with 57.7% of the vote in the general election on November 8, 2016. =2018 U.S. House campaign= Brat ran for a third term in 2018 against Henrico native and former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger. The race was rated \\"Safe Republican\\" by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report until October 13, 2017, when Cook updated the rating to \\"Likely Republican.\\" On February 8, 2018, the rating was changed to \\"Leans Republican,\\" and on July 7, 2018, the race was rated a \\"Toss-up.\\" During an October 2018 debate, Brat characterized Spanberger as a disciple of Nancy Pelosi. Brat referred to Pelosi 25 times, according to the Washington Post's conservative estimate, drawing laughs from the audience and the widely reported rejoinder, \\"Abigail Spanberger is my name.\\" Brat ultimately lost to Spanberger, 48.4% to 50.4%, due in part to a large swing in the district's shares of Henrico and Chesterfield counties, traditional Republican strongholds. While Brat carried five of the district's seven counties, Spanberger defeated him in Henrico and Chesterfield by a combined 30,600 votes, five times the overall margin of 6,600 votes. U.S. House of Representatives Brat was sworn in on November 12, 2014, to finish Cantor's term. He was a member of the Freedom Caucus. On January 6, 2015, Brat was one of 25 House Republicans to vote against John Boehner's reelection as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Boehner, who needed at least 205 votes, was reelected with 216 votes.French, Lauren (January 6, 2015) ‚Äì \\"Hell No Caucus Sees Silver Lining In Loss\\" . POLITICO. Retrieved February 26, 2015. Though Brat supported Boehner earlier, he reversed his support after the House GOP leadership did not allow him to make an amendment to block a controversial executive order signed by President Barack Obama in a spending bill.Camia, Catalina (January 5, 2015) ‚Äì \\"Rep. Dave Brat: Boehner Won't Have My Support\\" . USA Today. Retrieved February 26, 2015. Brat faced heckling by 150 people at a \\"raucous\\" town hall meeting in the small town of Blackstone, Virginia, on February 21, 2017. Some questioned him on the border wall, health care, and President Trump's policies. Several of Brat's supporters left the meeting early. He was criticized for not meeting with his constituents because he claimed there were paid protesters among them. On January 28, at a meeting held at Hanover Tavern with \\"the GOP-friendly audience\\", he had lamented that, \\"[s]ince Obamacare and these issues have come up, the women are in my grill no matter where I go. They come up ‚Äî 'When is your next town hall?' And believe me, it‚Äôs not to give positive input.\\" He also urged his fellow conservatives at the Tavern to write newspaper articles because \\"we‚Äôre getting hammered.\\" Brat considered running in Virginia's 2018 Senate election. In November 2017 the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that a campaign staffer was using her personal Facebook profile to debate commenters on his Facebook posts. The woman did not identify herself as a paid campaign staffer. When asked about this, Brat said, \\"Her job is to clarify issues and put out my policy positions from my vantage point. It‚Äôs not to argue with people.\\" Brat had another run-in with social media on March 1, 2018, when it was discovered that his campaign Twitter account had \\"liked\\" several controversial tweets, including one that questioned whether one of the survivors of the Parkland school shooting, David Hogg, was a \\"crisis actor\\". After an outcry from concerned constituents, Brat's office issued a statement that attributed the likes to a campaign staffer who believed they were logged into their personal account. He also said that safeguards were being put in place to ensure it did not happen again. =Committee assignments= *Committee on the Budget *Committee on Education and the Workforce **Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education **Subcommittee on Workforce Protections *Committee on Small Business **Subcommittee on Agriculture, Energy and Trade **Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access (Chairman) Economic views  Brat asserts that culture matters in economic markets. He believes that the culture that produced Adam Smith was a Protestant culture and that fact and the ethics of that culture are important in understanding market efficiency. Brat advocated that Christians should more forcefully support free-market capitalism and behave more altruistically, in the manner of Jesus, so that \\"we would not need the government to backstop every action we take.\\" According to Kevin Roose in a New York Magazine article, Brat \\"sees free-market economics as being intricately linked to ethics and faith and he makes the case that Adam Smith's invisible hand theory, should be seen in the context of Christianity\\". Furthering the central theme of Max Weber's seminal book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Brat argues in his 2004 paper Economic Growth and Institutions: The Rise and Fall of the Protestant Ethic? that \\"institutions such as religion, democracy and government anti-diversion policies all significantly enhance a country's long-run economic performance,\\" and concludes that \\"the religion variable may be the strongest ex ante, exogenous institutional variable in the literature.\\" In a paper titled Is Growth Exogenous? Taking Bernanke Seriously, Brat criticized Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, asserting that Bernanke's work on economic growth overlooks religious institutions‚Äîin particular Protestant‚Äîin a country's economic growth, and that while savings rates, population growth, and human capital accumulation help drive economic growth, the larger factor is \\"the Protestant religious establishment\\", which Bernanke ignores. Brat has blamed the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany on the lack of \\"unified resistance\\", adding, \\"I have the sinking feeling that it could all happen again, quite easily.\\" Brat believes that countries with Protestant pasts have economic advantages over countries that do not, and that Protestantism \\"provides an efficient set of property rights and encourages a modern set of economic incentives\\" that often lead to \\"positive economic performance\\". He believes in Christ as a transformer of culture, and that capitalism is the key to world transformation, which can be achieved when capitalism and Christianity merge; if people follow the gospel, and as a consequence behave more morally, he argues, then the markets will improve. Zack Beauchamp from Vox Media has said that Brat believes that \\"most economists are motivated by philosophy rather than science: they're secretly utilitarians who believe that the goal of public policy is to produce the greatest good for the greatest number.\\" Although Brat has said he does not identify as a Randian, he has acknowledged having been influenced by Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged and expressed appreciation of her case for human freedom and capitalism. Political positions Conservative Review graded Brat's voting record an A with a Liberty Score of 100%. Brat was one of two Republican representatives to receive this highest possible grade out of 247 Republicans in the House of Representatives, along with Jim Jordan of Ohio. =Economy= Brat promised to vote against raising the debt ceiling for the first five years while he was in Congress, and attacked Cantor during the primary campaign for voting to end the federal government shutdown of 2013. Brat advocated an end to tax credits, deductions and loopholes, and called for a flatter and more efficient tax code. He opposed TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program of 2008, and said that, if elected, he would \\"vote against bills that benefit big business over small business\\". \\"I'm not against business. I'm against big business in bed with big government\\", he said. Brat supported President Trump's trade policies, arguing that Americans benefitted from re-negotiating NAFTA and that while tariffs on China would cause short-term harms, they would ultimately lead to \\"zero tariffs.\\" =Education= Brat opposed federally driven education policies such as the Common Core curriculum and No Child Left Behind. =Ethics reform= Brat's decision to enter the Republican primary was driven largely by Cantor's role in weakening congressional ethics reform. \\"If you want to find out the smoking gun in this campaign, just go Google and type the STOCK Act and CNN and Eric Cantor\\", Brat said. =Healthcare= Brat opposed the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). In March 2017 he said he opposed the initial version of the American Health Care Act, which was the GOP's replacement for Obamacare, and that he intended to vote against it in the House Budget Committee. On May 4, 2017, Brat voted to repeal Obamacare and pass the revised version of the American Health Care Act. He said the bill contained protections for preexisting conditions and would lead to lower prices; The Washington Post noted that the bill would have allowed insurers to charge higher premiums for individuals with preexisting conditions, and that an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that average health care premiums would increase as a result of the bill (more so for older Americans). During his 2018 reelection campaign Brat falsely claimed that The Washington Post fact-checker had given \\"four Pinocchios\\" to his opponent Abigail Spanberger for claims she made about Brat's position on health care. The Washington Post fact-checker asked Brat to comment on his misrepresentation but did not receive a response. =Foreign policy and defense= Brat called for the National Security Agency to end bulk collection of phone records and stated his support for statutory protections for e-mail privacy. He argued that domestic intelligence activities have \\"spun out of control\\" and that \\"the NSA's indiscriminate collection of data on all Americans is a disturbing violation of our Fourth Amendment right to privacy.\\" In an April 21, 2015, interview with radio talk show host Rusty Humphries, Brat claimed that the terrorist group ISIS had set up a base in Texas. \\"In our country it looks like we have an ISIS center in Texas now...You can't make up what a terrible problem this is.\\" After the Texas Department of Public Safety responded that there was no substantiation for the claim, Brat's office said that he had really meant Mexico, not Texas, citing the conservative group Judicial Watch, which declined to provide any substantiation for its report.Dylan Baddour, \\"U.S Rep. says ISIS operates Texas base\\" , Houston Chronicle, May 5, 2015 (Updated May 8, 2015), Retrieved May 8, 2015 =Immigration = Brat supported President Trump's 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail immigration from the Muslim-majority nations of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen until better screening methods are devised. Brat said that \\"the temporary halt on migration from seven countries will last only a few months until we have solid vetting procedures in place\\" and that \\"these seven countries with a temporary travel ban have been identified by both the Obama administration and our intelligence agencies as being the greatest threat to our national security because they have a history of training, harboring, and exporting terrorism.\\" In September 2017 Brat said that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which provided temporary stay for unauthorized immigrants brought to the United as minors, allowed minors to \\"bring in their entire extended family once they reach a certain status\\" and could bring in up to 4 million additional immigrants. PolitiFact disputed Brat's figure. =Social issues= In 2011 Brat criticized the political right for simultaneously advancing the pursuit of individual liberty while pushing laws restricting abortion, gay rights and gambling, and the political left for simultaneously supporting progressive liberal individualism while coercing others to \\"fund every social program under the sun\\". Brat's website said he supported \\"the life of every child, both born and unborn.\\" =Social Security and Medicare= Brat criticized both major parties' approach to Medicare and Social Security, stating, \\"neither side of the aisle will talk about the most important issues because that is going to involve pain.\\" He advocated \\"market-based reforms\\" to these programs, arguing individuals ought not to receive more from programs than they have paid into them. Brat has suggested age- and means-based reform to the eligibility of claimants for mandatory entitlements as a way to avoid insolvency. =Term limits= Brat was a proponent of term limits for members of Congress.

The house was built by Allen Christian circa 1835 as the center of a farm that would become one of the major dairy suppliers in central North Alabama. After Christian's death in 1849, the house was purchased by Augustine and Mary Withers. Former Governor of Alabama Reuben Chapman acquired the house in 1873, after his previous house nearby had been burned by departing Union soldiers in 1865. The house remained in Chapman's family from 1873 until 1971. The surrounding farmland has been sold off into suburban development, but the house retains a prominent position on a 2-acre (0.8 ha) lot on a hillside. The -story house was built in the Federal style, with Greek Revival details. The house is clad in white clapboard and features a pedimented portico supported by four Tuscan columns over the entry. The portico is flanked by twelve-over- twelve sash windows. On each side of the house, two chimneys project through the end gable. There are two nine-over-nine windows between the chimneys on the main floor and a single twelve-over-twelve window on the upper floor. A central chimney and a shed roofed porch along the rear (connecting the formerly free-standing kitchen to the main house) were added in the 1930s. The interior is laid out with a central hall, with a dining room and parlor to one side and two bedrooms to the other. A stairwell at the end of the hall leads to two bedrooms upstairs. A shed roofed porch along the rear two-thirds of the eastern wall was enclosed in the 1960s to provide space for bathrooms. See also: The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Monte Sano Dairy Monte Sano Dairy, established in 1889 by William Matthews and Milton Humes, was home to the legendary butter-producing cow of the 1890s, Lily Flagg. The dairy was not especially close to Monte Sano Mountain, but nonetheless provided milk to much of Huntsville. Matthews left the dairy in 1894, and the Chapmans continued to operate it, quartering troops from the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and providing them water and milk in 1898. During the Great Depression, Josephine Gaboury gave milk to children without expecting payment, often saying \\"The little children must have milk.\\" Dairy operations continued through World War II, and scaled back thereafter.

Early life  Juozas Gabrys was born on February 22, 1880 in the town of Garliava, near the city of Kaunas, Lithuania. He went to the Garliava primary school starting at the age of seven. He graduated with a law degree from the University of Odessa in 1907.  Biography  Gabrys was a secretary of the Great Seimas of Vilnius during the 1905 Russian Revolution. He went into exile in 1907 to Paris. There, in 1911, he founded the Lithuanian Information Bureau. In 1912, he founded the Union des Nationalit√©s. These two organizations supplied European powers with information on Lithuania and other exploited European countries that crusaded for human rights and freedom. In 1915, Gabrys moved from Paris to Lausanne, Switzerland. He started a campaign of political activities and held the first Lithuanian conferences during World War I to obtain freedom for Lithuania. His campaigns were financed by Lithuanian immigrants of the United States and the German Foreign Ministry. He published articles in more than fifty European newspapers for his campaigns, sometimes bribing editors to get them through. His greatest success in organization was the Congress of Nationalities held in Switzerland in 1916 with 400 representatives from 23 nationalities. According to Alfred E. Senn, \\"Gabrys was undoubtedly the best known Lithuanian political figure on the European scene before 1916.\\" During the time period of World War I, Gabrys hoped to secure independence for Lithuania. He communicated the cruel treatment the Lithuanians were receiving from the German military when they were occupying Lithuania to the French authorities. He also called upon the Allies of World War I for assisting against German occupation. Gabrys involved the Vatican in a worldwide collection of millions of Swiss francs for Lithuanian victims of war, which ultimately ended up in his personal bank accounts. He labelled himself \\"Count of Garlawa\\" in his memoirs. When the new Lithuanian government started at the end of 1918, Gabrys was not a political participant because of his disagreements with the government officials. Because of his German government contacts during World War I, he ultimately \\"became virtually an unperson\\" in Lithuanian history despite his efforts to liberate the country.  Later life  In 1919, with the help of the French, Gabrys unsuccessfully attempted to get a Lithuanian government position. From that point on, he dabbled in Lithuanian politics until he retired. In retirement, he became a gentleman-farmer in Switzerland. Gabrys died on 26 July 1951 at Corsier-sur-Vevey in Switzerland.  Works  Gabrys is the only leading Lithuanian liberation political advocate during World War I to write his memoirs in a Western language.

Garcia, who led the investigation and supervised the report redaction. The Garcia Report was an investigation produced by Michael J. Garcia into allegations of corruption in world football (soccer). Garcia was appointed in July 2012 to investigate ethical breaches at the FIFA, football's world governing body. A month later he announced an investigation into persistent public accusations of bribery and corruption in the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids, which had been won in 2010 by Russia and Qatar respectively. After a two year investigation, Garcia submitted his 350-page report in September 2014, to Hans-Joachim Eckert, the FIFA's head of adjudication on ethical matters.Michael Garcia sends World Cup report to FIFA Eckert refused to publish the report, citing various legal grounds, instead releasing his own 42-page summary in November 2014. Eckert's summary was criticised in the media as a whitewash; Garcia described it as \\"materially incomplete\\". After unsuccessfully appealing for the FIFA to publish the full report, Garcia resigned in protest. Over the following years there was much speculation in the media regarding the contents of the report, particularly which aspects Eckert had left out of his summary and Garcia had felt were serious enough to warrant his resignation. In June 2017, the German newspaper Bild announced that it had obtained a leaked copy of the report and planned to publish it. FIFA released the report on the following day, pre-empting the newspaper coverage. Appointment of Garcia and Eckert On 17 July 2012, in the wake of announced anti-corruption reforms by the President of the FIFA, Sepp Blatter, the organisation appointed former United States Attorney Michael J. Garcia as Chairman of the investigative branch of its Ethics Committee, while German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert was appointed as Chairman of the Ethics Committee's adjudication chamber. The reformed Ethics Committee was also given the power to retrospectively investigate old cases. As Garcia and Eckert fulfilled FIFA's statute of them or their families not having a paid connection to soccer in the previous four years, The Guardian wrote that \\"Garcia and Eckert are regarded as key independent figures from outside the so-called 'football family' who can help restore FIFA's credibility after bribery and vote-buying scandals.\\" Upon their appointment, Garcia and Eckert were immediately tasked to investigate alleged illegal payments made by FIFA marketing company International Sports and Leisure (ISL) to former FIFA President Jo√£o Havelange and former Executive Committee member Ricardo Teixeira, as well as to evaluate the behaviour of FIFA President Sepp Blatter in the affair. ISL had specialized in buying and selling broadcast rights to FIFA events such as World Cups on contracts worth millions of dollars. The case was closed on 30 April 2014 after an investigation by Garcia, with Eckert ruling that bribes had been paid by ISL between 1992 and 2000 to Havelange, Teixeira and Nicolas Leoz, then-President of CONMEBOL. As Havelange (honorary President of FIFA) and Leoz had already resigned from their posts earlier in April 2014, no \\"superfluous\\" further action was taken. In contrast, Blatter was exonerated of \\"criminal or ethical misconduct\\", but was also described as \\"clumsy\\" and it was questioned whether he \\"knew or should have known over the years before the bankruptcy of ISL that ISL had made bribes to other FIFA officials\\". Garcia investigation and remit In August 2012, Garcia declared his intention to investigate the bidding process and decision to award the right to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup to Russia and Qatar respectively by the FIFA Executive Committee. The decision of host venues had previously taken place in December 2010. In May 2011, while before a British parliamentary inquiry, the former chairman of England's failed 2018 bid, David Triesman, accused FIFA executive committee members Jack Warner, Worawi Makudi, Nicolas Leoz and Ricardo Teixeira of requesting bribes from the English team in exchange for support. The parliamentary inquiry also received evidence from The Sunday Times that FIFA executive committee members Issa Hayatou and Jacques Anouma were reportedly bribed with $1.5m by the Qatar team. The whistleblower who spoke to The Sunday Times, Phaedra Al Majid, retracted her allegations in July 2011. In December 2011, The Daily Telegraph reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation were investigating alleged hacking into email accounts for England and the United States' World Cup bids. FIFA forbids bid teams to offer incentives to members of its executive committee and their relatives. Garcia subsequently expanded his investigation into the entire bidding process for the 2018 World Cup. Garcia's investigation allowed him to demand interviews with football officials, with those refusing subject to disciplinary action. Garcia was not able to interview Mohammed bin Hammam, the former FIFA vice-president, as Hammam is banned for life from football activity. Garcia's investigation remit extended solely to individuals who might have violated FIFA's code of ethics. Garcia was expected to name individuals who refused to speak to him in his report. Garcia has no ability to subpoena people to speak to him or to ask internet service providers for documents. Garcia was assisted in his production of the report by Cornel Borb√©ly, the deputy chairman of the investigatory chamber of the FIFA ethics committee. Borb√©ly produced the section of the report that investigated Russia, as Garcia was sanctioned from entering the country, and the United States, to prevent a potential conflict of interest as Garcia is American. Russia was the only bidding country which Garcia failed to travel to in the course of his investigations. Blocked publication by Eckert Garcia delivered his 350-page report in September 2014, and it was subsequently announced by Hans-Joachim Eckert, the head of the adjudicatory arm of FIFA's ethics committee, that it would not be made public for legal reasons. Eckert said that only his judgement on the report will be published, in the spring of 2015, and the report had only been seen by four people. Eckert later announced that his overview of the Garcia report with Garcia's main findings, summary, conclusions and recommendations will be published by the middle of November 2014. Eckert has said that \\"Many won't like what I am going to tell them\\" in reference to his forthcoming judgement on the report. Eckert will only judge individuals, and will leave the decision on the hosting of the 2018 and 2022 world cups to FIFA. Garcia, along with some members of the FIFA Executive Committee, called for the Garcia report to be published in full, excepting names redacted to protect whistleblowers. Garcia has said of FIFA that its \\"... investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard...That's a kind of system which might be appropriate for an intelligence agency but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution that serves the public and is the subject of intense public scrutiny.\\" Summary released and Garcia resignation On 13 November 2014, Hans-Joachim Eckert released a 42-page summary of his findings after reviewing Michael Garcia's report; the summary cleared both Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing during the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, leaving Russia and Qatar free to stage their respective World Cups. The summary noted that Russia provided \\"only a limited amount of documents available for review\\", as the computers leased to the Russian team had been destroyed, and several email accounts were unable to be accessed. The Eckert summary was harsher on England and Australia, who had unsuccessful World Cup bids, finding \\"potentially problematic facts and circumstances\\" in their bids and stating that they had undermined the integrity of the bidding. England was described as behaving improperly when trying to win the support of then- CONCACAF head Jack Warner. Australia was criticized for the links between its bid and its funding of football development in African countries, and that two Australia consultants \\"violated the bidding and ethics rules\\". The bid teams for Japan and South Korea were also criticized for distributing \\"gifts\\" and giving the appearance of \\"a conflict or an offer of benefits\\" respectively. The FIFA welcomed \\"the fact that a degree of closure has been reached\\", while the Associated Press wrote that the Eckert summary \\"was denounced by critics as a whitewash\\". Hours after the Eckert summary was released, Garcia himself criticized it for being \\"materially incomplete\\" with \\"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\\", while declaring his intention to appeal to the FIFA's Appeal Committee. There were several calls for the Garcia report to be released, including from FIFA Executive Committee members Jim Boyce, Jeffrey Webb and Sunil Gulati, as well as FIFA presidential candidate Jerome Champagne and English Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore. Eckert, who was \\"surprised\\" by Garcia's response, refused to accede to calls to release the Garcia report, citing the \\"rights of confidentiality for continental law\\". Less than a week later, Eckert was quoted as saying that the investigation was only at \\"an interim stage\\" and that Garcia \\"can now continue investigating towards the final report\\". On 15 November 2014, German Football League president Reinhard Rauball warned that UEFA may quit FIFA if Garcia's report is not published in full, citing that \\"If this doesn't happen and the crisis is not resolved in a credible manner, you have to entertain the question of whether you are still in good hands with FIFA\\". On 18 November 2014, acting on the recommendation of Eckert, the FIFA lodged a criminal complaint with the Swiss judiciary relating to the \\"possible misconduct of individual persons in connection with the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup\\", specifically regarding \\"international transfers of assets with connections to Switzerland\\". On 16 December 2014, the FIFA's Appeal Committee dismissed Garcia's appeal against the Eckert summary as \\"not admissible\\". FIFA also stated that Eckert's summary was \\"neither legally binding nor appealable\\". A day later, Garcia resigned from his role as FIFA ethics investigator in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \\"lack of leadership\\" and lost confidence in the independence of Eckert from the FIFA. Pending release of the redacted Garcia Report On 19 November 2014, following a presentation by Domenico Scala, head of FIFA's audit and compliance committee and one of only six people to have seen the report at that time, FIFA's executive committee unanimously agreed to publish a \\"legally appropriate version\\" of the Garcia report, with parts redacted to preserve witness confidentiality. However, the Garcia Report will only be published after five ongoing ethics investigations started by Garcia into the following individuals are concluded; for √Ångel Mar√≠a Villar, Michel D'Hooghe, Worawi Makudi, Franz Beckenbauer and Harold Mayne-Nicholls. Meanwhile, the decision not to revisit the 2018 and 2022 vote was reaffirmed by the FIFA after Scala said that two independent legal experts he consulted supported that decision. Walter De Gregorio, in a press conference on 27 May 2015, stated that the Garcia report has been in the hands of the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland since 19 November 2014.

In Egypt he transferred to the 111th Howitzer Battery of the 4th Division Artillery when that division was formed after the evacuation of Gallipoli. By May 1916, he was in France (at Croix du Bac near Steenwerck) with the AIF as a Wireless Operator and Signalman. On 2 June Briggs was attached to No.16 Squadron RFC at La Gorge aerodrome in France for six weeks. This attachment was to develop co-operation between the RFC and the artillery using air to ground wireless radio, then still in its infancy. Briggs was selected for the task because he had knowledge of the area which he had picked up during forward O.P. (observation post) duty. His first flight in a plane resulted in his first crash. On this flight he was to be observer for a young English pilot with about 18 hours solo flying experience. On take-off they flew into a hedge bordering the aerodrome and ended up hanging upside-down in their seats. Neither crew nor plane were seriously damaged; an ox was not so lucky. Briggs' job with No. 16 Squadron was to observe and range for the artillery. Before take-off in their BE2c the plane crew tested and warmed their guns. With cameras, ammunition and four Cooper bombs on board it often took twelve to fifteen minutes to reach 2,500 feet, with the plane travelling at 75 miles per hour. They conducted the shoots at 5,000 to 7,000 feet altitude and up to five miles behind the lines, depending on the type of gun and the target. The aircraft normally carried out the shoot alone, but if it was an especially important operation then a flight of fighters were assigned to provide top cover. The fighters at this time were mostly Sopwith Pups, Bristol Scouts, DH1s, DH2s and the FE8. At this time the RFC did not have a synchronised gun. Briggs' first combat was a \\"no decision show\\". The pilot was Captain Brown (later Major Brown MC). They were conducting a shoot when attacked by an Albatros D.II scout. The Albatros had better speed, better climb and a synchronised gun. The BE2c had two guns. One was set at an angle to fire outside the propeller arc and was operated by the pilot. The observer, who sat directly behind the engine, had a gun mounted on the fuel tank which separated him from the pilot. He could fire in an arc between the wing tip and the tail plane. Then, unless he wanted to cut the pilot in half, he had to lift the gun up then drop it down on the other side. Captain Brown decided that discretion was the better part of valour, and they \\"scootered for home\\". Brown and Briggs gained three \\"probables\\" but none were confirmed. The only German aircraft types Briggs encountered at this time were the Albatros D.II, the Fokker Biplane and the Halberstadt. No. 16 Squadron had four flights of seven aircraft, all BE2c's powered by the 90 h.p. RAF factory engine. These engines required constant replacement (Briggs reported). After six weeks, during which Briggs had learnt to love aircraft and flying, he returned to his unit. In October a circular was promulgated that sought volunteers from the AIF to be Royal Flying Corps pilots. Briggs and, as he put it, 99.99 recurring percent of the AIF, applied. On 7 November Briggs was among about 250 members of the Division invited to interviews with RFC \\"brass hats\\". The men soon realised that a good education and sporting prowess were regarded favourably, so the RFC officers must have thought that every Australian Olympic athlete and university student was in the AIF. On 13 November Briggs learnt he had been selected by the Royal Flying Corps. Two other men were selected from Briggs' division (4th Division) at this time ‚Äì Charles Kingsford Smith and Edgar Johnston, all three survived the war. =Royal Flying Corps= Training Oxford, England, February 1917. Formal large group portrait of instructors and part of the first group of 200 Australian cadets from the 1st AIF to attend a School of Aeronautics training course after they had volunteered to train as pilots for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). Briggs is second from the left in the second row. Initial training, starting November 1916, was at Denham, Buckinghamshire. This training continued at Oxford from January to March 1917. The cadets were quartered at various colleges. Briggs was at Exeter College, where his roommate was Edgar Johnston. In a lecture room on 2 February Briggs' eyes started to smart badly, and he felt very unwell. It turned out he had German measles and he spent a few days in hospital. Several other cadets joined him, including Percival Moody (who years later was an air-mail pilot for Qantas). On 10 March all the cadets succeeded in their examinations and passed out from Oxford. On 17 March Briggs was simultaneously honourably discharged from the AIF and admitted to the RFC as a second lieutenant. On 24 March Briggs was in Thetford to start training (with No. 25 Training Squadron) on an aircraft, the Maurice Farman Shorthorn, known as a \\"Rumpty\\". His instructor was Captain Foggin. On 15 June, after twenty hours of flying solo, Briggs was amazed to receive orders to report to a training squadron (No. 52 Training Squadron) in Stirling as an instructor. Scotland On 30 July Briggs was introduced to his first six pupils. First in the air was a gentleman named Pitt-Pitts, believed by Briggs to be great grandson of the famous British statesman Pitt. On 19 August Briggs crashed his Martinsyde Elephant aircraft. He and other members of the squadron had been in the habit of flying very low over the local golf course on their return, a practice the CO had banned. The procedure involved hopping across traffic on a road bordering the aerodrome, plus a wall separating the road and the aerodrome. On this occasion Briggs hurdled a car on the road, but then noticed that the car was the CO's and saw his enraged face staring out. Distracted for a split second he forgot about the wall, had to climb almost vertically, stalled and crashed on the aerodrome side of the wall. Briggs walked away without a scratch but with badly bruised feet. The CO was so relieved Briggs was OK that all he did was shake his head at him and he walked away speechless. The squadron relocated from Stirling to Montrose, where a fighter squadron No. 80 Squadron of Sopwith Camels was being formed. On 2 October Briggs was flying a De Havilland IV bomber when he noticed a Sopwith Camel using him as a practice target. He responded in kind, engaging the Camel, flying the De H. IV as if it were a fighter. When he landed the CO of No. 80 Squadron (Major Graham, an Australian) offered Briggs a place in his squadron, an offer which delighted Briggs (who was keen to see active service). Suffolk Briggs' hopes were soon dashed. Major Graham had started the transfer process, but Briggs learnt on 10 October that higher authority had decided he be transferred instead to the RFC Test and Experimental Station at Orfordness. Briggs recorded that Orfordness was regarded by pilots as \\"a very hush-hush show where high priests perform aerial magic\\". Briggs was at Orfordness on 14 October. The CO, Major Norman, had invented a machine-gun sight that made firing reasonably accurate for the average pilot. In the mess Briggs was introduced to two Oxford dons and a Cambridge don (one of whom, Captain Fairbairn, he later taught to fly). On the base he was delighted to discover another Australian, Lieutenant Wackett (the very resourceful Lawrence Wackett, who later invented a very efficient anti- aircraft gun sight). The reason he was posted to Orfordness was to conduct experiments in cloud flying (later known as blind flying) and aerial navigation. He was told that bad weather in France was restricting flying operations, if more pilots could get above the cloud on dirty weather days then more bombing could be carried out inside German territory. At this stage cloud flying was an unknown art, nobody could tell Briggs much about it. He depended on the standard rev. counter, airspeed indicator, inclinometer and compass. After two days at the station Briggs was joined by four more pilots who had been assigned to research cloud flying. These were Bell and Montmorency (Canadians) and Powell and Weller (Englishmen). They were soon able to fly through ten or twelve thousand feet of cloud in reasonable formation (Briggs recorded in his diary).

Duncan The squadron also acted as an unofficial Home Defence squadron. German raids on London passed over Orfordness on their way out and on their way back. Four months earlier a Zeppelin had been shot down by a station pilot.Mower, Mark, \\"The Final Raid of L48\\", Pen & Sword Books Ltd, 2008. Retrieved 15 June 2014. On the night of 19 October Briggs was part of a \\"reception committee\\" sent out to \\"welcome\\" some German visitors. Word was received that some Gotha bombers would soon pass overhead. Briggs took off in a B.E.12a and climbed to 15,000 feet, the height at which he thought the bombers would cross the North Sea. It was pitch black, and cold and miserable after cruising around for an hour or so, Briggs was starting to believe that the Gotha report was a \\"furphy\\". Then, for a fleeting second, he saw a flicker of flame, like a \\"will o' the wisp\\", then all was black again. After what seemed like an eternity he saw it again \\"obviously a tiny flame from an exhaust pipe .. about half a mile in front of me and slightly below\\". When he got closer he saw its (the flame's) twin and knew for certain he was behind a Gotha. Now, however, the tiny exhaust flames were becoming fainter. The Gotha was faster than Briggs' plane, he had only gained on it while diving from a higher altitude. Briggs fired a long burst, hoping the range was not as great as it looked, but the Gotha proceeded out of sight. The next morning the flight sergeant said \\"It certainly wasn't your fault that Hun got away!\\" and showed Briggs the throttle lever that he had bent trying to get more revs out of the engine. Another function of the Orfordness station was \\"proofing\\" every batch of bombs for delivery overseas. From every batch of 250 bombs, four were tested on a concrete target on the beach. If one failed to explode the whole batch was scrapped. On 5 November Briggs recorded an event involving Lawrence Wackett. Wackett had been up proofing some 112-pounders. He heard three detonations, but not the fourth, and assumed this was a dud. The fourth bomb was still partially attached to the bomb-carrying rack. It detached when the aircraft received a bump as Wackett was about to land. The machine went up on its nose, then over on its back. A startled Wackett climbed out of the wreckage. Two weeks later (on 18 November) Briggs had his own scare while proofing. He dropped a 360-pound bomb on the target from about 60 feet height. Two things then happened. The blast under the tail put the plane into an almost vertical dive position, and there was a loud \\"wham\\" from the aircraft. A piece of bomb casing had torn a fist-sized hole through the aircraft. As Briggs put it \\"six inches in the wrong direction and I would have had difficulty in sitting down for some long time\\". He resolved to drop bombs from a minimum height of 2,000 feet. Wiltshire The Air Ministry came up with a scheme to pass on the knowledge gained at Orfordness to other pilots. A squadron titled \\"No. 1 School of Aerial Navigation and Bomb Dropping\\" was to be set up at Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain. On 5 December Briggs, a corporal and six men were the first to arrive to set up the school. They were quartered for the time being at an infantry camp nearby. At this stage it was an aerodrome in name only, there were \\"no hangars, no nothing. At some time or other somebody has set up a bloody big heap of massive stones likely to prove obstructions on the edge of the drome\\". Four days later some Bessonneau hangars arrived for Briggs' team to erect. Another four days later (13 December) not one hangar was erected. Each morning they found the fierce winds of the plain had scattered the hangar they had erected the previous day across the aerodrome. On 17 December the remaining personnel for the school arrived and hangars started going up \\"like the price of wine\\". Briggs was delighted that George Powell, Sammy Weller and Dit Montmorency turned up to be fellow instructors. Close to the aerodrome at Stonehenge there was an Observation balloon School. On 23 January 1918 Briggs sent out a student pilot, Turner, to fly a triangular compass course at a height of 4,000 feet. The Observation Balloon School had a balloon up at 7,000 feet. Turner was so intent on his compass that he did not notice the cable tethering the balloon. The cable cut deeply into his right hand wing. The impact was such that the aircraft turned \\"on to its back\\" and started to slide down the cable, spinning rapidly around the cable. This continued till the machine was only five or six hundred feet off the ground. At this point the spinning motion flung the machine off the cable, and the machine was at the same time thrown right side up. It went into a glide and landed with no further damage on a piece of cleared ground. When some nearby artillery men ran over they found Turner still in his seat, but unconscious. When he recovered he stated that he had blacked out after the first three spins. The men from the balloon school spent much of their spare time at the aerodrome, scrounging joy rides. Briggs and company tried to \\"cure them by doing everything we knew in the air\\". This just increased the \\"balloonatics\\" appreciation, leading to invitations to visit their mess and to ascend in a balloon. One day (29 March), after repeated invitations, some forenoon drinking and a good lunch, George Powell and Briggs were persuaded to step into the basket of a balloon to get a \\"still air\\" view of the country. The balloon ascended to about 4,000 feet and Briggs found it novel to be at that height and not be deafened by the roar of an engine. Their enjoyment ended abruptly when their host said \\"What about a jump?\\". Before they could demur they each had a parachute harness buckled on and were receiving unheeded advice. On asking what would happen if something went wrong, Briggs was told he told he could take the parachute back to the Equipment Officer and get another one. To prevent the grin of his host from getting any wider Briggs closed his eyes and flopped off the basket. A sharp jerk caused him to open his eyes, and he was astonished to see the basket just 150 feet above him. After letting rip at his tormentor with some \\"pure bullocky Australian\\" language, Briggs found he was enjoying the most wonderful sensation he had ever known. He was so intrigued at the stillness that he held his watch to his ear, and heard it ticking away merrily. After a rather heavy landing Briggs vowed, with George Powell, not to go within miles of a kite balloon outfit for a very long time. The kite balloon 4,000 feet above Salisbury Plain from which the RFC's Francis Stewart Briggs parachuted on 29 March 1918. =Royal Air Force= Wiltshire Briggs was flying with his observer, Lieut. Peterkin, a Canadian, on 2 May when there was a bang. The rear cylinder head separated from the engine and the part with the spark plug went straight through the side of the petrol tank, igniting it. Fortunately Briggs, who was looking over the side of the \\"bus\\" at the time, saw the explosion out of the corner of his eye. He automatically switched off and put the aircraft into a vertical sideslip. The sideslip fanned the flames away from the fuselage and in less than a minute the flames were extinguished. After one more minute they landed safe, but badly scared, on an artillery parade ground. Briggs made repeated attempts to get posted to a service squadron, but the result was always negative. On 18 July he planned to go before a medical board to complain that Britain's cold and wet weather was aggravating his malaria, and suggest that he be posted to a warm climate such as Palestine. On 3 August he went before a medical board, with which he was honest about his application. On 19 August he received orders to report to Cairo, Egypt, where he would receive instructions regarding which squadron on the Palestine front he was being posted to. Egypt Briggs spent his 21st birthday (on 18 September) at Helouan in Egypt. His instructions had been to report to General Borton commanding the R.A.F. in the Middle East. In this interview Briggs received a rude shock. The Air Ministry had advised the general to use Briggs' talents in a new school, No. 3 School of Aerial Navigation and Bomb Dropping at Helouan, similar to the one at Stonehenge, that had been set up just before Briggs' arrival in Egypt. All protests were cut short, but the general conceded that he would only keep Briggs at the school for six months. After that he would be posted to whatever service squadron he elected. Helouan was a pleasant spot. Before the war it was a popular tourist resort, its main attraction being the sulphur baths. There was also a former hotel in which enemy aliens were interned. Briggs visited the building several times, playing games of bridge with cultured and charming Germans and Austrians. He pitied the way the internees of both sides were incarcerated, ruined and humiliated. General Borton must have remembered Briggs because in November, immediately after the Armistice, Briggs was ordered to return to England, to the great envy of those left behind. He lost no time in obeying this order, but between Cairo and Alexandria he developed Spanish flu. In six hours he became delirious and unconscious, and was taken off the train and into hospital by stretcher. For four days he remained in that state. When he came to he had one thought, to join the ship he was due to sail in, which was to leave in two days' time. He was due to stay in hospital for another two weeks, followed by a week in a convalescent camp. On the day he managed to evade the hospital authorities and get aboard without interference. Back in England at the end of January 1919 Briggs conceded he had been foolish not to accept the medical advice, he was still unwell at that time, many weeks after leaving Egypt. Hampshire (Andover) On arrival in London Briggs reported to the Air Ministry who posted him to \\"No. 2 School of Aerial Navigation and Bomb Dropping\\", which was formed at Andover, Hampshire, just before Briggs left for Egypt. At Andover, regarding this posting, Briggs wrote on 30 January 1919 \\"I feel too ill and weak even to laugh\\". Because of the Armistice, Andover was effectively a school in name only, a place where people marked time and waited to see what would happen next. It was a perfect place for Briggs to continue his recuperation. Middlesex Lieutenant Francis Stewart Briggs, RAF, at Hounslow in 1919 while serving with the Demonstration Squadron On 14 March Briggs wrote that he received instructions to report to the Demonstration Squadron at Hounslow. The squadron had just been formed \\"for what precise reason I don't think anybody quite knows\\". It was equipped with all sorts of machines imaginable. There was little organised flying. \\"If a couple of us feel like going up, say one in a Sopwith Snipe and the other in a Fokker D7, we just order the machines out and after taking to the air, scrap around the sky until fed up. We then land and adjourn for another gin and two.\\" On 3 April Briggs wrote \\"I was instructed to proceed to Hendon last Thursday afternoon in an Avro to give Mr. Winston Churchill a flying lesson. I duly arrived on time at that point and so did Winston Churchill. He took two looks at me, and one at a cloud overhead that started to sprinkle gentle spots of rain, then turned on his heel, re-entered his car, and drove off. I gather that he considered the weather unsuitable or that he didn't like my face.\\" Three weeks later, on 18 April, Briggs had one of the greatest thrills he had ever had. Major Barker V.C., who visited the squadron a couple of times, took Briggs on in mock combat. Though suffering the disability of a wound in one arm, he won Briggs' respect as a great pilot. Briggs got in a position to put in a very short burst, but believed this was because Barker let him. Surrey On 26 April Briggs was at Kenley. He had been ordered there to join the newly formed Communication Squadron (part of 86 Wing), who were to act as couriers between London and Paris, carrying delegates and dispatches to the Paris Peace Conference. On 2 May Briggs flew the King's Messenger Captain Blood to London with the final draft of the Peace Treaty for ratification by King George V, then flew Blood and the treaty back to Paris that evening. They flew by moonlight over a fog which extended from ten miles inland from the English coast to about twenty miles inland from the French coast. On 12 May Briggs was proud to have Australia's Prime Minister, William Morris Hughes, as his passenger for the first time. They flew from Buc, Paris, for London with Hughes' private secretary Percy Deane and important dispatches. The weather was beautiful when they took off. About 50 miles from the French coast they ran into low clouds. They flew above them, but about 30 miles further on Briggs realised it was fog, not cloud. Briggs decided to descend through the fog to find an aerodrome where he could phone for a weather report before crossing the Channel. He expected about 200 feet clearance between the fog and the ground, but there was less than fifty feet. Briggs had to make a tight vertical turn to avoid some poplar trees, which they missed by inches. They landed in a field and two or three soldiers ran towards them. They were clearly Australians and Briggs asked them where exactly they were. \\"Beside No 11 Australian Hospital, Abbeville\\" came the reply. Quick as a flash Hughes said \\"I can see you recognise me, boys. Take me along to your C.O. I have come especially to visit the hospital\\". While Hughes toured the hospital, Briggs got on the phone and learned that the fog extended right across the Channel and over half of England. This put paid to any ideas of reaching London and Briggs decided to sneak along below the fog to an aerodrome near the coast. He collected Hughes and Deane and after half an hour of hedge-hopping and tree- dodging they landed at Maisoncelle aerodrome. Maisoncelle was occupied by No. 110 Squadron RAF, equipped with DH9a's. They were running an air mail service from Maisoncelle to the Army of Occupation in Germany. A fresh weather report showed the fog had worsened and they decided to spend the night there. The CO (H.R. Nicholls) apologised to Hughes that the only bed he could offer was just a wooden frame with wire netting stretched across it to form a mattress. At breakfast next morning Hughes reported that, though he suffered from insomnia and had had no real sleep for weeks, he had slept like a top. He ascribed this to the flying, not the bed. Unfortunately the fog was denser than the day before. It was decided that Hughes and Deane would be motored to Boulogne from where they could get a steamer to cross the Channel. Briggs would attempt to fly to Marquise aerodrome near Boulogne. On arrival at Boulogne Hughes would phone Marquise to see if Briggs had arrived. If so Hughes would travel to Marquise, as Briggs was confident he could reach London if he could get through to Marquise. The CO at Marquise, Sidney \\"Crasher\\" Smith, was astonished to see Briggs, as he did not think any aircraft could be flying that day. Hughes learnt that Briggs had arrived at Marquise, and promptly came to the aerodrome. Hughes and Briggs were both in for a shock as \\"Crasher\\" was adamant that he would not permit the flight. Eventually he persuaded Hughes to continue by boat. He omitted to notify London and Paris of this decision. As a result, there were fears that Hughes, Deane and Briggs had perished in the Channel. A steamer came across the wreckage of a plane in the Channel. A wheel removed from the wreck identified it as a DH4, the type of machine Briggs was flying. Briggs' flight was the only one likely to be crossing the Channel that day, so it was concluded the wrecked machine was Briggs'. After Hughes arrived in London the fears for his safety were dispelled, only to be replaced by conjecture as to the occupants of the mystery machine. After much enquiry it transpired that Jefferson, an RAF pilot, had been sent to the Netherlands to pick up Henrickson, the Dutch food controller, and fly him to London. They had crashed and drowned in the fog over the Channel. At Buc on 27 May the RAF were guests at the French Flying Corps mess. Briggs wrote \\"They are excellent hosts, and one of the best was Georges Carpentier, the world's light and heavyweight boxing champion. I am one of the very few who can claim victory over this redoubtable one. I laid him low last night\\". A cockfighting contest was held in the mess. The RAF Wing Commander, Colonel Harold Primrose, with Briggs as jockey staggered to the finals to be matched against Carpentier who was mounted on the hefty adjutant of the French outfit. After a great and lengthy bout Carpentier's mount tripped on the mat and the RAF team were declared the winners. On the afternoon of Saturday 28 June, Briggs and three companions from the Communication Squadron were flying above the Palace of Versailles waiting for \\"zero hour\\". As 3pm approached they got into \\"line ahead\\" formation and, precisely on the hour, dived down and flashed past the windows of the Hall of Mirrors. The roar of the engines, as the planes thundered past a few feet away, drowned out the first few sentences of Clemenceau's opening speech. That evening the Communication Squadron flew news copy and photos over to England for the London press. On the morning of 14 September the weather in France was atrocious. The wind was hurricane force, clouds were almost down to ground level, visibility was about a hundred yards and there was heavy driving rain. Briggs was anticipating a day in Paris with his colleagues, and was just about to leave when he was called in to see the CO, Major McCrindle. Briggs was told that it was imperative that Major-General Seely reach London that day, \\"if humanly possible\\". Would Briggs \\"have a go at it\\"? From Paris to Boulogne they flew no higher than fifty feet and were thrown about like a leaf. When they reached the coast they found the clouds were right down to the water. Briggs was tempted to land at Marquise aerodrome but, knowing the urgency of his passenger's mission, decided to try climbing above the cloud which was unbroken for 8,000 feet. The Channel and the English coast were invisible. Near Redhill Briggs found a break in the clouds, and wriggled across the Hog's Back into Kenley. On arrival he was asked if he had flown through the railway tunnel that runs through the Hog's Back. Briggs wrote that \\"I may have for all I know, because I was practically flying blind half-in and half-out of the clouds with the undercarriage wheels scraping the trees and house tops\\". Briggs was looking forward to partying in London when an orderly informed him that Colonel Primrose wished to see him. The Wing Commander told Briggs that there were urgent dispatches for Paris, and that, as Briggs had just done the reverse journey, he was the pilot most likely to get through. The return trip to Paris was worse, \\"a condition of affairs I didn't think possible\\". The average wind speed was over 70 m.p.h. gusting to more than 100 m.p.h. and there were vertical gusts. Neither coast nor the Channel were visible and the landing was in the dark by the aid of flares which the rain almost extinguished. Hampshire (Winchester) From October to December Briggs was at the RAF Repatriation Camp at Flowerdown, Winchester, which was commanded by Squadron Leader D.C.G. Sharp. Inter-War Years On 26 February 1920 Briggs was back in Adelaide, considering his future. Billy Hughes had invited Briggs to return to Australia with a view to joining the Australian Flying Corps, but as Briggs wrote \\"everything concerning our Air Force is most unsettled\\". Commercial aviation seemed to Briggs the better option, but at this time commercial aviation was little more than a range of possibilities. In March Briggs was in Melbourne. Two or three small companies and a few individuals there were offering joy-rides, but in Briggs' view the local outlook was not promising. While joy-riding kept the public \\"air-minded\\" it risked alienating the public because fares were very high even for short flights. \\"Something's got to be done to get civvy flying on its feet. But what is that something?... Wish I knew how !\\" Briggs wrote. In May Briggs was back in Adelaide, still wondering and waiting. The position seemed very bleak to him. On 26 June Briggs read in his newspaper about C. J. De Garis who was visiting Adelaide on business. The paper stated that he intended to use a plane to save time, as he had to travel between centres hundreds of miles apart. Briggs called on de Garis at the Grand Central Hotel. Within a few minutes of them meeting, de Garis told Briggs he was just the chap he was looking for. Mr de Garis promised to advise Briggs whether the job was his soon after he arrived in Melbourne. He left for Melbourne by train that afternoon. Two days later Briggs heard that the job was his, and was on the train to Melbourne the same day. Mr de Garis had already bought a machine, a Boulton and Paul 90 h.p. RAF V8, and Briggs felt his first task was to persuade Mr de Garis to replace this with a DH4. In test flights at Glenroy on 3 July Briggs viewed the Boulton and Paul as \\"a nice little machine with a fair turn of speed\\", but not rugged enough for the work ahead. Francis Stewart Briggs (left inset) and Clement John de Garis (right inset) in front of their Boulton and Paul P9 aircraft, July 1920 On 6 July Briggs made his first trip to Sydney, with de Garis as passenger. They flew from Mildura (de Garis' base) and reached Goulburn at dusk. Briggs had promised de Garis that he would be in Sydney that night so they pressed on for the aerodrome at Mascot, which would have flares out for a night landing. When they reached Picton Briggs saw what looked like a jewelled shawl ahead ‚Äì Sydney. The relief of sighting Sydney was soon followed by the anxiety of not locating Mascot aerodrome. The staff at the aerodrome must have headed home for belated dinners, thinking that Briggs was not coming. Briggs had no knowledge of Sydney, they had half an hour's fuel left, it was dark and they were in a machine not fitted for night flying. Briggs had not seen an instrument for the last hour and a half, he was flying entirely by horizon, formed by lights on the ground. A plan started to develop in his mind to land in the water near one of the lighted jetties. Suddenly he spotted what appeared to be an open field with a pool of water in the middle of it. The water reflected the lights from an elevated railway station nearby. He throttled back and manoeuvred to land on one side. The reflection of the lights in the water helped reveal the ground level. Two or three blurred objects flitted past the undercarriage, then they were down, with a slight bump. A man with a lantern came running over. \\"Where are we?\\" de Garis asked. \\"Canterbury Racecourse\\" was the answer. The next day Briggs, with de Garis, flew the aircraft to Mascot. Two days later Briggs and de Garis left Sydney for Melbourne, hoping to be the first to make this journey in one day. They succeeded, in a flying time of 6 hours 30 minutes, with one stop at Cootamundra to refuel. As they approached Glenroy one of the engine cylinders blew off and they had to land in a field about two miles from the aerodrome. A rock outcrop concealed by the long grass caught the centre of the axle and the aircraft gently turned over. There was only slight damage to the aircraft. Rather than be delayed by the necessary repairs, de Garis (on 12 July) bought a Sopwith Gnu (from the Larkin-Sopwith Aviation Company), so that they could continue flying on 17 July. The crashed plane was sold back (where it lay) to Aviation Ltd, from whom it had been bought. On 9 August de Garis received a telegram from Admiral Halsey asking him if he would meet the train from Perth at Port Augusta with his aeroplane and pilot, and fly the mail for the Prince of Wales to Sydney. The Prince of Wales was to leave Australia on from Sydney a couple of days before mail from England to Sydney was due to arrive. Briggs told de Garis that the limited time available made this too great a task for their \\"little bus\\" (the Sopwith Gnu) and suggested they ask the Prime Minister (Billy Hughes) for the loan of a DH9a machine from the Defence Department. The Prime Minister was very receptive and passed Briggs on to Secretary Malcolm Shepherd. Shepherd passed Briggs on to Dicky Williams, the Commanding Officer of the Air Force. Briggs was told that his request was being granted, that the Commanding Officer would be Briggs' escort, and that another Air Force officer and machine would be sent to Mildura to act as a stand-by machine. The following day, when Briggs arrived at Point Cook, he was told his escort had left for Adelaide the previous day. Briggs asked for a mechanic to accompany him, but because Briggs was a civilian the request was refused. As mechanic Briggs took along a garage motor mechanic, Albert Smyth, whom he \\"recruited\\" at the last minute.

A public library is a library that is accessible by the general public and is generally funded from public sources, such as taxes. It is operated by librarians and library paraprofessionals, who are also civil servants. United States Street sign commonly used to point the way to a public library As the United States developed from the 18th century to today, growing more populous and wealthier, factors such as a push for education and desire to share knowledge led to broad public support for free libraries. In addition, money donations by private philanthropists provided the seed capital to get many libraries started. In some instances, collectors donated large book collections.Jesse Hauk Shera, Foundations of the public library;: The origins of the public library movement in New England, 1629‚Äì1885 (1965) =First libraries= William James Sidis in The Tribes and the States claims the public library, as such, was an American invention. There were parish (parochial) libraries open in Anglican churches all over the American colonies. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, founded in 1701, subsidized libraries as a regular part of their missionary activity whenever they sent a priest to an Anglican mission or church that did not have a library already.Humphreys, David, An Historical Account of the Incorporated Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, Joseph Downing, 1730, p. 72 There would thus have been parish libraries at the 289 Anglican churches, and at various missions.Purvis, Thomas L., Colonial America To 1763, Infobase Publishing, 1999, p. 181, Table 7.3 Bates Hall reading room in the Boston Public Library. Trinidad, Colorado. According to Edmund Farwell Slafter, the first public library was founded in Boston by the Rev. John Checkley at the Old State House sometime between 1711 when Boston's Old State House was built, and 1725.Slafter, Edmund Farwell, John Checkley, Or, The Evolution of Religious Tolerance in Massachusetts Bay: Including Mr. Checkley's Controversial Writings, His Letters and Other Papers, Prince Society, 1897, Volume 1, pp. 76-77, and Volume 2, p. 176. In a letter to the Rev. Dr. Thomas Bennet, dated June 15, 1725, Checkley wrote: :\\"In a short Time I propose to send you an account of the charitable Society of the Church of England, and of the public Library erected here: the laying the Foundation of both which, I have been (thanks to my good God) the happy tho' unworthy Instrument.\\" The library was destroyed when the Old State House interior was consumed by fire on December 9, 1747, when many books, papers, and records were destroyed. There is evidence of other and possibly earlier public libraries. The Rev. John Sharpe, who had traveled as a missionary priest over the colonies from Maryland to Connecticut, thought the parish library in New York inadequate. He devised an advanced plan for a public library in New York City open to all. In a letter on March 11, 1713 he notes there were already at least four public libraries in the colonies including the one in Boston: :\\"Another thing which is very much wanted here is a public Library, which would very much advance both learning and piety. Such there are at Charles Town in Carolina, Annapolis in Mary Land, at Philadelphia and Boston. Some books have been formerly sent to New York but as parochial they remain in the hands of the Incumbent.\\"Keep, Austin Baxter, History of the New York society library, with an introductory chapter on libraries in colonial New York, 1698-1776, Printed for the Trustees by the De Vinne Press, 1908, pp. 52-29. He proposed the institution should be \\"publick and provincial\\" and \\"open every day in the week at convenient hours,\\" when \\"all men may have liberty to read in the Library.\\" Just before returning to England in 1713 after a decade spent as a missionary priest in America, he left behind 238 of his volumes to be \\"given for the laying of a foundation of a Public Library.\\" However, it wasn't until thirty years after Sharp left America that a dozen men in 1754 founded the New York Society Library with Sharp's books as its core. His advanced dream of a library open every day was not to be accomplished in New York until 1791. In 1729, New York City formed its first public library. It was started with a donation of books from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The Collection of Dr. Millington was presented for the library. Most but not all works were in relation to religion. In 1731, Benjamin Franklin and the other members of the discussion club the Junto founded the Library Company of Philadelphia partly as a means to settle arguments and partly as a means to advance themselves through sharing information. Franklin's subscription library allowed members to buy \\"shares\\" and combined funds were used to buy more books; in return, members could borrow books and use the library. Today, the Library Company continues to exist as a nonprofit, independent research library. A town in Massachusetts named itself Franklin after the famous Pennsylvanian. For this honor, Franklin donated 116 books to the town in lieu of a requested church bell. Franklin's town meeting voted to lend the books to all Franklin inhabitants free of charge in 1790, and this small collection can therefore be considered the first public library in the United States and is now known as the Franklin Public Library. Dr. Jesse Torrey, Jr., of New Lebanon, New York, was one of the earliest advocates for free public libraries. In 1804 at the age of seventeen, he established the New Lebanon Juvenile Society for the Acquisition of Knowledge. The social library operated under a suggested user fee and was open to any youth between the ages of twelve and twenty-one. In 1817, Torrey published The Intellectual Torch, a treatise advocating for a national system of free public libraries. Torrey's plan included a tax on the import and export of alcohol to support local free schools and libraries. Peterborough Town Library, the first completely tax-supported public library in the United States, Peterborough, New Hampshire The first free public library supported by taxation in the world was the Peterborough, New Hampshire Town Library which was founded at town meeting on April 9, 1833. Many sources claim to have been the first, such as Boston's Public Library, which was the second, established in 1852. The Boston Public Library opened on March 20, 1854.http://lgdata.s3-website-us- east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/1431/1582920/history_of_urban_main_library_service.pdf The first free continuous children's library in the United States was funded privately, founded in 1835 in Arlington, Massachusetts. New York lawyer, governor and bibliophile Samuel J. Tilden bequeathed millions to build the New York Public Library. He believed Americans should have access to books and a free education if desired. In 1902, one account suggested \\"the village library is growing more and more an indispensable adjunct to American village life.\\" The public library in Summit, New Jersey Libraries have been started with wills from other benefactors. For example, the Bacon Free Library in South Natick, Massachusetts, was founded in 1881 after a benefactor left $15,000 in a will; it has operated as a public library since then. Women's clubs in the late 1880s and early 1900s supported the creation of libraries in their communities. Once the idea of the public library as an agency worthy of taxation was broadly established during the 19th and early 20th centuries, librarians through actions of the American Library Association and its division devoted to public libraries, the Public Library Association, sought ways to identify standards and guidelines to ensure quality service. Legislation such as the Library Services Act and the Library Services and Construction Act ensured that unserved areas and unserved groups would have access to library services.Holley, Edward G., and Robert Schremser. 1983. The Library Services and Construction Act: An Historical Overview from the Viewpoint of Major Participants. Greenwich, CT: JAI Press. A \\"school district public library\\" is a type of public library with a service district overlapping a school district. Votes related to library governance and funding, as well as the collection of levied taxes, are administered by the school district. In 2009, with the Great Recession, many public libraries had budget shortfalls. The library in Darby, Pennsylvania, found expenses were greater than revenues from local property taxes, state funds, and investment income; it was on the risk of closing, according to a newspaper report. =Changing roles of libraries= The former Williams Free Library in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin features an architectural style called Richardsonian Romanesque. In many towns and small cities before 1900, local boosters operated social libraries, which were open by subscription. The middle classes patronized them, borrowed bestsellers and old classics, and came to know the other book lovers in town. These libraries became the forerunners of the public library.Patrick M. Valentine, \\"America's Antebellum Social Libraries: A Reappraisal in Institutional Development,\\" Library & Information History (2011) 27#1 pp 32-51 Butte, Montana was perhaps the largest, richest and rowdiest mining camp in the American West. City boosters opened a public library in 1893. Ring argues that the library was originally a mechanism of social control, \\"an antidote to the miners' proclivity for drinking, whoring, and gambling.\\" It was also designed to promote middle-class values and to convince Easterners that Butte was a cultivated city.Daniel F. Ring, \\"The Origins of the Butte Public Library: Some Further Thoughts on Public Library Development in the State of Montana,\\" Libraries & Culture (1993) 28#4 pp 430-44 in JSTOR Quite apart from the Wild West, civic boosters hailed the opening of a public library as a landmark in their upward march of civilization and civility.Peter Dobkin Hall, \\"'To Make Us Bold and Learn to Read‚ÄîTo Be Friends to Each Other, and Friends to the World': Libraries and the Origins of Civil Society in the United States,\\" in Donald G. Davis Jr., ed., Libraries and Philanthropy (Austin: Graduate School of Library and Information Science, University of Texas, 1998). Chicago Public Library, 1991 As VanSlyck (1989) shows, the last years of the 19th century saw acceptance of the idea that libraries should be available to the American public free of charge. However the design of the idealized free library was at the center of a prolonged and heated debate. On one hand, wealthy philanthropists favored grandiose monuments that reinforced the paternalistic metaphor and enhanced civic pride. They wanted a grandiose showcase that created a grand vista through a double-height, alcoved bookhall with domestically-scaled reading rooms, perhaps dominated by the donor's portrait over the fireplace. Typical examples were the New York Public Library and the Chicago Public Library. Librarians considered that grand design inefficient, and too expensive to maintain.Abigail A. van Slyck, \\"The Utmost Amount of Effectiv [sic] Accommodation\\": Andrew Carnegie and the Reform of the American Library,\\" Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians (1991) 50#4 pp. 359-383 in JSTOR The Brumback Library in Van Wert, Ohio claims to be the first county library in US. Melvil Dewey instituted a traveling library system for upstate New York in 1892. The idea spread rapidly in the North. By 1898 there were over a hundred traveling libraries in Wisconsin alone, 534 in New York.  Public Library Service Responses  In 2007, the Public Library Association outlined the following eighteen public library service responses. These service responses are not comprehensive, but rather demonstrate the kinds of services public libraries most commonly provide:Garcia, J. and Nelson, S.

Chicago : ALA Neal-Schuman. =Carnegie libraries= Andrew Carnegie, born to poverty taught himself and became a leading industrialist and philanthropist. Among his many philanthropies was the public library‚Äîhe built and furnished a library if the city agreed to maintain and staff it. He gave over $60 million, which was a vast fortune in 20th-century dollars. Carnegie envisioned that libraries would \\"bring books and information to all people.\\" A total of 2,509 Carnegie libraries were built between 1883 and 1929, including some belonging to universities. 1,689 were built in the United States, 660 in Britain and Ireland, 125 in Canada, and others in Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere. By 1930, half the American public libraries had been built by Carnegie.Theodore Jones, Carnegie Libraries Across America: A Public Legacy (1997) Carnegie was attached to free libraries since his days as a young messenger-boy in Pittsburgh, when each Saturday he borrowed a new book from one. Carnegie systematically funded 2,507 libraries throughout the English- speaking world. James Bertram, Carnegie's chief aide from 1894 to 1914 administered the library program, issued guidelines and instituted an architectural review process.Peter Mickelson, \\"American Society and the Public Library in the Thought of Andrew Carnegie.\\" Journal of Library History (1975) 10#2 pp 117-138. Between 1886 and 1917, Carnegie reformed both library philanthropy and library design, encouraging a closer correspondence between the two. The Carnegie buildings typically followed a standardized style called \\"Carnegie Classic\\": a rectangular, T-shaped or L-shaped structure of stone or brick, with rusticated stone foundations and low-pitched, hipped roofs, with space allocated by function and efficiency. His libraries served not only as free circulating collections of books, magazines and newspapers, but also provided classrooms for growing school districts, Red Cross stations, and public meeting spaces, not to mention permanent jobs for the graduates of newly formed library schools. Academic libraries were built for 108 colleges. Usually there was no charge to read or borrow; in New Zealand, however, local taxes were too low to support libraries and most charged subscription fees to their users. The arrangements were always the same: Carnegie would provide the funds for the building but only after the municipal government had provided a site for the building and had passed an ordinance for the purchase of books and future maintenance of the library through taxation. This policy was in accord with Carnegie's philosophy that the dispensation of wealth for the benefit of society must never be in the form of free charity but rather must be as a buttress to the community's responsibility for its own welfare. In 1901, Carnegie offered to donate $100,000 to the city of Richmond, Virginia, for a public library. The city council had to furnish a site for the building and guarantee that $10,000 in municipal funds would be budgeted for the library each year. Despite the support from the majority of Richmond's civic leaders, the city council rejected Carnegie's offer. A combination of aversion to new taxes, fear of modernization, and fear that Carnegie might require the city to admit black patrons to his library account for the local government's refusal.Carolyn H. Leatherman, \\"Richmond Considers a Free Public Library: Andrew Carnegie's Offer of 1901.\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 1988 96(2): 181-192. A Richmond Public Library did open in 1924 with alternative sources of funding.\\"On October 13th, 1924, after more than 20 years of effort, a group of civic activists opened the Richmond Public Library. The late Major Lewis Ginter's former home at 901 West Franklin Street served as the first location. By 1930 a new art deco building had been constructed on Franklin Street between 1st and 2nd and was named the Dooley Library for Mrs. Sallie May Dooley whose will contained both $500,000 for the library \\" In a municipal election in 1904 union leaders in Wheeling, West Virginia, blocked the acceptance of a Carnegie library. The Detroit Library subsisted on library fines and inadequate city funds; Carnegie offered $750,000 in 1901 but was turned down because it was \\"tainted money\\"; after nine more years of underfunding Detroit took the money. Canada The Toronto Reference Library, centrepiece of the Toronto Public Library system The new Halifax Central Library. Young girl reading a book, Central Circulating Library at College and St. George Streets, Toronto, Ontario, circa 1930-1960. In 1779 Governor Frederick Haldimand founded the first subscription library in Qu√©bec City, Canada. Canada's small libraries were mostly held by rich families or religious institutions, and the general public was not admitted. \\"Haldimand's library, like other subscription libraries, appealed primarily to an urban elite\\",McNally, Peter F. 1996. \\"Deja vu: cuts to public libraries threaten a return to \\"gentleman's\\" past.\\" Quill & Quire. Volume 62, Issue 4, p. 8 Haldimand's library later merged with the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec (established in 1824), which displays the original Qu√©bec Library collection within its library. This and similar association/social libraries were examples of early prototypes of public libraries. They were public in that membership was allowed regardless of class or religion, and many in Canada eventually evolved into free public libraries. \\"Subsequently legislative collections were established in 1791 in Upper and in 1792 in Lower Canada; and in 1796 the first public library was founded in Montreal. In 1800, libraries were established in King's College, Nova Scotia, and at Niagara-on- the-Lake, where the first public library in Upper Canada operated for twenty years, in spite of losses during the War of 1812.\\". In Saint John, New Brunswick in 1883, following the efforts of Colonel James Domville in procuring a collection of materials to replace the many private collections lost in the Great Fire of Saint John, New Brunswick the first free, tax- supported public library was established. Guelph, Ontario and Toronto, Ontario opened public libraries that same year as well. Due to Canada's size and diversity, the development of the modern Canadian public library was more of a slow evolution than a quick transition as each of the provinces' specific conditions (geographic, economic, cultural, demographic, etc.) had first to be addressed. The public library therefore took on many forms in Canada's earlier years; the three most prevalent of these forms were school-district libraries, Mechanics Institutes, and association/social libraries (see reference to Literary and Historical Society of Quebec above). In 1850, school-district libraries were initiated in Canada. Public servant Joseph Howe started one in Nova Scotia, and politician Egerton Ryerson started one in Ontario. New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island followed suit in 1858 and 1877, respectively. The hope was that both children and adults could benefit from the local school authorities, where financial assistance was provided from colonial legislatures, but the departments of education proved to be too centralizing for locals and this practiced was phased out. Mechanics Institutes also contained libraries that the working class could access inexpensively. The first Canadian library of its kind was established in 1828 in Montr√©al, Qu√©bec. Other communities took up this idea as well ‚Äì notably those in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Hamilton, Ontario, Toronto, Ontario and Victoria, British Columbia. Like the school-district libraries, these institutes eventually ceased or were replaced by public libraries. The public library that opened in Toronto, Ontario, was mostly due to a campaign by city alderman John Hallam. James Bain became the first chief librarian, and built a comprehensive collection of Canadian literature and history. The Toronto Public Library was one of the first libraries to choose free status, and it was the largest of them all. Its development flourished after 1900 when Carnegie grants began to aid in building construction and the expansion of collections and services. During this time, open access and children's departments were introduced, and standard cataloguing and classification systems were adopted. Many of the original branches, funded by a Carnegie grant, still stand and continue to be operated by the Toronto Public Library. Other provinces were affected by Carnegie as well and followed Ontario's lead in legislating tax support for library services. British Columbia acted in 1891, Manitoba in 1899, Saskatchewan in 1906, and in Alberta, the first legislation officially passed by the legislative assembly was the Library Act. The act was passed March 15, 1907. The next provinces to follow were New Brunswick in 1929, Newfoundland in 1935, Prince Edward Island in 1936, Nova Scotia in 1937, Qu√©bec in 1959, and then the Northwest Territories in 1966. As they stand today, public libraries in Canada are \\"governed by provincial statutes and are primarily financed by municipal tax revenues and other local income, with provincial grants supplementing local funding. [They are also] the responsibility of a local or regional library board with authority to appoint or dismiss employees, control library property, establish policies, and budget for library operations.\\" Though the services offered vary from local branch to local branch, public libraries in Canada are not only places to read and borrow books; they are also hubs of community services, such as early reading programs, computer access, and tutoring and literacy help for children and adults. Throughout the years, Canadian libraries have been subject to the political and economic influence of the nation. During World War II, public libraries experienced development setbacks, but expansion resumed in 1945. Then, in the 1960s, Canadian public libraries felt the benefits of the era's emphasis on education ‚Äì service expanded, buildings were remodeled or constructed from scratch, and Centennial grants were provided in order to improve the system. This period of growth ended in due to the inflationary period in the 1970s and the two recessions during the 1980s. However, in the late 1990s this trend reversed and the National Core Library Statistics Program reported in 1999 that public libraries served 28.5 million municipal residents ‚Äì a total of 93% of the Canadian population.Schrader, Alvin M. and Brundin, Michael R. 2002. \\"National Core Library Statistics Program Statistical Report, 1999: Cultural and Economic Impact of Libraries on Canada.\\" p.15 Nevertheless, in 2011 the tides turned for public libraries in Canada once again, specifically in Toronto. The city is now undergoing a heated debate regarding Mayor Rob Ford's proposed budget cuts for the Toronto Public Library, which is currently one of the most efficient public library systems in all of North America.Thompson, Jim. 2011. Mexico The Biblioteca Palafoxiana in Puebla, Mexico, is the oldest public library in the Western Hemisphere, as well as one of the most beautiful. In 1640, the Bishop of Puebla, Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, donated 5,000 books from his private collection to the seminary of the Colegio de San Juan with the condition that the books be available to anyone who could read, and not just academics, thus creating the first public library in North America. In 2005, UNESCO added it to the Memory of the World Programme list. See also * Public libraries for Britain and the rest of the world Further reading *Dawson, Robert. (2014).

Later he was a deputy from 1819 to 1824. Early years Charles Joseph Mathieu Lambrechts was born in Sint-Truiden, Belgium, on 20 November 1753. His father was Gilles de Lambrechts, a colonel in the army of the States General of the Netherlands. He studied civil and canon law at Leuven. He graduated in 1774, became a professor in 1777 and a doctor in 1782. He was elected rector of the university in 1786. In the year 1778 he was initiated to the Lodge The True and Perfect Harmony of Mons.Paul Duchaine, La franc-ma√ßonnerie belge au XVIIIe si√®cle, Brussels, 1911, p. 103: \\" dans la suite plusieurs professeurs (de Louvain) et plusieurs √©tudiants se firent encore initier aux myst√®res ma√ßonniques, Fery (N.

In 1788 the Emperor Joseph II charged Lambrechts with visiting the universities of Germany. The goal was for him to study legal education in Germany with the promise that when he returned he would be given the chair of public law and international law in Leuven. The Brabant Revolution (January 1789 ‚Äì December 1790) upset this plan. Lambrechts sided with the emperor, left Belgium, and only returned after the restoration of imperial authority. In 1793 he established himself in Brussels to practice as an attorney. French Revolution Lambrechts declared himself a supporter of the Revolution after the French entered Belgium. He became a municipal officer in Brussels, a member of the central government, then President of the central administration of the Department of Dyle. In 1797, the French Directory appointed him to replace Merlin de Douai at the Ministry of Justice. He held this position from 3 Vend√©miaire VI (24 Septembre 1797) to 3 Messidor VIII (22 June 1800). He was a candidate to become a Director when Emmanuel Joseph Siey√®s was chosen in place of Jean-Fran√ßois Rewbell. In January 1798 Lambrechts defined the principles that would be followed in the territories occupied by the French armies, writing that servitude was accompanied by ignorance, and freedom could only come when the people were enlightened. They must therefore learn French in school so they could become virtuous citizens. After the coup of 18 Brumaire VIII (9 November 1799) when the French Consulate came to power Lambrechts was made a member of the S√©nat conservateur. He was appointed to the Senate on 3 Niv√¥se VIII (24 December 1799). Empire Lambrechts spoke out against Napoleon Bonaparte's accumulation of power, and was one of three senators who voted against establishment of the empire. Despite this, he was appointed a member of the Legion of Honour on 9 Vend√©miaire XII (2 October 1803) and was created Count of the Empire on 13 May 1808. In 1814 Lambrechts was at the head of the minority, and wrote the preamble to the act of deposition of Napoleon. He was a member of the commission to prepare a new constitution. However, King Louis XVIII of France refused to sanction it. Lambrechts refused to give his oath to the emperor during the Hundred Days. He retired to private life during the Hundred Days, and did not return to politics until 1819, after the second Bourbon Restoration. Bourbon Restoration On 11 September 1819 Lambrechts was elected to the chamber of deputies for two departments. His health prevented him from appearing except on rare occasions. Lambrechts died on 4 August 1825. He left part of his fortune to various charitable institutions.

It is a conversational agent that utilizes natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR) and Automatic Learning. Because the bot poses as a young female in order to entice and track potential predators, it became known in media as the \\"virtual Lolita\\", in reference to Vladimir Nabokov's novel.  Background  In 2013, the University of Deusto researchers published a paper on their work with Negobot and disclosed the text online. In their abstract, the researchers addressed the issue that an increasing number of children are using the internet and that these young users are more susceptible to existing internet risks. Their main objective was to create a chatterbot with the ability to trap online predators that posed a threat to children. They intended to deploy the bot into sites frequented by predators such as social networks and chatrooms. The university researchers used information provided by anti- pedophilia activist organization Perverted-Justice, including examples of online encounters and conversations with sexual predators, to supplement the program's artificial intelligence system.  Features  = Programmed persona = The chatterbot takes the guise of a naive and vulnerable 14-year- old girl. The bot's programmers used methods of artificial intelligence and natural language processing to create a conversational agent fluent in typical teenage slang, misspellings, and knowledge of pop culture. Through these linguistic features, the bot is able to mimic the conversational style of young teenagers. It also features split personalities and seven different patterns of conversation. Negobot's primary creator, Dr. Carlos Laorden, expressed the significance of the bot's distinguishable style of communication, stating that normally, \\"chatbots tend to be very predictable. Their behavior and interest in a conversation are flat, which is a problem when attempting to detect untrustworthy targets like paedophiles.\\" What makes Negobot different is its game theory feature, which makes it able to \\"maintain a much more realistic conversation.\\" Apart from being able to imitate a stereotypical teenager, the program is also able to translate messages into different languages. = Game theory = Negobot's designers programmed it with the ability to treat conversations with potential predators as if it were a game, the objective being to collect as much information on the suspect as possible that could provide evidence of pedophilic characteristics and motives. The use of game theory shapes the decisions the bot makes and the overall direction of the conversation. The bot initiates its undercover operations by entering a chat as a passive participant, waiting to be chatted by a user. Once a user elicits conversation, the bot will frame the conversation in such a way that keeps the target engaged, extracting personal information and discouraging it from leaving the chat. The information is then recorded to be potentially sent to the police. If the target seems to lose interest, the bot attempts to make it feel guilty by expressing sentiments of loneliness and emotional need through strategic, formulated responses, ultimately prolonging interaction. In addition, the bot may provide fake information about itself in attempt to lure the target into physical meetings. = Limitations = Despite being able to carry out a realistic conversation, Negobot is still unable to detect linguistic subtleties in the messages of others, including sarcasm.  Controversy  John Carr, a specialist in online child safety, expressed his concern to BBC over the legality of this undercover investigation. He claimed that using the bot on unsuspecting internet users could be considered a form of entrapment or harassment. The type of information that Negobot collects from potential online predators, he said, is unlikely to be upheld in court. Furthermore, he warned that relying on only software without any real-world policing risks enticing individuals to do or say things that they would not have if real-world policing were a factor.

It is situated at the intersection of Gammel K√∏ge Landevej with the Ring 3 motorway. It is now known s Aeronautisk Aktivitetscenter Aved√∏re (AAA) and used as a centre for vintage aircraft. The oldest buildings at the site are two wooden hangars that date from its establishment in 1917. History Aved√∏re Air Base was built for the Royal Danish Army's air squad in 1917. It originally covered an area of 500 by 500 metres and included runways and three hangars. One of the hangars was demolished in connection with an expansion of Gammel K√∏ge Landevej in the 1930s. Twelve Avro 504 aircraft were stationed at the air base but flying was limited due to shortage of fuel and spare parts during World War I. Shortly after the war, Det Danske Luftfartsselskab (later Scandinavian Airlines) used the airfield for its first civilian test flights. The Royal Danish Navy's air squad briefly operated out of Aved√∏re in 1921-23 before moving its activities to Kastrup. The premises were then taken over by the 6th Artillery Unit. The hangars were used for storage and the runways as a training ground. V√¶rl√∏se Air Base was inaugurated in 1934, shortly after the foundation of the Royal Danish Air Force. Aved√∏re Airfield was taken over by the occupying German Forces during World War II. The site was used for testing of bomber engines after repairs at A/S Nordwerk, a collaborationist company based in Copenhagen. The managing director of A/S Nordwerk was shot in 1945 a few kilometres from the airfield. After the war, the site was used as a storage facility by the Aved√∏relejren military installation and Hvidovre Municipality. There were plans to redevelop the site in the 1980s but it was instead decided to use it for recreational purposes. Aved√∏re Airfield was put up for sale by the government-owned property company Freja Ejendomme in December 2017. Buildings The northern of the two hangars from 1917 The two red painted hangars from 1917 were listed in 1976. They were constructed in timber so that they could easily be burned down in the event of war. The site also features an engine testing facility from 1943. Almost a hundred metres long, it consists of a row of 10 interconnected testing halls. A vintage aircraft from 1958 has been installed on the top of a column in front of the buildings. Activities The airfield is today used by various clubs associated with aircraft and aircraft history, collectively known as Aeronautisk Aktivitetscenter Aved√∏re (AAA). The hangars are used for restoration of vintage aircraft. The current runway opened in 2004. Aved√∏re Airfield also hosts an annual air show. The clubs arrange tours of the airfield.

The plant, originally occupied by Bell Aircraft, began operation in April 1943 and was intended specifically to produce B-29 Superfortresses under license from Boeing. During the course of the War, the factory produced 668 B-29s for the United States Army Air Forces, and at its peak had a work force of approximately 28,000. After the War the factory was mothballed, but with the United States's entrance into the Korean War, in January 1951 the plant was turned over to Lockheed who began refurbishing B-29s. The plant remains in use today by Lockheed.  History  Two weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Bell Aircraft of Buffalo, New York was selected to produce B-29 Superfortresses under license from Boeing. Bell had been founded in 1935 by Lawrence D. Bell, and at the time of the United States's entrance into the War, had a workforce of around 1,000. As the nation prepared to expand its military production, the Roosevelt Administration believed that it was important to situate aircraft plants inland, away from vulnerable coastal positions. Atlanta had a pre- existing airport ‚Äì Candler Field ‚Äì and extensive railroad network, and thus seemed a logical choice for a new factory. In September 1940 Roosevelt had appointed Marietta native Lucius D. Clay head of a large airport construction programme, which included Marietta's Rickenbacker Field. After Bell was given the B-29 contract, Clay, along with Cobb County officials lobbied the Government to award the new plant to Marietta over other Atlanta suburbs. On 19 February 1942 the Government announced that Marietta would be the site of the new factory. That same day the Government announced it was taking control of Rickenbacker Field, which it would rename Marietta Army Airfield B-29s in the main assembly building. Construction of the plant began on 30 March 1942. Located at the northwest corner of airstrip, the complex consisted of four main buildings: * B-1 ‚Äì main assembly * B-2 ‚Äì administration * B-3 ‚Äì hangar (armament assembly) * B-4 ‚Äì hangar (radio and radar assembly) On 15 April 1943 the plant officially opened, and the first Bell B-29 was flown on 4 November 1943. During the War the plant had a succession of four general managers: Captain Harry E. Collins, Omer Woodson, Carl Cover, and James V. Carmichael. At its peak in February 1945 the plant employed over 28,000 workers. Roughly 37 percent of the workforce was female, and 8 percent African American. During the War the factory was racially segregated. On 28 November 1944 Bob Hope gave a performance at the plant. By the summer of 1945 Bell began to scale back production and by the fall only had a couple thousand employees. In 1946 the factory was fully closed, after having produced a total of 668 B-29s. After closing, building B-1 was used for storage, while building B-2 was occupied by the Veterans' Administration. Two Marietta-built B-29s survive today: 44-84076, which is located at the Strategic Air Command and Aerospace Museum in Ashland, Nebraska, and 44-84053, which is located at the Museum of Aviation in Warner Robins, Georgia. In January 1951 the Government turned the plant over to Lockheed for the purpose of refurbishing B-29 to go into service in the Korean War. During the 1950s Lockheed also produced 394 B-47 Stratojets at the plant. Today the site is used for the fabrication and assembly of large aircraft.Shettle, M. L.

His eighteen years in office was the longest until Mayor \\"Buddy\\" Cianci, over 100 years later. Early life Thomas Arthur Doyle was born March 15, 1827 in Providence, Rhode Island to Thomas Doyle and Martha Jones. The family was of Irish Protestant heritage. He was one of seven children, among them his sister, educator and reformer Sarah Doyle. Their father died when Thomas was young. He attended Elm Street Grammar School, a public school. At age 14 he joined the counting-room of Benjamin Cozzens Esq., a lawyer, manufacturer, and calico printer. Doyle clerked there and at a few other jobs, including cashier, stockbroker, and real estate auctioneer. Political career Doyle began his political career in 1848, aged 21, when he was elected ward clerk for the Sixth Ward. In 1852 he was elected to the common council from the Fifth Ward. Doyle also served on the school committee, at one time being the youngest member of the committee. Tenure as mayor Engraving Doyle is considered by some historians and even was regarded in his lifetime to have been one of Providence's greatest mayors. During his tenure Providence grew from \\"a large manufacturing village\\" to a \\"little metropolis\\". Doyle was instrumental in leading Providence to become a modern city. Doyle was known for his individuality. He had a reputation for being straightforward and opinionated. At one time or another he alienated everyone from Democrats to Republicans to taxpayers to the press to city departments, often advocating unpopular policies. His relationship with the city council was often stormy; they were said to be in \\"hearty disagreement on almost everything\\" and he often exercised the veto power. He spent a lot of money, increased debt, and raised taxes. Yet he earned respect for being honest and running an administration free from corruption. Some specific achievements of his terms of office included: * Construction of Providence City Hall was completed in 1878 * Introduction of a uniformed police force, which became a model for other cities * Introduction of a fire alarm signal system in December 1870 * Construction of a municipal water system which drew water from the Pawtuxet River was introduced in December 1870 * A comprehensive sewer system, which emptied into the river and harbor, was begun in 1872 * The school system was improved and expanded, and many schoolhouses built, including the high school in 1878 * Acquisition of Roger Williams Park through donation (1871) * The city population grew from 54,000 to 120,000 * The city took on large amounts of debt * Doyle began a complete makeover of railroad approaches to Providence, including eliminating grade crossings and constructing a much larger Union Station. These efforts were not completed until after Doyle's death. Personal life In 1869, he married Almyra Sprague, sister of Senator William Sprague. They had no children. His house at 137 Chestnut Street, Providence, stands today. Doyle was a member of the Unitarian church. He was also an enthusiastic Mason. He was made a Master Mason in 1857, and was elected to various statewide Mason offices including Knights Templar. Death, memorial, and burial Providence City Hall was decorated for Doyle's public wake This bronze Statue of Thomas A. Doyle, originally installed at Cathedral Square, was moved to the corner of Chestnut and Broad Street in 1967.Doyle suffered a stroke on the evening of June 6, 1886, while still in office. The \\"entire right side of his body\\" was reportedly paralyzed. He died at his house on Wednesday June 9, 1886. On Saturday the 12th, his body was escorted by the First Light Infantry from his home to City Hall, where he lie in state. Thousands of people came to the City Hall to silently pay their respects. Doyle is believed to be the last mayor to be honored with a wake at City Hall until Buddy Cianci, 130 years later. Gilbert F. Robbins was named acting mayor, and he issued a proclamation that on the following Monday June 14, all business in the city should be closed from noon to 3:00 PM. On that day a large procession carried his body from City Hall to the First Unitarian Church for services, then on to Swan Point Cemetery for burial. Recognition * A statue of Doyle by Henry Hudson Kitson was erected in 1889 in Cathedral Square, near the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul. It was moved in 1967 to the intersection of Broad and Chestnut Street. * Doyle Avenue, on Providence's East Side, was named for him. * Doyle was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 2004.

A member of the Komische Oper Berlin and later the Staatsoper Unter den Linden, he made award-winning recordings and appeared as a guest internationally. He has been an academic voice teacher in Berlin and Hamburg.  Career  Born in East Berlin, Lorenz studied voice in his hometown at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik \\"Hanns Eisler\\" from 1964 to 1969, where he was a master student of Alois Orth. After receiving several prizes at international singing competitions, Lorenz was engaged as a lyrical baritone at the Komische Oper Berlin by Walter Felsenstein in 1969. In 1973, he became the first vocal soloist at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, a position which Kurt Masur created for him. He performed and recorded several cantatas by Johann Sebastian Bach and became known as a Lied singer. His recordings of songs by Franz Schubert received several awards. From 1978 to 1992, Lorenz was first lyrical baritone at the Staatsoper Berlin in Berlin. He appeared successfully as Wolfram in Wagner's Tannh√§user, as the Count in Mozart's Die Hochzeit des Figaro, as Posa in Verdi's Don Carlos, and as Borromeo in Hans Pfitzner's Palestrina, among others. He recorded Mahler's Kindertotenlieder with the Gewandhausorchester and Masur, and Schubert song cycles with pianist Norman Shetler. English music critic Alan Blyth reviewed Die Winterreise for Gramophone and noted: \\"He sings with pleasing, consistently firm tone and with an enviable control of line and dynamics. The range of his voice is not so large as Fischer-Dieskau's, a singer from whom he has learnt so much, but within its smaller compass he can achieve almost the same power and intensity.\\" Recordings of Schubert songs between 1974 and 1987 were combined to form a collection covering 151 of his songs. A reviewer wrote that Lorenz \\"penetrated Schubert's songs for many years and this eight-CD box is the result of assiduous study and a long-term plan\\". Lorenz recorded the role of Beckmesser in Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, alongside Ben Heppner, Cheryl Studer and Bernd Weikl, conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch, Bach's solo cantatas for bass Ich will den Kreuzstab gerne tragen and Ich habe genug with the Neues Bachisches Collegium Musicum conducted by Max Pommer, Mahlers's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen conducted by G√ºnther Herbig, and his F√ºnf Lieder nach Friedrich R√ºckert with the Staatskapelle Berlin conducted by Otmar Suitner. Lorenz performed as a guest in Europe, the US and Japan. In 1976, he was awarded the Kunstpreis, and in 1983 the National Prize of the German Democratic Republic. In 1979, he was appointed Kammers√§nger of the Staatsoper in Berlin, and in 1982 professor. From 2001 to 2003, he was professor of voice at the Musikhochschule Hamburg, and from October 2003 at the Universit√§t der K√ºnste Berlin.

The setting of the chanson almost certainly corresponds to the period 919‚Äì37 in Breton history, when the Normans (Vikings newly settled in northern France) persistently raided Brittany. It conflates Saracens (Sarrasin) and Arabs (Arabis) with Normans (Norois), and places Aiquin's origins in the north country (Nort pais). It also turns Roland, the Frankish hero of the earlier Chanson de Roland, into a native Breton. Inspired by Aiquin, the family of the famous French soldier Bertrand du Guesclin (died 1380) claimed to descend from the Saracen king.

The Economist referred to BLOCK71 as the heart of Singapore's technology start-up ecosystem and the world's most tightly packed entrepreneurial ecosystem. BLOCK71 has built up a strong innovation and entrepreneurship community, where entrepreneurs, investors, developers and mentors within the interactive digital media space are in close proximity to each other. BLOCK71 is home to more than 100 start-ups, venture capital firms and tech incubators. It is also located near other technology hubs within Singapore, including the Fusionopolis, Biopolis and National University of Singapore (NUS). History The Ayer Rajah Industrial Estate was built in the 1970s by the Jurong Town Corporation, as a series of flatted factories for manufacturing-based activities. A few blocks within this industrial estate, including BLOCK71, were initially planned for demolition. However, in 2011, NUS Enterprise, the Media Development Authority and SingTel Innov8 collaborated to turn Blk71 into a start-up hub, by setting up a strategic incubation programme at BLOCK71, known as Plug-In@Blk71. The intention was to pull together the interactive digital media/ info-communications start-up cluster, which was previously dispersed around Singapore, to one common location, for increased synergy and economies of scale. With this development, BLOCK71 rapidly transformed from an old, deserted industrial estate into a thriving start-up hub. Early 2015, Infocomm Investment, the investment arm of the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore inaugurated the extension of Blk71 to neighboring Blk79 (dubbed BASH for Build Amazing Startups Here), which is also a refurbished industrial estate. A third and last unit, Blk73, designed for smaller startups, is being built up and should open in 2015. Plug-In@Blk71 Plug-In@Blk71 is an incubation programme that provides start-ups in the interactive digital media space access to resources needed to effectively develop and market their solutions. It is set up by NUS Enterprise, the Media Development Authority and SingTel Innov8. Managed by NUS Enterprise, Plug-In@Blk71 provides a common platform for entrepreneurs and stakeholders to meet, connect and accelerate the growth of ideas and start- ups. Since 2011, a strong start-up community has been established at Plug- In@Blk71, where people regularly share contacts, ideas and success stories, which has allowed the start-up scene to grow rapidly. Start-ups are given 24-hour access to Plug-In@Blk71. Located on level 2 of Blk71, Plug-In@Blk71 provides hot-desking space for entrepreneurs to work on their ideas. There are some 30 entrepreneurs/ start-ups/ business ideas located at the hot-desking space each month, which typically stay there for several weeks up to a few months. Plug-In@Blk71 has shared resources, including meeting rooms, a large seminar room, free internet access, pantry supplies and office equipment. Regular entrepreneurial events are organised at Plug-In@Blk71 for the entrepreneurial community. There are approximately 3-5 events organised each week, including mentoring sessions, business clinics, VC pitching sessions, industrial sharing seminars and networking events. Start-ups The companies based at Blk71 are typically technology start-ups. The majority of them are within the interactive digital media space, including Stream Media, which develops a mobile in-app payment platform, travelmob, which provides an online market place for vacation rentals across Asia, Daylight Studios, a mobile game developer and Appknox, a mobile security company. However, there are also a few hardware tech companies, such as Zimplistic, which is developing the world‚Äôs first automatic roti-maker and T.Ware, which is developing a wearable technology that provides deep pressure to calm autistic children. Incubators, Accelerators and Investors There are approximately 30 organisations located at Blk71 that provide a range of funding and in-kind support, including angel investment, seed funding, series A, B and beyond. These include NUS Enterprise (which manages Plug-In@Blk71 as well as has additional incubation space on levels 1 and 3), and JFDI.Asia.

Through its command of the sea, financial subsidies to allies on the European mainland, and active military intervention in the Peninsular War, Britain played the central role in Napoleon's downfall even as all the other major powers switched back and forth. Overview With the execution of King Louis XVI in 1793, the French Revolution became a contest of ideologies between the conservative, royalist Kingdom of Great Britain and radical Republican France.Roger Knight, Britain against Napoleon: The Organization of Victory, 1793‚Äì1815 (2013) pp 61‚Äì62. Napoleon, who came to power in 1799, threatened invasion of Great Britain itself, and with it, a fate similar to the countries of continental Europe that his armies had overrun. The Napoleonic Wars were therefore ones in which the British invested all the moneys and energies it could raise. French ports were blockaded by the Royal Navy.David Andress, The Savage Storm: Britain on the Brink in the Age of Napoleon (2012)Brendan Simms, \\"Britain and Napoleon,\\" Historical Journal (1998) 41#3 pp. 885‚Äì94 in JSTOR In 1803 the Kingdom of Great Britain was renamed the United Kingdom after absorbing Ireland. After a relatively peaceful period from 1801-1803 (during which the Royal Navy supplied material and naval support to Haitian rebels fighting Napoleon's forces in the Caribbean), war in Europe began again. Napoleon's plans to invade Britain failed due to the inferiority of his navy, and in 1805, Lord Nelson's fleet decisively defeated the French and Spanish at the Battle of Trafalgar, which was the last significant naval action of the Napoleonic Wars. Battle of Trafalgar The series of naval and colonial conflicts, including a large number of minor naval actions, resembled those of the French Revolutionary Wars and the preceding centuries of European warfare. Conflicts in the Caribbean, and in particular the seizure of colonial bases and islands throughout the wars, could potentially have some effect upon the European conflict. The Napoleonic conflict had reached the point at which subsequent historians could talk of a \\"world war\\". Only the Seven Years' War offered a precedent for widespread conflict on such a scale. Napoleon also attempted economic warfare against Britain, especially in the Berlin Decree of 1806. It forbade the import of British goods into European countries allied with or dependent upon France, and installed the Continental System in Europe. All connections were to be cut, even the mail. British merchants smuggled in many goods and the Continental System was not a powerful weapon of economic war.Paul W. Schroeder, The Transformation of European Politics 1763‚Äì1848 (1994) pp 305-10 There was some damage to Britain, especially in 1808 and 1811, but its control of the oceans helped ameliorate the damage. Even more damage was done to the economies of France and its allies, which lost a useful trading partner.Alexander Grab, Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe (2003) pp 29-33 Angry governments gained an incentive to ignore the Continental System, which led to the weakening of Napoleon's coalition.Fran√ßois Crouzet, \\"Wars, blockade, and economic change in Europe, 1792‚Äì1815.\\" Journal of Economic History (1964) 24#4 pp 567-588 in JSTOR. The British army remained a minimal threat to France; the British standing army of just 220,000 at the height of the Napoleonic Wars hardly compared to France's army of a million men‚Äîin addition to the armies of numerous allies and several hundred thousand national guardsmen that Napoleon could draft into the military if necessary. Although the Royal Navy effectively disrupted France's extra-continental trade‚Äîboth by seizing and threatening French shipping and by seizing French colonial possessions‚Äîit could do nothing about France's trade with the major continental economies and posed little threat to French territory in Europe. In addition, France's population and agricultural capacity far outstripped that of Britain. Many in the French government believed that isolating Britain from the Continent would end its economic influence over Europe and isolate it. Though the French designed the Continental System to achieve this, it never succeeded in its objective. Britain possessed the greatest industrial capacity in Europe, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength through trade to its possessions from its rapidly expanding new Empire. Britain's command of the sea meant that France could never enjoy the peace necessary to consolidate its control over Europe, and it could threaten neither the home islands nor the main British colonies. Battle of Waterloo Sideshows like the Gunboat War against Denmark, the Walcheren Campaign against the Netherlands and the War of 1812 against the United States could not hurt Napoleon, but the Spanish uprising of 1808 at last permitted Britain to gain a foothold on the Continent. The Duke of Wellington and his army of British and Portuguese gradually pushed the French out of Spain and in early 1814, as Napoleon was being driven back in the east by the Prussians, Austrians, and Russians, Wellington invaded southern France. After Napoleon's surrender and exile to the island of Elba, peace appeared to have returned, but when he escaped back into France in 1815, the British and their allies had to fight him again. The armies of Wellington and Von Blucher defeated Napoleon once and for all at the Battle of Waterloo. =Civilian support network= Britain mobilized a vast civilian support network to support its soldiers. Historian Jenny Uglow (2015) explores a multitude of connections between the Army and its support network, as summarized by a review of her book by Christine Haynes: :a whole host of other civilian, actors, including: army contractors, who provided massive quantities of tents, knapsacks, canteens, uniforms, shoes, muskets, gunpowder, ships, maps, fortifications, meat, and biscuit; bankers and speculators, who funded the supplies as well as subsidies to Britain's allies...revenue agents, who collected the wide variety of taxes imposed to finance the wars; farmers, whose fortunes rose and fell not just with the weather but with the war; elites, who amidst war maintained many of the same old routines and amusements; workers, when the context of war found opportunities for new jobs and higher wages but also grievances that led to strikes and riots; and the poor, who suffered immensely through much of this....[And women who] participated in the war not just as relations of combatants but as sutlers, prostitutes, laundresses, spinners, bandage-makers, and drawing-room news- followers. Christine Haynes, Review, ‚Äò‚ÄôJournal of military history April 2016 80#2 p 544 Jenny Uglow, In These Times: Living in Britain Through Napoleon's Wars, 1793-1815 (2015) The British Empire at the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 =Financing the war= A key element in British success was its ability to mobilize the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France. With a population of 16 million Britain was barely half the size of France with 30 million. In terms of soldiers the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers ‚Äì economic change and military conflict from 1500 to 2000 (1989), pp. 128‚Äì9 Most important, the British national output remained strong and the well-organized business sector channeled products into what the military needed. The system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets. The British budget in 1814 reached ¬£66 million, including ¬£10 million for the Navy, ¬£40 million for the Army, ¬£10 million for the Allies, and ¬£38 million as interest on the national debt. The national debt soared to ¬£679 million, more than double the GDP. It was willingly supported by hundreds of thousands of investors and tax payers, despite the higher taxes on land and a new income tax. The whole cost of the war came to ¬£831 million. By contrast the French financial system was inadequate and Napoleon's forces had to rely in part on requisitions from conquered lands.Elie Halevy, A History of the English People in 1815 (1924) vol 2 p 205-6, 215-228Roger Knight, Britain Against Napoleon: The Organisation of Victory, 1793‚Äì1815 (2013)J.

San Joaquin is a rural town with a population of about 7,500 inhabitants, has some access roads in poor condition, its inhabitants have water pipes, however the supply is poor and not have all sanitation, a problem that has not been solved by government authorities, so many buy water. Beneath the land of that location has several wells with clean fresh water but not all have the resources to take it. The population is engaged in agriculture, animal husbandry and tourism despite its remote location far from the lake and is a popular destination on the eastern shore of the lake and the inhabitants of the neighboring villages because of their traditions. Probably named after the saint with the same name.  Vegetation Has landscape of dry forest and wet forest and compound relief, mainly of hills and ridges. The present town is the heir of Miranda Municipality entity comprising the same territory between 1884 and 1989. Etymology  San Joaquin is named after the saint with the same name because the inhabitants were devoted at that time. The town's origins are closely linked with the first settlements of slaves and peasants who worked on the neighboring estate; this population remained, in the last years of the colony, occupied in his farming and creating a small society of aristocrats, freedmen and slaves, where the names of the first thirteen settlers continue linked to the history of our people, through their descendants.

The scholar Ge Hong (283-343 CE) immortalized pu in his pen name Baopuzi \\"Master who Embraces Simplicity\\" and eponymous book Baopuzi. Terminology Pu can be written with either of the variant Chinese characters or , which are linguistically complex. =Characters= Both and are classified as radical- phonetic characters, combining the semantically significant \\"tree\\" radical (commonly used for writing names of trees and wooden objects) with the phonetic indicators pu or bu . The Chinese character pu was first recorded on Chinese bronze inscriptions from the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE), and the character pu was first recorded in Chinese classics from the Warring States period (475-221 BCE). When the People's Republic of China promulgated simplified Chinese characters in 1956, the established variant pu (with 6 strokes) was chosen to replace the traditional Chinese character pu (with 16 strokes). One of the two (c. 168 BCE) Mawangdui silk manuscript versions of the Daodejing, discovered in 1973 by archeologists excavating a tomb, uses a rare textual variant character for pu : w√≤ \\"a house tent (esp. with a wooden roof)\\", written with the \\"tree radical\\" and wu \\"room; house\\" phonetic. The \\"B\\" text, like the received version, uses pu 8 times in 6 chapters; the \\"A\\" text uses w√≤ 6 times in 4 chapters and has lacunae in chapters 19 and 57. The (c. 121 CE) Shuowen jiezi defines wo as muzhang \\"wood canopy\\", and the (early 3rd century) Guangya defines it as choumu \\"curtain; cover\\". These variant words p√∫ < *phr√¥k \\"unworked wood\\" and w√≤ < * î√¥k \\"house tent\\" are semantically and phonologically dissimilar. =Pronunciations and meanings= The comprehensive Chinese character dictionary Hanyu Da Zidian (1987: 2:1291, 2:1154) lists 2 pronunciations and 8 meanings for the character , and 6 pronunciations and 11 meanings for ; which are summarized below. The glyph can be read: *p«î #\\"unworked wood\\", #\\"cut down; fell trees\\" #\\"nature; essence; intrinsic quality\\" (compare English in the rough) #\\"simple; plain; unadorned; unaffected\\" #\\"(economics) net cost\\" *p√∫ #\\"grow thickly (of plants); shrub\\" #\\"an oak tree\\" #\\"attached; affixed\\" The glyph can be read to mean: *p«î #\\"unworked wood; natural; plain; etc.\\" (= p«î ) #\\"large\\" #\\"uncured meat\\" *p≈´ # \\"root; basis; origin\\" #\\"beat; hit; an instrument of torture\\" (= p≈´ ) *p√≤ #\\"tree bark; (esp.) magnolia bark\\" in houpo \\"Magnolia officinalis bark (used in Traditional Chinese medicine)\\" #in p√≤sh√π \\"Celtis sinensis, Chinese hackberry\\" *p≈ç #in p≈çdƒÅo \\"a kind of two-handed sword\\" *P√∫ #\\"a surname\\", namely Park (Korean surname) *Pi√°o # \\"a surname\\" The Erya, which is the oldest Chinese dictionary, defined pu and supu as \\"oak\\" names (in \\"Explaining Trees\\" chapter 14). First, pu is defined as bao (14:45). Guo Pu's Erya commentary identified this pu tree as yupu \\"Quercus acutissima, saw-tooth oak\\" (which occurs in the Shijing below). Bao is usually read fu \\"drumstick\\", and Guo noted this name bao denoted \\"a kind of oak [] that grew in clumps\\", and quotes the Shijing usage as baoli instead of baoli \\"bushy oak\\" (see below). The Bencao Gangmu says there are two varieties of hu \\"Quercus mongolica, Mongolian oak\\", the bao is small and grows in clumps while the li is tall and has large leaves. Second, supu is defined as xin \\"heart; mind\\" (14:64). Guo identifies supu (cf. reverse pusu in the Shijing below) as husu (with hu \\"Mongolian oak\\"), the \\"Quercus dentata, daimyo oak\\". While xin \\"heart; mind\\" is a common Chinese word, this Erya definition is the only known context in which it names a tree. The Yijing uses xin to mean \\"thorn; prick\\", (tr. Wilhelm 1967:277): \\"Among varieties of wood it means those which are firm and have much pith\\". The Shuowen Jiezi, the first Chinese dictionary of characters, simply defines pu as mupi \\"tree bark; wood with bark\\", and pu as musu \\"plain wood; unworked lumber\\" (later meaning \\"lignin\\" in scientific terminology). Returning to the central Daoist meaning of pu, Pas and Leung (1998:351) challenge the stereotyped \\"uncarved block\\" translation of pu: \\"The idea implied in it comes closer to \\"wholeness,\\" which is also contained in \\"uncarved block,\\" except that \\"uncarved block\\" has been reified. As a result, what was an excellent analogy of the Tao has become sterile and counterproductive.\\" Citing the pu translations of S√©raphin Couvreur (1890:475) \\"wood that has not been worked on; simple, without ornament, without disguise\\" and Bernhard Karlgren (1923:231) \\"wood in its natural state, not worked: rough, plain, natural, simple\\"; Pas and Leung conclude, \\"it is obvious where the expression \\"uncarved block\\" came from, but the addition of \\"block\\" is an interpretation. The term means \\"plain wood,\\" \\"uncarved wood.\\"\\" =Etymology= Reconstructions of Old Chinese pronunciations have transformed Chinese etymology. Old Chinese reconstructions of pu or bu include: *b√∫ < *p√ªk or *b'√ªk (Dong 1948) *b√∫ < *puk or *b'uk \\"shrubby trees\\", p≈≠ < *p'uk \\"rough; unadorned\\", and p√≤ < *p'«îk \\"trim unworked wood; robust, solid\\" (Karlgren 1957:312) *p√∫ < *phruk (Li 1971) *b√∫ < *puk or *buk (Zhou 1972) *p√∫ < *phr√¥k \\"to trim wood\\", \\"in a natural state, unworked\\" (Schuessler 2007:418) * p≈≠ < *p ∞À§rok \\"unworked wood\\" (Baxter and Sagart 2001:118) Victor Mair (1990:138) suggests that pu < *phluk \\"unhewn log\\" is \\"almost certainly related to the English word \\"block,\\" which probably derives from the Indo-European root bhelk (beam).\\" Axel Schuessler (2007:418) says the etymology of p√∫ < *phr√¥k \\"to trim wood\\" could either be an \\"aspirated iterative derivation\\" from bƒÅo < *pr√¥k \\"cut up, peel, pluck\\", or \\"belong to the homophonous etymon with the basic meaning 'in a natural state, unworked', as in p√∫ 'in a natural state', 'unworked precious stone'.\\" Early textual references Pu occurs in some of the earliest Chinese classics, frequently in Daoist ones. =Shijing= Two odes in the Shijing \\"Classic of Poetry\\" use pu compounds to mean \\"an oak\\". Pusu occurs in Ode 23: \\"scrubby oaks\\" (Legge 1879:34), \\"a clump of oaks\\" (Waley 1937:60), \\"low shrubby trees\\" (Karlgren 1950:13). The Mao commentary describes the pusu as a Â∞èÊú® \\"small tree\\". The Erya (above) writes this reversible compound as supu . Yupu is the name of Ode 238, which records using this tree for firewood: \\"the yih and the p'oh\\" (Legge 1879:442), \\"the oak clumps\\" (Waley 1937:266, Karlgren 1950:191). Commentaries describe the yupu as a \\"dense and shrubby tree\\". In addition, Ode 132 has baoli : \\"the bushy oaks\\" (Legge 1879:201), \\"a clump of oaks\\" (Waley 1937:75), \\"luxuriant oaks\\" (Karlgren 1950:85). The Erya has baoli , writing bao as \\"an oak\\" instead of \\"bushy; luxuriant\\". =Shujing= The Shujing \\"Classic of History\\" (Zhoushu , Zicai \\"Chinese catalpa lumber\\" section) uses pu once in the compound pozhou (po \\"trim unworked wood\\" and zhuo \\"hack; chop off\\"): \\"as in working with the wood of the rottlera, when the toil of the coarser and finer operations has been completed, they have to apply the paint of red and other colours\\" (Legge 1899:417), \\"It is as when one works on catalpa wood; when he has toiled in trimming and carving it, he should take measures for making it red or green\\" (Karlgren 1950:48). Legge notes that pu means \\"the rough fashioning of the work\\" and zhou means \\"the fine finish given to it\\". Karlgren (1970:313) quotes the Han commentator Ma Rong that po denotes \\"wood that has not yet been worked into a utensil; unworked wood\\", and concludes po means \\"to treat the unworked wood (in the first rough cutting); to trim\\" is a variation of the same stem as pu \\"in a natural state; simple\\". =Daodejing= Six Daodejing chapters use pu , two of them twice, for a total of 8 occurrences. Chapter 19 parallels the near-synonyms su \\"raw silk; white; plain; simple; quiet\\" and pu \\"unworked wood; plain; simple\\", and was the source for Ge Hong's pen-name Baopuzi \\"Master who Embraces Simplicity\\". *Evince the plainness of undyed silk, Embrace the simplicity of the unhewn log; Lessen selfishness, Diminish desires; Abolish learning and you will be without worries. (19, tr. Mair 1990:81) Holmes Welch (1957:35) describes pu \\"the Uncarved Block\\" and su \\"Raw Silk\\" as symbols that Laozi used to expound his basic doctrine of \\"the return to our original nature\\". In modern usage, pu and su mean \\"plain,\\" but originally pu \\"was wood as it came from the tree before man had dressed it\\", while su \\"was silk that man had never dyed or painted.\\" Chapters 28 and 57 mention simple pu in reference to shengren \\"sages\\", Chapter 15 similarly refers to ancient Daoist adepts and describes pu as dun \\"sincere; honest; plain\\". *If eternal integrity suffices, You will return to the simplicity of the unhewn log. ... When the unhewn log is sawn apart, it is made into tools; When the sage is put to use, he becomes the chief of officials. For Great carving does no cutting. (28, tr. Mair 1990:93) *The sage has a saying: \\"I take no action, yet the people transform themselves; I do not interfere in affairs, yet the people enrich themselves; I desire not to desire, yet the people of themselves become simple as unhewn logs.\\" (57, tr. Mair 1990:26) *Those of old who were adept in the Way were ... hesitant, as though crossing a stream in winter; cautious, as though fearful of their neighbors all around; solemn, as though guests in someone else's house; shrinking, as ice when it melts; plain, as an unhewn log; muddled, as turbid waters; expansive, as a broad valley. (15, tr. Mair 1990:76) Among all the Daodejing occurrences of pu, chapter 28 is the only case in which the transmitted and excavated versions are significantly different ‚Äì the transmitted text has an extra grammatical particle zhi \\"a possessive marker; a 3rd person pronoun\\" after yong \\"use; employ\\". Robert G. Henricks (1989:242) explains this small grammatical change between the standard text saying the sage yong zhi \\"uses it\\" and the excavated silk text saying yong \\"is used\\". The transmitted version \\"When the uncarved wood is broken up, it is turned into concrete things. But when the sage uses it, he becomes the leading official.\\" should be read \\"When uncarved wood is cut up, it's turned into vessels. When the Sage is used, he becomes the Head of Officials.\\" D. C. Lau (1989:183) says the traditional passage \\"seems to say that when the uncarved block shatters it becomes vessels. A vessel is a specialist who is only fitted to be an official. Hence the sage when he makes use of these vessels becomes the lord over the officials.\\", but in Mawangdui passage, \\"The meaning is very different. The uncarved block is a symbol for the sage. Just as the uncarved block becomes vessels when it shatters so does the sage become the chief of the officials when he allows himself to be employed, and just as the uncarved block is ruined when it becomes useful, so does a sage become ruined when he becomes useful.\\" The word qi \\"vessel; utensil\\" is translated here as \\"tools\\", \\"concrete things\\", \\"vessels\\", \\"specialists\\", and \\"officials\\". Chapters 32 and 37 both address houwang \\"feudal lords and kings\\" and describe the Dao as wuming \\"nameless\\", while 37 also calls pu \\"nameless\\". *The Way is eternally nameless. Though the unhewn log is small, No one in the world dares subjugate it. If feudal lords and kings could maintain it, The myriad creatures would submit of themselves. (32, tr. Mair 1990:99) *The Way is eternally nameless. If feudal lords and kings preserve it, The myriad creatures will be transformed by themselves. After transformation, if they wish to rise up, I shall restrain them with the nameless unhewn log. By restraining them with the nameless unhewn log, They will not feel disgraced; Not feeling disgraced, They will be still, Whereupon heaven and earth will be made right by themselves. (37, tr. Mair 1990:105) Chapter 37 has a minor textual difference between buyu \\"not desire\\" in the standard version and buru \\"not disgrace\\" in the Mawangdui version (Henricks 1989:260). Lau (1989:xxx) explains pu in the Daodejing primarily means \\"the uncarved block is in a state as yet untouched by the artificial interference of human ingenuity and so is a symbol for the original state of man before desire is produced in him by artificial means\\". The (c. 3rd century CE) Heshang Gong commentary version of this Daoist text interchangeably writes pu as both and . Three chapters (28, 32, 37) use in both text and commentary, and one (15) uses in both. One (19) uses in text and in commentary, and another (57) uses in text and in commentary. *\\"If they change and want to rise, the ego will suppress them by means of the [] simplicity of the nameless.\\"; \\"The ego is the personality. The [] simplicity of the nameless is Tao. If all beings change into their selves, but afterwards revert to desire and exhibit shrewdness and hypocrisy, the princes and the king are obliged to suppress personality by means of Tao and Te.\\" (37, tr. Erkes 1958:70) *\\"Simple like [] unworked wood.\\"; \\"What is simple is material and firm. The form of unworked wood is not yet carved. Within one ought to take care of the spirits, outwards one ought not to be pretentious.\\" (15, tr. Erkes 1958:36) *\\"Look at simplicity and hold fast to [] naturalness.\\"; \\"To look at simplicity corresponds to holding fast to simplicity and keeping to truth as well as to not looking at externals. To hold fast to [] naturalness corresponds to looking at real naturalness in order to show it to the subjects. Thereby one may become a model.\\" (19, tr. Erkes 1958:42) *\\"I am without desires, and the people are [] simple of themselves.\\"; \\"If I am always without desires, if I do away with externals, then the people will follow me and remain [] simple and natural.\\" (57, tr. Erkes 1958:102) Of nine Daodejing chapters without or in the text, three (3, 38, 41) use in commentary, and six (17, 64, 68, 71, 80, 81) use . For examples, *\\"He [the saint] always induces the people not to know and not to desire.\\"; \\"Return to [] simplicity and retain purity.\\" (3, tr. Erkes 1958:18) *\\"Sincere words are not beautiful.\\"; \\"Sincere words are true words. What is not beautiful is [] simple and real.\\" (81, tr. Erkes 1958:134) Welch (1957:84) paraphrases the Daodejing relationship among pu, de \\"inherent character; inner power\\", and wuwei \\"non- action; non-doing\\". Outwardly, one cannot achieve de \\"until you have erased the aggressive patterns etched by society into your nature. You must return to your natural self, to [pu]. You must discard morality and ambition, for if you keep these you will never be capable of compassion, moderation, and humility. When you discard some of your wishes, you will have them all.\\" Inwardly, one performs several cultivations. \\"For, to achieve the outward [pu] you will have to cultivate a [wuwei] of the mind. And when the mind is quiet, [pu] will deepen. It will become a faculty for intuitively sensing the order of the universe‚Äîthe [Dao] that can be named.\\" =Zhuangzi= Pu occurs 20 times in the (ca. 3rd century BCE) Daoist classic Zhuangzi. The standard Zhuangzi text writes pu both with the 16‚Äìstroke character six times in three chapters (9, 13, and 31) and with the 6‚Äìstroke variant character fourteen times in six chapters (7, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 20), which evidences the heterogeneous textual origins. For instance, the word pubi (with bi \\"low; mean; vulgar; unsophisticated\\") is written both \\"crude, mean [heart]\\" (chapter 31, tr. Mair 1994:332) and \\"simple and unsophisticated [people]\\" (10, tr. Mair 1994:87). A frequently occurring Zhuangzi metaphor contrasts returning to pu \\"unhewn log\\" with carving qi \\"vessels\\" (which means \\"specialist; official\\" in Daodejing 28). *In a world of ultimate integrity, men would dwell together with the birds and the beasts. ... Equally without desire, this is called [] \\"the simplicity of the unhewn log\\". With [] the simplicity of the unhewn log, the people would attain their nature. ... Therefore, if [] the simple, unhewn log remained intact, who would carve a sacrificial vessel from it? ... The [] carving of the unhewn log into [] instruments is the fault of the craftsman; the impairment of the Way and integrity with humaneness and righteousness is the error of the sage. (9, tr. Mair 1994:81-82) *Liezi \\"came to believe that he had barely begun to learn. ... He took no sides in affairs and [] whittled himself back to the simplicity of the unhewn log. Clodlike, he stood alone in his physical form. Sealed off against perplexity, in this manner he remained whole to the end.\\" (7, tr. Mair 1994:70) *\\"I have heard it said, 'After all the carving and chiseling, [] Return to the simplicity of the unhewn log'.\\" (20, tr. Mair 1994:190) Another Zhuangzi chapter uses this term fupu \\"return to simplicity\\". *If you were to meet someone who understands great plainness, who subscribes to nonaction and [] returns to the simplicity of the unhewn log, who embodies his nature and embraces his spirit, so as to wander through the common world, you would really be surprised!

In 1910, the design was approved by the Provincial Council of Navarre and it was sanctioned by the Organic Law of Reintegration and Improvement of the Regional Government of Navarre (Ley Org√°nica de Reintegraci√≥n y Amejoramiento del R√©gimen Foral de Navarra, or LORAFNA) of August 10, 1982, which was established in Article 7.2: \\"The flag of Navarre is red-colored, with a shield in the center.\\" The shield is the coat of arms of Navarre, which consists of golden chains arranged against a red background, with an emerald in the center of the pattern linked to the eight chains, with a Royal Crown, a symbol of the ancient Kingdom of Navarre, added on top of the shield. The flag of Navarre began to be used as a symbol for the region from 1910 onwards. The color red was chosen for the flag because this was the color of the field of the coat of arms. Previously, there had been no flag for Navarre per se, but just a royal standard for its monarchs. This was a personal symbol of the king that he included with his coat of arms. The first record of a red background for a flag dates from the 14th century, when the soldiers of King Charles II of Navarre, who intended to occupy Paris, wore distinctive berets of this color, according to Mart√≠n Larrayoz.Patxi Zabaleta.

History The event originated in 1979, when a group of friends hosted a birthday celebration on Easter at an apartment complex on Clay Street. News of the event spread; invitations were distributed and a sound system was installed the following year. During the HIV/AIDS pandemic of the 1980s, party organizers began charging \\"admission\\" in the form of food for local charitable organizations. Over time, the event continued to grow and admission evolved from food to monetary contributions. Bunnies on the Bayou has been held at Wortham Center Fish Plaza in downtown Houston since the 1990s. Since its inception, the fundraiser has raised more than $750,000 for local charities. With the COVID-19 pandemic scrapping the 2020 event, the 42nd was deferred to 2021.

A tropical depression formed on December 21, when a low-level circulation center began to produce deep convection. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm the next day, and was given the name Fern by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). The storm slowly intensified into a Category 1 typhoon on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale, according to JTWC. Fern peaked north of Yap on December 26, with JTWC assessing winds of 150 km/h (90 mph), while the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed peak winds of , just below typhoon strength. The storm soon became sheared and weakened slowly. Fern continued to weaken to a tropical depression on December 30. Both agencies stopped advisories later on the same day. Fern made a direct hit at Yap on Christmas Day. A cargo ship was abandoned after it was damaged by high winds offshore. On the island, Fern caused $3 million (1996 USD) of damage. Roads and bridges were significantly damaged, and other public facilities were destroyed. Crops and private properties also received damage. A state of emergency was declared in Yap State two weeks later, and became a disaster area two months later. Meteorological history In the middle of December, twin monsoon troughs were established in the extreme western Pacific Ocean, which will later spawn storms Greg, and Fern itself in the northern hemisphere. The trough in the southern hemisphere spawned cyclones Ophelia, Phil, and Fergus. Around that time, convection began to increase near the equator, and was associated with a westerly wind burst. A low level circulation center was noted by JTWC on December 19 at 0600 UTC. Two days later, convection consolidated near the circulation center, and JMA began tracking it at 0000 UTC as a tropical depression. JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 1500 UTC, as sea level pressure began to deepen, and signs of upper level divergence were found in the system. The first advisory for Tropical Depression 42W followed three hours later, on December 17 at 1200 UTC. JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm on December 22 at 0000 UTC as it traveled westerly, and was given the name Fern. According to JTWC, the wind speeds meandered at minimal tropical storm strength. JMA proceeded to upgrade the depression into a tropical storm at 1800 UTC, with winds of , and a pressure reading of . On Christmas Eve, Fern slowly traveled toward Yap. The storm passed over Yap the next day, strengthening to at 0000 UTC, according to JTWC. JMA assessed Fern had winds of at the same time. Fern also began its recurvature that day, beginning its turn north. Eighteen hours later on Christmas Day, JTWC upgraded Fern to a typhoon, with winds of . JMA continued to keep it as a severe tropical storm at that time. On December 26 at 1200 UTC, Fern reached its peak at 150 km/h (90 mph) north of Yap after its recurvature, according to JTWC. JMA assessed that Fern reached its peak of , with a pressure reading of twelve hours later. On December 28, Fern began to weaken when it encountered a shear line. On the next day, JTWC downgraded Fern back to tropical storm strength, with winds of . At the same time according to JMA, the storm had weakened to , with a pressure reading of . Both warning centers downgraded Fern into a tropical depression by December 30, as it continued to travel along a shear line. JTWC issued the final warning at 0600 UTC, while JMA stopped tracking the depression at 1200 UTC. JTWC continued to track the low until December 31, where it stalled north of Guam. Impact and aftermath At sea, a cargo ship en route from Guam to Yap was abandoned after it was damaged by high winds. The passengers entered a life raft, and were later found by a Navy search and rescue airplane. They were soon rescued by a Maltese tanker. No one was injured when the accident occurred. Yap was directly hit by Fern on Christmas Day, causing about $3 million (1996 USD) of damage. The Weather Service Office received a peak wind gust of , and a pressure reading of . The island received gusts around for several hours. One person was injured on the island, and no deaths were attributed to the storm. Roads and bridges were severely damaged, accounting for half of the damage. Homes and other private properties were also significantly damaged. Most crops on the island, such as coconuts, bananas, papayas, and breadfruit, were destroyed by the storm. Public facilities, like schools and hospitals, suffered widespread destruction. On January 3, 1997, a state of emergency was declared for Yap by Acting President Jacob Nena, stating that Fern caused \\"an imminent threat to health, safety and welfare of the people of the affected areas.\\" Two months later, on March 20, United States President Bill Clinton declared Yap State a disaster area, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to start the damage assessment of the area. The FEMA funding was only for public facilities, and did not include private properties. The request for individual assistance was not approved by FEMA, as damage to private properties were not much, and assistance from the national government and Yap State were sufficient.

The property was acquired by Allen Urquhart in 1813, and the house was built soon after. The dogtrot house was built in several phases, with the eastern \\"pen\\" being the original section. It was originally built as a one- room log house with a 7-foot (2.1-meter) ceiling. The house was extensively modified around 1835; the ceiling was raised to 9 feet, 2 inches (2.8 m), and many Federal-period details were added, including beaded chair rails and baseboards, an elaborate mantle, and lath and plastered walls. The second floor and western pen may have been added at this time; most of the original details were removed from the western pen in the early 20th century, making it difficult to date its construction. When it was completed, the house's dogtrot form was established, including loft rooms over both pens and the breezeway. An addition was made in the 1860s or 1870s to the rear of the western pen which features a Greek Revival mantle. In circa 1915‚Äì1930, a kitchen was added to the rear of this room, and an enclosed porch was built in the ell along the rear of the house. A front porch was added in the middle of the 20th century. See also: The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. It was included on the Alabama Historical Commission's Places In Peril list for 2013; after years of neglect, the building is nearing collapse.

Born in Hamburg, Germany, where he attended the Wilhelm-Gymnasium, he and his family emigrated to the United States in 1938, fleeing Nazi persecution. He served with the United States Army in World War II, and afterwards received bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees from Harvard University. The author of thirteen books on politics and government, he taught at Amherst College and the University of Pennsylvania. During the Ford administration, he served as United States Ambassador to Cameroon and to Equatorial Guinea, though the latter country declared him persona non grata. He later returned to academia as a professor at the Free University of Berlin. In the early 1990s, he ran for state and then national office as a Republican from Texas, but was not elected. Alt URL Early life Spiro was born in Hamburg, Germany to Jewish parents. His family name is a corruption of Speyer, a town in the Rhineland which once had a significant Jewish community, but he reminisced that in the U.S. it often led people to mistake him for a Greek American. His father worked for a distribution firm. He attended the Wilhelm-Gymnasium. Despite the increasing Nazification of Germany, he states that in liberal Hamburg he experienced no discrimination whatsoever until after Kristallnacht. His family emigrated from Germany just a month later, in December 1938; they passed through New York where their relatives had earlier fled, before settling in San Antonio, Texas. There, Spiro attended Brackenridge High School, and went on to San Antonio Junior College. In a news interview a few years after his arrival, he expressed his disappointment at the relative absence of \\"wild west heroes\\" and American Indians in Texas, contrary to the image of the state that he had formed from the Western fiction popular in his native Germany. Formally an enemy alien, Spiro was not subject to the draft, but after naturalizing in 1944 he volunteered for a military intelligence position. He served with the 11th Armored Division and received the Bronze Star Medal with oak leaf cluster. He spent 1945 and 1946 as an administrative assistant to the United States Department of War, stationed in Vienna. Early academic career After returning to the U.S., Spiro entered Harvard University. He stated that he had originally wanted to attend the University of Texas at Austin, but his mother encouraged him to apply to Harvard instead after hearing that a distant cousin had also been accepted. There, he wrote his senior honors thesis on Marxist critiques of democracy, with William Yandell Elliot as his advisor. He received his master's degree in 1950 and his Ph.D. in 1953, with a doctoral dissertation on accountability in government. He spent the following year in his native Germany as a Fulbright Fellow, and then returned to Harvard in 1954, where he continued as an instructor until 1957. He got engaged to Elizabeth Anna Petersen of Radcliffe College, the daughter of Howard C. Petersen, in February 1958. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in political science in 1959, and lived in Rhodesia and the Central African Republic for the next year. In 1961, Spiro moved from Harvard to Amherst College, where he was Associate Professor of Political Science until 1965. Afterwards he joined the University of Pennsylvania as Professor of Political Science, where he remained until 1970. He then joined the Department of State as a member of the Policy Planning Staff. As ambassador to Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea In July 1975, President Gerald Ford nominated Spiro to succeed C. Robert Moore as United States Ambassador to Cameroon, with concurrent accreditation to Equatorial Guinea. His wife and younger son Alexander accompanied him to Cameroon. while his older son Peter boarded at St. Albans School and visited Cameroon on his summer holidays. Spiro's accreditation to Equatorial Guinea lasted only about half a year, however, as the country declared him persona non grata in March 1976. The United States had closed its embassy in Malabo in 1971 after one American stationed there murdered another, but still maintained diplomatic relations. Spiro and Consul William C. Mithoefer Jr. had nearly finished one of their regular visits to Equatorial Guinea when Equatoguinean Deputy Protocol Director Santiago Nchama presented them with a letter accusing the U.S. government of engaging in subversive activities in the country and complaining about U.S. foreign and domestic policy, including the Vietnam War and U.S. nuclear weapons. A few days later, Equatorial Guinea's foreign ministry sent a telegram to the State Department announcing that the two U.S. diplomats were barred from returning to the country. His posting in Cameroon lasted until May 1977, when he was succeeded by Mabel M. Smythe, the first woman in the post. Electoral politics and later life Spiro taught at Free University of Berlin's John F. Kennedy-Institute for North American Studies from 1980 to 1989. After returning to Texas, he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992 and in 1994, and for the U.S. Senate in the 1993 special election, but failed to be elected. His son Alexander married Vanessa Daryl Green of Potomac, Maryland at the Metropolitan Club of the City of Washington in May 1993; DC Circuit judge Laurence Silberman performed the ceremony. He died in San Antonio in 2010, and was buried at the Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery. He was survived by his sons Peter Spiro and Alexander Spiro, his ex-wife Elizabeth Spiro Clark, and four grandchildren. Works . Reviewed by Henry L. Roberts. * *.

His earlier crime investigation becomes the focus of the reality crime show Views 24x7, and it is at this juncture that priest Varghese Punyaalan (Joy Mathew) and Journalist Haritha Menon (Asha Sarath) enter his life. Both of them want to know about Hyder and his earlier investigations, but their interests are unrelated and have different motivations. In their attempts to attain their goal, each becomes aware of the other, and the resulting conflict builds the rest of the storyline. Cast * Indrajith Sukumaran as S. P.

During filming, there was a shoot day when director Jean Markose was incapacitated due to a high fever, and Indrajith stepped in to temporarily direct a hospital scene featuring Tara Kalyan. Film producer Linu Issac stated \\"Indran (Indrajith) rocked it.\\" Jean Markose is a radio jockey from Dubai and has directed several short films in Dubai. He narrated the script to Indrajith, his wife's cousin, who \\"immediately signed the deal with a handshake\\" as he liked the \\"powerful social message\\" it had. According to director Markose, the film is a \\"social thriller that revolves around ‚ÄòViews 24x7,‚Äô a popular crime and investigative show\\". Indrajith's role is that of a police officer who was tagged as a \\"loser\\" and hence different from other traditional cop roles. Asha Sarath was signed to play a journalist named Haritha, with the actress stating that Haritha was \\"as unscrupulous as Geetha\\", her character in Drishyam.

The initial origins of progressivism come from Western Europe during the 18th century and the Age of Enlightenment when it was believed that social reform and progression in areas such as science, economics, education, technology and medicine were necessary to improve human living conditions. However, during the 19th century British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli advocated an alternative form of progressive politics known as progressive conservatism under his one-nation conservative government.Patrick Dunleavy, Paul Joseph Kelly, Michael Moran. British Political Science: Fifty Years of Political Studies. Oxford, England, UK; Malden, Massachusetts, USA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000. Pp. 107‚Äì108. Witnessing the negative impacts current working conditions had on people during the time, mainly brought about by the Industrial Revolution, Disraeli started to believe that changes to society were needed to improve human and environmental conditions. However, this progression needed to be done through conservative thinking and policies, namely that the government can do good and should get involved, but only when it is necessary and within its own means, being a limited but obligatory government. The idea advocates that a social safety net is required, but only in a minimal form. Christian democracy and Catholic social teaching promotes some form of progressive conservatism, derived from the text of Rerum novarum.Emile F. Sahliyeh. Religious resurgence and politics in the contemporary world. Albany, New York, USA: State University of New York Press, 1990. Pp. 185 Progressive conservatives also believe instant change is not always the best and can sometimes be damaging to society, therefore cautious change is necessary which fits in with the nations social and political traditions. In the United States, Theodore Roosevelt has been the main figure identified with progressive conservatism as a political tradition. Roosevelt stated that he had \\"always believed that wise progressivism and wise conservatism go hand in hand\\". In Britain, one-nation conservatives such as David Cameron who launched the Progressive Conservatism Project in 2009 and Theresa May have described themselves as progressive conservatives. Other European leaders such as Angela Merkel have been aligning themselves with centre-progressive politics with a conservative stance.

It is located in the municipality of Mux√≠a.  Description  The cape is a small peninsula that juts about 1 km into the sea, the narrowest section being an isthmus 150 metres wide between the coasts of Balal and Cu√±o. Its maximum altitude is 93 metres above sea level. The rock it's made of is granite, the erosion of which has caused the formation of deposits of pebbles, known as co√≠dos, and stony bars, forming an islet such as the so- called A √çnsua on the west side of the cape. The western point of the cape, called Os Buxeirados, has a series of rocks that go into the sea around 300 to 400 metres, known as A Laxe de Buxeirados or Bajos de Buxeirados. These rocks have proved dangerous for navigation, causing some serious shipwrecks. Due to its rugged landscape, the vegetation of the cape is basically just thorny reed or gorse like Ulex eruopaeus. In the northern part of the cape, there is a lighthouse and complementary buildings established 15 December 1898.  Name  The name comes from the nearby parish of Touri√±√°n, in which the cape is located, and that must go back to the Latin name, which is supposed to be \\"Taurinius\\" or \\"Taurinianus\\" through the genitive \\"Tauriniani\\".

It is the second song that is part of their second studio album Lluvia de gallinas; released in 1984 by 20th Century Records.  Interpretation of the lyrics  The lyrics of the song tell a fictional story about seeing death in a car accident and being told in first person. The text itself is a fallacy; because its author explained that the text is fictional, although he dedicated it to a cousin, who died in a traffic accident. Thus, the text is written from the place of the victim and the feelings they may have felt to experience death.Lluvia de gallinas (1984) It has become a classic of Argentine rock and was ranked #95 of the top 100 songs of Argentine rock.Biograf√≠a y discos de Sueter: Lluvia de gallinas It has also been performed by artists as diverse as Fabiana Cantilo, Hilda Lizarazu, and Olivia Viggiano, among others.

He served from 1962 to 1976 as public safety commissioner of the city, which was an elected position. Solid achievements were attributed to him. He was investigated more than once for misuse of city funds. D'Artois was arrested on August 6, 1976, for allegedly being implicated in the shooting death in July 1976 of Jim Leslie, an advertising executive in Shreveport who had managed his 1974 campaign. He was released for lack of evidence. A trial on charges of theft of city funds and intimidation of witnesses was postponed several times because of D'Artois's poor health. Arrested again in April 1977 for Leslie's murder, D'Artois died the next month during heart surgery at the age of fifty-one, and never went to trial. Histories published in the 21st century say that D'Artois was involved with crime families in the city and had contracted for the murders of both Leslie and his killer, to prevent their testimony before a grand jury. Background D'Artois was one of two sons of William Francis D'Artois, Sr., and the former Mary Holmes. He graduated from C. E. Byrd High School, the original public high school for white students in Shreveport. During World War II, he served for three years in the United States Marine Corps in the Pacific Theater of Operations, with action beginning in November 1943 in the Battle of Bougainville. He attained the rank of sergeant. After the war, D'Artois studied Business Administration at Centenary College in Shreveport and Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. He married the former Billie Claire Best, and the couple had a son, George, Jr., known as Wendell (born c. 1955), and two daughters, Mary Cecile and Elaine Claire. During D'Artois's tenure, Shreveport had a commission form of government. Commissioners were elected at-large and exercised both legislative and executive duties, both on the city council and as a department head. There were relatively few commissioner seats on the council. This kept power in the hands of those who could gain a majority of voters. African Americans were still mostly disenfranchised and were not yet being elected to local office. Soon the civil rights movement raised legal challenges to the city commission governments, charging that they prevented minorities from being able to elect candidates of their choice. Political career For a time, D'Artois served as director of the Shreveport junior athletics program. In 1952, he became a deputy for the Caddo Parish Sheriff's Department under J. Howell Flournoy. He joined the Democratic Party, which still dominated politics in the state and South during the decades when most African Americans were disenfranchised under the 1898 constitution. It had raised barriers to voter registration, as did the common Jim Crow discriminatory practices in most jurisdictions. After nine years as deputy sheriff, D'Artois resigned to run in 1962 for public safety commissioner in Shreveport. The city commission was a five-member body that exercised combined executive and legislative functions. All position were elected at-large and each had a specific departmental responsibility. This structure preserved power in the hands of the majority of voters. The public service commissioner was sometimes seen as a step toward higher office: Governor Jimmie Davis had served in that position in Shreveport from 1938 to 1942. The other commissioners led such departments as public works, utilities, and finance. The mayor, also elected at-large, was technically the \\"commissioner of administration.\\" D'Artois was first elected commissioner in 1962, when he upset the two-term incumbent J. Earl Downs. (His brother, C. H. \\"Sammy\\" Downs, an attorney in Alexandria, was a close associate of governors Earl Kemp Long and John McKeithen.) D'Artois was re-elected in 1966, 1970, and 1974. As the public safety commissioner, D'Artois headed the Shreveport Fire Department in addition to law enforcement. =Racial matters= In the early 1960s, D'Artois was accused of using intimidation to suppress civil rights activities by African Americans in Shreveport. Efforts were building to end segregation and support voter registration. Many consider 1963 to be the height of racial tensions in the city. In September 1963, D'Artois denied a permit to a group wanting to march a short distance to the Little Union Baptist Church, where a service was to be held by Reverend Harry Blake, a civil rights advocate and pastor. They were meeting to honor the families of and the four black girls who had been killed that month in the notorious church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama. (Blake later was called to the Mt. Canaan Baptist Church in Shreveport and has served as general secretary of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., which freedmen and free blacks formed as an independent black association in the nineteenth century after emancipation.) D'Artois ordered his riot squad against what observers said was a peaceful demonstration. He rode on horseback into the church sanctuary, interrupting a service and violating sacred space. He dragged Reverend Blake away from the congregation and beat him severely.Keristen Holmes, \\"Local Civil Rights Leaders Look Back 50 Years\\", KTBS-TV, 18 September 2013; accessed 21 March 2019 Rev. Blake was hospitalized for weeks. As D'Artois continued to seek office in a changing political climate, when African Americans could vote freely, he maintained his popularity with whites and cultivated it with blacks. Early in his tenure, the segregationist White Citizens Council was active in Caddo Parish. He continued to appeal to conservative whites. In the general election for state offices held on February 6, 1968, Republican State Representative Taylor W. O'Hearn of Shreveport was seeking a second term. Many more African Americans were voting since passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and they widely supported Democratic candidates. O'Hearn notified D'Artois and Caddo Parish Sheriff James M. Goslin that election laws had been violated at three predominately African-American voting precincts in Shreveport. O'Hearn told them that Democrats passed out campaign literature at the door of one polling place, and were fewer than the required 200 feet minimum from the entrance of the two other precincts. O'Hearn said that D'Artois and Goslin both told him that the matter was out of their jurisdiction.Shreveport Journal, February 7, 1968, p. 1 In 1971, D'Artois commandeered a drug bust at Columbia Park in the South Highlands neighborhood of Shreveport. The police blocked exits and arrested youths using marijuana. A class action suit by civil rights activists prevented such police sweeps of city parks thereafter. At a 1975 meeting of a Rotary International club at the old Captain Shreve Hotel in downtown Shreveport, D'Artois told the mostly white businessmen that he had set up a special police unit to monitor crime- plagued nightclubs in the black community. He reported that the unit had seized concealed handguns and made arrests, which he expected to calm fears about crime in Shreveport. At the same time, D'Artois allowed black bars and establishments with gambling to remain open past legal closing time, purged out-of-town gamblers from Shreveport, and protected black business owners from the criminal element. In both cases, he was cementing his diverse political support. =Investigations of D'Artois= D'Artois's administration was repeatedly investigated on allegations of mismanagement and corruption. He was investigated by journalist Bill Keith of the Shreveport Times, who was later elected as a Louisiana State Senator. Several hundred thousand dollars went missing from a 1968 bond issue, which was earmarked to D'Artois's department and intended to finance the synchronized traffic system. None of the Shreveport City Council members could ever account for these funds. Mayor Calhoun Allen speculated that the funds went to other \\"needed projects\\". =Reelection campaigns= In the 1970 election, D'Artois received 59.8 percent of the vote in a contest with the Republican nominee William Kimball, who carried the Southern Hills section of south Shreveport. This was a lower percentage than in previous elections.Louisiana Secretary of State, Caddo Parish election returns, November 3, 1970 Concerned about growing Republican strength in the state, in 1974 D'Artois hired James S. \\"Jim\\" Leslie (1937‚Äì1976), a former Shreveport Times journalist who had become an advertising executive, to manage communications for his campaign for a fourth term as commissioner. After D'Artois won, he gave Leslie a check for his services that was drawn on city funds. Leslie returned the check and asked that it be reissued on D'Artois's campaign account. According to Leslie, D'Artois gave him another check from city funds. Leslie did not cash either of them. During the mid-1970s, the Shreveport Times published a series on its investigation of D'Artois. It identified what totaled as a $30,00O felony theft of city funds, allegedly by D'Artois. One of newspaper's lines of investigation led to Leslie, who told its reporter about the two uncancelled city checks from D'Artois. On July 9, 1976, Leslie was in Baton Rouge; he had created an ad campaign in support of passage of a right-to-work bill, which was strongly opposed by labor unions. After its narrow passage that night in the Senate, he had celebrated with supporters and colleagues. The victory has often been attributed to the lobbying from the newly organized Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, founded by Edward J. Steimel. Afterward Leslie returned to his hotel, the Prince Murat Inn, before returning home to Shreveport the next day. Leslie parked in one of the few available spaces, which was near the edge of the parking lot. He was shot and killed instantly by shotgun pellets, by an unknown assailant from behind a fence at the edge of the lot. Because of the lack of evidence at the scene, Baton Rouge police describe the homicide as a \\"professional hit.\\" AP, Monroe News-Star, 19 April 1977; accessed 17 March 2019 Rusty Griffith, who had ties to D'Artois, was suspected of being the hit man in Leslie's shotgun murder. It was thought that Leslie was being kept from testifying about information about D'Artois's administration learned while working on his campaign, or for the alleged attempt to pay him for campaign expense from city funds. Not long after Leslie's death, Griffith was shot and killed in 1976 in Concordia Parish. On August 6, 1976, D'Artois was charged for his alleged involvement with the shotgun slaying of advertising executive Jim Leslie, on an arrest warrant by East Baton Rouge Parish, signed by 19th Judicial District Judge Douglas Gonzales. He was released for lack of evidence but was forced to resign from office. Judge John F. Fant, son of the late Mayor Clyde Fant of Shreveport, ordered D'Artois to appear in court on October 13, 1976, to face charges on the $300,000 theft of city funds and the intimidation of witnesses before the grand jury. D'Artois's attorney informed the judge that the former commissioner was too ill to appear.\\"D'Artois ordered by Fant to appear in court Oct. 13\\", Minden Press-Herald, October 4, 1976, p. 6 =Prosecution= D'Artois was arrested again in the Leslie case on April 19, 1977, on a warrant signed by Judge Gonzales. He barricaded himself from police in the attic of his house, and said he would never agree to go to the Caddo Parish jail. At the time, he demanded the use of a typewriter and wrote a statement, which was held by police. D'Artois died on June 11, 1977, before any trial, during heart surgery in San Antonio, Texas. His death meant that the charges against him were never tried or resolved. In 1976 and 1977, D'Artois's attorney had gotten his trial postponed several times. But in April 1977, Judge William J. Fleniken of the Louisiana 1st Judicial District Court ruled that D'Artois had to stand trial for the felony theft of $300,000 in municipal funds, which had been recorded as paid to police informers. D'Artois's attorney again questioned how his client could be tried, because of his health. Judge Fleniken said prosecutors had to provide doctors and medical equipment at the courthouse during the trial. D'Artois's attorney appealed and the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that judges had to consider the defendant's overall health in deciding whether a person is too ill for trial. D'Artois died on June 11, 1977, during surgery in San Antonio, Texas, for his heart. After the former commissioner's death, Elliott Stonecipher, a Shreveport consultant and political analyst described D'Artois as \\"the most powerful ever public official [in Shreveport] ... who dragged the citizenry through the deep ditch of a corruption scandal which forever stained our city.\\" On July 3, 1977, Dr. William E. Hull (1930‚Äì2013), the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Shreveport from 1975 to 1987, delivered the sermon \\"Shreveport at the Crossroads\\", a condemnation of the scandal engulfing D'Artois, who had died the previous month. Hull discussed the long-range prospects for the recovery of quality of life in the city. Stonecipher said that friends told him later that there was > \\"a remarkable silence in the huge sanctuary as the sermon was preached. Many > of those to whom Dr. Hull would impersonally refer were, in fact, sitting > and listening, saving their reactions for other days and times. We might > well imagine how sons and daughters of Shreveport's multi-generational > leadership elite felt as they heard such remarks ...\\" A special election was held on October 2, 1977, to choose a successor public service commissioner for the year remaining in D'Artois's term. D'Artois was interred at Forest Park Cemetery East in Shreveport. Jim Leslie had been interred there the year before. Aftermath Some analysts said that the corruption under D'Artois and in other departments occurred because of the commission form of government. Given executive and legislative authority, the commissioners were not adequately checked by their colleagues on the city council. In this form of government, each of the commissioners \\"sort of had their own little fiefdoms\\", explained Lynn Stewart, a former reporter for The Shreveport Times. By 1978, the city replaced the commission form of government with the current mayor‚Äìcouncil format. Council members are elected from single-member districts, enabling broader representation of residents on the council and the expression of minority viewpoints.

Location The church building is located at 287 on Sydney Road, one of the main roads in the Northern suburb of Brunswick in Melbourne.Parish website: Contact US St Ambrose's Church, Heritage Victoria History In the second half of the 19th century, the land where the church building now stands belonged to Mr. Michael Dawson of Brunswick.Parish website: History However, in 1860, it was also used as a camp for nomadic Aboriginals.Laura Donati, Almost Pretty: A History of Sydney Road, Laura Donati: West Brunswick, Victoria, 2005, p. 16 In the late 1860s, Dawson donated the land to the Catholic Church for a new church to be built in the neighbourhood. Prior to this, Catholics who lived in Brunswick had to go to Coburg, North of Brunswick, or to the Melbourne City Centre, South of Brunswick. The church was named in honour of Saint Ambrose (340‚Äì397), who served as the Archbishop of Milan in Italy in the fourth century AD, after an Italian family from Milan who lived in Brunswick suggested it. The first foundation stone was laid in 1869, with 800 Catholics in attendance.Museum Victoria: Municipality of Brunswick, Victoria After spending ¬£6,000, the building was completed in 1873. In 1890, it became a parish church, cut off from the Coburg parish. Nine years later, in 1899, the church building was extended, with additional transepts, a sanctuary, two chapels, a porch and a baptistry. On 19 February 1899 a memorial stone was also added near the Northern transept. During the First World War, it was a meeting place for the anti-conscription movement. The church building was restored in 2000. Heritage significance The church building was designed in the Gothic Revival architectural style, with a cruciform plan. The wall are made of bluestone, and the roof is made of timber. There is also an organ dating back to the nineteenth century, and stained glass windows. It has been listed by Heritage Victoria with a \\"Heritage Overlay,\\" which aims to protect places of local significance to Victoria.

Early life Mahitab Kadƒ±n was born in 1830 in Mahachkala, Dagestan, Russia. Born as Nuriye, she was a member of a Chechen noble family. Her father was Hi≈üam Bey and her mother was Malika Hanƒ±m. She had two brothers and two sisters. Hƒ±≈üam Bey's elder sister, ≈ûevkinihak Hanƒ±m, had been in service in the imperial harem. For this reason, Nuriye and her siblings were sent to live with her at Istanbul. She and her sisters were then taken into the imperial harem, where her name according to the custom of the Ottoman court was changed to Mahitab. While her brothers were brought up out of the palace by a certain Ali'ebru Hanƒ±m. Marriage Mahitab married Abdulmejid in 1845. She was given the title of \\"Second Fortunate\\". Three years later, on 15 April 1848, she gave birth to her first child, a daughter, Sabiha Sultan in the Old √áƒ±raƒüan Palace. The princess died a year later on 27 April 1849. In 1850, she was elevated to the title of \\"Senior Fortunate\\". Two years later on 31 March 1852, she gave birth to her second child, a son, ≈ûehzade Nureddin in the Old √áƒ±raƒüan Palace. In early 1853, she was elevated to the title of \\"Fifth Consort\\". On 24 February 1855, she gave birth to twin girls, Zekiye Sultan and Fehime Sultan. Both of them died in 1856. Widowhood and death After Abdulmejid's death on 25 June 1861, Mahitab settled in the Feriye Palace with her eleven years old son, ≈ûehzade Nureddin. Mahitab always supported Shamil, 3rd Imam of Dagestan, and in 1870, he and his family visited her. Her son, Nureddin died in 1884 at the age of thirty two.

He has been described as \\"one of the Church's great missionaries\\" of the 1830s.Lavina Fielding Anderson, \\"Kirtland's Resolute Saints\\", Ensign, January 1979. Carter was born in Benson, Vermont, where his family had moved from Killingworth, Connecticut in the late 1700s. In 1831, while living in Broome County, New York, he was introduced to the Book of Mormon and the new church founded by Joseph Smith the year before. On February 20, 1831, Carter was baptized into the Church of Christ by Hyrum Smith. In June, Carter was made a priest and in September, he was made an elder. Shortly thereafter, he was appointed by Smith to be a missionary in the eastern United States. On this mission, he healed and baptized John Tanner, one of the primary financial benefactors of the early church,Leonard J. Arrington, \\"The John Tanner Family\\", Ensign, March 1979. and Zera Pulsipher, who became a leader in the church. Between 1831 and 1834, Carter served missions in the eastern states, Michigan Territory, and Upper Canada. Carter introduced Mormonism to his brother John, who also became a leader in the church. In May 1833, Carter became a high priest and became a member of the building committee of the Kirtland Temple. On February 17, 1834, Carter and his brother John became two of the inaugural members of the first presiding high council of the church in Kirtland, Ohio. Carter became the president of this body on September 9, 1837, and continued as a member of it when church headquarters were moved to Far West, Missouri, and then to Nauvoo, Illinois. In Missouri in 1838, Carter was one of the leaders of the Danites with Sampson Avard and George W. Robinson. Carter is mentioned in a number of the revelations of Smith which make up the Doctrine and Covenants; one section is addressed directly to Carter.Doctrine and Covenants section 79 (LDS Church ed.); section 78 (CC ed.). Upon the death of Joseph Smith, Carter supported the succession claims of James Strang. Carter joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite) in 1846, but was excommunicated within months of joining. After his excommunication, Carter joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church) in Chicago. He moved to DeKalb County, Illinois, where he died before he could rejoin the majority of LDS Church members in Utah Territory.

A toric ideal is an ideal generated by differences of monomials (provided the ideal is a prime ideal). An affine or projective algebraic variety defined by a toric ideal or a homogeneous toric ideal is an affine or projective toric variety, possibly non-normal. Definitions and Properties Let \\\\mathbb{K} be a field and R = \\\\mathbb{K}[x] be the polynomial ring over \\\\mathbb{K} with n variables x = x_1, x_2, \\\\dotsc, x_n. A monomial in R is a product x^{\\\\alpha} = x_1^{\\\\alpha_1} x_2^{\\\\alpha_2} \\\\cdots x_n^{\\\\alpha_n} for an n-tuple \\\\alpha = (\\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, \\\\dotsc, \\\\alpha_n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^n of nonnegative integers. The following three conditions are equivalent for an ideal I \\\\in R: # I is generated by monomials, # If f = \\\\Sigma_{\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^n} c_{\\\\alpha} x^{\\\\alpha} \\\\in I , then x^{\\\\alpha} \\\\in I , provided that c_{\\\\alpha} is nonzero. # I is torus fixed, i.e, given (c_1, c_2, \\\\dotsc, c_n) \\\\in (\\\\mathbb{K}^*)^{n} , then I is fixed under the action f(x_i) = c_ix_i for all i. We say that I \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{K}[x] is a monomial ideal if it satisfies any of these equivalent conditions. Given a monomial ideal I = (m_1, m_2, \\\\dotsc, m_k) , f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \\\\dotsc, x_n] is in I if and only if every monomial ideal term f_i of f is a multiple of one the m_j. Proof: Suppose I = (m_1, m_2, \\\\dotsc, m_k) and that f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \\\\dotsc, x_n] is in I. Then f = f_1m_1 + f_2m_2 + \\\\dotsm + f_km_k, for some f_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \\\\dotsc, x_n]. For all 1 \\\\leqslant i \\\\leqslant k, we can express each f_i as the sum of monomials, so that f can be written as a sum of multiples of the m_i. Hence, f will be a sum of multiples of monomial terms for at least one of the m_i. Conversely, let I = (m_1, m_2, \\\\dotsc, m_k) and let each monomial term in f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K} [x_1, x_2, . . . , x_n] be a multiple of one of the m_i in I. Then each monomial term in I can be factored from each monomial in f. Hence f is of the form f = c_1m_1 + c_2m_2 + \\\\dotsm + c_km_k for some c_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \\\\dotsc, x_n], as a result f \\\\in I. The following illustrates an example of monomial and polynomial ideals. Let I = (xyz, y^2) then the polynomial x^2yz + 3xy^2 is in since each term is a multiple of an element in i.e., they can be rewritten as x^2yz = x(xyz) and 3xy^2 = 3x(y^2), both in However, if J = (xz^2, y^2) , then this polynomial x^2yz + 3xy^2 is not in since its terms are not multiples of elements in  Monomial Ideals and Young Diagrams  A monomial ideal can be interpreted as a Young diagram. Suppose I \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}[x, y], then I can be interpreted in terms of the minimal monomials generators as I = (x^{a_1}y^{b_1}, x^{a_2}y^{b_2},\\\\dotsc, x^{a_k}y^{b_k}), where a_1 > a_2 > \\\\dotsm > a_k \\\\geq 0 and b_r > \\\\dotsm > b_2 > b_1 \\\\geq 0. The minimal monomial generators of I can be seen as the inner corners of the Young diagram. The minimal generators would determine where we would draw the staircase diagram. The monomials not in I lie inside the staircase, and these monomials form a vector space basis for the quotient ring \\\\mathbb{R}[x, y]/I. Consider the following example. Let I = (x^3, x^2y, y^3) \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}[x, y] be a monomial ideal. Then the set of grid points S = {\\\\\\\\{(3, 0), (2, 1),(0, 3)}\\\\\\\\} \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{N}^2 corresponds to the minimal monomial generators x^3y^0, x^2y^1, x^0y^3 in I. Then as the figure shows, the pink Young diagram consists of the monomials that are not in I. The points in the inner corners of the Young diagram, allow us to identify the minimal monomials x^0y^3, x^2y^1, x^3y^0 in I as seen in the green boxes. Hence, I = (y^3, x^2y, x^3). A Young diagram and its connection with its monomial ideal. In general, to any set of grid points, we can associate a Young diagram, so that the monomial ideal is constructed by determining the inner corners that make up the staircase diagram; likewise, given a monomial ideal, we can make up the Young diagram by looking at the (a_i, b_j) and representing them as the inner corners of the Young diagram. The coordinates of the inner corners would represent the powers of the minimal monomials in I . Thus, monomial ideals can be described by Young diagrams of partitions. Moreover, the (\\\\mathbb{C}^*)^2 -action on the set of I \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{C}[x, y] such that \\\\dim_{\\\\mathbb{C}} \\\\mathbb{C}[x, y]/I = n as a vector space over \\\\mathbb{C} has fixed points corresponding to monomial ideals only, which correspond to partitions of size n, which are identified by Young diagrams with n boxes. Monomial Ordering and Gr√∂bner Basis A monomial ordering is a well ordering \\\\geq on the set of monomials such that if a, m_1, m_2 are monomials, then am_1 \\\\geq am_2. By the monomial order, we can state the following definitions for a polynomial in \\\\mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \\\\dotsc, x_n] . Definition # Consider an ideal I \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \\\\dotsc, x_n] , and a fixed monomial ordering. The leading term of a nonzero polynomial f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \\\\dotsc, x_n] , denoted by LT(f) is the monomial term of maximal order in f and the leading term of f = 0 is 0 . # The ideal of leading terms, denoted by LT(I) , is the ideal generated by the leading terms of every element in the ideal, that is, LT(I) = (LT(f) \\\\mid f\\\\in I) . # A Gr√∂bner basis for an ideal I \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \\\\dotsc, x_n] is a finite set of generators {\\\\\\\\{g_1, g_2, \\\\dotsc, g_s}\\\\\\\\} for I whose leading terms generate the ideal of all the leading terms in I , i.e., I = (g_1, g_2, \\\\dotsc, g_s) and LT(I) = (LT(g_1), LT(g_2), \\\\dotsc, LT(g_s)) . Note that LT(I) in general depends of the ordering used; for example, if we choose the lexicographical order on \\\\mathbb{R}[x, y] subject to x > y, then LT(2x^3y + 9xy^5 + 19) = 2x^3y, but if we take y > x then LT(2x^3y + 9xy^5 + 19) = 9xy^5. In addition, monomials are present on Gr√∂bner basis and to define the division algorithm for polynomials with several variables. Notice that for a monomial ideal I = (g_1, g_2, \\\\dotsc, g_s) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}[x_1, x_2, \\\\dotsc, x_n], the finite set of generators {\\\\\\\\{g_1, g_2, \\\\dotsc, g_s}\\\\\\\\} is a Gr√∂bner basis for I. To see this, note that any polynomial f \\\\in I can be expressed as f = a_1g_1 + a_2g_2 + \\\\dotsm + a_sg_s for a_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}[x_1, x_2, \\\\dotsc, x_n]. Then the leading term of f is a multiple for some g_i. As a result, LT(I) is generated by the g_i likewise.

Dhenupureeswarar is the local name for the Hindu deity Shiva. Religious significance Dhenupureeswarar got his name because he gave moksha to a cow (). Sage Kapila is said to have been reborn as a cow for his sin of having improperly worshiped a Shiva lingam using his left hand. The cow continued to worship Shiva by pouring milk on a Shiva lingam buried in the ground. The cowherd initially punished the cow for wasting the milk, but when the villagers unearthed the Shiva lingam, Shiva appeared and granted moksha (liberation) to Kapila and forgave the cowherd who had mistreated him. Legend has it that the king had a dream of this occurrence at this site and had the temple built to commemorate it. Dhenupureeswarar's consort here is Dhenukambal. The main building of the temple, which contains the statue of Dhenupureeswara in linga form, faces east and his consort faces south in a separate sanctum. The Shiva lingam is Swayambhu Lingam or Self Manifested Lingam. It is an interesting story of how the temple was discovered from its ruins. One of the Bhakts approached Maha Periyava Sri Chandra Sekarendra Saraswathi Swamigal and sought His blessings for his new built home at Selaiyur. Maha Periyava blessed him, and told him that there is an old Siva temple lying in ruins at a nearby village called Madambakkam. In those days, even Selaiyur was a distant suburb, and no one had heard of Madambakkam, even in Selaiyur. The Bhakt gathered some more men, and went in search of the temple. They cleared the bushes near the agricultural fields, and found an astounding temple in Chola architecture. They renovated it, performed Kumbabhishekam, and commenced daily pujas. The temple is now attracting thousands of people from nearby locations. Vimana Construction The temple was built during the reign of the Chola king, Parantaka Chola II, father of Raja Raja Chola I, who constructed the famous Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur. The main sanctum (), like some other Chola temples in and around Chennai, is apsidal in shape (Sanskrit: gajaprishta vimana) (also described as shaped like the back of a sleeping elephant), unlike most Hindu shrines, which are square or rectangular. The temple is thought to have been consolidated with stones during the reign of Kulothunga Chola I. Well-preserved Chola sculptures and carved pillar bases are present in and around both sanctums. A number of fine inscriptions and sculptures dating to the Vijayanagara Empire are also preserved. Nandi statue Restoration The temple is one of a number of sites that have been conserved and restored under the auspices of the Archaeological Survey of India. Improvements included removing the damaged thick weathering course (roof surface) of the front mandapa and Amman Shrine and relaying with fresh weathering course. The ASI states that the temple has been declared a monument of national importance under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (amendment and validation) 2010 Act. The temple is a National Monuments Authority notified site upon which construction is banned. Verses mentioning the temple from Arunagirinathar's Thirupugazh inscribed on the temple wall Cultural significance The 15th century Tamil poet Arunagirinathar's work contains a line mentioning the temple. A number of religious festivals are celebrated at the temple, including Pradosha, Panguni Uttiram and during Navarathri, devotees visit to offer special pujas.

As of 2011, this type of battery was generally not available for the consumer, although their development at that time was considered to be approaching practical use. ORBs are potentially more environmentally friendly than conventional metal-based batteries, because they use organic radical polymers (flexible plastics) to provide electrical power instead of metals. ORBs are considered to be a high-power alternative to the Li-ion battery. Functional prototypes of the battery have been researched and developed by different research groups and corporations including the Japanese corporation NEC. The organic radical polymers used in ORBs are examples of stable radicals, which are stabilized by steric and/or resonance effects. For example, the nitroxide radical in (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO), the most common subunit used in ORBs, is a stable oxygen-centered molecular radical. Here, the radical is stabilized by delocalization of electrons from the nitrogen onto the oxygen. TEMPO radicals can be attached to polymer backbones to form poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl- piperidenyloxyl-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA). PTMA- based ORBs have a charge-density slightly higher than that of conventional Li- ion batteries, which should theoretically make it possible for an ORB to provide more charge than a Li-ion battery of similar size and weight. As of 2007, ORB research was being directed mostly towards Hybrid ORB/Li-ion batteries because organic radical polymers with appropriate electrical properties for the anode are difficult to synthesize. Applications As of 2015, ORBs were still under development and not in commercial use. Theoretically, ORBs could replace Li-ion batteries as more environmentally friendly batteries of similar or higher charge capacity and similar or shorter charge time. This would make ORBs well-suited for handheld electronic devices. Organic radical batteries were first researched and developed by NEC in 2005 with the intent of being widely used to power tiny gadgets in the near future. They began with a size of 0.3 mm and an extremely quick charge time. Since the beginning of development, smart cards and RFID tags were the main targets for ORB usage. NEC has also worked on a larger 0.7 mm battery which is thicker, but also has a high charge capacity of 5 mAh. Given the fast redox chemistry of nitroxide radicals, ORBs have been shown useful in keeping a computer running momentarily following a power outage. Although the amount of additional time provided is short, it is adequate to allow a computer to backup any crucial data before completely shutting down. Function Radical polymer batteries rely on a redox reaction of an organic radical to generate an electrochemical potential. The most studied example of such an organic radical redox reaction is that of nitroxide radicals, such as the one found on a molecule called (2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl, also known as TEMPO. A nitroxide radical can be oxidized to an oxammonium cation or reduced to a hydroxylamine anion. Redox chemistry of the TEMPO-group, which contains a nitroxide. TEMPO-unit and the negative terminal is the same as found in a Li- ion battery. The positive electrode uses the nitroxide - oxammonium cation redox pair to create an electrochemical potential, i.e. when the battery discharges the nitroxide radical is oxidized to the oxammonium cation and when the battery charges the oxammonium cation is reduced back to the nitroxide. The redox potentials for nitroxide show some variation and for the TEMPO nitroxide for this redox pair has an oxidation potential of +0.87 V. The positive electrode often takes the shape of a gel made of organic radical solids and graphite, permeated with electrolytes. Graphite is mixed with the polymer to increase the conductivity.Nishide, H.; Suga, T. The Electrochemical Society Interface 2005, No. Winter, 32‚Äì36 The negative electrode uses the nitroxide - hydroxylamine anion redox pair to create an electrochemical potential, i.e. when the battery discharges the nitroxide radical is reduced to the hydroxylamine anion and when the battery charges the hydroxylamine anion is oxidized back to the nitroxide. This half-reaction has an oxidation potential of -0.11 V. Since this half-reaction is not readily reversible as the half-reaction at the positive electrode, several research groups have steered away from using pure organic radical batteries and instead use metal/ORB hybrid batteries usually consist of a radical polymer cathode and the same anode found in rechargeable Li-ion batteries.Nishide, H.; Iwasa, S.; Pu, Y.-J.; Suga, T.; Nakahara, K.; Satoh, M. Electrochimica Acta 2004, 50 (2‚Äì3), 827‚Äì831. doi: 10.1016/j.electacta.2004.02.052 Much like a traditional battery such as a Li-ion battery, an organic radical battery consists of a cathode and an anode that are separated by a porous film and submerged in an electrolyte. In a pure organic radical battery, both terminals are made of organic radical polymers (a p-type and an n-type polymer), while a metal/ORB hybrid battery usually has a radical polymer cathode and a Li-ion/graphite anode.  Synthesis of radical polymers Several synthetic approaches have been utilized in the synthesis of polyradical species for use in organic radical batteries. The following methods have been used to successfully synthesize poly(2,2,6,6- tetramethylpiperidinyloxy-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA) and other nitroxide polymers. =Free-radical polymerization = Initial attempts to synthesize PTMA involved synthesizing the polymer without radical functionality via free radical polymerization. Once the polymer is synthesized, the nitroxide function can be introduced by oxidation.Bugnon, L.; Morton, C. J. H.; Novak, P.; Vetter, J.; Nesvadba, P. Chem. Mater. 2007, 19 (11), 2910‚Äì2914. doi: 10.1021/cm063052h Several groups have described successful synthesis of PTMA (4) using free radical polymerization of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine methacrylate (2) with 2,2‚Äô-azobisiobutryonitrile (AIBN) as a radical initiator. The monomer was prepared via 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinol (1) and methacryloyl chloride. The precursor neutral polymer (3) was oxidized to the stable radical polymer (4) by 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA).Kurosaki, T.; Lee, K. W.; Okawara, M. J. Polym. Sci. A-1 Polym. Chem. 1972, 10 (11), 3295‚Äì3310. doi: 10.1002/pol.1972.170101116Nakahara, K.; Iwasa, S.; Satoh, M.; Morioka, Y.; Iriyama, J.; Suguro, M.; Hasegawa, E. Chemical Physics Letters 2002, 359 (5‚Äì6), 351‚Äì354. doi: 10.1016/S0009-2614(02)00705-4 Similar synthetic approaches have been proposed using 4-methacryloyloxy-N- hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine as a monomer rather than 2,2,6,6- tetramethylpiperidine methacrylate.Kurosaki, T.; Takahashi, O.; Okawara, M. J. Polym. Sci. Polym. Chem. Ed. 1974, 12 (7), 1407‚Äì1420. doi: 10.1002/pol.1974.170120705 Free-radical polymerization of 4-methacryloyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine to form PTMA Free-radical polymerization as a synthetic approach has several drawbacks. The most relevant limitation is the fact that precursor polymer oxidation never proceeds to 100%. As a result, the synthesized PTMA has between 65% and 81% of the theoretically possible amount of nitroxide groups. The decreased number of nitroxide groups negatively impacts the charge capacity of the polymer and limits its efficacy in organic radical batteries. Not only are there fewer nitroxide groups present, but also side reactions between non-oxidized groups and oxammonium cations diminishes the redox reversibility of the compound. The difficulties of free-radical polymerization of PTMA could be avoided if the oxidation step were not necessary. However, because nitroxide radicals would react with any carbon radicals formed during polymerization, use of a monomer with a nitroxide radical isn‚Äôt practical. =RAFT-mediated polymerization = One of the more recent techniques identified to synthesis PTMA is a type of free radical polymerization known as reversibly addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) mediated polymerization.Rostro, L.; Baradwaj, A. G.; Boudouris, B. W. ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2013, 5 (20), 9896‚Äì9901. doi: 10.1021/am403223s RAFT mediated polymerization of TEMPO RAFT-mediated polymerization of PTMA utilizes the same starting monomer as free-radical polymerization. Using the RAFT-mediated approach to polymerize 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl methacrylate (TMPM), the starting monomer, generates poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidnyl methacrylate) or PTMPM-RAFT. Direct oxidation of PTMPM-RAFT to PTMA is not practical, as direct oxidation causes side reactions involving the thiocaronylthiol end group of PTMPM-RAFT to react to form insoluble gel-like product. Rather, excess AIBN is used to remove the reactive terminus to form PTMPM, which can then be oxidized by meta-chloroperbenzoic acid to the desired PTMA. Despite the promise of the RAFT-mediated polymerization, reported radical concentration was only 69 ¬± 4%. =Rhodium catalyzed polymerization = Rhodium-catalyzed polymerization of TEMPO-bearing monomers avoids some of the challenges free-radical polymerization poses because an oxidation step to generate the radical is not needed. The structure of (2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1-yl)oxyl or TEMPO is shown below. Structure of 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidineoxyl (TEMPO) The following monomers (1-3) can be synthesized by condensation reaction between carboxyl groups with the amino or hydroxyl group of acetylene derivatives and various TEMPO derivatives. Polymerization of the monomers is completed using a Rhodium catalyst (nbd)Rh+[n6-C6H5B‚àí(C6H5)3].Katsumata, T.; Satoh, M.; Wada, J.; Shiotsuki, M.; Sanda, F.; Masuda, T. Macromol. Rapid Commun. 2006, 27 (15), 1206‚Äì1211. doi: 10.1002/marc.200600286 Rhodium catalyzed synthesis of TEMPO containing polymers has been performed with high quantitative yield. Rhodium-Catalyzed polymerization of TEMPO-bearing acetylene monomers While use of a rhodium catalyst may be advantageous due to its high yield, use of a metal catalyst provides the additional challenge of having to separate the catalyst from the final product. =Anionic polymerization = Direct anionic polymerization of nitroxyl-containing monomers has also been used to synthesis PTMA. Anionic polymerization is not ideal because it must be carried using very strict procedures to avoid side reactions. Using 1,1-diphenylhexylllithium as an initiator of the reaction eliminates some side reactions by steric effects,Allgaier, J.; Finkelmann, H. Makromol. Chem., Rapid Commun. 1993, 14 (5), 267‚Äì271. doi: 10.1002/marc.1993.030140502 however, the procedures necessary are not amenable to large-scale synthesis. = Group- transfer polymerization = Group-transfer polymerization, like rhodium- catalyzed polymerization of PTMA, allows for polymerization of nitroxyl radical monomers. Unlike rhodium-catalyzed monomers, group-transfer polymerization utilizes silicon to catalyze the polymerization. Synthesis of 4-Methacryloxyloxy-TEMPO Monomers Preparation of the monomer, 4-methacryloxyloxy-TEMPO can be accomplished by acylation of 4-hydroxy-TEMPO with methacryloyl chloride. GTP polymerization of PTMA Polymerization using 1-methoxy-2-methyl-1trimethylsilyloxy-propene (MTS) as a catalyst proceeds rapidly at room temperature to form PTMA. Tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) is used as an additional catalyst. The following is a rationale for group- transfer polymerization. Mechanistic rationale for group transfer polymerization of PTMA Advantages Organic radical batteries are much more environmentally friendly than Li-ion batteries because ORBs do not contain any metals that pose the problem of proper disposal. ORBs are non-toxic and non- flammable and do not require additional care when handling. Burning nitroxide radical polymers yields carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen oxide without ash or odor. While being environmentally friendly, they have properties that are otherwise comparable to Li-ion batteries: ORBs have a theoretical capacity of 147 mA h g‚Åª¬π, which is slightly higher than that of Li-ion batteries with 140 mA h g‚Åª¬π. ORBs also show comparable charge times and retain of charge- discharge capacity well, matching lithium-ion batteries at 75% of their initial charge after 500 cycles. Additionally, radical concentration in ORBs are stable enough at ambient conditions to remain unchanged for over a year. ORBs are also more flexible than Li-ion batteries, which would make them more adaptable to different design constraints, such as curved devices.  Disadvantages and difficulties faced in development A major difficulty in the development of ORBs is difficulty of synthesizing an appropriate negative electrode. This disadvantage arises because the redox reaction of the negative electrode is not fully reversible. Hybrid ORB/Li-ion batteries, in which the negative electrode is replaced by the one found in a Li-ion battery, have been proposed as a compromise to overcome this difficulty.Nakahara, K.; Oyaizu, K.; Nishide, H. Chemistry Letters 2011, 40 (3), 222‚Äì227. doi:10.1246/cl.2011.222 Polymerization reactions of the stable radical-containing monomer have also proved to be an area of difficulty in development. The stable organic radicals that are crucial to the functioning of the battery are sometimes consumed in side-reactions of various polymerization reactions. A research group has, however, successfully synthesized a cross-linked organic radical polymer while only losing 0.4% of the organic radicals in synthesis of the polymer.

Caliber 9mm P.A. includes various blank, gas or rubber ammunitions made for different use. 9mm P.A. Blank has also been used for theatrical purposes, including as a modification to muzzle-loading firearms, allowing early-modern muskets and the like to be fired on-stage without the actors learning the complex steps of loading with loose powder. Variants Each of the 9mm P.A. cartridge variants are distinguished by a proper color: green, yellow, blue, red, etc. 9mm P.A. ammunitions can be used for different purposes depending on the legislation, these include military training, cinema props, self-defense (rubber bullets can be used only in Russia), dog training, historical reenactment, holiday or new year celebration (mostly in Turkey, Germany and Italy). Colombia S.A. and other South American countries also allow the use of rubber bullets for self defense. The use of this ammunition also depends on the 9mm P.A. gun's barrel which can be of three kinds depending on the country's own gun legislation that can be more or less restrictive. Fully obstructed barrel are called \\"top firing\\" (or \\"top venting\\") for they have a long hole on the barrel's top while the muzzle is closed. \\"Front firing\\" (or \\"front venting\\") guns have a semi-obstructed barrel that allows for a flame, smoke or tear gas to be ejected out of the muzzle. According to American federal laws, both \\"front firing\\" and \\"top firing\\" new guns must be identified by a red plastic tip fixed on the muzzle.

He did not finish his bachelor's degree until 2008 because he was always too busy doing research out in the field. Dr Perry Ong, director of the Institute of Biology at the University of the Philippines Diliman summed it up at Co's wake by saying ‚ÄúLeonard Co entered UP as botany freshman in the early 70s and never left.‚Äù While practicing acupuncture he met his wife Glenda Flores, whom he married on June 12, 1990. In 2008, with Co already informally considered one of the foremost experts in his field, University of the Philippines Diliman named him the last graduate of the BS degree in Botany; some time in the decades since Co's enrollment, the course had been merged with the bachelor's degree in Zoology to form the Biology program. This unorthodox academic path also earned Co another distinction in the annals of UP: Co submitted his book on the medicinal plants of the Cordilleras in lieu of a thesis, making him the only student to graduate from the BS Botany degree without submitting a thesis. Co worked as a museum researcher at the University of the Philippines Institute of Biology, and as a senior botanist at the Conservation International-Philippines. Career Co was the founding president of the Philippine Native Plants Conservation Society. and received credit for discovering eight new species of plants. Aside from these, two species of Philippine endemic plants have been named in his honor: the Mycaranthes leonardi orchid and the Rafflesia leonardi, a parasitic plant species of the genus Rafflesia endemic to the Philippines and known for bearing the third largest flower in the world. A year before his death, Co also documented the flora of the Bataan National Park, coming up with a catalog that lists 160 unique plant species, essential for guiding reforestation efforts on the 23,668-hectare park centered around Mount Natib. Death and legacy  Co, forester Sofronio Cortez and farmer Julius Borromeo, were working on a biodiversity project under the auspices of the Energy Development Corporation when they were killed in an incident involving nine members of the 19th Infantry Battalion of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in the forests of Kananga, Leyte on November 15, 2010. He and the group were examining a tree when the shooting began, and three bullets hit Co; resulting in death within 20 minutes. He was 56. Members of the army unit claimed that Co's group had been caught in the crossfire in a fight between their unit and the New People's Army, but this claim was challenged by numerous investigating groups, including the Philippine National Police and the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights. The Department of Justice eventually filed charges against the soldiers involved, and the case is currently in the courts. During his wake, Co was conferred the rare honor of having his coffin briefly displayed in front of the University of the Philippines Diliman's copy of the UP Oblation - the iconic symbol of the University of the Philippines. In accordance to his wishes, a third of his ashes was scattered in the 16-hectare forest dynamics plot he built and worked on in Palanan, Isabela, up in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Another third was given to the UP Institute of Biology and scattered under one of UP's trees, to symbolize that Co would always be a part of the university. The last third of his ashes was given to his family. On May 2, 2011, Co was posthumously conferred the National Academy of Science and Technology's Hugh Greenwood Environmental Award for his contribution in profiling forest biodiversity.

Other buildings were moved two miles south close to the new constructed rail line. In 1891, the large church was moved to the city of Harper, Kansas where it now serves as a museum. The centerpiece of the town was a hotel that was partly disassembled and moved into the recently opened Cherokee Strip in Alva, Oklahoma in 1893. It remains in use there today, thanks to a successful local effort at restoration.Early History-The Runnymede in Kansas, 2007. Retrieved 22 November 2016. Runnymede's church was moved to Harper, Kansas in 1893, where it remains. A post office was opened in Runnymede in 1879, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1944. The community was named after Runnymede in England. William Desmond Taylor joined the Runnymede community in August 1891. On August 8, 1891 Taylor (as W. Deane Tanner) sailed to New York from Liverpool on the RMS Umbria with F. J. S. Turnly, per passenger lists. Taylor's arrival at Runnymede was noted (as Tanner) in the Harper Sentinel on August 28, 1891. In a 1914 Hollywood interview Taylor briefly discussed his time spent at Runnymede.

EBTC as an organisation is coordinated by EUROCHAMBRES, the Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The EBTC is headquartered in New Delhi.  History  It was during the ninth EU-India Summit in Marseille that EU and Indian leaders discussed regional situations, global issues, and the strengthening of EU-India relations. On 29 September 2008, the EU and India approved the launch of EBTC in India to support business-to-business and research co-operation between the EU and India.EU-India Joint Press communiqu√© \\"Marseille, 29 September 2008.\\" The project officially launched in October 2008, with an office in New Delhi and activities commencing in January 2009.

In January 2013, India became the 54th country to join the Enterprise Europe Network. The EBTC leads the Enterprise Europe Network India consortium along with its partners, the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) / Global Innovation & Technology Alliance (GITA), to provide business support services primarily to SME‚Äôs and entrepreneurs from the EU and India.Enterprise Europe Network \\"India joins the Network.\\" The EU-funded project ended on 29 February 2016, and EBTC is now an independent, self-sustainable company.

Mission  EBTC is promoting and indigenising European technologies as well as innovations to suit the local needs in India through various projects, programmes and initiatives, enabling Indo-European collaborations. EBTC endeavours to support the governments and private sector in India with in- depth information, knowledge of available technologies and frameworks, as well as access to the innovations and solutions created in European countries. Since its inception, EBTC has played a vital role in creating viable ecosystems for the EU cleantech sector to explore business and research opportunities in India. EBTC is actively supporting European innovations, technologies and solutions for the Indian market entry as a strategic advisor, from finding the right partner or project and facilitating collaborations and joint value propositions, to providing IPR advice, technology adaptation strategies, market exploration studies and inbound/outbound delegations. All of the above contributes to creating pilot projects on the ground. As an interlocutor on Europe-India policy issues, EBTC is striving to highlight matters pertaining to barriers restricting cross-border trade. Its vision hence is to become a single point of contact for the facilitation of EU-India collaborations. As part of its mandate to enhance EU-India cooperation, EBTC is also actively promoting Indian technologies to European counterparts.

It is headquartered in New York City. Its business intelligence product includes both a back-end powered by in-chip technology that enables non-technical users to join and analyze large data sets from multiple sources, and a front-end for creating visualizations, like dashboards and reports, on any device, including mobile.  History  Sisense was founded in 2004 in Tel Aviv by Elad Israeli, Eldad Farkash, Aviad Harell, Guy Boyangu and Adi Azaria. The company worked in stealth mode on research and development until 2010, when initial investors, including Genesis Partners, Opus Capital and Eli Farkash, provided $4 million in Series A financing. Amit Bendov was appointed CEO in July 2012. In April 2013, Sisense announced a $10 million series B funding round led by Battery Ventures, with participation from Genesis Partners and Opus Capital. In June 2014, new investor Draper Fisher Jurvetson Growth (DFJ Growth) led a $30 million series C funding round with participation from existing investors Battery Ventures, Genesis Partners and Opus Capital. In February 2013, as the first company in CrunchBase's \\"Developer Spotlight Program,\\" Sisense analyzed 10 years of CrunchBase data in a public interactive investment dashboard dubbed CrunchAnalytics. By analyzing a decade's worth of data about 100,000 companies, the dashboard provides the public with a research tool that enables users to query the data by different categories to see trends in investment over the past ten years. In 2015, Amir Orad was appointed CEO. Orad previously served as CEO of NICE Actimize. In January 2016, the company announced a new $50 million funding round led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation by Battery Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Genesis Partners and Opus Capital. The company's software is used by companies in 49 countries. Customers include Target. In February 2018, the company was listed as a Visionary on the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms. In September 2018, the company announced another $80 million funding round led by Insight Venture Partners. In May 2019, Sisense acquired Periscope Data, creating a company with more than $120 million in annual recurring revenue, and over 900 employees. Finally, in January 2020, Sisense completed another round of funding at approximately $100m with a valuation exceeding $1b, cementing its status as a unicorn. Sisense continues to operate in the data and analytics space with over 2500 customers.  Technology  In April 2013, Sisense introduced an alternative to in-memory technology called In-Chip analytics, designed to maximize the disk, memory and CPU with resulting low latency. In May 2013, Sisense unveiled Prism 10X, which allows users to analyze 100 times more data at 10 times the speed of in-memory solutions. The company's In-Chip Analytics technology couples a columnar database with smart algorithms that use the in- chip cache, RAM or disk as needed instead of relying solely on RAM or disk. In October 2013, Sisense introduced Crowd Accelerated BI, a technology that allows companies to scale users by providing faster query results as load increases and scale to thousands of simultaneous users on a single box. Each query is broken down to its basic components, which then helps the software decide which data to store on disk and which data to bring to memory. As more queries are cataloged, the software is able to more quickly recognize future similar queries and call up relevant data. In April 2017, Sisense introduced Sisense Pulse which provides alert when it detects results outside of normal parameters for a particular metric.

It is a product service system more closely aligned to a bicycle sharing system than to carsharing. In a presentation by Bradley Schroeder at the Asian region meeting of the Institute for Transportation Development Policy in Jakarta, Indonesia, in June 2014, Bradley Schroeder introduced the term e2W to describe such systems. In his book Bicycle Sharing 101: Getting the Wheels Turning'', Schroeder concluded that \\"An area of potential huge growth is whether e-bike sharing can replace private scooter trips in Asian cities, where scooter use can be up to 75 percent.‚Äù In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, 78% of trips are made by scooters or motorcycles, with annual growth rates of 8.4% to the total fleet, according to the Asian Development Bank. Motivations for the implementation of e2W systems are that they would provide an alternative to privately owned motorized two- wheeled vehicles, allowing the political will to regulate motor bikes in terms of parking, acceleration, top speeds, tail-pipe emissions and sound pollution.

It is an official remake of 2013 film Aashiqui 2. The name is taken from the song of the same name from the 2014 film, Yevadu. Sachiin J Joshi, Nazia Hussain and Rao Ramesh are in lead roles. Plot Raghava Jairam (Sachiin J Joshi) ‚Äì a successful singer and musician whose career is waning because of his alcohol addiction ‚Äì is on stage in Goa when his performance is interrupted by his rival Varun (Aadarsh Balakrishna). After a fight, Raghav leaves the venue and drives to a local bar, where he meets Gayathri Nandan (Nazia), a bar singer who idolises him. Seeing her looking at a photograph of Lata Mangeshkar in the bar, and impressed by her voice, Raghava promises to transform her into a singing sensation, and asks her never to perform again in bars. Gayathri leaves her job and returns to Hyderabad with Raghav, who convinces record producer Suresh (Rao Ramesh) to meet her. Raghava is attacked and injured by some thugs, and his manager Vivek (Shashank) prevents the news being leaked to the media; instead he spreads the story that Raghav has left the country to perform abroad. After two months of unsuccessfully attempting to contact Raghav, a broken Gayathri is forced to sing in bars again. Meanwhile, Raghav recovers from his injuries and starts searching for Gayathri. He learns that Vivek had ignored her calls without informing him. Raghav apologises to Gayathri and fires Vivek, and they meet Suresh to sign a recording agreement. Raghav begins to train Gayathri, who becomes a successful playback singer. When gossip spreads that Raghav is using her as a servant, he relapses into alcohol addiction. Gayathri comforts him and they spend the night together. Despite her mother's disapproval, she moves in with Raghav and things go well until his addiction worsens, causing him to become aggressive and violent. Gayathri attempts to rehabilitate Raghav, sacrificing her singing career in doing so. After Suresh reminds them about their dream of Gayathri becoming a successful singer, Raghav tells her to focus on her work. During Gayathri's stage show, Raghav meets a journalist who accuses him of using Gayathri for pleasure and money. Raghav beats up the journalist and starts drinking. He ends up in jail, and Gayathri comes to bail him out. Raghav overhears Gayathri telling Suresh that she is going to give up her career because Raghav is more important to her. He sees that he has become a burden and that leaving her is his only option to save her. The next day, he bids her farewell by assuring her that he will change his lifestyle and dies in a road accident. Distraught by Raghav's death, Gayathri decides to give up her career but Vivek persuades her to stay, reminding her that Raghav wanted her to become a successful singer and killed himself because he did not want to be an obstacle in the path of her success. Gayathri agrees, and returns to singing. After four years she is shown with her 4-year-old son, whose name is Raghava Jairam. Cast and crew * Sachiin J Joshi as Raghav Jayaram a.k.a.
